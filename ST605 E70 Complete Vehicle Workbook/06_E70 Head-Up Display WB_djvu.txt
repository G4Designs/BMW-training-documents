Head-up Display (HUD) 


The very name "Head-up" describes the principle benefit of this 
system.The Head-up display (HUD) projects important informa¬ 
tion such as cruise control data or instructions from the navigation 
arrow are reflected onto a special glass windshield and are thus 
permanently in the driver's field of vision. 

This include the display of: 

• Cruise control DCC Data 

• Navigation system information 

• Check Control messages 

• Vehicle speed. 

This HUD system is similar to that of the 6 Series and 5 Series 
with enhanced features and service adjustment procedures. 



The separate components of the head-up display are the cover 
glass, 2 mirrors, LED power supply, LED array, TFT projection dis¬ 
play, PCB and casing. The head-up display can only be replaced 
as a complete unit. It is not possible to replace components or 
separate parts.

Head-up display HUD 














A TFT (Thin Film Transistor) is a (silicon based) three layersemi- 
conductor.The device is a millimeterthickand allows lightto shine 
through a filter when an electrical current is applied. TFTs project 
precise colors when subjected to a potent light source and are the 
technology used on modern Thin Film Transistor Active Matrix 
Liquid Crystal Displays (TFTAMLCD). 

An LED array acts as this light source. The image content is creat¬ 
ed by the (TFT)Thick FilmTransistor projection display. The TFT 
projection display can be compared to a filter which admits or 
blocks light. 

An optical imaging element determines the shape, distance and 
size of the HUD images. The image appears to float freely over the 
road, the windshield acts as a deflecting mirror. 

Display Area 

The HUD size is approximately 200 mm x 100 mm with a display 
resolution of 480 x240 pixels.The HUD is separated into 2 display 
areas. The individual fields are "optically" separated in the image so 
that they can be identified more easily. 

The upper area shows navigation information and CC messages in 
the form of symbols, bar display and text. 

The lower area shows speed-related displays in the form of unit, 
current speed and cruise control.

Mirrors 

Unlike the previous system two mirrors, instead of four, are fitted in 
the head-up display to reflect the information onto the windshield 
surface. 



The convex mirror (1) is responsible for compensating the image 
on the windshield and forthe size and distance of the image. 

The flat mirror (2) is a deflecting mirror to keep the beam in the 
space provided. The convex mirror is made of plastic while the flat 
mirror is made of glass. 

Adjusting the Brightness 

The brightness of the HUD can be individually adjusted via the CID 
The brightness is adjusted as follows: 

• Call up the main menu by pressing the menu button 

• Press the Controller and select the "Settings" menu item 

• Turn the Controller until "Displays/Screen" is highlighted in the 
menu bar and then confirm by pressing the Controller; the 
upper menu bar is activated 


• Turn the Controller until "Head-up display brightness" is high¬ 
lighted in the upper bar and then confirm 

• Set the desired brightness by turning the Controller and con¬ 
firm by pressing.

Adjusting the Height of the Horizon 

To adjust the location of the image and the Eye box, the iDrive con¬ 
troller is used to move a stepper motor. 

The Eye box can be shifted up to a maximum of ± 30 mm upwards 
or downward. The height setting is adjusted as follows: 

• Call up the main menu by pressing the menu button 

• Press the Controller and select the "Settings" menu item 

• Turn the Controller until "Displays/Screen" is highlighted in the 
menu bar and then confirm by pressing the Controller; the 
upper menu bar is activated 

• Turn the Controller until "Position" is highlighted in the upper 
bar and then confirm 

• Set the desired height by turning the Controller and confirm by 
pressing.

Vertical Rotation of the HUD 

The HUD image can be rotated in the horizontal by a service tech¬ 
nician using the DIS (vertical rotation), after a replacing a wind¬ 
shield, for instance. 

Note: The vertical rotation is adjusted via a stepper motor 
in steps of 0.25° from -3° to +3° with the DIS. 
Detailed information may be found in the BMW diag¬ 
nostic system. 

Image Defects 

Incorrect installation of the HUD or of the windshield may result in 
faulty HUD projections. Some faults which may occur when the 
HUD orthe windshield are fitted are shown in the next page. 


Note: The HUD incorporates operating-hours counters for 
both the HUD and the LED array. When the HUD is 
replaced, the operating hours counter must be 
initialized to 0. 


Correcting Distortion (warping) 

S hould the image be distorted after a change of windshield, the 
image display can be improved using the Warping function. 
Warping is the technical term forthe improvement of the image 
display.

Note: Unlike the previous system, no special tools are 

needed to adjust the head-up display.Vertical (rota¬

BMW diagnostic system.
