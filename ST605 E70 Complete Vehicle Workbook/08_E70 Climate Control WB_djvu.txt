Climate Control System 


The E70 X5 climate control system has been extensively 
enhanced and re designed compared with that of the E53 X5.The 
overall performance of the system was increased with respect to 
cooling and heating output.The E70's Climate Control system is 
designed as a water based temperature control and has Four 
Temperature Zone capability, depending on equipment variant. 

There are three equipment options available for U.S. vehicles: 

• IHKA, integrated automatic heating / air conditioning system 
(2-zone) 

• IHKA with FKA rear automatic air conditioning system 
(4-zone) 

• Optional 3rd row heating and ventilation system on the 
5+2 seat package 


IHKA allows the temperature and the air flaps at the left and right 
sides of the vehicle to be controlled separately for the driver and 
the front passenger. The vehicle interior is controlled in two zones 
(2-zone) in accordance with these individual settings. 

FKA is the rear automatic air conditioning system and has its own 
operating and control module in the rear. This control module is 
used to operate individual heating/air conditioning adjusting facili¬ 
ties for the rear passengers. 

The optionally available FKA gives the rear passengers the oppor¬ 
tunity to make separate temperature settings for the left and right 
sides of the vehicle and control the blower in the rear. The vehicle 
interior is controlled in four zones (4- zone) in accordance with 
these four individual settings. 

Stand-alone heating and ventilation system forthe third row of 
seats is also available forthe optional 5+2 seat package. Heating 
is realized with the use of a PTC electrical heater and ventilation 
through the use of a blowerfan located inside the 3rd row heating 
and ventilation unit. 


Note: In efforts to reduce C02 emissions, all E70 vehicles 
will be fitted with A/C compressors with magnetic 
clutches. Vehicles with the N62 engine will initially 
be equipped with clutchless A/C compressors, but 
in later production will come with magnetic clutches. 





IHKA 



IHKA has ten actuator motors in total with four separate motors for 
airflap control. 

Fresh air or recirculated air can be routed directly to the air ducts 
via the evaporator and appropriate bypass, without being routed 
through the system's heater core. The airflow (fresh air or recircu¬ 
lated air) is first routed via the evaporator in the heating/ air-condi¬ 
tioning housing, provided that the A/C compressor has been acti¬ 
vated, cooled and then heated to the required temperature via the 
heating system. 

Due to its dual section heater core, the IHKA allows separate and 
individual 2- zone, right/left temperature control. This is achieved in 
part, through the use of left and right temperature sensors. The 
desired temperature is fine tuned via two water control valves 
(left/right). The water flow through the heater core is aided with the 
use of an auxiliary water pump in the case of vehicles with the N62 
engine (the N52 engine has an electric water pump thus no auxil¬ 
iary pump is needed)

IHKA with FKA Rear Automatic AirConditioning 
System (4-zone) 

The 4-zone air conditioning system consists of the standard 
2-zone IHKA plus: 

• Its own FKA controls 

• Four additional outlet temperature sensors 

• A separate rear blower 

• Air ducts and outlets in the B-pillars 

• Two separate PTC heating elements in the rearfootwell 
air ducts 

• Three additional actuator motors for air flap control of the 
system (IHKA with FKA, total of thirteen actuator motors) 

The Climate Control Menu allows us to activate orde-activate the 
FKA rear climate control via the controller. A checked box next to 
"Activate Rear Climate Control" function will show the system acti¬ 
vated. The FKA control settings can be taken over by selecting the 
"Use Driver Settings” function that synchronizes FKA settings with 
the driver-side IHKA system settings. However, as soon as the FKA 
controls are operated by the rear occupants the rear controls 
become active once again.

Air Distribution Adjustment 

When the rocker button forthe vent selection is operated, an "Air 
distribution" pop-up menu appears on the control display. The air 
distribution may be tailored to preference 

The air stratification (ventilation temperature) can also be adjusted 
via the controller in this menu at the same time as the air distribu¬ 
tion is being adjusted.

Automatic Programs (Gentle, Medium, Intensive) 

The IHKA control module can be used to select and adjust the 
automatic program using the AUTO button as a rocker button or via 
the controller. 

The three different automatic programs: 

• Gentle 

• Medium 

• Intensive 

Each have their own characteristic curves for blower control, air dis¬ 
tribution and airflap control. This enables the occupant to select 
between three different IHKA programs that achieve the requested 
climate change at different levels of performance in automatic 
mode without having to switch to manual mode.

Rain/Light Solar Sensor 

The new rain/light solar sensor RLSS of the E70 is clipped into a 
retaining ring beneath the windshield mirror base cover. The 
rain/light solar sensor separately records the insolation acting upon 
the vehicle occupants forthe left and right halves of the vehicle. 

It generates two signals that are proportional to the insolation act¬ 
ing upon the vehicle occupants.The sensorsignal is read by the 
FZD via the LIN bus and relayed to the IHKA via the K-CAN.

Heating/Ventilation forThird Row of Seats 

The optional 3rd row heating/ventilation blower is activated using a 
button located on the 3rd row center air outlet vent between the 
third row seats. 

The air distribution of the auxiliary unit can be selected up forthe 
center air vent and down forthe footwell (floor) air vents using a 
knurled wheel with control flap. 

A PTC heating element in the air duct is activated by a micro¬ 
switch when the DOWN limit stop of the air outlet knurled wheel is 
reached. 

•The heated airflows out the footwell vents of the 3rd row area. 

•The heating function can only be activated with the blower 
switched on. 

•The air volume cannot be controlled.

The output of the heating element is controlled depending on inte¬ 
rior temperature in three stages from 0 - 100% (<20°C = 100%, > 
20°C =50%, >30°C =0% PTC output). 

The DM E (ECM) (by means of a CAN signal to the IHKA and to the 
HB3SR control module via the LIN bus) can reduce the power of 
the heating element (power reduction of 50% or cut off) within the 
scope of power management.
