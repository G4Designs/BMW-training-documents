Central Locking 


The central locking is the central vehicle access system. It is 
responsible for unlocking and locking the vehicle. The central 
locking controls all vehicle doors, the upper section of the two- 
piece tailgate and the fuel filler flap. 

The central locking can be operated via the following compo¬ 
nents: 

• Remote control 

• Driver's door lock barrel (door lock) 

• Center lock button 

• Exterior tailgate button 

• Identification transmitter and outer door handle electronic 
module TAGE for Comfort Access. 

A correspondingly adapted electrical system taken from the E90 is 
used in the E70. Forthis reason, many components and functions 
stem from the E90. 

The Car Access System now features the third generation of con¬ 
trol units.The electronic vehicle immobilizer4 is also used in con¬ 
nection with the Car Access System 3.The Car Access System 3 
is backwards compatible with the Car Access System 2. 
Therefore, the Car Access System 3 contains all the functions of 
its predecessor. 

It is possible to open and close the vehicle both actively or pas¬ 
sively. Option SA 322 Comfort Access is required forthe passive 
opening and closing function. 

Note:The lower section ofthe tailgate is fully mechanical 
and can be opened as soon as the upper section has 
been opened.

Wipers 


The E70 is equipped with two Windshield wipers and one rear 
window wiper as standard. 

The wiperfunction is possible in the following modes: 

• Intermittent wipe 

• Continuous wipe in Stage 1 

• Continuous wipe in Stage 2 

• Flick wipe 

The E70 can be optionally equipped with headlight washer sys¬ 
tem option 502. It is equipped with rain/driving lights/solar sensor 
and heated nozzles as standard. 

The wipe/wash system on the E70 is a conventional wipe/wash 
system. This means that the wiper motors are equipped with a 
reset contact.

Rain Sensor 

With the aid of three infrared transmit diodes and infrared receive 
diodes, the rain sensor evaluates the moisture level on the 
Windshield. 


The rain sensor signals the detected rain situation to the roof 
functions center via the LIN-bus. In turn, the roof functions center 
transfers the information on the K-CAN. In this way, the junction 
box control unit receives the request to switch the windshield 
wiper on or off. 


Three rain ranges are created by combining infrared transmit 
diodes and infrared receive diodes in pairs.The rain ranges are 
used to determine the rain intensity. 



Rain detection is based on the reflection of the infrared light at 
the boundary surface from the glass of the Windshield to air. 
The reflection is dependent on the level of soiling and moisture 
on the Windshield. 


The infrared light is reflected in full when 
the Windshield is clean and dry. 





The signals are: 

• Sensor status 

• Rain intensity 

• Wiper speed 

• Interval period 


The reflection of the infrared light is reduced by dirt or rain water on 
the Windshield.

Driving Lights Sensor 


SolarSensor 


The driving lights sensor registers the ambient light and the light 
levels in front of the vehicle (front end). A sensorforeach of these 
areas is integrated in the rain/driving lights/solar sensor. 

The rain/driving lights/solar sensor informs the roof functions center 
of the driving lights situation via the LIN-bus, i.e. driving lights on/off 
and reason for switching on. 

The roof functions center packs the signals into the corresponding 
K-CAN telegram and sends it. In this way, the footwell module 
receives the request to switch the driving lights on or off (when the 
automatic driving lights function is active). 


The signals are: 

• Status of driving lights sensor • Status of driving lights 

• Ambient brightness level • Reason for switching on.

The solar sensor is assigned purely to the scope offunctions of the 
automatic heating and air conditioning system. 

The solar sensor measures the angle of solar radiation (insolation) 
on to the vehicle. The solar radiation is measured separately on the 
driver's and front passenger's side. 



At times the solar radiation comes from the front, from the side or 
sometimes from the rear due to the changes 
in direction while driving.The sensor 
therefore registers the solar radiation at 
all times. 

Persons in the vehicle are sub¬ 
jected to these changing lev¬ 
els of solar radiation (insola¬ 
tion). Consequently, more 
heat is felt in the area of 
solar radiation than in the 
area with no solar radiation.

The solar sensor measures 
the solar radiation on to the 
vehicle depending on the 
position of the car with 
respect to the sun.

The values from the solar enable the integrated automatic heating 
and air conditioning system (climate control) to respond according¬ 
ly and create a pleasant climate in the vehicle. The roof functions 
center receives the values from the solar sensor via the LIN-bus 
and forwards the values on the K-CAN to the integrated automatic 
heating and air conditioning system (climate control). 






























The occurrence of small bubbles on the silicon gel layer (adhesive 
layer) is OK (permitted) when replacing the optical element. Please 
remember to initialize the rain/driving lights/solar sensor. 


The front end light sensor is directed at the area of the road which 
is also used for the head-up display. The brightness level of the 
representation in the head-up display can thus be adapted to the 
light situation. 

This is necessary for example when driving through a tunnel with 
the head-up display switched on. 

Installation of the rain/driving lights/solar sensor in the E70 requires 
the installation of the roof functions center with maximum equip¬ 
ment configuration. Consequently, the maximum equipment con¬ 
figuration of the interior lighting system is also installed. 

Note: The rain/driving lights/solar sensor can best be 

distinguished simply by looking at the Windshield. 

If the rain/driving lights/solar sensor has two clear 
lenses then it is for the head-up display. 

The optical element and the electronics of the rain/driving 
lights/solar sensor can be replaced separately. 

Note: An exception is the rain/driving lights/solar sensor 
for the head-up display. This rain/driving lights/solar 
sensor can be replaced only as a complete unit. The 
reason forth is is that the optical element and the 
electronics need to be matched (calibrated) in the 
sensorforthe head-up display.This is currently 
possible only as part of the rain/driving lights/solar 
sensor manufacturing process. 


RLSS Variants 

Two versions of the rain/driving lights/solar sensor are used in 
the E70.The version depends on whether a head-up display is 
installed in the vehicle or not. The optics in the front end light 
sensorthat are pervious to infrared light are replaced by clear 
optics forthe head-up display.

ComfortAccess 


Using ComfortAccess the customer can unlock and open the 
vehicle without active use of the ID transmitter. It is unimportant 
how the customer wishes to access the vehicle. It is important that 
the ID transmitter be located in the vehicle's immediate vicinity 
(approximately 2m). It is sufficient to have the ID transmitter some¬ 
where on your person. 



The system is based on the ComfortAccess on the E90/E91. 
Inserting a hand into the handle recess of the outside doorhandle 
unlocks and then opens the vehicle.The vehicle is locked by 
touching the sensitive area of the outside doorhandle.

Seats 


Front Row Seating 


Third Row Seating 


There are two different seats available: 

• Sport seat 

• M ultifunction seat (comfort seat) option 


The Passenger seating capacity can be extended to seven by 
ordering the third row seating option.The additional two seats are 
situated in the luggage compartment and can be folded down 
completely. 


Second Row Seating 

The E70 is afive-seaterin its standard equipment specification, 
two seats in the front (driver and Passenger) and three seats in the 
row just behind the front seats. This is referred to as second row 
seating (back seat). It offers the opportunity of folding down the 
backrest completely, thereby increasing the luggage-compartment 
volume.The backrest are divided into two parts, the ratio being 
60/40. 


Front and Second Row Seating 



This row of seats is referred to as third row seating or 5 + 2 seat 
concept and are not equipped with seat heaters. However, an 
independent heating unit option is available just for the third row 
seats.

The Seat heating option is also available for second row seats. 

Seat heating is an option The seat heating option cannot be 
ordered individually. This means that it can only be ordered in 
conjunction with the Front Seat-heating option. 

Seat heating forthe second row is available in two equipment 
specifications: 

• Without automatic rear-cabin air conditioning 

• With automatic rear-cabin air conditioning 

Rear Seat Heating without Automatic Rear-cabin 
AirConditioning 

The seat heating features two heating circuits each in the right and 
left seat halves. Each of the heating circuits has a heating area for 
the backrest and the seat cushion. 

The seat heating is connected to the "Terminal 15" relay. The seat 
heating can therefore only be activated from "Terminal 15 ON". 

The seat heating can be switched on individually for the left or right 
seat half with buttons. 

The seat-heating buttons are integrated underthe air vents in the 
rear center console. 

The seat heating can be switched on in two heating stages. The 
heating stages and their indications are set out in the following 
table.The seat heating is controlled by means of an NTC resistor 
in the heating mat of the seat surface. The buttons are 
resistance-coded and make a different supply voltage available for 
the seat heating.

The seat heating has two heating circuits, as described above. 

It does, however, have a seat-heating seat module. 

The function of the seat heating is integrated completely in the 
seat-heating seat module.The seat-heating seat module is con¬ 
nected to terminal 30 for the load current. 

The seat heating can be activated from the status "Terminal 15 
ON". Automatic rear cabin air conditioning receives the status 
"Terminal 15 ON" via the K-CAN.

The buttons for operating the seat heating are integrated in the 
control panel for automatic rear-cabin air conditioning. The auto¬ 
matic rear-cabin air conditioning ECU evaluates the buttons and 
activates the seat heating depending on the selected heating 
stage. 

The seat-heating seat module is supplied with a pulse-width-mod¬ 
ulated signal for this purpose. The pulse width corresponds to the 
required heating stage. 

The seat-heating seat module executes the request and monitors 
the seat heating. The seat-heating seat module determines the set 
temperature by means of an NTC resistor in the heating mat of the 
seat surface.

Second Row Seat Locking 

The locking function of the seat bench in the second seat row is 
monitored. For example, a locked seat bench ensures that it cannot 
come loose during driving and result in passenger injuries. 

The second row seats are divided into a large and a small seat 
sections. The ratio is 60-40. Therefore, the large seat portion has 
four M icro-witches while the small seat portion has one M icro- 
switch for monitoring the lock. 

The junction-box ECU issues a signal as soon as the contact to the 
ground connection is interrupted.The signal alerts the customer 
that the second row is not locked correctly. 

The Large Seat Section 

M icro-witches are installed for the backrest and seat surface for 
monitoring the large seat section. On the backrest there is only one 
M icro-switch, on the outside. 

There are two further M icro-witches in the seat bottom, on the 
inside and outside of the locks. Another Micro-switch is located on 
the seat-cushion arm in the seat bottom to detect when the back¬ 
rest is in the fully set-down in position and locked. 

All the switches are closed when the seat section is correctly 
locked. One of the switches of a locked seat is always open or 
closed. The following seat states are monitored: 

• Large seat half, backrest, folded up and locked 

• Large seat half, backrest, folded down 

• Large seat half, seat surface tilted 

• Large seat half, seat surface locked 


The Small Seat Section 

The small seat section is monitored by a M icro-switch, since there 
is no belt integrated in the backrest.The Micro-switch is situated 
on the mechanical lock on the inside of the seat bottom. The 
switch is closed when this seat is correctly locked.

J unction-Box ECU 

The junction-box ECU is the monitoring electronic control unit. In 
the event of an incorrectly locked seat, the junction-box ECU no 
longer has ground contact with this pin. 

The signal level therefore changes from Low to High.The junction- 
box ECU issues a check control message and alerts the driverto 
an unlocked seat. 

Third Row Seat 

The seat concept described above can be extended by the 5+2 
seat concept. This is available as the 5+2 seat-extension option. 
The additional two seats are situated in the luggage compartment 
and can be folded down completely. This seat row is the third row 
in the E70. 

These seats are not equipped with seat heating. However, an 
independent heating option is available for the third row. More 
information can be found in the Product Information "E70 
Heating /AirConditioning". 

Seat-position Recognition, US Version 

The US version of the driver seat has seat position recognition. 
Seat-position recognition indicates where longitudinally the seat is 
situated (distance to the steering wheel). In this way, the distance 
between the driver and the steering wheel can be detected. 

The ACSM requires this information so that it can fire the airbag 
under defined conditions. A more detailed description can be 
found in the Product Information "E70 Advanced Crash Safety 
Management". 

Seat-position recognition is calibrated at the factory. The positions 
in the front and rear longitudinal seat direction are known to the 
seat module. A maximum distance is available for longitudinal seat 
adjustment. 


This stretches from the mechanical front stop to the mechanical 
rear stop. The motorfor adjustment in the longitudinal direction 
generates Hall pulses over this distance. The seat modules uses 
these Hall pulses to identify the current (absolute) seat position. 

An area for example in which a person of short stature would sit is 
defined in the longitudinal direction.The absolute seat position can 
be lost due to specific causes. The seat must therefore be calibrat¬ 
ed. Please refer to the Service Information.

Steering Column Switch Electronics 


A steering column switch cluster SZL is used on the E70 that can 
detect the steering angle and the settings of the steering column 
switches for wiper, direction indicator light and cruise control by 
means of optical sensors. 

In addition to the optical sensors, buttons based on switching-mat 
technology are used for the buttons on the multifunction steering 
wheel and various buttons on the steering column stalks.The 
voltage signals are read by the steering column switch cluster. 

The information from the switches and steering angle sensor are 
in part processed in the steering column switch cluster and trans¬ 
ferred to other systems via the F-CAN. A part of the information is 
forwarded directly to other control units. 

Note: In terms of design and function, the steering 
column switch clusteressentially corresponds 
to the steering column switch clusteron the E90. 

A new feature is the electronic steering wheel 
module that is responsible for controlling the 
steering wheel heating. 


Steering Wheel Heating 

The steering wheel heating is controlled by the electronic steering 
wheel module.The electronic steering wheel module is accom¬ 
modated in the steering wheel. 

The steering wheel heating is activated by means of a switch on 
the steering wheel. The switch is connected directly to the elec¬ 
tronic steering wheel module. The power is supplied via two dedi¬ 
cated connections. 

To prevent overloading the electrical system, the function can be 
deactivated by the IHKA by means of a power-down connection.

The interior lighting in the E70 is based on the interior lighting 
system implemented in the E90.The interior lighting comprises 
the roof area, luggage compartment, footwell and inner door 
lighting. 

The lighting in outer area of the doors is provided by the 
courtesy lighting (outer door handles) and the exit lights. The inte¬ 
riorlighting in the roof area on the rear driver and passenger sides 
consists of two separate lamps. A new feature is the split glove 
compartment. 

The complete glove compartment lighting is powered and 
controlled by an electronic module in the unlocking/release 
drive unit.

Exterior Lighting 


The exterior lighting in the E70 is based on the exterior lighting 
system implemented in the E90.The E70 features the welcome 
light, making the vehicle even more customer-friendly. 

The exterior lighting system is switched on for approximately 20 
seconds when the vehicle is unlocked.This has the advantage of 
locating the vehicle more easily under unfavorable light conditions. 

A further feature is the daytime driving light that can be activated 
or deactivated via the Personal Profile.

Park Distance Control / RearView Camera 


Park Distance Control 

The Park Distance Control (PDC) is a distance warning system 
that provides both visual and audible information on the distance 
to the nearest obstacle when parking and driving out of spaces. 

The park distance control is optionally available in the E70. 

The distance to the next obstacle is measured by means of four 
ultrasonic sensors in the rear bumper and four ultrasonic sensors 
in the front bumper. The distance is signalled audibly via the 
speakers in the rear and front area of the vehicle. The frequency of 
the signal increases as the distance to the obstacle decreases. 

A continuous signal is output in very close proximity to obstacles 
(about 30 cm). 

The distance signalling is shown in graphic form on the central 
information display C ID. 

The park distance control can be switched on and off by means of 
a button in the center console switch cluster SZM. 

The following changes/new features have been implemented 
compared to the predecessor models: 

• New converter and new control unit 

• Visual representation of distance to obstacle 

- via display generated by the CCC 

- via display generated by the RearView Camera 

• Audible signalling through audio system speakers 


RearView Camera 

The Rear-view camera system (RFK) serves to assist the driver 
when driving into/out of parking spaces and maneuvering. 

As well as showing a high-quality wide-angle image of the area 
behind the vehicle, the system contains a series of additional 
customerfunctions. 

The system is located in the tailgate. The Rear-view camera is 
located offset to the right of vehicle center in the tailgate strip 
handle. 

The Rear-view camera is activated automatically together with the 
park distance control by engaging reverse gear or manually by 
pressing the parking button. A wide angle color image of the area 
behind the vehicle is shown on the central screen.The electronic 
equalizer ensures natural perspectives in the image. Driver assis¬ 
tance graphics in the image show the calculated space require¬ 
ment for parking into spaces and maneuvering referred to the 
current steering wheel position thus assisting the driver when 
parking into spaces.The shaded obstacle markings in the real 
camera image that are based on the ultrasonic sensor system 
help the driver (in addition to the PDC warning tone) to pay partic¬ 
ular attention to obstacles and confined areas when parking into 
spaces and maneuvering. 

Selection menus on the central information display allow for inter¬ 
active changes to the system settings. Automatic activation of the 
system can also be disabled in these menus. Following activation 
after opening the vehicle, the rear-view camera is not available 
before the navigation display is operational.

Basic Functions of the Rear-view Camera System 

The basic function of the rear-view camera system is to record 
optically a wide-angle view (about 120°) of the area behind the 
vehicle. The image is recorded via the lens in the rear-view camera 
system and then transmitted in electronically conditioned form to 
the car communication computer (CCC). 

The video picture is transmitted via a video interface (CVBS, RGB). 
Communication for controlling the system in the entire vehicle and 
connection to the overall-bus system are effected via a K-CAN 
interface. 

In addition, the rear-view camera system serves to show further 
assorted assistance information in the form of superimposed over¬ 
lays (graphics and text) in the output signal (superimposed with the 
real camera picture). 

Image Reproduction Functions 

The rear-view camera system shows the view of the area behind 
the vehicle with a horizontal aperture angle of 120° on the central 
information display.The view can be shown on the navigation dis¬ 
play in two modes: 



Full image view 620x240 pixels 



Main window view 400x240 pixels

Electronic Image Equalization 

The rear-view camera features an electronic image equalizerthat 
corrects the distortions in vertical and horizontal correction caused 
by the principle of the wide-angle lens. The equalization algorithm 
must be such that the secondary effects such as information loss 
in the form of blurred edges as well as distortion that occurs as part 
ofthe equalization process are minimized. 

The aim is to achieve the most realistic representation ofthe view 
ofthe area behind the vehicle that can be unmistakably interpreted 
by the driver. 


The Rear-view camera system always provides a view of a certain 
section ofthe overall image. This makes it possible to adapt to the 
external conditions ofthe vehicle. If the vehicle is parked on uneven 
ground so that it is not straight, the Rear-view camera system can 
adapt the video image corresponding to the incoming information. 

This function is required for realizing the functions described in 
the following: 

• Virtual camera pan 

• Image adaptation to vehicle inclination 

• Software-based system calibration 

Virtual Camera Pan 

Different areas are shown on the screen in vertical direction 
depending on the driving speed. 

The bottom area ofthe image 
(from the bumper up to the 
horizontal) is shown when 
rear-view at slow speed 
(up to about 3 mph). 


Increasingly only the upper 
area ofthe image (from about 
lm distance from the vehicle 
up to a minimum angle of 10° 
above the horizontal) is shown 
on the screen when rear-view 
at faster speed (more than 
3 mph).

Camera Pan as a Function of Speed 

The camera pans virtually without the camera moving mechanically. 
This function gives the driver a view of the area behind the vehicle 
adapted to the current speed. When driving at slow speed, the area 
very close to the rear of the vehicle is shown so that every detail 
can be recognized. At speeds above 3 mph, the upper section of 
the image is shown to provide an extended view. 



Additional Functions of the Rear-view 
Camera System 

Assistance Graphics in Camera Image 

Assistance graphics are superimposed on the camera image to 
help the driver to park into spaces and maneuver. 

The following assistance graphics can be superimposed: 

• Lane help lines 

• Turning circle lines 

• Obstacle markings 

• Zoom of towing hitch 



Note: The brightness can be adjusted orthe image 
completely switched off 


























Lane Help Lines 

The lane help lines are used to show the predicted path of the 
vehicle and therefore the required maneuvering space depending 
on the current position of the steering wheel. The lane help lines 
are deactivated automatically when driving in forward direction. 



Turning Circle Lines 

The turning circle lines mark the minimum possible vehicle turning 
circle.These marks remain superimposed on the image also when 
driving in forward direction. 



Only the relevant turning circle line is shown as soon as the driver 
turns the steering wheel. The opposite turning circle line is blanked 
out depending on the steering lock and is no longer shown at full 
lock. 



Obstacle Markings 

Obstacle markings shown in the real camera image are partly trans¬ 
parent overlays true to scale of the obstacle detected by the PDC. 
The obstacle distribution in the area behind the vehicle is shown as 
a 3D graphic. Its form, position and color depend on the distance to 
each of the four PDC sensors in the bumper. Through correspon¬ 
ding visualization with form and color, the way the obstacle mark¬ 
ings are represented gives the driver a spatial perspective of the 
obstacle distribution about the area behind the vehicle. The view 
corresponds to the virtual PDC view.

Personal Profile 

The settings last made by each user are stored in the Rear-view 
camera system and retrieved after corresponding identification. 
The following setting options can be stored in the rear-view cam¬ 
era depending on the vehicle key. 

• Display format (full image, main window as well as 
permanently switch on/off camera image) 

• Lane help lines (ON/OFF) 

• Turning circle lines (ON/OFF) 

• Obstacle markings (ON/OFF) 

• Camera pan (ON/OFF) 

• Image brightness (brightness value) 

System Activation 

System activation by driverThe Rear-view camera system can be 
activated by the driver by pressing the parking aid button (PDC 
button) as from terminal 15. The system can no longer be activat¬ 
ed at a speed higherthan 12 mph 

Automatic System Activation 

Initially, the Rear-view camera system is ready to send data after 
engaging reverse gear (identification by CAN messages) and then 
sends an enquiry to the CCC. In response, the CCC gives the 
authorization to output the video signal. The rear-view camera 
video signal is output only after receiving this authorization. 

A corresponding error message is sent in the form of a CC mes¬ 
sage in the event of the Rear-view camera system not being avail¬ 
able. 


System Deactivation 

Automatic or Indirect System Activation. 

The rear-view camera is deactivated automatically in response 
to the following conditions: 

• After exceeding a certain preset speed Vmax- forward 
(about 12mph) as well as 

• A preset distance (about 50m) when driving in forward 
direction. 

Deactivation by Vehicle User 

Deactivation by vehicle user (while image from the rear-view 
camera is shown on the CID) by: 

• Operating iDrive (pop-up menu) 

• Pressing the PDC button 

The rear-view camera is activated again when reverse gear is 
engaged. 

Permanent System Deactivation 

The rear-view camera can be permanently deactivated in the 
settings menu. 




Rear-View Camera Design 


The rear-view camera is based on a CMOS sensor 
(Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor sensor) adapted for 
use in the vehicle with an integrated image processing unit for full- 
digital processing of the raw sensor data (up to 110 Mbits/s). The 
electronic circuitry is designed as a two-processor system. The 
image processing takes place in the electronic module. The follow¬ 
ing processing steps are executed: 

• Histogram control - brightness and color adaptation to various 
exposure scenarios 

• Image equalization - compensation of lens effects 

• Superimposition of driver assistance line and camera pan 

• Calibration functions 

The tasks of bus communication, flash and boot routines and other 
standard applications are implemented in a separate microproces¬ 
sor. 

The lens with the 2.0 shutter is made up of 6 glass lenses. 

It contains an automatically controlled heating element to de-ice 
the lens in winter. The heating element is largely controlled infinite¬ 
ly variable with a PWM control.

Anti-Theft Alarm System 


The anti-theft alarm system (DWA) is available as standard equip¬ 
ment. The task of the anti-theft alarm system is to indicate unau¬ 
thorized access to the vehicle by emitting an alarm. The alarm can 
be triggered both audibly and visually. To do this, however, the 
alarm system must be armed. When activated, the alarm monitors 
the entire vehicle interior. 

In addition, the alarm system monitors the engine compartment 
and the vehicle's rest position. In order that nothing can be stolen 
from the luggage compartment, the alarm system monitors the 
tailgate. 

The alarm also indicates if the vehicle has been tampered with like 
cutting the feed line to the emergency siren. 

The anti-theft alarm system is based on the E90. However, the 
alarm system's ultrasonic passenger-compartment sensor is 
located fully in the rooffunction center. 

The ultrasonic signal passes into the inside of vehicle through 
openings in the grill of the rooffunction center. The emergency 
power siren with tilt alarm sensor is located near the front wheel 
arch. 


UItrasonic PassengerCompartment Protection 

The ultrasonic passenger-compartment sensor captures and eval¬ 
uates movements in the vehicle interior. Initialization of the ultra¬ 
sonic passenger-compartment sensor is started 3 s after closing 
the engine bonnet, tailgate and the last door. 

The ultrasonic passenger-compartment sensor is operational 20 s 
afterthe start of initialization and is included in the vehicle moni¬ 
toring system. The ultrasonic passenger compartment sensor has 
been integrated into the rooffunction center.The rooffunction 
center is connected to the K-CAN and DWA bus.
