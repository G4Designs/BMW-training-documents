Audio Systems 


The US vehicles are equipped with the new head unit platform 
called CHAM P (Central Head unit and M ultimedia Platform)The 
CCC (Car Communication Computer) is available as the head unit 
forthe Professional navigation system. The head units offer eight 
favorites buttons. 

Professional Radio (CHAMP) 

The CHAM P and CCC have eightfavorite buttons, six assignable 
favorites buttons. Button 7 is assigned with FM/AM selection, but¬ 
ton 8 is fortoggling the operating mode. 

CHAM P combines the following control modules in the one housing: 

• RDS double tuner 

• Audio system controller 

• Gateway between MOST and K-CAN 

• Interface to the Central Information Display. 

CHAM P system can be used to control: 

• Communication 

• Entertainment 

• Air conditioning (climate control) 



Professional Radio with NAV (CCC) 

Note: Button 7 is assigned with FM/AM selection, 
button 8 is fortoggling the operating mode 

The CCC combines the following control modules in one housing: 

• Navigation computer/GPS module; map view and/or cursor 
view in the CID 

• RDS double tuner 

• Audio system controller 

• Gateway between MOST and K-CAN 

• Interface to control display (LVDS). 

Two drives are integrated in the housing: 

• DVD player 

• CD player 










When the navigation system is not in use, its DVD drive can be 
used to play audio CDs.The playback of video files is not support¬ 
ed.! he system can be used to control: 

• Communication 

• Entertainment 

• Navigation 

• Air conditioning (climate control) 

• Settings (5th menu).The MP3 directory structure corresponds 
to that of a PC. There is no limit to the number of directories, 
sub-directories and music tracks that the CCC can support. 
However, the time taken for the drive to read the contents of 
the CD when the CD is inserted is longer, depending on how 
much data is stored on the CD. 

Amplifiers and Speakers 

The speaker systems in the E70 are, as in other Series, available in 
two quality levels: 

• HiFi system 

• Top-HiFi system. 


Even though the diameters of the speakers in the HiFi and Top- 
H iF i systems are the same, there are differences in the power out¬ 
put of the speakers. This is achieved through the use of different 
materials in the diaphragms, coils and magnets. 

The HiFi system achieves double the power of the standard stereo 
system. In addition, the HiFi system is equipped with a 7-channel 
amplifier with digital equalizer. 

The optional Top-HiFi system achieves double the powerofthe 
standard HiFi system and uses a digital 9-channel amplifier. 
Optimum audio playback in the vehicle is achieved thanks to com¬ 
plex digital signal processing. 

The HiFi system has twelve speakers, five tweeters, five mid-range 
and two central bass speakers. The HiFi amplifier is woken by the 
Rad_On signal sent by hard wire from the Head unit and uses a 
K-C AN connection for diagnostics and coding. 

TheTop-HiFi system has 16 speakers, seven tweeters, seven mid¬ 
range speakers and two central bass speakers.TheTop-HiFi ampli¬ 
fier is connected to the M 0ST. 

The central bass speakers are located underthe front seats. They 
are coupled to the side sills to increase the resonance volume nec¬ 
essary for bass reproduction. 

The CHAM P and the CCC (navigation system) can be combined 
with any ofthe amplifier/speaker systems, provided the specific 
national variants are taken into consideration. 

Note: CHAMP receives the terminal 58g (lighting) signal 
via hard wire.The CCC receives it via the K-CAN.

CD Changer 

The new 6-disc CD changer (CDC) is available forthe E70.The 
first time that a single-slot CD changer has been fitted in a BMW 
vehicle. It is manufactured by Alpine. The CD changer is located 
behind the glove box and it is integrated on the M OST network. 

Single-slot CD changer means that the CDs are loaded individually 
into the device without a magazine. A CD can be loaded by press¬ 
ing the load button, followed by the button forthe operating tray of 
the CD to be inserted. If no button is pressed afterthe load button 
has been tapped, the LED in the operating tray button assigned to 
the first free tray flashes. In the meantime, the tray moves into posi¬ 
tion. 

When the tray is in the correct position, the status display begins to 
flash and the CD can be loaded. The contents of the CD are read 
as soon as the CD is inserted. The next CD cannot be inserted 
until the contents of this CD have been read. The rapid loading fea¬ 
ture must be activated to be able to insert all CDs immediately one 
afterthe other. To do this, the load button must be pressed for 
approximately 2 seconds. The LEDs in the operating buttons 
assigned to free trays begin to flash. Up to 6 CDs can be inserted 
one afterthe other, depending on the number of trays free. The 
contents of the CDs inserted are read either once the final free tray 
has been filled, on expiry of a time out or if the load or eject button 
is pressed. An individual CD can be ejected by pressing the eject 
button followed by the operating button concerned. Pressing and 
holding the eject button ejects all the CDs. 

The CDs cannot be loaded unless the shutter is open. The status 
display flashes when it is possible to insert a disc. Operation is 
described in detail in the Owner's Handbook forthe vehicle. 


CD Changer Location 


Note: If the eject button is no longer working, a CD can 
be ejected using the diagnostic tester. If the C D is 
mechanically jammed in the drive, it is necessary to 
send in the CD changer. 





The CD changersupports the following compressed file formats: 

• MPEG-1 Layer3 Audio (MP3) with ID3 tag version 1 and ver¬ 
sion 2 

• Windows M edia Audio (WM A) with WM A tags 

• Advanced Audio Coding (AAC). 

The data on the CD is decoded by the CD changer and converted 
into the digital MOST format. 

With the HiFi System, the digital data on the CD is sent to the head 
unit via the M OST, where it is then converted to analogue data and 
output via the amplifier and the speakers. 

If the Top-HiFi system is installed, the decoded audio data is sent 
directly to theTop- HiFi amplifier via the MOST from where it is 
output.This direct transmission bypassing the head unit is made 
possible because data conversion and sound adjustment take 
place exclusively in the Top-HiFi amplifier. 

Retrofitting a C D C hanger 

The fiber optics conductors forconnecting the CD changer are 
arranged at the fiber optics connector in the luggage compartment 
such that they are not incorporated in the MOST ring. After retro¬ 
fitting a CD changer, the fiber optics conductors forthe CD chang¬ 
er preparation are unplugged at the fiber optics connector and con¬ 
nected to the MOST ring. It is then necessary to code the entire 
vehicle. 


Note: For more information referto the technical training 
material on available onTIS.

• GPS antennal 

• SDARS satellite reception antenna. 



16 

E70 Audio Systems Workbook 


The SDARS system uses three satellites which follow an elliptical 
orbit around the Earth. Because of the arrangement of the orbits, 
there are always two satellites over the reception area.In areas with¬ 
out coverage, the SDARS signals are beamed terrestrially. Both 
SDARS signals (satellite and terrestrial) are received by an antenna 
patch in the roof antenna and made available to the SDARS control 
module. 

Note: The antenna inputto SDARS uses only one connec¬ 
tion forthe Satellite and the Terrestrial antenna.

Rear Seat Entertainment (RS E) 



A rear entertainment system" Rear DVD system" is offered as an 
option in the new BMW X5 (E70).The system consists of the fol¬ 
lowing components: 


• Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE) control module 

• 8" color monitor with folding mechanism and infrared 
transmitter 


• Headphone connection 

• Remote control. 


The "DVD system in the rear" offers the following functions: 


The rear seat entertainment is functionally independent of the 
other entertainment sources available in the vehicle. Via the iDrive, 
the driver orfront passenger can release or lock the rear seat enter¬ 
tainment in the "Settings" menu. The rear seat entertainment pro¬ 
gram cannot be controlled by iDrive. 

Once the rear seat entertainment system is activated, the rear-seat 
passengers can be entertained by the rear display and headphones 
or audio speakers in the vehicle. If headphones are used, a different 
medium can be enjoyed via the rear seat entertainment system, 
independently from the vehicle audio system. The rear seat enter¬ 
tainment display or headphones can be controlled by a remote 
control. The settings made are displayed in the rear display. No 
visual status signal display is issued forvolume navigation.

Initializing the Remote Control 

There is a test plan forteaching-in the remote control in the diag¬ 
nostics under "Rear S eat E ntertainment." 

The test plan works through the following steps: 

• The entry of the current detected remote control forthe rear 
seat entertainment is deleted in CAS3. 



• The remote control forthe rear seat entertainment is initial¬ 
ized. 

• Successful initialization of the remote control is acknowledged 
bythe automatic closing and opening ofthe central locking. 

Note: Remote controls are not interchangeable. Only the 
initialized remote control is functional in the vehicle.

E70 Audio 


Note: Audio is played back either through the audio speak¬ 
ers in the vehicle or via the headphones. The road 
speed dependent volume control will only affectthe 
audio playbackthrough the speakers and notthe 
headphones 

The commands entered using the remote control of the rear seat 
entertainment are transferred via the transmission frequency, which 
is also used forthe radio remote control key function. 

The frequency used is dependent on the national variant and there¬ 
fore relevant for coding, and therefore relevant for coding. 

The commands are received by the FBD aerial and routed via the 
antenna amplifier with diversity module to the CAS3.The CAS3 
converts the signals into K-CAN messages. The commands then 
reach the RSE control module via the K-CAN. 

If audio is played back via the audio speakers in the vehicle, the 
audio signal is routed from the RSE control module via the 
AUX_NF cables and via the audio socket to the radio or navigation 
system AuxJn.The audio socket is standard equipment in the E70 
and fitted underthe center armrest. The connection to the RSE 
control module is disconnected manually by connection of an 
external item of equipment to the audio socket. 

Other external items of equipment can be connected via the AV 
input to the RSE control module. 

The programming, coding and diagnostics forthe rear seat enter¬ 
tainment are performed via the K-CAN. The terminal status is also 
transferred as a K-CAN message. 

The wheel speed signals are routed from the DSC control module 
to the PT-CAN and converted in the J unction-box ECU (j B) to the 
K-CAN protocol. The instrument cluster processes the road-speed 
signal and makes it available on the K-CAN. 


Workbook 


Navigation Systems 

Map navigation (Professional navigation system) based on the Car 
Communication Computer (CCC) is provided in the E70.The func¬ 
tions correspond with the areas already known in the E60, E61, 
E63, E64, E90, E91 and E92. 

Via the voice input, the CCC supports the entry of whole words for 
a country, town and street. It is still also possible to spell the desti¬ 
nation. 

Forthe market launch of the E70 in the USA, the (RTTI) traffic 
warning system (Real Time Traffic Information) is provided. The 
service is controlled by the "Traffic information for navigation"option 
and is currently included in the range offunctions of the 
"Professional navigation system" option. 

RTTI is transferred in the form of a data stream from particular FM 
stations. The data is received from the CCC FM tuner, evaluated 
and made available forthe navigation system. In the navigation 
map, traffic issues are indicated by symbols. The traffic issues are 
also available in a list. The list entries are then sorted by the current 
distance between the vehicle and the traffic issue. If the traffic issue 
is on the current route, there is a voice output.
