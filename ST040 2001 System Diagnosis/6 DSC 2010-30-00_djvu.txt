Control Unit/Hydraulic Unit 


The M K60 control unit/hydraulic unit is located 
in the engine compartment on the left side 
under the brake master cylinder. 

Both the control unit and the hydraulic unit are 
replaceable as separate components. 


The pre-charge pump used on previous 
systems is no longer required. Rapid pressure 
build up is possible because of the close 
proximity of the hydraulic unit to the master 
cylinderand improvements in the design of the 
return pump. 

The control unit/hydraulic unit itself is 20% 
smaller and lighter than the previous M K20 El. 

All processing functions for AB5, ASC or DSC are performed by the combined control 
unit/hydraulic unit. The M K 60 control unit is also responsible for processing the wheel 
speed signals and providing them to other control units. 

The M K60 control unit for MY 2002 incorporates the RDW function into its scope of 
control, making a separate RDW control unit unnecessary. The operating principle 
continues to be based on the analysis of wheel speed.

The hydraulic unit consists of an aluminum block containing 12 solenoid valves, 2 pressure 
accumulators and the return pump. 

4 inlet solenoid valves (N/0) 2 changeover solenoid valves (N/0) 

4 outlet solenoid valves (N/C) 2 Intake solenoid valves (N/C) 

The solenoid valving ensures that normal braking is possible in the event of a defective 
control unit. 

In AB5 regulation the pump returns fluid back to the master cylinder circuits. In A5C/DSC 
regulation with brake intervention, the pump is responsible for building up the brake 
pressure required for the front and rear hydraulic circuits.

CAN Interface 

The MK60 is connected to the CAN bus for communication with the AGS, DME control 
module, Steering Angle Sensor and the Instrument Cluster. 

The CAN bus allows all of the connected control modules to send and receive information 
and commands. 

Communication with the M K60 includes: 


DME - The DME sends current engine torgue. M K60 commands the DME to reduce 
(ASC/DSC) or raise (M SR) engine torgue. 

AGS - The M K60 commands the AGS to suppress shifts during regulation. 

LEW - The M K60 receives steering angle information. 

KOMBI - The M K60 commands the instrument cluster to activate or deactivate the 
warning lamps. 

All four wheels speed signals are sent over the CAN bus for use by other modules.

Tandem Master Brake Cylinder 



The M K60 system uses a tandem master brake 
cylinder fitted with central valves as in other DSC 
master cylinders. The central valves allow fluid 
to be drawn through the master cylinder during 
ASC and DSC regulation. The hydraulic circuit is 
divided front/rear. 

An inlet for pre-charge pressure is no longer 
used since the charge pump has been 
eliminated from the M K60. 

Both brake pressure sensors are mounted on 
the master cylinder. 


Expansion Tank and Brake Fluid Level Switch 


The brake fluid expansion tank 
has internal baffles that reduce 
foaming during return pump 
operation. 

The expansion tank includes a 
pick-up tube for clutch master 
cylinder fluid supply. 

The brake fluid level switch is 
incorporated into the cap. The 
switch is a reed contact switch. 
If the brake fluid is at a sufficient 
level, the switch is closed and 
switched to ground. 



If the fluid level drops below a specified level , the reed contacts open and the M K 60 
responds by switching off the A5C/DSC functions.

Teves DSC III M K60 


Normal braking and ABS operation is unaffected 




Brake Pressure Sensors 


Two brake pressure sensors are mounted on the master cylinder below the outlet ports for 
the front and rear brake circuits. The sensors are provided a 5V reference voltage by the 
M K 60 control unit. 

The sensor provides the control unit with an analog signal proportional to brake pressure. 
Voltage increases with increasing brake pressure. 

Plausibility with BLS 

The signal input from the brake 
light switch is compared with the 
pressure sensor values. 

The pressure sensors must not 
detect more that 5 bar when the 
BLS is not actuated. 

Both signals are used to form a 
redundant BLS input which is 
constantly monitored. 



Note: Refer to the Workshop Hints for instructions on initializing the brake pressure sensors. 
Brake Light Switch (BLS) 

The brake switch is an input to the M K 60 to inform it that the brakes are being applied. If 
the signal is received during an ASC regulation then brake regulation is interrupted.

Wheel Speed Sensors (active) 


With the introduction of the Teves DSC III M K60, active wheel speed sensors that operate 
on the principle of magnetoresistive effect are used for the first time on B M W vehicles. 

The sensor element and evaluation module are two separate components within the 
sensor housing.

Principle of operation of the magnetoresistive sensor 

The active sensing of the magnetoresistive sensor is particularly suitable for advanced 
stability control applications in which sensing at zero or near zero speed is required. 

A permanent magnet in the sensor produces a magnetic field with the magnetic field stream 
at a right angle to the sensing element. 

The sensor element is a ferromagnetic alloy that changes its resistance based on the 
influence of magnetic fields. 


11 

Teves DSC III M K60 






As the high portion of the pulse wheel approaches the sensing element, a deflection of the 
magnetic field stream is created. This causes the resistance to change in the thin film 
ferromagnetic layer of the sensor element. 





1. Metal pulse wheel 

2. Magnet 

3. Sensor element 

4. Evaluation circuit 

5. Magnetic field 


The sensor element is affected by the direction of the magnetic field, not the field strength. 
The field strength is not important as long as it is above a certain level. This allows the 
sensor to tolerate variations in the field strength caused by age, temperature or 
mechanical tolerances. 

The resistance change in the sensor element affects the voltage that is supplied by the 
evaluation circuit. The small amount of voltage provided to the sensor element is monitored 
and the voltage changes (1 to lOOmV) are converted into current pulses by the evaluation 
module.

The sensorevaluation circuit is supplied 12V by the M K60 control unit. Output voltage from 
the sensor is approximately 10V. The control unit counts the high and low current pulses 
to determine the wheel speed signal. 

Front sensors are three wire because they have a separate ground wire. 

Rear sensors are two wire and use the sensor case as a ground point. 

12 

Teves DSC III M K60 






Different sensors are used on the left and right side 
front axle of the vehicle. The difference comes in the 
length of the harness. 

The connectors are blue to distinguish them apart 
from the grey connectors used for sensors on the 
MK20EI. 

The DSC III MK60 uses the same metal pulse 
wheels used with the M K20 inductive sensors. 



Front axle E46/Z3 


Rear axle Z3 



Rear axle E46, short 



There are two types of sensors used in the rear axle of the E46: 

The short sensor is used on the 325i (any transmission) and 330i automatic 
The long sensor is used on the 330i manual transmission version. 

The Z3 uses the same sensors for the rear axle, left or right. 


13 

Teves DSC 111 M K60 



Rotation Rate Sensor 


The Rotation Rate Sensor is mounted on a metal bracket under the drivers seat. The 
sensor provides information to the M K60 concerning the vehicles speed around its main 
axis (yaw). 

The sensor has a three pin connector with the following connections: 

5V reference 

Signal 

Ground 

The sensor receives a reference voltage of 5V from the M K60 control unit and provides a 
signal output of approximately 0.25 to 4.65V depending on the amount and direction of 
yaw. If the sensor is defective a constant voltage will be sent to the M K60. 

The sensor element is a micro-mechanical double quartz tuning fork. A frequency of 11 
Hertz is applied to one side of the fork and as the vehicle turns on it's axis, vibrations are 
induced on the other end. 

The sensor analyzes the signal produced by the fork and produces an analog voltage 
signal that is proportional to the amount of yaw. 

The rotation (yaw) rate is compared to the signal from the Steering Angle Sensor and the 
Transverse Acceleration Sensor. If physical limits are beginning to be exceeded, the M K60 
DSC will begin regulation by engine and brake intervention to attempt to stabilize the 
vehicle. This is referred to as a GMR regulation. 



The MK60 DSC III for M ,Y. 2002 incorporates a combined Rotation rate and Transverse 
Acceleration Sensor. The Sensor is connected to the M K60 control unit by the CAN bus. 
The Z3 version will retain separate sensors until the E36/7 is replaced by the E46/6. 


14 

Teves DSC III M K60 


Steering Angle Sensor (LEW) 

The Steering Angle Sensor is mounted towards the lower end of the steering column, 
above the flexible coupling. The LEW consists of a potentiometer and a built in 
microprocessor. The potentiometer has two pickups offset at 90° to one another. The raw 
potentiometersignal is processed and converted into a digital signal that is transmitted over 
the CAN bus to the M K60 DSC III control unit. 



The sensor requires initialization in order to create a zero point default. Once initialized the 
LEW sends an ID number to the DSC control unit. The ID provides confirmation that the 
LEW is properly initialized. 

The total steering wheel angle is determined by combining the CAN telegram signal, the 
stored zero point default and the actual number of turns to the wheel. In order to prevent 
the LEW from loosing count, KL 30 is provided to the sensor and it continues to record 
even after the ignition has been switched off. 

The M K60 DSC III calculates the drivers desired rate of turn from the steering angle signal.

Teves DSC 111 M K60 



Transverse (Lateral) Acceleration Sensor 


The Transverse Acceleration Sensor is 
mounted in the left "A" pillar behind the driver's 
foot rest. The sensor provides the M K60 DSC 
control unit with a signal that corresponds to 
the degree of transverse acceleration (G forces) 
acting on the vehicle. 

The sensor is a capacitive sensor with two 
plates. One plate is rigidly mounted, the other 
plate is mounted on a spring. Under the effect 
of transverse forces acting on the sensor the 
distance between the plates changes. 



This change of distance between the plates affects the capacitance of the sensor. The 
evaluation circuitry converts the signal into an analog voltage that is transmitted to the 
control unit. 


The output signal of the sensor is between the range of 0.5 to 4.5 Volts. This corresponds 
to -1.5 to 3.5g respectively. When the vehicle is stationary the output is 1.8V. 

The transverse acceleration signal is used in the M K60 DSC III control unit along with the 
rotation rate and steering angle signal to determine if DSC regulation is required to maintain 
the vehicles stability. 

Note: Refer to Workshop Hints for instructions on initializing sensor.

DSC Button 


The DSC button is located on the SZM, however the SZM provides no processing, it is 
simply a housing for the button which is hardwired to the M K60 control unit. 

The DSC Button features two functions that can be set by varying the time the button is 
held down for: 


Button activation

purpose of improving traction in slippery 
conditions. ASC uses different thresholds.

Pressing the button again returns the system to normal status. It is not possible to go 
directly from one function to the next without first returning to normal status.

Teves DSC 111 M K60 

















Instrument Cluster Warning Indicators 



Three warning indicator lamps are arranged in the instrument cluster: 

DSC lamp: Indicates fault in DSC or system disabled by the switch. 

ABS lamp: Indicates a fault in the ABS system. 

ABL"BRAKE" lamp: This lamp is a general brake warning and illuminates two different 
colors. 

Red indicates low brake fluid or hand brake engaged. 

Yellow indicates DSC/ABS fault orsystem disabled by the switch. 

The DSC and yellow ABL lamp are controlled by the M K60 DSC III control unit via the CAN 
bus. The ABS lamp is controlled directly by the M K60 via hardwire. 


Hand brake Switch 

The hand brake switch is an input to the M K60 DSC to cancel MSR regulation 


18 

Teves DSC III MK60 









Principle of Operation 

The scope of control for the M K60 DSC III is comprised of three systems 

ABS 

ASC+T 

DSC 


Based on signals coming from the various sensors, the M K60 DSC III will determine which 
system is best suited to maintain control of the vehicle. 

In addition to the three basic systems, there are several sub-functions which are activated 
during very specific circumstances. The sub-functions are: 


CBC 
EBV 
M SR 
ADB 
DBC 
MBC 



MBC- DSC- DBC 


ADB 

MSR 


System: Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) 

The ABS system can prevent wheel lock when braking by comparing the four active wheel 
speed sensors to the average vehicle speed. If a wheel is locking during braking or has 
dropped below a speed threshold programmed in the control unit ABS braking will begin. 
ABS braking is possible when vehicle speeds are above 12 kph (7mph). 

ABS regulation has three phases: 

Pressure Build 
Pressure Hold 
Pressure Release 


19 

Teves DSC 111 M K60 


Pressure Build already occurs during normal braking, so when AB5 first intervenes it will 
start holding pressure by energizing the Inlet Valve. For example, if the right rear wheel is 
locking up, both Inlet Valves will be energized, regulating both wheels together. This logic 
is known as Select Low. Front wheels can be regulated individually as needed to prevent 
lockup. 


Energizing the Inlet Valve closes the brake fluid passage to the calipers and traps the fluid 
at the current pressure, thus not allowing the brake pressure to rise any further. 


If the wheel speed does not increase the Pressure Release phase begins

Pressure Release occurs when the control unit energizes the Outlet Valve while continuing 
to hold the Inlet Valve closed. The trapped brake fluid is released out of the calipers, 
reducing braking pressure. 


At the same time, the pump is switched on which draws in the released brake fluid and 
pumps it back into the pressure-build circuit restoring the volume of brake fluid again in 
front of the Inlet valve. 


Depending on conditions the AB5 system may cycle between these three phases from 3 
to 12 times a second to prevent wheel lock. 

20 

Teves DSC III MK 60 





ABS Sub-functions 


Comer Brake Control (CBC) 

CBC can occur if the vehicle is cornering and ABS regulation is not taking place. 

If the control unit detects transverse acceleration in excess of 0.6g and the brakes are 
applied, CBC prevents a build up in brake pressure to the inside rear wheel. This prevents 
the vehicle from entering into an unstable situation that can lead to Oversteer. 

The M K60 accomplishes this by closing the Inlet Valve, thus not allowing brake pressure to 
increase at the brake caliper. 


The difference in braking force between the two rear wheels creates a yaw force that 
opposes the oversteer and allows the vehicle to handle neutrally. 






Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBV) 

EB V will adjust brake pressure to the rear axle based on the rate of slow-down of the rear 
wheels, ensuring even brake force between the front and the rear of the vehicle. 

The control unit monitors the wheel speed when the brakes are applied and compares the 
deceleration of the front and rear axle to determine required regulation. 

If the vehicle is moderately to fully loaded, the rear axle will take longer to slow down, rear 
wheel brakes can then be applied at a higher pressure . 

If a vehicle was lightly loaded, a similar brake pressure would be too great and result in an 
unstable situation. 

If EBV control intervention is required, the control unit cycles the inlet valve on the rear brake 
calipers to prevent further build-up. 

Benefits of EBV are: 

Enhanced braking due to even distribution of brake force. 

Rear wheel brake size can be increased. 

Front and rear brakes wear at a similar rate. 


22 

Teves DSC III M K60 



Automatic Stability Control (ASC+T) 

Based on input from the wheel speed sensors, the M K60 control unit determines if the 
vehicle is loosing traction due to excessive longitudinal (straight line) wheel slip. An A5C 
regulating sequence is initiated if the wheel slip exceeds the control units stored allowable 
values. 




A critical slip ratio of up to 5% between the wheels will cause the traction control regulation 
to begin. This slip ratio is established when the system detects a wheel spin difference of 
2M PH or greater. 

A5C regulation is cancelled at any time if the brake pedal is applied. 


23 

Teves DSC 111 M K60 
























The M K60 can control longitudinal wheel slip by two means: 

Engine Intervention 

Brake Intervention (adb, drive wheels only) 

Engine Intervention 

Engine torque may be reduced by: 

Reducing the throttle opening angle 
Retarding the ignition 

Canceling individual cylinders by fuel injection cutout. 

The M K60 DSC III control unit determines the amount of torque reduction that is 
necessary and sends the request for regulation to the DM E via the CAN bus. 

Brake Intervention (ADB) 

Brake intervention is applied to the individual drive wheel which is loosing traction by 
regulating the brake calipers in three phases: 

Pressure Build 
Pressure Hold 
Pressure Release 

When brake intervention is necessary, the front wheels must be isolated from the Pressure 
Build sequence in the hydraulic unit. 

Here is an example of an A5C brake intervention at the left rear wheel: 

The Changeover Valve forthe rearbrake circuit, the right rearand both front Inlet Valves 
are energized and closed. 

The rear brake circuit Intake Valve is energized and opened. 

The Return/Pres sure pump is activated and draws brake fluid through the open Intake 
Valve from the Master Cylinder (via the Central Valve) and delivers the pressurized fluid to 
the open Inlet Valve braking the left rear wheel. 

Pressure Hold and Pressure Release are done by cycling the Inlet and Outlet Valves 
similar to the AB5 sequence described previously. 

The control unit decides which regulation method should take place based on input 
criteria and chooses from two regulating principles: 

Select-High 

Select-Low 


24 

Teves DSC III M K60 



Select-High Regulation 

In a Select-High regulation, the M K60 control unit selects the drive wheel with the highest 
amount of traction and uses it as the basis for evaluation. 


Engine torque is reduced slightly by request to the DM E. 

The wheel with the least amount of traction is braked. This allows a torque transfer to 
the wheel with the higher amount of traction (similar to a locking differential). 

Select-High is used if the vehicle speed is below 40 kph (25 mph). 

Select-Low Regulation 

In a Select-Low regulation, the M K60 control unit selects the drive wheel with the lowest 
amount of traction and uses it as the basis for evaluation. 

Engine torque is reduced until the wheel slip is no longer present. 

Brake regulation is not carried out. 

Select-Low is used if the vehicle speed is above 40 kph (25 mph). 

ASC Sub-functions 

Engine Drag Torque Reduction (MSR) 

If the vehicle is driven in low gear when coasting down hill, or if there is a sudden shift to a 
lower gear, the wheels may be slowed by the engine's braking effect too rapidly. This could 
result in an unstable situation. 

If the front wheels are turning faster than the rear wheels, the M K 60 control unit signals the 
DM E via the CAN bus to raise the engine torque. DM E cancels fuel cut-off and allows the 
engine speed to increase, this allows the drive wheels to accelerate to match the speed of 
the non-driven wheels. 

MSR regulation is cancelled if the brake pedal or hand brake are applied. 


25 

Teves DSC 111 M K60 



Modified ADB function (2-wheel drive vehicles equipped with MK60) 

The ADB is an automatic differential lock that improves traction. The slipping wheel is 
braked by pressure built up in the hydraulic unit. The drive torque can be transferred to the 
wheel with the greater traction, which can transmit drive power to the road. This function 
takes the place of a limited slip differential. 

The M K60 DSC III system incorporates two methods of ADB based on the DSC switch 
input to the control unit. With the system "on" the ADB works with engine intervention at 
a threshold of below 40kph(24 mph). 

Tapping the DSC switch (<2.5 s) increases the slip threshold of the ADB up to 
approximately 70 kph (42 mph) for the purpose of increasing traction. 

This feature is also helpful for example when rocking a vehicle out of mud or snow.

Coefficient of friction 









Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 


With the introduction of DSC systems, lateral dynamics were taken into account for the first 
time. The MK60 DSC III system will initiate a DSC regulation sequence if the control unit 
detects a difference between the drivers desired turning angle and the actual rotation angle 
of the vehicle. The control unit determines vehicle stability based on: 

Steering wheel angle 
Wheel speed 

Transverse acceleration forces 
Rotation angle and speed (yaw) 

Once the control unit determines that the vehicle is in an unstable situation, it also 
identifies whether it is oversteering or understeering. This distinction is important because 
it determines which control strategy should be used to help stabilize the vehicle. 

DSC regulation consist of: 

Engine intervention 

Engine and brake intervention (any wheel) 

Brake intervention 


rear wheel. 



27 

Teves DSC 111 M K60 


Understeer Detected: 

• Engine Torque Reduction 

• Brake applied to inside 







Understeer 

Understeer occurs when the driver wishes to turn a corner but despite the front wheels 
being turned in the direction of the curve the vehicle continues its track forward. This 
occurs when the front wheels no longer have sufficient lateral locating force (traction). 

The M K60 DSC III can identify the situation and initiate a corrective action based on engine 
torque reduction followed by a controlled brake intervention sequence if needed. 

Engine torque reduction is carried out by the DM E from a request by the DSC via the CAN 
bus. The DM E telegrams the torque reduction confirmation back to the DSC. 

Brake intervention is carried out by the M K60 hydraulic unit if the driver is not actively 
braking. An example of a brake intervention at the inside rear wheel is as follows: 

All Inlet Valves are closed except for the right rear inlet. 

Intake Valve for rear circuit is opened. 

Both Changeover Valves are closed. 

Return pump operated.

Oversteer 

Oversteer occurs when the driver wishes to turn a corner and the tail of the vehicle slides 
outward leading the turn. This is caused by the reartires loosing traction and not being able 
to hold against the centrifugal force acting upon the vehicle. 

The M K60 DSC III can identify the situation and initiate a corrective action based on engine 
torque reduction followed by a controlled brake intervention sequence if needed. 

Engine torque reduction is carried out by the DM E from a request by the DSC via the CAN 
bus. The DM E sends the torque reduction confirmation back to the DSC.

WITH DSC III 


OVERSTEER CORRECTION 


1. VEHICLE APPROACES TURN AT HIGH RATE OF SPEED: 
- Driver steers into turn and applies brakes to slow down. 



2D. The torque reduction and rear brake regulation 
should stabilize the vehicle at this point. If not 
the left front wheel has a high degree of lateral 
locating force and is momentarily regulated. 

This action deliberately causes the wheel to shed 
a calculated degree of it's locating force This 
counteracts oversteer yaw at this wheel and also 
aids in slowing the vehicle down to correct it. 


2B. Driver tries to compensate by oversteering which 
diminishes lateral locating force even further. 
Simultaneously, rear of car starts to slide out. 

2C. DSC III determines an OVERSTEER condition. 
Engine torque is reduced via CAN Bus signalling. 
Outside rear wheel is momentarily regulated to 
counteract severe yaw angle (also helps to reduce 
drive torque further.)

Brake intervention is carried out by the M K60 hydraulic unit if the driver is not actively 
braking. An example of a brake intervention at the left outside wheel is as follows: 


All Inlet Valves are closed except for the left rear inlet 
Intake Valve for rear circuit is opened. 

Both Changeover Valves are closed. 

Return pump operated.

DSC Sub-functions 


Dynamic Brake System (DBS) 

DBS is designed to assist the driver in emergency braking situations by automatically 
increasing pressure to the vehicles brake system. This allows the vehicle to stop in the 
shortest distance possible. DBS was first available in 1999 Bosch DSC III 5.7 systems. It 
is available on a Continental Teves system for the first time with M K60 DSC III. 

The DBS system contains two functions: Dynamic Brake Control and Maximum Brake 
Control. DBS functions are programmed into the M K60 control unit and require no addi¬ 
tional hardware over conventional DSC. 

Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) 

The DBC function is designed to provide an increase in braking pressure up to the ABS 
threshold during rapid (emergency) braking situations. The M K60 control unit monitors the 
inputs from the brake light switch and the brake pressure sensors on the master cylinder. 
The triggering criteria for activation of DBC is, how rapidly is the brake pressure increasing 
with an application of the brake pedal. The triggering conditions are: 

Brake light switch on. 

Brake pressure in the master cylinder above threshold. 

Brake pressure build-up speed above threshold. 

Vehicle road speed above 3mph (5kmh). 

Pressure sensor self test completed and sensors not faulted. 

Vehicle traveling forward. 

Not all of the wheels in ABS regulation range. 

If the threshold for DBC triggering is achieved, the M K60 control unit will activate a 
pressure build-up intervention by activating the return pump. The pressure at all wheels is 
increased up to the ABS regulation point. This ensures that the maximum brake force is 
applied to the vehicle. 

During DBC the rear axle is controlled with Select-Low logic and the front wheels are 
regulated individually. DBC will continue until: 

The driver releases the brake pedal. 

Brake pressure falls below threshold. 

Vehicle road speed below 3mph. 

DBC will also be switched off if a fault occurs in with any of the necessary input sensors. 
A fault in DBC will illuminate the "BRAKE" (ABL) lamp yellow to warn the driver, depending 
on the type of failure the DSC lamp may be illuminated as well. 


32 

Teves DSC III M K60 



Maximum Brake Control (MBC) 

The MBC function is designed to support driver initiated braking by building up pressure in 
the rear brake circuit when the front wheels are already in AB5 regulation. 

The additional braking pressure is applied to bring the rear wheels up to the ABS 
regulation point shortening the stopping distance. The MBC function is triggered when the 
brakes are applied more slowly than the threshold needed for a DBC regulation. The trig¬ 
gering conditions are: 

Both front wheels in ABS regulation. 

Vehicle road speed above 3mph (5kmh). 

DBC and pressure sensor initialization test successful. 

Vehicle traveling forward. 

Rear wheels not in ABS regulation. 

If the threshold for M BC triggering is achieved, the M K60 control unit will activate a 
pressure build-up intervention by activating the return pump. The pressure at the rear 
wheels is increased up to the ABS regulation point. This ensures that the maximum brake 
force is applied to the vehicle. 

The MBC function will be switched off if: 

Front wheels drop out of ABS regulation. 

The driver releases the brake pedal. 

Brake pressure falls below threshold. 

Vehicle road speed below 3mph. 

MBC will also be switched off if a fault occurs in with any of the necessary input sensors. 
A fault in M BC will illuminate the "BRAKE" (ABL) lamp yellow to warn the driver, depending 
on the type of failure the DSC lamp may be illuminated as well.

Coding 

Coding must be performed after replacement 
of the M K60 control module or the steering 
angle sensor. ZCS coding is found in the 
Coding and Programming selection from the 
start screen or when pressing the Change 
button. Follow on-screen instructions for 
initialization of components after completing 
the coding process. 


Adjustment Functions 

Adjustment (initialization) is reguired when: 

Replacing the M K60 Control Unit. 

Replacing/Re-coding the Steering Angle Sensor. 

Replacing one or both Brake Pressure Sensors. 

Replacing Lateral Acceleration Sensor. 

Steering Angle Sensor 

The steering angle sensor requires an offset adjustment afterthe sensor has been replaced, 
coded or after repairs to the steering or suspension system. The offset adjustment informs 
the steering angle sensor processor of the straight ahead position of the front wheels. 

The adjustment is performed by completing the Test Module found in Service Functions. 
Once the adjustment is complete the sensor sends an identification number over the CAN 
bus to the DSC control unit. The ID provides confirmation that the steering angle sensor is 
coded and has successfully completed the adjustment procedure.
