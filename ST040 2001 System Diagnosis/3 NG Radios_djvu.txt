NG Radios 




Introduction 


Starting September 2000, a family of new generation radios will begin to be phased into 
production. The exception to this is the E52 which has been available with the MIR (multi- 
information radio) NG radio since series launch in mid 2000. 

The NG "New Generation" radios will have increased functions: 

Radio can be operated without KL R. 

Radios are world frequency. 

Car memory programming. 

Audio mixing on vehicles equipped with navigation. 

The radios external appearance has not changed. NG radios can be identified by their "53" 
designation.

KEY USED 

























































































































Functional Overview 


NG Radios 

Radio Operation with KL R off 

Operation is possible with the key off on the C53 and CD 53 radios. If the radio is turned 
on with KL R off, it will play at the last stored volume and settings for 16 minutes until the 
General Module sends the sleep command. No changes may be made to the radio unless 
KL R is switched back on. The radio can be turned on and off as many times desired. 

Diversity Antenna 

Antenna diversity has been adapted to the new generation of radios. When the radio is in 
operation, the diversity control unit is activated by the "RAD ON" signal. 


World Frequency Radio 

Radios on vehicles sold in the U.S. are world radios. Specific country settings can be made 
using the service mode. The settings are stored in an EEPROM . 


Car Memory 

If programmed, when locking the vehicle using the remote transmitter the: 
last station 
Volume setting 

Last audio mode (Tape, FM, CD etc.) 

are stored according to the key number used. Unlocking the vehicle with the same 
transmitter will restore the settings. There is a maximum setting for volume which may be 
lower than the setting when the radio was last operated. 


Clock 

Time can also be displayed when KL R is off by pressing the clock button on the 
Radio/M ID. 


Backlighting 

The LC M/L5Z produces two signals for the control of radio backlighting. 

Hardwired KL 58g 

Lights on/off over the K/l Bus. 

The radio contains a photo-cell for adjustment of backlighting to ambient conditions.

Reset and Voltage Monitoring 

A radio reset is triggered by under voltage or the internal processor monitor. The reset 
function restarts the radio, similar to turning it off and back on again. Operating voltage is 
measured at the KL 30 input. The radio is switched off if the system voltage exceeds 17V 
to protect the radio, it will switch on when the voltage falls below 16V. 

GAL (Speed Dependent Volume) 

The speed signal from the IKE/KOM Bl is available to the radio overthe K/l Bus. GAL is not 
a feature on vehicles equipped with DSP. 

Bus Communication 

The radio communicates with other modules via the K bus or I Bus dependent on the 
model. The information shared overthe bus line includes: 

IKE/KOMBI - Terminal status (KL 15, KL R) 

LCM/LSZ - Lights on 

IKE/KOMBI link to TXD Diagnosis 
MID or BMBT - button or rotary knob status. 

GM - Key used to lock or unlock vehicle 
MFL - audio controls status 

NG radios do not use anti-theft codes. Operation of the radio is only possible if 
connected to a bus line and the detection of at least one other component. 


Multi Information Radio (MIR) 

The M ulti-lnformation Radio (M IR) is used in the E52 Z8 and is the first of the NG series of 
radios. The M IR contains the radio receiver, display screen, and control panel all in one unit. 
A cassette player is not included. 

The M IR is used to control and display the: 

GPS-Navigation System 

Audio system including CD Changer 

Telephone 

Outside temperature

Every time the M IR is switched on it looks to see if a navigation computer is installed and 
displays the correct menu options. Text and symbols on the display are generated by the 
navigation computer and transmitted to the M IR via the "Navigation” Bus. If the M IR does 
not detect that a navigation computer is connected, the M IR itself will generate it's own dis¬ 
play signals. The screen display is monochrome only. 

The navigation elements of the MIR will be discussed in the MK3 module. 

Audio Mixing 

Audio mixing allows the vehicle passengers to listen to navigation instructions without 
muting the radio or CD player. 

On-Board Computer Functions 

Outside temperature is the only on-board computer display possible for the Z8.

Service Mode for NG Radios 

A service mode is available as on previous radios as a diagnosis tool and forchanging radio 
settings. Entering the service mode varies by the device used to control the radio. 

To enter the service mode: 

C53/CD53 with and without MID: 

Turn on the radio. 

Within 8 seconds, press and hold the "m" button for 8 seconds. 

Scroll through functions using the "+" and keys or the station < > search buttons. 
Turn off the radio to end the service mode. 

C53 MIR: 

Turn on the radio. 

Within 8 seconds, press and hold the "SEL" button for at least 8 seconds. 

Scroll through functions using the station < > search buttons. 

Turn off the radio to end the service mode. 

BM53 with board monitor: 

Turn on the radio. 

Press and hold the "RDS” button for at least 8 seconds. 

Scroll through the functions using the station < > search buttons. 

Turn off the radio to end the service mode. 

BM53 with Widescreen board monitor: 

Turn on the radio. 

Within 8 seconds, press the "INFO” button. 

From the info screen select RDS 

Press and hold the B M control knob for at least 8 seconds. 

Scroll through functions using the station < > search buttons. 

Turn off the radio to end the service mode

Service Mode Functions 


1. Serial Number: Display of the radio serial number. 

2. Software version: Display of the radio software version. Displayed as (calender week, 
year, version) 

3. GAL: Speed-sensitive volume control. Can be adjusted from level 1-6 using the 6 pre¬ 
set audio buttons. Vehicles equipped with DSP do not use this feature. 

4. Field strength and Quality (F/Q): The station currently displayed can be assessed for 
field strength and quality. An "F" (i.e. F15) number is used to indicate the strength of the 
signal being received by the radio. This is a good test of the antenna system, station sig¬ 
nal, and the radio itself. A "Q" (i.e. Q-00) number is used to determine the quality of the 
radio station including both the audio and RDS signal if applicable. 

5. DSP: This function provides information about whether the vehicle is fitted with DSP. 
The value is displayed as a one (fitted) or zero (not fitted) and is communicated by the DSP 
amplifier via the l/K bus. 

6. TP Volume: Provides adjustment for traffic report minimum volume. Not used in the 
US. 

7. AF: Alternative Frequency tracking setting. Not used in the US. 

8. Area: Used to select the appropriate market setting (USA, Canada, Europe, J apan and 
Oceania). Adjust using the pre-set buttons. 

9.lndex: Display of the revision index.
