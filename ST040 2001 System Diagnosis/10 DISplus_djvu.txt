Diagnosis and Information Systems 




System Components 


Monitor 

The DISplus uses a 15” TFT (Thin Film Transistor) 
monitor. It has a pressure sensitive touch screen 
controller to direct the curser movement. 

The monitor is attached to the DISplus by a 15’ 
cable that allows it to be used either on the swivel 
stand or remotely, e.g. inside of a vehicle. 




Main Power Switch 

The main power switch is located in the upper 
right hand side, at the rear of the DISplus. 

The main switch is turned on first, before turning 
the DISplus on from the front panel. The System 
Status LED on the front panel should illuminate 
amber when the main power has been turned on 
(see lower left illustration). 

Circuit breakers are located below the DISplus 
computer. If the unit fails to power-up, check the 
reset of the circuit breakers before calling for 
service.

DVD and 3.5” Floppy Drive 

The DVD and Floppy drives are located behind 
a door on the right side of the unit. 

The Floppy drive is used for the boot-up disk 
when loading the Diagnosis Program. 

The DVD drive is used to load the Basis and 
Program CDs for Diagnosis. 

The TIS CD is also loaded in the DVD drive and 
remains in the drive for the computer to access 
during TIS operation. 


RF Access Point 

The access point is the transfer device 
between the hardwired LAN network and the 
radio frequency assisted LAN. 

The DISplus is connected to the access point 
via a network LAN cable. The access point 
then communicates with the Diagnostic Plead 
using a radio frequency LAN link. 

See Workshop Network Connection (pg. 12) for 
more details concerning networking.

Diagnosis and Information Systems 










Diagnostic Head 


The DISplus uses a Diagnostic 
Head similar to the MoDiC III as 
the communication link between 
the DISplus and the vehicle 
electronics. 

The Head receives operating 
power when the diagnosis cable is 
connected to the vehicle.

Output function to provide a DC power switch 
with circuit protection. It is used for testing cir¬ 
cuits and components. 


Workshop Network Connection 

The DISplus has the ability to be integrated into an existing workshop computer network. 
Networking allows the DISplus to be connected to the same server as the DCS 2000 
system. 

Having all of the BMW centers diagnosis equipment on a network, provides BMW with a 
method of immediate retrieval of data from vehicle systems that are being diagnosed in the 
workshop. 

The benefits are, to provide BMW with a better, more complete and in-depth understand¬ 
ing of diagnostic problems and the conditions of diagnosable systems. Also, this informa¬ 
tion will be used by the Hotline and by Service Engineering to support BMW centers, as 
well as for product improvement and development. 

In addition to reporting, the DISplus will add a web browser feature. This will enable 
technicians to toggle over to the internet and view information on the technical 
website. 



The Workshop Network consists of: 

• DISplus 

• Ethernet drop from the BMW center’s DCS 2000 LAN 

• Switched hub 

• Ethernet Access point with RF transceiver 

• Diagnostic bay(s) wired with 3 Ethernet 10base-T connections 

• Technical Reference PC (located in the workshop) 

• Network Printer: Lexmark M410N post script printer 

• I/P address for each device on the Ethernet

Network Terms Defined 


Ethernet 

Originally developed by Xerox™, Ethernet is the most widely used LAN technology. An 
Ethernet LAN typically uses coaxial cable or twisted pair wiring. The most common 
Ethernet systems are called Wbase -T and provide transmission speeds up to 10Mbps. 


Internet Protocol (I/P) Address 

An Internet Protocol address is a binary number that identifies each sender or receiver of 
information that is sent across the internet or LAN. The I/P address is usually expressed 
as four decimal numbers, each representing eight bits, separated by periods i.e. 
192.168.68.20. The numbers and their sequence provide information to the Network 
about which specific device or Host is sending or receiving a message. 


Local Area Network (LAN) 

A local area network is a group of computers and devices that share a common commu¬ 
nications line and may share the resources of a single server within a small geographic area 
i.e. within a Dealership. Shared programs can be kept on the LAN server and be accessed 
by individuals on the LAN. Also, for example, users can order printing from one centrally 
located printer attached to the LAN. 


lObase-T 

Most Ethernet wiring uses ordinary twisted pair phone line to transfer data within a LAN. 
The designation, lObase-T is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers shorthand. 
“10” refers to the transmission speed of 10Mbps (megabits per second). Base means that 
only Ethernet signals are carried on the line. “T” represents twisted pair. There are other 
media used to transfer Ethernet signals that can use coaxial cable or fiber optical cable.

Diagnosis and Information Systems 



Establishing a Connection With the Diagnostic Head 



Attach the diagnostic cable to the 

head. The cable will only fit in the correct 

socket. 


Note: 

Use the correct cable according to the type of 
diagnosis socket that the vehicle has (16 pin OBD 
II or BMW 20 pin under the hood). 



Connect the diagnostic cable to the 
vehicle. 

Turn on the ignition. 

As a test, all three LEDs will illuminate. 
The green LED should stay illuminated to 
indicate that the head is receiving 
operating power. 

The amber LED will flash until a 
connection to the DISplus can be 
established. 


• As soon as the LAN connection with the DISplus is established, the flashing amber LED 
will change to a steady light. 

• Connection to the Diagnostic Head of the DISplus can be confirmed and created from 
the “Connection Setup” screen of the Administration page. 


15 

Diagnosis and Information Systems 






• If Radio-LAN communication with the 
Diagnostic Head is not possible, a hardwire 
cable connection may be made. 

• Connect the DK LAN cable as shown in the 
illustration (orange connector). 

• On the DISplus, disconnect the SE LAN 
cable (the one connecting the DISplus to the 
network). Connect the other end of the DK 
LAN cable (that looks like a phone 
connector) to the DISplus LAN receptacle. 

• Restart the Head by briefly disconnecting and connecting it to the vehicle to initialize 
communication. 



Connection Setup (Administration) 

When a Diagnostic Head is first introduced to the DISplus or a connection has been lost, 
the LAN link may be established using the Connection Setup screen from the 
Administration menu. To enter the Administration page, select the “Administration” button 
from the main start screen.

Once inside the connection setup 
page there will be a box on the left 
side called “Free diagnostic 
heads” 

Any Fleads that are powered up 
and not currently assigned to a 
DISplus will be found and listed 
in the box. Each head has its own 
I/P address for identification to the 
DISplus. 


• With the correct Diagnostic Plead identified, press the “Connecting” button to establish 
the connection. 

• Once the radio LAN link is established, the DISplus will only be able to communicate 
with that head. If the use of another head is desired, press the “Quit Connecting” 
button from the same page. This breaks the link. Repeat the process for selecting and 
connecting as previously described. 


Checking the Operation LED Indicators of the Access Point 

If communication between the Diagnostic Plead and the DISplus is faulty, the LEDs on the 
access point may help to determine where the problem is. The indicators operate as 
follows:

Once the settings are complete and the test connections are made the oscilloscope graph 
may be viewed by selecting the “Oscilloscope display” button. 

The oscilloscope signal pattern may be adjusted by manipulating the voltage level and the 
trigger level (voltage) from within the display screen. If the displayed pattern is still unread¬ 
able or incorrectly setup, the oscilloscope settings can be further adjusted by returning to 
the settings screen.

Oscilloscope display screen features 

Once the signal pattern is displayed, the pattern may be locked on the screen with the 
“Hold screen” button or with the freeze image buttons on the test cable leads. 

Holding the image will activate the “Cursor”, “Zoom” and “Memory” features. Holding the 
image also allows the signal pattern to be visible when printing the screen. 

Cursor 1 and 2 

This feature is used to measure the amplitude and time differential of the signal pattern. 
Activate the feature by pressing the Cursor 1 button first. A vertical line will appear. 
Roughly position the line by touching the desired measurement point on the screen. 

Anywhere the cursor line intersects the signal pattern, the amplitude value at that point will 
be displayed in a box on the right of the display screen. If both traces of the scope are 
being used, (both channel A and B) each value will be shown in its own box. A fine adjust¬ 
ment may be made to the cursor line by using the arrow buttons to the left and right of the 
cursor buttons. 


The time differential between two points may be measured if cursor 2 is used. Place the 
second cursor at the desired measurement point. The time difference between the two 
cursors will be displayed in the “Time value” box on the right side of the screen.

Zoom 

By selecting the “Zoom” button, a section of the signal pattern may be enlarged to show 
greater detail. The desired section of the display is called up by touching the screen at the 
desired spot. 

Memory 

Memory pages are stored every time the Hold Screen is activated. The DISplus stores the 
last 10 trigger pulses at the time the screen is held. To recall the memory pages, press the 
“Memory” button and use the left arrow button to scroll through the previous 9 pages (page 
10 is already displayed). The cursor and zoom features may be used on the stored pages. 

Preset Measurements 

The preset measurements provide an easy method of testing several commonly measured 
signals. To enter the presets: Press the “Preset measurements” button on the bottom of 
the screen. A pop up window will provide several signals to choose from. Selecting the 
signal and pressing the OK button will automatically configure the oscilloscope to the set¬ 
tings needed to provide the best trace pattern. Many tests also have specialized boxes 
with additional readings( i.e RPM, system voltage). 

For instructions on which cables to use for the preset test, follow the instructions in the 
“Preset measurements” selection of the “Help” menu. 

Since the oscilloscope settings are pre-determined, no changes to the oscilloscope are 
possible.
