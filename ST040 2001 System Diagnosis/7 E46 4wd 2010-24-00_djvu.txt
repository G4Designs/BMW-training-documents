Introduction 


The E46/16 introduces the return of the BMW all-wheel drive carto the United States. This 
time all-wheel drive will be an option (SA 203), available on E46 sedans and Sport Wagons 
beginning 2001M ,Y. 

Vehicles with the all-wheel drive option have been given the engineering designation of 
E46/16. 

One of the significant changes from the previous E30 ix is that the E46/16 does not use a 
viscous coupling or limited slip differential. The all-wheel drive system has largely been 
taken from the X5 concept. It uses two open differentials and a single speed transfer case. 
Power distribution is 38% to the front and 62% to the rear, giving the E46/16 the feel of a 
genuine rear-drive road car. 

With it's additional 17mm ground clearance, the xi is particularly suited to stretches of snow 
and ice covered roads and its sure footedness is made possible by the use of the Bosch 
DSC III 5.7 system, first used on the X5. 

Performance of the all-wheel drive E46 does not suffer either, this is because of a light¬ 
weight all-wheel drive system that only adds 100kg (220lbs). Weight distribution is largely 
unaffected at 52.7% front and 47.3% rear (2wd: 51.0% front, 49.0% rear).

Changes from the standard drive version are: 

A specially designed body pan with a widened transmission tunnel and modifications on 
the driver's side to accept the transfer case. 

Modified oil pan and engine mounts to provide access for the front axles. 

A completely new front engine carrier. 

Re-reinforcements for the front strut bearings. 

A compact new transfer case (NV 124). 

New transmission cross-member.

Chassis 


Front Axle 

The front axle has been completely re-designed over the standard drive E46. All 
components are constructed of steel. 



The front axle carrier consists of two 
square frame sections welded to two 
tubes to form a box structure. The 
axle carrier is bolted to the vehicle 
frame at both the front and rear 
attachment points. 

The steel lower control arms, which 
are smaller than the aluminum arms 
used on the 2wd model attach at the 
rear to the axle carrier. 


The pivot at the apex of the lower 
control arms are a separate ball joint 
bolted to the axle carrier. 

The purpose of the re-design of the 
lower control arms and mounting 
points is to provide clearance for the 
front axle shafts. 


The hydraulic engine mounts are 
different from the 2wd version and 
have also been relocated to provide 
front axle clearance. 

The front sway bar has been increased in diameter to 23.5mm (2wd standard: 23mm, 
sports suspension: 24mm) to accommodate the additional weight. A sports suspension 
option is not available for the xi.

The struts are shorter than the 2wd and there are reinforcement plates between the strut 
bearing and the sheet metal of the strut towers to prevent deformation when traveling on 
very poor road surfaces. 



The spring travel of the E46/16 is 
approximately 20mm less than 
the 2wd version. 

The shorter front axle spring 
travel is due to the limited angle 
of deflection of the front axle 
shafts. 


Steering 

The rack and pinion steering unit 
has been modified from the 2wd. 
It is constructed with a 
larger diameter piston. 

This is necessary to counter the 
additional drag of the all-wheel 
drive system and the wider 
standard wheels and tires. 

The lower steering spindle is 
different than the 2wd and 
connects to the steering rack via 
a double cardan joint. 

Turning radius of the E46/16 is 
35.8ft, 1.4ft greater than the 
2wd.

Differential and Front Axles 

The differential for the front axle is bolted to left side of the engine oil pan. The differential 
is driven by a 40mm single piece drive 
shaft. The drive shaft has universal 
joints at both ends. 

Type: VAG 174 

Axle ratios: 330xi 325xi 

Auto: 3,46:1 3,46:1 

Man: 3,07:1 3,23:1 

Max torque: 2000Nm 

Weight: 40 lbs 

Lifetime fluid fill: 5AF-XO 


The oil sump has been modified to accommodate the right side axle. A connecting tube is 
welded into the oil pan. A shaft runs inside of the connecting tube between the front 
differential and the axle shaft on the right side. 


Two drive shafts of equal length are used to 
transmit power to the front wheels. 




The steering knuckle is modified to 
accept the CV joint of the front axles. 
The front wheel bearings are unique 
to the E46/16 and incorporate the 
wheel speed sensor pulse wheel into 
the bearing seal.

The rear spring/strut travel of the E46/16 is approximately 17mm less than the 2wd version. 
The reason forthe reduced travel in the rear is to oppose any excessive body roll as a result 
of the higher body profile. 

The rearsway bar has been increased in diameterto 20mm (2wd standard: 18mm, sports 
suspension: 19mm) to accommodate the additional weight. 



Rear Axle 

The complete rear axle and the rear differential are the same as the 2wd version of the 325i 
and 330i 


Tires and wheels 

Standard wheel size is 17x 7.0 to ensure there is enough room for the front axles and 
brakes. Tire size is 205/50 R17 All-season radials

Transmissions 


There are two transmission variants for the 325xi and 330xi 


The manual transmission for both versions is 
the S5D-280Z direct gear transmission. The 
extension housing is modified to accept the 
transfer case. 

The transmission has a lifetime fill of MTF-LT1 
synthetic transmission fluid. 




The automatic transmission for both the 330xi 
and 325xi is the A55-390 R (General Motors) 
transmission with G5 20 AGS control and 
Steptronic shifter. 

The transmission has a lifetime fill of Texaco 
8072B. 


Transmission Cross-member 

Along with the lower transfer case section, the 
cast aluminum transmission cross-member is a 
low profile design to optomize ground clear¬ 
ance. 

Both manual and automatic transmissions 
utilize the same part.

Transfer Case 


The Transfer case for the E46/16 is the N V 124 manufactured by New Venture. The 
primary difference between the NV 124 and the NV 125 used in the X5 5AV is that it uses 
gears instead of a drive chain for torque transfer to the front axle. 



The reason gears are used is to produce a 
compact low profile transfer case that could 
fit in the transmission tunnel of an E46 with¬ 
out excessively limiting the forward travel of 
the drivers seat.

The transfer case is only one speed and 
does not use any viscous coupler. 

The transmission ratio of the planetary gear 
set provides a fixed torque transfer of 38:62 
(front:Rear). The output speeds to the front 
and rear axle are the same (1:1). 



The Sun Gear of the Planetary 
assembly is turned by the 
Planetary Gears, the Sungear 
then provides torque to the 
Transfer Gear.
