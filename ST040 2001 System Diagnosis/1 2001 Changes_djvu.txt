20 PIN DIAGNOSTIC SOCKET DELETION 


Model: E39,E46,E52,E53 

Production Date: E46 from 6/00 

E39,E 52,E53 from 9/00 


For model year 2001 the E39, E46 and E53 will eliminate the 20 pin diagnostic connector 
from the engine compartment. The 16 pin OBD II connector located inside the vehicle will 
be the only diagnosis port. 

The E38 and Z3 will continue to use the 20 pin connector. 


The 16 pin OBD II connector has been in all 
BMWs since 1996 to comply with OBD II 
regulations requiring a standardized diagnostic 
port. 

Previously before 2001, only emissions relevant 
data could be extracted from the OBD II 
connector because it did not provide access to 
TXD (D-bus). The TXD line is connected to pin 
8 of the OBD II connector on vehicles without 
the 20 pin diagnostic connector. 


The cap to the OBD II connector contains a 
bridge that links KL 30 to TXD and TXD II. This 
is to protect the diagnostic circuit integrity and 
prevent erroneous faults. 

The OBD II connector is located in the drivers 
footwell to the left of the steering column of E39, 
E46 and E53 vehicles. 

Special tool 61 4 300 is used to connect to the 
20 pin diagnostic lead of the DIS until the intro¬ 
duction of the DIS plus.

2001 model year changes 


Engines 


Two M54 engine variants will be added to the E39 for the 2001 M .Y. starting production 
9/00. The M54 B30 and M54 B25. The M54 B30 engine will replace the M52 B28TU of 
the 528i and become the 530i. The M54 B25 engine equipped 5 Series will create a new 
model, the 525i, it will become the entry level 5 series. 

The design objectives for the M54 engine were: 

Lower emissions 
M aintain fuel economy 
Increase power and performance. 

The 540i/it will use the A5S 440Z automatic transmission with Steptronic as standard 
equipment and continues to have the optional 6 speed manual. The 525i and 530i 
models will use the A5S 390R (G M 5) with Steptronic as optional equipment until M arch of 
2001 at which time the GM5 will be replaced by the A5S 325Z (5HP 19). 

Please refer tx> the 2000 Systems Diagnosis course material ST 039 for information concerning the

front air dam. The new lights use an H8 12V 
35 W halogen bulb. 



Park Distance Control 

The 2001 E39 will have Front and Rear PDC available as an option. The system operates 
just as the E38 and E53 with the same system. The vehicle is fitted with a PDC switch 
located on the SZM. Activation is automatic with reverse gear engagement, but may be 
deactivated with the switch. The switch may also be used to activate the system. Criteria 
for operation remain unchanged from previous systems.

Head and Tail Lights 


The head and tail lights of the 2001 E39 have received a new look, utilizing optical wave 
guide technology. The wave guides are an innovation that are not only aesthetically 
pleasing, but also enhance safety. 



Head Lights 

The front headlights have been completely redesigned, however they fit into the existing 
body without any sheet metal changes. The high and low beam headlights are free-form 
reflectors and no longer use the glass lenses. The turn signal has been given its own 
circular lens next to the low beam. 


10 

2001 model year changes 




The parking light and side marker use the optical wave guide technology. Clear rings 
surround the high and low beam reflectors. The rings are illuminated by a light source 
module similarto the ones used in the Visual Entry Aid system. Output voltage forthe light 
source module comes from the parking lamp final stage of the LCM III. There is one light 
source module located at the back of the head light housing between the high and low 
beam headlights. The side marker for US models also has an additional wave guide con¬ 
ductor for illumination. 





US version side marker reflector with wave 
guide illumination. 


Third generation Xenon headlights manufactured by Hella are standard equipment on V-8 
powered cars and available as an option on the 6 cylinder models. All xenon equipped 
vehicles also use LWR automatic headlight adjustment to maintain the vertical adjustment 
ofthe headlights at any vehicle load. (Refertothe 1999 Model Update training for details of sys¬ 
tem operation) 


11 

2001 model year changes 








Tail lights 


The rear light housings have also been modi¬ 
fied for 2001. No body changes were neces¬ 
sary. 

The LED illuminated tail lights provide an excit¬ 
ing fresh look to the part of a 5 Series most dri¬ 
vers on the road are familiar with. 


Each tail light housing contains 4 wave guide 
assemblies. At either end of the wave guides 
is a printed circuit board with 4 LEDs. The 
LEDs provide the illumination for the tail light 
only. US models use an additional 4 LEDs in 
the corner of the housing as a side marker. 




On Sport Wagon models, the tail light assem¬ 
bly is two pieces. In this case there continue 
to be only two sets of LEDs; one supplying 
light for each half of the housing. US models 
also have two LEDs for the side marker. 


The advantage to using LEDs is the longer life 
span as well as lower power consumption. 


The function of the LC M III remains unchanged from the previous year with the exception 
that because of the LED illuminated tail lights, there is no tail light monitoring function. The 
LCM III module has been updated for the new lighting features of the 2001 E39. All 
replacement LCM modules will supercede to this version in the parts system and it can be 
used on earlier vehicles.

E39 IHKR 


The 525i/it will be fitted with IHKR as standard 
equipment. IHKA will be available as an option 
on those vehicles by ordering the Convenience 
package: SA 466. 



IHKR is a semi-automatically regulated heating 
and air-conditioning system. The components 
are similar to the IHKR system used in the X5 
3.0i. 



The E39 IHKR is a single zone system that regulates the temperature of the cabin based 
on the occupants desired temperature, selected by a temperature setting dial. Blowercon- 
trol, air distribution settings and stratification flap are manual. 

System Components 


The E39 IHKR consists of the following components: 

IH KR control unit with operating controls 
IHKR integrated heater and air conditioning case 
1 Heater core temperature sensor 
Evaporator temperature sensor 
Interior temperature sensor (located in drivers footwell)

Functional Description: 

Air distribution: is carried out using the mechanical rotary dial acting on three 
bowden cables. 


Blower adjustment: is carried out using the rotary dial potentiometer (22 steps). The 
control unit signals the final stage via a variable voltage signal. 


Temperature control: The desired interior temperature is set with the rotary dial 
potentiometer on the control panel. Temperature regulation is based on the Y-factor. 
The inputs used to determine the Y-factor are: 

Position of the temperature control potentiometer dial 

Heater core temperature 

Coolant temperature 

Exterior Temperature 

Interior Temperature 


Control of the interior temperature is carried out by the control unit cycling the water 
valve to regulate the temperature of the heater core. During heater operation the 
auxiliary water pump will be switched on to increase coolant circulation through the 
heater core. The service station feature is carried over to the E39 IHKR. 


Fresh air/recirculation: Recirculation is requested by an input to the control panel 
button or the M FL. The control unit actuates the fresh air/re-circ stepper motor for 
control of the flap position. Ram effect air is compensated for. 

Air conditioning: The request for air conditioning is made by means of a push button. 


15 

2001 model year changes 







The IHKR control module communicates with the DME via the K-Bus/KOM BI/CAN Bus 
link to request permission for compressor activation. The control of the compressor 
clutch is directly by the IH KA module via a final stage. 

Rear Window Defroster: The rear window defroster is controlled via a request from 
the button on the panel. After switching on for the first time, the rear window is heated 
for 10 minutes. Output voltage to the window is provided by the K13 rear defogger 
relay. After automatic switch off, if the button is pressed once again the control unit wil 
provide a clocked operation alternating at 40 seconds on and 80 seconds off. If the 
vehicle voltage drops below 11.4V during this second heating operation the function is 
stopped, however the LED on the button will not be extinguished. If voltage increases 
past 12.2V for at least one second, clocked operation will resume. Clocked operation 
continues until the button is pressed again or the ignition is cycled. 

Washer J et Heating: The IHKR provides operating current to the washer jet heaters 
based on outside temperature. The washer jets are heated below an outside 
temperature of 37° F. 


K-Bus Communication: The IH KR control unit is on the vehicle K-bus and receives 


and sends information concerning: 

Engine temperature, RP M, KL61, KL50, compressor request, auxiliary fan request, 
compressor load (DME) 

Outside temperature KL15 and road speed (KOMBl)

Changes made to the E39 IHKA 

New Control Unit (since 9/00). 

Addition of solar sensor (since 9/00). 

New IHKA integrated heater and air conditioning case (since 3/00). 


IHKA IV Control Unit 


The "REST" button on the control unit has been 
replaced with a "MAX" button. Two different functions 
are carried out by pushing the MAX button: 

Maximum cooling function 
Residual heat function 


Determination of which function w 
based on switching criteria. 


be enabled is 



A/C MAX function 

(This feature was introduced in the E38 since 9/99) 

Maximum cooling performance is automatically activated by pressing the MAX button. An 
LED on the button illuminates to indicate that the function is active. 

Criteria for operation: 

Terminal 15 "on", MAX button pressed and outside temperature above 60° F. 

The following settings are adjusted or activated: 

Temperature control is canceled and the temperature display indicates 60° F. 

Both water valves are closed. 

The left and right Y-factors are set to -27.5%. 

The compressor is switched on (LED turns on in the A/C switch). 

The blower setting is set to maximum. 

Recirculation is activated (LED turns on in the re-circ switch). 

Air distribution is set to center vents only. 

Operation of the max defrost is overridden by selecting MAX. The operation of the rear win¬ 
dow defogger is not affected. 


19 

2001 model year changes 

















REST Function 

The REST function continues to operate as usual exceptthatthe MAX button has taken the 
place of the REST button. Activation criteria continues to be: 

Ignition "OFF” or in KL R. 

"MAX" button pressed. 

Outside temperature below 60° F. 

Coolant temperature above 80°C. 

Batten/ voltage above 11.4V. 

The REST feature operates as previously. 

Diagnostics 

The IHKA IV diagnosis has been upgraded to the E46 style diagnostic program. 

Solar Sensor 

The IH KA IV integrates the solar sensor into the 
calculation used to automatically regulate the 
interior vehicle temperature. The sensor is 
located in the right side defrost outlet. 

In the case of a very sunny day, the interior 
warms faster than the control unit can compen¬ 
sate for. Similar is true if the weather suddenly 
becomes overcast. 

The input of the solar sensor in the E39 can 
affect the operation of: 

Blower setting 

Air distribution to center vent 

Because the E39 IH KA IV is a dual zone system, the solar sensor housing contains two 
photo-resistors that measure solar radiation on the left and right halves of the interior. 

(Please refer to the Solar Sensor module in the 2000 
Systems Diagnosis training course ST 039 for a com¬ 
plete description of the solar sensor operation and 

diagnosis)

IHKA integrated heater and air conditioning case 

The E39 IHKA case has been redesigned since 3/00. The E39 and E53 both share the 
same case design. 


The difference from the previous case is that a single flap (left and right), controls both the 
fresh air and recirculation inlets. Ram air is controlled by a separate flap. What makes it 
possible to use a single flap forfresh air/re-circ is the semi-circular door; as one inlet is cov¬ 
ered another is opened. 

Please refer to the Climate Control course material ST 054 for a complete functional description of 
ram air pressure compensation.

E39 Rear Head Protection System (HPS) 

For 2001, rear head protection airbags (HPS) 
will be available for sedans ordered with rear 
side airbags. 


The airbags are a cushion (not an ITS) that is 
deployed from the C-pillar. The HPS will not be 
de-activated along with the side airbags from 
the factory since there is no danger to small 
children sitting out of position. 

A vehicle with rear HPS can be identified by 
observing "HPS" embossed in the C-pillar 
cover. 

Rear airbags with HPS will be standard equipment on the 2001 E39 M 5.
