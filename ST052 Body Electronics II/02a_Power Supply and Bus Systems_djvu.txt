Bus Systems 


The introduction of the E38 marked the first large scale usage of bus networks on BMW 
vehicles. For the first time bus networks are used to reduce overall wiring requirements 
due to the expanding vehicle systems and increased functionality. 

The models subsequent to the E38, such as the E39 and E53 use a similar bus 
structure. The only difference in these vehicles is the use of the 1-Bus which is mostly 
dependent upon model year, vehicle equipment levels and options. 

These vehicle use the following bus networks: 


• Information Bus (1-Bus) 

• Body Bus (K-Bus) 

• Peripheral Bus (P-Bus) 

• Motor Bus (M-Bus) 

• Diagnosis Bus (D-Bus) 

• Controller Area Network (CAN-Bus)

Bus System Configuration 
l/K-Bus 

1-Bus - which is used on the E38, E39 with High Cluster and/or Navigation and the E53 
with High Cluster and/or Navigation. 

K-Bus - which is used on all vehicles (E38, E39 and E53) for communication with body 
electronic systems. On vehicles with the base cluster (Kombi), the K-Bus replaces the 
1-Bus functions. 

The I and K-Bus are mostly identical in operation, the only difference is their use by 
model. The wire colors are different as well. They use the same voltage levels and com¬ 
munication protocols.

Peripheral Bus 

The P-Bus is exclusive to vehicle equipped with ZKE III (E38, E39 and E53). The P-Bus 
is controlled by the General Module (GM III) and provides communication with various 
peripheral module such as Driver’s Door Switch Block Module, Passenger Door Module, 
Sunroof Module and the Seat Memory Module.

Controller Area Network 

The CAN-Bus was initially introduced as a network between the ECM (DME) and the 
Transmission Control Module. Beginning with he 99 model year, CAN was expanded to 
other modules including the instrument cluster.

The placement of the power distribution box is close to the main electronics carrier 
behind the glove box. The modules/relays located in the electronics carrier are dependent 
upon model, year and optional equipment. Examples of these modules include: 

• General Module III (GM III) 

• Drive away protection (EWS II) 

• Anti-lock Brake (ABS/ASC+T and early DSC 5.3 up to 99 MY) 

• Light Check Module (LCM) - behind right kick panel 

• Overload protection relay module 

• LWR Module 

• EDC Module (E38) 

Some of the relays found behind the glove box include: 

• K4 Blower Relay 

• K9 Unloader Relay 

• K72 Closed Circuit Cut-off Relay 

• K131 Visual Entry Aid Relay

TheX5 utilizes a single high amperage fused power distribution center located next 
to the left side EHC air reservoir beneath the cargo area floor paneling. 



An auxiliary fuse block is located in the trunk above the battery. In addition to fuses, 
the auxiliary fuse block also contains relays (examples): 

• Fuel filler flap lock motor relay 

• Fuel pump relay (some vehicles) 

• Rear defroster relay 

• Unloader relay

Fuses for Engine Electronics 

Located in the E-Box, a small fuse carrier contains 5 fuses for engine electronics. These 
fuses are designated FI through F5. These are not to be confused with the fuses for the 
body electronics systems which use the same numerical designation (FI -F5).

Battery 

The battery is installed in the luggage compartment area on modern BMW vehicles. 
This provides protection from the elements. This location also allows for optimum 
weight distribution and contributes to the overall vehicle handling capability. 



The battery locations are as follows: 

• E38 - right side of luggage compartment. 

• E38 750il_ (99-01 with dual battery system) -110Ah Battery in right 
side of luggage compartment, 75Ah battery located in bracket above. 

• E39 - right side of luggage compartment. 

• E39 Sportwagon - right side of luggage compartment behind subwoofer. 

• E53 - below spare tire in luggage compartment in battery box.

Dual Battery System (E38 750iL) 

In order to comply with emission regulations in 1999, the E38 750il_ (M73TU) utilizes an 
electrically heated catalytic converter. This system configuration reguired modification to 
the electrical system to meet the increased electrical load during startup. 

This necessitated the installation of a dual battery system which allows the vehicle 
electrical system to be unaffected by the current requirements of the E-CAT system.

The dual battery system works in conjunction with the E-CAT system and is controlled 
based on commands from the ECM (DME). 

The dual battery system consists of a starter battery (110Ah) which is used for starting 
and E-CAT operation. The second battery (55Ah) is located on a bracket above the 
starter battery. It provides the operating power for the vehicle electrical system. 

The batteries are connected by an electronically controlled battery isolation switch. The 
battery switch opens and closes the circuit between both batteries as needed based on 
monitored conditions.
