Driver Information 

Instrument Cluster 

The instrument cluster in the Z4 has a sporty appearance in line with a roadster. The 
instrument cluster is very compact. The needle instruments are integrated in 2 housing 
attachments. The two needle instruments for the speedometer and the tachometer are 
thus the predominant visual features. 



The needle instruments for the fuel gauge and the coolant temperature gauge are inte¬ 
grated in the tachometer. The speedometer incorporates an LC display, which shows e.g. 

the total mileage (odometer), the trip distance (trip odometer), the time, the on-board 
computer functions and the SIA service interval indicator. 

Between the large needle instruments are the indicator and warning lamps and the 
program and gear display. The program and gear display is only featured in vehicles with 
automatic transmissions and SMG sequential manual gearboxes. 

The instrument cluster is the central gateway in the bus network.

Instrument-Cluster Plug Connection 

The 26-pin plug connection is located on the reverse side of the instrument cluster. 



New System Features/Modifications 

The main feature of the instrument cluster in the Z4 is its new design: 

• The indicator and warning lamps between the needle instruments. The coolant 
temperature gauge and the fuel gauge are integrated in the tachometer. 

• Additional indicator and warning lamps (e.g. Electric Power Steering EPS) are inte¬ 
grated. 

• The automatic gearbox or Seguential Manual Gearbox SMG has a liquid-crystal dis¬ 
play for indicating the gear. 

• The instrument cluster of the Z4 has a gateway function between the bus systems 
(as in the E46) K-Bus, PT-CAN Bus and diagnosis bus. 

• The lighting of the instrument cluster is controlled by means of the K-Bus. 

• The instrument cluster has a modified voltage supply with undervoltage detection. 

• The acoustic alarms and test functions have been expanded.

E85 Driver Information 










System Components 

The instrument-cluster system comprises the following components: 

• Needle instruments 

• Indicator and warning lamps 

• LC display 

• Program and gear display for automatic gearbox and SMG Sequential Manual 
Gearbox 

• Acoustic generator for outputting acoustic alarms 

• Acoustic generator for outputting turn-signal flasher rate 

• Two setting buttons, integrated in instrument cluster 

• Connected components which serve to activate the displays/ indications in the 
instrument cluster (see system overview/system schematic) 



Display Areas 

The instrument cluster is divided into the following display areas: 

• Needle instruments 

• Indicator and warning lamps 

• LC display 

• Program and gear display for automatic transmission and 
Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) 


7 

E85 Driver Information 


















Instrument-Cluster Lighting 

The speedometer and the tachometer are illuminated by slit light between the dial face 
and the graduated dial. The brightness of the dial-face, needle and display illumination 
(dimming) is determined by the LSZ light switch center. The lights ON signal is transmit¬ 
ted from the LSZ light switch center to the instrument cluster (via the K-Bus). The dim¬ 
ming signal is also transmitted via the K-Bus. The LSZ evaluates the following input sig¬ 
nals to control dimming: 

• Dimmer (knurl in light switch center) 

• Photoelectric cell for ambient brightness (in light switch center) 

Because the dimming signal is sent via the K-Bus, there is no need for terminal 58g. 

Instrument Cluster Power Supply 

The power supply of the instrument cluster is by means of a switching controller. The 
switching controller compensates for voltage fluctuations of the vehicle electrical system 
in the range from 9 V to 16 V. 

Undervoltage: the vehicle voltage is measured as of terminal 30 every 30 milliseconds. 
As of a voltage of approx. 7.5 V, undervoltage is detected. Then, no more read and write 
accesses are permitted to the EEPROM. Prior to a possible undervoltage reset, the 
instrument cluster initiates a data backup. 

Overvoltage: overvoltage is detected in the case of a voltage >16 V. The microcontroller 
initiates measures to back up the hardware. Data (mileage, SIA data, time, date, etc.) or 
states are not lost because they are stored in good time. Indicator and warning lamps are 
switched off or dimmed for the duration of the overvoltage. 

Undervoltage Detection 

The instrument cluster incorporates an undervoltage-detection facility. Undervoltage 
detection is performed in the instrument cluster with the aid of a comparator (software- 
based voltage comparison). 

Note: 

Overvoltage in the electrical system is also detected. In the event of a system voltage 
>16 volts, it is possible for: 

• Inputs and outputs to be deactivated 

• Indicator and warning lamps to be deactivated or dimmed for the duration of the over 
voltage 

Coolant Temperature Gauge 

In the event of coolant over-temperature, a warning sound is issued when the red indica¬ 
tor and warning lamp lights up. The signal is delivered by the DME via the PT-CAN Bus.

E85 Driver Information 



Fuel Gauge 

The indicator lamp is activated when the fuel reserve drops below a threshold coded at 
the plant (standard = 8 liters). 

Indicator Lamps 

There are a total of 24 indicator and warning lamps in the instrument cluster of the new 
Z4. The following two lamps are new additions to the established lamps: 

• Indicator lamp for EPS: The Electric Power Steering system is used in the new Z4 
for the first time. 

• Indicator lamp for lamp monitoring: This lamp indicates lamp failure in the headlights, 
rear lights and brake lights and is activated by the light switch center. 

The instrument cluster receives input signals through the following channels: 

• Via the K-Bus 

• Via the PT-CAN Bus 

• Directly from the sensors

Pre-Drive Check 

The Pre-drive Check is a test of important indicator and warning lamps. In the Pre-drive 
Check, these indicator and warning lamps are activated for 2 seconds with terminal 
15 ON. 

All the indicator and warning lamps are deactivated at the end of the Pre-drive Check. 

LC Display 

The LC display is located between the speedometer and the tachometer. With terminal 
15 OFF, run-on operation is possible provided the SMG is still transmitting CAN 
telegrams. 

The LC display is integrated in the speedometer. It has been adapted to the E85 instru¬ 
ment cluster and operates in the same way as that of the E46.

Instrument Cluster as Gateway 

The instrument cluster is the interface between K-Bus, PT-CAN Bus and diagnosis bus. 
The instrument cluster communicates with other control units in the car via the K-Bus 
(single-wire) or the PT-CAN Bus (two-wire). 

On-Board Computer 

The on-board computer functions are the same as those of the E46. A new feature in the 
E85 is the possibility of combining time and outside temperature in the display depend¬ 
ing on the equipment specification. 


16 

E85 Driver Information 














































































On-board computer display in navigation-system on-board monitor 

In cars equipped with the High navigation system, the on-board computer functions are 
displayed in the pop-up on-board monitor (Central Information Display CID). 

The "Distance to junction" navigation data is displayed in parallel in the instrument 
cluster. 

Settings (e.g. units or reset) which are made at the navigation system controls using the 
rotary pushbutton are sent by bus telegram to the instrument cluster. 

The date can be set at the navigation-system controls. The date is administered in the 
instrument cluster and shown in the on-board monitor. 

Redundant Data Storage (RDA) 

The kilometer reading/mileage and the data of the SIA service interval indicator are stored 
redundantly in the following control units: instrument cluster, LSZ light switch center and 
EWS electronic immobilizer.The above-mentioned data are thus retained when the con¬ 
trol units are replaced. 

Notes for Service 

Test Functions 

The test functions are used by service mechanics to check the coding. They also provide 
help in troubleshooting without the diagnostic tester. 

The test functions are only shown in the instrument-cluster LC display. 

The test functions are activated by pressing the left setting button in the instrument clus¬ 
ter (S/R, 5 seconds) with terminal R or terminal 15 ON. In addition, the test functions can 
still be called up by pressing the left setting button (S/R for Set/Reset) in the instrument 
cluster with simultaneous activation of terminal R. 

The test functions are shown in the odometer and trip-odometer display areas in the top 
line of the display. 

The display of the on-board computer function is retained in the bottom display line. 

Test Function 19 

Only the first two test functions are freely accessible. All further test functions are locked 
from the third test function. The lock can only be removed by means of test function 19. 

In test function 19, the display switches in intervals of 1 second from L_on to L_oFF 
(Lock on and Lock off). The test functions are unlocked or locked by pressing the left set¬ 
ting button (S/R for Set/Reset).

Visual System Test 

In the visual system test, all the indicator lamps and lights - with the exception of the ABS 
warning lamp - are activated briefly. The needle instruments are moved from the lower to 
upper stop and back again. 



Diagnosis 

Component replacement and trial replacement There are three possible combinations for 
replacing the instrument cluster/light switch center: 

• Instrument cluster faulty, light switch center OK 

• Light switch center faulty, instrument cluster OK 

• Light switch center and instrument cluster must be replaced 

Simultaneous replacement of the light switch center and the instrument cluster must be 
avoided. The odometer reading will be lost. In principle it is also possible to carry out a 
trial replacement of the instrument cluster/light switch center.
