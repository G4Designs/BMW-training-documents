System Components 


Battery 

The Battery is located in the luggage 
compartment right hand side. Battery 
power is split with one leg routed through 
a 250 amp fuse to the main fuse box 
behind the glove box. The other circuit is 
sent through the BST and to the new 
monitored B+ cable that supplies power 
to the starter and alternator. 

Depending on equipment on the vehicle 
either a 50AH, 70AH or 80AH battery is 
installed.

Monitored B+ Cable 

The Monitored B+ Cable is a mutli-strand aluminum cable with a cross section of 
80mm2. 


The aluminum cable is sheathed with an insulating layer and surrounded by a detecting 
shielded cable. An outer insulating sheath covers the entire assembly.

4. Multi-Strand Aluminum Cable 


The Monitored B+ cable is routed underneath the vehicle from the battery box along the 
floor pan to the engine compartment jumper cable point. The B+ cable is attached to the 
underside of the body with two different style clips. The cable is protected with plastic 
shielding. (Description of cable monitoring is found in Safety Systems.)

Fuse Box and Fuses 

The Fuse Box is located behind the glove box and accessible by removing the glove box 
door and underdash panel. The fuse box contains blade type fuse and special fuses for 
higher amperage consumers. Relays are located on both the front and back sides of the 
fuse box.

Alternator 

Depending on country and equipment the vehicle is equipped with different output 
alternators. 

Battery charging voltage varies according to ambient temperature. At lower temperatures, 
the battery is less susceptible to boiling over and can be charged at higher voltages. At 
high temperature the charging voltage is reduced to prevent loss of the battery electrolyte 
through evaporation. 

The DME controls the output rate of the alternator.

Jumper Cable Point 


The Jumper Cable Point is located in the engine compartment on the left side at the fire¬ 
wall. The jumper cable point is the junction for the Monitored B+ cable and the alternator 
and starter.

Bus Systems 

The bus system of the E85 is based on the E46. The E85 uses the K-Bus, PT CAN and 
the D-Bus of the E46. These busses have been modified to accommodate additional 
components and systems. In addition to these bus systems, the byteflight bus has been 
carried over from the E65. The byteflight bus is a fiberoptic bus used for the ASE 
system.
