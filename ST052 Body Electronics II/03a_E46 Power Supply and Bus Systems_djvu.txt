E46 Power Supply and Bus Systems 




E46 Power Supply 

The power supply system in the E46 is used to supply power and ground to the various 
components and systems. Some of the components include: 

• Front power distribution box (fusebox) 

• Battery and battery cables 

• Grounding points 

• Main fuse located in trunk 

• Battery Safety Terminal 

• Alternator (Generator) 


Front Power Distribution 

The main (front) fuse box is located behind the glovebox. The fuse panel is accessed by 
rotating two twist locks 90 degrees and allowing the fuse panel to drop into view. The 
fuse panel includes fuses 1 -71. 

There are also two large fuses (red 50 Amp) which provide power for the IHKA blower 
and secondary air pump system. 


Note: Always check the proper and most current ETM when checking fuses. 

Due to optional equipment and production changes, some fuse numbers 
and locations may vary.

E46 Power Supply and Bus Systems 











Located above the fuse panel, there are additional high amperage power distribution 
fuses (FI 01-FI 07). 


This location differs from the E38/E39 in which these high amperage fuses were located 
under the front passenger carpet. 



Fuse Card 

There is also a fuse location card in the front fuse box to assist in locating various fuses.

Main Fuse 

The main fuse (FI 08) is located on the right hand side of the trunk, near the battery. 
FI 08 is a 200 amp fuse which feeds the front power distribution box. FI 08 supplies 
fuses FI 01 -107 as well as F35-F71. 



Electronics Carrier 


The electronics carrier is located behind the glove box and contains various control mod¬ 
ules and relay. Depending upon equipment levels and options, the carrier will contain dif¬ 
ferent modules. 


There are some modules and relays which will be present regardless of equipment, 
these include the General Module, fuel pump relay, horn relay, foglight relay and the 
blower relay for IHKA.

Battery Safety Terminal 

The E46 uses a trunk mounted battery which has a (B+) battery cable than runs the 
length of the vehicle. In the event of an accident, this cable could become compromised 
and there is a possibility of short circuit to the vehicle body. In order to reduce this 
possibility, the BST was added. 

The BST is a pyrotechnic device which will disconnect the battery during an impact of 
sufficient severity. Although the main battery cable will be disconnected, the connection 
to the power distribution circuits will remain intact to allow other vehicle features to 
remain operational (power windows, locks etc).

E46 Bus Systems 


In comparison to the E36, the E46 was the first 3 series vehicle to make extensive use of 
bus networks. The E46 benefitted from the latest bus technology which was introduced 
previously on the E38 and E39. 

The E46 bus network consists of the following busses: 

• Diagnosis Bus (D-Bus) • M-Bus 

• Controller Area Network (CAN Bus) • Body Bus (K-Bus) 

• Local Interconnect Network (LIN bus) (From 2003)

Diagnosis Bus (D-Bus) 

The D-bus is used for diagnostic purposes, formerly referred to as TXD (RXD), this bus is 
used as an interface between the diagnostic eguipment (DISPIus/Gt-1) and the various 
diagnoseable systems. 

The D-Bus is directly connected to certain modules for diagnosis, however some 
modules are diagnosed via a gateway. In the E46, the instrument cluster acts as a gate¬ 
way between the D-Bus, CAN bus and K-Bus. For example, in order to read out fault 
codes from the LSZ, the instrument cluster provides the gateway between the K-Bus and 
D-bus. 

From start of production, the E46 was eguipped with a 20-pin underhood diagnostic 
connection as well as the required OBD II diagnostic connector (DLC). The OBD II 
connector provided communication with the ECM (DME) and the EGS control modules 
using aftermarket diagnostic equipment. To allow this communication, TXD II was added 
as an dedicated connection. TXD II is identical to the D-bus, but is connected only to pin 
17 of the OBD II connector and the ECM. The EGS communicates via CAN. 

In model year 2001, the 20-pin diagnostic connector was deleted. BMW diagnostic 
equipment now communicated exclusively through the 16-pin DLC.

Body Bus (K-Bus) 

The K-Bus is used for the majority of systems on the E46. It differs from the l/K structure 
used on the E38 and E39. The E46 does not use the 1-Bus, but rather the K-Bus 
exclusively. 

The K-bus is a single wire network throughout the vehicle. The K-bus voltage is approxi¬ 
mately 12 volts. 

Controller Area Network (CAN Bus) 

The CAN bus is a two wire bus used to allow communication between powertrain related 
components and systems. The CAN network on the E46 uses a twisted pair configura¬ 
tion which also uses two terminal resistors of 120 ohms each for a total circuit resistance 
of 60 ohms. 

M Bus 

The M bus is used exclusively for the climate control system. The M bus allows the 
IHKA/R control module to communicate with the various stepper motors for temperature 
regulation and air flap control. There are 4 stepper motors used on the M-bus of the 
E46. 

Local Interconnect Network (LIN Bus) 

The LIN bus was not introduced on the E46 from start of production. The LIN bus was 
added to the E46 from 2003 for Adaptive Headlights (AHL) and for side view mirror 
control. The LIN bus consists of a single yellow/violet (GE/VI) wire.
