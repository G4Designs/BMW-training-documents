Door Locks with Hall-Effect Sensors 

The door locks each contain a Hall-effect sensor for detecting the door position. In addi¬ 
tion, there are two Hall-effect sensors in the driver's door which monitor the position of 
the lock barrel. 

The Hall-effect sensors signal to the general module that one of the doors is being 
opened, for example. The general module briefly lowers the window in the door 
concerned. The window has to be lowered in order that the door can be opened. 

General Module 5 

The General Module is attached to the lower trim behind the glove compartment. The 
general module controls the power window functions. It receives the input signals from 
the door locks and the switch units, and monitors the power consumption of the electric 
motors that drive the window regulator mechanisms. 

The E85 has no anti-trap function available. Conseguently, one-touch closing on the 
passenger side is not allowed. One-touch closing on the driver's side is possible at key 
positions starting from terminal 15. 

One-touch opening is possible at key positions starting from terminal 15 on the driver's 
and passenger sides. 



9 

E85 Central Body Electronics 


Power-Window Switches 

The power-window switches are integrated in the arm rests of the door trim panels. The 
driver's-side power-window switch unit also incorporates a switch for the passenger-side 
window, the buttons for the door mirrors and the mirror folding button. 

Each power-window switch has four positions. Those positions trigger different functions 
depending on country-specific variations and the programming of the general module. 
The passenger-side power-window switch also has four positions. 

Both window switches provide a ground input to the general module. 



Window Regulator 

The window regulator mechanisms are cable operated. The drive motor is not monitored 
by Hall-effect sensors.

General Module 

The General Module controls the central locking functions on the E85. 

Driver's-Door Lock 

The driver's door lock on the E85 is a Low lock. The same lock was previously fitted as a 
Low lock on the E66. Compared with the lock used on the E46, this unit incorporates 
two Hall-effect sensors. The general module analyzes the signals from those sensors and 
locks/thief-proofs or unlocks the vehicle accordingly. 

The order of the signals determines how they are interpreted, i.e. as lock/theft-proof or 
unlock. By the use of two Hall-effect sensors and the intelligent analysis of their signals, 
errors when locking/theft-proofing or unlocking the vehicle are prevented. 

Detection of a rising edge starts a counter which is stopped again as soon as both sig¬ 
nals (SNU 1 and SNU 2) are present. Within a valid time window, the reguest to 
lock/theft-proof or unlock is set. As long as the key is held in the turned position, the 
reguest to lock/theft-proof or unlock remains valid. If either of the two signals (SNU 1 or 
SNU 2) is lost, the reguest is reset again.

Central Locking Servo Units 

The door lock is a single unit. That unit incorporates the servo motor, the door lock 
mechanism and the Hall-effect sensors. 



Storage Compartment 

The storage compartment is integrated in the central locking system and can be 
locked/unlocked using the remote control, the driver's-door lock or the Central lock but¬ 
ton. 

Inside the trunk on the bulkhead there is an emergency release. 

The storage compartment is between the passenger seat and the driver's seat in the 
bulkhead trim.

2. Storage compartment retainer 


Fuel Filler Flap 

The fuel filler flap is incorporated in the central locking system. There is an emergency 
release for the fuel filler flap inside the trunk on the right side under the trunk lining. 



14 

E85 Central Body Electronics 









Trunk Lock 

The trunk lock and lock barrel are 
identical with those on the E46. 

The difference between the E85 
and the E46 is the linkage between 
the lock and the lock barrel. Instead 
of a rod linkage, a cable is used. 

The lock is released (manually) by a 
cable mechanism operated by the 
key. The switch for the anti-theft 
alarm system is incorporated in the 
lock barrel. 

The trunk lock can be operated 
manually or electrically. The GM V 
controls the motor in the trunk lock 
by means of the "Trunk lock, motor 
unlock" signal. The locking pawl is 
moved to the release position by 
the drive pin. The locking pawl 
releases the latch which can then rotate into the disengaged position by the action of the 
tension spring. The trunk can then be opened. The locking pawl releases the 
microswitch button from the depressed position. The microswitch switches the trunk 
light on. 

The trunk can be unlocked from the lock barrel. The trunk lock can be unlocked by 
means of a cable operated by the lock barrel. 

The locking pawl is pulled to the release position by the cable. The locking pawl releases 
the latch which can then rotate into the disengaged position by the action of the tension 
spring. The trunk can then be opened. 

Emergency Trunk Release 

The emergency trunk release operates in a similar manner to the mechanical method 
using the key. The only difference is the actuating device. 

A person locked inside the trunk can pull the release handle on the inside of the trunk. 
The handle is connected to a release cable and attached to the inner trunk lid. Pulling the 
release handle releases the trunk lock in a similar manner to the preceding description 
(mechanical method) so that the trunk can be opened.

E85 Central Body Electronics 










Power Seat 


The seat adjustment and memory functions are carried over from the E46. 

The memory functions are only available for the driver's seat. 

Manual Adjustment of Drives 

The adjustment switches in the switch block are used for adjusting the seat manually. 

The adjustment switch (with integrated control module) is located on the sides of the 

seats facing the door. 

The following adjustments can be made with these switches: 

• Seat fore/aft adjustment 

• Seat height adjustment 

• Seat backrest angle adjustment 

• Seat angle adjustment 

Programming a Memory Position 

On the vehicle, the ignition lock must be in position 1 or 2. 

Activate the memory button on the memory switch. Programming readiness is indicated 

by the memory button lighting up. 

Press one of the 3 position buttons to store the current seat position. 

The indicator lamp goes out after pressing the position button. 

Program readiness is canceled if no position button is pressed within 7 seconds. 

The position button goes out. 

Calling up a Memory Position 

A differentiation is made between two operating modes when stored seat positions 

are retrieved: 

• Touch button operation - In single-strike mode, it is enough to briefly press one 
of the 3 position buttons to start the positioning procedure. Positioning runs auto¬ 
matically until the target position is reached. The touch button operation is effective 
if the driver's door is opened and the ignition-lock is in position 0 or 1. With the dri¬ 
ver's door closed, touch button operation is effective in ignition lock position 1. 

• Continuous button operation - To call up a seat position, the corresponding 
position button must be pressed continuously to maintain positioning. If the button is 
released before the target position is reached, the corresponding drive is switched 
off immediately. The positioning procedure is continued when the position button is 
pressed again. If another position button is pressed, the positioning procedure for 
the new position is started. The continuous button operation is effective if the dri¬ 
ver's door is opened and the ignition-lock is in position 2. With the driver's door 
closed, continuous button operation is effective in ignition lock position 0 or 2.

Detection of End Stops 

In order to avoid unnecessary engine load and of the ripple count module, there is auto¬ 
matic detection of the adjustment range limits. 


Should a block be detected several times in the same position, the detected position 
value is interpreted as the end stop. Any further adjustment is terminated before this limit 
is reached. 

An incorrectly detected end stop (e.g. blocking of the seats caused by objects lying 
around) can be overridden after removal of the blocking, by activating the manual adjust¬ 
ment switch.

Seat Heating 

The seat heating functions are based on those on the E46. The seat heater is activated 
and controlled by means of the seat heater button integrated into the SZM in the center 
console. 

The seat heating system heats the seat cushion area and backrest. The electronics for 
controlling the selected heating temperature (3 stages) and fault monitoring are integrat¬ 
ed in the switching center (SZM).

Function 

Seat heating can be switched on in three heating stages as from terminal 15 by pressing 
the button. Three LEDs built into the switching center light to indicate operation. 

"Terminal 15 active" is signalled to the switching center via the K-Bus. 

Initially, heating stage 1 is activated when the seat heating is switched on (button pressed 
once). The seat surface is heated up to approximately. 44°C. All three LEDs light to indi¬ 
cate operation. 

By pressing the button once more, the topmost LED goes out and heating stage 2 is 
activated. The seat is now only heated up to 39°C. 

18 

E85 Central Body Electronics 










The seat heating system is switched to heating stage 3 by pressing the button once 
again. The bottom-most LED lights. The seat is heated up to 35°C. 

The seat heating is switched off by pressing the button once again or switching off the 
ignition. The seat heating can also be switched off in any heating stage by pressing the 
push button for longer than 1 second. 

The seats are heated by means of carbon fiber heating mats in the main section and 
steel wires (steel filament) in the bolster. A carbon fiber heating mat is installed in both the 
seat cushion section as well as in the backrest. The center sections of the seat and back¬ 
rest as well as the bolsters of the seat and backrest are always heated. Heating filament 
or carbon fibre mats are additionally integrated in the thigh support on sports seats. 

The temperature is measured by a temperature sensor in the seat upholstery and passed 
on to switching center. 

Monitoring Functions 
Battery Voltage 

The electronic seat heating control switches off the power supply to the heating mats if 
the battery voltage in the vehicle is less than 11.4 V ±0.3 V. The function LEDs however 
remain on. Power supply to the heating mats is restored when the battery voltage is 
greater than 12.2 V ±0.3 V for at least 5 seconds. 

PC-Board Temperature 

Due to the fact that the power input of the seat heating system is very high (120 W), the 
temperature of the pc-board in the switching center is monitored by temperature sensors. 
Initially, the heating power is reduced as the temperature increases to over 85°C. The 
heating is switched off if the pc-board temperature exceeds 95°C. The function LEDs 
however remain on. The seat heating cuts in automatically again when the pc-board tem¬ 
perature drops below 85°C. 

Fault Monitoring 

The electronic seat heating control system monitors the temperature sensor and heating 
mats for faults. Detected faults are stored in the fault code memory of the switching cen¬ 
ter. 

The following faults can be recognized: 

• Short-circuit or line break 

• Short-circuit or line break of temperature sensors 

• Break in heating mats 

If a break or short occurs at the temperature sensor, the seat heating is switched 
off in order to prevent overheating. The function LEDs are switched off.

Windshield Wash 

The wipe and wash functions are controlled by the general module (GM V). 

Wipe Functions 

All wiper functions are active as from ignition lock position 1 (terminal R). 

Wiper Stages 1 and 2 

Wiper stages ”1 ” and ”2” are controlled depending on the depending on the car's road 
speed. 


When stage 2 is switched on, stage 1 cuts in at > 210 km/h to prevent the windshield 
wiper arm from lifting.

Intermittent Mode 

Intermittent wipe is activated in the first setting of the wiper switch. The intermittent wipe 
time can be set by means of a rotary switch on the wiper switch in four stages. The inter¬ 
mittent wipe time is also influenced by the driving speed. 

Wiper Switch 
Switch Positions 

The wiper switch can be switched to the positions: 

• Intermittent wipe = First setting 

• Wiper stage 1 = Second setting 

• Wiper stage 2 = Third setting 

These positions are transferred via two signal lines to the general module.

Potentiometer for Wiper Interval 

A potentiometer in the form of a rotary switch is built into the wiper switch to vary the set¬ 
ting of the intermittent wipe interval. The rotary switch can be set in four stages. Based 
on different resistance values. The general module 5 can detect the switch position and 
thus the preselected intermittent wipe time.

Wiper Motor 

Wiper Motor and Wiper Relay 

The wiper motor is designed for two speed stages. It is powered via an external twin relay. 

The output Wl 1 (signal name) at the general module switches on the wiper. The output 
Wl 2 (signal name) switches the wiper motor to stage 2. 

Reset Contact 

The reset contact in the wiper motor serves the purpose of detecting the wiper rest 
position. The contact is designed as a slip ring. 

Interlock 

The signals from the wiper reset contact are used to detect possible blocking of the 
windshield wiper motor. 

The wiper motor is switched off immediately if there is no feedback from the reset con¬ 
tact for 16 seconds with the wiper motor switched on (e.g. to prevent dry running). 

The wiper motor is switched on again after a waiting time of 3 minutes or after terminal 
R off. 

However, the wiper motor is not switched on automatically even if the wiper switch 
remains on (risk of injury) but rather only after the wiper switch has been switched off 
and then on again. 

Jamming protection is active in all wiper stages! 


22 

E85 Central Body Electronics 



















Wash Functions 

The wash functions are controlled by the general module 5. 

A wash function is triggered by pressing the wipe-wash switch and switching on the 
windshield wipers in stage 1. The water pump is driven for as long as the wash function 
is implemented. 

After the pump is switched off, the wiper pump is activated for 3 wipe cycles to wipe 
the windshield dry. 

Rain/Light Sensor 

A rain/light sensor is available as an option on the E85. The headlights are switched on/off 
automatically by the rain/light sensor according to the ambient light conditions. The 
rain/light sensor detects the presence of water on the windshield and switches the wind¬ 
shield wiper on and off accordingly. 

The rain/light sensor is fitted in the base of the rear-view mirror and it consists of optical 
sensors. The RLS has 2 optical sensors integrated in the casing of the automatic interval 
control module. The 2 new sensors supplement the otherwise unchanged wiper interval 
control function of the automatic interval control module as follows: 

• An ambient-light sensor detects the light intensity above the vehicle within a wide 
scanning angle. 

• A forward light sensor detects the light intensity within a narrow scanning angle 
directly ahead of the vehicle. 

An internal processor calculates from the readings taken by the ambient and forward light 
sensors whether the preconditions for switching on the lights are present. 

The RLS checks the following preconditions for switching on the headlights: 

• Twilight 

• Complete darkness 

• Entry in underground car park 

• Entry in tunnel 

If any of the above conditions is met, the rain/light sensor on the E85 sends the informa¬ 
tion via the K-Bus to the light switch center. In order to be able to control the headlights 
automatically, the rain/light sensor must be activated by a separate light switch setting on 
the light switch center. 


23 

E85 Central Body Electronics 



If the light switch on the light switch center has been set to the position for automatic 
control of the headlights, the exterior/instrument panel lights are switched on by the light 
switch center. The preconditions for switching on the lights are as follows: 

• One of the rain/light sensor conditions listed above is met. 

• The fog lamps are switched on. 

Note: If the above conditions exist, the lights can only be switched off by switching off 
the fog lamps. In addition, the lights are switched on if any of the following faults occur: 

• The rain/light sensor detects a sensor fault. 

• There is a fault in communication between the rain/light sensor and the light 
switch center. 

The following lights are controlled by the light switch center: 

• If terminal R is "ON," the side lights, the licenser-plate light and the instrument panel 
lights are switched on. 

• If terminal 15 is "ON," the low-beam headlights are also switched on. If only the 
side lights are required at that setting, the switch on the light switch center must be 
manually set to Side lights "ON." 

• When the ignition switch is at position "0," the exterior/instrument panel lights are 
switched off. 

The switching thresholds of the rain/light sensor can be set to 2 different levels using the 
Car Memory function. 


Safety Notice!!! 


Automatic control of the headlights is not a substitute for 
individual assessment of the light/visibility conditions 
(e.g. fog) by the driver. In order to avoid safety risks in 
such situations, the lights must be switched on manually 
by the driver. The rain sensor controls the windshield 
wiper interval in rain or snow. 


Note: If the wiper switch is set to intermittent wipe, the activation condition is 
detected above a certain wiper frequency. When the vehicle leaves the 
factory, that wiper frequency is set to 15 wiper cycles per minute. The 
sensitivity of the rain sensor can be set to four different levels using the 
knurled adjuster on the wiper switch.

Consumer Cut-off 


Introduction 

This chapter describes the alterations to the central body electrical system (ZKE), "elec¬ 
trical consumer unit shutdown" (VA) and "sleep mode" as compared to the E46 electrical 
system. 

Changes Compared to E46 

Consumer Unit Shut-down 

There are 2 outputs for consumer unit shut-down. 

Sleep Mode 

New conditions 

K-Bus Messages 

New messages 

System Functions 
Consumer Shut-down 

The outputs VA1 and VA2 are available for consumer unit shut-down. The general mod¬ 
ule 5 has been expanded. There is now a second output available for consumer unit shut¬ 
down (VA). The consumer unit shut-down function switches consumer units to Sleep 
mode after 16 minutes. 

Consumer Unit Shut-down 1 (VA1) 

Consumer unit shut-down output 1 is factory-configured as a pulse-width modulated 
output. The consumer units connected to consumer unit shut-down output 1 are the 
following: 

• Storage compartment light 

• Trunk light 

• Reading lights 

In the event of an overload or short circuit, consumer unit shut-down output 1 is switched 
off by the general module 5 unless there is no load connected to the output (open load). 

Once switched off, the output is switched on again by terminal R "OFF/ ON" provided the 
fault (overload or short circuit) is no longer present. 


29 

E85 Central Body Electronics 



Consumer Unit Shut-down 2 (VA2) 

Consumer unit shut-down output 2 is available as a permanent general module 5 output. 

Consumer unit shut-down output 2 is overload and short-circuit proof. The consumer 
units connected to consumer unit shut-down output 2 are the following: 

• Illuminated shifting gate on center console (USA version) 

• Sequential Manual Transmission control unit 

The permanent consumer unit shut-down output 2 is intended for electronic control 
units. The electrical control units require a permanent output as otherwise they would 
not be able to function. 

Sleep Mode 

The preconditions for Sleep mode are the following: 

• Window regulators deactivated for 1 second 

• Consumer unit shut-down and interior lighting passive 

• Diagnostic mode not active 

• K-Bus in Sleep mode 

• On "Go to Sleep Mode" signal after 1 second or within 30 seconds of the anti-theft 
alarm system being armed 

K-Bus Messages 

The K-Bus now contains messages that may be addressed to all or multiple control units. 

Diagnosis 

Consumer Unit Shut-down 

The diagnostic capabilities of the general module 5 have been extended. The general 
module 5 can distinguish between the following load conditions at the consumer unit 
shut-down outputs: 

• Overload 

• Short circuit 

• No load connected (open load) 

The various faults can be diagnosed. 

Consumer unit shut-down output 2 (VA2) is overload and short-circuit proof. An overload 
is detected by the general module 5.

Rear/Brake Light 

The rear-light and brake-light bulbs are in separate compartments in the left and right 
light clusters. When the headlights are switched on, all bulbs in compartments 1 and 3 
are switched on. Those bulbs have a power rating of 21 Watts. For the rear light function, 
all four bulbs are controlled by pulse-width modulation. This dims all four bulbs to 
5 Watts. 

During braking, the light switch center receives a signal from the brake light switch. The 
light switch center then applies 21 Watts to the bulbs in compartment 1. In that way, the 
brake light function is performed. 


Brake Force Display 


In order to improve the reaction of other drivers to an emergency stop, the E85 has a 
Brake Force Display system. Its purpose is to reduce the likelihood of being driven into 
by the vehicle behind. 



1 .Normal Brake Light 
3.Rear Tail Light with BFD 


The Brake Force Display function will only be available on the US version at series launch. 

If a deceleration of more than 5m/s2 or an ABS signal is detected, the bulbs in compart¬ 
ment 3 are activated by the light switch center. They too then receive the full 21 Watts of 
power. In this way, the brake light plus Brake Force Display function is performed. 

Sidemarker Lights 

The US version has two sidemarker lights in the rear plastic bumper panel. 

They are LED light units. 

Bi-xenon Headlights 

The optional bi-xenon headlights represent a major advance in road illumination and 
headlamp range. Their function is identical to the bi-xenon headlights on the E46. 

When the headlights are switched on using the steering column stalk, an electromagnet 
controls a movable beam-pattern screen in the ellipsoid module of the dipped-beam 
headlight. That screen then uncovers the high part of the headlight beam. 

Note: If the headlight flasher function is required, the bi-xenon beam-pattern 
screen is not activated. Only the high-beam headlight (H7) is activated. 
The bi-xenon light reacts too slowly to that signal. 


37 

E85 Central Body Electronics 





Light Switch Center 

The light switch center controls the entire exterior lighting system. The following compo¬ 
nents are integrated in the light switch center, depending on equipment level. 

• Light switch 

• Switch for fog lamps 

• Dimmer control for dashboard, instrument cluster and locator lighting (terminal 58) 

• Photocell for detecting ambient light conditions 

The light switch center has the capability of adjusting the effective voltage at all outputs 
by means of pulse width modulation. With the exception of those for the bi-xenon head¬ 
lights all output voltages are pulse width modulated. 

Control of the effective voltage levels by pulse width modulation allows brightness 
fluctuations due to variations in the load on the vehicle’s electrical system to be evened 
out. The electrical system voltage has to be higher than the desired effective voltage. 

Rain/Light Sensor 

The Rain/Light sensor (RLS) is an addition to the lighting system used to switch the 
headlights on or off automatically based on ambient light conditions. Refer to the wiper 
system section in this training module for more information. 

Interior Lights 
Changes Compared to E46 

The interior lighting is controlled by the general module V. In order to even out the light 
power fluctuations that are made more likely by the use of the NG engines (in future - 
probability of high power draw by Valvetronic electric motors), the voltage for the vehicle 
lights is provided by means of a pulse-width modulated signal with a fixed frequency of 
100 Hz. By varying the pulse width, and thereby the voltage, applied to the light bulbs, 
the fluctuations referred to above can be compensated for. 

The general module V has a fault feedback function. If the power driver in the general 
module V detects the failure of a bulb, the output on the general module V is shut down. 
That means that no power is available at that output any longer. If the defective bulb is 
replaced and terminal R switched OFF/ON, power is available at the general module 
output again. 

The interior door handle lights and center console lights as well as the ambience lights 
in the interior light unit are controlled by the light switch center. 

The storage compartment also has a light. That light has a microswitch and two bulbs.

Principle of Operation 

The Soft-top module IV controls the raising and lowering of the electro-hydraulic soft-top 
in response to the commands from the soft-top control buttons. 

Preconditions for raising/lowering that are detected directly by the Soft-top module IV: 

• Hall-effect sensor 1 for the windshield top-rail lock signals that the windshield 
top-rail lock is disengaged (soft-top unlocked) 

• Hall-effect sensor 2 for the windshield top-rail lock signals that the windshield 
top-rail lock is engaged (soft-top locked), 

• The Hall-effect sensor (for soft-top raised) on the hinge of the main pillar signals 
that the soft-top is raised, or 

• The Hall-effect sensor (for soft-top lowered) on the hinge of the main pillar signals 
that the soft-top is stowed in the stowage compartment 

• The hardtop detector signals that no hardtop is fitted 

• The microswitch of the variable-size stowage compartment indicates that the 
stowage compartment base it at its lowest position 

• The Soft-top module IV has not detected any faults on the system as a whole 
during its internal system test 

Other conditions that are detected indirectly by the Soft-top module IV: 

• Ignition key at position R at least 

• Window not closed 

• Vehicle stationary (road speed < 4 km/h) 

• No short circuit and no circuit break present 

• Outside temperature is not below the limit of approximately. -20°C 

• Soft-top button pressed 

The Soft-top module IV exchanges information via the K-Bus. The Soft-top module IV 
monitors the Hall-effect sensors for plausibility of the signals and correct function. There 
are 2 Hall-effect sensors fitted to the hinge of the main pillar. There are 2 Hall-effect sen¬ 
sors on the front roof bow of the electrohydraulic soft-top. 


42 

E85 Central Body Electronics 



Response to High/Low Voltage 

The voltage range of the Soft-top module IV is 9 V to 16 V. 

Method of operation of soft-top stowage compartment lock 

The soft-top stowage compartment lock holds the soft-top in place when it is fully 
stowed in the compartment. When the soft-top is raised, it locks onto the windshield top 
rail. 

Operation of soft-top stowage compartment lock when lowering soft-top 

When the electro-hydraulic soft-top is fully lowered into the stowage compartment it is 
automatically locked in position. This is effected by the electro-hydraulic soft-top being 
lowered to a position in the stowage compartment where the mechanical locking mecha¬ 
nism engages. 

The Hall-effect sensor on the hinge of the left-hand main pillar signals to the Soft-top 
module IV that the electrohydraulic soft-top is in the fully lowered (stowed) position. The 

locking latches on the electro-hydraulic soft-top are then also engaged. The locking 
latches are controlled by the Soft-top module IV. 

When the electro-hydraulic soft-top is in the fully lowered (stowed) position, the Soft-top 
module IV switches the hydraulic pump off. The relay is switched off by virtue of the fact 
that it is no longer enabled by the Soft-top module IV. 

The electro-hydraulic soft-top is now fully lowered into the stowage compartment. 

Operation of soft-top stowage compartment lock when raising soft-top 

When the electro-hydraulic soft-top is raised, the stowage compartment catch is 
released, the locking latches disengaged and the soft-top raised out of the stowage 
compartment. On the windshield top-rail, the locking latches engage and lock the 
electro-hydraulic soft-top in position. 

Operation of soft-top stowage compartment lock 

The soft-top stowage compartment lock mechanism engages the latches of the fully 
automatic soft-top when it is fully lowered into the stowage compartment.When the fully 
automatic soft-top is raised, the latches are engaged in the windshield top rail. 

The fully automatic soft-top is now fully lowered into the stowage compartment. 

Operation of soft-top control buttons 

The soft-top control buttons for controlling the soft-top UP and DOWN actions are 
switches that connect to ground. Closing the connection to ground signals to the Soft- 
top module 4 that raising or lowering of the fully automatic soft-top has been reguested. 


43 

E85 Central Body Electronics 



Operation of Hall-effect Sensors 

The Hall-effect sensors signal the position (LOCKED or UNLOCKED) of the locking 
latches to the Soft-top module 4. 

Operation of Soft-top Relays 

The Soft-top module 4 controls the relays. The 2 relays for the hydraulic pump are con¬ 
trolled as required (for raising or lowering soft-top) by the Soft-top module 4. 

The relays are wired in such a way that the hydraulic pump action is reversible. The 
relays are controlled by the Soft-top module 4 via High side switches. On a High-side 
switch, the transistor connects positive through. 

Soft-top latch for locking to windshield top rail 

The locking latches are closed when they locate in the windshield top rail. The left and 
right locking latches are closed when they locate in the windshield top rail. The rotation of 
the DC motor is transmitted to spindles. The spindles drive linkages. The action of the 
linkages is transmitted to the locking latches. The locking latches lock/unlock the fully 
automatic soft-top to/from the windshield top rail. 

The position of the locking latches is detected by Hall-effect sensors 1 and 2 

Microswitch for variable-size soft-top stowage compartment 

The microswitch signals to the Soft-top module 4 that the stowage compartment base is 
at its lowest position. The Soft-top module 4 is informed by the microswitch that the 
movable stowage compartment base is at its lowest position. The microswitch is a make- 
switch that connects to earth. 


44 

E85 Central Body Electronics 



GM5 

The general module 5 opens or closes the windows on instruction from the Soft-top 
module 4. The general module 5 stores the current status of trunk and window position. 
The general module 5 places the following information on the K-Bus when it starts up: 

• Current status of trunk and windows 

• Changes to current status of trunk and windows 
Examples of current status information are: 

• Window closed; window open, 

• Trunk closed; trunk open. 

(The signal for the trunk status is present but is not reguired by the Soft-top module 4) 

The general module 5 receives the control commands for raising and lowering the win¬ 
dows from the Soft-top module 4. The Soft-top module 4 sends the control commands 
via the body electronics bus before and after raising/lowering the soft-top. The precondi¬ 
tion for lowering the windows is that at least one window is closed. 

If the windows are already open before the soft-top is raised/lowered, and if one of the 
two soft-top control buttons remains pressed (2 s) after the soft-top has been fully 
raised/lowered, the windows are closed. Closing of the windows is stopped as soon as 
either of the soft-top control buttons is released or the window mechanism detects that 
the window is closed (at limit of movement). 

Soft-top stowage compartment lock 

The locking latches are closed when the soft-top is stowed in the stowage compartment 
and the soft-top locked in position. As soon as the fully automatic soft-top is stowed in 
the stowage compartment, the locking latches close. 


45 

E85 Central Body Electronics 



Notes for Service 


Soft-top module IV time-out function 

If the soft-top control button remains pressed after the soft-top has stopped moving, the 
Soft-top module IV detects a fault. The fault is interpreted as "Short to ground on soft-top 
button or one of the leads" and the fault is recorded in the Soft-top module fault memory. 

However, the electro-hydraulic soft-top can still be moved to a safe parked position using 
the other soft-top control button/ lead, which is still functioning. If the button is released 
while the soft-top is still in motion, the soft-top is stopped (safety function). 

Once the fault has been rectified and terminal R switch off and on again, the electro- 
hydraulic soft-top can be controlled by the soft-top button again. 

Diagnosis 

The diagnostic functions of the Soft-top module IV are to a large degree identical with 
those on the E46. However, fewer signals are analyzed on the E85 than on the E46 
because there are fewer components on the E85. 

Soft-top module 4 internal check 

The internal functions of the Soft-top module 4 are checked under the following 
circumstances: 

• When the power is switched on 

• When terminal R is ON 

• Before the soft-top is raised/lowered 

If a system fault is detected, movement of the soft-top is stopped immediately. The fault 
detected is recorded in the fault memory of the Soft-top module 4. If the nature of the 
fault allows, the soft-top can be moved to the nearest safe parked position using one of 
the soft-top control buttons. 

Control button for raising soft-top 

A short circuit on the control button for raising the soft-top would raise the soft-top. The 
soft-top can still be moved to a safe parked position using the functioning control button 
for lowering the soft-top. 

Control button for lowering soft-top 

A short circuit on the control button for lowering the soft-top would lower the soft-top. To 
prevent the soft-top lowering, the functioning control button for raising the soft-top can 
be used to move the soft-top to a safe parked position. 


46 

E85 Central Body Electronics 



Electric Locking System 

The electric locking system is fitted with an overload protection circuit. The overload pro¬ 
tection circuit has a time-out function as well as the hardware systems. In the event of 
misuse, e.g. while the soft-top is in motion, the time-out function disables the fully auto¬ 
matic soft-top function. After a certain time (when time-out has elapsed) the fully auto¬ 
matic soft-top function is restored. 

Faults on Peripheral Systems 

During the internal check and while the soft-top is being raised/lowered, the signals from 
peripheral systems are checked for plausibility. Those signals must be within the defined 
valid operating ranges. 

Examples of peripheral system signals are: 

• Outside temperature 

• Vehicle stationary signal 

• Signals from the fully automatic soft-top, etc. 

Storage of Faults 

Faults are stored in the order in which they occur. The Soft-top module 4 has up to 16 
"fault storage locations" available in its fault memory. Each fault storage location has a 
frequency counter which counts up to 31. 

Status signals from soft-top module 4 

The Soft-top module 4 supplies the general module 5 and all other bus nodes with the 
current status signals. The Soft-top module 4 provides the following status signals: 

• Reset 

• Status request 

• Ready after reset 

General module 5 window regulator safety function 

The general module 5 stops the windows being closed immediately with the loss of the 
Close windows signal.

Rear Window Heater. 


Rear Window Heater 

The rear window heater cannot be switched on until the relay is enabled according to the 
enabling conditions. 


As with the hardtop, the rear window heater is switched on by the rear window heater 
button. Relays 1 and 2 for the rear window heater pick up, thereby connecting the rear 
window heater to terminal 30. Relay 2 must have been enabled. 

Relay enabling - Relay 2 is enabled by the Basic module 5 which sends a message via 
the K-Bus to the heater control panel.

The general module 5 does not send that message unless the following preconditions 
are satisfied: 

• The Hall-effect sensor on the manual soft-top signals that the soft-top is raised 
and locked to the windshield top rail. 

Hardtop Detection 

Hardtop detection prevents the soft-top being raised when the hardtop is fitted. 

When a hardtop is fitted, the right-hand hardtop locating socket contact is used to detect 
the presence of the hardtop. The hardtop's rear window heater is supplied with power via 
the left-hand hardtop locating socket contacts (right and left). 

Button Lock for Manual Soft-Top 

The button lock is integrated in the central locking system. 

When stowed in the stowage compartment, the soft-top is locked in place by a catch. 
That catch has to be released in order to raise the manual soft-top. The button at the 
top of the bulkhead trim is for releasing the catch. 

Hardtop 

Hardtop Components 

The system consists of the following components: 

• Hardtop 

• Heater control 

• Left and right hardtop locating socket contacts 

• Relay 1 for rear window heater 

• Rear window heater 

Hardtop System Functions 
Rear Window Heater 

The rear window heater is switched on by the rear window heater button. The button is 
fitted in the heater control panel (center console). The button is a make-switch that con¬ 
nects to earth; the LED lights up when the switch is on. 

Relay 1 for the rear window heater picks up, thereby connecting the right-hand hardtop 
locating socket contacts to terminal 30. When the hardtop is fitted, the left-hand hardtop 
locating socket contact is the input (terminal 30) of the rear window heater. The right 
hand hardtop locating socket contact is connected to earth. 

Note: (Rear Window Heater Button) - When the button is pressed in, the LED is 
always on, regardless of whether the rear window heater can actually be 
operated or not.
