Information/Communication 

Introduction 

The E85 has soared to be the new dynamic leader in the market segment of premium 
roadsters. Its breathtaking design and even sportier handling place it distinctly higher than 
the E36/7. 

In keeping with its top-of-the-range status, the Z4 offers new features in the field of infor¬ 
mation and communication systems. 

Radio Systems 

The radios have been redesigned and equipped with a CD drive in line with the vehicle's 
premium status. It features a new central information display radio specifically designed 
for the menu in the central information display. 



Audio Systems 

In addition to the "Hi-Fi" audio systems, a "Top Hi-Fi" system is offered in the Z4. This 
system satisfies the most demanding requirements with regard to sound quality and 
sound impression. This is achieved by the use of Carver low-range speakers or woofers. 
This new speaker technology enables high sound pressures and distortion-free basses in 
conjunction with compact speaker dimensions. 

Telephone Systems 

At this time No factory installed phone systems are available in the Z4. 

Navigation Systems 

A further highlight is the high navigation system. The Z4 is the first BMW roadster 
equipped with a display for presenting maps for the navigation system. The navigation 
information is shown on a central information display located in the middle of the instru¬ 
ment panel. The central information display features a folding function and is folded away 
neatly in the instrument cluster when not in use.

E85 Information and Communication Systems 




Radio and CD changer 

The following radios are available for the E85: 

• BMW Business radio-CD 

• BMW central information display radio CID radio 

All radios are new generation radios (NG radios). The radios feature a K-Bus connection 
via which they communicate with other control units. 



The AF input (audio signals) of the CD changer was increased from 0.5 V to 2.0 V in 
order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The new generation radios detect whether 
they communicate with a 0.5 V CD changer (old) or a 2.0 V CD changer (new) and switch 
over the input accordingly. 

A 6-CD changer is additionally available. A radio with a cassette drive is no longer 
available for the E85. 


Central Information Radio-CD (CID) 



Standard Business Radio-CD 



New Features of the System

Design of the central information display 

The central information display (CID) includes the following components: advanced 
TFT display, crossed-coil motor and mounting with switches. 


• Advanced TFT display - The LC display is designed as a 6.5" advanced TFT 
display. The display is of identical design as the 6.5" display of the on-board monitor 
in the E46. The advanced TFT display adapts automatically to the brightness of the 
ambient light. The display has a visible range of 144 mm x 79.5 mm and a 
resolution of 400 x 240 Pixels. The display is an analog unit and is controlled by 
RGB signals. 

The display is mounted such that it can rotate and is moved by a crossed-coil motor. 

• Crossed-coil motor with gear mechanism (Stepper Motor) - The crossed-coil 
motor is a brushless DC motor. The positions of the display are detected by Hall 
sensors on the gear mechanism. 

• Mounting - The display and the crossed-coil motor are accommodated in a mount¬ 
ing. The mounting is located in the center of the instrument panel so that the same 
component can be used for left-hand drive and right-hand drive vehicles. The 
mounting is screwed flush with the surface of the instrument panel. 

• Switch - Left and right switches are integrated in the trough. The left switches 
serves the purpose of finely setting the display to improve the readability 
corresponding to the seat position and light conditions. The right switch serves to 
fold the display in and out. 


9 

E85 Information and Communication Systems 


















When raised, the position is between 35-108 degrees. The position last stored (last 
function memory position) is raised. The display can now be finely adjusted in steps 
(1 step = 1.2 degrees) using the left-hand switch. The signal from the switch is sent 
directly to the stepper motor and is not transferred via the K-Bus. 

Manual fine adjustment of the display is also possible in a range from 35-108 degrees. In 
an area below this range (< 35 degrees), the CID is closed automatically as it can no 
longer be read effectively in this position. The right-hand switch can be used to close the 
display. 

Navigation directions are not interrupted if the display is closed while the navigation 
system is active. When terminal R is switched off, the CID is always closed and the last 
position stored. The display can be switched off by means of a button in the main menu. 

If the display is closed manually or electrically while driving, the display will remain closed 
at the start of the next trip (last function memory position). The display must first be raised 
again by pressing the switch. 

CD Changer 

The optional CD changer is the same 6-CD 
changer as fitted on the E46. The CD chang¬ 
er is adapted to the new generation radios 
and features a 2.0 V AF output. 

The CD changer is located in the lockable 
compartment in the center of the partition. 

The compartment is locked with the central 
locking system.

FM Aerial in Bumper 

The FM aerial consists of a 73 cm long line. The FM aerial is mounted in the bumper on 
adjustable clips. The FM aerial is adapted precisely to the vehicle. For this reason, no 
changes must be made to the aerial. The FM aerial is connected to an aerial amplifier. 



Aerial Diversity 

In the E85, 2 physical aerials are connected to the radio aerial diversity, i.e. the rod aerial 
and the aerial in the bumper. The aerial diversity function switches over to another aerial 
as soon as the system undershoots a defined threshold. Changeover takes place in such 
a way that no interruption can be heard. Depending on the reception situation, reception 
on both aerials simultaneously is also possible.

E85 Information and Communication Systems 























Audio Systems 

The following audio systems are available for the E85: 

• Hi-Fi audio system 

• Top Hi-Fi audio system 

New Features 

For the first time at BMW, binding audio standards have been defined for the E85 which 
will also be adopted in successor models. In addition to the minimum reguirements relat¬ 
ing to the systems, Carver speaker technology is used for the first time worldwide in a 
motor vehicle (Top Hi-Fi audio system). This system achieves substantial improvements 
in the low freguency range. 

The audio standards stipulate the following reguirements: 

• Classification in 2 audio systems: Hi-Fi and Top Hi-Fi 

• Symmetry of sound field: All systems ensure uniform distribution of the sound field 
in the vehicle and convey the overall acoustic impression that the source of the 
music is in front of the driver and passenger. 

• Sound pressure 

• Linearity of stereo signal 

With the aid of the Carver speaker technology, high sound pressures can be achieved 
although there is only a low resonance volume (space behind the speakers) available in 
the roadster. 

System Comparison - Sound Pressure 

The sound pressure in the vehicle is the measure for establishing the total volume up to 
which distortion-free sound reproduction is possible. 

The higher the sound pressure the greater the volume. When the sound pressure is 
increased by approximately. 10 dB, the volume is subjectively doubled.

Carver Woofer Operating Principle 

High sound pressure is required for achieving a rich bass. The Carver woofers (low-range 
speakers) produce this sound pressure with their small diameter by increasing the 
displacement of the diaphragm. The sound pressure is produced by movement in the 
volume of air. 

The volume of air moved is derived from the diaphragm area multiplied by the displace¬ 
ment. To date to achieve this, the largest possible diaphragm area (diameter of the 
speaker) was used in conjunction with relatively low displacement (approximately. 3-10 
mm). A matching resonance volume is additionally required. 

In vehicle construction applications, this technology leads to a conflict between vehicle 
design and vehicle equipment: Due to the design and comprehensive level of equipment, 
there is little package space available for large bass speakers. 

Carver technology represents a new approach in solving this problem. Thanks to Carver 
technology, a high sound pressure is produced with a small speaker diameter by increas¬ 
ing the diaphragm displacement (approximately. 30 mm). 

Due to the greater diaphragm displacement Carver woofers (low-range speakers) require 
a higher voltage supply than conventional speakers. 

A special DSP amplifier with high voltage output stages (30 Vrms) is required for the Top 
Hi-Fi audio system. It is necessary to greatly increase the magnetic force in order to 
achieve greater diaphragm displacement. The solenoid was adapted accordingly. A high 
magnetic force also means that a high back emf is produced in the solenoid (back emf 
Uemf=B.l.v). 

The back emf counteracts the output voltage of the amplifier thus reducing the effective 
voltage at the solenoid. 

It is not possible to operate Carver speakers with the amplifiers (radio output stages 
6 Vrms) previously used.

E85 Information and Communication Systems 



Principle of Operation 

All audio systems are controlled via the radio. The differences between the systems are 
in the control of the amplifiers. The Hi-Fi and Top Hi-Fi amplifiers do not feature direct 
control functions. 

Hi-Fi Amplifier 

The Hi-Fi amplifier is controlled via the radio. 

The required settings are selected in the radio and output via 4 radio outputs to the 
amplifier. The amplifier amplifies the settings and distributes them over 10 channels. 

No variable matching takes place in the Hi-Fi amplifier. Vehicle-specific equalizing is inte¬ 
grated in the Hi-Fi amplifier. 

The following functions can be set in the radio: 

• Volume 

• Bass 

• Treble 

• Balance (left/right) 

• Fader (front/rear) 

• Loudness 

• Speed-dependent volume control 

Top Hi-Fi Amplifier 

The Top Hi-Fi amplifier is also controlled via the radio. The Top Hi-Fi amplifier receives a 
constant audio signal for the left and right (via the two audio inputs) from the radio. The 
required settings are transferred via the K-Bus and formed in the amplifier. 

The following functions can be set: 

• Volume 

• Bass 

• Treble 

• Balance (left/right) 

• Fader (front/rear) 

In addition, the overall acoustics can be set individually (CID only) by means of a 7-band 
graphic equalizer. 


25 

E85 Information and Communication Systems 




Improved Overall Acoustic Impression 

With the aid of software, adaptations were implemented in the Top Hi-Fi amplifier for the 
purpose of improving the overall acoustic impression. 

The following adaptations in the amplifier are conducted automatically: 

• Loudness 

• Speed-dependent volume control 

• Vehicle-specific egualizing 

• Dynamic egualizing 

• Dynamic compression 

• Internal temperature monitoring 

Loudness 

To improve the listening nuance, the low freguencies are raised slightly at low volume 
settings. 

Speed-dependent Volume Control 

The volume is raised as the driving speed increases. 6 characteristic curves are available 
for this purpose. The characteristics can be set individually in the service functions. 

Vehicle-specific Equalizing 

The acoustics are matched to the vehicle interior. 

Dynamic Equalizing 

The acoustics are adapted to increasing driving noise. 

Dynamic Compression 

The dynamics must be compressed to avoid overloading the system. The upper level of 
effective dynamics is limited by the output power of the amplifier and the load capacity of 
the speakers. For this reason, the speed-dependent volume cannot be increased 
infinitely, 

Internal Temperature Monitoring 

In the event of excessively high temperature, the output of the output stages is reduced in 
order to cool them. The temperature of the output stages is permanently monitored. 

Notes for Service 

Diagnosis 

No diagnosis functions are provided for the audio systems. 

Coding 

No variant coding functions are provided for the audio systems. 

Car & Key Memory 

No functions are available for the car & key memory.

E85 Information and Communication Systems 




Central Information Display 

The central information display is the display unit for the High navigation system. The dis¬ 
play is designed as a 6.5" advanced TFT display for presenting the operating interface 
and maps. 

To optimize the legibility, the display can be precision adjusted by means of a switch. 

The central information display is located in the center of the instrument panel above the 
ventilation outlet. 



CID Control Panel 

The central information display is located in the center of the instrument panel below the 
ventilation outlet. 

The functions presented in the CID can be controlled with the rotary push-button on the 
right and the menu key on the CID control panel. 

Navigation Computer DVD 

The navigation computer is located in the lockable compartment between the seats in 
the partition between the vehicle interior and luggage compartment. The navigation 
computer DVD incorporates the main functions for the navigation system and contains 
the following components: 

• DVD drive for reading information of the digitized road maps on DVD or CD 

• GPS receiver for determining position before start of journey 

• Yaw rate sensor for calculating position while driving 

• Powerful processor for fast calculation of data 

• Memory modules for buffering data 

• Interfaces for communication with other systems and evaluating sensor data 

• Interfaces for outputting image data and voice information 

• GPS aerial 


29 

E85 Information and Communication Systems 









GPS Aerial 


The GPS aerial receives the signals from GPS satellites and transfers the data (degrees 
longitude, degrees latitude, Greenwich meantime (GMT)) to the GPS receiver in the navi¬ 
gation computer DVD for the purpose of calculating the position. This is of particular 
importance during initial or re-initialization of the system. These data are also read in dur¬ 
ing the restart procedure. 

The GPS aerial is located in the middle of the roof frame behind the interior lamp. 

Wheel Speed Sensor 

The wheel speed sensor determines the rotary motion of the wheel. The information is 
routed to the ABS/DSC control unit and the corresponding distance calculated. The 
conditioned signal is then made available to the navigation computer. The ABS sensor at 
the rear left is used for the purpose of determining the speed signal. 

Reverse Light Switch 

With the aid of the reverse light switch, the navigation system detects whether reverse 
gear is engaged. On manual transmission vehicles, the reverse light switch is located in 
the manual gearbox. On automatic vehicles, the reverse signal comes from the selector 
lever switch.

E85 Information and Communication Systems 



Principle of Operation 

The navigation computer DVD represents a further-development of the MK-3 computer. 
The computing capacity of the navigation computer DVD has been doubled (from previ¬ 
ously 54 MHz to 108 MHz). Likewise, the capacity of the memory modules has been 
enlarged and a new flash module integrated to allow for considerably faster flashing (from 
previously 15.6 MIPS to 70.0 MIPS, million instructions per second). 

The previous functions of the MK-3 computer have been fully adopted. Only the new or 
modified functions are outlined in the following section. 

The following functions are new: 

• Additional destination inputs 

• More accurate calculation of arrival time 

• Improved direction 

• Improved map presentation on the CID 

• New map presentations 

• Digitized road maps on DVD 

The following new destination inputs are possible: 

• Direct input of border crossing points 

• Address book extended to 100 entries (20) 

• Storage of last 20 destinations (10) 

More accurate calculation of arrival time 

The expected time of arrival is calculated more accurately by including the average vehi¬ 
cle speed corresponding to the type of road. 

For this purpose, the average speed of the last 7 minutes is stored corresponding to the 
type of road (highway, major trunk road, district road). Based on the selected route, the 
computer calculates the share of different types of road and the determined average 
speed so it can calculate the arrival time more accurately. 

Improved Direction 

When changing from one highway to another, the number of the new roadway is 
announced (voice information). 

Improved Map Presentation on the CID 

In future, the maps will be presented in up to 256 colors. The indicator for the current 
position has been enlarged. 


31 

E85 Information and Communication Systems 



New Map Presentations 

The scaling of the maps has been extended to 1000 miles. The scales 200 miles, 500 
miles and 1000 miles have been additionally introduced. As a result, all the USA can be 
shown on the display. The selected route is highlighted in white. 

In addition, 3 maps can be shown in different scales. 

The following scales can be presented: 

• The scale bar on the display corresponds to 1000 miles 

• The scale bar on the display corresponds to 500 miles 

• The scale bar on the display corresponds to 200 miles 

The 200 miles, 500 miles and 1000 miles scales can only be presented in connection 

with DVD maps. The previous CD maps only provide scales of up to 100 miles. 

The map scales are selected in the "Settings" menu under "Announcement." 

Digitized Maps on DVD 

The navigation computer DVD is equipped with a DVD drive. The navigation computer 
DVD is retro-compatible and can be used in all MK-x systems. It can also read the 
previously used CDs. 

Operation 

The High navigation system is controlled by selecting the "GPS navigation" menu in the 
main menu of the central information display. 

Basic settings are possible under the menu item “Settings” in the main menu to adapt 
the display to country specific requirements. The various settings can be carried out in 
the windows. The red markings correspond to the current settings. 

With the “Screen” menu item in the Settings menu it is possible to switch between full 
and split screen. 

As a result, it is possible to show the map and the navigation arrow simultaneously. 

Navigation is represented with arrows while in split screen or using the OBC functions. 

The mask for entering the destination is accessed after selecting the "GPS navigation" 
menu. A submenu is selected by pressing the rotary push-button on the CID control 
panel. 

In the "Announcement" menu, the last voice announcement is repeated by pressing the 
button. By pressing the button for longer than 2 seconds, the announcement is deacti¬ 
vated or activated depending on the setting.
