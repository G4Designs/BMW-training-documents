K-Bus 

The K-bus links the components of the general vehicle electrical system, the information 
and communications systems and the safety system. The majority of the systems and 
components has been taken from other models and adapted to the E83. 

A new feature is the control system for the new panorama sunroof (MDS) and the safety 
system (MRS4RD). 

The satellite radio (SDARS) has been adapted to the connection to the K-bus. 

The data transfer rate is 9.6 kbit. 

PT-CAN 

The PT-CAN links the components of the control units for the drive and chassis systems. 
Newly incorporated is the VG-SG control unit for the transfer case. 

The data transfer rate is 500 kbit. 

Diagnosis Bus 

The diagnosis bus is connected with two leads to the overall bus system. The PIN 7 
diagnostic connector lead is directed to the DME and transfers all the emissions-related 
data from the engine management system and from the automatic gearbox. 

The PIN 8 diagnostic connector is connected to the remaining control units either directly 
or via the instrument cluster as gateway. 

The data transfer rate is 9.6 kbit. The rate of transfer of emissions related data 
KWP2000* (E-OBD and OBD) is 10.4 kbit. 

Sub-Bus Systems 

The following sub-buses are used in the E83: 

• BSD Bit-serial data interface - connection of electronic engine management and 
alternator 

• LIN Local Interconnected Network - connection of AHL and bi-xenon headlights, 
connection of GM5 and driver's or door mirror switch block 

• M-bus - connection of IHKA/IHKR and stepper motors

General Vehicle Electrical 


Power Supply 
Battery 

Different vehicle batteries with different capacities are used depending on the engine and 
equipment specification. The battery is located in the luggage compartment in the 
spare-wheel recess. 

Battery Lead 

The E83 has different battery leads depending on the engine variant. The B+battery 
cable is routed through the interior of the X3, along the floor on the passenger side. The 
B+ cable is made of aluminum and has a diameter of 80mm 2 . 

Fuses 

The E83 is equipped with two fuse holders. The luggage compartment fuse holder with 
the fuse of the front fuse holder is located next to the vehicle battery in the spare wheel 
recess. 

The glovebox fuse holder carries the majority of the fuses. The main fuses for the DME 
and the ignition/starter switch are located on the rear side of the glovebox fuse holder. 

The luggage compartment houses the vehicle battery and the luggage compartment 
fuse holder. The luggage compartment fuse holder supplies the glovebox fuse holder.

Energy Management 

Energy management for the E83 is taken from the E46. The software for regulating the 
charging voltage is in the DME. In the event of an increased current consumption in the 
vehicle electrical system, the charging voltage specification can be increased. The charg¬ 
ing voltage specification is issued by the DME via the bit-serial data interface to the alter¬ 
nator. 

The charging voltage can be regulated as a function of the outside temperature. Thus the 
battery can be charged to optimum effect. At low temperatures, the charging voltage can 
be increased to obtain a higher capacity. At high temperatures, the charging voltage is 
reduced to avoid excessive gassing. The maximum charging voltage is 14.8 V. 

A battery change does not have to be communicated to the DME control unit. 

Energy management also features the option of load/consumer shutdown. In the event of 
excessive current consumption in the vehicle, the power output of the heated rear 
window can be reduced. 

Starter Control 

EWS III plus is used in the E83. The basic function of starter control and enabling of DME 
and EGS has remained the same. With EWS III plus the terminal 50 information is for¬ 
warded not from the starter motor but rather directly from the EWS control unit to the 
instrument cluster. A circuit is hard-wired from the output of the starter relay in the EWS 
III plus control unit directly to the instrument cluster. In order to avoid erroneous mea¬ 
surements, no sensor values are stored during the starting process.

General Vehicle Electrical 


Introduction 

The general vehicle electrical system of the E83 is for the most part based on the central 
body electronics 5 ZKE 5 of the E46. 

The functions of the general vehicle electrical system are comparable to those of the 
general vehicle electrical system on the E46: 

• Central locking 

• Power windows, different to the E46 

• Wipe/wash system 

• Anti-theft alarm system 

• Interior Lights 

• Consumer shutdown 

• Remote control operation 

• Door mirror control 

• Car and Key Memory 

The GM5RD communicates with the following components on the LIN bus: 

• Door mirror, driver 

• Door mirror, passenger side 

• Switch block, driver 

The stored positions of the door mirrors are lost if the GM5RD is replaced. 

GM5 Redesign 

The General Module 5 Redesign (GM5RD) is the heart of the general vehicle electrical 
system. The GM5RD, which was used on the E85, has been further developed for the 
E83 with a combined K-/LIN bus module. The K-/LIN bus module is integrated in the 
GM5RD for operation of the door mirrors. 

Power Windows 

The power windows of the E83 are controlled by the GM5RD similar to the operation in 
the E46. The anti-trapping feature has been modified and the anti-trap strip is not used 
in the E83. Anti-trapping is provided by the EKS electronics included in the individual 
window motors. 

The SBFA (drivers door switch block assembly) is connected to the GM5RD via the LIN 
Bus. The passenger door switch and both rear door switch assemblies are connected 
directly via hard-ware to the GM5RD.

Wiper Relay 

The dual relay is located in the E-Box. 

SRA Relay 

The SRA (headlight washing system) relay is located in the glove box fuse carrier. 

Heated Wiper Nozzles 

The heating element of the front washer nozzles are switched by an inline ambient tem¬ 
perature sensor via terminal 15. The current draw of the heating elements is controlled 
by a PTC resistor as a function of temperature. 

Headlight Washer System 

The headlight washer system is switched on and off using the windshield washer switch. 

The GM5RD switches the headlight washer pump on if terminal 58g is active, every fifth 
time the windshield is washed. 

Rear Window Wiper 

The rear window wiper is controlled by the rear wiper module. The rear wiper module is 
the same as used on the E46 sportwagon. 

Door Mirrors 

There are two door mirror versions fitted to the E83. The low version(standard) door mir¬ 
rors have the following functions: 

• Electric mirror adjustment 

• Mirror heating 

The high version (optional) door mirrors have the following functions: 

• Electric mirror adjustment 

• Mirror heating 

• Mirror folding 

All mirror functions for both exterior mirrors are controlled by the GM5RD. The GM5RD 
makes all decisions concerning mirror movement and passes instructions to the mirror 
electronics (contained in the mirrors) via the LIN bus. 

Potentiometers in the mirror electronics monitor position. Current position is sent to the 
GM5RD on a cyclical basis, and last mirror position is stored in the GM5RD. 

The mirror switch in the SBFA communicates with the GM5RD via the LIN bus.

The Predrive Check is a test of important indicator and warning lamps. In the Predrive 
Check, these indicator and warning lamps are activated for 2 seconds with terminal 15 
"ON". All the indicator and warning lamps are deactivated at the end of the Predrive 
Check. 

The following indicator and warning lamps are activated in the Predrive Check: 

• Fuel reserve 

• Coolant over-temperature 

• Fasten seat belt (country-specific) 

• Brake-lining wear 

• General brake warning light (1 second yellow, 1 second red) 

• RDW (1 second yellow, 1 second red) 

• Oil pressure/oil level (1 second yellow, 1 second red) 

• Gearbox limp-home program 

• Washer fluid 

• Lamp fault (Check Control) 

• Battery charge 

LC Display 

The LC display is integrated in the speedometer. The LC display indicates the kilometer 
reading/mileage and time as well as the on-board computer functions. The service inter¬ 
val indicator is also shown in the LC display. 

A tampering dot indicates if there are different vehicle identification numbers in the light 
switch cluster and in the instrument cluster. 

The LC display is made up of orange-colored segment characters(similarto a dot matrix). 
The brightness of the display is determined by the light switch cluster. 


The LC display is activated with terminal R "ON". 



22 

E83 Electronic Systems 




Program and Gear Display 

On vehicles fitted with an automatic gearbox, the program and gear display is featured in 
a separate LC display. The LC display is located between the speedometer and the rev 
counter. The program and gear display is activated with terminal 15 "ON". 




1. Transmission Program Mode 

2. Transmission range (PRND etc) 


The LC display for the program and gear display is made up of orange colored segments 
(dot matrix). The brightness of the display is determined by the light switch cluster. 

The information between the control units for the automatic gearbox and the instrument 
cluster is exchanged on the PT-CAN bus. A separate indicator lamp (see warning and 
indicator lamps) indicates the gearbox limp-home program in the event of a fault in the 
electronic transmission control. 


The program and gear display shows letters and numbers. The program mode is dis¬ 
played on the left and the drive position on the right. 


Control Buttons 

Two control buttons are located between 
the 2 large needle instruments. The left 
button (S/R for Set/Reset) is used to reset 
the trip-odometer reading, to call up the 
test functions and to call up the reset 
menu for the service interval indicator. 

The right button (clock symbol) is used to 
set the time and to switch the service 
interval indicator (remaining distance/ser¬ 
vice date or vice versa).

E83 Electronic Systems 










On-Board Computer 

The on-board computer functions are indicated in the bottom line of the LC display. The 
software used in the instrument cluster of the E83 is the same as that used in the E85. 

All the functions are identical and are described in the vehicle documentation for the E85. 

The displays of the on-board computer can be displayed and scrolled through in the 
instrument cluster using the button in the turn indicator and High beam switch. 

Test Functions 

The test functions are used by service mechanics to check the coding. The test functions 
are also tools for fault finding without a diagnostic tester. The test functions are only 
shown in the LC display of the instrument cluster. The test functions are activated by 
pressing the left control button in the instrument cluster (S/R, 5 seconds) with terminal R 
or terminal 15 "ON". 

In addition, the test functions can still be called up by pressing the left control button S/R 
for Set/Reset) in the instrument cluster with simultaneous activation of terminal R. 

Locking and Unlocking Test Functions 

Only the first two test functions are freely accessible. All test functions after the third test 
function are locked. Unlocking can only be carried out removed by means of test function 
19. In test function 19, the display switches in intervals of 1 second from L_on to L_off 
(Lock on and Lock off). The test functions are unlocked or locked by pressing the left 
control button (S/R for Set/Reset). 

If the left control button (S/R for Set/Reset) in the instrument cluster is pressed while 
L_off is displayed, the test functions remain unlocked or are unlocked. The display jumps 
to test function 0. 

If the left control button (S/R for Set/Reset) in the instrument cluster is pressed while 
L_on is displayed, the test functions remain locked or are locked. The test functions can 
be locked by means of test function 19. 

Diagnosis 

There are three possible combinations for replacing the instrument cluster/light switch 
cluster: 

• Instrument cluster faulty, light switch cluster OK 

• Light switch cluster faulty, instrument cluster OK 

• Light switch cluster and instrument cluster must be replaced 

Simultaneous replacement of the light switch cluster and the instrument cluster must be 
avoided. The odometer reading will be lost. In principle it is also possible to carry out a 
trial replacement of the instrument cluster/light switch cluster.

Information and Communication 

The BMWX3 is a premium vehicle in the SAV (Sports Activity Vehicle) range. The X3 
information and communication systems also offer current technology which meets the 
highest standards. For example, DVD navigation with color screen, Bluetooth telephone 
technology (not at SOP) and audio systems with digital sound improvement are all 
offered in the X3. 


Radio and CD Changer 

The radios in the E83 are identical to those in the E85 except for the color of the front fin¬ 
isher panel. The controls and functional efficiency also correspond to those of the E85 
radio systems. 

The E83 does come with a BMW Business Radio w/CD as Standard. 


Additionally available is the BMW Central Information Display CID radio w/ navigation. 

All radios are new generation radios (NG radios). The radios feature a K-bus connection 
via which they communicate with other control units. Radios with a cassette deck are no 
longer available. 


A 6-CD changer is also available for the E83. The CD changer audio signals have a level 
of 2.0 V (increased interference voltage distance). New generation radios detect whether 
they are communicating with a 0.5 V CD changer (old) or a 2.0 V CD changer (new) and 
switch over the input accordingly. 



The BMW Business Radio with CD comes with the Hifi Audio system as standard. The 
Top Hifi system is optional as is the 6-disc CD changer. 


The CID radio with Navigation comes with the Hifi Audio system as standard. The Top 
Hifi system is optional as is the 6-disc CD changer.

CD Changer 

The CD changer is a standard 6 disc CD 
changer as fitted on the E46. The CD 
changer is suitable for the new generation 
radios (2.0 V audio output). 

CDC Location 

For the first time in a BMW model, the CD 
changer is located in a user friendly position 
between the driver's seat and front passen¬ 
ger's seat in the front armrest (optional). 

The snap-in adapter for the mobile phone 
is housed in a flap above the CD changer. 



Aerial System 

The E83 has up to 6 aerial systems depending on the options installed, 
not including the aerial for the remote control services (FBD). 

The E83 features the following aerial systems: 

• FM 1 - 3 window aerials in the rear window 

• FM aerial 4 in the rear spoiler 

• AM aerial in the rear spoiler 

• Telephone aerial (roof-mounted aerial) 

• GPS aerial for the navigation system (roof-mounted aerial)

AM and FM Aerials 

The aerial structures for the FM aerials 1 - 3 are integrated in the rear window. The rear 
window is made of toughened safety glass (ESG) and is approximately 3.1 mm thick. 

The AM aerial is in the rear spoiler. To avoid disturbances in AM reception through the 
third brake light in the rear spoiler, there is a suppressor filter in the feed line to the third 
brake light. 

The power supply to the AM and FM aerial amplifier comes from the radio via terminal 
Rad_on.

Audio Systems 

The various audio systems of the E83 are described in this technical documentation. 

The radio systems originate from the E85. The loudspeaker systems are new develop¬ 
ments and are adapted to the acoustic and technical dimension requirements of the E83. 

The E83 is available with the HiFi audio system and standard equipment and the Top 
HiFi audio system as an option. 

The BMW audio standards which have been applied since the E85 are also being applied 
to the E83. They apply to the HiFi and Top HiFi systems with regard to symmetry of the 
sound field, sound pressure and linearity of the frequency response. 

New Features 

New features by comparison with the E85: 

• Central woofers for the HiFi and Top HiFi audio systems are fitted. The central bass 
principle applies to the systems in the E65/E60. 

• The HiFi amplifier in the E83 luggage compartment is a modified version of the HiFi 
amplifier from the E85/E46. A 6 channel amplifier is adapted from the 10 channel hifi 
amplifier via internal switch changes. 

• A fuse is added to the Carver Top HiFi amplifier from the E85 but is otherwise 
installed in the E83 without further modifications. 

HiFi System 

The HiFi audio system features a 6 channel analog amplifier that is connected directly to 
the 4 speaker outputs of the radio. The loudspeakers are connected to the 6 HiFi 
amplifier output channels. The tweeters are protected from overload by capacitors in the 
supply lead and connected in parallel to the broadband speakers. 

All sound controlling functions such as volume, bass, treble, fader, and GAL are per¬ 
formed in the radio. 

HiFi Amplifier 

The 6 channel HiFi amplifier in the luggage compart¬ 
ment of the E83 is a modified version of the 10 chan¬ 
nel HiFi amplifier from the E85/E46. Four channels are 
for the door loudspeakers (broad-band loudspeaker or 
broadband speaker with additional tweeter) and 2 
channels are for the central woofers. 

The housing is constructed in the same way as the 10 
channel HiFi amplifier in the E85/E46. The HiFi amplifi¬ 
er has on output of 4 x 25 watts for the mid-range and 
high-ranges and 2 x 40 watts for the low frequency.

Top HiFi Audio System 

The Top HiFi audio system features a 10 channel amplifier with DSP technology for 
sound control. The Top HiFi amplifier is controlled via the two radio analog audio signals. 

The Top HiFi amplifier features a digital input for the CD changer. The digital input is only 
used for the BMW Business CD radio and CD changer combination. The 10 loudspeak¬ 
ers are directly connected to the 10 output channels of the Top HiFi amplifier. The active 
frequency gates for adaptation of the loudspeakers are built into the amplifier. 

Depending on the radio, various functions can be called up. Sound control functions such 
as volume, bass, treble, fader, GAL, spatial sound simulation etc. are formed in the Top 
HiFi amplifier. The 7 band graphic equalizer can only be used in connection with the CID 
radio. 

Top HiFi Amplifier 

A fuse is added to the familiar Carver Top HiFi 
amplifier from the E85 but is otherwise installed 
in the E83 without further modifications. 

However, special Carver woofers with increased 
cone excursion are used in the E83. The space 
available in the E83 and the resonance volume in 
the side sill enables the use of the central bass 
principle. 

The central woofers in the Top HiFi audio system 
are simply adapted to the increased voltage level 
of the bass end levels (8 Ohm impedance). The 
amplifier delivers 6 x 20 watts, 2 x 40 watts and 
2 x 100 watts. 

SPDIF 

The digital connection between the Top HiFi 
amplifier and the CD changer is an SPDIF con¬ 
nection. SPDIF stands for Sony Philips Digital 
Interface and is a data transfer standard for digital 
audio data. The data can be transferred optically 
via fibre-optic cables or via coaxial cables 
depending on the unit. 

Advantage: the digital data is read by the CD and 
transferred between the units with the highest 
possible quality, as no digital/analog conversion is 
necessary. The Top HiFi amplifier also no longer 
has to carry out analog/digital conversion. The 
digital data can therefore be processed directly 
from the DSP (Digital Sound Processor).

Telephone System 


The Everest platform for the telephone and telematics functions are used in the US ver¬ 
sion of the E83. For the American market, three different versions are offered: 

• TCU only with telematics function emergency call (E-Call) and breakdown call 
(B-Call). Optional w/Premium Package 

• TCU with telematic function emergency call and enabling by provider. 

• TCU with telematics and telephone functions via hands-free unit or mobile phone 
(after retrofitting a telephone). 

Telematic Control Unit TCU 

The Telematic Control Unit TCU is optional equipment in US vehicles. This means that 
an emergency call can always be made(if the car is equipped with the TCU), also if the 
customer has not (yet) retrofitted a telephone. 

The range of functions of the US version is as follows: 

• TCU is always fitted in order to ensure the emergency call can be made even 
if no telephone is present 

• Dual-band 800 MHz and 1900 MHz 

• Combined transmit/receive module NAD (Network Access Device) for analog AMPS 
(American Mobile Phone Standard) for telephone calls and digital CDMA (Code 
Division Multiplex Algorithm) for telematics functions 

• Eject box with charging unit for Motorola Phoenix V60 

• Telematics functions (E/B call) 

• GPS receiver for localization 

Principle of Operation 

In the US version, the Telematic Control Unit has a NAD (Network Access Device) that 
works in the AMPS/CDMA standard with the frequencies 800/1900 MHz. The TCU fea¬ 
tures a hands-free system with full-duplex transmission. This makes it possible to speak 
and listen simultaneously. The position of the vehicle is determined by the TCU by means 
of a built-in GPS receiver. In the event of a crash, the TCU sends an SMS with this loca¬ 
tion data to the provider. Furthermore, the TCU has an interface for the connection of an 
emergency call button (E/B Call). The emergency call button is a dual function switch 
with two keys: one for the emergency call and one for the breakdown call. The emer¬ 
gency call button is standard equipment.

Compensator 


The compensator is connected in the aerial cable between the telephone and the roof 
aerial. It balances out the losses of the aerial cable. The compensator is fitted in the lug¬ 
gage compartment on the separating wall to the left of the TCU. 



GPS Aerial 

The GPS aerial permanently receives data regarding the current latitude and longitude 
from the satellites of the Global Positioning System, GPS. This data is transferred to the 
GPS receiver in the TCU, which uses it to determine each position of the vehicle. The 
GPS aerial is integrated in the roof aerial.
