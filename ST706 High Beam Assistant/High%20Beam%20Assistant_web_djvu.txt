High Beam Assistant 


Introduction 


The high beam assistant (FLA) assists the driver in the use of the high beam headlight. 
The high beam assistant will be offered as an option: SA 5AC. 

Corresponding to the traffic situation, the high beam assistant switches the vehicle's 
high beam headlight on and off, thus relieving the driver of the task of operating the high 
beam headlight. High beam can still be switched on and off manually as usual. 

Note: The high beam assistant is an assistance function so that the driver 
always has the option and duty to override the system when the road 
situation so requires. 


Only the high beam of the xenon headlight is controlled on vehicles 
equipped with the high beam assistant. The halogen high beam head¬ 
lights are switched on only with the headlight flasher. 


The system consists of an image sensor (special camera for detecting light sources in 
road traffic) and an FLA control unit. High beam and low beam are still switched by the 
lights module. The lights module determines whether high beam can be switched on 
based on a range of various input variables.

FLA Control Unit 


The image sensor is located behind the base of the interior rear-view mirror. The FLA 
control unit is installed directly on the back of the mirror glass in the interior rear-view 
mirror. 

During operation, the image sensor registers points of light that are subsequently evalu¬ 
ated in the FLA control unit. The image sensor can distinguish between various parame¬ 
ters such as light color and light intensity. 

When it determines reasons for deactivating high beam, the FLA control unit sends a 
deactivation recommendation to the lights module. Otherwise an activation recommen¬ 
dation is sent. 

The high beam is switched off in following situations: 

• Oncoming/Preceding traffic 

• Street lamps (e.g. urban areas,...) 

• Ambient brightness too high (e.g. twilight,...) 

• Driving speed too low

High Beam Assistant 













Oncoming Traffic 

In connection with oncoming traffic, the 
high beam assistant must be able to dis¬ 
tinguish between reflective traffic signs, 
other light sources and the headlights 
of oncoming vehicles. 

The detection range is approximately 
1000 meters. 


Preceding Traffic 

Although the tail lights of preceding 
vehicles are often illuminated relatively 
weakly compared to other light sources, 
the FLA must still be able to reliably 
detect a vehicle at a distance of approxi¬ 
mately 400 meters.

High Beam Assistant 






Various Lighting Situations 

The FLA sends a switch-on recommen¬ 
dation to the lights module also in 
response to many non-specific light 
sources (traffic signs, road markings, 
lane demarcation elements, etc.) in the 
detection range of the high beam assis¬ 
tant. High beam is switched on and the 
high beam assistant indicator lamp is 
activated. 



Adequate Light Levels 

The high beam assistant sends a switch- 
off recommendation to the lights module 
when the vehicle is in surroundings with 
adequate light and lighting levels. 

Such conditions may be: 

• Daylight 

• Twilight 

• Illuminated places 

• Street lights

High Beam Assistant 





System Limits 

Under certain conditions, the high beam assistant may send deactivation or activation 
recommendations to the lights module that may not appear logical to the driver. 

The system can reach its functional limits in following situations: 

• Extremely unfavorable weather conditions (e.g. fog) 

• Poorly illuminated road users (e.g. riders on small motorcycles, cyclists, pedestrians) 

• Individual driving situations (e.g. sharp bends, steep brows and hollows of hills, traffic 
coming at right angles from left or right) 

Traffic Signs 

Due to their appearance and height, certain traffic 
signs are very difficult to distinguish from headlights. 

Particularly traffic signs indicating a sharp bend 
cannot always be interpreted correctly by the high 
beam assistant. 

Under certain circumstances, the high beam assistant may interpret the reflective red 
areas in this example as tail lights. 

Bends and Brow of Hills 

In dark conditions, the driver recognizes oncoming vehicles at a distance even before 
bends and brows of hills. 

The light beam of an oncoming vehicle is already visible before the headlights can be 
made out. The high beam assistant, on the other hand, can only recognize an oncoming 
vehicle when the headlights can actually be detected as light sources. 

A bright light on the horizon does not result in the high beam assistant sending a switch- 
off recommendation.

System Components 


High Beam Assistant Control Unit 

Design of Interior Rear-view Mirror 

The entire hardware of the high beam assistant is installed in the interior rear-view mirror. 
The hardware consists of an image sensor mounted in the mirror base as well as elec¬ 
tronic evaluator circuitry in the interior rear-view mirror. A special mirror base, on which 
the image sensor is mounted, is required for the high beam assistant. 

The high beam assistant also consists of a cover for the image sensor and the sensors 
already installed (rain/driving lights sensor and condensation sensor).

Image Sensor 

The image sensor below the screen print (black area at upper edge of the windscreen) 
points forward through the windscreen. The sensor field is 15° to the left and right (see 
graphic) as well as 5° to the top and bottom. 

The center axis of the image sensor must be aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the 
vehicle to ensure the same degree of functional accuracy for each type of vehicle. 

Otherwise, restrictions in the sensor field may result in impaired detection of vehicles in 
bends and less effective differentiation between vehicles and reflections from road signs. 

The high beam assistant adapts itself within a tolerance of 3°, thus automatically com-

Mounting and Connection 

Connection to the system network is provided by the existing 10-pin connector and an 
additional 3-pin connector. Both connectors are located in the base of the interior rear¬ 
view mirror and are secured with a connector holder. The pin assignments of the two 
connectors are listed in the section "Service information". 

The FLA is firmly connected to the vehicle windscreen by means of the mirror base. 

Without corresponding adaptation in vertical direction, the field of vision of the high beam 
assistant would vary upward or downward depending on the angle of inclination of the 
windscreen. 

To compensate for this deviation, different mounting brackets are used corresponding to 
the type of vehicle. 

The 3-pin connector features a mechanical coding facility which ensures the matching 
bracket is always used corresponding to the type of vehicle.

Principles of Operation 


The functions of the high beam assistant (FLA) relevant to the driver are automatic acti¬ 
vation of the high beam and low beam settings. For this purpose, the high beam assis¬ 
tant sends a recommendation to switch on or switch off high beam via the K-CAN bus 
to the lights module. 

This recommendation is always sent (also during daytime driving) at terminal 15 ON. 

The lights module evaluates the switch-on or switch-off recommendation only if the sys¬ 
tem has been activated by the driver. 

The high beam assistant always switches off high beam before another road user is daz¬ 
zled. High beam must therefore be switched off at the latest when another road user 
comes into the range of the light beam of the high beam headlights. 

Operation of the high beam assistant is based on an image sensor with image-process¬ 
ing software algorithms. 

Light components are registered by a red/white-sensitive image sensor and transferred 
to the FLA control unit. 


The image sensor is located at the base of the interior rear-view mirror with the FLA 
control unit housed in the mirror.

Electronic Evaluator 


The image sensor transmits the image via a LVDS data link to the microcontroller of the 
FLA control unit where it is stored in a buffer ready for evaluation. 

In addition to the light signals of the image sensor, the electronic evaluator also evaluates 
the vehicle speed. 

When the speed drops below 38 km/h, the high beam assistant sends a switch-off rec¬ 
ommendation to the lights module and dips the high beam headlights. The switch-off 
recommendation is sent irrespective of other conditions. 

As from a speed of more than 50 km/h, high beam is switched on again as soon as the 
situation so permits. 

Detection of Oncoming and Preceding Traffic 

The high beam assistant must detect oncoming traffic as soon as possible and dip the 
high beam headlights. The high beam must be dipped at the latest when the oncoming 
traffic enters the range of the high beam light beam (see graphic). This corresponds to a 
distance of approximately 400 m. 

The detection range of the image sensor is approximately 1000 m.

Detection of Street Lamps and Adequate General Light Levels 

According to European legislation, high beam is to be switched off in urban and non- 
urban areas that are sufficiently illuminated. There is therefore no regulation reguiring high 
beam to be switched off in unlit localities. Two methods are necessary to detect suffi¬ 
ciently lit areas (urban areas are normally lit). 

• Recognition of street lamps 

• Recognition of adeguate general light levels 

Recognition of Street Lamps 

The detection of street lamps is necessary to ensure rapid reaction of the system. Many 
street lamps indicate a built-up area or a sufficiently lit road. A deactivation recommenda¬ 
tion is sent when the high beam assistant detects several street lamps in short succes¬ 
sion. 

Recognition of Adequate General Light Levels 

At night, street lamps, billboards, housing lighting etc. generate relatively high general 
light levels within built up areas. The driver will normally not reguire high beam to be 
switched on in such areas. 

These different general light levels between urban and non-urban areas are registered by 
the image sensor and included in the evaluation process. High beam is switched off as 
from a certain general light level. The high beam deactivation recommendation is there¬ 
fore always sent during daytime driving. 


15 

High Beam Assistant 



Covered Sensor Field 

The image sensor is mounted on the mirror 
retaining fixture such that it covers a range of 5° .,5° 

up and down. The housing of the image sensor 
is designed such that it adapts to the corre- u o 
sponding windscreen of the vehicle. 

The high beam assistant recognizes when the sensor field is covered, e.g. by a sticker on 
the windscreen, soiled lens, snow on windscreen etc. due to the absence of light from 
the headlight in the lower area of the image. 

The check control message "Sensor field covered" warns the driver when the sensor field 
is covered. 

The sensor field of the image sensor must be covered for at least 16 seconds at a mini¬ 
mum speed of 5 km/h in order for a check control message to be sent. 

The high beam assistant cannot detect when 
only the upper area of the image is covered. A 
partially covered image sensor, however, can 
effect operation of the high beam assistant: the 
high beam assistant no longer detects light 
sources to their full extent. 

Misinterpretation of the surroundings can result in incorrect switch-on or switch-off rec¬ 
ommendations.

Indications and Operation 

An additional symbol in the instrument cluster signals the active status 

• Symbol ON = FLA active 

• Symbol OFF = FLA inactive 

Operation of the blue high beam indicator lamp remains unaffected. 
This lamp operates as normal in the instrument cluster. 






Operating Concept 

The high beam assistant (FLA) is active only under following preconditions: 

• Light switch set to automatic 

• Driving light activated by rain/driving lights sensor 

• Direction indicator/high beam switch flicked once in high beam direction 

The rules for automatically switching the high beam headlights on and off are stored in 
the light module. The high beam assistant is designed as an "assistance function" so that 
the driver always has the option and duty to override the system when the road situation 
so requires. 

The graphic on the following page shows the operation and function of the high beam 
assistant based on three scenarios. 

Scenario 1: 

The driver has activated the high beam assistant. Low beam is active because the traffic 
situation does not permit high beam. 

The headlight flasher is operated when the direction indicator/high beam switch is pulled 
in low beam direction (halogen headlights). 

Scenario 2: 

Irrespective of whether low beam or high beam is activated by the light module, the high 
beam assistant is deactivated when the direction indicator/high beam switch is pressed in 
high beam direction. 

Scenario 3: 

The automatic high beam is deactivated when the driver flicks the direction indicator/high 
beam switch in low beam direction while high beam is switched on. 

Reactivating: 

The high beam assistant is active again as soon as high beam is switched on after these 
situations.

Service Information 


Check Control Indicator 

The check control indicator can show three different statuses. 

Image Sensor Range 

The range of the image sensor and the incline of the windscreen result in a field of vision 
on the windscreen (light area) that must always remain clear. 

The high beam assistant may be adversely affected if this area is covered by, for exam¬ 
ple, stickers, snow and damage (cracks or large-scale stone impact). 

Encoding/programming 

The FLA can be adapted to various types of vehicle and national requirements by means 
of the coding data in the EEPROM. 

The high beam and low beam characteristics of the automatic function can also be influ¬ 
enced byway of encoding. The system is encoded and programmed via the OBD inter¬ 
face in the vehicle and this procedure must be performed after a replacement.

Possible Customer Perceptions 

If customer complaints are received, corresponding inquiries should be made with the 
customer before performing any repairs or diagnosis. 

The following customer statements are possible: 

"High beam is not deactivated when... " 

Customer statement: 

"The high beam assistant does not switch off high beam in built-up areas." 
Possible cause: 

The light levels in the area are too low. High beam remains switched on. 


Customer statement: 

"The high beam is not dipped in good time when driving over mountain passes." 
Possible cause: 

The high beam assistant detects other road users too late or not at all in sharp 
bends. 


Customer statement: 

"High beam is not dipped in response to an oncoming motor scooter." 

Possible cause: 

The high beam assistant does not detect poorly lit vehicles. The high beam assistant 
also does not detect pedestrians or animals on the road. 


Customer statement: 

"High beam is not dipped in time when oncoming traffic approaches over the brow 
of a hill." 

Possible cause: 

The high beam assistant does not detect higher light levels at the horizon. The high 
beam assistant does not respond with a switch-off recommendation before the 
actual headlights of the oncoming traffic are visible. 


Customer statement: 

"High beam is not dipped when a vehicle comes out of a side street." 

Possible cause: 

The high beam assistant does not detect vehicles at right angles to the own vehicle. 


21 

High Beam Assistant 



"High beam is not activated when... " 


Customer statement: 

"High beam is not switched on while driving slowly." 

Possible cause: 

The high beam assistant sends a switch-on recommendation to the lights module 
as from a driving speed of approximately 50 km/h. 


Customer statement: 

"High beam is switched off in bends." 

Possible cause: 

In tight bends it is possible that the vehicle speed drops below the speed threshold 
or there are considerable reflections from traffic signs, causing high beam to switch 
off. 


Customer statement: 

"High beam is switched off for no apparent reason." 

Possible cause: 

Highly reflective traffic signs or reflectors of other road users (e.g. trailer parked on 
side of road). 


Other Customer Statements: 

Customer statement: 

"The halogen bulbs for high beam are no longer operable." 

Possible cause: 

The auxiliary headlights with the halogen bulbs are switched on only as headlight 
flashers in connection with the high beam assistant. On vehicles equipped with the 
high beam assistant, the high beam is switched on only with the bi-xenon head¬ 
lights.
