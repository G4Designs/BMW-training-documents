Voltage Supply and Bus System 

The vehicle electrical system of the E63/64 is essentially based on the electrical system 
of the E60. This documentation describes the differences in the power supply, bus sys¬ 
tems and in the general vehicle electrical system compared to the E60. 

In the E60/E63, an energy management function is responsible for the power require¬ 
ments of the vehicle both while driving as well as when stationary. 

The most important integral parts of the energy management system are: 

• Intelligent battery sensor IBS 

• Power management software in the digital motor electronics DME or digital diesel 
electronics DDE and in the IBS. 

The power management controls the electric currents in the vehicle 

• Terminal 30g relay actuated by the car access system 

Power Supply 

Changes Compared to the E60 

The battery is installed in the luggage compartment recess. The power distribution box in 
the luggage compartment was repositioned from the side panel to the recess in the lug¬ 
gage compartment. The vehicle electrical system is extended with the integrated power 
supply module IVM if an 8-cylinder engine is installed.

Sunroof Visor 

The functions of the sunroof visor are based on the functions of the sunroof visor for the 
panoramic glass sunroof. 

Service Information 
Initialization 

Initialization of the glass tilt sunroof is based on that of the E60. The glass tilt sunroof can 
be initialized either via the control button or the tester. 

Only full initialization will ensure complete operability of the glass roof. 

Manual Initialization with Control Button 

The characteristic curve is relearned during every new or reinitialization of the glass tilt 
sunroof. 

Preconditions 

The glass sunroof must be clean and be at room temperature. Terminal 15 ON must be 
applied. When the glass tilt sunroof is subsequently initialized using the control button, 
this button must remain pressed until the initialization procedure is concluded. 

The control button is pressed and held in the lift sunroof direction. The initialization run 
starts up approx. 15 seconds after pressing the control button. 

Glass Tilt Sunroof 

The glass tilt sunroof can be replaced only together with the sunroof visor. 

The motors and the control unit can be replaced individually. The glass tilt sunroof must 
be encoded and initialized after replacing the control unit. 

Alarm System 

The alarm system detects and warns of any attempts to break in or tamper with the vehi¬ 
cle. The system is installed in various types of vehicles in different country-specific ver¬ 
sions. 

The anti-theft alarm system, integrated in the CAN-Sine, communicates with the compo¬ 
nents via the K-CAN or via the DWA bus. The DWA of the E63 is equipped with multiplex 
microwave sensors, the CAN-Sine and the DWA LED. 

For the first time at BMW, MuW (multiplex microwave sensors) sensors are fitted in 
the E63. 


8 

E63/64 Body Electrical 



The advantages of these MuW sensors are: 

• Interior protection 

• Effective MuW sensor detection during interior monitoring 

• No false alarms triggered by MuW sensors during interior monitoring 

The processor in the CAN-Sine features diagnostic capabilities and can be encoded. 

The MuW sensors assume the secondary functions and the CAN-Sine the main control 
unit function. 

The E63 is not equipped with the Ultrasonic interior movement detector USIS. The DWA 
logic and the emergency current siren with integrated tilt alarm sensor have been com¬ 
bined to form one unit, i.e. the CAN-Sine.

Exterior Lights 
Changes Compared to the E60 

The E63/64 features 2 lamp bulbs in each directional indicator for the front direction 
indicator function. 

The marker light of the E63 is fed from below into the light guide. The hotspot is located 
at the feed point of the light guide. 

The front side markers are equipped with lamp bulbs. LEDs are used for the tail 
lights/brake lights.

Brake Force Display 

The BFD can currently be used only in the US country-specific version. The upper LEDs 
of the rail light are used as the BFD as of a deceleration of 6 m/s2. 


10 

E63/64 Body Electrical 








The seats in the E63 have been adapted from the E46/2. 

All seats feature a manual head restraint adjustment facility in up and down direction. 

The sports seat additionally features a seat depth adjustment. 

The seat functions have been adopted from the E46/2. 

Steering Column Memory 

The memory positions for the steering column are stored and managed in the center 
console switch center. 

Seat Heating 

The seat heating is activated and controlled from the SZM. The seat heating is supplied 
with a clocked voltage. The heating output control that is required in order to regulate the 
temperature is achieved by pulse width modulation of the heating current. The clocking 
frequency is 25 Hz.

E63 Advanced Safety Electronics 

The advanced safety electronics ASE is the electronic safety system for the 6 Series 
Coupe. In principle the ASE is the same as the system in the E60. The ASE has been 
correspondingly adapted for the E63 

The changes to the ASE system on the E63 have been made in the following areas: 

• B-pillar satellites 

• AITS I (head airbag) 

• Active knee protector (US) 

Note: 

This Workshop Manual is only a supplement to the E60 Training Reference 
manual. Only the changes compared to the E60 are described. 

B-Pillar Satellites 

The following changes have been made on the E63 to the B-pillar satellites: 

• No ignition circuits for the active head restraints 

• No ignition circuits for the rear side airbags 

• No ignition circuits for the rear seat belt tensioners 

The SBSL still controls and monitors the following trigger circuits: 

• Head airbag (AITS I) left 

• Seat belt tensioner, left 

The SBSR still controls and monitors the following trigger circuits: 

• Front airbag, passenger 

• Head airbag (AITS I) right 

• Seat belt tensioner, right 

AITS I (Head Airbag) 

The advanced inflatable tubular structure (AITS I) is used on the E63. The difference 
compared to the AITS II of the E60 is the length adaptation to the body of the 6 Series 
Coupe. The AITS I is the head airbag for the driver and passenger side. The AITS I 
extends from the A-pillar back to the B-pillar and covers the entire side area of the 
driver/passenger. 


12 

E63/64 Body Electrical 



Active Knee Protection 

The E63 US features knee airbags on the driver's side and passenger's side. 

In the event of a crash, the knee airbag adds additional support for the knees. This initi¬ 
ates a controlled forward shift of the upper body, which is cushioned by the relevant 
airbag. 

The knee airbag on the driver's side is located behind a cover under the steering column. 

The knee airbag on the passenger's side is located behind a cover in the flap of the glove 
compartment.

E64 Advance Safety Electronics 

E64 Advance Safety Electronics are based on the systems of the E60/E63. 

Changes to E64 ASE 

The following charges have been made to the E64 ASE compared to the E60/E63: 

• AITS head protection is eliminated 

• New rollover protection system URSS added 

• Seat-integrated belt system SGS 

• New vehicle center satellite, SFZ-R, with Rollover and acceleration sensors 

• Updated SGM to include actuators for Rollover protection system 

Rollover Protection System 

The Rollover protection system for the E64 consists of the following: 

• byteflight, the optical bus system 

• SGM 

• SBSL with acceleration sensors 

• SBSR with acceleration sensors 

• TMFA with door pressure sensor 

• TMBF with door pressure sensor 

• SFZ-R with Rollover sensor and Acceleration Sensors 

• satellite switching center steering column SZL 

• URSS unit 

SFZ-R 

The SFZ-R of the E64 includes the additional sensors for rollover protection system acti¬ 
vation. Sensor data is sent via byteflightto the SGM. The SFZ-R is mounted on the 
transmission tunnel. 

SFZ-R Sensors 

Included in SFZ-R are the following sensors: 

• Longitudinal acceleration sensor (x axis) 

• Transverse acceleration sensor (y axis) 

• Low g sensor (Rollover sensor) (Z-axis) 

• Turning rate sensor (turn in the x axis) 

15 

E63/64 Body Electrical 





Function Mode 

The SFZ-R contains two processors, the main processor and the auxiliary processor. The 
main processor computes an estimated angle of the vehicle based on data received from 
the ASE system sensors and information from the Rollover sensor and the turning rate 
sensor. The auxiliary processor computes estimated vehicle angle based on data 
received for the transverse acceleration sensors, the Rollover sensor and the turning rate 
sensor. 

Information from both the main and auxiliary processors is constantly compared. If the 
processors determine the angle of the vehicle exceeds a fixed threshold the following 
sequence is initiated: 

• The main processor advises the SGM the vehicle has exceeded threshold limits vi 

the byteflight 

• The auxiliary processor activates the arming line (New to the E64) to the SGM 

• The SGM evaluated information received from both processors 

• The SGM activates both Rollover protection devices and they are driven up by 
spring pressure

Since there are no Head Airbag AITS devices in the E64, the SBSL is only responsible 
for the activation of the driver side knee airbag and seat belt tensioner. 


The SBSR is responsible for the activation of the passenger front airbag, knee airbag and 
seat belt tensioner.
