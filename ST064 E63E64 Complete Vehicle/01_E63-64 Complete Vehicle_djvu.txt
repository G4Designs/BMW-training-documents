History of BMW Coupes 

The Coupe bodystyle has always been associated with words such as style, elegance, 
sportiness and exclusivity. This was the case when in 1909 Henry Ford introduced his 
celebrated "Tin Lizzy," the Coupe version of the Model T. And this was also the case 
when in 1931 BMW launched its first - small - white/blue Coupe called the DA4. 

Ever since then, the Coupe has played a vital role in BMW's success and image. Even in 
difficult times for BMW, this "beautiful sister of the Saloon" has heightened the profile of 
the BMW marque amidst the mass of car manufacturers. Today as ever the combination 
of sportiness and elegance arouses the passions of the public. 

This is especially true of high-performance luxury-class Coupes. It is these models in par¬ 
ticular which are the focus of the general public's interest, attracting huge crowds around 
them at motor shows and thereby highlighting the marque image. BMW has always taken 
the bull by the horns and thus the new BMW Coupe is continuing a proud tradition. 

501 502 and 503 

1951 saw the launch of the BMW 
501, known in popular parlance as 
the "baroque angel." The 502 with 
V8 engine arrived in 1954. In the 
same year, the 501 and 502 
Coupes were fashioned from 
these Saloons. The intention was 
to offer particularly discerning customers something quite unique for a price of 20,000 
deutschmarks - at the time, however, you could buy your own house for that amount of 
money. Barely 50 of these Coupes were sold in the first year. 

In 1955 BMW made its debut on the international stage in Frankfurt with the 503 Coupe. 
A V8 engine and every conceivable luxury available at the time such as leather upholstery 
and power windows established it as a luxury toy for the super-rich. 276 of these 503 
Coupes costing roughly 30,000 marks each had been built by 1959. 


In 1961 the famous Italian body stylist Nuccio Bertone was 
commissioned to design a new BMW V8 Coupe. Clear, 
smooth lines exuded elegant dynamics. By 1965 Bertone 
had delivered 603 bodies to BMW, where they were com¬ 
pleted - in accordance with individual customer requirements 
- to create the 3200 CS. 


3200 CS

2000 CS to 3.0 CSi 

In mid-1965 BMW presented a new, not quite so selectively 
targeted Coupe based on the successful new 4-cylinder 
Saloons. The BMW designers had discovered a new BMW 
line: compact, sportily elegant and above all distinctive. 


Three years later this 2000 CS 
Coupe was completely 
redesigned and equipped with a 
6-cylinder engine. The range now 
stretched from the 2800 CS 
through to the 3.0 CSi Coupe. 
The E9 Coupe utilized the technology and engineering of the new top-class 2500 and 
2800 Saloons but was closely allied to the 2000 CS in terms of form and shape. 

This Coupe with a 2.5 to 3-liter engine created a stir not only on the boulevards but also 
on the racetrack. In the guise of the 3.0 CSL lightweight Coupe, these racers with up to 
900 bhp under the bonnet and Hans-Joachim Stuck, Brian Redman or Ronnie Petersson 
behind the wheel ran the competition of Porsche and Ford into the ground. 

A total of 44,237 of the 2000 CS and E9 were built in a period of 11 years. 




E24 

The first BMW Coupe to be called 
a 6 Series came onto the market 
in 1976. The oil crisis and bur¬ 
geoning environmental aware¬ 
ness brought a halt to the rushed 
explosion of power. But even with 
an engine developing from 185 to 
286 bhp (M version), this Coupe 
was in no way underpowered. 

Comfort and engine and chassis 
electronics made the 6 Series a huge international success. By the time production was 
terminated in 1989, a total of 86,199 had been sold in a period of 14 years: Never before 
had a BMW Coupe been so successful. 

E31 

BMW ensured its place in automobile history with the introduction in 1989 of the 8 
Series Coupe. Two years after the market launch of the first German 12-cylinder engine 
since the 1930s in the 750i, this power plant was transplanted into an absolute luxury- 
class Coupe. The latest in engineering, technology and design which BMW was able to 
offer was just what was needed.

With an 8-cylinder version also intro¬ 
duced later, it was always possible to 
reach 250 km/h effortlessly (cut-off) 
whenever one wanted. But what this 
car also uniquely offered was the 
sheer pleasure of smooth driving with 
the reassurance of optimum safety. 
A total of 31,283 E31 models were 
built over a period of 10 years. 



E63 Introduction 

All the significant innovations of the E65 or E60 are also offered in the 6 Series Coupe. 

However the E63 also offers new features of its own. The most important of these new 

features are: 

• Body of composite construction. Doors made of aluminum, hood made of bonded 
aluminum, side panels made of thermoplastic and trunk lid made of SMC plastic 
extend far beyond the GRAV (reduced weight aluminum front end) of steel and alu¬ 
minum already established in the E60. 

• "Panorama" glass sunroof with a comparatively huge surface, whose floating 
roofliner comes in two parts so that when opened it can be accommodated under 
the remaining area of the steel roof in front of the rear window. 

Additional new features introduced on the E63 will migrate to other models. 

• “CCC” Car Communication Computer is the central control unit for all 
Information/communication systems in the E63 

• “HUD” Head up Display 

• New DWA with improved sensor capability 

• Knee air bags

Body 


Aluminum Doors 

The E63 has aluminum doors. This feature reduces the weight of the car by 10 kg. 

The E63's aluminum doors exceed all internal BMW rigidity and safety requirements. 
Each door has two reinforcement members with door hooks arranged in a V-shape. 



Hood 

As in the E60, the E63's hood is made of aluminum. 

However, a new manufacturing process is used. For the first time in a BMW vehicle, the 
inner and outer skin panels of the bonnet are joined with a 2-component adhesive as an 
underlining. This turns the two skin panels into a single structural unit. 

This manufacturing procedure helps to keep both aluminum skin panels thin, a factor 
which reduces the bonnet weight by 12 kg. Even the acoustic behavior is improved. The 
increased rigidity prevents the bonnet from vibrating almost completely at high speeds. 
This vibration is normally absorbed without being noticed and can disturb the driver's 
concentration while driving. 

The hood of the E63 can be moved into a service position. A special tool is needed for 
this purpose. 

The gap dimensions to the side panel and to the bumper are adjusted via elongated 
holes. These elongated holes are situated on the hinges and on the bonnet lock. 

Front Fenders 

For the first time in a vehicle built by the BMW Group, a thermoplastic (in this instance 
"Noryl GTX" from GE Plastics) has been used for the large-scale manufacture of a side 
panel. 


8 

E63/E64 Complete Vehicle 













The decision to use a thermoplastic was made for 3 primary reasons: 

• The E63 as a luxury-class car should be distinct in terms of design from the E60 
mass-produced model. However, the level of remodeling required for this purpose 
cannot be accomplished in steel or aluminum and the same argument applies to 
integrating the direction indicator and the chrome trim bar in the side panel. 


c ? ° ° 


< 5 » 





• The weight-reducing potential of thermoplastic is 50% compared with a side panel 
made of sheet steel; in this particular case 2 kg per side panel of thermoplastic as 
against 4 kg per side panel of sheet steel. 

• Increased buckling resistance as the primary customer benefit for reducing minor 
damage and the corrosion-resistant properties of the material. 

Because plastic expands or contracts in direct response to the outside temperature, the 
side panel is mounted in a "floating" manner. This means that the the front side panels 
are attached in such a way as to allow the material to expand or contract without incurring 
damage. 

The connection to the body is established by means of 3 screw connections on the A- 
pillar, 2 screwing points in the sill area and 8 screwing points on the reduced-weight alu¬ 
minum front end (GRAV). 

To allow linear expansion as a function of the climatic conditions, the screwing points on 
the GRAV are designed to be "floating." A maximum linear expansion of 2.5 mm is possi¬ 
ble in the vehicle longitudinal direction; in the event of further expansion, the side panel 
assumes a block setting.

Workshop Exercise (optional) - Front Fender Removal/lnstall 


1. Before removing front fender, you must first remove the rocker panel cover. 

2. Remove the 2 screws from the front of the inner fender liner and fold in 
(where it joins the front bumper cover). 

3. The upper light housing (above headlamps) will be removed with the fender. 

4. Remove the bolts (Torx T30) and 2 nuts at the rear fender base as shown below: 

© ? T 9 9 <» 



5. Note which bolts are different _ 

6. Consult Repair Instructions, are there any special tools required for adjusting/ 
installing the fender assembly? (if so, what is the tool number and what is it for) 


7. Before installing a fender, allow time for it to “climatize” in the same area as the 
vehicle (temperature, humidity, moisture, etc) for expansion/contraction. 

Notes:

Trunk Lid 


This trunk lid made of SMC (Sheet Moulding Compound) saves approx. 25% weight 
compared with a corresponding component made of steel. 

The trunk lid of the E63 incorporates the aerials for the telephone and the navigation sys¬ 
tem. This is also an E63 innovation. 

Like the thermoplastic front side panels, the SMC trunk lid can also expand slightly under 
the effects of heat. It is therefore extremely important for the lid to be correctly adjusted. 

Surface damage in the form of scratches can be repaired with the BMW repair spatula kit. 
In the event of fractures or cracks, the complete component must be replaced.

Panorama Sunroof 

The panorama glass sunroof comprises a glass roof, a two-part floating roofliner, two 
electric motors and the casing housing the mechanism. 

The system is controlled by means of a switch and a control unit which is mounted 
behind the glovebox. The front electric motor moves the glass roof. The glass roof can 
only be tilted and cannot be opened fully. The rear electric motor moves the two-part 
floating roofliner. The roofliner in the E63 is in two parts as there would not be enough 
space between the rear edge of the sunroof and the front edge of the rear window for 
a single undivided component. 

Both the glass roof and the roofliner have anti-trapping protection.

E64 Complete Vehicle 



The 6 Series E64 Convertible is based on the E63 Coupe. External dimensions for the 
Convertible are the same as the Coupe. Trunk volume is reduced from 450 L to 350 L 
(with the top up) and 300 L (with the top down). 

Empty weight is increased by 2 00kg, to 1815kg.
