Introduction 


One of the most overlooked features on a vehicle is the chassis and suspension sys¬ 
tem. Most of the time, people who buy new vehicles are initially attracted to the style 
of the body. Some buyers are interested in the performance of the engine or the 
convenience features such as the audio system etc. 

BMW vehicles are well known for having “cutting edge” engine technology. However, in 
order to be known as the “Ultimate Driving Machine”, it is the chassis that must provide 
the driver with comfort, safety and superior “road-holding” performance. 

Since the most early development period of the automobile, chassis designs have had 
to keep up with the demands of the engine. The chassis and suspension system 
designs have also evolved with increasing demands of the driver and the road 
conditions.

BMW Suspension Systems 

















As vehicles get more powerful and demands for ride comfort and driving safety rise, 
so do the demands placed on the modern chassis. 

Requirements of a modern steering system: 

• Ensure steerability in accordance with the driving conditions. 

• Provide function, comfort and safety. 

• Dampen vibration. 

• Convey a confident “road feel” by transferring road surface 
information to the driver. 

• Allow sufficient steering wheel return after cornering. 

The focus of this training module will be on BMW steering and suspension systems. 
This will include all front and rear axle designs as well as adjustments where applicable.

BMW Front Suspension History 


here are three basic front axle designs used on BMW vehicles: 

• Single-Joint Spring Strut Front Axle 

• Double-Pivot Spring Strut Front Axle 

• Double Wishbone Front Axle 

Single-joint Spring Strut Front Axle 

The “Single-Joint” design has been in use since the introduction of the E30. It was 
used on the E30, E36, E46, E85 and the E86 vehicles. The design includes a steel 
axle carrier which allows the mounting of the engine mounts, steering rack, sway bar 
and lower control arm mount. 

The axle carrier is bolted to the body structure via 4 bolts. There are two locating dow¬ 
els which provide proper axle location as well as added strength. The “sickle-shaped” 
lower control arm is attached to the axle carrier via a ball joint, there is also an additional 
rubber mount which is attached to the body. The lower control arm also provides the 
“single-pivot” point for the steering knuckle. 

The single-joint design has advantages due to it’s low weight and compact design. 

The geometry of the single pivot allows for a small positive steering offset, but the 
size of the brake rotor is ultimately limited. Flowever, it is ideally suited for smaller 
cars (such as the early 3-series).

E46 / E85 Front Suspension 

The front suspension on the E46 and E85 is based on the single-joint front suspension 
used on the previous 3-series models (E30/E36). This suspension includes some design 
changes to enhance ride guality and handling characteristics. 

The changes to the front suspension are as follows: 

• A new forged aluminum lower control arm (except Xi models). The lighter arm 
offers a lower unsprung mass. 

• The rear lower control arm bushing is hydraulic. 

• Hollow strut piston rods for reduced weight. 

• The steering knuckles are “press-fit” to the strut tubes. 

• The overall caster angle has been increased to improve “straight-line” stability. 

• The track has been widened for improved cornering ability. 

• The brake dust shields are made from aluminum. 

Altogether there is a weight reduction of 5.72 pounds of “un-sprung” weight which 
enhances ride comfort and handling.

Adjustments 

There are some limited adjustments on the “Single-Joint” front suspension. Front toe 
is adjustable on all models via the threaded outer tie rod. This can be achieved using 
standard hand tools. 

There are no provisions for caster adjustment. However, Caster should always be 
checked during the wheel alignment to ensure that there is no damaged components. 

Camber is only adjustable on the E46 and E85. There is a slot in the upper strut 
tower which will allow small camber changes of up to 0.5 degrees. If the camber 
adjustment cannot be achieved, check for proper ride height and inspect for any 
suspension damage. 



The illustrations above show the camber adjustment slots and special tool. The proper 
instructions for the camber adjustment can be found in ISTA and WebTIS Repair 
Instructions under Group 32. 

To adjust the camber, loosen 2 of the nuts on the upper strut mount and remove the 
remaining nut. Drive out the pin in the strut plate. Install special tool # 323 140. Turn the 
adjusting nut as needed on the special tool to make camber the adjustment. 



It may be necessary to unload the suspension to make the needed 
camber adjustment. The weight of the vehicle on the strut plate may 
prevent movement while making the adjustment. Damage to special 
tool can result.

Double Pivot Spring Strut Front Axle 

The double-pivot front axle configuration has been in use since the earliest 6 and 7 
series vehicles were in production (E23/E24). This design is ideally suited for larger 
cars due to its rugged construction. 

The double-pivot front axle is used on the following vehicles: 

• 1 Series - Both the E82 and E88 currently use this type of front axle. 

• 3 Series - From E90 through the E93 and most recently the F30. 

• 5 Series - From the E28 through the current E60/E61. 

• 6 Series - Both the E24 and the new E63/E64. 

• 7 Series - All models from the E23 to the current E65/E66. 

• 8 Series - E31 

• Z Series - The E89 Z4 uses it since start of production. 

• X Series - The E83, E53, E84 and F25 use this axle with slight modifications for 

xDrive and EPS (E84 sDrive Trailing links and xDrive Leading links). 

One of the primary features that separates this design from the single-joint front axle is 
the lower pivot point. This suspension design consists of one upper pivot (strut bearing) 
and two lower pivot points. The lower pivot is actually two separate points. These two 
points together create an imaginary (virtual) pivot point or “axis”. 

The design eliminates a single pivot (ball joint), which limits the size of the brake rotor 
and the amount of steering offset (scrub radius). The steering offset still remains positive, 
but less than that of the single pivot design.

Additional advantages of the double pivot system are: 

• Ability to reduce body roll while cornering. 

• Reduces front end dive tendencies during severe braking situations. 

• Utilization of a small positive steering offset, which offers improved handling. 
This is more evident when the friction levels differ while braking. 

• Improved caster position, improving straight line stability at higher speeds, 
plus better steering return after small steering inputs.

Double Pivot Operation 

The true benefits of the double-pivot suspension become more evident during turns. 

On a traditional single-pivot design, the camber and caster remain static during steering 
maneuvers. On a vehicle with positive caster, the wheels tend to “flop over” during turns. 
This situation reduces the tire contact area with the road and increases the effort 
reguired for steering wheel return. The steering offset (scrub) also remains fixed which 
has a negative impact on steering wheel return as well. 

The double-pivot design allows the “imaginary” lower pivot point to change relative loca¬ 
tion during turns. The tire which is on the outside of the turn is carrying the majority of 
the load. Therefore it is the outside tire which must have the most contact area with the 
road surface. 

On a turn, the double-pivot design causes the caster and camber on the outside wheel 
to become closer to zero. This optimizes the “contact patch” between the tire and the 
road greatly enhancing handling characteristics. 

The body roll is also reduced by the caster change towards zero. One of the other 
benefits of this arrangement is the variable steering offset. The variable steering 
offset during turns provides for better “returnability” of the steering wheel.

Double Pivot Front Axle Configurations 

The double pivot axle features an axle carrier, to which the suspension components are 
attached. The carrier also provides the mounting points for the steering rack, stabilizer 
bar and engine mounts. The carrier is either steel (on the earlier models), or aluminum. 

The aluminum carrier was first used on the E39 six-cylinder (528i) from 1997. The E39 
was the first and only models to have both steel and aluminum carriers. The E39 540i 
featured a steel carrier with a steering box (instead of a rack and pinion). Aluminum 
components were used wherever possible on the 540i, except on the suspension carrier. 
On the other hand, the E39 528i was equipped with an aluminum carrier and a steering 
rack. 

Since then, all vehicles equipped with the double-pivot suspension utilized the aluminum 
carrier and steering rack configuration.

E38 Front Suspension 

The E38 uses an updated version of the double-pivot suspension as compared to the 
previous 7 series designs (E23/E32). The features of the E38 suspension are as follows: 

• Suspension carrier is made from tubular steel as opposed to stamped steel. 

• Suspension carrier is lighter and can be removed as a complete unit. 

• Design changes allow for larger front brake rotors. 

• Slight difference in the configuration of the lower control arms. 

• Lower forward control arms are made from forged aluminum. 

• Variable diameter coil springs provide lower profile.

E6x Front Suspension 

The double-pivot front suspension has been further enhanced since initially introduced. 
The materials used in the front axle carrier offer high tensile strength to support extreme 
loads. The front axle carrier is also manufactured entirely from aluminum. It consists of 
cast alloy preformed sections which are welded into the extruded sections. The front axle 
carrier accommodates the steering gear, control arms and tension struts, engine mounts, 
stabilizer bar, heat shield and the underbody panels. 

A “thrust zone” panel is bolted on to increase the transverse rigidity of the front of the 
vehicle. This reinforcement has a positive effect on the handling, sound level and crash 
performance. The benefits as a result of the improved front axle include increased agility, 
improved comfort by the reduction of unsprung weight, a reduction in fuel consumption 
by lowering the gross vehicle weight and better axle load distribution. 

The front double pivot suspension used since the introduction of the E65/66 
includes the following: 

• Aluminum front axle carrier 

• “Thrust zone” panel for increased rigidity 

• Aluminum suspension components 

• Aluminum strut tubes 

The front suspension on the E6x vehicles also includes accommodations 
for the Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) system.

E8x / E9x Front Suspension 

The E9x and E8x vehicles also use the double-pivot front suspension. Traditionally, 
the 3-series was equipped with the single pivot design. The E90 marked the first 
time that the double-pivot design was used in the 3-series platform. 

The E82 has many features in common with the E9x vehicles especially the chassis 
and dynamic driving systems. Therefore the double pivot spring strut front axle design 
was also installed on the E8x 1 Series vehicles. With the exception of the 135i sport 
tuned version the BMW 1 Series front and rear suspensions were all inspired by the 
E90 design.

The double-pivot system establishes a geometrical “axis” formed by the suspension 
links, creating one upper and two lower pivot points. Two lower pivot points (double 
pivot) formed by the control arm and tension strut create an “imaginary” pivot point, 
that is extended further out on the wheel carrier. This design allows pivot points on 
the wheel carrier to be selected in order to effectively accommodate larger brakes. 

Additional advantages of double pivot system are: 

• Ability to reduce body roll while cornering. 

• Reduces front nose dive tendencies during severe braking situations. 

• Utilization of a small positive steering offset which offers improved handling 
while braking in split “|j” conditions. 

• Enhanced caster position, improves straight line stability at higher speeds, 
plus better steering return after small steering inputs.

E89 Front Suspension 

The E85 was equipped with a single-joint spring strut front axle so to optimize the 
suspension properties, the E89 is equipped with a double-pivot (double joint spring 
strut) front axle. 

An even further modified version of the Double-pivot front axle known from the E8x and 
E9x series vehicles is used in the E89. Adaptations were necessary due to the available 
space and the modified suspension geometry. 

The well-proven principle of the central link rear axle from the E85 is retained 
for the rear axle.

Steering Offset on the E89 

The steering offset (scrub radius) of the E89 is greater compared to that of the E85. 
The reason for this is that the front axle has been adopted from production line 2 
(1 Series and 3 Series). 


On the single-joint spring strut front axle of the E85 the position of the wheel control 
joint largely determines the size of the steering offset. Since the steering offset should 
be as small as possible, the wheel control joint must be located as far towards the out- 
side as possible. This however results in problems Dctermining , he Lower Pivo , Point 
concerning the package space for the brake disc 
and brake calliper. On the double-pivot (double-joint 
spring strut) front axle the position of the control arm 
and tension strut with respect to each other deter¬ 
mines the size of the steering offset. 

The pivot points of the control arm or wishbone and 
tension strut at the swivel bearing can therefore be 
selected such that no space problems are encoun¬ 
tered for the brake system. 



While these aspects still retain their validity, a larger 

steering offset than on the single-joint spring strut front axle is now used. The reason for 
this is that common parts from production line 2 are used as far as possible but the track 
width has increased compared to the 1 Series and 3 Series. Among other measures, 
this was achieved by changing the rim offset, thus, of course, also increasing the 
steering offset. 


The effects of increased susceptibility to interference caused by a larger steering offset 
were eliminated by an optimized and modified elastokinematics system and tuned to 
such an extent that an improvement was achieved 
compared to the E85. As a result, the response of 
the E89 to steering movements is slightly more 
indirect at high speeds and very direct at speeds 
up to 100 km/h (62 mph). The vehicle handling is 
well balanced up to the limit range and therefore 
has outstanding control properties.

Both tension struts are mounted with hydraulic bushings on the front axle carrier. In addi¬ 
tion, the distance of the tension strut and control arm pivot points at the swivel bearing 
largely determines the vertical force lever arm. The further the joints of the tension strut 
and control arm are from each other at the swivel bearing, the greater the recovery force 
initiated by the vehicle weight. 

On the single-joint spring strut front axle, the distance is zero as the two joints of this 
axle have merged to form one. The resulting advantage of the double-joint spring strut 
front axle is improved directional stability in the high speed range and a lower tendency 
to steering instability in the lower speed range (less susceptible to torsional vibration in 
the steering wheel). 

Compared to that of the control arm, the ball joint (guide joint) of the tension strut is 
raised at the swivel bearing, thus providing effective anti-dive control. A further advan¬ 
tage of this arrangement is that this tension strut mount on the axle carrier can be 
arranged at approximately the same level with respect to the mounting at the swivel 
bearing and does not have to be lowered. This is of particular benefit to a large overhang 
angle. In addition, it is possible to lower the control arm mount on the axle carrier side, 
thus enabling a lower roll center. 

The single-joint axle features only one type of cross brace as the axle carrier. The dou¬ 
ble-pivot (double joint spring strut) front axle on the other hand features a frame which 
additionally provides significant stiffening of the front end.

F30 Front Suspension 

The double-pivot front axle with trailing links in the F30 represents the optimum combi¬ 
nation of driving dynamics and ride comfort. The load-bearing function of the steering 
box housing achieves an extremely high degree of rigidity with the lowest possible 
weight. 

Compared to its predecessor in the E90, the front axle support in the F30 must satisfy 
more stringent requirements. A second crash load path has now been integrated above 
the front axle support. In order to guarantee optimum crash behavior, a high-strength 
welded steel structure has been used instead of an aluminim front axle support. 

The Electronic Power Steering EPS (electromechanical power steering) featured in the 
F30 makes an important contribution to BMW EfficientDynamics. The F30 is available 
with 2 types of EPS (Basic and Variable sport option)

Improved acoustic properties and maximum rigidity and accompanying increase 
in ride comfort can be achieved within a small installation space. 

The ball joints of the front axle have a reduced friction design which results in improved 
response characteristics. Also the use of cast aluminim parts (wishbones, trailing links) 
and aluminim die-cast parts (swivel bearings) reduces the unsprung masses. 

For vehicles with an adaptive M sports suspension (optional equipment 2VF) 
the electronic damper control EDC is also integrated.

Sport Activity Vehicles (Except E70) Front Suspension 

The E53, E83, E84 and F25 vehicles use a modified version of the double-pivot 
(double joint spring strut) front suspension. There are modifications to accommodate 
the front drive axle components. Although most xDrive vehicles use hydraulic rack and 
pinion steering the E84 and F25 use EPS. There is an aluminum thrust panel which 
helps protect the oil pan and also provides additional stiffening properties for the front 
suspension carrier.

F25 Front Axle with EPS 

The Double-pivot front suspension with trailing links in the F25 offers the ideal combina¬ 
tion of driving dynamics and ride comfort. The supporting function of the rack and pinion 
steering housing achieves extremely high rigidity with minimum weight. Low-friction ball 
joints are used in the front axle. This has greatly improved the response characteristics 
over its predecessor. 

The standard Electronic Power Steering (EPS) is a distinctive feature of the F25 and 
makes a significant contribution to "EfficientDynamics". (2VL Variable sport steering 
is available as an option). 

The Electronic Damper Control (EDC) is also available as optional equipment 
(SA 223 Dynamic Damper Control).

Adjustments - Double-Pivot Front Axle 

As with all BMW front suspensions, Caster angle is not adjustable. However, during 
an alignment, Caster should always be checked to rule out any damage to the chassis 
or suspension components. 

As with other models, Toe is adjustable via the threaded tie rod assembly. 

Camber is adjustable by a slotted strut mounting holes. This adjustment is only 
available as from the E53. Vehicles which are capable of this adjustment include, 

E53, E6x, E9x, E8x. 

On the E84, F25 and F30 the camber can be corrected by using special offset 
swivel bearings which are available from the parts department. 



Two versions of the swivel bearings are available: 

• Version 1: camber correction -0° 30' 

• Version 2: camber correction 0° 30'.

The E83, E53, E84, F25 and F30 vehicles use a modified version of 
the Double-pivot front suspension which may also be referred to as 
Double-joint spring strut front axle.

Double Wishbone Front Axle 


E7x Front Suspension 

The first time a double wishbone front suspension was used on a BMW vehicle was on 
the E70. The outstanding driving dynamics, the excellent driving comfort as well as the 
stable straight-ahead running properties are factors of this design solution that contribute 
to a high degree of driving pleasure and safety while making the vehicle ideal for every 
day use.

The upper control arm (wishbone) positively influences front wheel travel by reducing 
Camber changes during jounce and rebound events. 

The arrangement of the suspension allows the strut assembly to be focused on 
dampening duties alone. The strut is no longer part of the steering, but fixed in place 
(no upper bearing). The steering axis now rotates by way of the swivel bearing (6). 

The arrangement of the front suspension includes bushings at various swivel points. 
This allows for reduced friction, which in turn allows the damper to respond to road 
surface irregularities in a more sensitive manner. 

This design works well in conjunction with the Vertical Dynamics Management 
(VDM) system. 

Components with special materials (see previous graphic): 

• The forged aluminum swivel bearing (6) with the 3rd generation wheel bearing (7) 
Semi-trailing arm connected via steel bushes/tapered screw connection to the 
swivel bearing. 

• The upper control arm (4) is made from forged aluminum and the cylindrical ball 
joint pin is clamped in the swivel bearing (6). 

• Tension strut with hydraulic mount (9) and lower control arm (10) are forged steel 
components while the bottom control arm bears the spring strut (3) by means of 
the cast steel spring strut fork (11). 

• The front axle subframe is a welded steel structure with an aluminum thrust panel 
for maximum lateral stiffness with service openings. 

The steering pivot axis of the wheel suspen¬ 
sion is now formed by a joint at the upper 
control arm and the virtual pivot point of the 
lower arm level as known from the spring 
strut axle.

In comparison with the double pivot spring strut front axle on the E65, the FOx/FIx front 
axle design offers the following advantages: 

• Higher transverse acceleration is reflected in greater vehicle agility. 

• Improved cornering/steering and transition characteristics which are particularly 
favorable in terms of rolling motion. 

• Reduced interference means greater comfort. 

• Shock absorbers that are subjected to virtually no transverse forces provide greater 
comfort. 

• The design layout of the double wishbone front axle facilitates vertical dynamics 
control (VDC) and xDrive (as on the E70/E71) without the need to adjust height 
and no spring travel loss. 

• Double wishbone front axles improve directional stability. 

The outstanding driving dynamics, the excellent driving comfort as well as the exception¬ 
al directional stability are factors of this double wishbone front axle design solution that 
contribute to a high degree of driving pleasure and safety while making the vehicle ideal 
for every day use and providing the most relaxing drive on long journeys. 

The introduction of a second control arm level for wheel control, which is arranged above 
the wheel, results in additional degrees of freedom for the kinematics of the front axle as 
well as for the suspension/damping compared to other designs such as a spring strut 
front axle.

SAI - Virtual Pivot Point on Double Wishbone Front Axle 

As is the case with the E70 the steering axis inclination (1) of the wheel suspension 
is formed by a joint at the top A-arm and the virtual pivot point of the lower arm. 
This allows the steering pivot axis to be positioned in such a way as to produce 
a small steering offset at hub (3) with sufficient weight recoil.

This steering offset at hub is a direct influence on the scrub radius which is decisive 
for transmitting the irregularities on the road surface to the steering wheel. 

The lower and upper arm levels now move simultaneously in response to wheel deflec¬ 
tion. As a result, as the spring compresses, the wheel pivots in such a way that the 
camber does not decrease as much as is the case with a spring strut front axle. 

Since the two control arm levels undertake the wheel control, the damper is virtually 
no longer subjected to transverse forces and rotational motion. 

This makes it possible to do without a roller bearing assembly on the spring strut sup¬ 
port. Instead of this conventional roller bearing, a damping and support unit is installed 
that takes up all three load paths. The load paths are the damper piston rod, the inner 
auxiliary spring and the bearing spring. This damping and support unit is still referred 
to as the "strut mount". 

Due to the lack of transverse forces, the piston rod can be made thinner, resulting in a 
similar displacement volume in the push and pull direction of the damper. This serves 
to improve the design layout of the damper and is the prerequisite for the innovative 
damper control system - vertical dynamics control (VDC). 

Due to the substantially lower friction at the circumference of the piston rod, the damper 
can respond more sensitively. 

By connecting the stabilizer bar via the stabilizer link to the spring strut, the torsion in 
response to body roll motion is equivalent to the total wheel lift from the inside to the 
outside of the curve (in other suspension setups, the stabilizer bars are connected to 
a transverse control arm and therefore achieve only a fraction of the torsion angle). 

Despite being highly effective, this high degree of torsion allows the stabilizer bar to 
be made relatively thin which has a favorable effect on driving comfort and dynamics 
as well as saving weight.

Adjustments - Double Wishbone Front Axle 

The Toe adjustment on the double wishbone front axle is carried out by means 
of a tie rod adjustment. 

The Camber adjustment, however, can only be adjusted by a replacement of the 
upper control arm (wishbone). The control arm is available in three possible part 
numbers. One of which is the standard (zero) arm, while the other two are offset 
to effect a small Camber change if needed.

Rear Suspension History 


As requirements for improved performance continue to increase, rear axle technology 
must also be continually enhanced. Throughout the development of various BMW 
Group vehicles, the rear axle has continually evolved to meet the overall needs of 
chassis design. 

Throughout the various design changes, rear axles have allowed improvements in 
traction and stability. The rear axles have also been “weight optimized” which allows 
for an overall balanced chassis. 

The rear axle designs have also made it possible to decrease changes in rear camber 
and toe during suspension travel. By limiting camber and toe changes, the tire can 
maintain a better contact patch, thereby improving rear end stability and improved 
tire wear. 



E65/E66 Rear Axle (Integral IV) 
Shown with ARS and Rear Air Suspension. 


Some of the other improvements to rear axle design include the complete isolation of 
the rear axle through rubber bushings. This decreases the incidence of the transmission 
of road noise into the vehicle’s body and provides superior ride smoothness. 

The chart on the next page list the various rear axle designs on BMW vehicles through 
the last few decades of production vehicles.

HA1 - Semi-Trailing Arm Axle 

The illustration below shows a semi-trailing arm axle used on some of the early BMW 
models. As with all of the rear axle designs covered in this training module, this is a type 
of independent rear suspension. The suspension consists of two trailing arms connected 
to the rear axle beam (subframe). 

The final drive and rear axle beam are connected to the unibody structure via three 
rubber mounts. These mounts serve to insulate drivetrain and suspension noises from 
the body structure. 

There are coil springs which are mounted on the trailing arms. The upper portion of the 
coil springs use a rubber insulating pad which rests on the body structure. 

The dampers are mounted to the hub carrier and the upper end attaches to the body. 
There is an “anti-roll” bar which attaches to the control arms via links. 

The trailing arms on this type of suspension travel in a circular path. This causes 
changes to rear camber and rear toe as the suspension travels through “jounce 
and rebound” motions. 

Future variations of BMW suspension system improve this action resulting in less 
camber and toe changes. 



36 

BMW Suspension Systems 




HA2 - Semi-Trailing Arm Axle (with Track Link) 

This rear suspension design is mostly similar to the previous Semi-trailing arm axle. It is 
sometimes referred to as the “screw-link” or “helical-link” axle. The primary change is 
the installation of a “track-link”. This limits the total travel arc of the trailing arm from 20 
degrees to 13 degrees. This reduces the camber and toe changes. 

The spring was moved from the trailing arm to the damper. This rear axle is used on the 
E23, E24, E32 and E34. Both versions of the semi-trailing arm axle cannot be adjusted 
via standard methods. 




If a toe correction is required, there are offset bushings available 
through parts. For more information, refer to repair instructions 
in WebTIS or the Alignment section of this training course. 


37 

BMW Suspension Systems 











HA3 - Central “C” Link 


E46 Rear Suspension 

The rear suspension design on the E46 is a further development of the “Central Link” 
rear axle. The following modifications were carried out to optimize weight reduction and 
improve noise characteristics: 

• The upper lateral link is now made from aluminum. 

• The subframe (rear axle carrier) is now made from tubular steel. 

• The differential is mounted to the frame with an hydraulic mount. 



The central link rear axle optimizes the following properties: 

• Directional stability 

• Alternating load response 

• Self-steering response 

• Lane change stability 

• Transition response from cornering to straight ahead 

• Rolling comfort 



The designation HA3 does not refer to the three links but rather 
is a continuation of the development designation at BMW. 


38 

BMW Suspension Systems 




E83 Rear Suspension 

The Central Link rear suspension has been adapted to the E83. The rear suspension 
is a further modification of the design used on the E46/16 (AWD/xi Models). 

The E46/16 rear suspension has been adapted to the E83 as follows: 

• Anti-roll bar secured to the rear axle carrier by clamps. 

• Front of rear axle carrier suspension converted to special bolts 
with additional thrust washer. 

• Thrust brace and tension arms. 

• Surface of control arms are galvanized steel plates. 

• Anti-roll bar link with ball joint attached directly to the control arm. 

• Dampers with three point flange (bolt) plate.

When removing or lowering the rear axle, the handbrake cables 
(routed through the rear axle carrier and the body console) must 
be disengaged before the rear axle is lowered. This is to prevent 
shearing of the handbrake cables.

E85 Rear Suspension 

The rear suspension on the E85 is taken from the E46 with some minor changes for the 
roadster. The track width has been increased by 30 mm. A reinforcement plate has been 
added to increase rigidity. Due to underbody aerodynamics, a duct has been added to 
direct airflow to the differential. The differential cover has cooling fins to help keep the 
differential within the proper temperature range.

Rear Suspension Adjustments (HA3 Central Link Axle) 



Rear Toe 

Toe is adjusted by moving the forward central arm bushing mount with a special tool. 
The tool part number varies between models. Tool number 32 3 080 is used for the 
E36. The E46, E8, E83, E89 use tool # 32 3 030. These tools are not used for the 
318ti and Z3 as the rear suspensions on the vehicles are different (HA-1). 



Rear Camber 

Rear Camber is adjusted by rotating an eccentric bolt located at the outer end of the 
rear lower lateral link. No Special tools are required to make the Camber adjustment. 


41 

BMW Suspension Systems 























Integral Axle (III and IV) 

The “integral axle” is a multi-link rear suspension which was introduced on the E31. 
Subsequent variations of this design have been utilized on the 5 and 7 series vehicles 
including the E53 SAV and E39 Sportwagon. These suspensions incorporate what is 
called “elastokinematics” that allow each wheel to move and flex individually without 
loads and forces through the subframe to the opposing wheel. 

The integral axle has been used on the following vehicles: 

• E31 (8-series all models) 

• E38 (7-series all models) 

• E39 (5-series all models) 

• E53 (X5 all models) 

• E52 (Z8) 

• E6x vehicles (including E65, E66, E60, E61, E63 and E64) 

• X Series vehicles (including E70, E71, E72) 

E31 Rear Suspension (Integral III) 

The first BMW vehicle to use the “multi-link” Integral III rear suspension was the E31. 
The E31 version of this suspension uses a 5-link design rather than the subsequent 
4-link design of later models. 

The “fifth-link” was the trailing arm which was deleted as of the E38 and E39 models. 
The E31 design placed the rear springs between the body and the upper lateral link. 
When introduced, this suspension was very innovative for it’s time and provided 
improved directional stability and marked an advance in driving comfort. Future models 
reaped many benefits from this suspension design.

E38 / E39 Rear Suspension (Integral IV) 

The E38 and E39 models use a modified version of the E31 multi-link rear suspension 
system. The system was modified to be more compact yet provide the same handling 
and ride characteristics as the E31 system. 

The trailing arm was eliminated and all suspension mountings are done to the sub-frame 
of the vehicle. The springs were moved to the dampers. The changes from the E31 pro¬ 
vided further improvements to the integral rear axle including weight savings and 
improved noise characteristics.

E39 / E53 Rear Suspension (Integral IV) 

The E39 Sportwagon/E53 X5 rear suspension is the “integral” multi-link design taken 
from the E38/E39 vehicles. Several components are made from aluminum to reduce 
the unsprung weight. The X5 has the optional EHC or EHC II dual axle air suspension. 

The rear axle sub-frame is mounted to the body through four bushings (larger than E38) 
for increased load and comfort. The rear differential is mounted through three rubber 
bushings, two in the front and one hydro-mount in the rear. The wheel bearings are 
similar to the E39 but incorporate different seals - designed for off-road use. 

Integral IV Rear Axle 



The E39 Sportwagon shares the same basic rear suspension design as the E53 X5. 

The standard rear suspension of the E39 Sport wagon follows the design characteristics 
of the four link elastokinematic system of the E38/E39 sedan vehicles. 

The main design difference is the separation of the coil springs and dampers. 

• The coil springs are positioned between the perches of the wheel carriers 
and the underside of the rear floor pan. 

• The shock absorbers are positioned diagonally between the lower lateral 
control arm and the rear axle sub frame. 


44 

BMW Suspension Systems 




This configuration provides the wide, uniform load space in the cargo area. 

Since the shock absorbers are now mounted directly to the sub frame, the sport wagon 
reguires unigue sub frame hydro mounts. The hydro mounts contain a fluid that helps to 
suppress road/suspension noise and vibrations from transmitting into the vehicle body.

E6x Rear Suspension (Integral IV) 

The rear suspension of the E6x vehicles which include the 5, 6 and 7 series vehicles 
remained mostly unchanged. The design is a slightly modified version of the Integral 
IV rear axle from the previous generation 5 and 6 series. 

Provisions have been made to accommodate the Active Roll Stabilization System, the 
rear air suspension system (EHC) and the Electronic Damping Control System (EHC). 

The subframe assembly continues to be made from aluminum. Otherwise, the rear 
suspension is very similar to previous designs.

Rear Suspension Adjustments (Integral Rear Axle lll/IV) 

The integral rear axles (III and IV) have accommodations for the adjustment of both rear 
Toe and rear Camber angle. The adjustments consist of eccentrics that can be adjust¬ 
ed using standard hand tools. The only exception is the E53 X5, which due to space 
limitations needs special wrenches to access the toe eccentric.

HA3 - Central “C” Link - E89 Rear Suspension 

A version of the rear axle known from the E85 (See Rear Axle History section) with the 
development designation HA 3 (Central Link) is fitted in the E89 Z4. 

The Central Link rear axle is an intricately constructed, weight and space saving, multi¬ 
link rear axle. The wheels are controlled by two control arms and one semi-trailing arm 
that is mounted at the central point on the body. The precise interaction between the 
semi-trailing arm and control arm ensures that the wheels remain in the best possible 
position with respect to the road surface, thus providing outstanding directional stability. 
The flexible link bushings ensure exceptional driving stability while cornering, providing 
the vehicle with excellent rolling and acoustic comfort.

HA 5 Rear Axle 


The new HA 5 rear axle is the newest development in rear axle technology. Although this 
design was first installed on the E87 1 Series (not sold in the US). It was introduced to 
the US market with the launch of the E90 3-Series and has since been installed in the 
E82, E88, F25, F30 and E84. 

Designed as a multi-link independent rear suspension axle with 5 different link arms it 
is also referred to as five-link rear axle. The designation "HA 5" does not refer to the five 
links but rather represents the consecutive development designation used at BMW. 

As compared to the HA 3 and HA 4 rear axle, which were made mostly from aluminum, 
the HA 5 rear axle is made primarily from high strength steel. The wheel carrier is cast 
from GGG 40. 



E90 HA 5 Rear Suspension 


Minor differences exist between the HA 5 link rear axle versions depending 
on the vehicle: 

• On the xDrive versions the wheel carrier is modified slightly as it utilizes 
bigger wheel bearings. 

• In all variants the rear axle transmission mounting is matched to the 
relevant drivetrain.

Advantages 

Compared to previous rear axles the HA 5 offers the following advantages: 

Manufacturing Costs 

The lower costs are attributed to the fact that the use of high strength steel has 
made it possible to reduce the wall thicknesses of the rear axle carrier and the links. 

Compared to the Integral IV, a considerable cost saving measure has been utilized 
by manufacturing the entire axle from high strength steel plus the weight of the HA 5 
rear axle is not excessively high. 

Light Construction 

A bending moment occurs only in the camber link, as it provides the support function 
for the spring and damper. The remaining four links are not subjected to moments of 
force thereby enabling a lightweight and rigid design. 

Thanks to the straight design of the links and the connection by means of ball joints, 
except for the camber link, the wheel control with this axle is subject to only minimal 
elasticity and is very precise. 

Production 

The HA 5 rear axle can be completely pre-assembled and adjusted with the brake 
system as well as the suspension and damping. 

Kinematics 

The very small positive kingpin offset guarantees less sensitivity to longitudinal forces 
even in connection with wide tires. 

The relatively large caster ensures a defined degree of lateral force understeering and 
therefore improves vehicle handling/stabilization and offers faster response. 

The change in toe as part of the suspension action enables outstanding directional 
stability with a relatively short wheelbase and exceptional self-steering characteristics 
while cornering. 

The change in camber as part of the suspension action is selected in order to establish 
an optimum camber with respect to the road surface while cornering. 

The long toe link has a positive effect on the toe-in characteristics over the spring 
travel range. 

A low roll center has a particularly beneficial effect on the rolling motion. 

The "propping" effect while cornering has been largely minimized by improving 
the roll center change rate. 


53 

BMW Suspension Systems 



The braking support has been set to 70%. Racing cars generally have a support angle 
of 0% in order to constantly achieve maximum contact force. On these vehicles, the 
disadvantage of a dive motion while braking and starting off is compensated by the 
taut suspension. The braking support (anti-dive) realized on the E90 represents an 
optimum compromise between comfort, safety and driving dynamics requirements. 

The use of five links enables free selection of the pivot axle for the design layout. This 
means that the movement of the wheel in interaction with the suspension can be opti¬ 
mized without compromise under braking, acceleration and lateral forces. This largely 
determines all important variables such as toe, camber, brake support (anti-dive) angle, 
roll center and roll center change rate. 

Crash Requirements 

The HA 5 rear axle permits a considerably more favorable progression of the side 
member, resulting in specific advantages particularly at low impact speeds. 

Added to this, the large rear axle carrier is connected directly to the rigid frame side 
member, allowing it to transmit the applied crash forces more favorably. The semi-trailing 
arm features crash beading (in the semi-trailing arm of the HA 5 rear axle) to ensure the 
fuel tank is not damaged. 

Rigidity / Acoustics 

The rear axle carrier of the HA 5 rear axle extends up to the rigid frame side members 
of the body with its axle mounting points and even up to the sill with its thrust rods. This 
provides a very large support face for the applied forces and moments. The resulting 
advantages include, considerably lower stress and strain on the body (rear axle break¬ 
away) and the option of designing the rear axle bearing mounts relatively soft. This 
arrangement and the double flexible mounting, provide outstanding insulation against 
road noise and tire rolling noise.

Minor differences exist between the HA 5 versions being used on the E9X and E82 
variants. The rear axle of the E82 is fitted with modified wheel hubs. As a result, the 
rear track width of the E82 has been widened by 20mm in comparison to the E9X. 

The extended rear wheel arches, combined with the wider rear track width emphasizes 
this vehicle's rear-wheel drive characteristics. 


The springs and dampers differ from those in the E90 in that they have been adapted 
to the E82’s vehicle weight. The front axle of the E82 is fitted with a hollow-type anti-roll 
bar for weight reduction and a sport tuned suspension is available as an option on the 
BMW 128i (standard equipment on BMW 135i).

F25 Rear Suspension 

The HA 5 five-link rear axle installed in the F25 is derived from a double wishbone rear 
axle with rear mounted track rod. Although the engineering design principle of the rear 
axle is based on the one used in the E8x and E9x vehicles, this version is characterized 
by its low installation space reguirement and light weight of its components.

The terminology has changed due to the design changes implement

In addition to a particularly precise wheel control, this design delivers outstanding driving 
dynamics in relation to the following: 

• Directional stability, accuracy 

• Load change response 

• Self-steering response 

• Lane change stability 

• Steering movement (transitional response from cornering to straight-ahead driving). 

In contrast to the E84 and E9x series, spring struts are installed at the rear axle instead 
of the split arrangement of springs/dampers. A high suspension ratio has been achieved 
through the installation of spring struts. 

The optimized elastokinematics ensures ride comfort as the use of small but effective 
control arms means that the rear axle hardly reacts to interference. 

The flat space-saving design of the axle with wide spring struts mounted on the outside 
results in a flat luggage compartment floor with generous loading width. 

Low unsprung masses have been implemented using innovative sheet-metal control 
arm technology. 

F30 Rear Suspension 

F30 rear suspension is a five-link rear axle (HA5) design which is also based on the E90 
now has a steel construction and has been significantly enhanced. 

The elastokinematics installed in the five-link rear axle have been coordinated specifically 
to the F30 chassis. 

Precise and superior wheel control is possible in all driving situations due to the large 
spring travel range. Therefore it has been possible to resolve the conflicting objectives 
of driving dynamics and comfort by: 

• The flexible suspension of rear axle differential at rear axle support and the flexible 
bushing of rear axle support at body (2x flexible bushings) have been specifically 
coordinated to the F30 chassis. 

• Maximum support base width for the rear axle support. 

• Significant increase in track width when compared to E90. 

• Optimum connection of body suspension and damping.

E84 Rear Suspension 

A five-link rear axle HA 5 as known from the 1 series and 3 Series is also installed 
in both E84 models (sDrive/xDrive). 

The HA5 in the BMW XI otters enhanced comfort due to a double-elastic bushings 
and a large rear axle support base. Furthermore, the design principle of the HA5 is 
light weight and very compact. 

The five-link rear axle is mainly derived from a twin control arm rear axle with the track 
rod located in the rear, whereby the upper and lower A-arms were replaced by two indi¬ 
vidual arms each. The advantage of this is that, regardless of the installation space situa¬ 
tion, it is possible to freely specify the effective virtual kinematics point. The result of this 
design coordination is elastokinematic properties that permit exact wheel control across 
significant spring travel, which is required for the desired driving properties. In addition, 
due to small effective lever arms, the rear axle barely reacts to road interferences. 

The large support base for toe and camber on the wheel carrier side and the extremely 
rigid trailer arms, as well as the stiff rear axle support and the connection to the body by 
means of strut rods ensure highly precise wheel control. This is the prerequisite for agile 
overall coordination of the BMW XI. The use of high-torque engines and the properties 
of the run-flat tires were taken into consideration when designing the large rear axle sup¬ 
port base resulting in enhanced driving properties as well as superior sound insulation. 

The BMW XI uses many of the rear axle components of the BMW 3-Series Touring 
(E91). The hub carrier and the upper wishbone were redesigned (due to the height 
difference in the BMW XI) as well as the rear axle support rear cross member (with 
the connection for camber link and toe link); the remaining components are identical 
to the rear axle support in the BMW 3-Series Touring. 

The HA5 provides the best prerequisites for the particularly space-saving rear concept 
(location of rear seat position, fuel tank, and luggage compartment). Thus, a comparably 
large through-loading width as well as ample legroom can be achieved in the rear.

Integral IV - E7x Rear Suspension 

The rear suspension in the E70 is a further-developed integral IV design based on the 
E53 rear axle. It is characterized by improved driving dynamics without compromising 
comfort and driving safety. With this axle it was possible to increase the width and depth 
of the load area compared to the previous design (See Rear Axle History section). 

The result is a considerably larger and more functional load space (third row of seats) 
particularly through the use of the single-axle air spring (rear axle air suspension). This 
design layout guarantees brilliant road handling characteristics irrespective of the vehicle 
load and at a constant ride height. 

Safety functions are defined by the superior vehicle control characteristics. Effective 
de-coupling of the road and drivetrain guarantees outstanding levels of acoustic and 
vibration comfort.

The dynamic and drive forces applied through the wheel contact point into the suspen¬ 
sion are taken up by the wheel carrier, rear axle carrier and four control arms. The design 
layout reduces the flexible pulling action in the wheel carrier and therefore enables 
lengthways damping of the wheel control, which is important for rolling comfort, by 
means of soft front link brackets on the rear axle carrier. 

Due to the position of the spring on the wheel carrier, it is no longer necessary to sup¬ 
port the weight of the vehicle on the rubber mounts on the rear axle carrier. The opti¬ 
mum lengthwise damping and the favorable spring position facilitate effective isolation 
of rolling and drive noise while significantly contributing to the refined smooth and guiet 
vehicle running characteristics.

Compared to the E53, the rear axle of the E70 was adapted to the requirements of 
the larger dimensions, higher overall weight, increased power/torque, the BMW run 
flat safety system and the demanding objectives in terms of driving dynamics and 
comfort. The main criteria that governed the selection of materials included: 
component weight, production process (cold forming, casting properties, welding 
properties), strength and deformation characteristics as well as corrosion resistance 
The resulting advantages include: 

• Outstanding driving dynamics, further increased compared to the E53, 
without compromising comfort and driving safety. 

• Distinctly larger and more functional load area by increasing the effective 
load width and depth. 

• Level control (1 -axis air suspension) ensures constant ride-height and 
driving characteristics irrespective of the vehicle load. 

These design enhancements have been carried over to all current E7x vehicles 
and served as a base for the development of the Integral V rear axle use in current 
FOx/FIx vehicles.

camber adjustment. Always refer to repair instruction available

Integral V - FOx / Fix Rear Suspension 

The Integral V rear axle design was introduced with the launch of the F01/02 in late 
2008. This suspension design differs from the previous 7 Series (E65) which used the 
familiar and already proven “Integral IV” (The Integral IV rear axle design was introduced 
on the E38 in 1995 and has been in use on subseguent 5, 6 and 7 series models as 
well as in X6 and both generations of the X5). 

Safety functions are defined by the superior vehicle control characteristics. Effective 
decoupling of the road and drive train guarantees outstanding levels of acoustic and 
vibration comfort. 

The Integral V rear axle has been specifically tuned to the specific reguirements 
of the FOx/FIx vehicles like: 

• Larger vehicle dimensions 

• Greater total weight 

• Greater drive output 

• Higher drive torgue 

• Runflat tires. 

Design Features 

The demanding objectives related to driving dynamics and comfort have been 
correspondingly adapted while integrating the reguired driving dynamics systems. 

The Integral V rear axle primarily fulfils the driving dynamics functions of the mechanical 
chassis and suspension, i.e. define elastokinematic wheel control in all relevant driving 
situations. 

The innovative BMW development of the Integral Active Steering (IAL), however, makes 
specific demands in terms of the elastokinematics of the integral-V rear axle: To a 
certain extent, the wheels on the rear axle must be able to execute steering movements. 

Kinematics and Elastokinematics 

The spatial arrangement of the pivot points or pivot axes of the arms and links is known 
as kinematics. This term applies to components that are assumed to be non-deformable. 

Elastokinematics takes into account the flexibility at least of the rubber-metal mounts, 
often of the ball joints and rarely of the components. 

Various arms define the horizontal plane of the rear axle wheel suspension at the axle 
carrier and the wheel carrier. These arms are mounted such that they can rotate about 
an approximately horizontal axis of rotation and therefore allow vertical movement of 
the wheel carrier. 


63 

BMW Suspension Systems 



Kinematics is primarily of significance in terms of vehicle handling. The kinematics is 
arranged in such a way that defined camber and toe-in angles are achieved between 
the wheel and road surface in response to the suspension and steering. 

Kinematics is superimposed by elastokinematic effects. These elastokinematic effects 
occur as the movement points and movement axles are spatially displaced by the effect 
of the forces at the wheel. 

New Challenge for the Integral Rear Axle - Integral Active Steering 

In terms of the F01/F02, the development of integral active steering (IAL) as a BMW 
driving dynamics innovation, posed a completely new challenge to the engineers and the 
tried and tested integral IV rear axle. The integral active steering is made up of the active 
steering and the rear axle slip angle control (HSR).

The principle of the Integral V rear axle makes it possible to resolve the conflict between 
driving dynamics and comfort. The dynamic and drive forces applied through the wheel 
contact point into the wheel suspension are taken up by the wheel carrier, rear axle 
carrier, three links and an A-arm (swinging arm).

The design layout reduces the flexible pulling action in the wheel carrier and therefore 
enables lengthways damping of the wheel control, which is important for rolling comfort, 
by means of axially soft front link mounts on the rear axle carrier. 

Thanks to the position of the spring on the wheel carrier, it is no longer necessary 
to support the weight of the vehicle on the rubber mounts on the rear axle carrier. 

This optimum spring position in conjunction with specific lengthways control guarantees 
effective isolation of rolling and drive noise while significantly contributing to the refined 
smooth and guiet vehicle running characteristics. 


65 

BMW Suspension Systems 




















The main criteria that governed the selection of materials included component weight, 
production process (cold forming, casting properties, welding properties), strength and 
deformation characteristics as well as corrosion resistance. 

Two versions of the Integral V rear axle are available. Bearing assemblies are fitted 
on the two track rods if the vehicle is not equipped with integral active steering. 

The revolutionary further development of the Integral IV rear axle culminates in the BMW 
patented Integral V rear axle. The new arrangement of the arms and links as well as the 
use of ball joints facilitates a rear axle with steering capabilities.

Viewing the arrangement of the arms and links in the Integral IV rear axle of the E65 
(above) it is difficult to imagine that defined steering movement of the rear wheels 
about the Z-Axis could be realized.

BMW Suspension Systems 




















Theoretically, i.e. kinematically, the design of the Integral IV rear axle could facilitate 
steering capabilities, however a large actuator would’ve been required and it would’ve 
required additional engineering design. Ultimately it would’ve also been decisively 
heavier and more expensive, hence the Integral V rear axle.

Summary of the design layout: 

• The system consists of a wheel carrier that is controlled from below by 
a torsionally rigid A-arm (swinging arm). 

• At the bottom, the wheel carrier is connected directly by means of a first bearing 
mount and indirectly by means of a second bearing mount, in connection with an 
integral link arranged vertically with respect to the plane of the A-arm (swinging 
arm), to the wheel carrier. 

• The two rubber mounts on the inside of the vehicle are connected to the rear 
axle carrier such that they are torsionally soft and can be displaced axially. 

• The upper transverse control arm lies approximately in the vertical plane 
of the drive shaft and therefore also at the center point of the wheel. 

• The rear track rod arranged approximately at the center point of the wheel 
is either mounted on the rear axle carrier or connected to the actuator of 
the integral active steering. 



The track and camber at the rear axle can still be adjusted by 
means of two eccentric screws, however, a new procedure 
must be observed!

Suspension Options (Integral V) 

The standard chassis and suspension system of the F01 features steel springs on 
the front and rear axle. The standard chassis and suspension on F02 and F07 has 
steel springs on the front axle with the single axle air suspension (EHC) fitted on the 
rear axle. The F01/F02, is eguipped as standard with vertical dynamics control 
featuring electronically.

are available: 

• Standard suspension with single axle air spring. 

• Dynamic drive with steel springs and VDC dampers. 

• Dynamic drive with 2 steel springs and single axle air spring and VDC dampers. 

Beginning with the F10 however conventional spring struts on the front and rear axles 
are installed as standard equipment with EDC/VDC dampers available as an option.
