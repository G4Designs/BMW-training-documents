DVOM 


Introducing the DVOM 

The ability to measure voltage, current flow, and resistance is important in the diagnosing 
of electrical problems. Without the results of these measurements troubleshooting in an 
electrical system is a futile process. 

The instrument most commonly used to make electrical measurements is called the 
Digital Voltage-Ohm Meter (DVOM). 


Basic DVOM’s are capable of measuring: 

• AC Voltage 

• 

DC Voltage 

• Millivolts 

• 

Resistance 

• Conductance 

• 

Capacitance 

• Continuity 

• 

Diode Test 

• Amps/Milliamps 

Advanced DVOM’s add: 

• 

Microamps 

• Frequency 

• 

RPM 

• Duty Cycle 

• 

Pulse Width 



The DVOM provides for a method of accurate measurements. 

Even though accurate measurements are the key to electrical diagnosis, the following 
four factors determine the effectiveness of the measurements: 

• Accuracy of the measuring instrument. 

• Correct installation in the circuit of the measuring instrument. 

• Ability of the Technician to read the instrument. 

• Skill of the Technician in interpreting the results. 

As it is clearly seen, only one of the factors depends on the DVOM (e.g. accuracy), the 
rest will always depend the ability of the technician to read and interpret the results. 


Choosing a DVOM 

A good choice of a DVOM is the DISplus or the GT1, as the measuring system of each 
contains a highly accurate DVOM. 

Choosing a handheld DVOM from a reputable manufacturer, however, leaves the DISplus 
and GT1 free to perform other tasks that a DVOM can not do (e.g. Retrieval of fault 
codes).

DVOM 



















In choosing a DVOM several factors need to be considered, one of which is Impedance. 

Impedance is the combined resistance to current created by the resistance, capacitance 
and inductance of the meter. Impedance is measured in ‘Ohms per Volt’. 

Meters with the highest ‘Ohms per Volt’ impedance are the most accurate. More 
importantly using a meter with high impedance will not cause damage to sensitive 
electronic circuitry. 

When a Meter is connected across a circuit to measure voltage, it must be connected in 
parallel. This adds parallel resistance. The total resistance in a parallel circuit is less than 
the lowest resistance in that circuit (Ohms Law). Using a Meter with low impedance will 
reduce the total resistance of the circuit and allow more current to flow. 

A meter with low impedance can draw enough current to cause inaccurate measurement, 
voltage drops or damage sensitive electronic circuit boards. A high impedance meter will 
draw little current and insure accurate readings. 

Using older type meters with low impedance values (20,000 to 30,000 ohms-per-volt) 
can damage modern electronic circuits and components or give inaccurate readings. 

Test lights should be avoided for the same reason. They lower the total resistance of the 
circuit and cause increased current flow. 

Other factors in choosing the proper DVOM are: 

• Cost 

• Features 

Basic DVOM’s are available reasonably priced. These basic models may be more than 
sufficient for use in BMW Centers, given the availability of the DISplus and GT1 for 
advanced measurement and scope functions. 

Advanced features and price go hand in hand. The more features added the higher the 
cost. Some of those features may be worth the increase in cost (e.g. frequency, duty 
cycle and pulse width). Other features may not (e.g. oscilloscope, graphing). 

Choose a DVOM wisely based on personal preference and cost. Like many other tools it 
is valuable in the diagnosis and repair of BMW’s. Experience has shown if the technician 
is not comfortable with the DVOM or confident in the results of the measurements, the 
DVOM will not be used. 

Considering the technology in BMW automobiles, diagnosing with a quality DVOM cer¬ 
tainly makes repairing the problem correctly and expediently a more manageable task.

Infinity Display 

While most displays of DVOMs are standard (i.e. mV means millivolt, mA means mil- 
liamp) the display or symbol for infinity or open circuit can be confusing. A display of OW 
indicates no or little resistance. It means the circuit or portion of the circuit being mea¬ 
sured has continuity or is complete. A reading of OL means the circuit is open or not 
complete, the resistance is said to be “INFINITY”. Some meters may use the symbol B 
for Infinity. Be aware of which reading the meter being used will give for infinity or open 
circuit.

Using the DVOM 


Voltage Testing 

The voltmeter (DVOM) must be connected in parallel with the load or circuit. 

The DVOM has a high resistance and taps off a small amount of current. 

A voltmeter must be used with the current on and with the correct polarity. 

The red lead should be connected to the B+ side of the circuit and the black lead to the 
B- side of the circuit. 

If the leads are reversed the reading will be a negative number. 

• Select proper function and range of DVOM. 

• Connect (-) lead of meter to battery B- or known good ground. 

• Connect (+) lead of meter to test circuit. 


DVOM will indicate supply or available voltage at that point. 


Typical Application of Voltage 
Testing 

• Checking Power Supply. 

• Charging System. 

• Complete Basic Circuits. 

• Control Module Functions 
(Input/Output). 


Measure at different points checking for 
change or interruption in the voltage supply.

DVOM 
























Amperage Testing 

To measure amperage the meter must be installed in series in the circuit. The current 
flow of the circuit must flow through the meter itself. 

Current must be flowing in the circuit. 

Installing the meter in parallel with the circuit may cause damage to the meter, because 
of the increased current flow in the circuit, due to the low resistance in the meter. 

Caution: Most ampere meters or DVOMs are rated for no more than 10 amps. 
Current flow above 10 amps will damage the internal fuse of the DVOM and render it 
unable to measure amperage. 

• Select proper function of DVOM and move leads to proper position. 

• Connect meter in series with (+) lead on the B + side of the circuit. 

• Connect (-) lead of meter to complete circuit. 

DVOM will indicate current flow (Amps) through circuit. 


Typical Application of Amperage 
Testing 

• Proper Component Operation 
(Correct Current Draw). 

• Parasitic Draw Testing. 


Ensure meter is capable of handling current flow.

DVOM 














Resistance Testing 

When set for resistance testing (Ohms) the DVOM must never be connected in a live circuit. 

The component or portion of a circuit being measured, must be isolated from the power 
source. 

Most modern day DVOM’s are self ranging when set to measure resistance, so the meter 
can not be damaged by out of range measurements. 

The test leads may be used without regard for polarity, unless the circuit contains a diode. 

The DVOM functions by placing a very small amount of current on the circuit being test¬ 
ed, the red lead must be placed on the anode side of the diode. 

• Select correct function and range (Most meters are self ranging in this function). 

• Disconnect power to circuit. 

• Disconnect any circuit wired in parallel with circuit being tested. 

• Connect test leads. 


DVOM will indicate resistance (Ohms) of component or circuit being tested. 






Continuity Testing 

The DVOM uses its own internal power supply to test the continuity of the circuit. The 
DVOM must never be connected in a live circuit. Any circuits wired in parallel with the cir¬ 
cuit being tested must also be disconnected. 

Continuity testing verifies that circuit connections are intact. The continuity mode is 
extremely fast and is used to detect either shorts or opens that last as little as 1 ms. 

When a change is detected the beeper tone is stretched to last at least 1/4 second so 
both shorts and opens can be audibly detected. 

This is a valuable troubleshooting aid when diagnosing intermittent faults associated with 
wiring, connections, switches and other components of the circuit. 

• Select correct function and range of DVOM. 

• Disconnect power to the circuit. 

• Disconnect any circuits wired in parallel. 

• Connect DVOM leads to the circuit to be tested. 

DVOM display will indicate continuity of circuit.

DVOM 
























Voltage Drop Testing 

Voltage Drop Tests determine the resistance of an active circuit, a circuit with current 
flowing. 

Voltage drop tests are preferred over simple resistance measurements because the 
power source is not removed from the circuit. 

By measuring the voltage on both sides of a load, the amount of voltage consumed by 
the load is measured. 

The voltage drops of each part of a series circuit added together must equal the power 
supply for that circuit while it is active. 

• Select proper function and range of DVOM. 

• Connect (+) lead to the B+ side of the circuit or component being tested. 

• Connect (-) lead to the B- side of the circuit or component. 

DVOM display will indicate the voltage drop in the circuit tested between the 
DVOM leads. 


Typical Application of Voltage Drop 
Testing 

• Determine proper component 
operation. 

• Active circuit continuity 

• Active circuit resistance. 



As a “Dynamic” test with the circuit operational, 
a voltage drop in any non-resistive part of the 
circuit indicates a fault in the circuit.

Tip on Using a DVOM 

Inspect test leads and replace 
damaged leads. 

Do not use a meter if it looks dam¬ 
aged. 

Select the proper range and func¬ 
tion for your test. 

Disconnect the live test lead before 
disconnecting the common lead. 

When measuring current, turn the 
power off in the circuit before con¬ 
necting the meter. 

Check meter fuse(s). 



Note: Some meters may have leads and functions in different locations. 
Explanation of features can be obtained in their Users Manual.
