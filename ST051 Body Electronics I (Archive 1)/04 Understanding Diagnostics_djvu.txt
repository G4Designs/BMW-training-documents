Understanding Diagnostics 


Trial and error creates inconvenience for the Customer and the Service Department 
when misdiagnosis or longer waits occur as the technician tries different repair attempts. 
This is against MINI’S promise to the customer to “Fix it right the first time, on time, every 
time”. 

If the vehicle is not repaired efficiently the productivity of the technician suffers. Taking 
some time at the beginning to plan a diagnostic course of action can help give structure 
to what may appear in the beginning to be a chaotic situation. 

As future systems increase in complexity so does their dependency on the Diagnosis 
Program as the principle tool fortroubleshooting. However, the importance of under¬ 
standing the calculated steps of a basic troubleshooting plan is just as important as 
before. 

There will always be instances where the Test Modules provided by the DISplus need to 
be supplemented by a thoughtful diagnostic plan that is created by the skilled technician. 
A parallel diagnostic plan that includes proper recording of test data along with the 
Diagnosis Program is a good habit to follow every time that troubleshooting is reguired. 

A successful diagnostic plan will: 

• Save repair time. 

• Satisfy the customer by reducing vehicle down time. 

• Increase Center profitability. 

• Increase technician pride and earnings. 

Diagnostic Plan 

The Diagnostic Plan consists of 5 steps: 

• Verify the Customer Complaint -“Experience the Symptom!” 

• Analyze the Problem. 

• Isolate the Problem. 

• Repair the Problem. 

• Verify the Repair. 

Verify the Customer Complaint: Experience the symptom! 

Most troubleshooting starts the moment you receive a written description of the cus¬ 
tomer complaint. The complaint is the customer’s description of a symptom that they 
are experiencing with the vehicle. 

Symptom 

A symptom is any circumstance, event or condition that accompanies something and 
indicates its existence or occurrence.

There may be multiple symptoms that are created with one problem. 

An example is a defective thermostat: If the thermostat is stuck open the the heater out¬ 
put will be insufficient, also, if the engine can never reach operating temperature then fuel 
mileage and performance will suffer. Which one of these complaints (symptoms) would 
lead you to the problem faster? 

What is important to remember is that the customer may only complain about one symp¬ 
tom. It is the job of the technician to be a detective and carefully observe. There may be 
another symptom not complained of that directly points to the root cause of the problem. 

Steps to Verify the Complaint 

• Before getting in the vehicle, review the R.O., confirm this is the correct vehicle. 

• Is any additional information needed about the complaint? Certain guestions to the 
customer can help narrow this step. 

• Is the problem intermittent? What are the conditions (roads, temp., speed, etc.)? 
What is the freguency of the occurrence? 

• Test drive if driveability related or the conditions reguire, duplicate conditions as 
stated by customer. 

• Was the complaint reproduced? 

• Is knowledge of system or vehicle sufficient? 

• Review reference training material and owner’s handbook for a description of fea¬ 
ture operation. 

• Research complaint in SIB’s, 

• Research past repair history on vehicle. 

Analyze the Problem 

After verification of the complaint, analyze the problem. Use all resource available to aid 
in system diagnostics: 

• Vehicle Fault Memory 

• ETM, Repair Manual, SIB 

• Vehicle Repair History 

• Training Handouts 

• Round Table Information 

• Hotline 

• Known Good Vehicle 

Analyzing the problem allows for the development of a repair plan.

Steps in Analyzing the Problem 

• Perform a Short Test. 

• Does an SIB pertain to this vehicle? 

• Refer to the Function Description for additional system information. 

• Is a test plan available for this system? 

• Use fault symptom selection. 

• Perform Diagnosis Request. 

Isolate the Problem 

To isolate the problem is “ to place apart from others”. 

The object here is to zoom in on the problem area. It is easy to be overwhelmed by a 
problem, just reaching for an ETM can add to the confusion. The DISplus provides auto¬ 
matic tests in test modules to aid in the determination of the exact area or cause of the 
problem. 

The elimination of components from the diagnostic trail, shortens the path. The first 
question asked should be: 

• Is the problem Hydraulic, Mechanical or Electrical? 

Save time by NOT testing components that could not create the problem. 


Steps in Isolating the Problem 

• Use Test Modules. 


• Perform electrical tests with the DISplus Measurement System or a DVOM. 

• Consult fault charts in Repair or Diagnostic Procedures Manuals. 

• Control Module Self Diagnosis. 

• Use appropriate special tools (e.g. battery draw tester, tank leakage adapters, 
breakout boxes, etc.). 

• Substitute a known good part. 



Workshop Hint 


If a TEST PLAN is not available: If a TEST PLAN is available: 

• Think about the system in its entirety. * * Do not skip steps. 

• Be sure the normal operation is understood. * Never assume results without doing a step. 

• Develop a PLAN. • Recheck your work. 

• Use all available resources. 

• Don’t try to diagnose the entire system at 
once, break it into manageable chunks. 

• Check the easy things first. It would waste 
time to install the breakout boxes to find a 
bad bulb.

Repair the Problem 

Repair the problem using approved repair techniques and parts. Having verified, isolated 
and analyzed the problem the last step is to repair or replace the component. Before 
installing that shiny new part, take one last step back from the vehicle to ask a final set of 
questions. 

• Could another component have caused this part to fail? 

• Were all the instructions in the Test Plan or Diagnostic Procedures followed? 

• Is there anything that might have been overlooked? 

Confident that the proper diagnosis has been made, complete the repairs. 

Steps to Repairing the Problem: 

• Follow the instructions in the repair manual. 

• Refer to Construction Groups in the microfiche if necessary. 

• Follow specific guidelines for wire harness repair or replacement. 

• Make proper adjustments after installing the part. 

• Perform Coding or Programming if required. 

• Make sure another problem is not created in performing this repair. 

Verify the Repair 

Always recheck for the complaint under the same conditions used to verify. The object is 
to prove the problem does not resurface. 

• Clear the fault codes. 

• Test drive the car. 

• Check for re-occurring fault codes. 

• Clear adaptations if necessary. 

• Recheck the part installation for missing bolts or tie wraps. 


Workshop Hints 


• Follow repair or replacement procedures 
as detailed in TIS. 

• Use only genuine parts.

The I.P.O. Principle 


Control modules receive information from sensors advising them of certain operating 
conditions. This information is identified as Input to the control modules. The Input con¬ 
tinually informs the control modules of conditions that may be changing. 

The control module then process the Input information comparing it to programmed 
responses or commands based on every possible operating condition. The control 
module decides based on the programming and the Input conditions which output 
signal to operate. 

The control module, based on the processing that has occurred, then sends a signal to a 
component changing the status of that component. The components respond to the 
output signal of the control module. 

This is known as the I.RO. Principle. 



Any device controlled by a processor reguires input to the alert the operating program of 
a condition. The program processes the input information and logically activates an out¬ 
put of a component. 

All BMW control systems are explained by the IPO principle. It is the key to understand¬ 
ing all BMW control system technologies.
