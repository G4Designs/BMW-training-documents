Basic Electricity 

Electricity is defined as the movement of electrons from one atom to another. In order to 
understand electricity a basic explanation of the atom is needed. 

All matter is made up of molecules. An atom is the smallest particle to which a molecule 
can be reduced. 

Atoms consist of: 

Electrons -Negatively charged particles orbiting around a nucleus. 

Protons -Positively charged particles in the nucleus. 

Neutrons -Uncharged particles in the nucleus that stabilize the protons. 


Balanced ion 



Positive ion 


Negative ion 




An atom is balanced or displays a neutral charge when the number of protons and elec¬ 
trons are equal. 

Through various means (e.g. A chemical reaction in the the automotive battery) elec¬ 
trons are displaced from their normal orbit. 

These displaced electrons attach themselves to other atoms, creating an unbalance in 
the number of electrons and protons in both atoms. 

Atoms which loose or repel an electron become positively charged because of the 
greater number of protons. These atoms are called “Positive Ions”. 

Atoms which pickup or gain extra electrons become negatively charged and are called 
“Negative Ions”. 

The negative ions will attempt to repel the extra electron and the positive ions will 
attempt to attract it.

Basic Electricity 















The movement of free electrons from one 
atom to another is called electron flow or elec¬ 
tric current flow. 

This flow of electrons does not mean that a 
single electron travels the entire length of the 
wire. 

Electron flow is the movement of free elec¬ 
trons from atom to atom and the transmission 
of an electrical impulse from one end of a 
conductor to the other. 

The constant unbalancing and rebalancing of 
the atoms takes place in less than one mil¬ 
lionth of a second. 



A single strand of copper wire contains 
billions of atoms

Basic Electricity 
















Electromotive Force 

Friction, light, heat, pressure, chemical reaction or magnetic action are all ways that elec¬ 
trons are freed. The free electrons will move away from the “Electron Moving Force” 
(EMF). A stream of free electrons form an electrical current.

The battery and the generator are the primary and secondary means by which free elec¬ 
trons are generated in automobiles. 


The chemical reaction taking place in the 
battery creates an Electromotive Force (EMF) 
that provides us with the positive ions and 
negative ions. 

The generator through magnetic induction is 
our other source of free electrons. (Positive 
and negative ions) 

The positive ions collect at the positive bat¬ 
tery terminal and the negative ions collect at 
the negative battery terminal. 


Positive Negative 



The positive and negative ions provide no 
energy unless a path between them is estab¬ 
lished. This path is normally in the form of a 
load (e.g. bulb, electric motor or other electri¬ 
cal consumer) placed across the positive and 
negative terminals of the battery either directly 
or through wires. 



6 

Basic Electricity 













































Theory of Electron Flow 

Free electrons are pushed out of the battery 
negative terminal through a conductor to the 
positive terminal.When a path is established 
electrons have a route from the negative termi¬ 
nal to the positive terminal of the battery. 

That route may take the electrons through 
wires, motors, light bulbs or other electrical 
consumers. 

The mission of the electrons is always to 
return to the source of their energy which is 
the battery. 

The Theory of Electron Flow represents the 
actual path of the electrons in an electrical 
circuit, from negative to positive. 



Theory of Electron Flow 


Conventional Theory of Electron Flow 


Before Science gave a glimpse of the electron, 
it was generally believed that electricity (elec¬ 
trons) flowed from the positive charge to the 
negative charge. 

Most electrical symbols, wiring diagrams, and 
teaching is based on the “Conventional Theory 
of Electron Flow” which states that electrons 
flow from positive to negative. 

From this point on all references to current flow 
will be defined by the Conventional Theory of 
Electron Flow. 




Conventional Theory of Electron Flow 

Conventional Theory of Electron Flow, is some¬ 
times referred to as the Automotive Theory of 
Electron Flow.

Basic Electricity 























































Voltage 

The potential of the electrons to flow is measured in Volts. 

Think of voltage as pressure, the driving force (pressure) pushing the electrons from posi¬ 
tive to negative. 



“One volt is the potential difference required to push one Amp of current through one 
Ohm of resistance.” 

Voltage is present between two points when a positive charge exists at one point and a 
negative charge at the other point. 

The amount of voltage available is dependent on the number of ions at each terminal of 
the battery. 



Less Ions 


Less Voltage 



More Ions 


More Voltage 


Voltage is the difference in the potential charges between the positive and negative 
terminals in a battery. If one volt is capable of pushing “x” amount of current, two 
volts can push 2x, three volts 3x and so on.

Basic Electricity 
























Ampere 

The unit of measure for current flow is the 
“Ampere”, commonly referred to as “Amps”. 

Amps is the counting of electrons flowing on 
a conductor past a given point. One amp of 
current flow is egual to 6.23 billion billion 
(6.23 x 10 18 ) electrons moving past a point in 
one second. 

Amps allow you to measure the volume of 
electrical energy “amperes” flowing through 
a wire or electrical consumer. 

Ohms 

The “Resistance” of a circuit opposes 
current flow. The unit of measure for 
resistance is the “Ohm”. 

One ohm is defined as the amount of resis¬ 
tance that will allow one amp to flow when 
being pushed by one volt of pressure. 

Resistance slows the flow of current (reduces 
the number of electrons flowing). 

Resistance changes electrical energy into 
another form of energy (e.g. heat, light or 
motion). 




Resistance reduces the number 
of electrons flowing

Basic Electricity 









































Circuits 

Electricity must have a complete or closed loop circuit to flow. A “Circuit” is defined as 
an unbroken, uninterrupted path which begins and ends at the same point. In the auto¬ 
mobile that point is the battery. The electron flow must be from the battery through the 
wiring and consumers back to the battery. That flow represents a complete circuit. 

A typical circuit will contain: 

1. A battery and/or generator system (EMF or source of the electrons) 

2. Conductors (wiring to deliver the electrons to the consumers) 

3. Consumers (the load being placed on the system) 

Any break or interruption in this circuit will cause the circuit to cease operation. 



There are three basic types of circuits: 

• Series 

• Parallel 

• Series/Parallel 


Series Circuit 

A Series circuit provides one path for the current 
flow. That path is from the source of the current 
(the battery) through a conductor, consumer and 
back to the source. 

A Series circuit provides constant current flow 
(amps) through the entire circuit. Amps measured 
in any two places in the circuit will be equal.

Parallel Circuit 

A Parallel circuit provides multiple current paths. 
In a Parallel circuit, all of the component’s posi¬ 
tive terminals are connected to one point and 
all of the component’s negative terminals are 
connected to a different common point. 

Source voltage is the same at all loads. 

The current flow in a parallel circuit will be egual 
to the sum of the current flowing through each 
branch of the circuit. 


Switch 



Series-Parallel Circuit 

A Series-Parallel circuit contains portions of the 
current path that are in series with each other 
and other portions of the path that are parallel 
with each other. A headlight circuit would typi¬ 
cally be this type of Series/Parallel circuit. The 
headlight switch is in series with the headlights, 
and the headlights are in parallel branches with 
each other. 


Switch 



Short Circuit 


Any damage to a circuit is classified as a 
short circuit. 

There are three types of common failures that 
can occur in a circuit: 

• Open circuit - break in the path of current 
flow 

• Short to ground - circuit grounded before 
load 

• Short to power - circuit path is exposed to 
another source voltage

Basic Electricity 







Ohm’s Law 

The key to intelligent troubleshooting of electrical circuits is a thorough understanding 
of Ohm’s Law. Ohm’s Law states that the current flowing in a circuit varies directly with 
the voltage and inversely with the resistance. 

The pressure of one volt applied to one Ohm of resistance will cause one amp of 
current to flow. If the voltage increases, current will increase. If resistance increases, 
current will decrease. 

Knowing any two of the three factors (volts, resistance or current) enables the third 
factor to be calculated using Ohm’s Law. 

The mathematical expression is: 

Volts = Resistance X Current 


This formula is expressed in the Ohm’s Law Triangle. 
To find a missing factor, insert the known 


factors in the appropriate position and perform the math. A horizontal line between 
two factors means to divide, a vertical line means multiply. 



Ohm’s Law Triangle 


V = Volts 

I = Current or Amps (A) 

R = Resistance (W) 

Note: Voltage is sometimes expressed as U or E. 


Understanding of Ohm’s Law is essential in the diagnosis of electrical problems. A 
practical understanding of how the three factors affect each other is equally useful. 

• Source voltage is not affected by current or resistance. It can only have three states. 

Too low - Current flow will be low. 

Too high - Current flow will also be too high. 

Correct voltage - Current flow will be dependent on the resistance. 

• Current Flow will be directly affected by either voltage or resistance. 

High voltage or low resistance will cause an increase in current flow. 

Low voltage or high resistance will cause a decrease in current flow. 

• Resistance is not affected by either voltage or current. Resistance like source voltage 
can have only three states. 

Too low - current will be too high if the voltage is ok. 

Too high - current flow will be low if the voltage is ok. 

Correct resistance - current flow will be high or low, dependent on voltage.

Ohm’s Law - Series Circuits 

Applying Ohm’s Law in a series circuit requires simple math. The current has only one 
path. Circuit resistance total is arrived at by adding the individual resistances. Amperage 
is calculated by dividing source voltage by the total resistance. 



R 1 +R 2 = R t V / R t = A 


Key Features - Series Circuit 

• Current through each load is the same. 

• Total resistance equals the sum of the 
individual resistances. 

• Voltage drop across each load will be 
different if the resistance is different. 

• Total voltage drop equals source voltage. 


Example: 

If: R 1 =2Q 

R 2 = 3Q 
V =12.0 volts 
A = ? 

To calculate total resistance. 

Rf = R-j + R 2 
R t = 2 + 3 
R t = 5Q 

Now that the total resistance is known, we can 
calculate for the amperage. 

A = V/R t 

A = 12/5 

A =2.4 Amps (!) 



The total amperage can be used to calculate the expected voltage drop at each bulb? 
Ax R-j = voltage across bulb 1 A x R 2 = voltage across bulb 2 
2.4x2 = 4.8 volts 2.4x3 = 7.2 volts 


If the two voltage drops are added, the result should be source voltage. 

Voltage drop across bulb 1 + voltage drop across bulb 2 = source voltage 
4.8 v + 7.2 v= 12 v 


13 

Basic Electricity 






































Ohm’s Law Parallel Circuit - 2 Branches 

A Working in a Parallel circuit requires a little more math. Each branch of the circuit has 
it’s own path to the voltage source. Before amps are calculated total circuit resistance 
must be found. 



Parallel Circuit 

Example 1: 

If: R 1 =30 

R 2 = 6Q 

Voltage =12.0 volts 


Key Features - Parallel Circuit 

• Current flow through each branch can be 
different if the resistances are different. 

• Total Resistance of the circuit is less than 
the resistance of the lowest branch. 

• Voltage drop across each branch circuit is 
the same. 

• Total current is the sum of the branches. 


The current for both branch and R 2 can be calculated using Ohm’s Law. 

V/R'j = branch current V / R 2 - branch current 

12/3 = 4amps 12/6 = 2amps 

We can add the current flowing through each branch to determine the total amperage. 
Amperage of branch 1 + Amperage of branch 2 = Total circuit current 
4 a + 2 a = 6 amps 

We can also calculate for the total resistance of the circuit. 

Rf = (R'f x R 2 ) / (R-j + R 2 ) 

R t = (3 x 6)/(3 + 6) 

R t = 2Q 

Example 2: 

If: R*i = 6Q 

R 2 = 6Q 

To calculate the total resistance in an parallel circuit with resistances that are the same 
we could use the formula: 

Rf ~ ^(either )^ 

R t = 6/2 
R t = 3Q

Basic Electricity 






























Ohm’s Law Parallel Circuit - more than 2 Branches 

Calculating circuit resistance in a Parallel circuit with more than 2 branches is performed 
by one of two methods. All the key features for a Parallel circuit still apply.

Example: 1 

If: R-j=3Q 

R 2 = 3Q 
R 3 = 6 Q

Basic Electricity 





















































Example: 2 

If: R*i = 3Q 

R 2 = 3Q 
R 3 = 6 Q 
R 4 — 4Q 

To calculate the total resistance we can use the formula R\ Dr = (R^xR 2 ) I{R'l + R 2 ) 
to calculate the resistance of two branches at a time. 

F?br1 = ( R 1 x r 2) / ( r 1 + r 2) 

R br i=(3 x 3)1(3 + 3) 

Rbrl — 9/6 

R b ri = 1.5Q 

R b r2 ~ (Rbrl x ^3^ ^ brl + ^3^ 

R br 2 = ( 1 - 5 x 6 )/(1.5 + 6 ) 

R br 2 = 9/ 7.5 
R br2 — 1.2Q 

F?t = (Rbr 2 x ^ 4 ) ! (Rbr2 + ^ 4 ) 

R t = ( 1.2 x 4) 1 ( 1.2 + 4) 

R t = 4.8 / 5.2 

R t =.92Q 

Either formula you choose to utilize to calculate total resistance in a parallel circuit that 
has two or more branched will render the correct answer. 

Please note that the following rules are still applicable all for this parallel circuits: 

• Current flow through each branch can be different if the resistances are different. 

• Total Resistance of the circuit is less than the resistance of the lowest branch. 

• Voltage drop across each branch circuit is the same. 

• Total current is the sum of the branches.

Basic Electricity 



Ohm’s Law in Series-Parallel Circuit 

When calculating resistance in a series-parallel circuit, always calculate the equivalent 
resistance in the parallel portion of the circuit. Then add this resistance (equivalent resis¬ 
tance) to the resistance of the series portion of the circuit. 



Series Parallel Circuit 


Key Features - Series-Parallel Circuit 

• Current in the series portion of the circuit is 
the same at any point of that portion. 

• Total circuit resistance is the sum of the par¬ 
allel branch equivalent resistance and the 
series portion resistance. 

• Voltage applied to the parallel branch is 
source voltage minus any voltage drop across 
loads wired in series to the parallel branch in 
front of it in the circuit. 


Example: 1 

If: R 1 =4Q 

R 2 = 6Q 
R 3 = 2Q 



Calculate the equivalent resistance value of R1 and R2. 

Remember the resistance of a parallel circuit is lower than the lowest resistance in that 
circuit. The resistance of this portion of the circuit must be lower than 4Q, the lowest 
resistance. 

^parallel branch ~ 1 x ^2^ ^ (^1 + ^2^ 

^parallel branch ~ (4 X 6)1(4 + 6) 

^parallel branch ~ 2.4L2 


Now follow the rules of a Series circuit. 

The total circuit resistance is equal to the sum of the individual resistances. 

~ ^parallel branch + ^3 

Rf= 2.4Q + 2Q 
Rf= 4.4Q 


Alternate Formula for equivalent resistance: 

Find the current draw of each parallel branch, add 
together to get the total current draw of the paral¬ 
lel portion, then using ohms law find the resis¬ 
tance of the parallel branch.

Magnetic Theory 

The usefulness of electricity is greatly expanded through magnetism. Magnetism 
enables the existence of electric motors, generators, coils, relays, solenoids, transform¬ 
ers, etc. Magnetism, like electricity, can’t be seen, weighed on a scale or measured with 
a ruler. How it works and is put it to use can be understood. 

Two theories exist to explain how magnets work. The first theory states that a large guan- 
tity of small magnetized particles exist in a magnet. If the item is not magnetized the par¬ 
ticles are arranged in a random order. When the item becomes magnetized the particles 
align with each other. 

The second theory states that when the electrons of atoms are arranged in a certain 
order, the circles of force of each atom combine creating the magnetism.

Non Magnetized Iron Bar 


Magnetic Iron Bar 


Fundamentals of Magnetism 

• A magnet sets up a field of force. 

• Magnetic lines of force form closed loops that flow from North to South. 

• The space through which magnetic lines of force flow is called the magnetic field. 

• The magnetic field is strongest closer to the magnet and becomes weaker as it 
gets further away. 

• Magnetic lines of force never cross each other. 

• There is no known insulator against magnetism. 

• Magnetic lines pass more easily through iron and steel than air. 

• Opposing forces will occur at opposite ends of the magnet (Polarity). One end is the 
North Pole (+), the opposite end is the South Pole (-). 

• Like poles repel each other, unlike poles attract each other. 

• Some materials (wood, ceramics, and some metals) cannot be magnetized. 


22 

Basic Electricity 






There are two common types of magnets: 

• Permanent Magnets - made from materials such as hardened steel that become 
magnetic when subjected to an outside magnetizing force and remain magnetic 
even after the outside force has been removed. 

• Temporary Magnets - made from materials such as soft iron that remain magnetic 
only as long as an outside magnetic force is present. 


The lines of force of all magnets, either per¬ 
manent or temporary flow from the North 
Pole of the magnet to the South Pole. The 
magnetic lines of force or “flux” are stronger 
closer to the magnet and get weaker as the 
distance from the magnet increases. (Fig. 
19/1) 


Polarity refers to the opposing forces occur¬ 
ring at opposite ends of the magnet. All 
magnets have a North Pole and a South 
Pole. Like poles will repel each other and 
unlike poles will attract. (Fig.19/2) 


Most temporary magnetic fields are pro¬ 
duced by electricity flow. Whenever current 
flows through a conductor magnetic lines of 
force develop around the conductor. 

These lines of force form a circular pattern. 
The lines can be visualized as a magnetic 
cylinder extending the entire length of the 
conductor. (Fig. 19/3) 



Fig.19/1 




Fig.19/2 



Fig.19/3 


The lines of force have direction and change dependent on direction of current flow. 

The density of the lines of force are dependent on current flow through the conductor. 
The greater the current flow, the stronger the magnetic field that will be around the con¬ 
ductor. 


23 

Basic Electricity 













































Passing a current flow through a conductor will not generate a magnetic field strong 
enough to perform any work. 

If the conductor is coiled, the lines of force combine and become more dense forming a 
stronger field (Fig.20/1). 

The greater the number of turns of the conductor or the stronger the current flowing 
through the conductor the the stronger the magnetic field. 



Fig.20/1 


Inserting an iron core in the coiled conductor increases the magnetic field even more as 
iron makes a better path for the magnetic lines than air (Fig.20/2). 

This conductor wound around an iron bar is an “Electromagnet”. A coil with an air core is 
a “Solenoid”. 



Fig.20/2 

Electromagnetic Induction 

Producing a magnetic field by flowing current through a conductor is a process that can 
be reversed. A magnetic field can be set up that will cause current to flow in a conductor. 
This is called inducing or generating electricity by magnetism. 

To induce voltage in a conductor it is necessary to have relative motion between the con¬ 
ductor and the magnetic field. This motion can be in any one of three forms: 

• The conductor moves or rotates in a stationary magnetic field as in a DC Generator. 

• The magnetic field rotates in a stationary conductor producing voltage in the circuit 
as in an AC Generator or Alternator. 

• The building or collapsing of a magnetic field across a stationary conductor, as in an 
Ignition Coil. 


24 

Basic Electricity 





























Generating Voltage 


Generator 

In a generator, the conductor moves through 
a stationary magnetic field inducing voltage 
at the commutator, which connects to the 
circuit through brushes. 

The voltage induced is direct current. 




Commutator 


Alternator 

In an alternator the magnetic field moves 
(rotates) through the stationary conductor 
producing voltage in the circuit. 

The voltage induced is alternating current. 



Ignition Coil 

Voltage can be induced by the building or 
collapsing of a magnetic field across a 
stationary conductor. 

B+ power is supplied by the battery and a 
magnetic field is set up around the coiled 
conductor. The DME grounds or pulls low 
the current from the conductor and the loss 
of current causes the magnetic field to 
collapse inducing voltage in the secondary 
conductor.

Types of Voltage 


DC Voltage 

A flow of current that moves continuously in 
one direction from a point of high potential 
to a point of low potential is referred to as 
DC (Direct Current). 

Most automotive circuits operate on DC 
voltage as supplied by the battery(s). 


AC Voltage 

Current which reverses its direction at 
regular intervals is called AC (Alternating 
Current). 

This regular and continuous reversal of 
current flow (cycle) occurs many times per 
second. 

AC voltage as produced by an automotive 
alternator must be changed to direct current 
so that the battery can be charged.

Conductors, Insulators and Semi-Conductors 

Electrical properties of various materials are determined by the number of electrons in 
the outer ring of their atoms. 


Conductors 

Materials with 1 -3 electrons in the atoms 
outer ring make it easy for electrons to move 
from atom to atom. Remember that the def¬ 
inition of current flow is the movement of 
free electrons from one atom to another. 

The electrons in the outer ring of these con¬ 
ductors are loosely held and even a low 
EMF will cause the flow of free electrons. 

Many metals are good conductors, especial¬ 
ly gold, silver, copper, and aluminum. But 
not all conductors have the same amount of 
resistance to the flow of free electrons.

Insulators 

Materials with 5-8 electrons in their outer ring 
have those electrons bound tightly. These 
materials are insulators (Poor conductors). 

The electrons in the outer rings resist move¬ 
ment, the atoms don’t give up the electrons 
easily or accept free electrons easily. 

This effectively stops the flow of free electrons 
and thus any electrical current. 

Materials such as rubber, glass, and certain 
plastics are examples of good insulators. 

Semi-Conductors 

Materials with exactly 4 electrons in the atoms 
outer ring are neither conductors nor insulators. 

The 4 electrons in the outer ring cause special 
electrical properties which give them the name 
“Semi-Conductor”. 

Materials such as Germanium and Silicone are 
are two widely used semi-conductors. 



Insulator 



Semiconductor 


Semi-Conductor Doping 

When semi-conductors are in the form of a 
crystal, the four electrons of the outer ring are 
shared with a neighboring atom. 

This makes the crystal form of these materials 
an excellent insulator because there are no free 
electrons to carry a current flow. 



27 

Basic Electricity 












Other elements (Impurities) can be added to change the crystalline structure of the 
Germanium and Silicone. 


This is called Doping of the semi-conductors. Doping creates free electrons or holes 
enabling the semi-conductor to carry current. 


N-Type Material 

If the semi-conductor is doped with an element 
having 5 electrons in its outer ring there will not 
be enough space in the outer ring for the 9th 
electron (4 electrons in the semi-conductor and 
5 in the impurity). 

This type of doped material is called negative or 
N-material, because it already has excess elec¬ 
trons and will repel additional negative charges. 


Free Electrons 



N - Material 


P-Type Material 

If the semi-conductor is doped with an element 
having 3 electrons in its outer ring some of the 
atoms will only have 7 electrons in the outer 
ring. There will be a hole in some of the outer 
rings. 

This type of doped material is called positive or 
P-material because it will attract free electrons. 


Holes 



P-Material 


Junctions 

Doping Germanium and Silicone cause them to behave in unusual but predictable ways 
when exposed to voltage, depending on which charge of the voltage is connected to 
which type of material (P or N). 

The line along which joined P and N material meet is called the Junction. A simple 
component consisting of P-material and N-material joined at a junction is called a diode. 
The application of voltage to the two doped semiconductor materials is called biasing. 

A more complex material containing two PN junctions is called a Transistor. 


28 

Basic Electricity 




Diode —W- 

When N and P-type semiconductor materials are joined together to form a single crystal a 
Diode is created. The diode allows electron flow in one direction only. 

A diode has a forward bias when the Anode (P-material) is connected to B+ and the 
Cathode (N-material) is connected to B-. 

Reversing the source voltage on the diode will result in current flow stoppage. This is 
called reverse bias. 

Diodes are rated for specific voltage and current flow. The diode can not withstand 
unlimited forward bias and current flow. 


PN Junction

Anode 



Cathode 


Zener Diode —H- 

A diode which will allow a specified amount of reverse flow current is called a Zener 
Diode. If the breakdown voltage of the zener diode is 6 volts, at 6 volts and above the 
zener diode will allow reverse current flow with no damage to the diode. 

Below the breakdown voltage the zener diode will function as a normal diode and allow 
current flow in only one direction. 

Light Emitting Diode —$— 

Zener diodes are often used in charging systems to rectify or convert AC current to DC. 

Like the diode, zener diodes are rated for specific voltage, current and reverse current. 

Light-Emitting Diodes (LED) emit visible light when forward biased. As current flows 
through the diode, electrical energy is converted into visible light that is radiated through 
the thin positive material layer in the diode. 


29 

Basic Electricity 















Transistors 

The Transistor is a diode with some additional semiconductor material. The transistor 
contains two PN junctions, compared to one in a diode. 

Transistors can be constructed in two ways: the P section can be sandwiched between 
two N sections forming a NPN transistor, or the N section sandwiched between two P 
sections forming a PNP transistor. 

The three sections of the transistor are called the Emitter, the Base and the Collector. 


Current applied to the base will flow through the transistor. Current flows through the NPN 
in one direction and through the PNP in the opposite direction. 

Transistors are used to control current flow, act as a switch or as an amplifier to vary the 
current output dependent on base voltage variations. 

A transistor allows control of large currents with small current signals. 


Collector

Relays 

A Relay is a switch that uses electromagnetism to physically move the contacts. 

A small of amount of current flow through a relay coil moves an armature and opens or 
closes a set of points. 

The points control the flow of a larger amount of current through a separate circuit. 




30 

Basic Electricity 






















Think of the two sides of a relay independently. 

• Control side: Which includes the B+(KL86) and B-(KL85) for the coil that creates the 
magnetic force. If this side of the relay fails open the work side points will remain in 
their at rest position. 

• Work side: Which includes the B+ input power (KL30) and the Relay output (KL87). 
Failure of this side of the relay in the closed position (sticking points) will result in 
constant current flow. 

BMW uses relays with various numbers of pins (3,4,5 pin) and pin configurations (normal¬ 
ly open, normally closed and changeover type). Do not substitute relays. Always 
replace with the same type (e.g. DME Main Power Relay, Secondary Air Pump Relay 
and Rear Window Defroster Relay.). 


Solenoids 

A Solenoid, like a relay, uses current flow and 
electromagnetism to produce mechanical 
movement. Solenoids consist of a coil winding 
around a spring loaded metallic plunger. 

When current flows through the winding, the 
magnetic field attracts the movable plunger, 
pulling it against spring pressure into the center 
of the coil. When current flow stops, the mag¬ 
netic field collapses and the plunger is moved 
out of the coil by spring pressure. 

Solenoids are commonly used in starter 
motors, injectors and purge valves.

Starter Solenoid Circuit 


Switches —^ o — 

A Switch is a mechanical device used to start, stop or redirect current flow. A switch can 
be installed on the positive side of the circuit or the negative side of the circuit. A switch 
can be used to to control a load device directly or used to operate a relay which in turn 
can operate a higher current device, (e.g. Headlight switch, Horn button and Window 
switch.) 


Resistors 1=1 

Resistors limit the current flow in a circuit. The resistor is used in a circuit to introduce a 
desired amount of resistance into the circuit. 

Resistors are available in fixed resistance or variable resistance. Fixed resistors are color 
coded to indicate their resistance.

Variable Resistors 


Thermistor ^ z - 3 

The resistance of materials can vary with 
changes in temperature; therefore, resistors can 
have a changing resistance value dependent on 
temperature. 

A Thermistor is a resistor that can achieve large 
changes in resistance with small changes in 
temperature. 

Thermistors are normally of the NTC (negative 
temperature coefficient) type. As the tempera¬ 
ture increases the resistance decreases. Engine Temp Dual Thermistor

Potentiometer 1=1 

A Potentiometer (pot) is a variable resistor capa¬ 
ble of changing resistance values. 

Potentiometers have three terminals. One of 
the terminals is supply voltage, usually 5 volts. 
One of the terminals is the control module 
ground, and the third terminal is for the input 
signal into the control module. (Output from 
the Pot.) 

Potentiometers are used to measure mechani¬ 
cal movement, (e.g. EDR feedback) 



■ Rheostat v - 2 

A Rheostat is similar in operation to a potentiometer except a Rheostat only has two con¬ 
nectors. This arrangement allows the resistance to be varied between those two connec¬ 
tors. 


Electric Motors ® 

DC motors are similar to DC generators. They 
may be described as generators run backwards. 
When current is passed through the armature 
of a DC motor, a torque is generated by mag¬ 
netic reaction and the armature revolves. 



Stepper Motors 

Stepper Motors behave differently than standard DC motors. Unlike DC motors which 
spin freely when power is applied, stepper motors do as their name suggests, they step 
or rotate incrementally a little bit at a time. While DC motors need higher speeds to pro¬ 
duce higher torque, stepper motors provide their highest torque at their slowest speeds. 
Stepper motors also have holding torque, the ability to resist movement by outside forces. 


Steppers are driven by the interaction (attraction and repulsion) of magnetic fields. The 
driving magnetic field rotates as strategically placed coils are switched on and off. This 
pushes and pulls at permanent magnets arranged around the rotor that drive the output 
shaft.
