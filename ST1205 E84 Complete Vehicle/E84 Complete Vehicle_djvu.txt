1. Introduction 

1.1. General information 

The new BMW XI launched in August 2012 was the first Sports Activity Vehicle SAV in the premium 
compact class. The BMW XI follows the extremely successful tradition of the models BMW X5, BMW 
X3, and BMW X6. Their features and characteristics are available for the first time in a smaller vehicle 
class. 

The typical features of a BMW X-model combined with gracefully elongated proportions represents 
the distinct character within the family of BMW X-models. The striking front view underlines the robust 
and powerful appearance of the BMW XI by emphasizing the width.

2.2.1. Crash behavior 

The BMW XI features a stable passenger compartment that provides the occupants with the highest 
possible level of safety in the event of a collision. This good crash behavior is achieved in particular by 
using maximum strength steels in the pillar and node structures. 

In the event of head-on collisions, side member structures that fold in a specific manner ensure that 
the crash energy is dissipated as evenly as possible. In the event of a head-on collision with minimal 
overlap, specially designed cross member structures ensure that the acting forces are also transferred 
to the side of the vehicle opposite the impact. 

Part of designing these structural features was to optimally coordinate the restraint system with the 
vehicle. In addition to front airbags for the driver and front passenger, the BMW XI is equipped with a 
deformable steering column and belt tensioners with force limiters. 

There is only a very short crumple zone for side collisions. To achieve a low occupant load, partic¬ 
ular attention must be paid to the lowest possible penetration depth. A major contribution to this is 
made by the B-pillar designed from maximum strength sheet metal in combination with the doors that 
feature impact members which effectively reduce penetration of the doors into the interior. The side 
structure is achieved by optimally distributing the acting forces to the various load paths such as the 
A-pillar or the instrument panel cross member. 

The rear deformation area is formed by two support profiles running longitudinally, the luggage com¬ 
partment floor, the rear trim panel, the rear side panels integrated into the side frame and various rein¬ 
forcements. 


2.3. Exterior 


2.3.1. Front/rear system 

The front end meets the high requirements for pedestrian protection by providing corresponding de¬ 
formation spaces under the engine compartment lid as well as yielding hinge kinematics. 

The rear bumper comes standard with attachment points for two towing lugs or the fixture for a bicycle 
carrier available as an accessory. 

The difference between the front and rear bumpers as well as the sill trim in the basic version and the 
X-line package is the painted individual parts. The individual part in the rear bumper is larger than in 
the basic version, and two painted individual parts are added in the sill trim. The individual parts used 
in the bumpers of the basic version are not painted but are made from silver-color material.

The additional third brake light is accommodated in the rear spoiler. The washer jet is not integrated in 
the wiper as in the BMW 1 Series, but in the brake light, so that water is sprayed on the window from 
top to bottom. This results in an optimized cleaning function.

2.3.3. Doors 


The doors meet the more stringent side impact requirements in the USA. Additional side reinforce¬ 
ment, including in the front doors, prevents the doors from opening during impact. The rear doors are 
also equipped with an additional strut, which is already being used in other model series. 


A “crash pad” in the door trim panel in the form of integrated ribs reduces the occupant load in the 
chest area by moving the pelvis up early on. These measures are important for the 5* Euro NCAP rat¬ 
ing.

2.4.1. Front seats 

The BMW XI is offered with basic seats and sports seats. Both versions are also available with electri¬ 
cally adjustable functions. The side airbag is integrated in the front seats. What is new is that the stan¬ 
dard seat height adjustment in the basic version also allows the front passenger to optimally adjust the 
seat position. Widening the head restraints underscores the X-character of the seats. 

2.4.2. Rear seats 

The rear seat is designed for three people. The three-part, foldable rear seat backrest is separated at a 
ratio of 40:20:40. The right backrest part and the center backrest part can be folded down individually. 
The left backrest part is coupled with the center backrest part and cannot be folded separately. 

All backrest parts can be adjusted in eleven stages at angles between 1° and 31°. This makes it possi¬ 
ble to achieve a particularly comfortable seat position as well as provides a cargo position for the trans¬ 
port of larger objects. 

The center backrest can be folded down separately thus creating a large through-loading opening 
while at the same time permitting the outer seats to be used.

2.4.3. Panorama glass roof 

In comparison to a conventional slide/tilt sunroof, the panorama glass roof with its enlarged glass sur¬ 
face makes a positive contribution to the vehicle's interior appearance and sense of space. A two-sec¬ 
tion electrically movable sliding trim enlarges the glass portion. The electrically movable sliding trim 
and the resulting elimination of the handle recess have an additional positive effect on the appearance 
of the interior. The electrically movable sliding trim now appears as a homogenous area in the interior 
design.

3.3. Automatic transmission 


3.3.1. GA6HP19TU 

The 6HP19TU automatic transmission is installed in the xDrive35i in combination with the N55 engine 
The 6-speed automatic transmission 6HP19, clearly improved gearshift dynamics are achieved with 
this technical revision. In addition, a more stable regulation of the converter lockup clutch leads to im¬ 
proved shifting comfort, in particular at low temperatures. This contributes to consumption reduction. 

Note: Because the 6HP19TU automatic transmission is not designed to perform the MSA 
function the Auto Stop Start feature is not available on the xDrive35i. 


3.3.2. GA8HP45Z 

The GA8HP45Z is installed in both the sDrive28i and the xDrive28i in combination with the N20 en¬ 
gine. The transmission family GA8HP refers to the GA8HP45Z eight forward gears and one reverse 
gear. This transmission is built by ZF and its rated to 450 Nm of maximum torque 

The GA8HP45Z is a new development which gradually superseded the established GA6HP19ZTU 6- 
speed automatic transmissions. 

Highlights when compared to the GA6HP transmission: 

• Significantly enhanced spontaneity of the gears shifts 

• Greater driving and shifting comfort as a result of smaller gear jumps 

• Higher control precision of the converter lock-up clutch at low engine loads 

• High power transmission of the converter lock-up clutch 

• Reduced fuel consumption (-5 to -6%) 

• Equipped with a hydraulic pressure accumulator to perform the MSA function 

For more information regarding the GA8HP45Z automatic transmission refer to the ST1106 
F25 Complete Vehicle training material available on ICP and TIS. And for additional infor¬ 
mation regarding the MSA function refer to the ST1113 F30 Complete Vehicle “Powertrain” 
training material available on TIS and ICP. 

3.3.3. Automatic engine start-stop function 

With the market introduction of the E84 the automatic engine start-stop function MSA is installed as 
standard, with the exception of the BMW XI xDrive35i, as MSA is only available in all models with a 8- 
speed automatic gearbox (GA8HP). 


22 




E84 Complete Vehicle 

3. Powertrain 


Automatic transmission (GA8HP) 

The automatic engine start-stop function switches off the engine when the vehicle is brought to a 
standstill, the selector lever remains in the D position, and the driver presses the brake pedal to hold 
the vehicle at a standstill. This means that the car does not use any fuel when it is at a standstill. When 
the driver releases the brake pedal again, the engine is automatically restarted and the driver can con¬ 
tinue driving. 

Alternatively, the driver can move the selector lever from the "D" to the "P" position and release the 
brake pedal. The engine remains switched off. The engine is automatically started as soon as the driv¬ 
er moves the selector lever to the D position. 

The operating logic of the automatic engine start-stop function for vehicles with automatic transmis¬ 
sion is known from the F30. 


3.3.4. ECO PRO mode 

ECO PRO mode is standard equipment in all BMW XI models

The ECO PRO mode supports the driver in adopting a consumption-optimized driving style and re¬ 
duces fuel consumption through intelligent control of energy and A/C management. 


23 









E84 Complete Vehicle 

3. Powertrain 


Essentially the following measures help to reduce fuel consumption: 

• The driver is supported in adopting an optimized-consumption driving style by means of an 
alteration of the accelerator pedal characteristic and the shift program in automatic transmis¬ 
sions. 

• The heating and air-conditioning system (IHKA) is placed in ECO PRO mode. Here the A/ 

C system operates at reduced air drying and cooling. If the required temperature can be 
achieved without cold production, the A/C compressor is switched off. During heating mode 
the engine operating mode with increased heat dissipation is to the greatest possible extent 
dispensed with and the electric auxiliary heater is operated at lower power. 

• The driver is prompted by various displays to adopt an optimized-consumption driving style 
and is supported in optimizing their driving style. 

Depending on the driving style consumption savings of up to 15 % or an average of 8 % can be 
achieved by these measures. 

Upon activation of ECO PRO mode the automatic engine start-stop function MSA only used in the 
sDrive28i and xDrive28i is activated unless it has been manually deactivated beforehand.

3.4. Final drive 

The main goal during the development of the final drive for the BMW 1 Series and BMW 3 Series 
and now also for the BMW XI was a considerable improvement in efficiency that will lead to a corre¬ 
sponding consumption reduction in the vehicle. This lead to a new final drive generation called “L axle 
drive” (L = friction-optimized). 

3.4.1. Rear axle final drive 

For the first time, double helical ball bearings are used in the rear axle final drives, thus significantly re¬ 
ducing the operating temperature, which has a positive effect on function and service life. At the same 
time, oil flow losses are reduced considerably. The gearing was also adapted to the modified displace¬ 
ment behavior as well as optimized with regard to efficiency. 

In addition, the torque capacity of the rear axle final drives HAG168L and HAG188L was increased by 
10%. For acoustic reasons, the housing of the rear axle final drive is still designed as a spheroidal cast 
part. 

With regard to the improved consumption concept of the driving performance dynamics, a specifically 
developed rear axle final drive hypoid gear set is available for each engine/gearbox combination. During 
the design of the hypoid gear sets, particular attention was paid to achieving the vehicle acoustics ob¬ 
jectives. 

3.4.2. Front axle differential 

Reducing the power loss was also an important goal during the development of the front axle differ¬ 
entials, coupled with the specification to reduce fuel consumption and weight differences between 
rear wheel and four-wheel drive to a minimum. In order to be able to use common parts, identical angu¬ 
lar-contact ball bearings are used as in the rear axle final drive with the same positive result.

3.5. Output shafts, front axle 

The front output shafts transfer the torque to the front wheels. The movement of the assemblies (en¬ 
gine/ transmission, bearings, rear axle) along with the spring travel of the wheels and angle changes 
in the drivetrain must be balanced out during this process. The front output shafts in an xDrive vehi¬ 
cle must take up large deflection angles caused by the steering angle at the wheel hubs. The output 
shafts must also be capable of transferring the maximum torque applied to them. 


Up till now, output shaft journals with longitudinal splines have been used for the axle to wheel hub 
connection. This connection is made by machining spur gears on both the axle and the wheel hub 
mating surfaces. When these components are then torqued to specifications the result is comparable 
to the conventional spline method. This system (first introduced in the US with the F25 X3) simplifies 
the installation of the drivetrain at the assembly plant and reduces manufacturing costs.

In the sDrive28i with the standard rear wheel drive, a double-pivot spring strut front axle that is made 
of aluminium and fitted with trailing links. This design of the front axle is identical to that used in the 
BMW 1 Series and 3 Series. The aluminium material of trailing arms and swivel bearings (forged) re¬ 
duce the unsprung masses. The aluminium front axle support (forged from various individual parts) al¬ 
so reduces the front axle load and thus permits a more favorable weight distribution while at the same 
time providing optimum stiffness of the front end. The height adjustment of the BMW XI with respect 
to the BMW 3 Series Sport Wagon is implemented by a modification to the swivel bearing.

A five-link rear axle HA5 as known from the E8x and E9x is installed. This design features a particularly 
precise wheel control and offers excellent dynamic properties with regard to the following: 


• Directional stability 

• Load reversal behavior 

• Self-steering response 

• Lane change stability 

• Transition behavior from cornering to straight-running stability (steering) 

The HA5 in the BMW XI offers very good tire comfort due to a double-elastic mounts and a large sup¬ 
port base of the rear axle. Furthermore, the design principle of the HA5 does not require a lot of instal¬ 
lation space and has a low weight. 

The five-link rear axle is mainly derived from a twin control arm rear axle with the track rod located in 
the rear, whereby the upper and lower A-arms were replaced by two individual arms each. The advan¬ 
tage of this is that, regardless of the installation space situation, it is possible to freely specify the ef- 


35 














E84 Complete Vehicle 

4. Chassis 


fective virtual kinematics point. The result of this design coordination is elasto-kinematics properties 
that permit exact wheel control across significant spring travel, which is required for the desired driving 
properties. In addition, due to small lever arms, the rear axle barely reacts to interferences. 

The large support base for toe and camber on the wheel carrier side and the extremely torsionally rigid 
trailing arms, as well as the stiff rear axle support and the connection to the body by means of com¬ 
pression struts ensure highly precise wheel control. This is the prerequisite for agile overall coordina¬ 
tion of the BMW XI. The use of high-torque engines as well as the use of run flat tires were taken into 
consideration by the large rear axle support base; this concept is very important both for driving prop¬ 
erties as well as for good acoustic insulation. 

Many of the rear axle components of the BMW 3 Series Sport Wagon are being adopted for the BMW 
XI. Only the hub carrier and the upper wishbone were redesigned for the height adjustment necessary 
in the BMW XI. For the rear axle support, only the rear crossbridge with the connection for camber link 
and toe link had to be redesigned; the remaining components are identical to the rear axle support in 
the BMW 3 Series Sport Wagon. 

The HA5 provides the best prerequisites for the particularly space-saving rear concept (location of rear 
seat position, fuel tank, and luggage compartment). Thus, a comparably large through-loading width 
as well as ample leg room can be achieved in the rear. 

4.1.4. Steering systems 

Depending on the model and equipment, the following different steering systems are used in the 
BMW XI: 

• Electric power steering with the parallel arrangement of the electric motor (sDrive28i only) 
without Servotronic 

• Hydraulic steering with an 18.5 steering ratio 

• Servotronic (SA216), available only for hydraulic steering 

The EPS in the BMW XI makes a major contribution to the reduction of C0 2 emissions due to the de¬ 
mand-oriented control of the assisted torque. 

Electric power steering EPS is only offered in the sDrive28i rear wheel drive version. 

The xDrive models for all other markets are offered with the hydraulic steering system adopted from 
the E8x and E9x. 

Servotronic (SA216) is standard on the xDrive35i and available as an option on the xDrive28i. 


4.1.5. Brakes 

The BMW XI is equipped with floating calliper brakes. The top model xDrive28i is the only model that 
has a floating calliper brake in the frame construction at the front axle. All brake discs are ventilated.

4.1.7. Wheels 

The sDrive28i and xDrive28i are equipped with the ZRF Run-flat tires package as standard. The ZRF 
Run-flat tires package consists of tires with emergency running properties, 17 inch standard wheels 
and the Extended Hump 2+ EH2+ rims, as well as the Run Flat Indicator. 

The xDrive35i is standard equipped with 18 inch but 19 inch wheels are available as optional equip¬ 
ment. 

This ZRF Run-flat tires package consists of the following: 

• RSC tires with emergency running properties on an EH2+ rim 

• Tire pressure monitor 

• Elimination of spare wheel 

• Elimination of jack 


4.2. Driving stability control systems 

4.2.1. Dynamic Stability Control DSC 

The familiar DSC Bosch 8+ is used in the BMW XI. It has to be observed here in particular that the 
DSC control unit in a BMW XI with rear wheel drive is not identical to a DSC control unit from the 
BMW XI with xDrive. The coordination of the DSC/DTC mode varies in the two different engine ver¬ 
sions. 

The DSC sensor cluster is located below the left seat and consists of a longitudinal, transverse, and 
yaw rate sensor.

• X = System with raised control thresholds 

• O = Can be activated or deactivated. 

• Note: The table on the following page describes the acronyms. 

The purpose of the table is to illustrate the functions of the driving stability control systems. The func¬ 
tional capability with regard to DSC/DTC for the BMW XI xDrive was adopted from the BMW 3 Series 
xDrive and for the BMW XI sDrive from the BMW Z4 sDrive and expanded for both with the tilt stabi¬ 
lization logic system from the BMW X5 due to the higher position of the center of gravity. 

For the 6-cylinder models, the additional functions such as drive-off assistant, fading compensation, 
brake standby, and drying by applying brake are already available in the standard equipment. 

As with F25 the BMW XI xDrive models are also offered with the (optional) 2VG Performance Control 
function (dynamic brake intervention), refer to Section 4.2.3 for more information. The DSC 8+ with its 
pulse-width-modulated activation for the analogue separator and intake valves allows for an analogue 
valve characteristic, which permits sensitive pressure control. As a result, higher control comfort in all 
DSC functions as well as in the optional equipment Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) is achieved.

In comparison to the previous one (ATC 300), the new transfer case (ATC 350) features a spur gear 
unit which makes better use of the installation space. While previous transfer boxes used to have a 
"coding and service resistor", it has been eliminated in the new transfer boxes. The compensation of 
the production tolerances in the transfer case which was previously achieved by the coding resistor is 
now accomplished via an internal classification that can also be found on the type plate.

Function 

The actuator with the integrated control unit of the transfer case activates the multi-disc clutch in the 
transfer case. In the normal function, the target torque request by the VTG is received by the DSC via 
the interface. The DSC has the VTG software and converts the target torque request (0-1400 Nm) via 
a characteristic into target angle information on the control motor drive.

4.2.3. Performance Control 

The customer can order the "2VG performance control" optional equipment for the BMW XI as part 
of the ZMP M Sport Package (xDrive vehicles only). Already known from F25 X3, this DSC function 
for the xDrive in the BMW XI is a dynamic intervention function that can be neither switched on or off. 
The principle for enhancing the agility of the xDrive vehicle is similar to the Dynamic Performance Con¬ 
trol function in the BMW X6. Variable torque distribution on the rear axle is achieved here by the dy¬ 
namic performance control. During performance control, the inner cornering rear wheel is braked dur¬ 
ing sporty driving and the generated braking torque is at the same time compensated through an in¬ 
tervention in the engine load control system. This generates a driving torque that reduces the steering 
angle and the tendency of an xDrive vehicle to understeer. 


46 





E84 Complete Vehicle 

4. Chassis 


In order to avoid increased brake wear, the function is switched back in stages between speeds of 
60 Km/h (37 mph) and 120 km/h (75 mph) and at speeds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and higher this agility 
function is no longer used. 

Understeering 

In an understeering driving situation, xDrive shifts more drive torque to the rear axle as the understeer¬ 
ing tendency increases. This allows the front axle to build up more traction which reduces understeer¬ 
ing. 

At the same time the Performance Control (SA 2VG) ensures (through braking intervention at the 
inner rear cornering wheel and by increasing the drive torque of the engine) that the vehicle 
adopts a neutral drivability without slowing it down.

Oversteering 

In an oversteering driving situation, xDrive distributes the drive torque so that the load on the rear axle 
is reduced as much as possible. 

At the same time, the DSC ensures (through additional brake intervention at the outer rear wheel 
during cornering) that the vehicle is quickly stabilized and that neutral drivability is restored.

4.2.4. Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) 

The extension of the conventional speed control by a comfortable brake intervention known from the 
BMW 3 Series leads to an extended application range with the following new operation options: 

• With the help of an "electronically controlled brake actuation" ECBA interface to the DSC, the 
vehicle speed is reduced in a considerably more dynamic manner via a brake intervention 

• In the application range from 30 km/h (18 mph) to 250 km/h (155 mph), certain "hand throttle 
functions" are possible on the operating lever.

The vehicle circuit structure for the BMW XI is mainly based on the proven wiring harness concept of 
the E8x and E9x. 

The noteworthy features of the vehicle circuit structure are listed below: 

• The multi-section customer-specific wiring harness, multi-section wiring harness for cockpit 

• The use of fiber-optic in the MOST bus 

• The alternator line is installed on the underbody 

With the customer-specific wiring harness, it is still possible (in some markets) to retrofit additional 
functions such as a telephone. By avoiding unnecessary interfaces and the implementation of a cus¬ 
tomer-specific wiring harness, an optimal product is created with regard to quality and weight. 

5.1.3. Energy management 

The energy management of the BMW XI is divided into the following areas: 

• Power management (PM) 

• Terminal control 

• Special energy functions 

For a detailed description of energy management, refer to the product information for the E8x and E9x 
vehicles.

5.1.6. Display and operating concept 

The display and operating concept in the BMW XI corresponds for the most part to the operating con¬ 
cept of the BMW 1 Series. The principle of "fewer switches facilitates logical operation" is retained in 
the BMW XI. 

The E84 LCI is equipped as standard with a storage compartment in the center of the dashboard. For 
vehicles which have an optional navigation system, the Central Information Display (CID) is arranged 
with side chrome applications. The center console is flatter on the side facing the driver. 

Other new features in the area of the interior equipment are: 

• Electroplated trims for the gear selector switch and cup holder 

• Light switch with chrome wedge.

Central Information Display (CID) 

The Central Information Display (CID) is identical to the CID in the BMW 1 Series and 3 Series. As in all 
new BMW models, operation also takes place via the central operating element, the controller. 

For further information, refer to the Owner's Manual for the BMW XI vehicle. 

Heating and air conditioning unit 

The BMW XI comes standard with automatic 2-zone air conditioning system which is a further de¬ 
velopment of the heating and air conditioning unit installed in the BMW 1 Series and 3 Series. The air 
mass flow rate is increased due to fewer internal flow losses and the optimized fan wheel.

5.1.7. Driver assist systems 

Rearview camera 

The rearview camera system is installed in the tailgate to the right next to the tailgate lock and is 
sealed with a rubber seal towards the tailgate. 



Index 

Explanation

Rearview camera 


The rearview camera is activated automatically together with the Park Distance Control (PDC) by en¬ 
gaging the reverse gear or manually by operating the button in the driver assist systems controls. 

In the Central Information Display (CID), the wide angle color image of the surroundings directly behind 
the vehicle is shown. The graphic images show the pre-calculated space needed for parking and ma¬ 
neuvering relative to the current steering wheel position and assist the driver during parking. 

The color obstacle marks in the camera image help the driver (in addition to the PDC warning sound) 
to pay attention to the obstacles during parking and maneuvering. 

For further information, refer to the rearview camera in the BMW X5 E70 training material available on 
TIS and ICP 

Daytime driving lights 

The BMW XI is equipped with the typical BMW daytime driving lights that are integrated in the corona 
rings. The BMW XI therefore meets the daytime driving lights requirements in all markets. 

The daytime driving lights function is activated as standard when the vehicle is delivered and is imple¬ 
mented with an H8 bulb.

Adaptive headlights 

The adaptive headlights adjust their dynamics to the particular driving situation depending on the 
speed. On country roads at speeds from 60 to 100 km/h (37 to 62 mph), the headlights provide op¬ 
timum curve area illumination and directly follow the driving dynamics of the vehicle. At interstate 
speeds, the control reduces the dynamic portions again, since continuous guidance and direction of 
movement are required. 

For further information, refer to the product information for the adaptive headlights in the current BMW 
5 Series and in the BMW XI Owner's Manual. 

High beam assistant 

As with the E8x and E9x Series vehicles, the high beam assistant is activated via the stalk on the steer¬ 
ing column. 

For further information, refer to the product information for the high beam assistant in the BMW 5 Se¬ 
ries and in the BMW XI Owner's Manual.

The already illuminated brake lights are enhanced by the activation of an additional brake light (located 
on the tailgate “L” section) under heavy braking in the following conditions: 

• The speed at the beginning of the braking operation was above 50 km/h (31 mph) 

• The braking operation is supported by a continuous intervention of the brake system 
e. g. ABS control braking operation 

• The braking operation is supported by the brake assistance system. 


5.2. Entertainment and communication 


5.2.1. Infotainment 

Car Information Computer (CIC) 

The BMW XI is available with the Car Information Computer (CIC) as part of the ZTP Technology 
Package. 

The ZTP Technology Package: 

• Car Information Computer Professional. 

• Navigation system (609) 

• Voice-command (620) 

• BMW Assist with Bluetooth (639)

A detailed description of the main menu and the selection of the individual functions are outlined in the 
BMW XI Owner's Manual. 


Furthermore, you can find a detailed description of the system in the F01 Audio System training mate¬ 
rial available on TIS and ICR 


5.2.2. Entertainment 

Rod-free antenna system “WING” 

Due to the rear window layout “WING” patented by BMW, it is possible to omit the rod antenna. This 
layout was introduced for the first time in the BMW X3 (F25). The FM antennas are created from the 
semi-circular heating zone that follows the rear wiper. The medium wave antenna consists of the wing 
layout to the left in the direction of travel. Other services such as FBD are accommodated in the right 
wing. 

Due to the completely new arrangement into semi-circular heating conductors and the right and left 
“WINGS,” an adequately large area can be gained for the critical medium wave antenna. This layout 
can also ensure a good defrosting and view out the rear window even for small rear windows as in the 
BMW XI. At the same time, this arrangement produces a powerful medium wave antenna. 


The antenna amplifier is centrally located, whereby additional filters are installed for the integration of 
the medium wave antenna in the wing layout.

Speaker and amplifier 

The speakers and amplifiers in the BMW XI are identical to those in the BMW 1 Series. An electro-dy¬ 
namic planar speaker is used additionally as a central speaker in the instrument panel of the BMW XI, 
which is installed in the roofliner as in the BMW 3 Series Sport Wagon. 

The two bass speakers are positioned under the front seats, thus allowing an even bass sound in the 
entire vehicle. The required housing volume is achieved as in the BMW 1 Series by connecting the 
bass speakers to the side sills.

Audio systems 

The following three audio systems are offered: 


HiFi Sound System 

Eight speakers are used in the HiFi sound system. The two bass speakers that are considerably more 
powerful compared to a basic stereo system are the core element here. The goal of the HiFi sound 
system is to evenly distribute the sound to all seats. In the front doors, tweeters are added to the sys¬ 
tem. As a result, the tweeter range output is greatly improved. Due to the external HiFi amplifier, the 
bass speakers can be activated independently of the front mid-range speakers through two 40 W 
output stages. The activation and increased number of available filters allow significantly more linear 
equalizing than is possible with this system.

HiFi Sound System Professional Logic 7 

The Harman Kardon HiFi System Professional Logic 7 (SA 688) is further optimized compared to the 
standard system. The (11 speaker) HiFi system allows the output of surround information included in 
the stereo signal in 5.2 format while using surround algorithm Logic 7. With the planar speaker (cen-

ter speaker), the sound pattern can thus be centered in the middle of the instrument panel. The ex¬ 
perience is like sitting directly in front of an orchestra. The mid-range speakers and tweeters with alu¬ 
minium membranes that were further improved compared to the HiFi system provide a significantly 
more differentiated sound pattern. The influence of driving noise is compensated by speed-depen¬ 
dent equalizing in small stages in the low-frequency range.
