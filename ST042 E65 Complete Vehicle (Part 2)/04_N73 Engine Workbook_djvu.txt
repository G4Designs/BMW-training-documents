N73B60 Engine 

Purpose of the System 

The N73 engine is a complete new BMW development from the NG Series (New 
Generation) as a B60 (6 liter). The N73B60 will be used in the E66 as a 760Li (USA). 



The BMW 760Li will set new standards in terms of performance and driving dynamics in 
the 12-cylinder market segment as well as significantly reduce fuel consumption. 

For the first time at BMW, Valvetronic technology (combination of Bi-VANOS and variable 
intake valve lift) is supplemented by direct injection (Dl). 

In addition, the N73 cylinder heads use 4 valve technology. 

The combination of these cutting edge technologies provides low fuel consumption and 
maximum power output and torque, making the N73 the best engine in its class.

Intake Manifold 


The intake system is a complete component constructed of magnesium in a shell type 
design and has separate manifold chambers for each cylinder bank. 


1. Intake manifold pressure sensors 

2. Captured gaskets 

3. Pressure control valves for crankcase 
ventilation 

4. Throttle valves 



The individual parts of the intake system are bonded and bolted to each other, providing 
considerable weight reduction (separating the shell halves is not permitted). 

The entire intake system is protected against corrosion by a dip coating procedure. The 
fastening bolts of the add on parts are also coated and must be replaced in the event of 
damage, to prevent corrosion and pitting. 

All of the gaskets (2) are secured by retainers (captured) to provide ease of installation. The 
intake system is isolated from the engine by rubber elements on the fastening bolts. 

An intake manifold pressure sensor (1) is used for each cylinder bank. Recording the man¬ 
ifold differential pressure is necessary for the correct throttle position (synchronization) so 
that a manifold differential pressure of 50 mbar can be balanced on each bank. 

Both sides of the induction system are fitted with a pressure control valve (3) for crankcase 
ventilation which is distributed to both banks. 


Note: When replacing the spark plugs, it is necessary to remove the entire intake system to 
avoid damaging the spark plugs during installation. The spark plugs must be replaced 
every 100,000 miles in US vehicles.

Ancillary Components and Drive Belts - Removal 

Remove the following compo¬ 
nents: 

1. Water pump pulley 

2. 6 rib main drive belt 

3. Main drive belt tensioner 

4. Alternator 

5. Deflection pulley 

6. Power steering and dynamic drive pump 

7. A/C compressor drive belt tensioner 

8. Crankshaft pulley 

9. A/C compressor 

10. 4 rib A/C compressor drive belt 

To remove the drive belts: 

The tensioning pulley is pushed back using a 
Torx tool in the recess provided (1) and fixed in 
this position by inserting a locking pin as shown i 
( 2 ). 

The cooling module of the N73 includes an 
external engine oil cooler. The engine oil cooler 
is located in front of the engine coolant radiator 
above the A/C condenser. 

42 - 02-16 

The engine oil flows from the oil pump through a 
channel in the crankcase to a connection on the 
alternator support. The alternator support has 
an oil thermostat (arrow to the right). 

A wax element in the oil thermostat opens the 
supply flow to the engine oil cooler from an oil 
temperature of 100 °C to 130 °C. 

A partial amount of engine oil will permanently 
bypass the oil thermostat, even when it is fully 
open and flows uncooled through the engine. 

The engine oil cooler helps to keep the engine oil 
temperature below 150 °C.

Cylinder Heads 


The two N73 cylinder heads are a new development from BMW and have been adapted to 
the new direct injection system. The cylinder heads are equipped with Valvetronic valve 
gear and Bi-VANOS. The inlet camshaft and the Valvetronic eccentric shaft are jointly guid¬ 
ed by a bridge support. 

The ports for the high pressure fuel injectors are located on the intake side. The engine is 
equipped with a high pressure fuel pump for each cylinder head. Each cylinder head has 
a bucket-tappet drive on the exhaust camshaft for the high pressure fuel pump. 

The secondary air ducts for subsequent exhaust gas treatment are integrated in the cylin¬ 
der heads. The cylinder heads are cooled by the “cross-flow” principle. The cylinder heads 
are made from aluminum and are manufactured using gravity die-casting. 




Cylinder Head Gaskets 


DCS00654 


The cylinder head gasket is a triple layer steel gasket with rubber coating. This gasket ver¬ 
sion is already established in previous engines (N62). 

The cylinder head bolts for the N73 engine are Ml 0x160 necked-down “stretch” bolts. 

Note: These bolts should always be replaced when repairs are performed. 

The lower part of the timing chain housing is bolted to the cylinder head using two M8x45 
bolts (arrows above). 


10 

N73B60 Engine - Diagnosis 






Cylinder Head - Preparation for Removal 


• Rotate the engine and set up cylinder number 1 valve gear “timing” for 
cylinder head removal, remove the VANOS solenoids, front cover and Bi- 
VAN OS units as per the Repair Instructions. 



Valvetronic 

The Valvetronic system simultaneously varies the valve opening time and the intake valve 
opening lift between 0.3 mm and 9.85 mm, according to engine speed and load. This 
means that the air volume is controlled according to engine requirements. The valve gear 
is essentially the same as the N62 engine and has been adapted to the geometry of the 
N73 (with two more cylinders). 


1. Valvetronic motor * 

2. Intermediate shaft * 

3. Bridge support * 

4. Eccentric shaft 

5. Torque compensation spring * 

6. Intake camshaft 

7. Exhaust camshaft with “triple” cam 
lobe for high pressure pump * 


* Modifications have been made to 
these components making them 
different from the N62. 


Note: To remove the cylinder head, 
it is necessary to remove the vari¬ 
able valve gear and eccentric shaft 
in order to gain access to the cylin¬ 
der head bolts. 



11 

N73B60 Engine - Diagnosis 











The Valvetronic motor is rubber mounted at the rear (1 lower left) to isolate it from the cylin¬ 
der head cover. The Valvetronic motor is secured to the bridge support by the intermedi¬ 
ate flange and has a hexagon drive (2 lower left), which engages into the intermediate shaft 
(7 lower right). 


The intermediate shaft is mounted in the bridge support and is engaged by its spindle in 
the eccentric shaft teeth. This design provides ease of removal if the motor/gear fails.

N73B60 Engine - Diagnosis 






























Note: When reinstalling the tension ring and tensioning 
drive washer, the ring eyelet must engage with the pin: 

• On the drive washer (1) 

and 

• In the intermediate shaft (2) 


Test fit (insert) the Valvetronic motor hex shaft. 

If it does not insert easily, remove the drive washer and 
flip the tension ring over to reassemble. 



• Remove torque compensation spring and Valvetronic bridge support 
assembly as per the Repair Instructions (N62 section can be used). 

• Remove bank 1 - 6 cylinder head.

Fuel Injector Removal 

The fuel injector installed position and mounting pressure are maintained by 
a twin hold down fixture (one hold down fixture for every two fuel injectors). 



The twin hold down fixtures are bolted to the 
cylinder head with spring washers, the correct 
mounting pressure is ensured by the contact 
pressure of the spring washers. 

The high pressure fuel injectors are positioned on 
the intake side at a 30° angle to the cylinder head 
and reach directly into the combustion chamber 
between the two intake valves. 



• Remove the fuel rail and disconnect plug con¬ 
nections (1). 

• Remove bolts (3), nozzle holder (4), spring 
washers (2) and store exactly as removed for 
re-installation. 

• Install special tool #13 1 430 and 13 5 250 on 
injector nozzles and drive out by slide ham¬ 
mering.

Engine Block 


Oil Sump 


The oil sump consists of two parts. The upper section of the oil sump is made from cast 
aluminum and is sealed to the crankcase with a rubber-coated sheet steel gasket. This 
section of the oil sump has a cross shaped cut out oil filter element recess. The upper sec¬ 
tion of the oil sump is inter connected to the oil pump and is sealed with a sealing ring. The 
double panel (noise insulation) lower section of the oil sump is flanged to the upper section 
of the oil sump.

Oil Sump Components 



• Remove oil sump assembly and oil pump. 

Oil Filter 

The canister type oil filter (3) is located under the engine by the oil sump. The support for 
the oil filter is integrated in the rear oil pump cover. The oil filter housing (2 with o-ring) is 
threaded into the rear of the oil pump cover through an opening in the oil sump. 

A drain plug is integrated in the oil filter housing 
for draining the filter assembly before the hous¬ 
ing is removed (1 with o-ring). 

The filter element support dome contains an 
over pressure relief valve. If the filter element is 
blocked, this valve allows a bypass of unfiltered 
engine oil around the element to supply lubrica¬ 
tion to the engine. 




15 

N73B60 Engine - Diagnosis 





Oil Pump 


The oil pump is mounted at an angle to the crankshaft bearing cap and is driven by the 
crankshaft using a roller chain. The oil pump is a two-stage gear oil pump with two gear 
clusters. 

1. Mounting points 

2. Oil pump drive shaft 

3. Oil pressure from pump to engine 

4. Control valve (Pump Stage/Pressure 
Control) 

5. Oil pressure control tube from the 
engine to the control valve. 

6. Oil pickup strainer 

7. Pressure relief valve (over 15 Bar) 

8. Oil filter 


Pressure Control 

The oil pressure control valve in the oil pump has two functions: 

1. Deactivates stage two oil pump circuit above 2 bar. Stage two is only active in the 
lower speed range. This is to ensure that there is always sufficient oil pressure for 
the VANOS units even at high oil temperatures and low speeds. The oil pump power 
consumption is reduced by deactivating stage two. 

2. Monitoring the required oil pressure for the engine. The piston in the control valve is 
moved by a spring against the engine control pressure which is returning from the 
engine. This means that precise monitoring of the actual engine oil pressure is pos¬ 
sible. 

A separate pressure relief valve in the oil pump automatically opens at the maximum pres¬ 
sure of approximately 15 bar. This prevents damage in the oil pump especially at low oil 
temperatures. 


• Disassemble oil pump for visual inspection. 




Oil Pump

Crankshaft 


The N73 uses a forged steel 
crankshaft (1 - front). 

Each crankshaft throw has two 
counterweights for balancing the 
moving masses (12 counter¬ 
weights in total). 

The crankshaft is supported by 
seven main bearings, the seventh 
is the thrust bearing. 



Crankshaft 


Crankshaft Thrust Bearing 

The thrust bearing halves are multiple pieces that are assem¬ 
bled as one part for the the number seven main bearing at the 
rear of the engine. 

Piston and Connecting Rod 

The iron coated cast aluminum alloy pistons are “domed” with valve reliefs in the crowns 
(1). The recess (2) directs the combustible mixture directly under the spark plug and pre¬ 
vents the combustion chamber from being divided into two parts. 

Piston rings: 

• First piston ring groove = square ring 

• Second piston ring groove = taperface ring 

• Third piston ring groove = two-part oil control 
ring 

Note: Due to the shaping of the piston crown 
and the wrist pin offset, the pistons are cylinder 
bank specific (crown index arrow always points 
to the front of the engine). 

The forged steel connecting rod and cap is separated by the familiar “cracked” process. 
The large end is angled at 30° allowing sufficient articulation in a very compact space. The 
pistons are cooled by oil jets spraying under the exhaust side of the piston crown. 




17 

N73B60 Engine - Diagnosis 






• Remove piston/connecting rod assembly from any cylinder of the bank 
(caution - use care around the oil spray jet). 

• Remove crankshaft thrust bearing cap for visual inspection. 

• Measure the piston diameter. 



• Measure the cylinder bore that the piston was removed from. 


Questions (N62 section can be used) 

What is the piston diameter? 

What are the cylinder bore measurements? Fill in the chart: 





What is the piston installation clearance on a “used” piston? 

What is the permissible total wear tolerance between piston and cylinder? 

What is the permitted out-of-round of a cylinder bore? 

What is the permitted conicity (taper) of a cylinder bore? 

How are the pistons identified for the cylinder bank? 

What is the correct way to install connecting rods (on the pistons) for cylinder bank 1-6? 


18 

N73B60 Engine - Diagnosis 






Crankcase 


The crankcase is a one-piece “open deck” design and is made entirely from AluSil. In mass 
production, the cylinder bores are finished by an etching procedure. This involves etching 
out a thin aluminium layer from the cylinder walls. By doing this, the high strength silicon 
crystals are exposed. The silicon crystals form a high strength running surface for the pis¬ 
tons.

Coolant Circuit 

The coolant flow has been optimized allowing the engine to warm up as quickly as possi¬ 
ble after a cold start as well as even and sufficient engine cooling while the engine is run¬ 
ning. The cylinder heads are supplied with coolant in a cross-flow pattern. This ensures 
more even temperature distribution to all cylinders. 

The cooling system ventilation has been improved and is enhanced by using ventilation 
ports in the cylinder heads and in the radiator. The air in the cooling system accumulates 
in the reservoir/expansion tank. When a pressure of 2 bar is reached in the expansion tank, 
the air is bled out by the pressure relief valve in the reservoir cap. 

Note: The ventilation ports in the front of the cylinder heads provide quicker “self bleeding” 
during a routine coolant exchange. The complex cooling system and the small ventilation 
ports require that time should be allowed after the cooling system has been filled for the air 
to escape. 


Coolant flow in the Engine Block (similar to N62) 

The coolant flows from the water pump through the feed pipe in the engine's V and to the 
rear of the engine block. This area has a cast aluminum cover. From the rear of the engine, 
the coolant flows to the external cylinder walls and from there into the cylinder heads. 

The coolant then cross flows through the cylinder heads (exhaust to intake) into the engine 
block inner coolant jacket into the engine “V” and through the return connection to the ther¬ 
mostat housing. When the coolant is cold it flows from the thermostat (closed) directly into 
the water pump and back to the engine (recirculating for faster warm up). 

When the engine reaches operating temperature (85 °C-110 °C), the thermostat opens the 
entire cooling circuit to include the radiator. 


Notes: 


22 

N73B60 Engine - Diagnosis 



The coolant flows to the rear of the engine block, from there through the side channels to 
the cylinder walls and then into the cylinder heads (lower left picture). The cast aluminum 
cover at the rear of the engine block (with sealing bead) is shown on the lower right.
