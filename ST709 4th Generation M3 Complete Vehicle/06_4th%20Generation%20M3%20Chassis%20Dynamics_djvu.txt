Front Axle Carrier 


The front axle carrier is an aluminum alloy construction. In order to ensure optimum 
strength and torsional rigidity, a high-pressure forming technigue has been used to 
manufacture certain sections. 

Aluminum has been chosen for its lightweight and strength properties. The components 
of the front axle are joined together by an aluminum welding process.

Swivel Bearing 

The ’M’ swivel bearing is completely new. The bearing 
is made from an aluminum cast alloy, which reduces the 
weight by 500 grams. 

The following changes have been made to the front 
wheel carrier: 

• Adjusted dimensions for the larger 'M' wheel. 

• As described below, the method by which the 
spring strut is clamped into the swivel bearing 
has been changed. 

• The geometric fixing points for the wishbone, 
tension strut and steering track rod have been 
selected to ensure optimum sports vehicle kinematics. 

• Modified mounting position for the larger brake caliper.

Spring Strut 


The front steel suspension spring has a 95 mm compression and 100 mm rebound travel. 

A new spring concept supports lateral chassis stability. Depending on the vehicle weight 
(equipment), modified spring types are used.

As shown in the diagram, the clamp height has been increased on the Z-axis from 
52 mm on the series E92 (left) to 76 mm on the E92 M3 (right). 

The front spring strut now has an additional support. The wheel carrier has also been 
modified to compensate for the increased drive and dynamic forces. 

The lower contact face of the spring strut in the E92 M3 has a cone, which is positioned 
firmly in the wheel carrier. In the series E92, however, the front spring strut has a parallel 
construction and is only held in place by the clamping force. 

This design change and the increased clamp height accommodate the increased reac¬ 
tion forces of the spring strut and increase the overall stability of the wheel suspension. 

During assembly, the M3 spring strut is pulled into the lower cone using a new special 
tool. 

Note: Follow the new installation and removal process according to the service 
repair manual.

Tension Strut 

The tension strut is similar to that used in the series 
E92, but features an 'M'-specific harder rubber mount. 



Wishbone 

The M control arm is completely new and is connect¬ 
ed to the axle carrier and wheel carrier by two ball 
joints. It is manufactured out of forged aluminum alloy. 



Wheel Bearing Unit 

The M3 wheel bearing unit is identical to the E60 M5 
wheel bearing unit. It has three dowel pins for the 
brake disc. 



Front Anti-roll Bar 

The weight-optimized front anti-roll bar was adapted 
for the M3 and has a special rubber bearing material 
for more direct response. The hinged brackets are 
made out of an aluminum alloy (series E92 steel).

Steering 


The design of the rack-and-pinion steering system is the same as the series E92. The 
average variable overall ratio is 12.5 and hence sports-oriented (16 in the series E92). 

In the M3, the steering force support is controlled by the MSS60 via the Servotronic 
valve. A speed dependent characteristic curve is stored in the MSS60 for this purpose. 
With the MDrive menu option, a second and even more sports oriented characteristic 
curve can be activated (see the chapter on MDrive). 

The steering oil is guided through a steering oil cooler before it returns to the oil reser¬ 
voir. 


The E92 M3 is not available with active steering.

Rear Axle 


Rear Axle Carrier 

The rear axle carrier is constructed from steel sections which are welded together. All 
mounting points for the rear axle and suspension components are formed or attached to 
the axle carrier making it an integral component. 

Nearly all components of the rear chassis have been revised, the aim is to achieve opti¬ 
mum sports vehicle kinematics, chassis stability and a more precise and direct response, 
with a simultaneous reduction in weight. 

This has been achieved by the careful selection of materials for the axle components 
and bearings, and through a modification of the axle geometry.

Wheel Carrier 

The attachment points for toe, camber, wishbone, longitudinal and traction struts have 
been positioned specifically for the 'M' model. 

Its overall dimensions allow for the larger M wheel to be fitted. The ’M’ wheel carrier is 
fitted with a modified rubber mount connecting to the semi-trailing arm and a ball joint 
for the camber strut. 

Toe Struts 

The new ’M’ toe strut is forged from Aluminum. It is one-piece and has two integrated 
ball joints.

Camber Struts 

The M camber strut is a new lightweight component forged from Aluminum. Its design 
reduces the unsprung mass of the vehicle. 

Wishbone 

The new 'M' wishbone is forged from aluminum and has a modified integrated ball joint 
and a rubber mount. 

Control Strut 

The semi-trailing arm is the only rear suspension strut that is taken from the series E92. 

It is connected further inwards on the rear axle carrier, only the rubber mount is new. 

Traction Strut 

The geometry of the forged aluminum 'M' traction strut has been revised. It now has a 
new integrated rubber mount for the wheel carrier. The ball joint for the rear axle carrier 
has been taken from the series E92. 

Rear Shock Absorbers 

New M specific rear aluminum dampers are fitted to the M3. Electronic damper control - 
continuous (EDC-K), is available as an option. 

The integrated lower damper rubber mount has a support sleeve that improves the 
rigidity and stability between the damper and the camber strut.

Electronic Damper Control - Continuous (EDC-K) 



EDC-K is available for the first time in the E92 M3. EDC-K is an option and is based on 
the EDC-K in the E65. 

Both dampers of one axis are always activated in parallel. The valve is installed internally 
in the damper in the damper oil system. 

The driver can choose between three settings, the controlled programs "Comfort" and 
"Normal", or the uncontrolled fixed setting "Sport". 

The program is selected using the EDC-K button on the center console or preset via the 
MDrive menu and activated using the M button on the steering wheel (for more informa¬ 
tion, see the MDrive chapter). 

The input signals come from two vertical acceleration sensors in the front wheel arches 
and a third sensor in the rear right-hand wheel arch. 

The steering column switch cluster sends the steering angle to the F-CAN. This is trans¬ 
mitted together with the wheel speeds from the DSC to the PT-CAN and evaluated in the 
EDC-K control unit. 

The longitudinal, lateral and vertical accelerations calculated as a result are used as a 
basis for regulation. 

The EDC-K button signal enters the junction box and is transmitted to the EDC-K on the 
PT-CAN.

Wheels, Tires and Brakes 


Wheels and Tires 

In the standard version, the cast 18" 'M' double spoke wheel (style 260) is available for 
the E92 M3, with the forged and polished 19" 'M' double-spoke wheel (style 220) avail¬ 
able as an option. These are weight-optimized M3 light alloy wheels. 

The tires are also specifically selected for the M3. The Michelin Pilot Sport (PS2*) is 
currently fitted.

Brakes 

For the E92 M3, the M Compound brake system with 
perforated brake discs and three 'M'-typical brake pad 
wear sensors is used, with a specifically adapted operat¬ 
ing principle and dimensions.. The diameter of the brake 
discs has increased compared to the E46 M3 by 35 mm 
at the front, and by 22 mm at the rear. 



Brake System Specification 

Front brake: Diameter 360 mm, thickness 30 mm, direction-specific ventilation, single¬ 
piston floating caliper (lightweight metal alloy), brake pad wear sensor right 
and left. 

Rear brake: Diameter 350 mm, thickness 24 mm, direction-specific ventilation, internal 

handbrake with 185 mm diameter (similar to E60 M5), single-piston floating 
caliper (cast metal alloy), brake pad wear sensor on right. 

Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) MK60E5 

The E92 M3 is equipped with the MK60E5 DSC system made by Continental Teves, 
which has been specifically adapted to its driving dynamics. The "civilian" version is 
installed in several models including the 6-cylinder series E92 and an M-specific version 
is installed in the E6x M5 and M6. 

The fundamental difference in both versions is the replacement of Dynamic Traction 
Control (DTC) with M Dynamic Mode (MDM). MDM has been adapted to suit sports car 
dynamism for experienced sports drivers. The permitted float angle and longitudinal slip 
in good environmental conditions (road, weather, etc.) are also equally high. 

Furthermore, the driving-performance control (FLR), soft stop and Fading Brake Support 
(FBS) functions are not required in the 'M' version. 

The braking readiness, "apply the footbrake and the handbrake until the discs and drums 
are dry" and the gradient assistant functions have been adapted appropriately.
