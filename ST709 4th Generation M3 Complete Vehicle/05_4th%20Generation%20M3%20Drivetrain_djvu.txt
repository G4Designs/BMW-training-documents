Introduction 


Via the self-adjusting SAC double-disc clutch, the power flow from the S65B40 engine 
is forwarded to the 6-gear manual gearbox (GS6-53BZ). This gearbox is based on the 6- 
speed transmission used in the E60 M5. In contrast to this gearbox, however, the M3 
features electrically controlled transmission oil cooling. 

A further highlight of the M range is located behind the M3 drive shaft. 

This is the fully-variable limited slip differential transmission, which was first used in the 
E46 M3, and has now been adapted to the demands of the E92 M3. 

Appropriately adjusted output shafts ensure the distribution of power flow to the rear 
wheels.

GS6-53BZ Manual Transmission 

The following sensors are fitted on manual gearbox housings: 

• Zero gear sensor (selector gate) 

• Engine speed sensor, transmission input 

• Transmission oil temperature sensor. j , 



The signals of these sensors are monitored and evaluated by the MSS60. 

When reverse gear is engaged, the reversing light switch mounted on the gearbox 
issues an earth signal to the footwell module (FRM) to activate the reversing lights. 

The transmission oil pump is controlled by the MSS60 depending on the transmission 
oil temperature.

Gearbox oil pump

Screw oil filter 


The activation threshold for the pump is approximately 130°C and the deactivation 
threshold is approximately 110°C. 

Should the transmission oil temperature rise above approx. 145°C due to a fault, the tem¬ 
perature value is gradually reduced in accordance with the engine speed in increments of 
150-500 rpm, to a minimum of 5,000 rpm. 5,000 rpm is also the value in the event of a 
failure of the ATF temperature sensor. 

An electrical gear-oil pump is used to pump gear oil from the gearbox to the gearbox oil 
cooler. A screw oil filter is located below the oil pump. 

The transmission housing has been adapted for the oil cooler connection. The oil pump 
is mounted on the manual transmission housing. 

The gear oil is replaced and the screw oil filter is checked or cleaned during the running- 
in inspection, and later according to service specifications (estimated after every third 
engine oil change). 

Note: For fault symptoms with engine speed limitation, the gear oil temperature 
should also be considered as a possible cause.

Clutch 


It is the first time that a double drive plate clutch has been used on an M3. 

The clutch and the dual-mass flywheel are based on the E60 M5 and E63/E64 M6 
(manual gearbox), but their combined weight has been reduced by 4 kg. 

The contact plate and the transfer plate form a single unit with the integrated clutch 
driving plate. 

The following changes have been made: 

• The weight of the clutch and the dual-mass flywheel has been reduced. 

• The transfer plate is hollow cast and shaped, similar to an internally ventilated brake 
rotor/disc. This increases heat dissipation and hence the permissible thermal load 
of the clutch.

Note: The clutch and the dual-mass flywheel are permanently connected and 
are balanced as a single unit. They can only be replaced in a set.

Propeller Shaft and Output Shafts 


The flexible clutch of the front propeller shaft is taken from the E6x M5/M6. 

The front drive shaft is hollow and has a graduated cross section. 

The rear propeller shaft is also a tubular construction and has an equal cross section 
along its entire length. The thickness of the tubing and the geometry of the front and 
rear propeller shaft have been adapted to handle the increased driving power. Both 
propeller shafts are fitted with the same constant velocity joints that are used on 



E92 M3 Axle drive components (Front propeller shaft with flexible clutch & rear) 

Note: The center bearing can be mounted in two directions. It is important 
that the bearing is mounted with the word "TOP" facing the body. 

Both output shafts are hollow and have a graduated cross section. The external axle 
shaft joint is new. The internal axle shaft joint is based on the joint used in the E60 M5. 
The left and right output shafts are different in length.

Final Drive 


In principle, the final drive is assembled in the same way as in the E6x M5/M6. It is, 
however, a separate new development. 


The bevel gear shaft bearing is a friction optimized, double-row, angular-contact ball 
bearing. The gear ratio between the bevel gear and the crown gear has been adapted 
to the engine speed and gearbox ratio of the M3.

The final drive ratio is 3.85:1. 

The 215 gear set (crown wheel diameter 215 mm) has been temperature and noise 
optimized. A friction-reduced gearing is used. 

The housing of the final drive has been adapted to accommodate the double-row 
angular-contact ball bearing. The flanges for the propeller and drive shafts are the same 
as those used on the E6x M5 and M6. 



Note: Due to their function, the shafts of the right and left stub axles in the final 
drive have different lengths. In an idle state, this results in a noticeably 
different vertical clearance of both flanges, which is a feature of the 
design. This does not affect the function and is not a cause for complaint. 
This uneven clearance applies for all models with fully variable M slip 
differential and may affect either the right or the left flange, depending on 
the version and model.

Final drive end cover 

The transmission housing end cover has been modified to ensure optimum gear oil cool¬ 
ing and bevel gear lubrication. The end cover has more ribs, which improves heat 
exchange. 

The internal styling of the end cover is adapted according to the size of the differential 
and the final drive ratio. 

This M final drive also has three bearings, with two front bearing and one rear bearing. 

Fully Variable M Differential with Locking Action 

This unique limited slip differential design is based on the E46 M3 and the E6x M5/M6 
limited slip differential, where it is described in detail. 

The function of the limited slip differential has been adapted to ensure that the M3 
develops the best traction at different engine speeds and in every road situation.
