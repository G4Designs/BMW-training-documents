The new BMW M3 


A new addition to the ’M’ family has just arrived. The new BMW M3. A simple letter and 
number combination which has become synonymous with an extremely powerful and 
dynamic performance car. 

The M3 is now in its fourth generation with a history of success in the world of motor 
sport, winning races across the globe since its beginning back in 1985. Not only has the 
race version of the M3 gained a successful motor sports heritage, its on road credentials 
live up to the expectations and demands of today’s M3 drivers. The E92 M3 will be 
launched in the spring of 2008. 

This precisely balanced sports car will set new benchmarks in driving dynamics for sport 
coupes. As with its predecessor the focus has been on optimizing the power to weight 
ratio whilst maintaining the high engine speed concept. This combination ensures that 
both power and driving agility are exceptional, placing the M3 in an even higher level of 
sport car competition.

M3 Heritage 

E30 M3 





1988-1991 

From 1988, the first M3 generation turned the world of racing upside down. One year 
prior, the M3 had been launched as a thoroughbred sports car for the road. 

Powered by a four-cylinder four-valve engine, the original M3 showed its sporting ambi¬ 
tions in its exterior design: flared wheel arches and a large rear spoiler gave it lots of road 
presence.

2001 - 2006 

The third generation of the M3 enters the stage: with the M3 Coupe and the high-rewing 
naturally aspirated engine delivering 333 hp at up to 8,000 rpm, BMW once more intro¬ 
duced a true sports car, which, like its predecessor, was crowned “best handling car”.

M3 Concept 


Body 

In addition to the sporty and dynamic appearance in both the external design and the 
interior, the main features were weight optimization and a reinforced bodyshell for 
improved dynamic handling. A further outstanding feature of the E92 M3 is also 
once again the sophisticated aerodynamics typical of the M series. 

M- Specific Equipment 

Exterior: Front zone with generous air inlets, "Powerdome" engine hood with air inlet, 
carbon roof, side gills, outside mirrors, sill, wheel rim design, extended wheel 
arches, and the boot with spoiler and four exhaust tailpipes all combine to 
provide the initial impression. 

Interior: Sill trim strips, seats, steering wheel, instrument cluster, switches in the 
center console and the gear lever design all increase the anticipation. 

Engine 

Under the engine hood, the 8-cylinder power pack is the high-speed S65B40. 

With individual throttle butterflies, a generous intake air and exhaust manifold, and many 
more refined M-specific features such as the MSS60 engine control, the S65B40 is 
once again an outstanding highlight of the M series. 



10 

4th Generation M3 Introduction 









Drive 

Double-disc clutch, 6-gear manual transmission and the fully variable M limited-slip differ¬ 
ential ensure the forward momentum. 

Chassis and Suspension 

Front and rear axles with new suspension geometry and M-specific suspension settings 
with 18" tires. 

Specific objectives of the development were weight optimization, and in particular, control 
of the longitudinal and lateral acceleration/powerthat is generated when enjoying the 
pleasure of driving the M3. 

The M3 brake with compound brake discs, new high-performance brake pads and stan¬ 
dard M series ABS/DSC guarantee optimum braking efficiency and active safety. 

Electrical System 

The electrical eguipment and bus structure of the M3 are based on the E92. 

The optional MDrive menu can be used to preset/configure the standard Servotronic and 
the M engine dynamics control (enhanced with "Sport Plus"), the optional electronic 
damper control EDC-K (in the E9x series only available in the M3) and the DSC M 
dynamic mode. 


In the E9x series, the BMW Individual High End audio system is offered for the first time 
in the M3.

Engine and Technical Data 


V8 with High Engine Speed Concept 

It will be the first time that a V8 engine has been fitted in a series production M3. The 
main concept behind this high-rewing, high performance engine with a sporty sound is 
the extremely light, rigid and robust construction which is capable of reaching extreme 
engine speeds of up to 8,400 rpm. The engine achieves an impressive 400 hp (roughly 
100 hp per liter). 

The S65B40 is derived from its big brother, the S85B50. The main changes can be 
seen in the engine oil system, VANOS valve gear system and air intake system. Special 
consideration has also been given to engine weight optimization. 

The engine with all its assemblies is built in the special engine production area of the 
Munich BMW plant. 

One standard engine is used throughout the world and adapted to suit specific market 
reguirements. 



12 

4th Generation M3 Introduction 





A New Dimension 


The M engineers consider the high engine speed concept to be the most intelligent 
strategy of obtaining the maximum thrust from a vehicle. 

For example, in a modern formula 1 engine, the crankshaft works at up to 19,000 rpm 
(resulting in piston speeds of over 25 meters per second). 

The actual thrust at the driven wheels is the decisive factor for car acceleration. This 
thrust is achieved by the engine speed, the torgue and the short gear ratio. 

This concept has been adopted for vehicles in the M range from motor sport. The fully 
variable M limited-slip differential means that the thrust is optimally distributed to the live 
axle. 


Furthermore, the S65B40 also includes the established M-specific features such as dou¬ 
ble VANOS, individual throttle butterflies and high-performance engine electronics 
(MSS60 control unit).

Technical workarounds by increasing the cylinder capacity or boosting become excessive, 
thus avoiding the increased engine weight and consumption often associated with these 
methods. 

The high engine speed concept helps to achieve dynamically agile handling and the max¬ 
imum in sports driving performance characteristics. 

A maximum torgue of 400 Newton meters at 3,900 rpm is reached. Approx. 85 percent 
(340 Nm) can be utilized beyond the enormous engine speed range of 6,500 rpm. 

The S65B40 attains 8,400 rpm, and therefore a value that was previously only reserved 
for racing car engines or exotic custom vehicles. 

Note: For safety reasons, due to the engine dynamics when the vehicle is sta¬ 
tionary (i.e. without a road-speed signal), it is already down-controlled at 
7,000 rpm to prevent the engine speed from increasing into an impermis¬ 
sible range.

4th Generation M3 Introduction 






























The MDrive 


The MDrive menu known from the M5/M6 is also available in the M3 if equipped with 
the navigation system. 

Starting from the Drive main menu, the MDrive menu can be called up by pressing on 
the Drive controller and selecting M settings. 

The overall setting is called up/activated by pressing on the M button on the steering 
wheel. Pressing the M button again or restarting the vehicle deactivates the settings. 
The settings can, of course, be retrieved again using the M button. 

The following is a list of menu items with selection options that are currently available 
in the MDrive menu: 

• M Engine Dynamics Control (Power) 

- "Unchanged" 

- "Normal" 

- "Sport" 

- "Sport Plus" 

• DSC 

- "Unchanged" 

- "OFF" 

- "ON" 

- "M Dynamic mode" 

• Servotronic 

- "Normal" 

- "Sport" 

• EDC-K (only if fitted) 

- "Unchanged" 

- "Comfort" 

- "Normal" 

- "Sport" 


18 

4th Generation M3 Introduction 


By selecting "Unchanged", when the M button is pressed (i.e. the settings in the MDrive 
menu are called up), the current settings of this system are retained. 

Example: 

The driver has deactivated the Dynamic Stability Control function using the DSC button. 

- MDrive setting: M Engine dynamics control "Sport Plus"; DSC "Unchanged"; 
Servotronic "Sport". 

The driver presses the M button on the steering wheel to call up the M settings. 

- Only the "Sport Plus" and Servotronic "Sport" settings for M engine dynamics 
control are activated. DSC remains deactivated. 


19 

4th Generation M3 Introduction 


Menu Item Details 

M Engine Dynamics Control (Power) 

Apart from "Unchanged", three engine control programs are available; 

"Normal", "Sport" and "Sport Plus". 

The options determine how spontaneously the engine responds to actuation of the 
accelerator pedal. The maximum engine power is not changed. 

Using the power button in the center console, the driver can only choose between 
"Normal" and "Sport". 

"Sport Plus" is only available in the MDrive menu. 



DSC 

Apart from the "Unchanged" setting, in the DSC submenu, the options "OFF" "ON" and 
"M Dynamic mode" can be selected. 

If "M Dynamic Mode" is selected, the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) permits higher slip 
values at the wheels. The system does not activate the stabilizing function until very 
close to the handling limit range, when it influences engine output and/or actively 
engages the brakes. 

In "OFF" mode, an experienced sports car driver can also completely deactivate the DSC 
function. 

Using the DSC button in the center console, the driver can switch between "OFF" and 
"ON" or if "M Dynamic Mode" is active, between "M Dynamic Mode" and "OFF". 

"M Dynamic Mode" is only available in the MDrive menu. 


20 

4th Generation M3 Introduction 



EDC-K 

If option 223 continuous Electronic Damper Control is fitted together with MDrive, in 
addition to "Unchanged", three EDC programs can be selected in the MDrive menu: 
"Comfort", "Normal" and "Sport". 

The driver can use the EDC button in the center console to switch seguentially between 
the three programs. 

Servotronic 

The settings that can be selected for the Servotronic steering function are "Normal" and 
"Sport". Depending on the selection, the appropriate characteristic curve for power 
assisted steering is active. 

This selection option is only available in the MDrive menu. Without MDrive, the customer 
has no option, and a fixed programmed speed dependent characteristic curve is used. 

"Key-Dependent Settings" Menu 

Under "M settings", the "Key-dependent settings" menu is also available as well as the 
MDrive menu. 

This allows key-specific settings for certain MDrive menu items. 

M engine dynamics control and EDC settings are currently possible, which are assigned 
to the specific key used during the configuration (configuration => ZV closing action => 
memorizing). 

Under the M engine dynamics control menu item, "Normal" or "Sport" can be selected. 

In the EDC menu item, the options "Comfort", "Normal" or "Sport" can be selected.
