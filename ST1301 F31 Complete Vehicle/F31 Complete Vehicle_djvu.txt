F31 Complete Vehicle 

1. Introduction 


Following the introduction of the new compact sedan in the BMW 3-Series in February 2012 comes 
the fifth generation of the Sport Wagon, the F31, in early 2013. 

Each generation of these vehicles combined exceptional sporting character and dynamics, maximum 
comfort and innovation - each using the technology available at the time. 



u 


BMW F31 

The characteristic BMW proportions, the short overhang at the front, the long wheel base and the 
extended engine compartment lid transmit a dynamic image, even when the vehicle is stationary. 

The formidable efficiency of BMW engines is already known from the F30. The engines are 
characterized by high power and low consumption at the same time. 

Similar to the F30, different equipment packages are also offered in the F31, each with their own 
individual character.

Hot-formed steels (> 900 MPa) 

3 

Other steels (< 300 MPa) 


Multi-phase steels are steels where the structure consists of a number of phases. Higher-strength 
multi-phase steels with a yield strength R p o .2 of 300 to 600 MPa are, for example, dual-phase steels or 
TRIP steels. Super-strength multi-phase steels with a yield strength R p o .2 in excess of 600 MPa are, 
for example, complex-phase steels or martensitic-phase steels. 

Hot-formed manganese-boron steels are super-strength steels with a yield strength R p0 .2 in excess of 
900 MPa.

3. Tailgate 

3.1. Power tailgate 

For the first time in the BMW 3-Series a power tailgate is installed as standard. As is known from other 
BMW models, the tailgate is opened or closed by electric spindle drives in the water channel. 

Two hall effect sensors are installed in the spindle drives to detect the position of the tailgate. 

These are read out from the control unit for the power tailgate. 

The tailgate opens automatically when it is actuated by one of the following buttons: 

• Button for the remote control or ID transmitter 

• Button on the tailgate, outer 

• Button on the A-post 

In conjunction with the optional equipment Comfort Access (option 322) the tailgate can also be 
actuated hands-free by means of targeted foot movement. 

Using the iDrive controller, how far the tailgate should open can be set. 

The tailgate closes automatically if it is actuated via the button on the inside of the tailgate. 


3.1.1. Hands-free tailgate opening 

The hands-free tailgate opening is installed in vehicles with optional equipment Comfort Access 
(option 322). It is another operating element for the tailgate by the customer. Two sensors under the 
rear bumper detect the movement of the customers foot by making a simple kicking motion. The top 
sensor detects the shin while the bottom detects the toes.

A two-piece panorama glass roof is now standard equipment for the F31 in the US market. The larger 
area of glass gives the interior a light and roomy feel while providing the passengers with a sense of 
spaciousness. 

The panoramic glass roof is a slide / tilt sunroof that runs inwards, the same as that of the F25. The 
glass sunroof and the sliding head liner are fully electric and are operated by means of a switch on the 
roof function center (FZD). 

To exclude the risk of possible injury an anti-trap mechanism, for the glass sunroof and the sliding 
head liners, is active over the entire range of travel. The anti-trapping feature complies with all 
international legal requirements.

7. Automatic Start/Stop Function (MSA) 

The automatic start/stop function (MSA) comes standard in the F31. The operation is similar to current 
BMW models, but overall comfort of the function is improved. 

The following measures were taken to improve performance: 

• Immediately, before the engine automatically shuts down, the drivetrain is relieved of the 
alternator and air conditioning compressor loads thus reducing drive belt tension. Vibration is 
minimized and results in a smoother engine shutdown. 

• Noises during automatic engine starting are significantly reduced by earlier disengagement 
of the starter motor. The starter motor is now disengaged when a safe combustion process 
is reached instead of release at idle speed, as before. This is identified by the Digital Engine 
Electronics (DME) or Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE). 

• Consistent automatic start/stop functionality is improved by: 

elimination of the outside temperature threshold of 3 °C (37 °F) (switch-off inhibitor) 

decreasing the reactivation speed to 5 km/h (3 mph) (switch-off inhibitor) 

elimination of time restrictions of automatic engine stops for some selected switch-off 
inhibitors. 

If the automatic start/stop function for the engine is not available due to a switch-off inhibitor, this is 
displayed on the instrument cluster. The vehicle must be at a standstill for this. The display is delayed 
by one second. 

The following switch-off inhibitors are exceptions: 

• The engine is not running at idle speed 

• The steering wheel movement is not yet completed (steering wheel angle however < 90°) 

• The brake pedal is not pressed firmly enough 

An indicator also appears in the Central Information Display, when in the EfficientDynamics menu, with 
information on the relevant switch-off inhibitor. If the driver suppresses an automatic engine shutdown, 
the selector lever position is in drive position S/M, the display does not appear.

7.2. Automatic mode 

The automatic start/stop function is ready for operation following every engine start. 

The automatic start/stop function is activated at road speeds of > 5km/h (3 mph). 

The driver's absence is detected via the seat belt buckle switch and via the door contact. 

When the driver leaves the vehicle, the automatic start/stop function is deactivated to prevent the 
engine from starting automatically. 

The automatic start/stop function is always reactivated if: 

• the driver's seat belt is fastened and the vehicle is travelling at a speed of > 5 km/h (3 mph) 

• the driver's door is closed and the vehicle is travelling at a speed of > 5 km/h (3 mph). 

The prerequisites for deactivation of the automatic start/stop function vary depending on which 
switching mode the seat belt buckle switch and door contact are in when the automatic start/stop 
function is activated:

7. Automatic Start/Stop Function (MSA) 


Status during activation of automatic 
start/stop function 

Prerequisites for deactivation of automatic 
start/stop function 

• 

• 

The driver's seat belt is fastened 

The driver's door is closed 

The driver unfastens the seat belt buckle and opens 
the driver's door 

• 

• 

The driver's seat belt is not 
fastened 

The driver's door is closed 

The driver opens the driver's door 

• 

• 

The driver's seat belt is fastened 

The driver's door is opened 

The driver unfastens the seat belt buckle 


The automatic start/stop function is reactivated if: 

• the seat belt buckle is fastened and/or the driver's door is closed and the engine is started 

• the seat belt buckle is fastened and/or the driver's door is closed and the vehicle is travelling at 
a speed of > 5 km/h (3 mph). 


7.3. Switch-off inhibitor, switch-on requests, deactivators 

7.3.1. Switch-off inhibitors 

Under certain conditions, it is necessary to suppress the automatic start/stop function if: 

• the brake pedal is not pressed firmly enough which means the vehicle is detected as not being 
held sufficiently 

• the vehicle stops on uphill/downhill gradients > 12% 

• the steering angle is > 6° 

• the steering wheel movement is not yet complete (as otherwise sufficient support would not 
be provided by the power steering as a consequence) 

• the vehicle was not driven at a speed of > 5 km/h (3 mph) following the previous engine 
shutdown 

• the engine is not running at idle speed (accelerator pedal is being pressed) 

• the vehicle is reversing 

• the operating temperature of the engine is too low 

• the active carbon filter is being flushed (gasoline engines only) 

• the diesel particulate filter is being regenerated 

• the fuel grade is insufficient 

• the transmission adaptation is active 

• the hydraulic impulse storage is not yet charged (holds hydraulic pressure in transmission) 

• Stop-and-go traffic 


21 







F31 Complete Vehicle 

7. Automatic Start/Stop Function (MSA) 

• the state of charge is too low 

• the ambient temperature is above +30°C (86 °F) (with heating and air conditioning system 
switched on) 

• the condensation sensor of the IHKA detects fogging of the windshield 

• the heating and air conditioning system is switched on but the passenger compartment has 
not yet heated up or cooled down to the required temperature 

• ABS braking has been applied. 

7.3.2. Switch-on requests 

Conversely, it may also be necessary to start the engine if: 

• the vehicle is not sufficiently held by the released brake pedal 

• the steering wheel is moved 

• the accelerator pedal is actuated 

• the transmission switches from "P" to "D"; the driver previously shifted from position "D" to 
"P" when the engine was automatically shut down so he could take his foot off the brake pedal 

• the transmission changes from "D" to "N" or "R" 

• the state of charge is too low 

• the ambient temperature is above +30°C (86 °F) (with heating and air conditioning system 
switched on) 

• the condensation sensor of the IHKA detects fogging of the windshield 

• the evaporator temperature is too low to ensure sufficient climate control 

• Special case: the driver's seat belt is still fastened, the driver's door is opened and the brake 
pedal is released 

• the vehicle rolls (vehicle speed > 5 km/h (3 mph). 

Different input variables are used, for example: 

• ambient pressure (by ambient pressure sensor) 

• engine speed (by crankshaft sensor) 

• force and displacement in the tandem brake master cylinder, determined from brake pressure 
in the front axle brake circuit (pressure sensor in the DSC).

If a deactivation condition exists, the automatic start/stop function is deactivated. 

The following scenarios arise, depending on when the deactivation condition for the automatic start/ 
stop function occurred: 


22 




F31 Complete Vehicle 

7. Automatic Start/Stop Function (MSA) 

• the engine continues running and is no longer stopped automatically 

• the engine was stopped automatically and starts once again automatically 

• the engine was stopped automatically and no longer starts automatically (the Check Control 
message "MSA off" appears - the start/stop button must be operated in order to the start the 
engine). 

The following deactivators may occur: 

• the driver's absence has been detected 

• the engine did not start when the ignition was switched on 

• the engine compartment lid is unlocked 

• a fault related to the automatic start/stop function has been detected at the engine, 
transmission or components involved in the automatic start/stop function 

• the bus communication is faulty 

• the automatic start/stop function has been deactivated via the automatic 
start/stop button 

• the automatic start/stop function was deactivated via the diagnosis system 

• the vehicle is in transport mode 

• the engine was switched off on account of insufficient engine speed 

The individual statuses can be read out using the diagnosis system. 

An easy-to-follow example of a deactivation with subsequent switch-on request: 

• the automatic start/stop function is deactivated via the automatic start/stop button in the 
automatic engine shutdown phase, 

• as a consequence, the engine starts automatically, 

• after this, no further automatic engine shutdowns occur, the automatic start/stop 
function remains deactivated. 

7.4. Information for service 

7.4.1. Protection against automatic engine start 

A 

Observe the safety precautions when carrying out work on vehicles equipped with the automatic 
start/stop function! 


The engine is prevented from starting automatically when work is being carried out in the engine 
compartment. The automatic start/stop function is deactivated as soon as the engine 
compartment lid is opened. 

The engine can be restarted via the start/stop button. 


23 





F31 Complete Vehicle 

7. Automatic Start/Stop Function (MSA) 

The automatic start/stop function is reactivated if: 

• the engine compartment lid is closed and the engine is restarted 

• the engine compartment lid is closed and the vehicle is travelling at a 
speed of > 5 km/h (3 mph). 


7.4.2. Automatic start/stop function checklist for acceptance by the customer 

In the event of customer complaints, check these against the "Automatic Start/Stop function 
checklist". 

Process any fault entries using the diagnosis system. If no fault entries exist, check the condition of the 
automatic start/stop function with the automatic start/stop function system check. 

The automatic start/stop function system check service function shows an overview of the most recent 

automatic start/stop function status and provides further assistance with 

troubleshooting. 

Customer complaint: Frequently no engine shutdown - the engine repeatedly does not stop in 
situations where it should shut down automatically. 

Check the general automatic engine shutdown criteria in dialogue with the customer: 



Yes 

No 

Driver's seat belt fastened? 

□ 

□ 

Vehicle at standstill? 

□ 

□ 

Automatic transmission in position "D", brake pedal pressed? 

□ 

□ 

Engine at operating temperature? 

□ 

□ 

Vehicle not driven backwards before stopping? 

□ 

□

□ 

□ 

State of battery charge OK (no long immobilization periods or excessive short- 
distance driving)? 

□ 

□ 

Quality level of battery OK (no external charging procedure, no other devices 
connected to the battery)? 

□ 

□ 


If all criteria have been answered with Yes: 

• Implement automatic start/stop function system check service function 
If at least one criterion has been answered with No: 

• Automatic start/stop function is in working order

• Implement automatic start/stop function system check service function 


If at least one criterion has been answered with Yes: 

• Automatic start/stop function is in working order 

Customer complaint: Sudden automatic engine start - the engine unexpectedly starts 
automatically although no automatic engine start was expected. 

Check whether the engine has been automatically started by the automatic function for safety or 
comfort reasons. Explain the automatic functions to the customer: 



Yes 

No

• Implement automatic start/stop function system check service function 


If at least one criterion has been answered with Yes: 

• Automatic start/stop function is in working order 


25 











F31 Complete Vehicle 

7. Automatic Start/Stop Function (MSA) 

Customer complaint: Engine not starting - the brake pedal was released but the engine did 
not start automatically. 



Yes 

No 

Driver's door opened and seat belt buckle unfastened during the engine stop 
phase? 

□ 

□

7.4.3. Automatic deactivation of terminal 15 

Terminal 15 is switched off automatically via the door contact when the driver's door is opened and 
closed with the engine switched off. 

Terminal 15 can be switched back on permanently by subsequently pressing the start/stop button. 


7.4.4. Power management and battery replacement 

The automatic start/stop function and power management are strongly intertwined. 

The data on battery type and state of charge could get lost after: 

• Programming of the engine control 

• Replacement of the intelligent battery sensor 

• Disconnection of the battery 

• Battery replacement 

This data will only be available again once a standby current measurement has been carried out 
internally in the vehicle and after it has gone to sleep and has been locked. This measurement takes 
around 6 hours during which the vehicle must not be woken up. The automatic start/stop function will 
remain inactive until the data is transferred. 

In order for the vehicle to register the battery data after the battery has been replaced, the internal 
standby current must be measured. 

If the battery is replaced, an AGM battery must be reinstalled to ensure the automatic start/stop 
function remains in proper working order.
