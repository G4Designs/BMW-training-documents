S63TU Engine 
1. Introduction 


The S63 top (S63TU) engine is installed in the new BMW M5 and M6. It is a further development of 
the S63 engine from the BMW X5 M and BMW X6 M. The S63 top (S63TU) engine in the BMW M5/ 
M6 is the successor to the extremely successful S85 engine. With this "downsizing" this now be¬ 
comes a part of the BMW drive strategy of EfficientDynamics for M vehicles. The further development 
of the S63 top (S63TU) engine to the previous S63 engine is the latest fuel-mixture generation tech¬ 
nology Turbo-Valvetronic Direct Injection (TVDI). There are strong similarities here to the N20 and 
N55 engines. The aim in the development of the S63 top (S63TU) engine was not to achieve a power 
greater than that of the S63 engine, but to increase the response and rev characteristics, while at the 
same time reducing the fuel consumption. 

In this documentation the differences to the S63 engine are described.

New development 


In the engine designation S63B44T0 the T stands for “Top performance class” thus some material 
may refer to this engine as the S63 top and it also may be referred to as S63TU (in marketing terms). 

This document contains the short form of the engine designation S63 top (S63TU), which only indi¬ 
cates the engine type. 

1.4.2. Engine identification 

The engines have an identification mark on the crankcase to ensure proper identification and classifi¬ 
cation. The first six positions of the engine identification correspond to the engine designation. 

The engine number can be found on the engine above the engine identification. This consecutive 
number, in conjunction with the engine identification, allows proper identification of each individual en¬ 
gine.

2.1.1. Crankcase 

The crankcase is manufactured from die-cast aluminium GL-AISi917Cu4MG, similar to the S63 en¬ 
gine. The cylinder walls are made from Alusil. The crankcase was optimized for the specific M require¬ 
ments. 


2.1.2. Cylinder head gasket 

A three-layer spring steel gasket is used for the cylinder head gasket. There is a stopper plate (2) in the 
area of the cylinder bores in order to achieve sufficient contact pressure for sealing. The contact sur¬ 
faces for the cylinder head and the engine block are layered and have a partial fluorocaoutchouc coat¬ 
ing with anti-stick coating.

2.1.3. Cylinder head 

The cylinder head of the S63 top (S63TU) engine is a new development with integrated air ducts for 
the crankcase ventilation. 

3rd generation Valvetronic is also used in the S63 top (S63TU) engine, similar to the N55 engine. The 
Valvetronic servomotor is connected on the outside of the cylinder head.

2.1.4. Cylinder head cover 

Design 

The cylinder head cover is a new design with integrated crankcase ventilation and line routing. The 
operating principle of the crankcase ventilation is from the N63 engine. An separate line from the 
crankcase ventilation system to the air intake system is not used on the S63 top (S63TU) engine. Sep¬ 
arate bore holes for the individual intake ports are integrated in the cylinder head. Every bank has its 
own crankcase ventilation ducts. 

The camshaft sensors are positioned on the front of the cylinder head cover. 

To separate the oil in the blow-by gasses, a labyrinth oil separator is used. A pre-separator (5) and a 
impact plate with small air vents (4) are in the flow direction. The oil drops are separated at these bar¬ 
riers and return to the cylinder head via the return line (7+8). An impact surface (3) with an upstream 
filter ensures further separation of oil particles. The oil return (8) is equipped with a non-return valve 
in order to prevent direct intake of blow-by gasses without separation. If the oil level increases in this 
pipe, the non-return valve opens the oil drops into the cylinder head. Finally the cleaned blow-by gas¬ 
es are re-fed into the intake system depending on the operating condition of the engine via the non-re¬ 
turn valve (1) or via the volume control valve (10).

Crankcase ventilation in naturally aspirated engine operation 

In the naturally aspirated engine operation there is a vacuum in the air intake system (2). The volume 
control valve (15) is opened and the cleaned blow-by gases make their way to the intake ports via bore 
holes in the cylinder head and into the air intake system. As there is a risk that oil may be drawn in by 
the crankcase ventilation in the case of an increase of vacuum, the volume control valve (15) has a 
throttle function which limits the blow-by gas flow along with the pressure level in the crankcase. 

The vacuum in the crankcase ventilation keeps the non-return valve (12) closed. Additional fresh 
air flows into the oil separator via an overlying leak hole (13). This does not allow the vacuum in the 
crankcase to go above a maximum of 100 mbar.

Crankcase ventilation in boost mode 

In boost mode the pressure in the air intake system (2) increases and closes the volume control valve 
(15). Since there is a vacuum in the clean air pipe (10), the non-return valve (12) for the clean air pipe 
opens and the cleaned blow-by gases are directed to the compressor side of the exhaust turbocharger 
through the charge air cooler and into the air intake system.

2.1.5. Oil pan 

The oil pan is made from aluminium. Like the S63 engine, it is made up of two parts. The oil filter is in¬ 
tegrated in the upper oil pan section. 

The oil pump is bolted to the upper oil pan section and driven by a chain by the crankshaft. To avoid 
engine oil foaming, the drive chain and the shaft sprocket are separated from the oil by the oil pan. The 
oil deflector is integrated in the upper oil pan section. The oil drain plug is not used in the oil filter cover.

Crankshaft 

The crankshaft of the S63 top (S63TU) engine has a stroke of 88.3 mm and is forged steel (C38) with a 
hardened surface layer and 6 balance weights. 



S63 top (S63TU) crankshaft 

Crankshaft bearings 

The crankshaft is supported by five bearings. The two-material thrust bearing is located in the middle 
at the third bearing position. Lead-free three-material bearings are used.

The identification markings for the bearings are stamped on the crankcase and on the crankshaft. Re¬ 
fer to the repair instructions if the crankshaft is to be fitted with new bearings. 


2.2.2. Connecting rod with bearing 

Connecting rod 

The connecting rod of the S63 top (S63TU) engine has been redesigned. It is a cracked and forged 
connecting rod with a trapezoidal design. In the small end of the connecting rod with a formed hole is 
used like in the N20 and N55 engine. The force is evenly distributed over a larger area and the load on 
the edges of the rod bushings is reduced considerably.

Bearings 

Lead-free connecting rod bearing shells are used. A bearing pair with the colors red/blue are used as 
standard. The blue bearing is on the rod side, the red bearing on the cap side. 

2.2.3. Piston with piston rings 

Mahle cast pistons are used. The piston crown shape is adapted accordingly to the combustion pro¬ 
cesses, the valve reliefs in the piston crown and the use of the injectors with multiple nozzles.

2.4.1. Design 

In the S63 top (S63TU) engine the fully variable valve lift control (VVT) is now used in addition to dou¬ 
ble VANOS. The valvetrain itself comprises of already known components. A roller-type chain is used 
per bank for the drive of the camshafts. The chain tensioner and slide rails are common parts for both 
banks. The oil spray nozzles are integrated in the chain tensioner. For servicing the cams or any part of 
the valvetrain, the S63 top (S63TU) engine is not pinned at TDC of the cylinder, but at 150° before fir¬ 
ing TDC of cylinder #1. For locking the engine in this position a special tool is positioned on the tor¬ 
sional vibration damper, which is used as a reference for the alignment pin for the crankcase.

Intake and exhaust valves 

The inlet and exhaust valves both have a stem diameter of 6 mm. The exhaust valves are hollow and 
filled with sodium. This results in improved and quicker heat dissipation. 

2.4.2. Valvetronic 

A_ _ 

The Valvetronic is fully variable valve lift control and variable camshaft control (double VANOS), which 
makes the closing time of the intake valves adjustable. 

Valve lift control is performed on the intake side, while camshaft control is performed on both the in¬ 
take and exhaust sides. 

Throttle-free load control is only possible if: 

• the lift of the intake valve 

• and camshaft adjustment of the intake and exhaust camshafts are variably controllable. 


Result: 

The opening and closing times and the opening period and the lift of the intake valve are adjustable. 


VANOS 

The VANOS (variable camshaft timing control) components of taken from the N55 engine. The differ¬ 
ences between the S63 and S63TU engine are: 

• The adjustment range of the variable camshaft timing control (VANOS) was increased from 
50° to 70° through the use of four instead of five flanks. 

• The weight was reduced from 1050 g to 650 g (2.31 lbs to 1.43 lbs) through the use of alu¬ 
minium instead of steel.

2.5. Belt drive 

The belt drive does not have any major changes, only the drive belt and the belt pulley on the 
crankshaft have a smaller diameter due to the higher engine speed. 

The belt drive includes a main belt drive with an alternator, coolant pump and power steering pump. 
The main belt drive uses a mechanical tensioning pulley. 

The secondary belt drive includes the air conditioning compressor and is equipped with an elastic belt. 
The crankshaft pulley tensioning system from the S63 engine is used for replacing the elastic belt.

3. Oil Supply 

Extremely high deceleration values can occur while braking with the M5/M6 . This can push the engine 
oil to the front area of the oil pan. 

In this case, the pendulum slide cell pump can no longer guarantee the oil supply of the engine due to 
no oil available at the inlet side of the pump. 

For this reason an oil pump with an intake and pressure stage (G-rotor and pendulum slide cell pump) 
are used for the S63 top (S63TU) engine. 

The special features of the oil supply in the S63 top (S63TU) engine are: 

• Two-stage oil pump 

• Tensioning rail for the oil pump drive 

• Additional intake pipe. 

3.1. Overview 

The following graphic provides an overview of the oil supply and shows the hydraulic oil circuit diagram 
and the actual layout of the oil ducts in the engine.

3.2. Oil pump and pressure control 

The S63 top (S63TU) engine has an volume-flow-controlled oil pump with intake and pressure stage 
in the one housing. The oil pump is fixed to the upper oil pan section. 

A rotor style pump is used as an intake stage, which transfers the engine oil from the front area of the 
oil pan to the rear area of the oil pan by an additional intake pipe. 


36 


















S63TU Engine 

3. Oil Supply 

To supply the engine with oil pressure the known volume-flow-controlled pendulum slide cell pump is 
used. The intake pipe is positioned deep in the rear area of the oil pan to guarantee a definite oil sup¬ 
ply- 

information on the operating principle of a volume-flow-controlled oil pump can be found in the ST501 
New Engine Technology "N63 Engine training material" available on ICP and TIS.

3.3. Oil filtering and cooling 

The S63 top (S63TU) engine uses a full-flow oil filter familiar to the N63 engine. It is bolted into the 
oil pan from below. The oil filter drain plug is not used. A filter bypass valve is integrated in the oil filter 
housing.

3.3.1. Oil cooling 

The S63 top (S63TU) engine has an oil-air heat exchanger for cooling the engine oil which is attached 
below the cooling module in the front bumper. To allow quick heating of the engine oil, a thermostat is 
integrated in the oil pan. The thermostat opens from an engine oil temperature of 100 °C and allows 
the oil to flow through the cooler. 

3.3.2. Oil filtering 

The S63 top (S63TU) engine has a filter bypass valve which can open a bypass around the filter if the 
engine oil is cold and thick. This occurs if the pressure difference between before and after the filter 
exceeds approx. 2.5 bar. The permissible pressure difference has been increased from 2.0 to 2.5 bar 


38 







S63TU Engine 

3. Oil Supply 

in order to protect the lead-free crankshaft and connecting rod bearings. This ensures that the filter is 
bypassed much less frequently and any dirt particles are filtered out. The filter bypass valve is integrat¬ 
ed in the oil filter housing. 


3.4. Oil monitoring 

3.4.1. Oil level 

For monitoring the oil level the known oil condition sensor (QLT) is used. There is no evaluation of the 
oil condition. 


3.5. Oil spray nozzles 

In the S63 top (S63TU) engine some components which cannot be reached directly by an oil duct are 
lubricated and/or cooled by oil spray nozzles. 

3.5.1. Piston crown cooling 

The oil spray nozzles for piston crown cooling, as used in the S63 top (S63TU) engine. They incorpo¬ 
rate a non-return valve to allow them to open and close only from a specific oil pressure. Each cylinder 
has its own oil spray nozzle, which obtains the correct installation position through its design. In addi¬ 
tion to the piston crown cooling, these are also responsible for the lubrication of the piston wrist pins.

and a lower section, the oil pump drive. 

Camshaft drive 

The oil spray nozzles for the lubrication of the timing chains are integrated in the chain tensioner of the 
specific banks. They spray the oil directly onto the timing chain. The timing chain of the camshaft drive 
is designed as a toothed roller-type chain.

4.1.1. Engine cooling circuit 

The engine cooling is done by a conventional coolant pump. In the S63 top (S63TU) engine, a high¬ 
er coolant flow rate is achieved by the modified impeller geometry of the coolant pump. The cylinder 
head cooling has also been optimized. The cooling module only comes in one variant. 

The electric fan has a nominal power of 850 W. 

The following graphics show the installation locations and layout of the components.

Components of exhaust turbocharger cooling circuit 

The conventional coolant pump is driven by a belt and cannot be used for cooling the exhaust tur¬ 
bocharger after the engine has shut down. For this reason there is an electric coolant pump, which 
works at a power of 20 W. This is done by a separate cooling circuit. This circuit can also be activated 
during engine operation, the electric coolant pump can be switched on taking into account the follow¬ 
ing factors: 

• Coolant temperature at engine outlet 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected fuel quantity. 

The heat input into the engine is calculated using these values. The after-run of the electric coolant 
pump can last up to 30 minutes. To improve the cooling effect, the electric fan is activated and can run 
for up to a max. of 11 minutes.

4.1.2. Charge air cooler and DME cooling circuit 

To guarantee sufficient cooling of the charge air, the coolant-air heat exchangers have increased in size 
for the S63TU engine in comparison to the S63 engine. These are supplied with coolant by an inde¬ 
pendent cooling system with two (50 W) electric coolant pumps. The cooling circuit for the charge air 
cooling is combined with the Digital Engine Electronics (DME) and contain a radiator and two auxiliary 
coolers in the front bumper on the left and right sides.

Components 

Both 50 W pumps have a self-diagnosis and dry-run protection. If the pump speed increases by 15 
rpms over a pre determined period, the auxiliary water pumps are switched off and an fault code is 
stored in the DME. The expansion tank does not have a coolant level switch and does not automatical¬ 
ly detect when the fluid level is too low. In the case of a lack of fluid in the cooling circuit of the charge 
air cooler and DME, a warning light in the instrument panel signals either too high an intake air temper¬ 
ature with a parallel reduction in power or insufficient DME cooling. A Check Control message also ap¬ 
pears.

4.2. Heat management 

The S63 top (S63TU) engine has the same heat management function in the Digital Engine Electron¬ 
ics (DME) as in the N55 engine. This includes independent control of the electric cooling components 
of electric fan, map thermostat and coolant pumps. 

4.2.1. Coolant pump 

The S63 top (S63TU) engine has a total of four electric coolant pumps in addition to the mechani¬ 
cal pumps. One for the passenger compartment heating, another for the cooling of the exhaust tur¬ 
bocharger and two additional electric coolant pumps for cooling the charge air cooler and DME. 

A 

If the coolant pump is removed and then to be reused, it is important to ensure that it is set down still 
filled with coolant. Drying out may cause the bearings to stick. The reason for this is that the coolant 
pump may not run, which in turn may result in damage to the engine. 

Before installing, turn the pump impeller manually to ensure that it moves freely. 


4.2.2. Map thermostat 

The S63 top (S63TU) engine is fitted with a map thermostat which has the following technical data in 
non-electrically controlled mode: 

• Opening start at 105 °C 

• Complete opening at 120 °C. 

In addition, an electric heater in the map thermostat can be used to make the thermostat open at a 
lower coolant temperature.

5. Air Intake/Exhaust Emission System 

The air intake and exhaust emission systems are in principle comparable with those in the S63 engine. 
The list below shows the most important changes to the air intake and exhaust emission systems: 

• Flow-optimized air intake system 

• Hot film air mass meter 7 

• Adaptation of the air intake system with regard to the Valvetronic servomotor 

• Enlarged air-coolant heat exchanger for increasing the cooling power and reducing the pres¬ 
sure losses 

• Optimized exhaust manifold.

The S63 top (S63TU) engine has its own intake silencer for each bank. These also hold the hot film air 
mass meters. 


5.2.2. Hot film air mass meter 

The S63 top (S63TU) engine is fitted with the hot film air mass meter 7, which is very similar to the one 
in the N20 engine. 

A 

Failure or disconnection of the hot film air mass meter does not immediately result in emergency en¬ 
gine operation. However, impaired mixture preparation and therefore increased emission levels are 
possible, which is why the emissions warning lamp lights up. 


5.2.3. Intake manifold 

The volume of the air intake system has been optimized and it has a flow-optimized connection for the 
throttle body. In comparison to previous turbocharged BMW engines the S63TU does not use a blow- 
off valve. The use of Valvetronic and special tuning rendered it unnecessary.

The S63 top (S63TU) engine features two exhaust turbochargers with TwinScroll technology. It in¬ 
cludes at the turbine inlet two separate ducts in which the exhaust gas is routed from two cylinders to 
the turbine vanes. The turbines and compressor have been slightly redesigned, with this design the 
exhaust turbocharger is not sensitive to pump. With these upgrades and the use of Valvetronic along 
with special programing the blow-off valve is no longer necessary thus they are not installed.

S63TU Engine 

5. Air Intake/Exhaust Emission System 

5.3.1. Function 

The designation TwinScroll denotes an exhaust turbocharger with a twin-scroll turbine housing. 

The S63TU is fitted with 2 segment four into two exhaust manifold that connects both cylinder banks 
in an ideal configuration where the exhaust gas pulses from cylinders 1/6 and 4/7 are fed to the ex¬ 
haust turbocharger installed over cylinder bank 5/8 (L) and the exhaust gas from cylinders 2/8 and 3/5 
is fed to the exhaust turbocharger installed over cylinder bank 1 -4 (R), independently from each other. 
In this way, so-called pulse supercharging is used to greater effect. 

This creates a spacing of 360° of crankshaft angle between the two exhaust bank cycles within the ex¬ 
haust flute that feeds each twin scroll turbocharger impeller. The effective utilization of the exhaust gas 
energy delivers optimum de-throttling and ideal response characteristics. 

More Information on the functioning principle of the TwinScroll exhaust turbocharger can be found in 
the "N20 Engine training material" available on TIS and ICR 


5.4. Exhaust emission system 


5.4.1. Exhaust manifold 

The S63TU exhaust manifold has been flow-optimized in comparison to the S63 engine. The flow-op¬ 
timized manifold is a four-into-two type (two overlapping), which is necessary for the special function 
of the TwinScroll turbocharger. The double wall design of the previous S63 exhaust manifold has been 
discontinued and replaced with an open pipe design so that the generated heat can now escape up¬ 
wards through the ventilated heat shields. There are also corrugated elements mounted at the exhaust 
manifolds in order to balance the thermomechanical movements in the individual sections of the ex¬ 
haust manifold.

6. Vacuum System 

The vacuum system of the S63 top (S63TU) engine differs from the S63 engine. The vacuum reservoir 
and the pressure converter have a new EBO and the vacuum lines have been adapted.

7. Fuel Preparation 

The S63 top (S63TU) engine makes use of high-pressure injection, which was introduced in the N55 
engine. It differs from high-precision injection (HPI) in that it uses solenoid valve injectors with mul¬ 
ti-hole nozzles. 


7.1. Overview 

The following overview shows the fuel preparation of the S63 top (S63TU) engine. It corresponds to 
the systems with direct fuel injection in other BMW models.

Fuel supply line 


Bosch high-pressure fuel injectors with the designation HDEV5.2 are used. The high pressure pump is 
already known from the 4,8 and 12-cylinder engines. An innovation in the S63 top (S63TU) engine is 
the fact that the high-pressure lines from rail to injector are now no longer threaded at the rail end, but 
welded similar to the N20. 

A_ 

Do not open the fuel system if the coolant temperature is above 40°C/104°F. The residual 
pressure in the high pressure fuel system could cause bodily injury. 

It is essential to observe the utmost cleanliness when working on the high pressure fuel system and to 
follow the proper working procedures described in the repair instructions. Even minute soiling or dam¬ 
age at the thread connections of the high pressure lines could cause leaks. 

When working on the fuel system of the S63TU engine, it is important to ensure that the ignition coils 
are not wet with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by sustained contact 
with fuel. This could result in arcing at the top of the spark plug and misfiring. 

• Before making any modifications to the fuel system, always remove the ignition coils and pro¬ 
tect the spark plug shaft against the ingress of fuel by covering them with a cloth 

• Before reinstalling the solenoid valve injectors, remove the ignition coils and ensure that great¬ 
est possible cleanliness is maintained. 

• Ignition coils heavily saturated with fuel must be replaced. 


7.2. Fuel pump control 

The fuel is delivered from the fuel tank through the electric fuel pump via the feed line at a primary 
pressure of 5 bar to the high pressure pump. The primary pressure is monitored via the low-pressure 
sensor. The fuel is sent from the electric fuel pump as required. In the event of malfunction of the sen¬ 
sor the electric fuel pump continues to operate at 100% delivery rate with terminal 15 ON. 


7.3. High-pressure pump 

A Bosch high pressure pump is used. This is a single-plunger pump which is driven from the exhaust 
camshaft via a triple cam. So that sufficient fuel pressure is guaranteed in all operating conditions of 
the engine, a high-pressure pump is used in the S63 top (S63TU) engine for each bank. 

For further information on the high-pressure pump, please refer to the “N74 Engine” Training material 
available on TIS and ICR

7.4. Injectors 

The Bosch HDEV5.2 solenoid valve injector with an inward-opening multi-hole valve is used. The 
HDEV5.2 is configured for a system pressure of up to 200 bar. 

These injectors are already in use in the N55 and N20 engine. 

For further information on injector activation, refer to the section entitled Engine Management System. 



A 

The housing of the solenoid valve injectors can only withstand a certain tensile force and a certain 
torque. It is essential when removing and installing the injectors to use special tools and follow the 
specific procedure set out in the repair instructions, as otherwise the injectors will be damaged. 


67

8. Fuel Supply 

The fuel supply is vehicle-specific. The difference to the FI 0 production vehicles is the increase of the 
fuel tank capacity by 10 liters (2.64 gallons) to a total of 80 liters (21 gallons). The electric fuel pump is 
adapted to the engine at an increased delivery rate.

9.2.1. Overall function 

The Digital Engine Electronics (DME) is the computing and switching center of the engine control sys¬ 
tem. Sensors on the engine and the vehicle deliver the input signals. The signals for activating the ac¬ 
tuators are calculated from the input signals, the nominal values calculated using a computing model 
in the DME control unit and the stored program maps. The DME control unit activates the actuators di¬ 
rectly or by relays. 

The DME control unit is woken up via the wake-up line (terminal 15 Wake up) by the Car Access Sys¬ 
tem (CAS). 


76 



























S63TU Engine 

9. Engine Management System 

The after-run starts after terminal 15 OFF. The adaptation values are stored during the after-run. The 
DME control unit uses a bus signal to signal its readiness to “go to sleep”. When all the participating 
control units have signalled their readiness to “go to sleep”, the bus I outputs a bus signal and the con¬ 
trol units terminate communication five seconds later. 

The circuit board in the DME control unit houses two sensors: a temperature sensor and an ambient 
pressure sensor. The temperature sensor is used to monitor the temperature of the components in the 
DME control unit. The ambient pressure is required for calculating the mixture composition.
