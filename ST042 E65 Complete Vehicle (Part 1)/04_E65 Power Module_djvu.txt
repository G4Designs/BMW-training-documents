Positive Battery Cable 


An aluminum battery cable in the E65 is used for the first time by a BMW automobile. The 
cable is flat (120mm 2 ) and runs along the vehicle interior from a junction box ahead of the 
spare tire well to the interior side of the front bulkhead. A smaller copper cable runs paral¬ 
lel to it in the vehicle interior. That smaller cable is supplied via a 250 amp fuse located 
inside the same junction box that feeds the aluminum cable. 



Power Module 









Battery 

The E65 is fitted with a single maintenance free battery (12 V/110 Ah). The battery like other 
BMW models is located in the right side of the trunk below the vehicle jack.

Power Module 










Electronic Battery Master Switch 

The electronic battery master switch is made up of 4 MOS-FET output stages (S Bat) and 
connects the input terminal 30 with the outputs KL 30U and KL 30B on the Power Module. 

The following functions are controlled by means of the Power Module according to the 
position of the battery switch: 

• Storage mode 

• Closed circuit current monitoring 

• Electronic fuses 

• Automatic electrical system isolation 


High-Current Terminals (RADSOK®) 

New high-current terminals are used for the first time. The high-current terminals are on the 
input terminal 30 and the outputs terminal 30U and terminal 30B. These contacts are capa¬ 
ble of carrying current peaks (short term) of 220 A. 

Advantages: 

• Continuous load capacity of up to 100 A 

• Excellent and consistent current conduction over long periods 

• Low contact resistance 

• Low voltage drop even with large temperature rise 

• Consistently good spring characteristics 

• Contacts are self-cleaning (contacts have a slight amount of allowable movement) 

The contacts are coated in a silver alloy. Compared with tin, nickel, gold and copper, silver 
has the lowest specific electrical resistance. 

In spite of the high currents, the high-current sockets are not soldered to the cable as a 
special crimping technique ensures an excellent connection.

Power Module 



Inputs 


Terminal 30 

The battery positive terminal is connected directly to the load input of the Power Module. 

Battery Switch 

The battery switch (BS) offers the vehicle owner and the service department the choice 
between the settings ON ("closed circuit current monitoring") and OFF ("storage mode"). It 
is located above the PM on the right hand side of the luggage compartment. 


ON OFF 



Interior Lighting Button 

This controls the interior lighting and is located on the front interior lighting unit. The possi¬ 
ble settings are "Automatic control", "On" , "Off" and “Workshop mode” (hold for 3 sec¬ 
onds). 

Exterior Trunk Lid Release Button (TOEHK) 

This button is a direct input to the Power Module. The trunk lid is released by means of the 
button on the outside of the trunk lid. 

Trunk Lock Actuator Switch 

The switch in the trunk lock actuator is used to inform the Power Module as to the position 
of the lock actuator and to synchronize the SCA. it also controls the luggage compartment 
lighting, the monitoring of the alarm system and the trunk lid warning light. 

SCA Contact 

This input is used to signal the PM that the SCA has rotated 180°. (used to switch off the 
electric motor) 

15_w (wake-up) 

This is a redundant signal from the Car Access System which wakes up the Power Module. 

Battery Temperature Sensor 

Measures the temperature directly on the battery negative terminal. This information is 
used for the "optimum charging" function. The measuring range is -25°C to +75°C. 

K-CAN Periphery 

Enables communication with the vehicle network.

Power Module 





The advantages of this arrangement are: 

• The exterior lighting can remain on (for safety reasons) even if the electronic battery 
master switch is off. 

• The alarm system is always armed. 

• No additional fuses and wiring for actuators in nearby locations. 

Fuses 

The outputs for the rear window heater, Terminal R and Terminal 15, are not protected by 
conventional fuses. They are supplied via a power transistor (MOS-FET) in the Power 
Module. 

By measuring the current and comparing it with stored threshold levels, the Power Module 
can detect a short circuit and disconnect the circuit if needed. The outputs for CAS, DWA 
system and DME are protected by internal electronic fuses: FI, F2 and F3. 


14 


Power Module 



Power Module Functions 


Optimum Charging 

The battery voltage can fluctuate between 14.0 V and 15.5 V. The optimum charge volt¬ 
age is set according to the charge level of the battery, the battery temperature and the sta¬ 
tus of the external lights (higher charging voltage with lights off). The maximum setting is 
16 V. 


Battery Charge Level Detection 

The Power Module knows what the charge level of the battery is at any time by calculating 
the battery current when the vehicle is being driven and measuring the discharge current. 
When the vehicle is not in use, the charge level is re-calculated and updated by measuring 
the closed circuit battery voltage. If the vehicle battery is replaced it must be registered with 
the Power Module so that the stored values can be deleted and a new calculation started. 
This operation is described in “Service Functions”. 

Temperature-Dependent Battery Charging Voltage 

By using a charging characteristic map stored in the PM, the charge voltage of the gener¬ 
ator is adjusted according to the battery temperature. The diagram below shows the com¬ 
munication path necessary for the Power Module to inform the generator to increase or 
decrease charge voltage output. 



K CAN S 



The Power Module detects the temperature of the battery and places the instruction 
"Increase charge voltage" on the K-CAN Periphery. The Car Access System (CAS) pass¬ 
es the message on to the K-CAN System bus. 

The Central Gateway Module (ZGM) receives the message. Performing its function as a 
"gateway control unit", it passes the message on to the PT-CAN. 


The DME (ECM) module receives the request to increase the charge voltage over the PT- 
CAN. 


Power Module 







The generator then receives the request to increase the charge voltage via the BSD lead 
(bit serial data interface). The electronic evaluation unit in the generator then adjusts the 
charge voltage accordingly. 

If the temp, sensor is detected as defective then the charging voltage will be fixed at 14.3V. 



Increasing Idle Speed to Improve Battery Charging 

In order to drain as little energy as possible from the battery during freezing weather (below 
34°F) the idling speed may be increased. 

This ensures that the battery charge level is kept high. If the charge level falls below the 
calculated minimum level for starting, the idling speed is increased to 750 rpm. 

The calculation of the minimum level for starting takes account of the temperature and the 
condition/age of the battery. 


16 


Power Module 















Load-Circuit Peak Reduction 


If battery discharge is detected while the engine is running (despite increased idling speed), 
the power supply to electrical consumer circuits are gradually reduced or completely shut 
off according to a table of priorities. The consumer systems concerned are divided into two 
groups: Priority group A and Priority group B. 

Priority group A 

• Rear window heater 

• Headlight washing 

• All seat heaters 

• Active seat 

• Seat ventilation 

• Steering wheel heater 

• Mirror heater 

• Windshield wiper blade heating 

• Wet arm (washer hose in wiper arm) heating 

Priority A systems are dependent on battery SoC (State of Charge) and generator output 
during the operation of the consumer. 

Priority B systems are only dependent on the battery SoC. 

The Power Module also sends out a telegram indicating the status of the Load-circuit peak 
reduction function. The priority level of the message is classified by a number 0 through 6. 

• 0 = Normal operation without peak reduction (KL 15 “ON”) 

• 1 = Terminal R “ON” without peak reduction OR generator defect or under-voltage 

acknowledged. 

• 4 = Corresponds to maximum peak reduction. 

• 5 = Corresponds to medium peak reduction. 

• 6 = Corresponds to minimum peak reduction. 

The computation by the Power Module to determine which priority level is necessary is 
based on the battery SoC. Example: the threshold for priority level 6 is a 65% SoC. 

Current vehicle priority levels can be displayed in the Diagnosis Program. 


Priority group B 

• IHKA fan (except during defrosting) 

• Rear IHKA fan (only for E66)

Shut-Down of Consumer Circuits in the Event of Low Voltage 

If the battery voltage drops below 10.5 V (for 5 seconds) due to high load levels, the Power 
Module sends out an instruction to increase the idling speed and to activate prioritized 
shut-down of electrical consumer circuits. 

At the same time, the power outputs of the Power Module (interior lighting, consumer iso¬ 
lation circuit in roof/body zone) are switched off. 

The following Check Control message appears:

Power Module 
























16 Minute Shut-Down of Consumer Circuits (Sleep mode) 

To prevent battery discharge by consumer items mistakingly left on, the interior lighting cir¬ 
cuit (IB) and consumer circuits-roof zone (VA-D) are shut off 16 minutes after terminal R is 
switched off. 


Shut-Down of Auxiliary Consumers 

Auxiliary consumer circuits are items such as the CD, DWA, LM, EGS and IHKA (rest func¬ 
tion). 

In order to ensure that the car is capable of starting, the charge level (SoC-State of Charge) 
of the battery is monitored when the vehicle is at rest. 

The minimum battery SoC required to ensure that the car can be started again is a 
calculated value. The calculation takes into account the: 

• Battery temperature measured over last few days 

• Engine type 

• Capacity of the battery fitted (110Ah for the 745i). 

The SoC calculation is displayed as a percentage of battery capacity ( A fully charged bat¬ 
tery is considered 80%). 

If the charge level of the battery gets close to that calculated minimum level as a result of 
the operation of an auxiliary consumer unit, the Power Module instructs that circuit to 
switch off. 

Two modes of operation are distinguished when shutting down auxiliary consumer circuits: 

• Auxiliary consumer with terminal R on. 

• Auxiliary consumer with terminal 0 (ignition off). 


20 


Power Module 



Auxiliary Consumers and Terminal R 

When terminal 15 changes to terminal R, the message Priority level 1 is broadcast. 
Reduction of power consumption if necessary is then controlled on the basis of the table 
on page 18 and 19. 

The charge level of the battery is calculated. If it is still below the minimum level for start¬ 
ing the car, the following Check Control message appears: 


Check Control Message Message displayed in Cause 

displayed in KOMBI Control Display 


Recharge Battery! 


A 


Recharge battery! Battery discharged 

Battery heavily discharged. 

Charge by driving for longer period 
or by using external charger. 

Battery will be disconnected soon. 


If the charge level does not improve, after 5 minutes the PM issues the "Shutdown 
counter" message (shut-down message is to inform modules to store any information prior 
to power being switched off). After a further 90 seconds, the vehicle's electrical system is 
shut down. 

This is on condition that no safety related consumers are switched on. 

If safety related consumers are on (e.g. hazard lights), the battery is not disconnected from 
the electrical system when the minimum battery SoC for starting the car is reached. The 
battery is allowed to fully discharge. 

Auxiliary Consumers and Terminal 0 

If the driver switches on an auxiliary consumer it logs itself on by issuing the message 
"Auxiliary consumer power management". By doing so, it triggers the PM to precisely cal¬ 
culate the battery charge level. 

Following a successful log-on, the auxiliary consumer goes into operation and the charge 
level of the battery is monitored. 

If the charge level falls below the minimum level for starting the car, the following Check 
Control message appears: 


Check Control Message

Power Module 








Five minutes later, if no legally required consumers are switched on, the PM automatically 
switches to "closed-circuit current monitoring" mode. 


Closed-Circuit Current Monitoring (Standby Current) 

When terminal 0 is active, the PM switches over to closed-circuit current monitoring after 
60 minutes. If an operation is performed on the car before 60 minutes has elapsed (e.g. 
central locking, trunk opened), the timer starts from the beginning again. 

Once that period has ended, the closed-circuit current should not exceed 80 mA. If the 
closed-circuit current exceeds 80 mA, after 5 minutes the PM issues the "Shutdown 
counter" message. After a further 90 seconds, the vehicle's electrical system is shut down 
for 5 seconds. 

If the quiescent current still exceeds 80 mA when the system is switched on again, the 
sequence described above is repeated. If the quiescent current is then still over 80 mA, 
the system is permanently shut down via the electronic battery master switch. 

The fault is recorded in the Power Module's fault memory (with details of environmental 
conditions and cause). 

When the signal “15w” from the CAS is detected, the electronic battery master switch is 
closed and the following Check Control message is displayed:

circuit current draw 


Closed-circuit current monitoring is automatically cancelled by a message from the LM that 
the hazard warning lights are active. 

When terminal R is switched off, current monitoring is also immediately activated. Normal 
current load on the vehicle drops in stages according to the vehicle programming for sleep 
mode (see the chart on the following page). 

If the monitored current is more than 120 amps (even as a random spike) , the interior light¬ 
ing, roof area consumers and body zone consumer circuits are immediately switched off.

Storage Mode 


By switching “OFF” the battery switch, the Power 
Module goes into Storage Mode 30 minutes after 
terminal R switches off. 

Before disconnecting, the PM sends out the "Shutdown" signal. After a further 90 seconds 
the shut down is completed. If the ignition switch is turned to terminal R “On”, a Check 
Control message is issued which informs the driver that the vehicle is in Storage Mode. 

The following CC message appears:

When the signal “15w” or change-over of the battery switch to "closed-circuit current mon¬ 
itoring" is detected, the electronic battery master switch is closed. 

The car can still be started and driven in storage mode. All systems remain functional. 

The CC message remains active. 

When "Terminal R Off" is active, disconnection is carried out after 30 minutes (as explained 
above). 

If no function of any kind is activated over a period of 3 weeks, the battery is disconnected 
completely from the vehicle's electrical system. This prevents battery discharge. This func¬ 
tion is independant of the position of the battery switch. 


Electronic Fuse 

If a short circuit current of over 250 A is detected, the battery master switch is opened. 

When the wake-up signal “15w” from the CAS is detected, then an attempt is made to 
close the battery master switch again. 

This procedure is repeated continually until the short circuit has been eliminated. 


24 


Power Module 
























Central Battery Voltage Notification 


The Power Module continuously measures the battery voltage. This information is made 
available to all other control units via the bus link. This can be used, for example, to enable 
continuous running of the sliding/tilting sunroof regardless of battery voltage. 

Central battery voltage notification eliminates the need for individual measurement of bat¬ 
tery voltage by each control unit. 

Rear Window Heater (HHS) 

The electronic rear window heater output stage of the PM is activated by a "HHS On" (K- 
CAN-S via CAS via K-CAN -P) message from the IHKA control unit. Control is directly by 
the final stage. 

Interior Lighting 

The interior lighting is subdivided between three outputs (groups): 

• IB (interior lighting) 

• VA-K (consumer isolation circuit, body zone) 

• VA-D (consumer isolation circuit, roof zone) 

The interior lighting is controlled by the PM, the outputs are 12V stabilized-voltage. 

VA-K and VA-D are switched on/off according to the status of the relevant switches. 

Trunk Lid and Fuel Filler Flap Control 

The Power Module controls the following trunk-lid related functions of the body zone elec¬ 
tronics: 

• Trunk lock actuator 

• Trunk lid automatic soft close motor (SCA) 

• Fuel filler flap lock actuator 

The necessary software, such as on times and repeat lockouts is integrated in the PM. For 
more details, refer to the chapter: Central Body Electronics. 

The PM monitors the trunk lid for the DWA system via the trunk lock actuator (ZV) contact 
switch. 


25 

Power Module 



Data Memory 


The data memory stores data relevant to the vehicle. That information provides a status 
read-out of the battery load and life. It can be accessed by way of the diagnosis function. 
The data memory will be used in future to obtain a load profile of the battery in normal oper¬ 
ation that will be analyzed for the purposes of "condition based servicing." 

Emergency-Mode Functions 

Battery Temperature Sensor 

In the event of a defective sensor, a short circuit or an implausible value, the substitute value 
of 20 °C is assumed. This corresponds to a fixed charge voltage of 14.3 V at the battery. 

Battery capacity (SoC) is calculated using the substitute value. 

Battery Switch 

If a fault is detected in the battery switch, the Power Module switches to Storage mode as 
if the switch were in the “OFF” position. 

Terminal 15w 

Shut-down of the PM in the absence of terminal 15w is prevented by the following dupli¬ 
cated signals: 

• Terminal 15 (from CAS via bus link) 

• Road speed > 2 km/h (from DSC via bus link) 

• System voltage > 13.2 V (PM central battery voltage notification) 

Bus Communication 

If bus communication is not possible, all information is "frozen."

Workshop Hints 

Battery Charging 

As with previous models, a battery charger can be connected in the engine compartment 
to the battery junction point or directly to the battery in the trunk. The PM detects an exter¬ 
nal battery charger if the battery voltage is above 13.2 V for 1 hour without the engine run¬ 
ning. 

Following detection of external battery charging, a battery charge level of 80% is reported 
even if the charge level is higher or lower than that figure. 

Cigarette Lighter Battery Charging Function 

A trickle charger can also be connected to the cigarette lighter. However, the cigarette 
lighter is supplied by the body-zone consumer isolation circuit (VA-K) via a relay. 

If the "terminal R Off" signal is present for more than 60 minutes, that relay will be switched 
off by the consumer shutdown function. That would mean that a charger connected to the 
cigarette lighter would be disconnected from the battery. 

To prevent this, the consumer shut-down function can be deactivated. This is performed by 
the following procedure: 

Slide the battery switch off and on again twice within two seconds. 


1. Switch ON (starting position) 

2. Switch OFF 

3. Switch ON 

4. Switch OFF 

5. Switch ON

The function is cancelled by: "terminal 15 On" , switching the battery switch from "OFF" to 
"ON" or failure of the battery voltage to reach 12.6 V after 6 hours of charging.

Diagnosis 

All inputs/outputs that are part of the Power Module can be diagnosed by Test Modules or 
status checked by the Control Unit Functions of the Diagnosis Program. The outputs can 
also be activated by Component Activation and the power consumption displayed. 

The Diagnosis Program is based on the E46 concept. 

All electronic fuses and the electronic battery master switch are monitored for short cir¬ 
cuits/circuit breaks. In the event of a fault, an appropriate entry is made in the PM's 
fault memory and, if appropriate, a check control message initiated. 

Service Functions 

Sleep Mode Activation 

This function can be used to put the control units into sleep mode. The battery switch must 
be set to “ON” when using this feature. The Test module will indicate whether the function 
was successful or not. 

Battery Replacement Registration (Must be performed any time a battery is replaced)* 

This Service Function informs the PM that the battery has been replaced. It completes the 
following operations: 

• The battery capacity is set to 80%. 

• The current odometer reading is stored. 

The odometer readings at which the last seven battery replacements took place can be 
read off from the Diagnosis Requests of Control Unit Functions. 

• The stored battery statistics (current, voltage, battery charge level) are deleted. 

• The stored temperature statistics are deleted. 

Transport Mode Clearing 

Vehicles that arrive at the BMW centers may have the Transport Mode cleared by using the 
Test Module under the Service Functions menu. Different from the Storage Mode 
described on page 24, certain consumers such as the radio, interior lights, and electric win¬ 
dows (except drivers side) are permanently switched off.

Review Questions 

1. Name a feature of the Power Module that is responsible for ensuring that important 
systems have power, even if a voltage loss while driving is detected. How can the 
Power Module react to a loss in power? 


2. What information does the Power Module use to calculate the optimum charge voltage? 


3. Which control unit provides the 15w (wake-up) signal to the Power Module? What 
would happen if the wire for the 15w input were damaged? 


4. How would the driver of the vehicle know that the battery switch was in the OFF 
position? 


5. How is the Power Module informed that an external battery charger has been 
connected? 


6. What must be performed to the Power Module after replacing a battery? 


7. Why is the Power Module responsible for controlling the trunk and filler flap lock 
actuators?
