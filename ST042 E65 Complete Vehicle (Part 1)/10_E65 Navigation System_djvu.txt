E65 Navigation System 




Introduction 


The navigation computer of the E65 is the control unit that provides navigation, telematics 
and Online services (planned). 

In terms of the functionality, the navigation computer corresponds to the Mk-3 navigation 
computer introduced for model year 2001. A number of additional functions however, have 
been integrated. 

• New, larger screen (8.8 inches) with an 8:3 size ratio. 

• Simultaneous map and arrow presentation modes. 

• Map or arrow presentation in assistance window always possible (simultaneously with 
radio menu, etc.). 

• New-route calculation is faster when the driver has to deviate from the planned route. 

• Improved map presentation graphics. 

• Faster on-screen map builds. 

• "Avoiding toll road" as a new routing criteria. 

• Multiple destinations can be grouped in a destinations list and picked up one after the 
other. 

• Route information arrows, distance and name of the next street shown in the instrument 
cluster. 

• Extended voice output ("... follow the 195 interstate"). 

• Direct destination home (also by voice command). 

• Avoiding individual roads or entire roadway sections. 

• Help text explanations for individual menu items. 


Like all information and communication systems, the control unit is connected to the MOST 
bus.

Components 

Navigation Computer (NAV. 01) 

The navigation computer is located in the left 
rear corner of the luggage compartment. 

Similar to the Mk-3 computer, the E65 NAV. 01 
contains: 

• CD drive. 

• Hardware for navigation, telematics and 
online services function. 

• Transceiver for interface with the MOST 
network. (Transceiver contains two nodes) 

• Gyro sensor. 

• GPS receiver. 

• Output for RGB (graphics interface) 

• Cooling fan for unit. 

Building maps on the Control Display is now considerably faster than before. This improve¬ 
ment was achieved by means of modifications to the hardware. 

The connection to the MOST bus is by a standardized MOST transceiver. The MOST trans¬ 
ceiver incorporates two interfaces (nodes). 

Each MOST telegram is divided into 3 parts. 

• Control data 

• Asynchronous data (e.g. navigation system, arrow presentation) 

• Synchronous data (e.g. audio, video signals) 

A node can analyze only two signals at a time, this is the reason why two nodes are nec¬ 
essary for the navigation computer. In the Control Display self-test, both nodes are shown 
as control units but only one node can be displayed as a recognized control unit. The sec¬ 
ond node is always displayed as "wait" (normally control unit not recognized).

GPS Antenna 

The antenna for the navigation system is incorporated 
into the shark-fin antenna that is mounted on the roof. 

This antenna contains a dual band antenna for the 
telephone as well as the GPS antenna. 

1. GPS antenna 

2. GPS connector 



Speed Signal 

The road speed signal is provided directly by the DSC. The signal is processed from the 
left front wheel sensor. 

MOST 

The navigation computer is part of the MOST network. 

Like all the control units in the MOST system, the nav¬ 
igation computer is woken up by light signals on the 
MOST bus, this means that the nav. computer has to 
be in permanent operation. 


Standby current consumption is less than 0.02 mA. 


The data for the route arrows displayed in the instru¬ 
ment cluster and in the Control Display is carried on 
the MOST bus. 

MOST 

RGB Lines 

The navigation computer sends the signal for map display directly to the Control Display 
along separate RGB lines.

Principle of Operation 

Navigation Display 


The information is presented in the Control Display and the instrument cluster. The display 
window in the Control Display has been re-sized to a width-to-height ratio of 8:3 (previous 
wide-screen BM 16:9). 

When Route Guidance (with arrow display 
selected) is active, the navigation display also 
appears automatically in the instrument cluster. 

Display of the information in the instrument clus¬ 
ter cannot be deactivated while the route guid¬ 
ance function is active.

The display of navigation information in the Control Display can be deactivated by select¬ 
ing some other function. 



1. Arrow display in 
Kombi. 

2. Arrow display in 
control area and map 
in assistance screen 
of Control Display.

New Functions 


New Route 

New-route calculation is faster when the driver has to deviate from the planned route. 
Instead of recalculating the entire route when the driver deviates from the planned route, 
the computer re-calculates only a section of the route before issuing the next instruction, 
this saves time. 


Avoiding Toll Road 

This is a new selection that has been added to the route-selection menu along with the pre¬ 
vious: fastest route, main use of highways, least use of highways, etc.). 


Selection of Destination from Stored Memory 

Multiple destinations are stored in a destinations list. To select the current desired route 
from memory, the destination must be selected and placed as number 1.

Display of Navigation Data in the Instrument Cluster 

Route information, distance and the name of the next street can now be shown in the 
instrument cluster providing the driver with navigation data without having to look away 
from the road. 

1. Street name 

2. Distance until 
next turn. 

3. Route arrow

Extended Voice Instructions 

The voice instructions have a greater vocabulary thanks to the faster processor and 
greater system memory of the navigation computer, (e.g. “Continue straight ahead follow¬ 
ing 195”, instead of, “follow the main road”). 


Direct Home Function 

Selecting home is easier by storing it permanently in memory and selecting it from a “home” 
icon in the address book menu or using the Speech Processing System to access it.

Avoiding Sections of a Road or Complete Roads 

From the New Route menu individual roads or complete roadways can be barred and the 
navigation computer will develop a new route avoiding those specific roads. This is espe¬ 
cially useful to avoid long term construction sites or roads that are commonly congested 
with traffic. 


1. Avoid section. 

2. Avoid route

Review Questions 


1. Where is the antenna for the navigation system located? 


2. How many “nodes” are integrated in to the navigation computer? Why does it have that 
many? How can this affect troubleshooting a MOST bus problem? 


3. How does the navigation computer send display images to the Control Display and 
the instrument cluster?
