E66 Body Update 























Body 


The E66 is 140 mm longer as compared to the E65. The extra length requires necessary 
component changes to the body: 

• The roof and outer side frame. 

• The inner side frame is a component of the E65 that was separated and extended. 

• The floor pan, the rear engine support and the transmission support are E66 compo¬ 
nents that are shortened for the E65. 

• The rear doors and inner door panels. 

• The rear sills are reinforced by two additional sheet metal panels. 

• The side skin of the E66 is welded with double the amount of welds.

Bumpers 


Standard on the E66 only is a chrome bumper strip on both the front and rear bumpers. 




PDC 

Vehicles with the optional Park Distance Control 
system have the sensors integrated into the 
bumper and painted in the body color. 



Rear Doors 



The rear doors on the E66 are 140mm longer than the E65 rear doors. 

Further identity styling cues for E66 recognition include chrome strips 
integrated into the door handle assembly. These door handles will only 
be available on E66.

Door Latch Assembly 


Two versions of door latch mechanisms are installed in both the E66 and E65. The L-lock 
assembly is the basic latch on vehicles without options such as SCA and Comfort Access 
(available in the future). 

The M-lock assembly includes an extra motor for SCA functions and may be fitted with 
other options. The latch mechanisms are not interchangeable because the electrical con¬ 
nectors are different. 



L-Lock 

1. Receptacle for release button 

2. Cable for inner door handle 

3. 8-pin connector 

4. Child safety lock (rear door) 

5. 6-pin connector 

6. SCA 

7. Cable for outer door handle 

Glass 

The E66 is equipped with tempered safety glass (ESG) for all windows except the wind¬ 
shield. The windshield is made of laminated safety glass (VSG). 

For the infrared-reflectioning windows (VSG-IR), a solar radiation protection layer is vapor- 
deposited between the laminated safety glass. 

The protective glass does not feature a shatter protection film.

Windshield 


Windshields on all E66 vehicles are equipped with the following: 

• Rain Sensor 

• Anti -Glare Strip (with rain sensor only) 

• IR glass with radar window (with anti-glare strip and rain sensor) 


Rear Side Windows 

The rear door side windows on the E66 are 
140mm longer as compared to the E65. The 
quarter windows remain unchanged from the 
E65. 



Roof Trim 

The E66 has chrome moulding on the left and 
right side of the roof edge. 

This makes it possible to easily differentiate 
between the E65 and E66 at a first glance. 

The strip on the E65 is painted in the body color.

A fifth screw has been added to the front door 
trim panel. 

The screw is located in the front flange in the 
direction of the A-pillar (1 to the right). 



Assist Handles 

The assist handle grips (located 
roof liner) on the E66 are trimmed 


on the inner 
in wood. 



Front Seats 

The seats in the E66 feature a decorative wood 
strip clipped on the rear panel of the front seats. 

In addition, the rear storage pocket used in the 
E65 is replaced by a folding pocket in the E66. 

In the E66, there is a footwell light fitted under 
the front seats for the rear footwell.
