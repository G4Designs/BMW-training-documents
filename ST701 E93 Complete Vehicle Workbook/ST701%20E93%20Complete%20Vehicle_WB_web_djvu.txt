E93 Introduction 



The new E93 is the latest in a long line of 3-series convertibles 
from BMW starting with the E30. Since then, the 3-series 
convertible has evolved from a cloth top to the current retractable 
hard top (RHT). 

The RHT consists of steel roof panels which fold and stow away 
into the trunk. 

As far as vehicle dimensions are concerned, the E93 is longer, 
wider, taller and has a longer wheelbase. 

The E93 is also heavier than the E46, but maintains the same 
sporty characteristic as it’s predecessor.

E93 Body Construction 



As with all current BMW models, there is an extensive use of high 
strength steels. 

There is an “intelligent mix” of materials to provide the lightest 
possible weight with the best possible strength. 

The color illustrations above, demonstrate the distribution of the 
materials. For more information, refer to the E93 complete vehicle 
reference material in TIS and ICR 

The design of the E93 also allows for an increase in torsional 
rigidity over the E46 iC. The chart at the right illustrates these 
figures.

Body Reinforcements 



As with previous convertibles, additional reinforcement is added to 
supplement the rigidity of the body structure. 

The additional struts consist of: 

• Front end struts 

• Shock tower to bulkhead struts 

• Front axle subframe struts 

• Tension struts at rear 

• Strut in rollover protection system 

The cross-section of the sill has been additionally increased as 
compared to the E92.

General Vehicle Electrical 

The general vehicle electrical system includes the following: 

• Exterior lighting 

• Interior lighting 

• Central locking system 

• Anti-theft alarm system 

• Roof functions module 

• Seat with rear easy-entry 

• Changes in control units 

• Power windows. 


Exterior Lighting 

No changes have been made to the exterior lighting of the E93 Convertible compared to the E92 Coupe. The E93 Convertible is 
equipped as standard with bi-xenon lights. Adaptive headlights are optionally available in connection with the turn signal or direction 
indicator light. 

The E93 Convertible is equipped as standard with the daytime driving light function that is realized by the corona rings. The E93 
Convertible also features the welcome light function. The headlight assistant is optionally available. Important note on tail lights 


Interior Lighting 

The interior lighting system of the E93 Convertible was adopted from the E92 with ambient interior lighting in the door and side trim 
panels. For this reason, the general functions and the components of the interior lighting system will not be described in detail again here. 


The following minor changes have been made to the optional interior lights package: 

• No rear interior light in the roof

Central Locking System 

The central locking system has been adapted to the specific requirements of the Convertible. In addition to the basic functions of locking 
the doors, lids and flaps, two further functions have been added: automatic locking and opening of the glove compartment and the storage 
compartment in the center console. These functions are necessary for the purpose of providing a safe place to store objects with the 
hardtop open. 

Glove Compartment Locking 

The glove compartment is unlocked by electrical means. The reason for this is that a knee airbag is installed in US vehicles. The knee 
airbag is located in the lid to the glove compartment. 

The opener is located on the left on the glove compartment lid. The lid must be locked on both sides to ensure the resulting forces can 
be transmitted in the event of the knee airbag triggering. 

Opening Glove Compartment 

The opener is raised slightly to open the glove compartment. A microswitch sends a signal to the junction box which, in turn, activates an 
actuator motor in the glove compartment. The actuator motor with the gear mechanism pulls back the two locking rods so that the glove 
compartment lid can be opened. 

The power supply to the actuator motor is cut after a short time and the locking rods extend again. 

Closing Glove Compartment 

The ends of the locking rods are beveled. When closing the lid, the rods are pressed against a spring. When the lid is closed, the spring 
force pushes the locking rods back into the lock openings thus locking the glove compartment lid. 

Locking Glove Compartment 

The hotel switch is located in the glove compartment. The hotel switch can prevent unauthorized opening of the boot lid. For this 
purpose, the glove compartment is locked with the mechanical key at the lock barrel. 

Emergency Release of Glove Compartment 

In the event of the battery discharging or being defective, the glove compartment can be opened with the mechanical key.

Locking Function of Center Console 

The storage compartment, contains an actuator motor which locks the storage compartment. This actuator motor is driven directly by the 
junction box when central arrest is activated. 

Emergency Release 

The storage compartment in the center console can be released by means of a pull cable in the event of the battery discharging or being 
defective. For this purpose, the cover must be removed from the rear compartment air outlet, followed by removal of the air outlet. 

The storage compartment can then be released by pulling the loop of the pull cable. The central locking system has been adapted to the 
specific requirements of the Convertible. 

The glove compartment and the storage space in the center console have been integrated in the central locking system. The previous 
central locking functions remain unchanged.

Anti-theft Alarm System 

The anti-theft alarm system in the E93 Convertible is identical to that in the 3 Series Sedan in terms of its basic functions and operating 
mode. There are differences in the interior monitoring function and connection to the system network. Microwave sensors, as in the E64 
Convertible, are used for the interior monitoring system instead of ultrasonic sensors. 

The microwave sensors facilitate monitoring of the vehicle interior also when the convertible top is down. The microwave sensors have a 
semicircular radiation characteristic. By strategic placement in the vehicle, the entire interior can be monitored without the microwave 
sensors radiating outside the vehicle. 

Four microwave sensors are used on the E93 Convertible for the purpose of monitoring the interior. The microwave sensors are connect¬ 
ed via the DWA bus to the SINE (siren with tilt alarm sensor). The DWA bus is a sub-bus based on the K-bus. SINE is the master control 
unit and is connected directly to the K-CAN. The entire control of the anti-theft alarm system is located in the SINE.

Power Seats with Easy Entry Function 

Special seats with a seat-integrated seat belt system as in the 
E46/E64 are installed in the E93 Convertible. The electrically 
adjustable seats (comfort and sport) are equipped with a an 
easy-entry function to facilitate entry in the rear compartment. 


For this purpose, an adjustment 
switch is provided on the upper 
end of the backrest in order to 
move the seat fore and aft at 
double the speed via the seat 
forward/backward adjustment 
function. 

When entering the rear seat 
compartment, the customer can 
move the seat forward with the 
adjustment switch. By mechan¬ 
ically releasing the seat back¬ 
rest, it can be additionally tilted 
forward to create sufficient 
space for convenient entry. 

At the same time, the headrest 
is retracted so that the backrest 
can be completely folded down 
and does not come in contact 
with the sun visor. Retraction of 
the headrest depends on the 
position of the seat.

Explanation 

1 

Switch for rear compartment

2 

Backrest release lever 


The headrest is not retracted if the seat position is set in the area 
approximately 8-10 cm from the rear end stop as there is sufficient 
space to fully fold down the backrest in this position. 

Following entry, the backrest is folded back, the headrest is then 
automatically returned to its previous position and the seat can be 
moved back using the adjustment switch. 


The position of the headrest is detected by a Hall sensor on the 
headrest adjustment motor. The seat moves back and assumes 
the previous position. 

The previous position is also determined by means of a Hall sensor 
on the seat forward/backward adjustment motor. The signals from 
the Hall sensors are read into the driver or passenger seat module 
and correspondingly evaluated. The front passenger seat module 
has no memory function. 

A new feature of the seat in the Convertible is the integration of the 
side airbag in the backrest. The use of the seat with integrated 
seat belt system (SGS) makes it necessary to monitor the backrest 
lock. If the backrest were not locked correctly, there would be the 
danger of the occupant moving forward with the backrest without 
any restraint effect. This would be equivalent to the occupant not 
wearing a seat belt. 

For this reason, the back rests on the driver and front passenger 
seats are monitored to ensure they are locked correctly. 

The driver/passenger seat modules monitor the position with Hall 
sensors in the backrest. The information is sent to the crash safety 
module via the K-CAN link. The information is used in the calcula¬ 
tion of the triggering algorithm. 

A backrest that is not locked correctly would have the same effect 
on the triggering characteristics as an occupant not wearing a seat 
belt. 

If the back rests are not locked correctly, the driver/passenger seat 
module generates check control messages which are sent via the 
K-CAN to the instrument cluster and the central information 
display.

Changes to Control Modules 

Various changes have been made to the control units in order to 
incorporate functions specific to the Convertible. Brief descriptions 
of the changes are provided in the following. 

Roof Functions Module (FZD) 

The roof functions module has been adapted in terms of its 
functionality and geometric form to the specific requirements of the 
E93 Convertible. 

The following functions have been adopted: 

• Interior lights, reading light and top light 

• Connection of the electro-chromic interior rear/view 
mirror and transmission of values on the K-CAN 

• Connection of rain/lights sensor via LIN 

• Gateway function LIN > K-CAN 

• Connection of the condensation sensor and 
transmission on the K-CAN 

• Emergency call button 

• Passenger airbag OFF light 

The following functions have been dropped: 

• Connection of interior lights at rear 

• Ultrasonic interior movement detector 

• Operation and actuation of slide/tilt sunroof 

• Microphones for hands-free and voice input On the E93 
Convertible, the microphones for hands-free and voice input 
are located on the steering column trim panel. 



FZD location on E93 



Location of microphones for phone and voice input 










Junction Box 

The functions of the junction box have been included to drive the 
actuators for the glove compartment and storage compartment in 
the center console. 

The gateway function has been adapted to accommodate the D- 
CAN. At present, all other models are still equipped with the previ¬ 
ous diagnosis interface (K-LINE 115 k-bits). 



Footwell Module 

As the master control unit for the power windows, the footwell 
module is responsible for evaluation of the central power window 
switch. The central power window switch in the Convertible makes 
it possible to open and close all four side windows simultaneously. 

A further function is the extended travel range of the power win¬ 
dows as on the E46/E64 Convertible. The extended travel range 
function of the power windows is activated when the retractable 
hardtop is lowered. All side windows are lowered almost fully dur¬ 
ing this operation to ensure smooth opening. 


Car Access System (CAS3) 

The comfort functions of the retractable hardtop have been added 
to the car access system. 

Power Windows 

The E93 Convertible is equipped as standard with power windows 
at the front and rear. In addition to the individual power window 
buttons, the switch cluster on the driver's side contains a central 
button (1), with which all windows can be lowered simultaneously. 

As a standard feature on BMW Convertibles, the side windows are 
frame-less. The windows must enter the door seal by several 
millimeters in order to avoid leaks and wind noise. 

The door windows must be lowered by approximately 15 mm to 
ensure the doors can be opened and closed without applying any 
effort.

Information and Communication Technology 

Several changes have been made to the Drive in connection with 
the launch of the E93 Convertible as from 03/07. In addition to the 
visual changes to the user interface in the form of different fonts 
and colors the operating philosophy of the Setup menu has been 
correspondingly adapted. Eight “favorites” buttons have been 
included for convenience in operation. 

Corresponding software adaptations have also been implemented. 
Some of the new features are dependent on the optional equip¬ 
ment configuration, e.g. menu for light settings. 

Changes in the Setup Menu 

The individual user settings can be selected in the Setup menu. 

As on the other models with CCC as from 09/2006, an additional 
menu bar has been included in the Setup menu. 

The following menu items can be selected in the menu bar: 

• Screen OFF 

• Information sources 

• Settings 

Further settings are linked to each menu item. The available menu 
items depend on the equipment configuration. A new pairing 
assistant for linking the Bluetooth® telephone to the vehicle is pro¬ 
vided under the Bluetooth® menu item. 


Favorites Button for CCC / MASK 

Eight additional favorites button have been added to the two 
options navigation system Business with MASK and navigation 
system Professional CCC. 

The following functions can be stored under the favorites buttons 
for quick access: 

• Radio stations 

• Navigation destinations 

• Stored telephone numbers/names 

• CD/DVD player 

• CD changer 

• MP3 

Note: The freely selectable favorites buttons in the 

multifunction steering wheel are assigned as before. 

The eight favorite buttons are accommodated in the front panel 
under the upper CD/DVD player. The buttons can be assigned 
with functions from the entertainment, telephone and navigation 
menus. 

Six buttons are freely programmable for CCC and two buttons are 
assigned to FM/AM and MODE. 

In addition to the pressure sensor element, the buttons contain a 
capacitive sensor that shows the assignment status of the button 
when touched in the info bar of the central information display. 

A button is simply pressed for longer than 2 seconds to assign a 
function to it.

Antenna Systems 

Since the standard locations for antennas on the roof or in the fixed 
rear window are not available on the E93 Convertible, the various 
antenna systems are distributed and integrated in the vehicle. 
Antennas are required for the following systems: 

• Radio 

• Digital receivers 

• Navigation 

• Telephone and telematics 

• Remote control 

With the exception of the SDARS antenna, the E93 Convertible has 
no visible antennas. The Convertible does not even have the 
standard rod antenna, a feature contributing to the harmonious 
appearance of the exterior. 

AM/FM Antennas 

Four FM antennas (FM1-FM4) and one AM antenna that are 
switched via an FM antenna diversity function are used for radio 
reception in the E93 Convertible. 

Different antennas are used when the hardtop is closed or lowered. 
When closed, the AM, FMIand FM3 antennas in the rear window 
are used as in a Coupe. The antenna amplifier and the rejector 
circuit for the rear window defogger are located on the left C-pillar. 
There is only a rejector circuit on the right-hand C-pillar. 

The E93 Convertible has many information and communication 
antennas all of which, except for one, are concealed. Only the 
SDARS antenna is located on the rear lid as this requires a direct 
reception path to the satellites. 

The antenna systems are divided into radio, digital receiver, tele¬ 
phone, navigation and remote control.

The E93 Convertible features a four FM antenna diversity module 
that is made up of the following antennas: 

• FM1 and FM3 antenna in the rear window 

• FM1 and FM3 antenna in the side trim panel 

• FM2 and FM4 antenna in the rear bumper 

• Antenna amplifier on the C-pillar 

• Antenna amplifier on the left and right shoulder 

• Antenna amplifier in diversity module. 

The switchover between the antennas in the rear window and side 
trim panels takes place by means of a signal from the Convertible 
top module CTM. 

The sequence of FM antenna diversity is not defined as on 
previous models. On the E93, the reception quality and field 
strength of all antennas are checked and stored in a memory. 

The next best FM antenna in the list is selected if the signal quality 
of the radio station received at the active antenna is insufficient in 
terms of quality and field strength. The antennas are evaluated and 
the list updated at the same time as the switchover between the 
individual antennas. 

Changeover takes place in such a way that no interruption is heard. 
The high frequency signal (RF) of the active FM antenna is routed 
from the antenna diversity module via a coaxial cable to the tuner 
for the radio or navigation system. The signal is demodulated in 
the tuner and output via the speakers as an audio signal. 

The radio or navigation system detects whether a diversity module 
is installed and generates the changeover voltage “Us” necessary 
for diversity operation and the intermediate frequency signal (IF). 


The IF is evaluated by the electronic circuitry in the diversity 
module and is a copy of the radio station currently heard on the 
fixed frequency of 10.7 MHz. 

The changeover between AM/FM1 reception and diagnosis mode 
takes place with the aid of the changeover voltage “Us”. 

This voltage is generated by the radio and used in the diversity 
module for evaluation purposes. 

Diversity mode is active at “Us” = 2.5 Volts. AM mode is active or 
the FM1 antenna selected at “Us” = 0 Volts. Diagnosis mode is 
active at “Us” = 5 Volts. 

Up to three signals can be transmitted simultaneously on the 
coaxial cable: 

• RF signal (e.g. 87.5 - 108 MHz) from diversity module to radio 

• Control voltage “Us” from radio to diversity module 

• Intermediate frequency (IF = 10.7 MHz) from radio to diversity 
module as basis for assessing the quality of the RF signal. 

Mutual influencing is not possible due to the different frequencies. 
The frequency is 87.5-108 MHz.

Antenna Diagnosis 

The antenna diagnosis procedure on the E93 is the same as that 
on the BMW3 Series (E90, E91, E92). Self-diagnosis of the diver¬ 
sity module is initiated in the diagnosis module of the BMW diag¬ 
nosis system. This procedure must be carried out with the hardtop 
up and down in order to check all antennas. 

The self-diagnosis includes a check of the antenna inputs based 
on DC measurement. If this check returns a positive result, each 
individual FM antenna is switched on one after the other and the 
field strength assessed (antenna scan). 

AM reception can be checked with the AM amplifier switched on 
and off in the LW, MW and SW ranges. The diagnosis system eval¬ 
uates the measurements and deduces a diagnostic result if the 
self-diagnosis of the diversity module is positive. 

This procedure can also be performed manually through service 
mode of the CCC and M-ASK. The signal quality and field strength 
of the station currently tuned in can be indicated in service mode. 

Service mode is accessed as follows: 

• Select start menu 

• Press and hold controller for at least 10 s 

• Turn controller 3 notches to the right 

• Turn controller 3 notches to the left 

• Turn controller 1 notch to the right 

• Turn controller 1 notch to the left 


Low values relating to the signal quality and field strength may indi¬ 
cate damaged antennas or no terminal Rad_ON. Terminal Rad_ON 
supplies the antenna amplifier and diversity module with voltage.

Antennas for Digital Receivers 

The SDARS system has the only externally visible antenna on the 
E93. The “shark fin” style antenna is mounted on the trunk lid on 
those vehicles which have the optional satellite radio. 

The IBOC system uses the FM antennas for digital reception. 



Antennas for Telephone and Telematic 

The following antennas are required for telephone and telematics 
functions: 

• Telephone antenna 

• Telematics antenna 

• SOS antenna 

• GPS antenna 

• Bluetooth® antenna for internal communication 


Telephone Antenna 

The telephone antenna is 
located under the side panel 
on the front left. This position 
is possible as the side panels 
on the E93 Convertible are 
made of plastic. 

The telephone antenna is 
routed directly to the eject 
box in the center console. 


Telematics Antenna 

The telematics antenna (1) is 
located on the rear bumper 
under the left tail light. 

On vehicles equipped with the 
optional Bluetooth®/Assist 
package, the telematics anten¬ 
na is connected directly to the 
telematics control unitTCU 
and is used solely for data 
transmission relating to 
telematics functions. 













SOS Antenna 

The SOS antenna (2) is 
activated if the emergency call 
function is no longer possible 
via the telematics antenna 
after an accident. 

The SOS antenna is installed 
under the side trim panel on 
the rear left. 



Bluetooth® Antenna 

The Bluetooth® antenna (1) 
is used for internal data trans¬ 
mission between the mobile 
phone and vehicle. 

The Bluetooth® antenna is 
located in the leftfootwell trim

MASK/CCC navigation system, the GPS antenna is routed directly 
to the navigation computer. The TCU receives the position data via 
the MOST. 

The GPS antenna is connected directly to the TCU on vehicles 
with no navigation system but with radio Professional and telemat¬ 
ics functions. In this case, the TCU determines the location. 

The GPS antenna is located behind the roof functions module in 
the roof frame.

Passive Safety Systems 

In the same way as the Sedan, the E93 Convertible offers vehicle safety at the highest level for all occupants as well as in all crash situa¬ 
tions. Numerous reinforcements have been implemented in the body for the purpose of conforming to worldwide stipulations relating to a 
uniform body. 

The loads and stresses that occur in the case of a crash are counteracted by a reinforced floor assembly and a reinforced bulkhead with 
high-strength A-pillars. The reinforced floor assembly is required particularly in the area of the front seats in order to direct the forces that 
are exerted in the event of a crash by the seat integrated seat belt systems into the floor assembly. 



The sills were reinforced specifically for the Convertible in order to be able to absorb the forces in the event of a side crash and to direct 
them to the opposite side of the impact. The roof frame in the area of the windshield has been reinforced and forms the rollover protection 
system together with the roll bars integrated in the partition module. 

In the event of a crash, in which the vehicle rolls over, the roll bars extend in milliseconds and, together with the roof frame, form an 
adequate survival space for the occupants. 

The E93 Convertible is equipped with a passive safety system with rollover protection. In the event of a crash, in which the vehicle rolls 
over, the roll bars extend automatically and, together with the windshield frame form an adequate survival space for the occupants. 

The rollover sensor system is integrated in the crash safety module. The actuators are triggered by the ROC control unit. In the event of a 
side crash, an enlarged side airbag located in the backrest protects the thorax and head of the occupants. 



Advanced Crash and Safety Management 

The E93 Convertible is equipped with the second generation 
advanced crash and safety management system (ACSM2). In 
terms of its scope of functions, the ACSM2 is identical to the 
ACSM in the E64 Convertible. 

The ACSM2 differs from the ACSM in that the supplier is different 
and it features additional interfaces for future function expansions. 
The first generation ACSM is supplied by Autoliv while the second 
generation ACSM is supplied by BOSCH. 


A" ft 



A' 


The task of Advanced Crash and Safety Management is to evaluate 
permanently all the sensor signals in order to identify a crash situa¬ 
tion. As a result of the sensor signals and their evaluation, the 
crash safety module identifies the direction of the crash and the 
severity of the impact. 

The crash safety module incorporates a longitudinal acceleration 
sensor and a transverse acceleration sensor. The sensors serve to 
detect and verify front-end, side-on and rear-end crashes. 

In the E93 Convertible the crash safety module has additional sen¬ 
sors for rollover detection. 

Satellites are also integrated in the B-pillars. The satellites each 
consist of a longitudinal acceleration sensor and a transverse 
acceleration sensor. 


Together with the transverse acceleration sensor in the crash safety 
module, the transverse acceleration sensors serve to detect 
side-on crashes. Door pressure sensors are additionally installed in 
the front doors for the purpose of detecting side crashes. 

The acceleration sensors measure the positive acceleration (+) and 
the negative acceleration (- / deceleration) in the X and Y directions. 
The resultant from the X and Y signals is the definitive factor in 
determining the direction of the impact. 

US vehicles have additional up-front sensors for front-end crash 
detection. 

Also included is information on the occupants and whether they 
have their seat belts fastened or not. From this information, meas¬ 
ures are taken to selectively trigger the necessary restraint systems. 

In order to ensure ACSM operational availability at all times, the 
system monitors itself and indicates that it is ready for operation 
when the airbag warning lamp (AWL) goes out. 

If a fault occurs during operation, this is stored in a fault memory, 
which can then be read out for diagnostic purposes. 

In the event of a crash, this is communicated to the other users in 
the bus-system network by way of a bus telegram. The relevant 
control units respond to this telegram by executing their own 
activities. 

These activities include: 

• Opening the central-locking system 

• Activating the hazard warning flashers 

• Switching on the interior lights 

• Deactivating the fuel pump 

• Switching off the alternator 

• Automatic emergency call.

System Components 

Advanced crash and safety management in the E93 Convertible 
essentially comprises the following components: 

• Crash safety module ACSM2 

• ROC control unit 

• Sensors and switches 

- Up-front sensors 

- Door pressure sensors 

- B-pillar satellites 

- Seat occupancy mat US (OC3) 

- Seat belt buckle switch

diecast housing with integrated plug cover. 



The crash safety module contains two acceleration sensors offset 
at an angle of 90°. These acceleration sensors measure the 
longitudinal acceleration and transverse acceleration of the vehicle. 

A rotation rate sensor as well as a Low-g sensor for transverse 
acceleration (Y-direction) and a Low-g sensor for Z-direction are 
additionally integrated for detecting rollover situations.

ROC Control Unit 

In the E93 Convertible, advanced crash and safety management is 
equipped with an additional ROC control unit (rollover controller). 
The ROC control unit is connected via a K-bus to the crash safety 
module. 

The task of the ROC control unit is to activate the actuators of the 
rollover protection system in the event of an imminent rollover 
situation. 


Airbag Systems 

In addition to the known two-stage driver's and passenger's airbag, 
newly designed side airbags are used in the E93. The side airbags 
are integrated in the backrest of the SGS seat. The side airbags 
have a larger volume compared to the airbags previously used. 

The side airbag develops between the seat and door in the event 
of side impact of sufficient severity. Due to the increased volume, 
the occupant's thorax and head are additionally protected. 


Rollover detection takes place in the crash safety module. Two 
telegrams are sent to the ROC control unit when the threshold 
values are reached. 


The ROC control unit (1) is mounted on the carrier structure of the 
rollover protection systems behind the rear right seat. 



Design features of the E93 Convertible include the pronounced 
inclination of the windshield with the windshield cowl panel extend¬ 
ing further towards the rear. Knee airbags are additionally 
fitted to conform to US legal requirements for protecting occupants 
not wearing seat belts. 

The knee airbags substantially reduce displacement of the pelvis 
and initiate upper body rotation earlier in the event of an accident, 
thus preventing occupant contact with the sun visor on the 
windshield cowl panel. When the ACSM2 detects that the front 
passenger seat is not occupied, the knee airbag on the passen¬ 
ger's side will not be triggered in the event of a crash. 



















Rollover Protection System 

The rollover protection system is of vital importance to the passive 
safety of the E93 Convertible. The rollover protection system helps 
to maintain a sufficient survival space for the occupants in the 
event of the car overturning or rolling over. 



There are different factors which can cause a car to overturn or 
rollover. The most common causes are: 

• The car hits a ramp (e.g. a crash barrier) on one side. The car 
rotates about its longitudinal axis as a result of the high angular 
velocity. 

• The car skids sideways off the road surface and buries itself 
with its wheels in the soft soil. The kinetic energy could be 
sufficient to upend and overturn the car. 

• The car skids sideways off the road into the curb and is 
upended. 

The crucial factors which determine whether the car overturns are 
not just the angle but also the angular velocity at which the car is 
set into the roll. All these vehicle movements can also occur after a 
front-end, side-on or rear-end crash. 

The rollover protection system consists of two extendable rollbars 
which are housed in the partition module behind the two rear seats. 


Rollover Detection 

The E93 Convertible has a special sensor system in the crash 
and safety module ACSM2 for the purpose of detecting rollover 
situations. In addition of the two sensors (4) for longitudinal (X-axis) 
and transverse acceleration (Y-axis), there is a rotation rate sensor 
(2) and a Low-g sensor (3) for the Z-axis and for the Y-axis. 


The longitudinal and transverse acceleration sensors (4) register 
the positive and negative vehicle acceleration in a range from 
0-100 g. They serve to detect heavy accelerations and decelera¬ 
tions in a crash.

The two Low-g sensors (3) have a small measuring range of 0-2 g 
and can therefore detect small accelerations and decelerations with 
great accuracy. For example, when the vehicle skids sideways off 
the road surface and buries itself with its wheels in soft ground. 

The sensors provide a voltage as measured variable. This voltage 
is a measure for the acceleration and is converted directly into 
digital signals in the sensor. The digital values are sent to the 
processor for evaluation. 

The processor evaluates the signals from the longitudinal and 
transverse acceleration sensors and the two Low-g sensors. 

The rotation rate sensor is also included in the calculation. 

The results are compared with the stored algorithm. When 
the processor detects that a rollover is imminent, it sends two 
telegrams within a defined timeframe to the ROC control unit 
with the instruction to trigger the actuators. 

Triggering the Rollbars 

The ROC control unit is supplied with load current via terminal 30. 
Terminal R ON is applied as the switching signal and enables the 
power circuit-breaker (7). In this way, the voltage regulator (8), the 
microprocessor (10) and the switching controller (4) are supplied 
with voltage. The switching controller transforms the voltage into 
35 V and charges up the two firing capacitors (3). 

When the processor in the crash safety module detects an immi¬ 
nent rollover, it sends two telegrams within a defined time window 
via the K-bus. 

The first telegram instructs the ROC control unit to make itself 
ready for firing (arming telegram). The ROC control unit incorpo¬ 
rates two firing capacitors (3) connected in parallel for providing the 
firing energy. Each actuator has one high-side and one low-side 
power circuit-breaker. 


The second telegram contains the firing command (firing telegram). 
The low-side power circuit-breakers (6) are connected to ground 
and the two high-side power circuit breakers (2) are switched 
through. The ROC control unit now discharges the two firing 
capacitors and the two actuators are supplied with voltage. 

During normal operation, the rollbars are inserted in the cassettes 
in the partition module. They are pre-tensioned in the direction of 
their extension by a spring and held in place by a lock on the actua¬ 
tor. 

The ROC control unit activates the two actuators via the output 
stages. Each actuator consists of a single-acting solenoid with 
a lock for disengaging and engaging its rollbar. The solenoid 
actuates the lock and releases the spring-loaded rollbar.

The locking pawls on the rollbar press the toothed rack back 
mechanically as the bar extends. When the protection bar is 
extended, the locking pawls are supported on the tooth strip. 

When the car is in the overturned position, the force is transmitted 
via the locking pawls on the rollbars to the toothed rack. 

The rollover protection system may be triggered as follows: 

• Automatically when an imminent rollover situation is detected 

• By a defined crash severity in a front-end, side-on or rear-end 
crash 

• Via the diagnostic interface 

• By a mechanical emergency release mechanism. 

In order to return the triggered rollbar back into its initial position, it 
is necessary to press the toothed strap back so that the bar can be 
pushed in. 

Triggering the RPS via Diagnosis 

To check the function of the rollover protection system, it is neces¬ 
sary to trigger the system using diagnostic eguipment. 

The output stages of the actuators are activated here with the aid 
of a test module. 

Note: It is absolutely essential to observe the following 
safety precautions: 

• Open the hardtop otherwise the rear window will 
be damaged 

• Make sure no-one is situated in the immediate 
vicinity of the rollbars. 


Mechanical Emergency Release 

The rollover protection system should be triggered if it has to be 
removed for repair work. If this cannot be done electrically, e.g. for 
repair work following an accident, the system must be triggered 
mechanically in order to avoid the risk of injury. 

Follow the procedure set out below: 

• Open the hardtop otherwise the rear window will be damaged 

• Remove rear seat 

• Remove partition panel 

• Remove control units under the rollbar cassette 

• Remove control unit carrier 

• Use a hook (3 mm diameter) to reach the actuator 

• The actuator has an opening in the middle, by means of 
which the rollbar can be triggered using the hook.

Automatic Climate Control 

The E93 Convertible is available with the IHKA system as standard 
equipment. This IHKA system functions much the same way as 
the E92. However, some additional functions have been added to 
enhance AC operation in the convertible environment. 



Due to the RHT, the E93 functions as two vehicles in one - a 
coupe and an open top convertible. In the past, using the AC with 
the top down creates a less than optimal situation for the driver. 

When the top is down, outside temperature variations and changes 
in solar radiation can now influence the IHKA system with less than 
accurate information. Also, the “ram air pressure compensation” 
feature in BMW IHKA systems is not desirable when the top is 
down. 


4 H Automatic programs ► 

□ soft 
medium 
D intensive 
Convertible 

A Radio mode switched on 


This mode requires no additional components or sensors. Only 
the “top down” signal from the CTM is required. 

On vehicles with CCC (CID), the convertible top mode can be 
selected and disabled. On vehicles without CCC, the convertible 
top mode is always active when the top is down. 

The parameters for controlling the ventilation are based on the 
sun's intensity, driving speed and outside temperature. This 
program ensures optimum heating/ventilation comfort for the 
occupants. 



This situation forces the driver to continually adjust the temperature 
and blower controls for maximum comfort. So, a “convertible top 
mode” has been introduced into the E93. 


This mode is activated when the top is down. A signal from the 
convertible top module to the IHKA provides the activation for the 
convertible top mode. 




Convertible Mode Control 

The aim of Convertible mode is to create an automatic program 
that renders manual intervention by the driver or passenger unnec¬ 
essary. 

When driving with the top down, the occupants consciously 
expose themselves to the solar radiation and outside temperature 
at changing driving speeds. These parameters have a decisive 
influence on the climate in the vehicle interior and must therefore 
be taken into consideration in the control concept. 

The spatial separation of the interior is cancelled when the hardtop 
is opened thus drastically reducing the influence of the interior 
temperature sensor. The temperature control for the vent outlet 
temperature is strongly orientated on the outside temperature. 

The sun's intensity has a great influence on the climate in the 
vehicle interior when driving with the top down. Therefore, changes 
in conditions such as cloudless, cloudy or daytime/night-time are 
included via the solar sensor to a greater extent in the temperature 
control than when the hardtop is up. 

Unlike when the vehicle is closed, the ventilation outlets become 
the dominant air distribution level when the hardtop is down and 
are therefore always fully opened while, to achieve a comfort 
balance, the footwell outlets must always be restricted as soon as 
the operating temperature of the engine necessary for heating is 
reached. 

Measures for keeping the windshield/windows clear are not neces¬ 
sary when driving with the top down, therefore the defrost outlets 
always remain closed. 

The driver sets the required temperature at the temperature 
control. Depending on the outside temperature, sun's intensity 
and vehicle speed, the required interior climate is maintained by the 
supply of correspondingly temperature-controlled air. 


The most comfortable conditions are achieved with the side win¬ 
dows closed and a wind deflector additionally installed. 

The ram pressure compensation that serves the purpose of keep¬ 
ing the air throughput constant when the vehicle is closed is 
cancelled in Convertible mode. The blower output is additionally 
increased based on the vehicle speed in order to maintain a 
constant airflow about the occupants. 

The increasing air volume essentially shields the occupants from 
increasing turbulence at higher vehicle speeds. The occupants 
subjectively notice no difference in temperature conditions. 

The AUC function is also active in Convertible mode up to a speed 
of 45 mph (70 km/h). It is deactivated at higher speeds. This is 
intended to ensure that no pollutants are blown into the interior of 
the vehicle via the air conditioning outlets when driving at low 
speeds, e.g. in urban or stop-and-go traffic. The best effect is 
achieved with the side windows closed. 

Note: If Convertible mode is not activated, the selected 
automatic program (soft, medium, intensive) is 
activated when the hardtop is opened. All other 
program settings are deactivated (grey) if the 
Convertible mode is activated with the hardtop 
lowered. The other program settings can be selected 
if Convertible mode is not activated with the hardtop 
lowered.

Retractable Hard Top (RHT) 



For 2007, the new 3-series convertible has a retractable hard top 
featuring all steel panels. Advantages of the steel panel design 
include: 

• Improved protection against vandalism and theft 

• Better sound insulation than the former cloth top 

• Optimized year-round suitability 

• Eliminates the cost of an additional hard-top 

• Improved resale value 

• “Coupe-like” appearance when top is up 

• Large glass rear window allows more visibility 


E93 RHT Features: 

• All steel construction including trunk lid 

• Hydraulic operation featuring 8 hydraulic rams 

• 6 Gas pressurized dampers to provide smooth movement 

• High pressure hydraulic pump below luggage compartment 
floor 

• Remote operation (with Comfort Access) 

• Complete opening/closing operation in less than 25 seconds 

• Soft-close (SCA) trunk operation 


















Hard Top Operation 



The RHT consists of three steel panels which fold up into a roof 
“package”. This roof package can then be stowed into a space 
designated in the trunk. 

The steel roof panels continue to use the interior headliner as used 
on past convertibles. The liners give the interior a finished appear¬ 
ance and also contribute to noise reduction. 

Some of the things to be considered are that the roof panels must 
also be secured into the trunk to avoid damage and unwanted 
noise. The details of the hydraulics and mechanical operation will 
be covered on subsequent pages in this workbook 

The mechanical and hydraulic elements in the RHT are designed 
to achieve to necessary goals of fast, smooth and quiet operation. 



The convertible top switch is 
in the center console. 


The top can be operated via the switch in the center console, the 
mechanical portion of the key and via remote operation. Remote 
operation is carried out via the remote control (I.D. transmitter). 
This feature is only possible with comfort access. 


It is directly connected to the 
CTM and provides a ground 
input for top operation. 

The switch has red and green 
LED’s to indicate top status. 



The remote control/ID 
transmitter is capable of 
providing remote operation 
only in conjunction with 
Comfort Access. 

The mechanical key can 
operate the top when inserted 
into the driver’s door lock.

Switch Operation 

The RHT is operated by a switch in the center console. The switch 
provides a ground input to the CTM for top operation. 

The movement of the hard top is carried out as long as the switch 
is actuated. 

The switch contains two LED’s which indicate the status of the top. 
The green LED is illuminated (solid) when the top is moving and 
will go out only when the top operation is complete. 

The red LED will flash when the switch is released before the top 
has completed the full opening or closing operation. If the top 
operation is interrupted, operation can be resumed by pressing the 
switch until complete (Green LED off). 

When the red LED is on continuously (solid), the top is not capable 
of operating. This could be due to a malfunction or one of the pre¬ 
conditions is not met. For example, if the luggage compartment 
divider not in the fully down position, the red LED will be on contin¬ 
uously as an indication. 

When the top is prevented from operation, there will be a check 
control message (with CCC), an icon and a gong. This will let the 
driver know that there is a condition which is preventing top 
operation.

Note: The switch on early production vehicles operates 
differently than that of later production vehicles. 


The early version requires the switch to be pressed in 
order to close the top. The top is opened by pulling 
the switch up. 


On later production models, the operates in the 
exact opposite. 








Workshop Exercise- Sequence of operation 


Using the actual vehicle as a guide, operate the top through the opening and closing operations. Note the sequence and 
complete the exercise below by numbering the illustrations below in the correct order starting with the top open. 



Operate the RHT using the center console switch and note the status of the LED’s in the switch. Interrupt the RHT during opera¬ 
tion to see how the LED’s are affected. 

Next, attempt to operate the RHT with one or more of the preconditions in the incorrect state (i.e. luggage compartment divider up 
or trunk open etc.) The note the CC messages and icons which appear. 

What type of sensor/switch senses the position of the luggage compartment divider? 


If the vehicle does not have CCC, how is the driver warned of improper operation?

Convenience Operation 

Other than the switch in the center console, the RHT can be 
operated via convenience functions. These functions include: 

• Via the remote control/ID sensor (with Comfort Access only) 

• Via the door lock with the mechanical key (open/close) 



By holding the unlock button, the 
RHT can be fully opened. 

The windows will also be lowered by 
continued pressing of the switch. 

(This feature will only work with 
Comfort Access) 


By holding the lock button, the RHT 
can be fully closed. 

The windows will also be raised by 
continued pressing of the switch. 

(This feature will only work with 
Comfort Access) 



The RHT can also be operated by the 
mechanical key when inserted into 
the driver’s door lock cylinder. 

The top can be opened by holding 
the key in the “unlock” direction and 
closed by holding in the “lock” 
direction. 


TEflVMa? 





Convenience Loading and Unloading 

When the RHT is open and there is a need for access to the 
luggage compartment, a convenience loading/unloading feature 
has been added. This allows guick access to the luggage 
compartment without completely closing the hard top. 

As with the other convenience features, this is only available with 
Comfort Access. Also this feature can only be activated via the 
remote control/ID sensor. 

This feature is activated as follows: 

• Briefly press the trunk release button (on the remote) 

• Then, press and hold down the trunk release button (no more 
than one second can pass between the two activations of the 
trunk release button). 

The operation will start by opening the rear module all the way. 

The roof package will be lifted to the intermediate position. 

Then, the rear module is closed and locked. Finally, the trunk lid 
will be released using the SCA and slightly opened. 

Now, the luggage compartment divider can re raised and luggage 
can be loaded (or unloaded) without the need to completely close 
the hard top. 

Once the luggage loading (or unloading) process is complete, the 
top can be re-opened by pressing the unlock button on the 
remote. The top will open again completely. 




The convenience loading fea¬ 
ture is initiated by pressing the 
trunk release button twice (one 
quick press followed by holding 
the button until the process is 
done). 



The convenience loading fea¬ 
ture is completed by pressing 
the unlock button (and holding) 
to re-open the hard top.

Soft Close Automatic (SCA) 

For convenient closing of the boot lid, the Soft Close Automatic is installed as standard. It consists of two Soft Close Automatic drives 
that lock the boot lid to the rear module carrier on the left and right. This increases the stability of the boot area. 

Opening the Boot Lid 

When the boot lid is opened using the boot lid button, a microswitch is actuated and its status is read by the junction box JB. The JB 
sends a message to the CAS via K-CAN. After the check is successfully completed, the CAS sends the release and the JB triggers the 
drive for unlocking the boot lid. The drive actuates the release catch; the left and right boot lid locks are unlocked via the control cables. 

The JB transmits the status of the boot lid (unlocked) on K-CAN, and the CTM receives it. The CTM then triggers the start-up of the 
SCA drives, which then move to standby position and are available for a closing operation or to support a closing operation. 

Closing the Boot Lid 

When the boot lid is closed, the SCA drives are in standby position. When the left and right boot lid locks have reached the locking clips, 
two microswitches are actuated and their status is read in by the CTM. The CTM then triggers both SCA drives (one on each SCA drive) 
until two other microswitches signal the "boot lid locked" status to the CTM. 

Manually closing the boot lid would make closing via the Soft Close Automatic drive unnecessary. However, because it must be ensured 
that the boot lid is really closed, the Soft Close Automatic drive is actuated nonetheless. The end position of the SCA drives in the 
"Unlocked" status is signalled to the CTM by two additional microswitches. 

Non-repeat Lock 

Each Soft Close Automatic drive has a “non-repeat” lock to prevent overheating of the Soft Close Automatic drive. It allows up to 20 
actuations (counter up to 20 increments) of the Soft Close Automatic drive. Afterwards, the Soft Close Automatic drive is electrically 
disabled for approximately. 2 minutes.

Mechanical Components 

The RHT is a roof system which consists of a three piece sheet steel design. The roof system withstands speeds up to 167 mph 
(270 km/h) and has a sophisticated water management system for draining remaining water when the roof is extended or retracted. 

Aerials (AM/FM) are integrated into the bonded rear window. The hardtop roof panels (shells) are made of sheet steel in a classic 
“sandwich” construction and are engineered for optimum weight and rigidity. 

A central hydraulic system in the luggage compartment floor provides the hydraulic pressure for movement of 8 hydraulic cylinders 
in the overall system. 

The retractable hard top (RHT) consists of two main (major) sections; the roof module and the rear module.

Roof Module 

The roof module consists of 3 roof panels, linkage, main mount and the hydraulics. The movement sequence of the retractable hardtop is 
driven by a central hydraulic system with hydraulic 8-cylinder activation, with an additional 2 gas pressure dampers in the main mount. 

A total of 8 hydraulic cylinders and 6 gas pressure dampers are used in the retractable hardtop. The hydraulic system is controlled via the 
Convertible top module (CTM) and is built into a multifunctional tray in the luggage compartment floor. 

A central electric motor in the front roof panel serves to lock the entire retractable hardtop system. The roof shells are interlocked using 
drive cable tubes, similar to a sunroof drive. The roof module weighs about 215 lbs (approximately 95 lbs. more than a soft top)

Water Management 

The water flows from the roof channel into a water drain through a duct system with valve on the main guide bar. When the retractable 
hardtop is stowed while wet, any remaining water droplets are collected in the side storage trays and the channel in the boot sill panel, 
where they can evaporate. This provides items of luggage with maximum protection from remaining water.

Drive for Hardtop Locking 

The roof panels of the hardtop are interlocked. In addition, the front roof panel is locked at the cowl panel via two catch hooks.

Locking Sequence 

When the front roof shell has reached the cowl panel, the electric 
motor is activated. 

The left and right drive cables are driven via the gearwheel on the 
electric motor (in a manner similar to the sliding/tilt sunroof). 



By means of these elements and flexible rods, the force is transmit¬ 
ted to the locking bolts of roof panels 2 and 3. 

While the drive cables are being driven, the connecting rods are 
simultaneously activated via the control disk. The force is transmit¬ 
ted from the gearwheel of the electric motor to the connecting 
rods via the splines on the control disk. 

The left and right connecting rods separate, and the front roof 
panel is locked to the cowl panel via the catch hooks. The locking 
hook, which locks the front roof panel to the center roof panel, is 
also driven via the center connecting rod. 

The roof shells are unlocked in the opposite direction. 

The end positions of the electric motor are detected by two micro¬ 
switches and forwarded to the CTM. 

Locking of the roof shells in the luggage compartment 

To prevent damage to the roof shells when stowed, such as when 
driving over ground contours, potholes, etc., the front roof shell is 
locked in the luggage compartment. Locking the front roof shell 
also prevents noises (such as groaning noise or clatter).

Electrical Components 

Convertible Top Module 

The Convertible top module (CTM) is the central electronic control 
module for all functions of the retractable hardtop. The installation 
location of the CTM is the right divider compartment module. 

The CTM controls the retractable hardtop, the rear module and the 
Soft Close Automatic feature. Power is supplied to the CTM by the 
junction box with terminal 30g. 

There is an additional power supply to the CTM via terminal 15 of 
the Car Access System (CAS) so that in certain cases of 
malfunction, such as an interrupted supply from the junction box, 
adequate diagnostics and communication with the diagnostic 
tester are possible. 

The CTM controls the electric motor for the interlocking of the roof 
shells and of the front roof shell to the cowl panel. In addition, it 
controls the hydraulic pump and the 8 hydraulic cylinders via the 
5 valves in the hydraulic unit. 

During the hardtop and rear module movements, the respective 
position is detected by 9 Hall sensors and 5 microswitches in the 
cowl panel, hardtop and rear module and forwarded to the CTM via 
the respective wiring harness. Each of them signals whether a cer¬ 
tain status has been reached and whether the CTM can initiate the 
next phase. 

The current supply of the microswitches/Hall sensors is provided 
by the CTM. The CTM also reads in the status of the button. 

The CTM is connected to other control units via the K-CAN. 

For example, information about the outside temperature, driving 
speed and status of the boot lid is received via K-CAN. 

When the hardtop is opened or closed, the CTM sends the request 
to lower the side windows to the FRM. 


In certain critical situations, the 
CTM triggers introductions that 
are easily understandable to the 
customer in the instrument cluster 
as check control messages and 
text messages in the CID. 

Depending on whether the roof is 
closed or open, the CTM will 
transmit a signal to the diversity 
aerials to switch from glass 
mounted aerials to the auxiliary 
(bumper/trim mounted) aerials.

Hydraulic Components 

The retractable hardtop and the rear module are driven hydraulically. The hydraulic system consists of 8 hydraulic cylinders that are 
supplied with pressure by the hydraulic system via the hydraulic lines. The cylinders are always activated in pairs. The hydraulic assembly 
is installed in a recess in the luggage compartment floor. Four cylinders are required for the movement of the hardtop: the two roof shell 
cylinders and two rear pillar cylinders. The rear module is opened and closed by two rear module cylinders. Two closure cylinders are 
responsible for locking/unlocking the rear roof panels and the rear module.

Hydraulic Unit 

The movement direction of the hardtop and rear module are determined by corresponding valve positions and by reversing the direction of 
rotation of the pump. The hydraulic pump in the hydraulic unit is driven by an electric motor that operates in two directions of rotation. 

Both rotation directions are implemented with a relay switch. The pump motor and the five hydraulic valves are activated by the CTM. 

The power consumption of the electric motor is about 40 A (safeguarded by a 50 A fuse). The hydraulic pump generates an operating 
pressure of 150 to 200 bar. 

To prevent the pump motor from overheating if the hardtop is operated frequently, the temperature of the pump motor is measured using 
an NTC resistor. The NTC resistor is connected to the CTM via two wires with a floating ground. An open circuit causes an entry in the 
fault code memory, but does not prevent the hardtop from moving. 

Two temperature values are particularly important. The lower of these is around 90°C and serves as an "early warning". If this tempera¬ 
ture is exceeded, any hardtop movement that has already begun is continued until it as safely come to an end. If the temperature reaches 
105°C, the hardtop movement is stopped immediately. It cannot be resumed until the temperature falls back below 90°C.

If the hardtop movement is interrupted, the hardtop remains in the hold position. The pressure in the hydraulic system is maintained at all 
times and is not shut off. In case of an emergency actuation of the hardtop, the bleed screw on the hydraulic pump must be released. The 
hydraulic fluid does not need to be changed (lifetime filling). 

If the hydraulic fluid needs to be refilled due to leaks ensure that the approved hydraulic fluid is used (see Electronic Parts Catalog). 

Add hydraulic fluid only up to the mark on the reservoir. If a lot of noise is heard while the hardtop is actuated, the hardtop must be 
opened and closed a few times in succession to allow the system to bleed. 

The hydraulic system is automatically bled in the reservoir. 

Closure Cylinders 

The closure cylinders (1) lock the rear roof panel and rear module to the body. Before the hardtop can be opened, the rear roof shell must 
be unlocked. It is unlocked by extending the piston. A Hall sensor is installed on the right cylinder that detects the position of the extend¬ 
ed piston. Since the cylinders are de-pressurized if the hydraulic pump is not activated, they are engaged while locked or activated via 
dead center. 

The locking is signalled to the CTM by two microswitches ( one on each of the two closure cylinders). When the hardtop is closed, after 
the roof package is extended and the rear module is closed, the closure cylinders are retracted in order to push the rear module all the way 
into the lower position. Then, the closures open and are not closed until the roof shells are interlocked and locked to the cowl panel. The 
rear roof panel and the rear module are locked to the body by closing the closures.

Roof Panel Cylinders 

The movement of the roof panels is carried out using two roof panel cylinders. The actuation direction of the roof panel cylinders depends 
on the rotation direction of the hydraulic pump. When the pistons have retracted into the roof, the hardtop is closed. When the roof panel 
cylinders are pressurized on the piston side, the pistons are extended and move the roof panels above each other via the roof panel 
control arms. Two Hall sensors are installed on the right roof panel cylinder and detect the position of the piston. 

When the roof panel cylinders are pressurized on the rod side, the pistons are retracted and the roof shells separate. When the Hall 
sensor detects the position of the retracting piston, the pressure in the cylinder is reduced. In addition, the spring on the roof panel 
cylinder acts counter to the movement direction. 

The reason for this is that the front roof panel moves into the front cowl very slowly, resulting in a harmonious hardtop movement. 

The slow movement also minimizes the risk of becoming trapped.

Main Pillar Cylinders 

The main pillar cylinders serve to stow the roof package in the 
luggage compartment and to lift it out of the luggage compartment. 
When the rear pillar cylinders are retracted, the roof package is 
lifted. The roof package is stowed by extending the main pillar 
cylinders. A Hail sensor is installed on the right main pillar cylinder 
that signals the "Roof panels extended" position to the CTM. 

The uniform movement of the roof package is supported by 2 gas 
pressure dampers in the main mount. 


Rear Module Cylinders 

The rear module is opened and closed by the rear module 
cylinders. When the rear pillar cylinders are retracted, the rear 
module is closed. The rear module is opened by extending the 
pistons in the rear module cylinders. 

Two Hall sensors are installed on the right rear module cylinder. 
The upper Hall sensor detects the position of the opened rear 
module. The lower Hall sensor signals to the CTM that the rear 
module is almost closed.
