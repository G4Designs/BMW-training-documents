1. Introduction 


A 

Only Service employees who satisfy all the prerequisites are permitted to work on the designated 
high-voltage components: qualification, compliance with the safety rules, proceed exactly as per repair 
instructions (see also chapter "Prerequisites"). 

The diagnosis and repair of the high-voltage components is only allowed in a retail service 
center that has qualified and certified service technicians. These technicians must have 
completed the ST1403b 101 High Voltage Battery and Maintenance instructor led course and 
successfully passed the hands on certification.

101 High-voltage Components 

2. Important Notes 

The high-voltage components of the 101 have an intrinsically safe design. This means that faults which 
could lead to harming the vehicle user are reliably identified. 


2.1. Identification of the high-voltage components 

Each high-voltage component has on its housing or casing an identifying label that enables Service 
employees and vehicle users to identify intuitively the possible hazards that can result from the high 
electric voltages used.

High-voltage component warning sticker 

The high-voltage cables are a special case for identification. As they may be a few meterslong, 
identification with a warning sticker at one or two places would not make sense. The Service employee 
could easily oversee these stickers. Instead all high-voltage cables are marked in the orange warning 
color. Also the connectors at high-voltage cables, as well as the high-voltage safety connector, are 
marked in orange.

2.2. Safe working practices for working on a high-voltage system 

A 

Before working on high-voltage components of the 101, it is essential to observe and implement the 
electrical safety rules: 

1 The high-voltage system must be disconnected from the supply 

2 The high-voltage system must be provided with a safeguard to prevent unintentional restarting 

3 The safe isolation of the high-voltage system must be verified 


The following chapters provide brief descriptions on how to implement the electrical safety rules in the 
101 . 


2.2.1. Preparations 

Prior to beginning any work, the vehicle must be secured against rolling away (engage the parking lock 
of the transmission and activate the parking brake). Terminal 15 and terminal R must be switched off. 
Disconnect any connected charging cables. The vehicle should be in "rest state". 

2.2.2. Disconnect the high-voltage system from the supply 

The high-voltage system in the 101 is disconnected from the supply with the high-voltage safety 
connector. To disconnect from the supply, the connector must be pulled from the relevant socket. This 
interrupts the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop. 



This image shows the high-voltage safety 
connector in a connected state. The circuit 
of the high-voltage interlock loop is not 
interrupted. 

The message "ON" at the high-voltage safety 
connector indicates an active high-voltage 
system. 


4 








101 High-voltage Components 

2. Important Notes 



In order to be able to separate the connector, 
the mechanical lock (1) has to be pressed. 



As soon as the mechanical lock has been 
removed, the connector can be pulled from the 
socket a few millimeters. 

A 

Do not pull any further or harder if resistance 
can be felt. The high-voltage safety connector 
cannot be disconnected from each other 
completely. 

When the high-voltage safety connector is 
pulled out far enough the message "OFF" is 
visible. The high-voltage system is thus in a de¬ 
energized state. 


2.2.3. Provide the high-voltage system with a safeguard against unintentional 
restarting 

Securing against restart is also effected at the high-voltage safety connector. A commercially available 
U-lock (for example, ABUS 45/40) is required for this purpose. 


5 












101 High-voltage Components 

2. Important Notes 



By separating the high-voltage safety 
connector, a bore hole becomes free through 
both parts. The loop of a typical U-lock must be 
inserted in this bore hole. 



The U-lock can now be closed. The key must 
be stored in a safe place during work on the 
high-voltage system so that an unauthorized 
person cannot unlock the lock. 

The connector can no longer be used by 
inserting and closing the U-lock at the high- 
voltage safety connector. This is an effective 
way of ensuring that the high-voltage system is 
not switched on again without the knowledge 
and consent of the Service employee. 


2.2.4. Verifying safe isolation from the supply 

In BMW Service the de-energized state is not verified using a measuring device or via the diagnosis 
system. Instead, the high-voltage components measure the voltage themselves and transmit the 
measuring result via bus signal to the instrument cluster. 

The instrument cluster does not generate the Check Control message to display the de-energized 
state unless all involved high-voltage components consistently signal the de-energized state. This 
Check Control symbol in red shows a crossed-out flash symbol. The text message "High-voltage 
system switched off" also appears in the instrument cluster.

Explanation 

1 

Check Control symbol for the display of the de-energized state and text 
message "High-voltage system switched off" 


In order to verify the de-energized state, the Service employee must switch on terminal 15 and wait 
until he sees the Check Control message with the symbol and text shown above on the instrument 
cluster. Then, and only then, have you ensured that the high-voltage system is de-energized. After the 
de-energized state has been verified, terminal 15 and terminal R must be switched off again before 
you can start the actual work. 

A_ _ _ _ 

If the Check Control message is not displayed, you must not carry out any work on high-voltage 
components! 


A_ 

Refueling the vehicle while the high-voltage battery is charging is not permitted! 

When the charging cable is inserted do not initiate a refueling procedure and keep a safe distance from 
highly flammable materials. Otherwise, in the event of incorrect connection or removal of the charging 
cable there is a risk of personal injury or material damage by burning fuel for example. 


A ___ 

While the 101 is connected to the AC voltage network for charging, no work may be performed at the 
high-voltage system. 


2.3. Removing and connecting the high-voltage connector 

A certain sequence must be observed when breaking or establishing the contact connection both 
for flat and round high-voltage connectors. The individual steps are described below in the form of 
graphics and texts.

2. Important Notes 

2.3.1. Removing the flat high-voltage connector 



Bridge for high-voltage interlock loop 

Before the high-voltage connector can be 
disconnected, the bridge for the high-voltage 
interlock loop must first be removed. The bridge 
closes the circuit of the high-voltage interlock 
loop in a connected state. The high-voltage 
control units continuously monitor the circuit of 
the high-voltage interlock loop and only when 
the circuit is closed is the high-voltage system 
active. 

If the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop 
is interrupted by removing the bridge, the high- 
voltage system shuts down automatically. This 
is an additional safety precaution as the Service 
employee has already switched off the high- 
voltage system before beginning work. 



Removing the mechanical locking 

Only after the bridge of the high-voltage 
interlock loop has been removed, can the 
mechanical locking be moved in the direction of 
the arrow. The mechanical locking is an element 
of the high-voltage connector on the high- 
voltage components (e.g. electrical machine 
electronics). 

By moving the lock in the direction of the 
arrow the mechanical guide of the high-voltage 
connector on the high-voltage cable is released 
which permits the subsequent disconnection. 


8 





101 High-voltage Components 

2. Important Notes 



Removing the connector of the high-voltage 
cable 

The connector of the high-voltage cable must 
now be removed in the direction of the arrow. 
After the connector has been pulled out a 
few millimeters (A), one encounters a higher 
counterforce. The connector must then be 
pulled out further in the same direction (B). 
Under no circumstances must the connector 
be pressed back into the socket on the high- 
voltage component after reaching position (A). 
This may damage the connector on the high- 
voltage components. 

A 

The high-voltage connector of the high-voltage 
cables must be pulled out at a right angle in two 
steps and in the same direction. Changing the 
direction of movement during removal is not 
permitted. 


Proceed in the reverse order when reattaching the high-voltage cable. The following graphic shows 
the complex design of the high-voltage connector on the high-voltage components and explains why 
one must proceed with care when removing and inserting high-voltage cables.

2.3.2. Removing the round high-voltage connector 

The procedure described here applies for removing the round high-voltage connector in the 101. 
The following graphics show the procedure using the example of the high-voltage connection at the 
electrical machine electronics, at which the high-voltage cable is connected for the electric heating. 


10 






101 High-voltage Components 

2. Important Notes 



The connector of the high-voltage cable (1) is 
located at the high-voltage connection of the 
component (2) and is locked. 



The two locking elements (2) must be pressed 
together in the direction of arrow (1). The 
mechanical lock of the connector at the 
connection of the high-voltage component is 
thus removed. 



While the locking elements are further pushed 
together, the connector must be removed 
lengthways in the direction of arrow (1). 


When reconnecting the high-voltage cable the locking elements must not be pushed together. It is 
sufficient to slide the connector lengthways onto the high-voltage connection of the component. 
Ensure that the locking elements engage ("clicking" noise). In addition, the engaging of the locking 
elements should be checked by subsequent pulling on the connector.

High-voltage connection, pin 1 (DC, plus) 


The bridge in the high-voltage connector serves for electrical safety. The signal of the high-voltage 
interlock loop runs over this bridge when the high-voltage cable is connected to the high-voltage 
component. For the connection of the high-voltage cable to the EKK and to the electric heating the 
voltage supply of the EKK or transmission control unit runs via the bridge. If one of the circuits is 
interrupted, this also results in an automatic interruption to the current flow (returns to zero) in the 
respective high-voltage cable. As the two contacts of the bridge opposite the high-voltage contacts 
advance, this measure constitutes protection against the formation of an electric arc when removing 
the high-voltage connector. 


2.4. Connections for potential compensation lines 

The safety concept of the high-voltage system includes the measurement and monitoring of the 
isolation resistance of the high-voltage cables to each other and against ground. This safety function 
is performed in the 101 of the SME control unit, but should identify isolation faults in the entire high- 
voltage circuit. For this purpose, the housing of all high-voltage components must be connected 
galvanically to ground.

If in the event of a repair the high-voltage components or the potential compensation lines are 
replaced, the following must be observed during assembly: The galvanic connection between the 
housing of the high-voltage components and ground must be properly re-established. The repair 
instructions must be strictly observed (tightening torque, self-cutting screws). In addition, a second 
Service employee has to check the repair work (correct tightening torque and correct location of bare 
metal) and record this in writing in the repair order.

3.1. Electrical machine 

The electrical machine in the 101 receives an electric motor identification, as known from combustion 
engines. This electrical machine identification is IB1P25B. 

3.1.1. Designation and identification of electrical machines 

Designation of electrical machines 

The electrical machine designations are used in the technical documentation for clear identification of 
the electrical machines. 

According to GS 90023, the designation of the electrical machine used in the 101 is: 

EMP242.130.01.250(300)-A3-X1 

In frequent cases, however, only a short designation is used. This short designation is used to assign 
an electrical machine to an electrical machine family. For instance, the short designation EMP242 is 
also used.

The electrical machines have an identification to ensure clear identification and classification. This 
identification is also necessary for approval by government authorities. The identification of the 
electrical machines is equivalent to the identification of the combustion engines. The number of the 
electrical machine can be found under the electrical machine identification on the electrical machine. 
This consecutive number, in conjunction with the identification, permits unambiguous identification of 
each individual electrical machine.

3.1.2. Technical data 

The electrical machine in the 101 is a synchronous machine. Its general structure and operating 
principle correspond to those of a permanently excited synchronous machine with internal rotor: 

The rotor is located inside and is equipped with permanent magnets. The stator is ring-shaped and 
arranged outside around the rotor. It is formed by the 3-phase coils which are housed in the grooves of 
the stator. If a 3-phase AC voltage is applied to the stator coils, they generate a rotating magnetic field, 
which "pulls" the magnets in the rotor (in engine operation).

To improve the technical data the structure, primarily of the rotor, was modified and optimized. The 
rotor has a new arrangement of the permanent magnets and a stack of sheets which has a positive 
influence on the characteristic of the magnetic field lines. On the one hand, this improves the torque. 
On the other hand, there are lower current levels in the stator coils, whereby the efficiency is increased 
in comparison to a conventional synchronous machine.

The maximum power of 125 kW can only be made available for a maximum duration of 30 s. 

Otherwise, the components of the drive train would be damaged through overheating - this affects not 
only the electrical machine, but also the high-voltage battery and the electrical machine electronics. 
The maximum power applies for the motor operation - in theory it could also be used in the alternator

operation during brake energy regeneration. However, in practice only a fractional part of this maximum 
value is used in alternator operation. As a result, the braking torque at the rear axle is restricted so as 
not to affect the driving stability by the brake energy regeneration. 



The power and torque diagram shown here is not the full load diagram. Instead, the data was recorded 
at a lower supply voltage, as it occurs, for example, during a partially charged high-voltage battery. 
Nevertheless, the data of the electrical machine are impressive and do not need to fear comparison 
with the N52B30U1 engine. The following properties are characteristic of the electrical machine 
IB1P25B in the 101:

• The maximum torque of 250 Nm is already available from when the machine is at a standstill 
and is available up to average engine speeds. This is why the drive train of the 101 does not 
need a clutch. Besides this technical feature, there is also another advantage for the customer: 
The 101 has an impressive accelerating ability from standstill, which results in The Ultimate 
Driving Machine typical of BMW, particularly in urban traffic. 

• The maximum torque only decreases again at higher engine speeds. However, it is sufficient 
to be able to dynamically overtake in the speed range on national roads. 

• The characteristic of the maximum power can be deduced from the characteristic of the 
maximum torque: In the engine speed range in which the maximum torque is applied 
constantly the maximum power increases linear to its maximum. Despite the falling torque at 
higher engine speeds, the maximum power only decreases slightly to the maximum engine 
speed. 

• The usable engine speed range of the electrical machine is sufficient from 0 to almost 

11,400 rpm. Owing to this almost double the engine speed range of a combustion engine, the 
101 manages without a manual gearbox and still achieves a remarkable maximum speed of 
150 km/h.

In the graphic only the part of the stator without coil is shown. The rotor consists of a weight-optimized 
support in the inside, a stack of sheets and permanent magnets, which are arranged in two layers. The 
torque that can be generated by the machine is therefore increased. The rotor is shrink-fitted on the 
drive shaft. 

The number of pole pairs of 6 is a good ratio between the justifiable complexity of the design and 
represents a constant torque curve for each revolution where possible. 

The electrical machine of the 101 does not have an oil filling. Only the two grooved ball bearings which 
include a grease filling are lubricated. The cooling of the electrical machine is effected using coolant, 
which is conveyed from the output of the electrical machine electronics to the electrical machine. In 
the electrical machine the coolant flows through a spiral-shaped coolant duct, which runs at the outer 
side. Two O-rings at the housing ends seal the coolant duct. The inside of the electrical machine is 
therefore completely "dry".

The electrical machine is designed for a large temperature range. The coolant can reach a temperature 
of up to 70 °C at the input (supply). And although the electrical machine demonstrates less losses 
during energy conversion than a combustion engine, its housing can absorb a temperature of up to 
100°C. 

A 

Danger of injury: The housing of the electrical machine can absorb temperatures of up to 100 °C 
during operation. A sufficiently long time must be waited for cooling if work is to be performed, for 
example the removal of the drive unit. 


Sensors 

In order to avoid damage to the components due to the high temperature, there are two temperature 
sensors in the electrical machine of the 101. Both temperature sensors are located in the coils 
of the stator. The temperature of the rotor is not measured directly, but can be determined from 
the measured values of the temperature sensors in the stator. The two temperature sensors are 
temperature-dependent resistors of type NTC. Their signals are read in and evaluated analogically by 
the electrical machine electronics. 

So that the voltages for the coils in the stator can be correctly calculated and generated by the 
electrical machine electronics in terms of amplitude and phase layer, the precise angle setting of the 
rotor must be known. This is why there is a rotor position sensor at the end of the drive shaft, which is 
turned away from the transmission.

The rotor position sensor is secured at the stator of the electrical machine and works according to 
the tilt sensor principle. There are three coils in the rotor position sensor. A defined AC voltage is 
fed to one of the coils. The other two coils are each moved 90°. The voltages induced in these coils 
provide information about the angle setting of the rotor. The rotor position sensor is mounted by the 
manufacturer of the electrical machine at the corresponding alignment so that it is already correctly 
adjusted. A precise adjustment of the rotor position sensor is effected during production, after which 
the electrical machine and electrical machine electronics are joined. The adjustment values are stored 
in the control unit of the electrical machine electronics. 

A 

Neither an adjustment nor a replacement of the rotor position sensor can be performed in BMW 
Service. 


A 

If the electrical machine or the electrical machine electronics are replaced, the code for the angle must 
be noted via diagnosis in the electrical machine electronics. The code for the angle can be found on 
the type plate of the electrical machine.

The graphics in this document show the electrical machine and the transmission without coating. In 
the production vehicle sometimes these components are still covered by a foam part. This serves for 
the acoustic encapsulation of the electric motor and absorbs noises which the customer may find 
irritating. 

The housing of the electrical machine is airtight and waterproof, as the low installation location 
demands this and to avoid damage by water passing through. However, due to the big temperature 
differences which may occur during operation there is a need for pressure compensation. This is 
effected via the shaft used for the electrical connection for the electrical machine electronics. 

The mounting and storage is not only related to the electrical machine itself, but also the entire drive

In the direction of travel on the left an engine support arm connects the housing of the electrical

force of the drive unit. Via this engine support arm the drive torque is also transmitted to the rear 
axle module and ultimately supported at the body. The entire drive unit (electrical machine, electrical 
machine electronics and transmission) is also connected to the rear axle module via the anti-roll bar 
link.

If the electrical machine has to be removed, the entire rear axle must be removed beforehand. This also 
applies to the removal of the transmission and the electrical machine electronics. Only then can the 
additional supports be removed from the housings and the individual components also removed.

Electrical machine (entirety) 


There is a high-voltage interface and a low-voltage interface. The high-voltage interface is made up of 
three phases. A bidirectional DC/AC converter in the electrical machine electronics generates three- 
phase AC voltage, which is transmitted to the coils in the stator of the electrical machine. With this the 
electrical machine is controlled and its operating mode - as an engine or alternator - is specified. The 
electrical lines or connections are screwed and concealed under a lid. 

The low-voltage interface consists solely of the signal lines of the following sensors: 

• Temperature sensors of stator coil (2x) 

• Temperature sensor of rotor (at a bearing) 

• Rotor position sensor. 

The electrical machine electronics measures the electrical resistance of the two temperature sensors, 
which are designed as negative temperature coefficients, and thus determines the temperatures at 
the two locations in the electrical machine. In addition, the electrical machine electronics generates 
AC voltage for the rotor position sensor and evaluates the signals of this sensor (two induced AC 
voltages). The electrical connection consists of a plug connection, which is concealed under the same 
lid as the high-voltage connection. 


3.2. Transmission 

3.2.1. Introduction 

The transmission of the 101 must fulfil the following tasks: 

• Transmission of engine speed and torque from the electrical machine to the output shafts 

• Engine speed adjustment between the two output shafts or sprockets 

• Securing the vehicle against rolling away. 

To fulfil these tasks the transmission contains the subcomponents listed below: 


29 








101 High-voltage Components 

3. Electric Motor 

• Transmission gearing with two spur gear units (central transmission) 

• Differential integrated in the transmission housing 

• Electromechanically operated parking lock. 

As the electrical machine offers a large usable engine speed range, the transmission of the 101 also 
only has to provide one gear, i.e. a fixed gear ratio. A combustion engine cannot deliver torque when 
the engine speed is zero. Unlike the electrical machine of the 101: Its high torque is already available 
when the engine speed is zero meaning a clutch in the transmission of the 101 is not required - not for 
driving off or for shifting gears. 



Gear selector switch 101 

The transmission in the 101 is operated using a mono-stable rotary gear selector switch. The gear 
selector switch offers the option of selecting the familiar drive positions "P", "N", "R", "D". The drive 
positions are shown as a shift pattern with auxiliary lines. The current drive position is highlighted. 

The following table shows how the individual drive positions are realized.

Electrical Digital Motor Electronics EDME 


The EDME control unit contains the logics, i.e. the preconditions when the parking lock is to be 
engaged or disengaged. Via the PT-CAN the EDME control unit sends the corresponding commands 
to the electrical machine electronics. 



Electrical machine electronics (EME) 

The EME control unit activates the parking lock actuator directly. It behaves similarly with the function 
of the other drive positions "R" and "D". Also here the EDME control unit calculates the logic part. 

The electrical machine electronics is responsible for the implementation, for example to activate the 
electrical machine for reversing or forwards travel. Finally, the transmission of the 101 also offers the 
functions shift lever interlock and interlock, whose logic part is also calculated in the EDME control unit 
(see section "Shift-by-Wire function").

3.2.2. Transmission 

The transmission of the 101 was developed by the BMW Group and its being produced in the BMW 
plant in Dingolfing. 

The transmission has an overall ratio of 9.7:1. The engine speed at the transmission input is 9.7 
times greater than at the transmission output. This ratio is realized using two spur gear units. In 
addition to the input shaft, there is also an intermediate shaft in the transmission. The spur gear unit 
at the transmission output is fixed to the differential cage and drives the differential. The differential 
distributes the torque to two outputs and enables the engine speed adjustment between the two 
outputs. The differential has an almost identical design to that of a front axle differential, as used 
in BMW vehicles with a four-wheel drive (front axle differential 156). For use in the 101 only surface 
hardening measures and a high-strength material are used.

An axle transmission oil known from conventionally driven BMW vehicles is used as transmission 
oil (manufacturer designation, e.g. Castrol BOT-448). The transmission housing is also used as an 
oil sump and holds the full capacity of 0.5 I transmission oil. The spur gear units and the differential 
run in the transmission oil and ensure the entire transmission is lubricated (oil sump lubrication). The 
transmission oil is designed for the operating life of the 101 meaning there is no need for a replacement 
of the transmission oil. Nevertheless, there is an oil drain plug, as well as an oil filler plug, with which 
the oil level can also be checked. These are shown in a graphic in the chapter "Mechanical interfaces". 

The transmission is not integrated in the cooling system of the electric motor and therefore has no 
connections for coolant lines. The heat in the transmission which arises during operation is low. 
Sufficient heat is discharged via the air flowing by at the transmission housing and the connection 
for the electrical machine. The temperature in the transmission remains in a range up to a maximum 
120 °C, for which the components and the transmission oil are designed. The transmission can, 
however, also absorb significantly lower temperatures: When driving off after a long immobilization 
period the components have the ambient temperature. As a result of the large temperature range 
excess pressure or a vacuum would occur in a completely tight housing. To avoid this there is a 
bleeding hole above at the transmission housing. It has a cap to protect against dirt contamination. 

The bleeding hole is also shown in a graphic in the chapter "Mechanical interfaces". 

3.2.3. Mechanical interfaces 

Mounting and torque support 

The mounting and support of the drive torque is not only related to the transmission, but also the 
entire drive unit comprising the electrical machine, transmission and electrical machine electronics. 
The weight force and drive torque are transmitted to the rear axle module via engine support arm and 
anti-roll bar link and from there to the body.

entering the electrical machine from there. For this purpose, the sealing ring marked in the graphic, 
which has the letter "X" in the cross-section, is used. 

There is another sealing ring on the transmission input shaft. It seals the hub space of the electrical 
machine, which is filled with grease. With the sealing ring the grease filled during installation remains in 
the hub space and ensures the lubrication during the entire service life of the vehicle. 

Ring-shaped through-holes arranged on the transmission housing hold the aluminium screws for 
connecting the housing of the transmission and the electrical machine. 

A_ 

The aluminium screws must be replaced after disassembly! 


Interface for the output shafts 

The output shafts are connected in the outputs of the differential. The torque is transmitted by the 
positive connection (gearing) between the output shafts and the differential. A radial shaft seal, as 
known from conventional BMW vehicles, seals the oil chamber of the transmission. 

Covers 

The graphics in this document show the electrical machine and the transmission without its covers. In 
the vehicle sometimes these components are still covered by a foam part. This serves for the acoustic

3.2.4. Parking lock 

Introduction 

The parking lock is responsible for securing the vehicle against rolling away, just like in a conventional 
vehicle with automatic transmission. Even on steep inclines/downhill gradients up to 32% the parking 
lock is able to safely hold the 101 at a standstill. Nevertheless, just like for conventional vehicles it is 
recommended to also secure the vehicle against rolling away using the parking brake. 


36 










101 High-voltage Components 

3. Electric Motor 


The driver can engage the parking lock in the 101 using the P button at the gear selector switch. It 
is, however, automatically engaged and under the same conditions known from BMW vehicles with 
an electronic gear selector switch. For example, the parking lock is automatically engaged when it 
is detected that the driver has left the vehicle (driver's door open, seat belt open and the pedals not 
operated). In contrast to conventional vehicles, there is a further precondition, where disengaging the 
parking lock in the 101 is not possible. This precondition prevents the driver taking off unintentionally 
as long as a charging cable is connected. 

A 

The parking lock of the 101 cannot be disengaged if a connected charging cable is identified. 


Structure and operating principle 

The parking lock comprises an electromechanical part (parking lock actuator) and a mechanical part 
(parking lock pawl and parking lock gear) in the transmission housing. The mechanical part functions 
at the transmission input shaft, as highlighted from the following transmission skeleton and sectioning.

The parking lock module functions at a driving shaft. At the end of the driving shaft there is a bar which 
is turned about 70 degrees by the revolution of the driving shaft. As a result, the parking lock pawl is 
inserted into the parking lock gear and the transmission input shaft is blocked. By resetting the bar 
the parking lock pawl is released again, pulled from the parking lock gear by the return spring and the 
transmission input shaft is unlocked. The driving shaft is held in the two positions, "engaged" and 
"disengaged", by a fixing element. The fixing element locks into the respective recesses at the cam 
disc. The rod cannot be moved from these positions by movements or forces from the transmission. 
Both positions are stable without the supply of auxiliary power. It is also said: 

A 

The parking lock of the 101 is bi-stable. This means it requires external energy in order to change the 
condition of the parking lock. 


Energy is required for both disengaging and engaging the parking lock. In BMW vehicles with a 
conventional engine and automatic transmission energy is only required for disengaging the parking 
lock. 

The actuator of the parking lock is a direct current electric motor with gear/worm wheel transmission 
and two position sensors. All these parts are located in the housing and form one unit. The parking 
lock module is secured using three raised head Torx screws on the transmission housing and for now 
is not replaced in BMW Service. 

A 

The parking lock module is connected to the parking lock via a multi-tooth connection of the actuator/ 
driving shaft at the transmission interface. Attention: The vehicle must be secured against rolling 
away by other measures (e.g. by operating the parking brake or positioning a wedge). 


The electric motor in the parking lock module is activated directly by an output stage in the electrical 
machine electronics. The output stage is current-limited to protect against damage by a short circuit. 

In order not to overload the electric motor, the power consumption is also measured and a current 
limitation performed in the software of the electrical machine electronics. 

The electric motor is supplied with current until the position sensors display that the parking lock has 
adopted the desired condition. The position sensors work according to the hall-effect principle and 
record the movement in the transmission of the parking lock module. As the function of the parking 
lock is relevant for safety, two redundant position sensors are used to achieve the requested reliability. 
If a sensor signal fails due to a fault, an active engaging or disengaging procedure can be completed as 
a result of the redundancy. The position sensors generate signals which are evaluated by the electrical 
machine electronics. 

As the position sensors record the movement of the electric motor in the parking lock module and not 
the movement of the actual parking lock mechanics, an initialization has to be performed as a one-off 
so that a conclusion can be drawn about the condition of the parking lock from the sensor signals. 

The following graphic shows the electrical structure of the parking lock module and the electrical 
connection for the electrical machine electronics.

Service information 

The EME control unit performs several self-diagnosis functions in order to ensure the proper function 
of the parking lock module and to protect the components against damage. These self-diagnosis 
functions are: 

• Monitoring of lines for the electric motor, the position sensors and the solenoids for short 
circuit against ground and supply voltage, as well as for open circuit 

• Monitoring of the current level for the electric motor with regards to the maximum value and 
plausibility for the signals of the position sensors 

• Monitoring of the signals of the position sensors (pulse-width modulated signal in the 
specified range and plausibility of both signals to each other). 

If one of the self-diagnosis functions identifies a fault, in the EME control unit an entry is made in the 
fault memory which can indicate the fault cause. Depending on the severity of the identified fault the 
parking lock will either work again or remain in the current position. In each case, however, a fault code 
entry is generated and the customer is requested by a Check Control message to have the vehicle 
checked by BMW Service. 

If the cause for a malfunction cannot be determined using the fault code entry, the Service employee 
can perform the following checks and thus pinpoint the cause: 

• Check the voltage supply of the electric motor at the output of the electrical machine 
electronics with a measurement 

• Check the wiring harness section for open circuit/short circuit. 

The diagnosis system not only supports the Service employee during troubleshooting for the parking 
lock. The diagnosis system also offers Service functions. The most important Service function is used 
for the initialization of the parking lock. During the initialization the electric motor in the parking lock 
module approaches its end positions several times. The signals of the position sensors and also the 
characteristic of the current level, which the electric motor uses, are observed. The force which the 
electric motor must apply and also the current characteristic change through the locking positions at 
the cam disc and the force which the fixing element exerts. The EME control unit uses these values to 
calculate the positions at which the parking lock is correctly engaged or disengaged. The respective 
signal values of the position sensors are stored permanently in the EME control unit and are available 
from this time for the control of the operation of the parking lock. 

A 

The initialization of the parking lock in the 101 using the diagnosis system is necessary if 

• the transmission was replaced, 

• the parking lock module was replaced or 

• the electrical machine electronics was replaced. 


If the parking lock module is to be replaced, ensure that the new part is supplied in the position which 
corresponds to the condition "Parking lock disengaged". Proceed as follows to install the new parking 
lock module: 

1 Secure the vehicle against rolling away using the parking brake

2 Move the driving shaft of the parking lock into the locking position for "Parking lock disengaged", 
if necessary, by moving 70° anti-clockwise. 

3 Install the new parking lock module. 

A_ 

An emergency operation of the parking lock module is not intended! The 101 cannot be towed away. It 
can only be transported on a loading platform. 


3.3. Drive control 

The electric motor of the 101 is a distributed system with a variety of components. This is also 
discernible in the electronic part, the drive control, because several components (control units) are also 
involved here. The master role for the control of the electric motor in the 101 is assumed by the engine 
control. It is modelled after vehicles with a gasoline engine with "Electrical Digital Motor Electronics" 
EDME. 



Installation location of the EDME 

As the most important partner control unit of the EDME, the electrical machine electronics assumes 
the activation of the electrical machine and the supply of energy to the low-voltage vehicle electrical 
system. Other partner control units of the EDME include the battery management electronics SME 
and the convenience charging electronics KLE.

Display information on the condition of the electric motor and Check Control 
messages in the event of a fault 


The upper graphic shows that the EDME control unit acts as a master and coordinator for the primary 
functions of the drive control. 

Before a drive torque is applied, the EDME must check whether the driving readiness is established. 
The EDME also queries whether all subsystems of the electrical drive train are functioning trouble- 
free, which is also a prerequisite for the provision of a drive torque. Finally, the EDME still has to 
consider the available electrical power for the electric motor which is primarily determined by the 
condition of the high-voltage battery. The SME control unit communicates this condition to the EDME 
control unit via corresponding bus signals. As a result of these checks the EDME identifies whether 
and in what scope the drive torque can be provided. In the case of fault statuses or in the event of 
limited availability, the EDME issues an appropriate Check Control message via the instrument cluster. 
The functions described here can be summarized under the term "Operating strategy". 

An important input signal for the determination of the drive torque is the accelerator pedal angle, which 
is transmitted via direct wiring from the accelerator pedal module to the EDME. Using this signal the 
EDME determines the torque request of the driver. The EDME must compare and coordinate this 
torque request and any other torque requests made at the same time, for example from the cruise 
control or the DSC. Using this input information the EDME can calculate the actual drive torque 
required of the electrical machine. 


47 













101 High-voltage Components 

3. Electric Motor 


In order to generate the drive torque using the electrical machine, the phase voltages (size, frequency 
and phase) have to be generated at the coils of the electrical machine. This task is not completed by 
the EDME itself, but by the electrical machine electronics EME. Via bus signals on the PT-CAN2 the 
EDME sends the requested drive torque to the EME. The EME control unit then calculates the phase 
voltages and the power electronics of the EME, which is located in its own housing, generates the 
phase voltages. 

Shift-by-Wire function 

Another important function of the drive control is the shift-by-wire function, which evaluates the 
electronic gear selector switch and other signals, in order to simulate the drive positions of a 
conventional automatic transmission (P, R, N, D). 

The change between the drive positions is achieved in the 101 the same way as in conventional 
vehicles with automatic transmission and electronic gear selector switch. Some important 
preconditions and functions are listed below: 

• Interlock: Change from P to another drive position only when driving readiness is switched on 

• Shift lever interlock: Change from P or N to D or R only when brake pedal is operated at the 
same time 

• Change from P or R to N or D only when selector lever is operated at the same time 

• Automatic engaging of P: P is automatically engaged from the other drive positions (at vehicle 
standstill) if neither the brake pedal or accelerator pedal are operated, the driver's door is 
open and the driver's seat belt is not inserted in the seat belt buckle. P is also automatically 
engaged if the driving readiness is switched off 

• Car wash function: When the driving readiness is switched on engage drive position N, switch 
off driving readiness. N remains engaged. 

As the transmission of the 101 only has a fixed ratio, there are no gears and thus also no adaptive EGS, 
no Sport program and also no manual program. The transmission also has no clutch to interrupt or 
establish the power transmission. There is also no reverse gear in the transmission of the 101. The 
following table shows how the drive control in the EDME realizes the individual drive positions:

3. Electric Motor 


The selector level position N is thus not achieved by opening a clutch in the transmission. Instead, the 
electrical machine is activated so that it neither generates an engine nor alternator torque. One can 
therefore imagine as if the coils of the stator were open and no voltage is applied from outside. There 
is in fact voltage, generated by the electrical machine electronics - however, this is adjusted in the 
amplitude, frequency and phase so that the rotor can rotate without a load (torque 0 Nm). 

The difference between the drive positions N and P is solely in the condition of the parking lock 
module. In N it is disengaged, in P it is engaged. 

Power management function 

For historical reasons and due to an indirect relation to the drive functions, other functions are 
integrated in the drive control units, especially in the EDME control unit. 

For many years the electrical power management of conventional vehicles has been integrated as 
a function in the engine control. The evaluation of the 12V battery state of charge via the IBS and 
the consumer shutdown are examples for this power management function. This tradition is also 
continued in the 101: The EDME control unit performs the power management function for the low- 
voltage vehicle electrical system. The power management in the low-voltage vehicle electrical system 
includes the following subfunctions: 

• Determination of the current energy requirement of the electrical consumers (signals in the 
form of bus signals, e.g. switch-on status of exterior lights by the Body Domain Controller 
BDC) 

• Determination of state of health, state of charge and charge current/discharge current of the 
12V battery (signals from the IBS) 

• Controling the power of the DC/DC converter 

• Monitoring of the standby current 

• Switch-off of terminals or consumers in order to protect the 12V battery against heavy 
discharge. 

The task of the conventional 12V alternator is assumed in the 101 by the DC/DC converter in the 
electrical machine electronics. Depending on the power required, the power management in the 
EDME requests corresponding power from the electrical machine electronics via bus signals. 

3.3.3. Electrical Digital Motor Electronics (EDME) 

The designation "Electrical Digital Motor Electronics (EDME)" reflects the electric motor in the 101 
(in comparison to the conventional drive with a combustion engine). The manufacturer of the EDME 
control unit is "Delphi Electronics Group". The manufacturer's internal designation is "DCM 3.8" - this 
Delphi engine control unit is already used by other vehicle manufacturers and was adapted for the 101 
in terms of the electrical interfaces. 

The installation location is shown in the following graphic: 


49 



101 High-voltage Components 

3. Electric Motor 



Installation location of the EDME 


Active cooling of the EDME is not intended as at the installation location there is a significantly lower 
temperature level as a result of no combustion engine in the 101. The EDME control unit also has 
considerably fewer output stages in comparison to an engine control for combustion engines and 
therefore less heat loss occurs in the control unit itself. 

The electrical interfaces of the EDME control unit are described in the list below: 

• 12V voltage supply of the EDME control unit (terminal 30B, ground connection) 

• Accelerator pedal module with two hall-effect sensors: Supply voltage, ground and sensor 
output signals with output voltage range of 0 V to 2.5 V and 0 V to 5.0 V 

• Brake light switch and brake light test switch: inverse, redundant signals (actuated/not 
actuated), supply via terminal R 

• Local interconnect network bus: Reading of the signals from the IBS and control of the electric 
coolant pump (cooling circuit between electrical machine/electrical machine electronics and 
charging electronics) 

• Control of the electric fan: The power of the electric fan for cooling the cooling package at 
the front can be controlled via a pulse-width modulated signal by the EDME. For emergency 
operation there is a relay with which the electric fan can be switched on at full power by the 
EDME. 

• Body Domain Controller BDC (start enable) 

• PT-CAN (no terminating resistor in the EDME) 

• PT-CAN2 (no terminating resistor in the EDME) 

• FlexRay (terminating resistor in the EDME). 

The functions of the drive control are already described in detail in the chapter "Functions". The 
following list summarizes again the functions which the EDME control unit calculates and performs:

4.1. Electrical machine electronics (EME) 

4.1.1. Introduction 

The electrical machine electronics EME serves mainly as control electronics for the electrical machine, 
which drives the 101. It assumes the task of converting the DC voltage (up to about 400 V DC) from 
the high-voltage battery into a three-phase AC voltage (up to about 360 V AC) for activating the 
electrical machine as a motor. Vice versa, when the electrical machine works as an alternator, the 
electrical machine electronics converts the three-phase AC voltage of the electrical machine to a 
direct current voltage and can thus charge the high-voltage battery. This takes place during brake 
energy regeneration. For these two operating modes a bidirectional DC/AC converter is necessary 
which can work as both an inverter and a rectifier. 

The DC/DC converter which is also integrated in the electrical machine electronics ensures the voltage 
supply to the 12V vehicle electrical system. The electrical machine electronics has another control 
unit which bears the same name, "EME" for short. 

The entire electrical machine electronics of the 101 is located in an aluminium housing. The control 
unit of the bidirectional AC/DC converter for the conversion of the AC voltage to direct current voltage 
for charging the high-voltage battery, as well as conversion of the direct current voltage from the high- 
voltage battery to 3-phase AC voltage and the DC/DC converter for the voltage supply of the 12V 
vehicle electrical system are located in this housing. 

A_ 

The housing of the electrical machine electronics cannot be opened in Service. 


The electrical machine electronics of the 101 is developed and supplied by the relevant departments of 
BMW AG. The production is carried out in a division of the plant in Dingolfing. 

A 

Only Service employees who satisfy all the prerequisites are permitted to work on the designated 
high-voltage components: suitable qualifications, compliance with the safety rules, procedure 
following the exact repair instructions. 

The diagnosis and repair of the high-voltage components is only allowed in a retail service 
center that has qualified and certified service technicians. These technicians must have 
completed the ST1403b 101 High Voltage Battery and Maintenance instructor led course and 
successfully passed the hands on certification. 


4.1.2. Installation location 

The electrical machine electronics is installed in the rear of the 101, in an area separated from the 
luggage compartment.

connection and also sealed by a gasket. 

The accesses described are not sufficient for the removal and installation of the electrical machine 
electronics. Instead, the entire drive unit (comprising transmission, electrical machine and electrical 
machine electronics) must be removed.

• Voltage supply for the EME control unit (terminal 30B from the power distribution box at the 
front and ground) 

• Terminal 30C from the safety battery terminal (is evaluated by the EME control unit in order to 
identify an accident) 

• Bus system PT-CAN2 (In the EME control unit there is a terminating resistor with 120 Q for 
the PT-CAN2) 

• Wake-up line 

• Control line for the convenience charging electronics to enable the charging procedure 

• Input and output of the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop (EME control unit evaluates 
the signal and initiates a shutdown of the high-voltage system in the event of an open circuit of 
the circuit)

• Electromechanical parking lock: Voltage supply and signal of the position sensors, voltage 
supply of the solenoid and the electric motor 

• Brake vacuum sensor (supply and evaluation of a pressure-dependent resistance) 

• Voltage supply of the electrical vacuum pump. 

These lines and signals have relatively low current levels. The electrical machine electronics is 
connected to the 12 V vehicle electrical system (terminals 30 and 31) via two separate low-voltage 
connections and lines with large cross-section. Via this connection the DC/DC converter in the 
electrical machine electronics provides the entire 12 V vehicle electrical system with energy. These 
two lines are not connected to the electrical machine electronics via a plug connection, but a screw 
connection. 


The connections of the electrical machine electronics to the electrical machine are not visible from the 
outside. They are located under a lid on the right side of the electrical machine.

4.1.4. Structure and functions 

The electrical machine electronics is made up internally of four subcomponents: the bidirectional DC/ 
AC converter, the unidirectional AC/DC converter, the DC/DC converter and the EME control unit. The 
link capacitors are also an element of the power electronics switching in order to smooth the voltage 
and filter high-frequency parts. 

It performs the following functions with help of the subcomponents mentioned: 

• Control of the internal subcomponents by the EME control unit 

• Supply of the 12V electrical system via the DC/DC converter 

• Control of the electrical machine (engine speed, torque) using DC/AC converter 

• High-voltage power management 

• Contacting of the electric motor via busbars 

• Contact of the high-voltage battery 

• Charging the high-voltage battery when stationary 

• Contact of the convenience charging electronics 

• Contact of the EKK 

• Contact of the electric heating 

• Contact of the Range Extender Electrical Machine Electronics 

• Communication with other control units, in particular the EDME 

• Cooling for electrical machine electronics 

• Evaluation of sensors of the electromechanical parking lock 

• Activation of the electromechanical parking lock 

• Activating the electrical vacuum pump 

• Active and passive discharging of the link capacitors to voltages less then 60 V 

• Active evaluation of the signal for the high-voltage interlock loop 

• Self-test and diagnostic function 

DC/DC converter 

The DC/DC converter in the electrical machine electronics of the 101 is also able to adopt the following 
operating modes: 


61 








101 High-voltage Components 

4. Electrical Machine Electronics 


• Standby (also in the event of a component fault or short circuit, power electronics off) 

• Buck mode (Energy flow to the low-voltage side. Converter controls voltage on low-voltage 
side) 

• Discharging the high-voltage link capacitor (interlock fault, accident, request from master). 

The DC/DC converter is in "Standby" mode when the electrical machine electronics is not in 
operation. This is the case when the EME control unit is not supplied with voltage due, for example, 
to a terminal status. But also if there is a fault the EME control unit prompts the DC/DC converter to 
assume "Standby" mode. In this operating mode there is no energy transfer between the two vehicle 
electrical systems and they remain galvanically separated. 

Buck mode is the normal operating mode when the high-voltage system is active. The DC/DC 
converter transfers electrical energy from the high-voltage electrical system to the 12V vehicle 
electrical system and assumes the function of the alternator in a conventional vehicle. The DC/DC 
converter must reduce the varying voltage from the high-voltage electrical system to the voltage in the 
low-voltage vehicle electrical system. The voltage in the high-voltage electrical system is dependent, 
for example, on the state of charge of the high-voltage battery (about 260 V to about 390 V). The 
voltage in the low-voltage vehicle electrical system controls the DC/DC converter so that the 12V 
battery is optimally charged and sets a voltage of about 14V depending on the state of charge and the 
temperature of the battery. The EME control unit communicates with the EDME control unit, in which 
the 12V power management functions are performed. The result is the setpoint value specification for 
the voltage, which the DC/DC converter should adjust in the low-voltage vehicle electrical system. The 
continuous output power of the DC/DC converter is 2500 W.

The technology of the DC/DC converter in the 101 would also enable the operating mode "Boost 
mode", such as the DC/DC converter in the F04. However, this operating mode is not used in the 101. 
Charging of the high-voltage battery of the 101 is not possible using energy from the 12V vehicle 
electrical system. 

The last operating mode of the DC/DC converter is assumed during (regular or quick) shutdown of the 
high-voltage system. For the shutdown of the high-voltage system the system must be discharged 
to a safe voltage less than 60 V within a specified time. The DC/DC converter has a discharge circuit 
for the link capacitors. First of all, these try to transmit the energy stored in the link capacitors to 
the low-voltage vehicle electrical system. If this does not lead to a sufficiently quick reduction of the 
voltage, the discharging is effected via an active resistor. This way the high-voltage electrical system 
is discharged in less than 5 seconds. For safety reasons there is also a so-called passive discharge

resistor (switched in parallel). This enables a reliable discharge of the high-voltage electrical system if 
the first two measures do not work for discharging due to a fault. The period up until the discharge to a 
voltage below 60 V is longer and is maximum 120 s.

The temperature of the DC/DC converter is measured using a temperature sensor and monitored 
by the EME control unit. If the temperature exceeds the permissible range despite cooling using the 
coolant, the EME control unit reduces the power of the DC/DC converter to protect the components. 

Power electronics for activation of the electrical machine 

The power electronics for the activation of the electrical machine are mainly made up of the 
bidirectional DC/AC converter. It is a pulse converter with a two-pin DC voltage connection and a 3- 
phase AC voltage connection. This DC/AC converter can work as an inverter and conduct electrical 
energy from the high-voltage battery to the electrical machine when it should work as an engine. 
However, it can also work as a rectifier and transfers electrical energy from the electrical machine to 
the high-voltage battery. This operating mode occurs during brake energy regeneration in which the 
electrical machine works as an alternator and "generates" electrical energy.

Electrical machine 


The operating mode of the DC/AC converter is defined by the EME control unit. The EME control 
unit also receives the setpoint values (essential input variables) from the EDME control unit for which 
torque (amount and sign) the electrical machine should supply. From this setpoint value and the 
current operating condition of the electrical machine (engine speed and torque) the EME control 
unit determines the operating mode of the DC/AC converter, as well as the amplitude and frequency 
of the phase voltages for the electrical machine. According to these specifications, the power 
semiconductors of the DC/AC converter are activated in sync. 

In addition to the DC/AC converter, the power electronics also contains current sensors in all three 
phases on the AC voltage side of the DC/AC converter. Using the signals from the current sensor, the 
EME control unit monitors the electrical power which is used in the power electronics and electrical 
machine and what torque the electrical machine generates. The control loop of the electrical machine 
electronics is closed by the signals of the current sensors and the rotor position sensor in the electrical 
machine. 

The performance data of the electrical machine electronics and the electrical machine are coordinated 
in development. The electrical machine electronics must be able to provide continuous electrical 
power of 75 kW and supply a maximum power of 125 kW for a short time. In order to avoid overloading 
the power electronics, there is also another temperature sensor at the DC/AC converter. If an excessive 
temperature of the power semiconductor is identified using this signal, the EME control unit reduces 
the power delivered to the electrical machine in order to protect the power electronics. The customer 
is informed via a Check Control message in the case of a noticeable power reduction. The customer 
receives the same error response (power reduction) and the same Check Control message if the 
temperature of the electrical machine exceeds the permissible range.

High-voltage power management 

The power management for the high-voltage electrical system includes two subfunctions: one for 
driving and one for charging mode. In driving mode the energy flows from the high-voltage battery 
to the high-voltage consumers are coordinated. The following steps are performed by the EME and 
repeated constantly: 

1 Query of the power available from the high-voltage battery (signal source: SME) 

2 Query of the requested power from the electric motor (signal source: EDME) 

3 Query of the requested power for climate control (electric heating, EKK, IHKA) 

4 Decision on the distribution of the electrical power and communication to the control units of the 
consumers. 

For charging mode the task of the high-voltage power management is different: It controls the energy 
flow from outside the vehicle via the EME and/or the convenience charging electronics KLE to the 
high-voltage battery and if required to the electric heating or to the EKK. The procedure constantly 
repeated in the EME consists of the following individual steps: 

1 Query of the available power from outside (signal source: LIM) 

2 Query of the power which the high-voltage battery can use (SME) 

3 Query of the power which is required for the climate control (IHKA) 

4 Requesting the necessary power from the (EME/KLE) 

5 Communication of the available partial powers to the receiver of the high-voltage battery (SME 
control unit) and heating and air-conditioning system (IHKA control unit). 

The externally available power cannot be at a high level; it is restricted by the power network and the 
EME/KLE. Therefore, the available power must be queried first before it can be distributed. The high- 
voltage battery cannot absorb much power, for example due to its state of charge, which is why this 
value is also queried first. Depending on the temperature of the high-voltage battery or on a heating or 
an air-conditioning request by the driver, the heating and air-conditioning system also needs electrical 
power, whose amount is the third important input signal for the high-voltage power management in the 
charging mode. Using this information the externally requested power is controlled and distributed to 
the consumers. 

Voltage supply for other high-voltage consumers 

The electrical machine electronics supplies voltage not only to the electrical machine. The high- 
voltage consumers "EKK" and "electric heating" also receive their high-voltage supply from the 
electrical machine electronics. 

However, there is no complex control function in the electrical machine electronics. Instead, the 
electrical machine electronics serves as a simple distributor of the high-voltage direct current voltage, 
which is provided by the high-voltage battery. In order to protect the high-voltage cable for the two 
high-voltage consumers against overloading in the event of a short circuit, the electrical machine 
electronics contains a high-voltage fuse for the EKK and a high-voltage fuse for the electric heating. 
Both high-voltage fuses have a nominal current level of 40 A. 

The distribution and the electrical connection of the fuses are already shown in the chapter "High- 
voltage connections".

Activation of the parking lock 

The electromechanical parking lock of the 101 including its operating principle and activation is 
described in detail in the section "Electric motor". Therefore, only the key aspects of the activation are 
mentioned here. The electrical machine electronics contains the following components required for 
the parking lock: 

• Output stage for the activation of the electric motor in the parking lock module 

• Current sensor for the monitoring of the electric motor 

• Evaluation electronics for sensor signals. 

The output stage for the activation of the electric motor only comprises one bridge circuit of power 
transistors. It is able to supply the electric motor with the necessary current of about 3 A to 4 A during 
the operation, as well as supply the high starting current for the electric motor of up to 10 A. The 
bridge circuit is designed so that it will not suffer damage in the event of a short circuit at the output 
(current limitation). In order to protect the electric motor and the line against overloading, the EME 
control unit monitors the current level of the output stage and also restricts it if required. For this 
purpose, the output stage contains a current sensor, whose signal is evaluated by the EME control 
unit. 

The two redundant position sensors in the parking lock module are hall-effect sensors. The EME 
control unit provides the voltage supply for the sensors. It also reads in the signals from the position 
sensors, validates their plausibility and evaluates them. Using the signals of the position sensors 
the EME control unit determines the status of the parking lock (engaged/disengaged) and makes 
the status available as a bus signal. This is read in for example by the EDME control unit where the 
transmission functions, e.g. engaging the drive positions, are calculated. 

The familiar graphic from the chapter "Electric motor > Transmission > Parking lock" shows the 
electrical interface between the parking lock module and the electrical machine electronics.

Activation of the electrical vacuum pump 

The electrical machine electronics provides the hardware for the evaluation of the signals of the 
brake vacuum sensor and for the activation of the electrical vacuum pump. The function logic for 
the activation of the electrical vacuum pump is located not in the EME control unit, but in the DSC 
control unit. The EME and DSC control unit exchange sensor signals and the switch-on request for the 
electrical vacuum pump via bus signals at the PT-CAN and PT-CAN2. 

The brake vacuum sensor is mainly known from conventionally driven vehicles with automatic engine 
start-stop function. Similar to those vehicles, it is also installed in the 101 at the housing of the brake 
servo. 

The sensor is supplied with voltage from the electrical machine electronics and returns a voltage 
signal depending on the vacuum in the brake servo. This analog sensor signal is converted by the EME 
control unit to the actual brake vacuum and sent as a bus signal to the DSC control unit. 

The DSC control unit evaluates the brake vacuum signal, includes dynamic handling characteristics 
(e.g. the driving speed) and the accelerator pedal actuation and determines whether the electrical 
vacuum pump should be switched on. The function logic in the DSC control unit also takes into 
consideration a hysteresis so that the electrical vacuum pump is not constantly switched on and off. 
Instead, it remains switched on until a requested minimum level of the brake vacuum is reached. The 
DSC control unit sends back the switch-on request from the electrical vacuum pump as a bus signal to 
the EME control unit. 

The electrical machine electronics contains an output stage (semiconductor relay), with whose help 
the voltage supply of the electrical vacuum pump can be switched on and off. Upon request the 
output voltage of the DC/DC converter can be shifted through directly to the electrical vacuum pump. 
Switch-on currents of up to 30 A can occur in the process. The current level is restricted electronically 
to protect the output stage and the line. There is no control of the power or engine speed for the 
electrical vacuum pump - it is simply switched on and off. 

A malfunction of the electrical vacuum pump is identified using a brake vacuum sensor by means of 
the no longer available vacuum. At least the legally prescribed deceleration (increased brake pedal 
force) is available. The DSC will realize a type of hydraulic brake-servo assistance, i.e. depending on 
the driver pressure a hydraulically reinforced circuit pressure is generated. 

Advantage: Lower brake pedal force also in this fault scenario 

Disadvantage: Modified brake pedal response.

101 High-voltage Components 

5. High-voltage Battery Unit 

The high-voltage battery unit is the energy storage device for the electric motor of the 101. It is the 
equivalent to the fuel tank of a conventional vehicle with a combustion engine. Also in BMW active 
hybrid vehicles there is already a high-voltage battery unit, which supplies the electric motor with 
energy. In the BMW active hybrid the high-voltage battery is charged when the electrical machine is 
operated as an alternator. This happens during brake energy regeneration or by a load point increase 
of the combustion engine. In the 101 the high-voltage battery can also be partially charged during 
brake energy regeneration. However, it is mainly charged using energy from an external power 
network. An optional range extender can also provide electrical energy using a gasoline engine and 
another electrical machine. However, this is primarily used for maintaining the state of charge when the 
high-voltage battery is already heavily discharged. The range of the 101 can be increased. 


5.1. Overview 

The high-voltage battery of a vehicle with an electric motor is the equivalent to the fuel tank in a vehicle 
with a combustion engine: It is the energy storage device for the electric motor. In order to achieve 
the desired range of the 101, the amount of energy to be stored is correspondingly high, which is 
why the volume and weight of the energy storage device are also high. Nevertheless, some vehicle 
characteristics were positively influenced by the installation of the high-voltage battery unit in the Drive 
module of the 101: 

• Thanks to the low installation location the center of gravity of the vehicle is lowered, which 
reduces the roll tendency in bends, in particular. 

• The passenger compartment is not restricted by the high-voltage battery unit. 

• The high-voltage battery unit is well accessible in Service, which reduces the repair costs. 


5.1.1. Technical data 

The high-voltage battery unit of the 101 is made up of the following fundamental components: 

• Cell modules with the actual battery cells 

• Cell supervision circuits 

• Heat exchanger with coolant ducts and heating 

• Control unit, battery management electronics (SME) 

• Wiring harnesses 

• Safety box 

• Connections (electrical, refrigerant, venting) 

• Housing and fastening parts. 

The battery cells are supplied by Samsung SDI to the BMW plant in Dingolfing. There the cell modules 
are assembled from the battery cells and mounted into complete high-voltage battery units with the 
other components. The manufacturer of the SME control unit and the cell supervision circuit is Preh. 

The battery cells used in the high-voltage battery of the 101 are lithium-ion cells (cell type NMC/LMO 
mixture). The anode material of lithium-ion batteries is generally a lithium metal oxide. The designation 
"NMC/LMO mixture" refers to the metals used for this cell type: It is a mix of nickel, manganese and 
cobalt on the one hand, and lithium manganese oxide on the other hand. The characteristics of the 
high-voltage battery for use in an electric vehicle were able to be optimized through the selection of 


71 




101 High-voltage Components

the anode material (high energy density, high cycle number). Graphite is normally used for the cathode. 
The lithium ions are deposited in the cathode during discharging. As a result of the materials used 
the total nominal voltage of the battery cells is 3.75 V. The following table lists the most essential 
technical data of the high-voltage battery in the 101.

The high-voltage battery unit also has a low-voltage connection, as well as the high-voltage 
connection. The integrated control units are supplied with voltage, data bus, sensor and monitoring 
signals via this interface. It is incorporated in the refrigerant circuit for cooling the high-voltage battery. 
The label on the high-voltage battery unit informs people working with these components about the 
technology used and possible electrical and chemical dangers. 

A 

The electrical voltage of the high-voltage battery unit is well over 60 V. This is why before any work at 
the high-voltage battery unit the electrical safety rules must be observed: 

1 Disconnect the system from the power supply 

2 Provide a safeguard to prevent unintentional restarting 

3 Establish that the system is isolated from the power supply. 


The electrical lines (high-voltage and low-voltage), as well as the refrigerant lines, can be disconnected 
without having to remove the high-voltage battery unit. 

The high-voltage battery unit is located outside the passenger compartment. If the battery cells 
generate excess pressure due to a massive fault, the arising gases cannot be transported outwards via 
a vent pipe. A vent hole at the housing of the high-voltage battery unit is sufficient to allow pressure 
compensation. 

The high-voltage safety connector (Service Disconnect) is not an element of the high-voltage battery 
unit, just like in current BMW active hybrid vehicles. It is located below the engine compartment lid.

5.2. External features 


5.2.1. Mechanical interfaces 

The housing of the high-voltage battery unit is connected mechanically to the Drive module of the 
101 using a total of 26 screws. This way the weight and the acceleration forces occurring during the 
journey are supported at the body. The mounting bolts are accessible directly from below, without 
having to first disassemble the underbody paneling . For the removal of the high-voltage battery 
unit firstly all preliminary work specified in the repair instructions (diagnosis, disconnecting from the 
power supply, etc.) has to be performed. Before the mounting bolts are slackened the special tool for 
lowering (mobile table lift MHT 1200) must be positioned below the high-voltage battery unit. 

The electrical connection is established between the housing and Drive module by another potential 
compensation screw. 

A 

The low resistance connection between the housing of the high-voltage battery unit and ground (= 
Drive module) is a crucial prerequisite for the fault-free function of the automatic isolation monitoring. 
This is why it is important to ensure the correct tightening torque is applied for this potential 
compensation screw. 

It is also important to ensure that neither the housing of the high-voltage battery unit nor the Drive 
module at the respective bore holes is painted, corroded or dirty. The bare metal must be exposed if 
necessary before the potential compensation screw is mounted.

Similar to vehicles with a frame design, the Life-Drive concept is made up of two independent modules 
separated horizontally. The "Life" module consists mainly of a high-strength and very lightweight 
passenger cell made of carbon reinforced plastic. The "Drive" module, the chassis, forms the 
stable base, in which the high-voltage battery unit is integrated. Crash-active structures made from 
aluminium at the front end and rear end of the Drive module ensure additional safety in the event of 
a head-on and rear-end collision. The high-voltage battery unit is located in the vehicle underbody 
for the best possible protection as a vehicle suffers the least amount of deformation in this area in 
the event of a crash. In the event of a side collision the high-voltage battery unit also benefits from 
the crash properties of the Life module, as the entire energy is collected here and does not advance 
as far as the energy storage device. Overall, the high-strength carbon passenger compartment in 
conjunction with the intelligent force distribution in the LifeDrive module creates the prerequisite for 
optimal occupant safety. 

Three labels are attached at the high-voltage battery unit of the 101: one type plate and two warning 
stickers. The type plate provides logistical information (e.g. part number) and the key technical data 
(e.g. nominal voltage). The two warning stickers draw attention to the lithium-ion technology and the 
high electrical voltage used in the high-voltage battery unit and alert people to associated possible 
dangers. The following graphic shows where the three labels are located at the high-voltage battery 
unit.

Contact for shielding 


A contact is available for shielding around each of the two electrical contacts for the high-voltage 
cables. The shielding of the high-voltage cable (shielding for each cable) is continued into the housing 
of the high-voltage battery unit and thus contributes to the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). 

In addition, the high-voltage connection provides protection against contact with live parts. The 
actual contacts are coated in plastic so that nobody can touch them directly. Only when the cable is 
connected is the coating pushed away and the contact established. The plastic slide serves as the 
mechanical latch mechanism of the connector. In addition, it is also an element of a safety function: If 
the high-voltage cable is not connected, the slide conceals the connection for the bridge of the high- 
voltage interlock loop. Only when the high-voltage cable is properly connected and the connector 
is locked, is this connection accessible and the bridge can be inserted. This guarantees that only 
when a high-voltage cable is connected is the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop also closed. 
This principle applies to all high-voltage connections in the 101, for instance connections at the high- 
voltage battery unit, at the electrical machine electronics, at the convenience charging electronics 
and at the range extender electrical machine electronics. The high-voltage system can only be active 
when all high-voltage cables are connected. This is additional protection against contact with contact 
surfaces, which otherwise may carry voltage.

The high-voltage connection can be replaced as a separate component, just like all other components 
of the high-voltage battery unit. 

The diagnosis and repair of the high-voltage components is only allowed in a retail service 
center that has qualified and certified service technicians. These technicians must have 
completed the ST1403b 101 High Voltage Battery and Maintenance instructor led course and 
successfully passed the hands on certification. 


Low-voltage connections 

There are two low-voltage connections at the high-voltage battery unit of the 101: 

1 Connection for lines to the SME control unit 

2 Connection for the activation of the combined expansion and shutoff valve 
The connection for the SME control unit has the following lines: 

• Voltage supply of the SME control unit with terminal 30F and ground connection 

• Terminal 30C for the voltage supply of the electromechanical switch contactors 

• Wake-up line from the BDC 

81

• Input and output of the line for the high-voltage interlock loop 

• Output (+12 V and ground) for the activation of the combined shutoff and expansion valve 
(without heat pump) 

• PT-CAN2 

• Two unused signals (only for development purposes).

With the optional heat pump the actuating wires coming from the SME control unit for the combined 
expansion and shutoff valve initially lead into the wiring harness. From there they are guided directly 
to this valve. There are no other electrical vehicle components involved which may influence this 
activation signal. With the optional heat pump the activation of the combined expansion and shutoff 
valve is assumed by the heat pump control unit and not the SME control unit. The SME control unit

5.2.3. Vent hole 

The vent hole has two tasks. The first task of the vent hole is to offset large pressure differences 
between the inside and outside of the high-voltage battery unit. Such pressure differences can only 
arise in the event of a damaged battery cell. For safety reasons the housing of the cell module with the 
damaged battery cell is opened to reduce the pressure. The gases are initially located in the housing 
of the high-voltage battery unit. From there they can be transported outwards via the vent hole. 

The second task of the vent hole is to transport outwards condensate arising in the inside of the high- 
voltage battery unit. Besides the technical components, there is also air inside the high-voltage battery 
unit. If the air or the housing is cooled by a lower ambient temperature or by a refrigerant through the 
activation of the air conditioning function, some of the water vapor from the air condenses. This means 
small amounts of liquid water can form in the inside of the high-voltage battery unit. This has no affect 
on the function. During the next heating of the air or the housing the water evaporates again and, at the 
same time, the pressure in the housing rises slightly. The vent hole permits pressure compensation by 
allowing the warm air to escape outwards. The water vapor in the air is also transported outwards and 
also the previously liquid condensate. 

To fulfil these tasks the vent hole has a permeable diaphragm for gases (and water vapor) and an 
impermeable diaphragm for fluids. There is a two-piece cover located above the diaphragm with which 
the diaphragm is protected against coarse dirt contamination.

5. High-voltage Battery Unit 

If the housing of the high-voltage battery unit is also damaged, for example a crack, contact must be 
established with Technical Support to determine a suitable course of action. 


5.2.4. Interface for the refrigerant circuit 

It is incorporated in the refrigerant circuit of the heating and air-conditioning system for cooling the 
high-voltage battery. In order to be able to perform condition-based cooling, there is an electrically 
activated combined expansion and shutoff valve at the high-voltage battery unit. 

There are two versions of this valve. Which version is installed in the 101 depends on the equipment 
without/with heat pump (option 4T9). Without the optional heat pump the combined shutoff and 
expansion valve is hard-wired to the SME control unit and is activated directly by this control unit. The 
valve is closed currentless, i.e. no refrigerant flows into the high-voltage battery unit. The valve only 
knows two positions, "closed" and "open". The amount of flowing refrigerant is adjusted thermally. 

With the optional heat pump the combined expansion and shutoff valve is a constantly activated valve. 
The precise operating principle is described in the product information bulletin "101 Heating and Air- 
Conditioning System". 

The exact installation location of this valve is shown in a graphic in the chapter "Low-voltage 
connections". The operating principle of the cooling system is described in the next chapter. 


5.3. Heating and cooling system 

5.3.1. Overview 

To maximizethe service life of the high-voltage battery and obtain the greatest possible power, it is 
operated in a defined temperature range. The high-voltage battery unit is essentially operational in 
the range of -40 °C to +50 °C. These temperature limits, however, relate to the actual temperature 
of the cell, not the ambient temperature. In terms of temperature behavior the high-voltage battery 
unit is a slow-action system, i.e. it takes several hours until the cells assume the ambient temperature. 
Therefore having the battery spend a short period of time in an extremely hot or cold environment 
does not mean that the cells will already have assumed this temperature. 

The optimal range of the temperature of the cell with regard to service life and performance is more 
limited. It is between +25 °C and +40 °C. Mainly if the cell temperature is continuously significantly 
outside this range and, at the same time, high power is required, this would reduce the service life 
of the battery cells. To counteract this effect and ensure maximum performance at any ambient 
temperature, there is automatic heating and cooling for the high-voltage battery unit of the 101. 

The 101 is equipped as standard with a cooling system for the high-voltage battery. For this purpose 
it is incorporated in the refrigerant circuit of the heating and air-conditioning system, similar to current 
BMW active hybrid vehicles. If the customer orders optional equipment 494 (Seat heating) for driver 
and front passenger, his 101 also has heating for the high-voltage battery. The heat effect of the 
electrical current is used for heating up the high-voltage battery. This heating including the control is 
located inside the high-voltage battery unit. At a very low ambient temperature or cell temperature and 
with a connected charging cable, the heating is automatically activated if required in order to warm up 
the battery cells. This way the otherwise restricted performance is improved considerably at very low 
temperatures and the range can be increased.

Cooling system of the high-voltage battery 

The high-voltage battery unit in the 101 is cooled directly by refrigerant. The refrigerant circuit of the 
air conditioning system is therefore made up of two parallel branches: One for cooling the passenger 
compartment and one for cooling the high-voltage battery unit. For each branch there is a combined 
expansion and shutoff valve in order to be able to control the cooling functions independent of 
each other. The battery management electronics can activate and open the combined expansion 
and shutoff valve by applying voltage. In this way refrigerant can flow to the high-voltage battery, 
expanding, evaporating and cooling in the process. The cooling of the passenger compartment is also 
effected in a condition-based manner. The combined expansion and shutoff valve upstream from the 
evaporator can also be activated electrically and by the EDME.

During cooling the battery cells emit heat energy to the refrigerant. While the battery cells are cooled 
down, the refrigerant is heated. The EKK compresses the refrigerant again and in the capacitor it 
returns to a liquid state. As a result, the refrigerant is once again able to absorb heat energy. This way 
the maximum cooling power of about 1000 W can be generated. In other words: A heat output of up to 
1000 W can be discharged by the high-voltage battery. This maximum cooling power is only required 
at a very high ambient temperature and, at the same time, a high drive power. 

In order to cool battery cells using refrigerant, there is a heat exchanger located below the cell modules 
which is made from flat aluminium pipes. They are connected to the internal refrigerant lines and 
refrigerant flows through them during cooling. 

Heating 

Vice versa, if the 101 was parked outside for example for several days at temperatures below 0 °C, it 
makes sense to heat the battery cells before departure and/or to their optimal temperature level. They 
then deliver their full power before the journey commences. The customer can use this option if the 
vehicle is connected to the power network using the charging cable and the function for the interior 
air temperature control of the vehicle was selected. In order to warm up the batteries, the high-voltage 
system is activated and electrical current is sent through a network of heating wires. This network of 
heating wires is arranged along the coolant ducts. As the coolant ducts and the cell modules touch, 
the heat generated in the heater coils is transmitted to the cell modules and therefore the battery cells. 


5.4. Internal structure of the high-voltage battery unit 

The information on the internal structure and other functions of the high-voltage battery unit can be 
found in the product information bulletin "101 High-voltage Battery Unit".

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 

6.1. General information on charging 

6.1.1. Introduction 

The "charging" procedure for an electric vehicle corresponds to "refueling " a conventionally driven 
vehicle. Accordingly, in this chapter "charging" means: 

• Charging the high-voltage battery in the vehicle 

• while at standstill (not through brake energy regeneration), 

• by supply of electrical energy, 

• which is provided by an AC voltage network outside the vehicle 

• and is fed to the vehicle via a charging cable. 

As a charging cable is used, one also refers to conductive (grid-bound) charging. The inductive 
charging is not possible at the 101. It is still undergoing research and development. 

Components inside and outside the vehicle are required for charging. In the vehicle a charging socket 
and power electronics are required for the voltage conversion. Outside the vehicle a device which 
performs the protection and control functions is needed, in addition to the AC voltage network and a 
charging cable. This device is called an "Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)" in the standards 
and in development. The following graphic shows the components for the charging of the high-voltage 
battery inside and outside the electric vehicle and compares them to the components needed for 
refueling in a conventional vehicle.

The Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment can either be integrated in the charging cable or be an element 
of a fixed charging station (also called "wallbox"). The EVSE establishes the connection to the AC 
voltage network and serves for the fulfilment of requirements for electrical safety when charging the 
vehicle. Communication to the vehicle can also be set up via the pilot line. As a result, it is possible 
to safely start the charging procedure and exchange the charging parameters (e.g. maximum current 
level) between vehicle and EVSE. Details on the possible versions, structure and functioning of the 
EVSE are described in one of the following chapters. 

The voltage of the AC voltage network can be in the range of 110 V to 240 V. It is fed to the vehicle 
via a single-phase supply. From the AC voltage network side, in theory a maximum charging power of 
Pmax = U max x l max = 240 V x 32 A = 7.7 kW is possible. 

Many of the components mentioned for charging the 101 are standardized in terms of their structure 
and functions. In European countries IEC 61851 is the applicable standard. The components for 
charging the 101 satisfy charging mode 2 (connection to standard household socket with additional 
pilot line) and charging mode 3 (connection to fixed wallbox with pilot line). 

The standard for America is SAE J1772. Charge Level 1 and 2 are comparable to charging 
modes 2 and 3. Most components for charging the 101 only satisfy both standards with one 
technical version. A national-market or standard-specific version is required for Europe and 
America only by the "Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment". 

For the employees in BMW Service the following important safety rules must be observed in relation to 
charging: 

A_ 

Refueling the vehicle while the high-voltage battery is charging is not permitted! 

When the charging cable is inserted do not initiate a refueling procedure and keep a safe distance from 
highly flammable materials. Otherwise, in the event of incorrect connection or removal of the charging 
cable there is a risk of personal injury or material damage by burning fuel for example. 


A___ _ 

While the 101 is connected to the AC voltage network for charging, no work may be performed at the 
high-voltage system. 


A 

During the charging procedure the electric coolant pump and the electric fan can be switched on 
automatically for cooling the power electronics. This is why no work can be performed at the cooling 
system of the electric motor and at the electric fan when a charging cable is connected to the 101.

A_ 

Work at the charging cable, at the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment, at household sockets 
or charging stations can only be performed by qualified electricians, and not by BMW Service 
employees. 


6.1.2. Overview of charging options 

In general, the high-voltage battery can either be charged using alternating current (AC charging) or 
direct current (DC charging). The charging options of the high-voltage battery in the 101 are generally 
specified by the equipment for charging in the vehicle, as well as the national-market charging 
infrastructure. The following table provides an overview of the different charging options in various 
countries. The charging powers always relate to the mains power and not the charging power used to 
charge the high-voltage battery. The charging power is always less than the available mains power.

6.1.4. Charging plug 

The charging plugs used are also standardized (IEC 62196-2). Depending on the vehicle equipment 
and national-market version different charging sockets are used. The following table provides an 
overview of the most frequently used connectors:

6.1.5. Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment 

The EVSE establishes the connection to the AC voltage network and serves for the fulfilment of 
requirements for electrical safety when charging the vehicle. Communication to the vehicle can also be 
set up via the so-called pilot line. As a result, it is possible to safely start the charging procedure and 
exchange the charging parameters (e.g. maximum current level) between vehicle and EVSE. The EVSE 
can either be integrated in the charging cable (mobile solution) or be an element of a fixed charging 
station (also called "wallbox"). 

In both cases the EVSE contains the following subcomponents: 

• Earth leakage circuit breaker (FI) 

• Display whether the AC voltage network is connected and available 

• Electronic disconnect switch for phase (LI) and neutral conductor (N) 

• Electronic switching for generating the pilot signal 

• Continuous protective earth (PE). 


Mobile solution 

The version integrated in the charging cable is also called "In-Cable box" and is designed for 
mobile use. The volume and weight of this solution is low and the charging and EVSE can be easily 
transported in the vehicle.

As a household power socket is used for the connection of this EVSE to the AV voltage network, the 
maximum current level is restricted for charging. A product of this kind offered for the AC voltage 
network in Germany can be used up to a current level of 16 A or up to a charging power of 3.7 kW. The 
duration until a fully discharged high-voltage battery of the 101 is fully charged up again (18.8 kWh net) 
would be roughly 7 hours in optimal conditions.

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 

Employees in BMW Service cannot perform any maintenance or repair work on the charging cable 
or the EVSE. In the event of a defect with or a malfunction of the charging cable or the EVSE, the 
manufacturer must be contacted. 


Fixed charging station 

This version of the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment must be installed permanently owing to its size 
and electrical requirements, e.g. at the house or in the customer's garage. Such a charging station can 
also be built at public places, e.g. car parks. 

A 

The installation, maintenance and repair of fixed charging stations can only be performed by suitably 
qualified electricians. Employees in BMW Service are not authorized to perform this work as they 
generally do not have this training. 


For the fixed charging stations (also called "wallbox") a distinction is made between AC charging 
stations and DC charging stations. 

AC charging stations 

The connection of the AC charging stations to the AC voltage network can be via a two-phase (US 
market) or three-phase (typical in Germany) supply - the connection to the 101 is, however, always 
designed as a single-phase supply. In comparison to the mobile solution, a maximum current level of 
32 A or a maximum charging power of 7.4 kW is possible. These maximum values are, however, still 
dependent on the size of the line cross-section, which was used in the electrical installation at the 
charging site. The electrician configures the charging station during installation according to the line 
cross-section so that the applicable maximum current level is transmitted to the vehicle using the pilot 
signal. 

AC charging stations from other manufacturers or the versions for other countries may differ from the 
versions shown up to now. 

The following graphic shows an AC charging station for the US market.

In the US market a plug connection between the charging cable and AC charging station is 
permanently attached to the charging station (wallbox). Therefore the charging cable cannot be 
separated from the AC charging station by the customer. The connector visible in the graphic is not 
the connector for the connection to the AC charging station, but for the connection to the vehicle, 
which is only stored in the AC charging station. 

DC charging station 


96 










101 High-voltage Components 

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 



The DC charging stations form the second group of the fixed charging stations. In comparison to the 
AC charging station, the AC voltage is already converted to direct current in the DC charging station. 
Therefore, power electronics for the conversion of the AC voltage to direct current voltage in the 
electric vehicle are not required. 


As the weight of the power electronics in the DC charging station plays a minor role, large 
transformers and a rectifier can be installed there to use the full network power. For this reason, DC 
charging stations generally deliver a much higher charging power than AC charging stations. Using a 
DC charging station the high-voltage battery can thus be charged much quicker. 


6.2. AC charging with 3.7 kW (Occasional Use Cable) 

Although the high-voltage battery of the 101 can also be partially charged by brake energy 
regeneration, the "normal" charging procedure takes place when the 101 is connected to the AC 
voltage network of the power supply company. Energy is taken from the AC voltage network and fed to 
the direct current voltage high-voltage electrical system of the 101. 


97 





101 High-voltage Components 

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 

Although AC charging with 3.7 kW is standard equipment in many countries in the US market, it only 
refers to the charging via the occasional use cable (inserted into a normal 110V socket). The big 
advantage of this charging option is that for charging the high-voltage battery the charging cable can 
be connected at any household power socket with protective contact. However, the current level for 
charging is also restricted to a maximum 16 A. The maximum charging power is, for example for supply 
at AC voltage network in Germany, 3680 W (P = U x I = 230 V x 16 A). The total time it takes to fully 
charge a discharged high-voltage battery of the 101 (storable energy: 18.8 kW net) would be about 7 
hours. In order to reduce the use of the maximum charging power for houses, a charging procedure is 
never performed at maximum charge current. Therefore, the actual charging time is longer. 

A_ 

The EME is designed so it can provide a maximum electrical power of 3.7 kW on the output 
side. This is charging configuration is used (in the US market) only when charging with the 
occasional use cable via a household 120 V socket. And it sufficient to fully charge the 101 
high-voltage battery under optimal marginal conditions in about 16 hours.

The charging cable is used to join the following components: 

• Specific national-market connection for household power socket with protective contact 

• Plug connection between specific national-market connector and "In-Cable box" 

• "In-Cable box" (EVSE) 

• Plug connection between "In-Cable box" and connector for vehicle connection 

• Connector for vehicle connection. 

The charging cable is the electrical connection between the AC voltage network and the direct current 
voltage high-voltage electrical system of the vehicle. The connection to the AC voltage network is 
effected at a typical household power socket with protective contact, which does not include Electric 
Vehicle Supply Equipment. In this case the switching and functions of the Electric Vehicle Supply 
Equipment are integrated in the charging cable. This is called an "In-Cable box". This charging cable 
for the 101 is always designed for single-phase supply, in line with the charging socket at the vehicle 
(phase LI and neutral conductor N) and always includes the protective earth PE, as well as the pilot 
and proximity line. The connector is designed so that the connection is first made with the protective 
contact. The ground is grounded via the protective earth. 

The charging cable can be housed in the charging cable compartment under the engine compartment 
lid. 

A_ 

Please consult the operating instructions of the respective manufacturer for the operation and use of a 
charging cable with an integrated EVSE. 

Employees in BMW Service cannot perform any maintenance or repair work on the charging cable 
or the EVSE. In the event of a defect with or a malfunction of the charging cable or the EVSE, the 
manufacturer must be contacted.

Charging with Level 1 (occasional use cable) should take about 15 hrs. in the US market but 
this time varies depending on the on voltage supply and on the vehicle charge settings. 


6.2.3. What must be observed when charging the high-voltage battery unit? 

A 

Filling the fuel tank while the high-voltage battery is charging is not permitted! 


When the charging cable is connected do not fill the fuel tank and keep a safe distance from highly 
flammable materials. Otherwise, in the event of an improper connection or if the charging cable is 
pulled out, there is a risk of personal injury or material damage by burning fuel for example. 

Charging the high-voltage battery using a typical household power socket results in a high continuous 
load on the power socket, which does not occur with other household appliances. Therefore, the 
following information must be observed: 

• Do not use an adapter or extension cable 

• After charging plug the charging plug into the vehicle first and then into the wall 

• Avoid tripping hazards and mechanical loads for charging cables and power sockets 

• Do not insert the charging plug in damaged power sockets 

• Do not use damaged charging cables 

• The charging plug and charging cable may be warm when charging the high-voltage battery. 

If they become too hot, the power socket is not suitable for charging or the charging cable is 
damaged. Stop charging immediately and have the power socket and charging cable checked 
by an electrician

• Only use power sockets protected against moisture and weathering 

• Do not touch contact areas of power sockets with fingers or objects 

• Never repair or modify a charging cable yourself 

• Remove cable on both sides before cleaning. Do not immerse in fluids. 

• Do not go through a car wash during charging 

• Only charge at power sockets checked by an electrician 

• Observe special information in the operating instructions for charging at unknown or unfamiliar 
infrastructure/power sockets. Set the charging current in the vehicle to "low". 


6.2.4. Charging socket at the vehicle 

The charging socket at the 101 is located precisely where the fuel filler neck is located in a 
conventional vehicle with a combustion engine. Just like the fuel filler flap has to be opened in a 
conventional vehicle, the charging socket cover also has to be opened in the 101. Press the charging 
socket cover to operate the release button and unlock the charging socket cover. The actual charging 
socket is then protected against moisture and dirt contamination by another lid. The charging socket 
satisfies the protection class IP5K5. The charging socket cover and the connector assignment are 
shown in the following graphic.

The high-voltage cables of the charging socket are connected to the electrical machine electronics 
(via the KLE in the US market). Phase LI and neutral conductor N are designed as shielded high- 
voltage cables and end with a flat high-voltage connector at the alternating current connection of the 
electrical machine electronics. The pilot line and the proximity line are simple signal lines. These signal 
lines are also shielded and end at a connector in the charging interface module (LIM). The protective 
earth is connected electrically to ground in close proximity to the charging socket. This ensures proper 
grounding. 

A C-shaped fiber-optic conductor runs around the charging socket at the vehicle. With this C-shaped 
fiber-optic conductor it is possible to show the status for charging. The lighting of the fiber-optic 
conductor is effected using two LEDs which are controlled by the LIM.

The charging socket at the vehicle can only be replaced together with the high-voltage cable as one 
unit. 


6.2.5. Charging interface module (LIM) 

The LIM enables communication between the vehicle and charging station. The voltage supply of the 
LIM control unit is effected by terminal 30F. There is a terminating resistor for the PT-CAN in the LIM. 
The LIM can also wake up the control units in the vehicle electrical system when the charging cable is 
connected. There is also a line which runs directly from the LIM control unit to the electrical machine 
electronics. Only when the LIM control unit enables the charging procedure via a signal on this line, 
does the electrical machine electronics start the voltage conversion and thus the charging procedure.

Signals for the display of charging information 


Communication with EVSE via pilot and proximity line 

The pilot line and the proximity line are realized as simple signal lines. These signal lines are shielded 
and end at a connector in the charging interface module LIM. 

Via the proximity line the connection of the charging plug in the charging socket at the vehicle is 
identified, as well as the maximum current carrying capacity of the charging cable determined. In the 
connector of the charging cable there is an ohmic resistor between the proximity connection and the 
protective earth. The LIM applies a measured voltage and calculates which value the resistance in 
the proximity line has. The resistance value specifies which maximum current level is allowed for the 
charging cable used (dependent on the line cross-section). The assignment of resistance - current 
level is specified in the standard IEC 61851. 

The pilot line is required for the determination and transmission of the maximum available charging 
current level. The pilot signal is a bipolar rectangle signal (-12 V to +12 V). The voltage and the duty 
cycle are used for the communication of different statuses between EVSE and 101: 


Electric vehicle is ready to charge (Yes/No) 

Fault present (Yes/No) 

Maximum charge current which can be provided by the AC voltage network.

Coordinating the charging procedure 

The LIM control unit coordinates the start and finish of the charging procedure. 

There are two actions required by the customer at the start of the charging procedure: 

1 Set the start time for charging 

2 Connect the charging cable. 

Using the controller and the menu in the central information display CID the customer can set and 
adjust the start time for charging in the vehicle. The customer has a second range of adjustment with 
the "BMW i Remote app" for the iPhone™. The customer can select to start the charging procedure 
immediately after connecting the charging cable or specify a time at which the charging procedure 
should start.

If the customer connects the charging cable, the LIM control unit wakes up the control units in the 
vehicle electrical system (if they have not already been woken up by another event). The LIM control 
unit uses the wake-up line wired directly to the BDC control unit. Then the LIM control unit checks the 
functional prerequisites for charging and receives information about the conditions relevant for safety 
via the powertrain CAN. 


108 










101 High-voltage Components 

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 

These checks are summarized in the following list: 

• Driving readiness off 

• Driving speed zero 

• Parking lock engaged 

• Charging cable connect (proximity) 

• Communication with Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment OK (pilot) 

• High-voltage system active and trouble-free. 

When all prerequisites for charging are satisfied, the high-voltage power management in the EME 
requests a charging power from the power electronics in the EME and starts the charging procedure. 
The EME control unit sends not only setpoint values for the charging power, but also specifies limit 
values for the maximum charging voltage and the maximum charge current. These values are based on 
the current condition (e.g. state of charge and temperature) of the high-voltage battery and according 
to the power requirement of the rest of the vehicle electrical system (e.g. for climate control). The 
EME control unit cleverly implements these setpoint values, i.e. it takes into consideration not only 
the setpoint values, but other marginal conditions. These include the actual status of the electrical 
machine electronics (fault, temperature), as well as the current level restricted by the AC voltage 
network and the charging cable. 

Only when the communication between the vehicle (LIM) and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment 
has been started successfully via the pilot line, is the voltage applied to the phase LI. This also gives 
further protection for customers and Service employees against the dangers of electricity. 

Activation of the LEDs for displaying the charging status 

A C-shaped fiber-optic conductor runs around the charging socket at the vehicle. With this C-shaped 
fiber-optic conductor it is possible to show the status for charging. At the same time, this fiber-optic 
conductor is used as locator lighting for the charging socket. The lighting of the fiber-optic conductor 
is effected using two LEDs which are controlled by the LIM. 



Locator lighting: 

The locator lighting of the charging socket is used as an 
orientation aid by the driver for the connection and disconnection 
of the charging plug. 

The two LEDs light up in white as soon as the charging socket 
cover has been opened. The locator lighting remains switched on 
as long as the bus systems are active. As soon as a charging plug 
has been identified as correctly connected, the locator lighting is 
switched off and the initialization status is displayed.

Initialization: 

The initialization starts immediately after the correct connection 
of the charging plug. The initialization phase takes up to 10 
seconds. 

The LEDs flash in an orange color at a frequency of 1 Hz. 

After successful initialization the charging of the high-voltage 
battery can be started.

The currently active charging procedure of the high-voltage 
battery is displayed by flashing blue LEDs. The flashing 
frequency is about 1.42 Hz.

frequency of about 2.0 Hz and an interval of about 0.8 seconds 
between the three groups. 


The LEDs for these displays are activated after the charging plug is connected or after unlocking/ 
locking the vehicle for 12 seconds. If during this time the vehicle is unlocked/locked again, the display 
lasts for another 12 seconds.

The charging socket cover is held closed by a spring-activated locking hook. The locking hook is a part

cover is effected using an electric motor. This electric motor is activated by the LIM. The request for 
unlocking/locking the charging socket cover comes from the BDC. 

A microswitch is also installed in the central locking drive. The status of the microswitch (actuated/ 
not actuated) provides information on the status of the charging socket cover (open/closed). In 
rest position, i.e. when the charging socket cover is closed, the microswitch is not actuated. The 
microswitch is actuated when the charging socket cover is open. The microswitch is also actuated 
when the charging socket cover is pressed and held. 

In the event of an electrical fault, e.g. failure of both the charging socket cover and the DC charging 
plug can be unlocked manually.

6.2.6. Power electronics in the (EME) 

The power electronics for the conversion of the AC voltage coming from the charging socket to direct 
current voltage required for charging the high-voltage battery is housed in the electrical machine 
electronics. The AC voltage is fed to the electrical machine electronics via a single-phase supply. The 
input voltage, which can be processed by the electrical machine electronics, may be in the following 
range: 100 V to 240 V, 50 Hz or 60 Hz. 

The power electronics module is a unidirectional AC/DC converter, i.e. a rectifier. 

At the output, which is separated galvanically from the input, the electrical machine electronics 
supplies an electronically adjustable direct current voltage or an electronically adjustable direct current 
flows. The specifications for the output voltage and the output current come from the function "High- 
voltage power management" in the EME control unit. The values are calculated and adjusted by the 
EME so that the high-voltage battery is optimally charged and the other consumers in the 101 are 
supplied with sufficient electrical energy. 

The EME is designed so it can provide a maximum electrical power of 3.7 kW on the output 
side. This is charging configuration is used (in the US market) only when charging with the 
occasional use cable via a household 120V socket. And it sufficient to fully charge the 101 
high-voltage battery under optimal marginal conditions in about 16 hours. 


6.3. AC charging with 7.4 kW 

AC charging with 7.4 kW is standard equipment for the US market (SA 4U8 AC Fast Charging) and it 
is possible via a permanently installed AC charging station (wallbox). In order to deliver the charging 
power of 7.4 kW, the AC charging station must provide 32 A at a phase connection. P = U x I = 230 V x 
32 A = 7360 W = 7.4 kW.

AC charging with 7.4 kW (SA 4U8 AC Fast Charging) is standard equipment for the US market. 


The EVSE is located inside the AC charging station. With this stationary version of the EVSE, the 
time to fully charge a discharged high-voltage battery in the 101 is cut by half, when compared to AC 
charging with 3.7 kW (standard equipment in European vehicles). 

The same components are required for both the AC charging at 7.4 kW (in the US) and for AC charging 
at 3.7 kW (in EU). In order to deliver the additional 3.7 kW of charging power, the 7.4 kW system 
requires a different charging cable and the installation of a convenience charging electronics (KLE). 
These two components are described here in detail.

6.3.2. Charging cable 

This charging cable for the 101 is always designed for single-phase supply, in line with the charging 
socket at the vehicle (phase LI and neutral conductor N) and always includes the protective earth (PE), 
as well as the pilot line. The ground is grounded via the protective earth. Using the pilot line the 
correct connection to the AC voltage network and its maximum available charging current level can 
be identified or transmitted. In the connector an ohmic resistor is also installed between the proximity 
connection and the protective earth. The resistance value specifies which maximum current level 
is allowed for the charging cable used (dependent on the line cross-section). The assignment of 
resistance - current level is specified in the standard IEC 61851. Using the resistance in the proximity 
line the LIM in the vehicle can identify whether the charging cable is properly connected and which 
current level is allowed for this charging cable. The convenience charging electronics applies a 
measured voltage and calculates which value the resistance in the proximity line has. 

The connection with the AC voltage network is done via a fixed charging station, which includes the 
Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment. The appropriate charging cable for this purpose is solely the 
electrical connection between charging station and charging socket at the vehicle. 

The charging cable for AC Charging at 7.4 kW (standard equipment in US) and AC charging 
at 3.7 kW (Standard equipment in Europe) have the same connector for the connection at the 
vehicle. The connectors are only distinguished by their differing resistances in the proximity 
line, appropriate to the current carrying capacity of the charging cable. The following graphic 
shows the structure and the connections of this connector.

The connector of the charging cable and the charging socket in the vehicle are protected against 
direct contact. In addition, the geometry of the contacts is designed so that the following sequence 
results for the connection of the connector with the charging socket: 

1 Proximity line 


2 Protection earth (PE) 

3 Neutral conductor (N), phase LI 


4 Pilot line.

101 High-voltage Components 

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 

Only when the communication between the vehicle (LIM) and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment has 
been started successfully via the pilot line, is the charging voltage applied to the phase LI. This also 
gives further protection for customers and Service employees against the dangers of electricity. 

With this stationary version of the EVSE the lines can transmit up to 7.4 kW. The AC/DC converter 
in the convenience charging electronics (3.7 kW) and in the electrical machine electronics (3.7 kW) 
ensure the conversion of the single-phase AC voltage to the direct current voltage required for 
charging the high-voltage battery. The duration of the full charge of an empty high-voltage battery of 
the 101 can then be reduced to three to four hours. 


6.3.3. Convenience charging electronics 

The convenience charging electronics (KLE) is installed in the rear of the 101, in an area separated from 
the luggage compartment. 



Installation location of the convenience charging electronics 


The main task of the convenience charging electronics (KLE) during AC charging at 7.4 kW is the 
conversion of the AC voltage to direct current voltage. A rectifier switching in the KLE comprising two 
modules completes this task. These power electronics modules are controlled by a control unit, which 
also bears the same name: Convenience charging electronics (KLE). 

The convenience charging electronics is designed so it can provide a maximum electrical power of 
3.7 kW on the output side. Together with the 3.7 kW from the standard power electronics of the EME, 
this is sufficient in the 101 to fully charge the high-voltage battery (at optimal marginal conditions) in 
three to six hours. This short charging time means enhanced comfort for the customer when using the 
101. For this reason, this charging electronics was called "convenience charging electronics". 

The AC voltage is fed to the vehicle or the convenience charging electronics via a single-phase supply. 
The input voltage, which can be processed by the convenience charging electronics, may be in the 
following range: 100 V - 240 V, 50 Hz or 60 Hz. At the output, which is separated galvanically from 
the input, the convenience charging electronics supplies an electronically adjustable direct current 
voltage or an electronically adjustable direct current flows. The specifications for the output voltage 
and the output current come from the function "High-voltage power management" in the EME control 
unit. The values are calculated and adjusted by the KLE so that the high-voltage battery is optimally 
charged and the other consumers in the 101 are supplied with sufficient electrical energy. 


118 







101 High-voltage Components 

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 

Although the convenience charging electronics works at a high degree of efficiency of well over 90%, 
active cooling is required at full performance. For this reason it is integrated in the cooling circuit of the 
electric motor. 

In addition to the voltage conversion and energy provision, the convenience charging electronics also 
assumes safety functions which protect the customer and Service employee from the dangers of 
electricity. Nevertheless, the following applies: 

The convenience charging electronics is a high-voltage component! 

A 

Only qualified Service employees can work on the convenience charging electronics while observing 
the repair instructions. 

Before working on the convenience charging electronics, it is essential to observe the electrical safety 
rules. 

Similar to all high-voltage components, the convenience charging electronics can only be replaced in 
Service if required, it cannot be opened or repairs. 


The manufacturer of the convenience charging electronics is "Meta System". 

Connections 

The connections at the convenience charging electronics can be divided into four categories: 

• Low-voltage connections 

• High-voltage connections 

• Connection for potential compensation line 

• Connections for coolant lines. 

The following graphic shows all connections of the convenience charging electronics:

Low-voltage connections 


The multipolar low-voltage connector at the convenience charging electronics joins the following lines 
and signals: 

• Voltage supply for the KLE control unit (terminal 30B, terminal 30 from the power distribution 
box at the front and ground) 

• Voltage supply via terminal 30C (quick shutdown in the event of an accident) 

• Bus system PT-CAN2 


120 


















101 High-voltage Components 

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 

• Wake-up lines to the BDC control unit and EDME control unit 

• Control line from the LIM, with which the charging procedure is released 

• Inputs and outputs of the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop (KLE control unit evaluates 
the signal). 

The KLE control unit is supplied with voltage via terminal 30 and terminal 30B and has two wake-up 
line outputs. The convenience charging electronics can also wake up the control units in the vehicle 
electrical system when the charging cable is connected. 

Via the bus system PT-CAN2 the KLE control unit receives the request and the control signals 
for charging. There is also a line which is wired directly from the LIM to the convenience charging 
electronics. Only when the LIM enables the charging procedure via a signal on this line, does the 
convenience charging electronics start the voltage conversion and thus the charging procedure. 

The high-voltage connectors of the convenience charging electronics are also integrated in the circuit 
of the high-voltage interlock loop. Via the low-voltage connection the test signal is forwarded to the 
high-voltage interlock loop and to the other high-voltage components. The KLE control unit monitors 
the test signal and interrupts the charging procedure if it is not in the specified range. 

High-voltage connections 

There are three high-voltage connections at the convenience charging electronics to connect the 
high-voltage cables to the charging socket (1 x) and to the electrical machine electronics (2 x). If the 
101 vehicle is equipped with a range extender, the convenience charging electronics has another high- 
voltage connection in order to connect the range extender electrical machine electronics REME.

Connection for potential compensation line 

Similar to all high-voltage components, the housing of the convenience charging electronics must be 
connected electrically to ground. Only then can the automatic monitoring of the isolation resistance 
work properly. Also with the convenience charging electronics, the protective earth of the AC voltage 
network at the charging socket is also connected to ground. Protective earth (PE) and housing of the 
convenience charging electronics must have the same potential, so that any isolation fault can be 
identified on the AV voltage side of the AC/DC converter. The housing of the KLE is connected to the 
Drive module using four screws for this purpose.

A _ 

The charging of the high-voltage battery in the 101 can only be effected if the potential compensation 
line is properly connected to the convenience charging electronics. 


Connections for coolant lines 

The convenience charging electronics is integrated in the cooling circuit of the electric motor. This 
cooling circuit is described in detail in chapter 11 "Cooling the electric motor components". 


6.4. Combined Charging System 

The "Combined Charging System", or combo charging for short, is a charging system for electric 
and plug-in hybrid cars i.a.w. IEC 62196 and supports both AC charging (alternating current) and 
DC charging (direct current). A Phoenix contact was developed in cooperation with the automobile 
manufacturers and is essentially made up of a charging socket on the vehicle side, the so-called inlet, 
and a charging plug, in which the two individual charging plugs are integrated for AC and DC charging. 
Thanks to this universal connector system only one charging socket is required at the vehicle in 
order to cover the various charging options of AC and DC charging. A distinction is made between 
connections of type 1 (for the US market) and type 2 (for the European market). The contacts for the 
DC connection are the same in both versions. Due to the larger DC contacts in comparison to AC 
charging, currents of up to 200 A are possible, whereby Fast charging, for example during transport, 
can be possible. 

In the 101 two versions of the combo charging are offered, depending on the AC charging power: 

• Combo charging at 3.7 kW AC charging power (standard equipment in Europe) 

• Combo charging at 7.4 kW AC charging power (standard equipment in USA) 


A _ 

In US market vehicles option 4U7 DC Fast Charging is offered as optional equipment; this 
option includes the necessary hardware for the Combo charging at 7.4 kW AC charging or DC 
charging.

The charging socket in the vehicle for combo charging includes the sockets for AC charging and the 
socket for DC charging. The advantage of this charging socket configuration is that the customer can 
use both AC charging stations and DC charging stations for charging the high-voltage battery. 

During DC charging an electric arc may form by disconnecting the charging plug during the charging 
procedure. To prevent this the charging plug is locked electromechanically during the charging 
procedure. This way a possible dangerous situation for the user is avoided. An ergonomic handle at 
the charging plug and low connection and disconnection forces enable comfortable operation of the 
connector using only one hand. 

Simultaneous charging via AC and DC is not possible. 


6.4.3. LIM 

The main tasks of the LIM are already described previously in this chapter. Only the additional 
functions and tasks of the LIM for combo charging are described here. A new tasks of the LIM is, for 
example, the activation of the switch contactors in the KLE for DC charging. 

Communication 

Also for combo charging the LIM assumes the communication between the vehicle and the charging 
station. The communication between the vehicle and the charging station is enabled and the charging 
procedure is controlled via the pilot and proximity line. 

Using the proximity line the correct connection of the charging cable at the vehicle is identified and the 
maximum current carrying capacity of the charging cable is measured by the LIM using the resistor in 
the charging cable. 

The high-voltage power management in the EME sends a request to charge the high-voltage battery 
to the LIM via the PT-CAN. The LIM then starts the communication with the charging station via the 
pilot line. The information about charging requirement, charging range and accuracy is exchanged. 
Only after successful communication start is the charging voltage applied to the phase LI or to the 
DC positive wire and ground cable. This also gives further protection for customers and Service 
employees against the dangers of electricity. 

The LIM sends a signal for "Enable charging" for AC charging via the separate line to EME and KLE. 

Activation of the switch contactors in the KLE 


126 








101 High-voltage Components 

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 

For DC charging the LIM closes the two switch contactors in the KLE, thus enabling the shift through 
from the direct current voltage from the DC charging station to the high-voltage battery. The LIM tests 
after every completed DC charging procedure the DC switch contactors so that a switch contactor 
label (switch contactor cannot open the contacts) is identified. A switch contactor label (single or 
double) is identified by the LIM and sent to the EME as a fault code. If during the charging procedure 
no valid pilot signal is identified by the LIM, the LIM must open the DC switch contactors within 
200 ms. 

The direct current voltage applied at the charging socket is measured by the KLE. The measured value 
is then sent to the LIM as an analog signal. The LIM then sends the calculated value via PT-CAN to 
other control units. 

Emergency charging 

If both the high-voltage and the 12V battery are discharged, the emergency charging of the 12V 
battery is automatically started when the charging cable is connected. As the two batteries are 
discharged, there is also no voltage supply of the 12V vehicle electrical system and the LIM is in this 
case initially not working. So that the LIM can start communication with the charging station and thus 
also the charging procedures, a special voltage supply of the LIM is required. The voltage supply for 
the LIM is effected in this case by the pilot line. The energy used by the pilot line is so low that the 
voltage evaluation for the EVSE is not affected. 

In order to identify emergency charging the voltage value of terminal 30F is evaluated. The evaluation 
circuit is located in the LIM. If the voltage value of terminal 30F falls below 6 V and the pilot line is 
correctly connected, the evaluation circuit drags the voltage value on the pilot line to a value of 6 V. 

This voltage value corresponds to the message at the charging station that the vehicle is ready for 
charging. The charging station is thus prompted to apply the vehicle voltage. 

6.4.4. Convenience charging electronics (KLE) 

Convenience charging electronics for combo charging at 7.4 kW AC charging power 

The KLE version installed for combo charging at 7.4 kW AC charging power is responsible for the 
contact of all HV connections and the housing of the two DC switch contactors. 

In this case the KLE has no rectifier switching for the conversion of AC voltage to direct current 
voltage. The conversion of the AC voltage to direct current voltage takes place in the charging station. 
The full power of the AC network is used (all three phases). If all prerequisites for charging the high- 
voltage battery are satisfied, the LIM switches on the two switch contactors in the KLE. The charging 
station then provides the direct current voltage at the output for charging the high-voltage battery. The 
direct current voltage reaches the KLE via the charging socket and the high-voltage cables. The direct 
current voltage is directed via the high-voltage cables to the EME and then finally to the high-voltage 
battery. The high-voltage cables and the switch contactors are designed for an electrical power of up 
to 50 kW.

With the combo charging at 7.4 kW AC charging power the convenience charging electronics can 
convert both the single-phase AC voltage of the AC charging station to direct current voltage, and shift 
through the direct current voltage of the DC charging station for the electrical machine electronics 
and high-voltage battery using the DC switch contactors. The conversion of the AC voltage to the 
direct current voltage required for charging the high-voltage battery is done by the AC/DC converter 
at a maximum power of 3.7 kW. The properties and function of the AC/DC converter were already 


128 






















101 High-voltage Components 

6. Charging the High-voltage Battery 

described in the previous chapter. Together with the standard AC/DC converter in the EME, which also 
provides an output power of 3.7 kW, charging the high-voltage battery in the 101 via the single-phase 
alternating current at 7.4 kW is also possible. 

In this version of the convenience charging electronics two further switch contactors are housed which 
can shift through the direct current voltage of a DC charging station via the EME to the high-voltage 
battery. The function and activation of the switch contactors are described in the previous subchapter. 

At full performance of the AC/DC converter active cooling is required. The convenience charging 
electronics is therefore integrated in the cooling circuit of the electric motor.

7. EKK 


Very high requirements are made of the heating and air-conditioning functions in the 101. On the one 
hand, the passenger compartment must always be at a pleasant temperature for the customer. On 
the other hand, in order to prolong the service life of the high-voltage battery, the high-voltage battery 
must be cooled at high temperatures. 

An EKK is used in the 101. 

The EKK is a high-voltage component! 

A 

Only Service employees who satisfy all the prerequisites are permitted to work on the designated 
high-voltage components: suitable qualifications, compliance with the safety rules, procedure 
following the repair instructions to the letter. 

The diagnosis and repair of the high-voltage components is only allowed in a retail service 
center that has qualified and certified service technicians. These technicians must have 
completed the ST1403b 101 High Voltage Battery and Maintenance instructor led course and 
successfully passed the hands on certification.

improving the acoustic behavior. As the two housings are not connected, there is a separate potential 
compensation line of the housing of the EKK for the rear axle module (not shown in the graphic below).

In the eight-pin signal connector the connections for local interconnect network bus, ground and the

Special silencing in the pressure line provides for further acoustic comfort. The heating and air- 
conditioning is barely audible even when the vehicle is at a standstill. The mechanical disconnection of 
the EKK from the electrical machine also improves the acoustic behavior. 


7.2. Structure of the electric A/C compressor 

When one talks about the EKK, the entire component is meant. The EKK comprises the following 
components: 


132 












101 High-voltage Components 

7. EKK 


• Housing 

• EKK control unit 

• Three-phase current synchronous motor 

• AC inverter 

• Air conditioning compressor. 

These individual components are never replaced separately! The entire EKK is always replaced. At this 
stage the tasks of some components are explained in order to better explain the function of the EKK. 

7.2.1. EKK control unit 

The EKK control unit controls the engine speed of the three-phase motor in the EKK based on the 
requests of the IHKA and reports the operating status back to the IHKA control unit. The EKK control 
unit communicates with the IHKA via the LIN bus. The IHKA is the master control unit for the EKK. 


7.2.2. Three-phase current synchronous motor 

A three-phase synchronous motor is used as the drive for the EKK. The energy is taken from the 
high-voltage battery. The necessary three-phase current is converted in the EKK using an AC inverter 
(DC/AC converter). The three-phase synchronous motor is operated in the engine speed range 
between 860 and 8600 rpm and is infinitely variable. It uses an electrical power of up to 4.5 kW. The 
maximum power is required, for example, at high ambient temperatures, high interior temperatures, 
high temperatures of the high-voltage battery and low air flow of the cooling module. 

7.2.3. AC inverter 

The DC/AC converter converts the direct current voltage into the three-phase alternating current 
that is required to operate the three-phase synchronous motor. The EKK control unit and the DC/ 

AC converter are integrated in the aluminium housing of the EKK and are cooled by the gaseous 
refrigerant flowing past. If the temperature of the DC/AC converter exceeds 125 °C, the high-voltage 
supply is shut off by the EKK control unit. The attempt is made through different measures such as 
speed increase for cooling initially not to allow the temperature to rise so high. The temperature is 
monitored by the electric A/C compressor control unit. If the temperature drops below 112 °C, the 
EKK continues to run. 

The supply voltage for EKK has a voltage range of about 200 V to 410 V. The power is reduced above 
and below this voltage range or the EKK is switched off. 

7.2.4. Air conditioning compressor 

To compress the refrigerant, the spiral compressor (also known as the scroll compressor) is used. 
R134a refrigerant is used for the US market.

Outer disc with spiral profile 


The inner disc with spiral profile is driven via a shaft by the three-phase current synchronous motor

through two openings in the fixed outer disc with spiral profile and compressed and heated by the 
movement of the two discs with spiral profiles. 





0 ° 240 ° 480 ° 720 ° 960 ° 

Principle of refrigerant compression 


After three revolutions, the refrigerant drawn in is compressed and heated and can escape in a 
gaseous state through an opening in the center of the outer disc. From here, gaseous refrigerant 
with high temperature and high pressure escapes via an oil separator at the connection of the A/C 
compressor towards the condenser. The EKK is operated at maximum 8600 rpm and generates a 
maximum operating pressure of about 30 bar.

The high-voltage contacts of the round high-voltage connector for the EKK are protected against

The high-voltage connector of the EKK is not part of the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop. 

The electrical capacity in the EKK is less than 100 pF. This capacity is discharged via a passive resistor 
in the EKK. After the EKK is shut down the voltage falls to below 60 V in less than 5 seconds.

8. Electric Heating 

Due to the high efficiency considerably less heat is emitted from the electrical machine than from 
combustion engines. The heat from the electrical machine can therefore not be used for heating. In 
order to be able to control the interior temperature of the passenger compartment, electric heating is 
installed in the 101. 

The electric heating is a high-voltage component!

conveyed from the heat exchanger to the coolant expansion tank. 

A mixture of water and a new coolant concentrate called "coolant concentrate i3" is used as a coolant. 
The water and coolant concentrate are mixed in the ratio 50:50.

of the heater coils (individually or together) is effected within the electric heating using an electronic 
switch (Power MOSFET).

The current through the individual strands is measured and controlled by the electric heating control 
unit. A current of maximum 20 A flows in a voltage range of 250 V to 400 V. The power is reduced 
above and below this voltage range. At increased power consumption the energy supply by the 
hardware switching is interrupted. This switching is designed so that even in the event of a fault in the 
control unit a power cut is effected safely. 

The temperature of the coolant is measured using a sensor at the output of the electric heating. 

Inside the electric heating a galvanic separation was installed between the high-voltage circuit and the 
low-voltage circuit. 

The connections for local interconnect network bus and voltage supply (terminal 30B) are located at 
the low-voltage connector. 

A bridge is integrated in the high-voltage connector beside the contacts for the high voltage. The 
contacts of the bridge in the high-voltage connector are designed as leading contacts. This means 
when removing the high-voltage connector the contacts of the high-voltage bridge are separated first. 
As a result, the voltage supply of the control unit (EH) is interrupted. This also means the high-voltage 
supply is interrupted before the high-voltage connector is pulled out fully. No electric arc thus arises 
on the high-voltage contacts. The high-voltage contacts are protected from contact. The high-voltage 
connector of the electric heating is not part of the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop. 


8.3. Control system 

Six heating stages can be set through separate or combined activation of the individual heater coils. 
The request for switching on the heating comes from the IHKA control unit via local interconnect 
network bus.

When the maximum temperature is reached or if the maximum permissible current level is exceeded,

9. Range Extender Electrical Machine 

9.1. Introduction 

The high-voltage components examined up to now pave the way for a pure electric driving of the 
101. The electrical machine receives the energy required for the electric motor from the high-voltage 
battery. The EME converts the direct current voltage from the high-voltage battery into 3-phase AC 
voltage. 

The 101 with a pure electric driving is designed so that a distance of about 150 km / 93 mi (115 mi 
using efficiency mode) can be covered before the high-voltage battery must be charged up again. The 
high-voltage battery can also be charged at an earlier stage. 

A101 which is equipped with a range extender can cover a distance of about 300 km /186 mi (200 
mi using efficiency mode) before the high-voltage battery has to be charged or the tank has to be 
refuelled. This means a 101 with range extender offers double the range in comparison to a 101 with a 
purely electric motor. 

Also in the 101 with range extender the electric motor with energy from the high-voltage battery is used 
as a primary drive type. The range extender system is only activated when the state of charge of the 
high-voltage battery falls below a certain value. 

The range extender system consists of the following components: 

• W20 Combustion engine 

• Range extender electrical machine 

• Range Extender Electrical Machine Electronics 

• Range Extender Digital Engine Electronics. 

The W20 combustion engine is a 2-cylinder engine. It is a small, very smooth-running and quiet 
gasoline engine, which is connected mechanically to the range extender electrical machine via a 
geared shaft. At a low state of charge of the high-voltage battery the W20 engine is started using the 
range extender electrical machine. In this case the range extender electrical machine works in engine 
mode. The electrical energy for starting the W20 engine comes from the high-voltage battery. As soon 
as the W20 has been started, the range extender electrical machine changes from engine to alternator 
mode and generates electrical energy which is used for the electric motor of the vehicle via the (main) 
electrical machine. The W20 engine is not connected mechanically to the sprockets. The mechanical 
energy of the W20 engine is converted by the range extender electrical machine solely into electrical 
energy. The (main) electrical machine uses this electrical energy and converts it to mechanical energy 
to drive the rear wheels. The layout of these components corresponds to a serial hybrid car. 

In this chapter the range extender electrical machine is described and in the next chapter details are 
provided on the range extender electrical machine electronics. 

The W20 engine and the engine control of the range extender digital engine electronics are described 
in the product information bulletin "W20 Engine".

9.3. Design 

The range extender electrical machine in the 101 is a synchronous machine. Its general structure and 
operating principle correspond to those of a permanently excited synchronous machine with internal 
rotor: The rotor is located inside and is equipped with permanent magnets. The stator is ring-shaped 
and located outside around the rotor. It is shaped with iron cores through the 3-phase coils. If a 3- 
phase AC voltage is applied to the stator coils, they generate a rotating magnetic field, which "pulls" 
the magnets in the rotor (in engine operation).

9. Range Extender Electrical Machine 

The electrical machine is designed for a large temperature range. The coolant can reach a temperature 
of up to 70 °C (158 °F) at the input (supply) at a flow of six liters per minute. The temperature at 
the input is time-restricted and can rise up to 85 °C (185 °F). And although the electrical machine 
demonstrates less losses during energy conversion than a combustion engine, its housing can absorb 
a temperature of up to 100 °C (212 °F). 

The two connections for the coolant lines integrate the range extender electrical machine in the 
cooling circuit of the electric motor. This is described in the chapter "Cooling of electric motor 
components". The graphics in this chapter show the range extender electrical machine and the W20 
engine without coating. In the production vehicle sometimes these components are still covered by a 
foam part. This serves for the acoustic encapsulation of the range extender components and absorbs 
noises which the customer may find irritating. 

The housing of the range extender electrical machine is airtight and waterproof. A vent line is required 
to prevent water (resulting from temperature changes and thus possible condensation of air humidity) 
collecting inside the range extender electrical machine. 

9.3.2. Sensors 

Temperature sensor 

In order to avoid damage to the components due to the high temperature, there is a temperature 
sensor in the range extender electrical machine of the 101. The temperature sensor is a temperature- 
dependent resistor and is located in the coils of the stator. The temperature of the rotor is not 
measured directly, but can be determined from the measured values of the temperature sensors in 
the stator. The signal is read in and evaluated analogously by the range extender electrical machine 
electronics.

So that the voltages for the coils in the stator can be correctly calculated and generated by the range 
extender electrical machine electronics in terms of amplitude and phase layer, the precise angle 
setting of the rotor must be known. This is why there is also a rotor position sensor in the range 
extender electrical machine. 

The rotor position sensor is secured at the stator of the range extender electrical machine and works 
according to the tilt sensor principle. There are three coils in the rotor position sensor. A defined 
AC voltage is fed to one of the coils. The other two coils are each moved 90°. The voltages induced 
in these coils provide information about the angle setting of the rotor. The rotor position sensor is 
mounted by the manufacturer of the range extender electrical machine at the corresponding alignment 
so that it is already correctly adjusted.

10. REME 


10.1. Introduction 

The main task of the range extender electrical machine electronics is to control the range extender 
electrical machine. It converts the direct current voltage from the high-voltage battery into a three- 
phase AC voltage (up to about 420 V AC) for the activation of the range extender electrical machine as 
an engine. Currents of up to 200 A can flow. Vice versa, when the range extender electrical machine 
works as an alternator, the range extender electrical machine electronics converts the three-phase AC 
voltage of the range extender electrical machine to a direct current voltage and can thus supply the 
energy for the electric motor of the 101. The continuous phase currents of about 130 A flow. For these 
two operating modes a bidirectional DC/AC converter is necessary which can work as both an inverter 
and a rectifier. 

The entire range extender electrical machine electronics of the 101 is located in an aluminium housing. 
This housing accommodates the control unit and the bidirectional DC/AC. 

The range extender electrical machine electronics is a high-voltage component! 

A_ 

Only Service employees who satisfy all the prerequisites are permitted to work on the designated 
high-voltage components: suitable qualifications, compliance with the safety rules, procedure 
following the repair instructions to the letter. 

The diagnosis and repair of the high-voltage components is only allowed in a retail service 
center that has qualified and certified service technicians. These technicians must have 
completed the ST1403b 101 High Voltage Battery and Maintenance instructor led course and 
successfully passed the hands on certification. 


A_ 

The housing of the range extender electrical machine electronics cannot be opened in Service. 


The range extender electrical machine electronics of the 101 was developed and supplied by Bosch. 
The efficiency of the REME is 96%. The weight of the REME is about 6 kg. 


10.2. Installation location and mounting 

The range extender electrical machine electronics is installed in the rear of the 101, in an area 
separated from the luggage compartment.

10. REME 

• Low-voltage connections 

• High-voltage connections 

• Connection for potential compensation line 

• Connections for coolant lines. 

10.3.1. Low-voltage connections 

In the multipolar low-voltage connector at the range extender electrical machine electronics two multi¬ 
core lines with the following signals are combined: 

• Voltage supply for the REME control unit (terminal 30B and ground connection) 

• PT-CAN 2 

• Two lines from the ACSM for the signal for the quick shutdown of the high-voltage system in 
the event of an accident of corresponding severity 

• Wake-up line 

• Input and output of the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop (REME control unit does not 
evaluate the signal) 

• Rotor position sensor of the electrical machine (supply and sensor signals) 

• Signal of the temperature sensor in the stator coils of the electrical machine. 

These lines and signals have relatively low current levels. 

10.3.2. High-voltage connections 

Two high-voltage cables are connected at the REME: 

• 3-phase high-voltage cable from the range extender electrical machine 

• Two-pin high-voltage cable from the KLE.

Two of the three screws are accessible and can be easily slackened. To slacken the third screw the 
bridge of the high-voltage interlock loop must be removed first. Only then is the third screw visible and 
it can be slackened. Separating the bridge of the high-voltage interlock loop causes the high-voltage 
system to shut down. 

The connection of the two-pin line from the REME is dependent on the vehicle equipment.

101 High-voltage Components 

10. REME 


If a convenience charging electronics is installed in the vehicle, the REME is connected via a two-pin 
HV cable and a flat HV connector to the KLE. The KLE is also connected to the EME via a two-pin 
high-voltage cable and a flat high-voltage connector. The 3-phase AC voltage generated by the range 
extender electrical machine is converted by the REME to direct current voltage and fed from the REME 
via the KLE to the EME via the high-voltage cables. The energy required to start the range extender 
combustion engine is provided by the high-voltage battery. The direct current voltage is directed via 
the EME and KLE to the REME by two-pin high-voltage cables. The EME and the KLE do not convert 
this direct current voltage, it is used solely for the contact. With this type of contact (via KLE) only one 
version of the EME (irrespective of the equipment) has to be installed in the 101. 

10.3.3. Connections for coolant lines 

The range extender electrical machine electronics is integrated in the cooling circuit of the 
electric motor. This cooling circuit is described in detail in chapter 11 "Cooling the electric motor 
components". 

10.3.4. Connection for potential compensation line 

The housing of the REME is connected to the rear axle module and thus ground via a potential 
compensation line. The potential compensation line is secured using a screw connection. 


10.4. Structure and functions 

The range extender electrical machine electronics is made up internally of two subcomponents: 
the bidirectional DC/AC converter and the REME control unit. The link capacitors for smoothing the 
voltage and filtering high-frequency parts are also an element of the power electronics switching. It 
performs the following functions with help of the subcomponents mentioned: 

• Control of the electrical machine (engine speed, torque) using DC/AC converter 

• Reading and evaluation of the temperature sensor of the range extender electrical machine 

• Reading and evaluation of the rotor position sensor 

• Contact of the range extender electrical machine 

• Contact of the electrical machine electronics or the convenience charging electronics 

• Communication with other control units 

• Active and passive discharging of the link capacitors to voltages less then 60 V 

• Self-test and diagnostic function 

The power electronics for the activation of the electrical machine are mainly made up of the 
bidirectional DC/AC converter. It is a pulse converter (also called "inverter") with a two-pin DC voltage 
connection and a 3-phase AC voltage connection. This DC/AC converter can work as an inverter and 
conduct electrical energy from the high-voltage battery to the range extender electrical machine when 
it should work as an engine. However, it can also work as a rectifier and transfers electrical energy 
from the range extender electrical machine (via EME or KLE) to the electrical machine or high-voltage 
battery.

The operating mode of the DC/AC converter is defined by the REME control unit. The REME control 
unit receives the setpoint value as an important input variable from the EME control unit. From this 
setpoint value and the current operating condition of the range extender electrical machine (engine 
speed and torque) the REME control unit determines the operating mode of the DC/AC converter, as 
well as the amplitude and frequency of the phase voltages for the range extender electrical machine. 
According to these specifications, the power semiconductors of the DC/AC converter are activated in 
sync. 

In addition to the DC/AC converter, the power electronics also contains current sensors in all three 
phases on the AC voltage side of the DC/AC converter. Using the signals from the current sensors, the 
REME control unit monitors the electrical power which is used in the power electronics and the range 
extender electrical machine and what torque the range extender electrical machine generates. The 
control loop of the range extender electrical machine electronics is closed by the signals of the current 
sensors and the rotor position sensor in the range extender electrical machine. 

The performance data of the range extender electrical machine electronics and the range extender 
electrical machine are coordinated in development. The range extender electrical machine electronics 
is thus able to permanently provide an electrical power of about 23.3 kW (DC power at 4300 rpm). In 
order to avoid overloading the power electronics, there is also another temperature sensor at the DC/ 
AC converter. If an excessive temperature of the power semiconductor is identified using this signal, 
the REME control unit reduces the power delivered to the range extender electrical machine or used 
by the range extender electrical machine in order to protect the power electronics. The customer is 
informed via a Check Control message in the case of a noticeable power reduction. The customer 
receives the same error response (power reduction) and the same Check Control message if the 
temperature of the range extender electrical machine exceeds the permissible range.

11. Cooling the Electrical Machine 

Due?? the high efficiency considerably less heat is emitted from the electrical machines and the 
power electronics than from combustion engines. Nevertheless, in order to ensure fault-free operation 
at all temperature conditions, a cooling system for cooling the electric motor components is necessary 
in the 101. To provide a complete overview the cooling system is shown below with the maximum 
equipment. For vehicles with less equipment, e.g. no range extender or no convenience charging 
electronics, the scope of the components of the cooling system is reduced. 


All circuits are colored for better representation. The blue colors should indicate a lower temperature. 
The red colors indicate a high temperature of the coolant. The different red colors highlight the 
different high temperatures.

The components to be cooled are switched in the cooling circuit so that the maximum temperature 
levels required are observed. A lower temperature is required for the electrical machine electronics 
than for the electrical machine, which is why the series connection in this sequence was chosen. As 
the electric motor and the convenience charging electronics are not operated at the same time, the 
parallel circuit was chosen. The range extender electrical machine and the range extender electrical 
machine electronics are switched initially in series. As these two components are operated at the 
same time as the convenience charging electronics and the electrical machine electronics, they were 
switched in parallel to these. In addition, the cooling system is therefore not designed for the sum of all 
heat outputs, because in reality heat only has to be discharged in one or two of the parallel branches. 

If the vehicle is equipped with a range extender, in the cooling circuit there is a coolant-coolant heat 
exchanger for cooling the W20 engine.

11. Cooling the Electrical Machine 


The ! sffly?db?a0§i?3 has a power of 80 W (Manufacturer: Bosch). The coolant pump is activated 
by the EDME control unit. For this purpose, the coolant pump and the EDME control unit are 
connected via a direct line. The electric coolant pump can be activated at varying power by pulse- 
width modulated signals. The voltage supply of the coolant pump is effected via terminal 30B. The 
installation location of the coolant pump is at the rear right. 


The expansion tank is located in the space below the engine compartment lid on the left. There is 
no electrical level sensor installed in the expansion tank. But there is the following special feature 
to be noted for Service: A loss of coolant, for example due to a leak, in the cooling system is not 
identified directly due to the lack of an electrical level sensor. Instead, in the event of coolant loss 
the temperature of the cooled components (electrical machine, electrical machine electronics, 
convenience charging electronics, range extender and the range extender electrical machine 
electronics) rises above the normal operating range. In this case the power of the electric motor is 
reduced and a corresponding Check Control message is issued. The Service employee must check 
the following fault causes during troubleshooting: 


• Loss of coolant, e.g. by a leak 

• Coolant-air heat exchanger blocked 

• Electric fan does not work or is restricted 

• Coolant pump does not work 

• Coolant lines or connections damaged 

• Components to be cooled faulty (electrical machine, electrical machine electronics, 
convenience charging electronics, range extender electrical machine, range extender electrical 
machine electronics). 


A 

If excess temperature is displayed in the cooling system of the electric motor, then this may have 
several causes, including also the loss of coolant. Therefore, during troubleshooting all components of 
the cooling system must be checked systematically. 


The familiar mixture of water and antifreeze and corrosion inhibitors in BMW vehicles is used as a 
coolant. 

A_ 

When filling the cooling circuit of the electric motor use the special tool for vacuum filling according to 
the repair instructions. 

Perform a bleeding after filling the cooling circuit, as well as after replacing components in the cooling 
circuit. 


For the bleeding the cooling circuit for the electric motor in the 101 follow the same procedure as 
for conventional vehicles. There is a Service function in the diagnosis system for the activation of 
a bleeding procedure. This consists of appropriate activation of the electric coolant pump (varying 
engine speed, defined duration). This bleeding procedure can also be activated without the diagnosis 
system. The following procedural steps must be carried out here: 

1 Connect the charging plug to the vehicle 

2 Switch on terminal 15 (only ignition, no driving readiness)

7 Press and hold down brake pedal at the same time 

8 Press the accelerator pedal for less than 10 seconds (fully) 

9 The bleeding procedure is started. The bleeding procedure takes about 12 minutes. 

A 

Before the high-voltage battery is charged or the 101 is driven, the cooling system of the electric motor 
is filled with coolant and bled. Otherwise, damage may occur to the convenience charging electronics, 
the electrical machine, the electrical machine electronics, the range extender electrical machine or the 
range extender electrical machine electronics. 


11.3. Function 

The coolant in the cooling circuit of the electric motor components is pumped by an electric coolant 
pump (80 W) through the five electric motor components and if necessary the coolant-coolant heat 
exchanger. 

If the air stream is insufficient for cooling the coolant in the radiator, the electric fan is also switched on 
by the EDME. The electric fan has a power rating of 400 W. 

There is only one version of this cooling system, which is used in both the European and US version of 
the vehicle. A variant for cold and hot countries is not offered.

Similar to the cooling systems of current BMW vehicles with combustion engines, the control in the 
101 is also effected depending on the cooling power requirement. This control is integrated in the 
Electrical Digital Motor Electronics (EDME). 

The following input signals are used for the control: 

• Component temperature of electrical machine 

• Component temperature of electrical machine electronics 

• Component temperature of convenience charging electronics 

• Component temperature of range extender electrical machine electronics 

• Component temperature of range extender electrical machine 

• Current power used in the electric motor or convenience charging electronics 

• Driving speed. 

In comparison to the familiar cooling systems of conventional vehicles, the coolant temperature is not 
used as an input variable for the control. Accordingly, there is no coolant temperature sensor in the 
cooling system for the electric motor of the 101. Instead, the electric coolant pump and the electric 
fan are activated according to the listed input variables and also the current cooling requirement. The 
coolant can reach a maximum temperature of about 85 °C/185 °F (return from the electrical machine). 
In comparison to the cooling system for BMW combustion engines, the temperature level is lower. The 
cooling circuit for the range extender has a higher temperature. Therefore, using the coolant-coolant 
heat exchanger the temperature of the coolant in the cooling circuit for the range extender can be 
reduced. Also in the 101 the familiar precautionary measures must be observed before working on the 
cooling system. 

The activation of the coolant pump and electric fan can be effected in the following vehicle conditions: 


169 














101 High-voltage Components 

11. Cooling the Electrical Machine 
Components 

• Terminal 15 switched on, driving readiness 

• Terminal 15 switched on, no driving readiness 

• High-voltage battery is charged. 

The power electronics switching of the electrical machine electronics are already working when 
terminal 15 is switched on. Both the high-voltage electrical system (EKK and electric heating) and the 
12V vehicle electrical system are supplied with energy by the DC/DC converter. If due to the arising 
heat a cooling requirement is identified, the coolant pump is switched on, and if required also the 
electric fan. 

A_ 

When terminal 15 is switched the coolant pump and electric fan can be switched on automatically. 

For work with an open engine compartment lid or at the cooling module it is imperative terminal 15 is 
switched off. 


While the high-voltage battery is being charged, the power electronics in the electrical machine 
electronics and in the convenience charging electronics are working. Due to the high electrical 
power, which is generated in the electrical machine electronics and the convenience charging 
electronics, heat also develops. This must be dissipated using the cooling circuit described here. 

For this reason, the electric coolant pump and the electric fan are also switched on during charging 
with a correspondingly high temperature in the electrical machine electronics and in the convenience 
charging electronics. 

A_ 

The coolant pump and the electric fan can be switched on automatically when charging the 
high-voltage battery. The high-voltage battery cannot be charged when working with the engine 
compartment lid open or at the cooling module.

12. Technical Safety Precautions 

12.1. High voltage interlock loop 

The high-voltage interlock loop is used to protect individuals when working on or at the high-voltage 
components. Via the high-voltage interlock loop it is identified whether one or several high-voltage 
plug connections have been disconnected. If a high-voltage plug connection has been disconnected, 
the entire high-voltage system is shut down automatically. A square wave signal with alternating 
current direction is sent through the line of the high-voltage interlock loop by the battery management 
electronics SME. The SME and the electrical machine electronics EME evaluate this signal. 

The line of the high-voltage interlock loop runs through each connector/plug of the high-voltage 
components, which are able to generate high voltage.

12.2. Starting and shutting down the high-voltage system 

The master control unit for the control of the high-voltage system is the electrical machine electronics. 

12.2.1. Starting 

The sequence for starting the high-voltage system is always the same irrespective of which of the 
following events was the trigger: 

• Terminal 15 is switched on or driving readiness is established 

• Charging the high-voltage battery should start 

• "Preparation" of the vehicle for the journey (climate control of the high-voltage battery or the 
passenger compartment). 


The individual steps for starting the high-voltage system are: 

1 EME control unit requests starting via bus signal at the PT-CAN and PT-CAN2 

2 The high-voltage electrical system is checked using self-diagnosis functions 


173 












101 High-voltage Components 

12. Technical Safety Precautions 


3 The voltage in the high-voltage circuit is increased continuously 

4 The contacts of the switch contactors are fully closed. 

The high-voltage electrical system is mainly checked by the EME control unit and the SME control 
unit. Criteria relevant for safety, for example the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop or the isolation 
resistance, are checked. Functional preconditions such as the operating readiness of all subsystems 
must also be fulfilled for starting. 

As the high-voltage circuit capacitors have high capacity values (link capacitors in the power 
electronics), the contacts of the electromechanical switch contactors cannot be easily closed. 
Extremely high current pulses would damage both the high-voltage battery and the link capacitors 
and the contacts of the switch contactors. First of all, the switch contactor of the ground cable in the 
high-voltage battery is closed. In order to restrict the switch-on current, there is a current path with 
resistance in the positive wire (connected parallel to the switch contactor). This is now activated and 
a switch-on current restricted by the resistance charges the link capacitors. If the voltage of the link 
capacitors has reached the approximate value of the battery voltage, the last contact of the switch 
contactor at the positive terminal of the high-voltage battery unit is closed. The high-voltage system is 
now fully operational. 

If there is no fault in the high-voltage system, the entire starting of the high-voltage system is 
completed in about 0.5 seconds. There is thus no disadvantage for the customer in comparison to 
vehicles with a conventional engine. 

The SME control unit communicates successful starting via the PT-CAN2 to the EME control unit. 
Fault statuses are also communicated in the same way, if, for example, a contact of a switch contactor 
was unable to be closed. 


12.2.2. Shutting off the high-voltage system 

When it comes to shutting off the high-voltage system a distinction is made between regular shut¬ 
off and fast shut-off. The regular shutdown described here protects all respective components on the 
one hand, and, on the other hand, includes the monitoring of components of the high-voltage system 
which are relevant for safety. 

Regular shutdown 

If the following preconditions or criteria are present, the high-voltage system is shutdown in the regular 
manner: 


• Terminal 15 is switched off by the driver and the after-running period is expired (controlled by 
EME) 

• End of the functions "stationary cooling", "auxiliary heater" or "conditioning of the high- 
voltage battery" 

• End of the charging procedure for the high-voltage battery. 

The sequence for the regular shutdown is generally the same irrespective of the trigger. The individual 
steps are: 

1 EME orders the shutdown after the after-running period has expired via bus signals at the PT- 
CAN/PT-CAN2 


174 



101 High-voltage Components 

12. Technical Safety Precautions 


2 The systems at the high-voltage electrical system (EME, REME, KLE, EKK, EH) reduce the 
currents in the high-voltage electrical system to zero 

3 Opening the switch contactors in the high-voltage battery unit (controlled by SME) 

4 Discharging the high-voltage circuit, i.e. active discharging of the link capacitors (EME, REME and 
KLE), short-circuit of the coils of the electrical machine (EME and REME), short-circuit of the coils 
of the EKK 

5 Checking the high-voltage system, e.g. as to whether the contacts of the electromechanical 
switch contactors were correctly opened. 

Both the after-running period after switching off terminal 15 and the shutdown itself can last a few 
minutes. The automatic monitoring functions are a reason for this, for example. The regular shutdown 
is interrupted if in the meantime either a request for a renewed start-up is made or a condition has 
arisen to request a quick shutdown. 

Quick shutdown 

The overriding aim here is to shut down the high-voltage system as quickly as possible. This quick 
shutdown is then always carried out if for safety reasons the voltage in the high-voltage system has to 
be reduced to a safe value as quickly as possible. The following list describes the triggering conditions 
and the functional chain leading to the quick shutdown. 

• Accident: 

ACSM identifies an accident. Depending on the severity of the accident the shutdown of the 
high-voltage system is requested via bus signals. The SME triggers the separation of the 
switch contactors in the high-voltage battery. In the case where communication via a data bus 
is faulty or not possible, the switch-off of the switch contactors is forced (hard opening). The 
switch contactors are supplied with voltage by terminal 30C. Through the separation of the 
safety battery terminal from the positive terminal of the 12V battery, the voltage supply of the 
switch contactors is also interrupted and their contacts open automatically. 

The EME and the REME also receive bus signals for switching off the high-voltage system. 
Both control units immediately trigger the active short circuit of the electrical machines (short- 
circuit of the coils of the corresponding electrical machine via the power semiconductor of the 
AC/DC converter) and the active link capacitors are discharged. If communication via the data 
bus is not possible, the shutdown request is sent via the separate lines between ASCM and 
EME, as well as between ACSM and REME. 

• Overload current monitoring: 

With help of current sensors in the high-voltage battery unit the current level in the high- 
voltage electrical system is monitored. If too high a current level is identified, the SME control 
unit causes a hard opening of the electromechanical switch contactors. Considerable wear 
occurs to the contacts of the switch contactors as a result of this opening under a high 
current, which must be accepted to protect the other components from damage. 

• Protection in the event of a short circuit: 

In the high-voltage battery unit there is an overload current fuse which interrupts the high- 
voltage circuit in the event of a short circuit. 

• Critical cell state: 


175 



101 High-voltage Components 

12. Technical Safety Precautions 

If a cell supervision circuit identifies extreme under-voltage, over-voltage or excess 
temperature at a battery cell, this also leads to a hard opening of the electromechanical switch 
contactors - controlled by the SME control unit. Although this may lead again to increased 
wear at the contacts, this quick shutdown is necessary to prevent destroying the respective 
battery cells. 

• Malfunction of the 12V voltage supply of the high-voltage battery unit: 

In this case the battery management electronics control unit no longer works and it 
is no longer possible to monitor the battery cells. For this reason the contacts of the 
electromechanical switch contactors also open here automatically. 


12.2.3. Charging the high-voltage battery 

The SME control unit also plays an important role in the charging of the high-voltage battery with 
energy supply from an external power network. Using the state of charge and the temperature of 
the battery cells, the SME control unit defines the maximum electrical power which the high-voltage 
battery can currently use. This value is transmitted in the form of a bus signal via the PT-CAN2 to the 
EME control unit. The "High-voltage power management" function coordinates the individual power 
requirements and forwards the total value to the electrical machine electronics (and from there to the 
convenience charging electronics). 

During charging the SME control unit constantly identifies the state of charge already reached and 
monitors all sensor signals of the high-voltage battery. In order to ensure optimal progress of the 
charging procedure, the SME control unit constantly calculates current values for the maximum 
charging power based on these values and communicates these to the EME control unit. The heating/ 
cooling system of the high-voltage battery is also continuously controlled by the SME control unit 
during the charging procedure which contributes to a quick and efficient charging procedure. 


12.3. Pinpointing isolation faults 

The SME control unit reliably identifies when the isolation resistance in the high-voltage electrical 
system drops below the specified values. A fault code entry, a Check Control message and, if required, 
the shutdown of the high-voltage system, are automatically effected. The isolation monitoring in the 
SME control unit alone cannot determine the actual location of the fault in the high-voltage electrical 
system. Instead, an isolation fault must be pinpointed by using a test schedule in the diagnosis system. 
Several systematic test steps are required in order to determine the components or the high-voltage 
cable causing the isolation fault. 


12.4. Start-up of the high-voltage system 

If in the event of a repair high-voltage components are removed or replaced, it is imperative to ensure 
that 


• all high-voltage connectors 

• all potential compensation lines and connections for potential compensation 

• all signal connectors 

• all coolant or refrigerant lines and 

• all mechanical connections are properly connected. 


176 




101 High-voltage Components 

12. Technical Safety Precautions 

The cooling or refrigerant system must also be filled with coolant or refrigerant. 

A 

If the above-mentioned preconditions are not satisfied, the high-voltage system cannot be operated.

13. Operating Strategy 

The operating strategy has the task of maximizing the service life of the high-voltage battery and 
protecting it against damage during operation. All customer requirements when driving and during 
charging should also be fulfilled. The behavior of the electric motor in the event of a fault is also an 
element of the operating strategy. The EDME is the master control unit for the operating strategy. 


13.1. Operating strategy with pure electric drive 

The 101 is designed as a vehicle with a pure electric drive for urban mobility. The high-voltage battery 
and the electrical machine deliver impressive vehicle performances: 

• Range > 160 km (at 20 °C) /100 mi (at 68 °F) 

• Maximum speed 150 km/h/ 93 mph (short-term, 3 minutes) or 120 km/h/74.5 mph 
(continuous) 

• Acceleration from 0-100 km/h in 7.2 s 

Before a drive torque is applied, the EDME must check whether the driving readiness is established. 
The EDME also queries whether all subsystems of the electrical drive train are functioning trouble- 
free, which is also a prerequisite for the provision of a drive torque. Finally, the EDME still has to 
consider the available electrical power for the electric motor which is primarily determined by the 
condition of the high-voltage battery. The SME control unit communicates this condition to the EDME 
control unit via corresponding bus signals. As a result of these checks the EDME identifies whether 
and in what scope the drive torque can be provided. In the case of fault statuses or in the event of 
limited availability, the EDME issues an appropriate Check Control message via the instrument cluster. 

The statuses of the operating strategy relevant for the customer and the Service employee are listed 
below and described briefly.

In the diagram the relative and the absolute state of charge values (SOC values) of the high-voltage 
battery are shown. The absolute values correspond to the actual state of charge of the high-voltage 
battery. The relative SOC values are the values which are displayed to the driver in the instrument 
cluster or in the central information display. In range "A" driving without power restriction and full 
functionality of the convenience functions are available. If the SOC value of the high-voltage battery 
approaches about 5%, the Check Control messages for ranges between 20 km and 10 km are issued. 

In range "B" the performance of the drive train is reduced due to the low state of charge of the high- 
voltage battery. The heating and air-conditioning system is switched off here. 

If the absolute SOC value falls below 10%, driving the vehicle is no longer possible. The reserve of 
10% is required to give the customer adequate time to charge the high-voltage battery and prevent 
deep discharge. 

The driver has the option to extend the range by activating ECO PRO or ECO PRO + mode. Here the 
power of some electrical consumers is reduced or the consumers are switched off completely. In ECO 
PRO mode the maximum speed is 130 km/h (can be adjusted in ECO PRO menu from 80 km/h to 
130 km/h). In ECO PRO + mode the maximum driving speed is restricted to 90 km/h.

13.2. Operating strategy for vehicles with range extender 

Using the optional range extender it is possible to extend the range of the 101. The W20 combustion 
engine drives the range extender electrical machine, whereby electrical energy is generated. This 
electrical energy flows directly to the electric motor/electrical machine or to the high-voltage battery 
depending on the driving requirement (the EME decides the flow). The aim is to keep the state of 
charge (SOC) at a constant level.

Up to a state of charge of the high-voltage battery of 6.5% relative (displayed SOC) a 101 with REX 
behaves in exactly the same way as a 101 with a pure electric motor. 

If the state of charge of the high-voltage battery drops below 6.5% relative, the REX combustion 
engine is started automatically. The automatic engine start-stop function is active up to a state of 
charge of 3.5%. Driving without restrictions is possible for the state of charge between 3.5% and 
1.9%, but without automatic engine start-stop function. Only when the state of charge of the high- 
voltage battery falls below 1.9%, does the driving with restricted drive power takes effect. At a state of 
charge of 0.4% a warning message with range of one kilometer is issued. Driving is no longer possible 
below this SOC value. In the high-voltage battery there is an energy reserve so that it is possible to 
restart the REX combustion engine or so that the high-voltage battery does not discharge fully over an 
extended period. 

After refueling the 101 with REX driving without restrictions is again possible.
