All bus systems in the 101 are known from the other F-series. 

There is no MOST in the 101. 


1.2. Main bus systems 


1.2.1. K-CAN 

In the 101 the following K-CAN are used: 

• K-CAN2 

• K-CAN3 

• K-CAN4. 

All K-CAN data buses have a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s.

The CAN-Buses are shown in the overview of the bus systems. The actual physical layout (topology) is 
shown using the example of the K-CAN3. 

As with most bus systems terminating resistors are also used for termination for the K-CAN to avoid 
reflections on the data lines. 

The terminating resistors for the termination are located in the 

• Body Domain Controller 

• and CAN terminator. 

All other control units are connected at the CAN terminator without a terminating resistor. 

CAN terminator 

In the CAN terminator the terminating resistor for the corresponding CAN-Bus is installed. The 
terminating resistor comprises two resistances connected in series, each 60 Ohm. A measuring 
tap against ground with a resistor and capacitor for the reduction of high-frequency faults is also 
installed. Ferrite beads are installed for all bus lines in the CAN terminator. Ferrite beads suppress 
high-frequency faults on the CAN data lines, thus making possible line lengths of up to 5 m in the 
wiring harness. 


1.2.2. PT-CAN 

In the 101 the following PT-CAN are used: 

• PT-CAN 

• PT-CAN2. 

The gateway for the PT-CAN2 is located in the Electrical Digital Motor Electronics (EDME). 
Both PT-CAN data buses have a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s.

The FlexRay is shown in a simplified form in the overview of the bus systems. The FlexRay system 
wiring diagram shows the actual physical layout (topology). 

The FlexRay has a data transfer rate of 10 MBit/s. 

The control units at the FlexRay are: 

• connected using an additional line at terminal 15WUP 

• or terminal 15N. 


FlexRay data bus topology for the 101 

The star coupler with four drivers is located in the Body Domain Controller (BDC). The FlexRay control 
units are connected to these bus drivers independent of their termination type. 

Bus termination 

As with most bus systems resistors are also used for termination for the FlexRay to avoid reflections 
on the data lines at both ends of the data lines. The terminating resistors are located in the control 
units. If only one control unit is connected at a bus driver, the connections at the bus driver and at the 
control unit also have a terminating resistor. 

Synchronization 

In order to realize the synchronous design of individual functions in networked control units, a 
common time base is required. As all control units work internally with their own clock generator, 
the time synchronization must be done via the data bus. The control units measure the period of 
certain synchronization bits, calculate the mean value and adapt their bus cycle to this value. The 
synchronization bits are sent in the static part of the bus message. The synchronization starts in the 
FlexRay after the system start between two control units that are authorised to perform wake-up 
function (marked with "S" in the bus overview), once the Body Domain Controller has sent a wake- 
up pulse. When this process is completed, the other control units log on at the FlexRay and calculate 
their respective difference value. In addition, a mathematical correction of the synchronization is 
done during operation. It is thus guaranteed that even the slightest time differences do not lead to 
transmission errors over a longer period. 


1.2.4. D-CAN 

The D-CAN for the vehicle diagnosis has a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s.

2.3.1. Battery 

For the voltage supply of the 12V vehicle electrical system a 20 Ah AGM battery is used. 


38 













101 General Vehicle Electronics 

2. Voltage Supply 

In contrast to a vehicle with a combustion engine, the requirements of the 12V battery in the 101 
with regard to an engine start are different. In the 101 the job of the 12V battery is only to ensure the 
powering up of the high-voltage system. What is required of the 12V battery is no longer a minimum 
SoC to ensure engine starting, but rather a minimum SoC to protect the 12V battery against freezing 
at temperatures below 0 °C and to power up the high-voltage system. 

The voltage supply of the 12V vehicle electrical system (and also the charging of the 12V battery) is 
not provide by the conventional alternator, but via the DC/DC converter in the EME. 

2.3.2. Intelligent battery sensor (IBS) 

The IBS records the following data of the 12V battery: 

• Voltage 

• Current 

• Pole temperature. 

The IBS performs the calculation and the evaluation of the information. The results are then forwarded 
to the superior control units via local interconnect network bus (EDME and BDC). 

2.3.3. Safety battery terminal (SBK) 

The safety battery terminal (SBK) is activated in the event of an accident of corresponding severity. 
The following lines are separated: 

• Battery positive wire for the electrical machine electronics (EME) 

• Battery positive wire for the integrated supply module (in vehicles with range extender) 

• Terminal 30C for battery management electronics (SME). 


Terminal 30C (crash message) 

In the event of a missing signal from terminal 30C, the SME performs a quick shut-down of the high- 
voltage system. 

The line from the safety battery terminal to the battery management electronics is shown in the 
wiring diagram. The high-voltage safety connector is located in this line. In a vehicle with the optional 
equipment convenience charging electronics there is another junction for the convenience charging 
electronics (KLE).

Other ground connections can also be located at the Drive module corresponding to the vehicle 
equipment and national-market version. 

In the 101 the ground connections for the consumers cannot be connected to the body because of the 
use of carbon for the Life module. The grounding cables of all consumers are connected to ground 
support points. 

The ground support points are located: 

• Directly at the ground for the Drive module 

• In the case of the Life module via a ground cable at a ground distribution block, which in turn is 
connected to the Drive module. 


Electrical characteristics of carbon 

Carbon is used for the industrial manufacturing of carbon fibers. If these carbon fibers are also 
introduced to a resin, carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, which is also referred to as CFRP, is obtained. For 
the sake of simplicity, this product is referred to as "carbon" in this document. 

A differentiation is made between short fibers (0.1 - 1 mm long), long fibers (1 - 50 mm long) and 
endless fibers (> 50 mm long). The fibers are used for different processing technologies, according to 
their length. 

The short and long fibers are suitable for fiber spraying. During this process, the fibers are sprayed 
with a resin in a form. Endless fibers are processed further to obtain rovings (bundles), or other semi¬ 
finished textile products such as woven fabrics. 

The resin fixes the carbon fibers in the required arrangement and transmits the applied forces to and 
between the fibers. The material carbon ultimately only exists once the carbon fibers are introduced 
into the resin.

Explanation

Carbon fiber 

2 

Resin 


The electrical and thermal conductivity of the carbon fibers themselves is extremely good. However, as 
soon as they are introduced into the resin, the resin defines the conductivity properties. The electrical 
and thermal conductivity is then extremely low as the carbon fibers are encased in resin. The carbon 
fibers are not covered entirely in resin, but can also be exposed at the component surface. 

The passenger compartment made from carbon is connected to the aluminium frame. The aluminium 
frame is connected to ground. As the carbon fibers establish contact with this aluminium frame, the 
passenger compartment has an undefined potential similar to ground. 

A 

If the insulation of a live electrical line becomes damaged as a result of an incident, such as: 

• Accident 

• Crushed cable 

• Improper repair 

and if the electrical conductor touches the carbon passenger compartment, a current may flow 
through the carbon fiber depending on the circumstances. 


With a vehicle voltage of 12 V the current level is in the range of a few amperes. This means a fuse 
installed for the protection of the electrical line would not activate under certain circumstances. 

The current flow through the carbon fibers would also cause a thermal event at the contact points for 
the carbon fibers. Due to the good thermal conductivity this thermal event would also spread to other 
parts/components in the event of continued current flow. The resulting gases are harmful and have an 
unpleasant odor. 

A_ 

Exercise extreme caution when working on electrical lines. 

Lines or connectors which are not insulated cannot touch the carbon body components. 

In each case follow the general and special information on electrical characteristics of the carbon body 
in the repair instructions!

and then presses the START-STOP button, the drive position "N" remains engaged and terminal 15 
remains switched on. 


2.5. Energy management 

Functions such as the seat heating or heated rear window require lots of energy and reduce the range 
of the vehicle. 

The driving programs ECO PRO and ECO PRO+ support the energy-saving consumption of 
convenience functions. They automatically perform a partial or complete deactivation of these 
functions. 

ECO PRO 

• Reduction of the heater output or the switched-on period of the exterior mirror, rear window 
and seat heating. 

• Reduction of the cooling power or heater output of the heating and air-conditioning system. 

• Restriction of the speed to an adjustable maximum value between 90 and 130 km/h. The 
speed limit can be deliberately exceeded by pressing the accelerator. 

ECO PRO+ 

The following settings are also performed upon activation of ECO PRO +: 

• Deactivation of the cooling power and heater output of the heating and air-conditioning 
system. Restricted to de-misting windshield. 

• Deactivation of the seat heating. 

• Restriction of the speed to a maximum value of 90 km/h. The speed limit can be deliberately 
exceeded by pressing the accelerator pedal.

2.6. Emergency charging 

It is not possible to operate the vehicle if the high-voltage battery and 12V battery are not charged. 

In order to put the vehicle back into operation, the charging cable for charging the high-voltage battery 
must be connected. If necessary manually unlock the charging socket cover and connect the charging 
cable. Emergency charging is started automatically. The charging status is not displayed. 

The 12V battery is charged somewhat after a few minutes. The 12V vehicle electrical system is ready 
for operation again. The high-voltage system can be started, the high-voltage battery can therefore be 
charged. The charging status of the high-voltage battery can be displayed again. Continue to charge 
the vehicle until the state of charge for the desired range is reached. 

An additional AC/DC converter is located in the electrical machine electronics (EME) for the 
emergency charging function. This supplies the electronics of the EME if the 12V battery is 
discharged, thus enabling the start-up of the high-voltage system. With an active high-voltage system 
the 12V battery is charged using the DC/DC converter in the EME by the high-voltage battery. 


2.7. Diagnosis and programming 

So that the high-voltage and the 12V battery are not discharged during diagnosis and programming, 
these have to be charged accordingly. The procedure for charging is different during diagnosis and 
programming. 

2.7.1. Diagnosis 

For diagnosis work at the vehicle the high-voltage battery can be charged using a charging cable. 
With terminal 15 switched on the 12V vehicle electrical system is supplied with power via the DC/DC 
converter and the 12V battery charged. 

2.7.2. Programming 

During programming the 12V battery must be charged using an external 12V charger. 

It is not possible to charge the high-voltage battery via the 12V vehicle electrical system. During 
programming the high-voltage system is switched off if necessary.

5. Wash/wipe System 

The 101 is equipped with two windshield wipers and a rear wiper. 

Similar to other BMW models, the following wiper functions are possible: 

• Intermittent wipes 

• Continuous wipe in interval stage 1 

• Continuous wipe in interval stage 2 

• Flick wipes. 

Available as optional equipment for the 101: 

• Wiper nozzle heating (standard) 

• Automatic function via rain-light-solar-condensation sensor. 

5.1. System components 

The 101 uses (for the first time) a windshield wiper system which works in the opposite direction. 
This takes up significantly less space than a wiper system which mechanism operates in the same 
direction.

^he local interconnect network bus connection for the BDC is always established for the wiper motor 
on the driver's side (Master Control Unit). A101 with left-hand drive is shown here. 


5.3. System components 

In the 101 a wiper motor with integrated control unit electronics including two Local Interconnect 
Network interfaces is used. The wipe request and driving speed is transmitted to the control unit of the 
wiper motor on the driver's side (master) via Local Interconnect Network by the BDC. Via another local 
interconnect network bus the master control unit then activates the control unit of the wiper motor on 
the passenger's side. 

The wiper motor is a 12 V reverse motor with a transmission. The control unit, the wiper motor and the 
transmission form one replaceable unit. This wiper motor unit comprises: 

• A permanently excited direct current motor with attached reduction gear 

• Control unit electronics with eccentric shaft sensor and suppressor components with 
attached plug connection. 

The control unit in the wiper motor is able to identify the following faults: 

• Faults in the control unit electronics 

• Short circuits at the motor and sensor system 

• Open lines at the motor and sensor system. 

The control unit in the wiper motor does not have a fault memory. The fault code entry is done in the 
Body Domain Controller.

6.3. Overview of functions 

There is no insertion slot installed in the 101. The vehicle can already be started without a key as 
standard. This function is called "Passive Go" (drive authorization). However, to gain access to the 
vehicle, it is still necessary to actuate the ID transmitter. 

The following locking and security functions are integrated in the 101 in the Body Domain Controller: 

• Comfort Access 

The optional equipment Comfort Access contains the "Comfort Entry" and "Comfort Exit" 
functions. The "Passive Go" function comes as standard. 

• Central locking system 

• Power window regulators 

• Sliding/tilting sunroof 

• Terminal control 

• Electronic immobilizer. 

The locking and security functions of the 101 are based on the CAS functions in the F01 and are 
described in the "Car Access System F01/F02" training material. 

With regard to start enable by the electronic immobilizer (also called Challenge Response), some 
changes have been made from the F01. What is new is the omission of the CAS bus, because PT-CAN 
and FlexRay already provide redundancy of data transfer between BDC and EDME. 

In addition to the transmission release in the control unit GWS in the 101 there is also a release of 
the steering via the Electronic Power Steering. The emergency-start function by stopping the ID 
transmitter at the ring aerial is already known from the F01. 


6.4. Central locking system 

The function of the central locking system of the 101 is based on that of current BMW models. With the 
introduction of the BDC all relevant functions for the central locking system are handled by one control 
unit. The function is as follows: 

The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the remote control receiver. 

The signal causes the BDC to activate the central locking system and the interior lighting. 


70 







101 General Vehicle Electronics 

6. Locking and Security Functions 

The BDC evaluates the status of all door contacts. In this way, for example, the vehicle can be 
prevented from being locked while the driver's door is open. 

The status of the central locking system button is also evaluated by the BDC. The BDC activates the 
central locking system, depending on the status. 

The BDC is responsible for the status recording and activation of the central locking system in the 
tailgate. 

The activation of the unlocking of the engine compartment lid is also the responsibility of the BDC. 

The activation of the unlocking of the fuel filler flap in vehicles with range extender is done by the 
hybrid pressure refueling electronic control unit TFE and not by the central locking system.

The engine compartment lid of the 101 can be unlocked from the passenger compartment using a 
button at the A-pillar and using the ID transmitter. In each case the unlocking is done electrically. The 
engine compartment lid can be unlocked in the event of a fault using the emergency release. 

A microswitch in the engine compartment lid catch identifies the completely closed engine 
compartment lid. 

During the journey the unlocking of the engine compartment lid is blocked. If the engine compartment 
lid was unlocked electrically, the retaining hook, as known from other BMW vehicles, must be unlocked 
from the hook position.
