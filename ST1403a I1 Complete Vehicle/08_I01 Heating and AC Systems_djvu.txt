4.1. Prioritized air recirculation function 

In the BMW 101 for the first time the air recirculation function is prioritized in order to keep the energy 
consumption as low as possible when heating and cooling the air passenger compartment. 

This means that a comfortable interior temperature for the occupants is maintained using less energy. 
Constant control of the fresh air temperature is not required or can be reduced. 


4.2. Intake plenum and water separation 

The housing for the intake plenum is attached at the bulkhead for the passenger compartment. The 
following graphics show the flow which the fresh air takes to the passenger compartment and how the 
water of the fresh air drawn in during rainfall is separated.

The newly developed connection for the refrigerant line, is an axial sealing ring seat with a flat design, 
the sealing ring or EPDM, is pressed onto a smooth surface on the opposite side with the surface 
of a guide ring. Excellent sealing and precise fit are guaranteed with a guide pin and a larger sealing 
surface.

During disassembly ensure that no sharp-edged tools are used to separate the connection. 
The sealing surfaces can be damaged very easily and the replacement of a line may be very 
costly and time-consuming depending on the section. For proper installation new, dry and 
clean sealing rings must be used.

To guarantee occupational safety, it is necessary to wear suitable personal protective equipment 
based on a risk assessment such as long-sleeve work attire, leather gloves and goggles. 

In order to avoid an ignitable atmosphere care must be taken to ensure there is always sufficient 
ventilation. 


4.5. Refrigerant oil 

The new refrigerant oil designed for the EKK must satisfy special requirements. Due to the EKK it 
must have a higher isolation resistance and thus have an inferior electrical conductivity than a standard 
refrigerant oil. It is approved for refrigerant circuits with R1234yf (not for USA) and R134a (USA) 
refrigerant, in which an EKK is used. 

The designation for the refrigerant oil to be used is "Sanden SP-A2". 

The new refrigerant oil cannot be mixed with the R134a refrigerant oil which has been used up to now. 

BMW i service workshops in markets which supply the 112 with the refrigerant R134a and do not use 
a separate A/C service station, have the option to introduce the refrigerant oil by means of an injection 
into the refrigerant circuit. This prevents contamination of the A/C service station. Information on the 
precise procedure and the necessary special tool can be found in the current repair instructions. 

A__ 

Too much refrigerant oil in the refrigerant circuit can cause the system to switch off. Too little oil may 
cause damage to the mechanical components of the heating and air-conditioning system.

4.6. Heating circuit for 101 with range extender 

The passenger compartment is heated using electric heating by a heater circuit filled with coolant. The 
electric heating is supplied with energy via the high-voltage system. 

Cooling circuit for electric heating 

The coolant is drawn in from the expansion tank by the electric coolant pump and pumped to the 
electric heating. In the electric heating the coolant is heated to the desired customer temperature and 
conveyed further to the heat exchanger in the passenger compartment. The heat exchanger installed 
in the heating and air-conditioning unit conveys the heat from the flowing coolant to the air flowing 
through. Then the coolant flows back to the expansion tank, whereby the cooling circuit closes. 

Note: Use special "Coolant concentrate i3".

4.7. Heating circuit with heat pump (only on BEV vehicles). 

The heat pump heat exchanger is installed in series between the coolant pump and electric heater. 
The energy consumption of the electric heating is reduced effectively by using the heat pump and can 
be saved under certain circumstances. 

In the following efficiency comparison it is clear how high the energy saving is with the heat pump. In 
order to obtain about 5 kW of heater output, about 5.5 kW of electrical power must be used for the 
electric heating (Index 2) due to resistor losses. A system with a heat pump (Index 1) only requires 


8 












101 Heating and A/C Systems 

4. First Use in BMW i 


about 2.5 kW of electrical energy in order to provide the same heater output of about 5 kW. The EKK 
consumes this electrical energy in order to compress the refrigerant and generate the heater output at 
the heat pump heat exchanger. 

By using the heat pump electrical energy of up to 3 kW can be saved in favorable conditions. This 
energy can then be used for the electric motor of the vehicle, thereby increasing the range. 

A_ 

With the heat pump, electric heating is always installed in order to ensure guaranteed heating of the 
passenger compartment in the event of a system failure.

4.8. Coolant used for the heater circuit 

For the heater circuit of the 101 the new coolant with the name "Coolant concentrate i3" is used. 

A 

Only use this coolant, otherwise it may cause the heater circuit to become damaged and clogged. 


10 

















101 Heating and A/C Systems 

4. First Use in BMW i 


This green-colored coolant can only be used for the cooling circuit of the heating in the 101. The 
heater circuit is filled with about 1.9 liters in the mixture ratio of 50/50. Freeze protection up to -40 °C / 
-40 °F is achieved. 


4.9. Heat pump 

Why does the use of a heat pump in electric vehicles make sense? 

In electric vehicles there is very little usable waste from the electrical machine and power electronics. 
Additional structural work is therefore not worthwhile in order to use this waste heat for heating 
effectively. Even if the 101 is equipped with a range extender, the waste heat from the combustion 
engine is not used. A combination of range extender with heat pump, is not offered for weight reasons. 

So that the range of the electric vehicle is not reduced significantly by the electric heating, the heating 
of the passenger compartment is offered here taking into account the heating and air-conditioning 
system with a heat pump. 

The heat pump can be viewed as a reverse principle of a heating and air-conditioning system. The 
heat energy, which is unused in cooling is lost to the surrounding area via the condenser, can be used 
for heating up the passenger compartment by redirecting the hot refrigerant to the heat pump heat 
exchanger. 

A heat pump with the components installed in the vehicle enables the function of the heating and 
cooling modes, as well as mixed operation. With about 1 kilowatt of power about 3 kilowatt of cold air 
and about 2 kilowatt of heat can be acquired using this system. The electric heating used in the 101 
requires about 5.5 kW of electrical energy in order to provide a heater output of about 5 kW. In the 
table below it is clear that the heat pump only requires about 2.5 kW for this heater output.

The operation of a heat pump in all its operating modes makes sense in a temperature range between 
-10 °C and+40 °C /14 °F and+104 °F. 

The heat pump is not an individual component, but a complex adaptation of a refrigerant 
circuit with an equally complex control structure. 

In chapter 6.4 the heat pump is described in detail.

The energy consumption at the compressor (Index 2) requires 1/4 energy to compress the refrigerant. 
The heat pump can use another 3/4 energy in the form of heat (Index 8) from the ambient heat (Index 
8). For instance, 1/4 energy consumption added to 3/4 energy-neutral ambient heat gives 4/4 of usable 
heat (Index 4), which, for example, can be transferred to a heater circuit via a coolant.

101 Heating and A/C Systems 

5. Stationary Cooling 



101 at a charging station 


Both types of heating and air-conditioning systems can also be activated by the driver when the 
vehicle is stationary. The passenger compartment can be cooled and heated. 

When the vehicle is parked for example in the blazing sun the heated interior temperature can be 
reduced within a few minutes by virtually half. The customer can activate the stationary cooling directly 
in the vehicle or by My BMW i Remote app on the iPhone® or iPad®. The passenger compartment of 
the vehicle is cooled considerably while the customer is not present. When the car is started the full 
cooling output is then available immediately without the heated warm air first coming through the air 
vents. 

The stationary cooling offers a further advantage. The high-voltage battery unit can be cooled via 
the refrigerant circuit if required. The energy for the cooling is taken from the high-voltage battery. 

Even though the energy is initially consumed for this purpose, the energy consumption is overall 
considerably lower. The battery cells are operated in an optimal range (< 30 °C / 86 °F), thus increasing 
their efficiency and service life. 


5.1. Prerequisites for stationary cooling 

The stationary cooling can only be operated when the following preconditions are satisfied: 

• The high-voltage battery is sufficiently charged 

• The vehicle is connected to a charging station 

• The charging power at the power socket must be at least 1.5 kW 

• Windows and doors should be closed to increase the efficiency. 


5.2. Displays in the vehicle 

An activated stationary cooling is displayed by a flashing fan symbol on the display with a standby 
display below it. The selected temperature and air distribution are not shown on the display, nor is the 
blower output at the blower rocker switch. If the selection "Climate control for departure" is made, this 
activation is shown in orange on the display with a fan symbol and the standby display below it. Both 
symbols are illuminated in white for the active period and show the function is running.

Preheating/Precooling 

Up to three different departure times with an additional selection of the preheating/precooling can be 
set. The departure times can be adjusted by selecting the weekdays (check marks) and the time for 
each departure time one, two and three.

The selection of the preheating/precooling for the departure has the following advantages: 

• Preheating/Precooling of the passenger compartment and optionally the high-voltage battery 
unit during the charging procedure at the departure time terminates 

• Stationary air-conditioning of the passenger compartment 

• Auxiliary heater function of the passenger compartment 

• Cooling of the high-voltage battery unit to guarantee power during charging and driving. 


5.4. Switching on and off using My BMW i Remote app 

Using the My BMW i Remote app the customer can also control the stationary cooling outside the 
vehicle. According to a similar principle in the vehicle, the stationary cooling is started or stopped or a 
switch-on time is selected.

6.1.1. Integrated automatic heating and air-conditioning system components 

An integrated automatic heating / air-conditioning regulation is offered as standard equipment. The 
IHKA, with display in the temperature selector wheel has automatic temperature, air flap and blower 
control. The automatic air recirculation control, which enables the automatic air recirculation function, 
is also installed. The button for the air recirculation function has a dual function. 

The combined audio and heating and air-conditioning controls sends signals via a Local Interconnect 
Network data bus to the IHKA control unit. If required the requests can be sent to the corresponding 
control units or components via the K-CAN4. 

The control unit is not integrated in the control panel, but bolted on at the left side at the heating and 
air-conditioning unit. 

The illuminated blue ECO PRO or also ECO PRO + display can only be displayed and also indicates 
the activated operating mode.

Automatic function 

• Automatic control of air distribution, no range of adjustment. 

• Automatic control of blower output, no range of adjustment. 

Manual operation 

• The air distribution can be changed by pressing the button for manual air distribution several 
times. The selected air distribution (top, center, bottom) is displayed by an arrow symbol on 
the display. 

• The blower intensity can be controlled manually using the rocker switch for the blower output. 


ECO PRO mode 

The ECO PRO mode supports a very efficient driving style. It influences the driving power and reduces 
the power for lighting and convenience functions or switches them off. 

This mode is selected by pressing the driving experience switch. The corresponding driving mode is 
displayed in the instrument cluster and by illuminated blue ECO PRO writing in the combined audio 
and heating and air conditioning controls. 

The interior air temperature control of the passenger compartment is controlled economically. A 
slight deviation to the set temperature and slower interior air temperature control of the passenger 
compartment is therefore possible for energy consumption.

• Deactivation of the seat heating 

• Restriction of the speed to a maximum value of 90 km/h / 55 mph. The vehicle speed limit can 
be overridden by pressing the accelerator pedal. 


Heated rear window 

The heated rear window is supplied with voltage via a relay in the Body Domain Controller. A 30 amp 
fuse in the Body Domain Controller protects the system against a short circuit and overload. As usual, 
the heated rear window has two wave traps. 

The button for switching the heated rear window is located in the combined audio and IHKA controls. 

After pressing the button the integrated green LED illuminates and displays the activated state. The 
heated rear window automatically switches off after a pre determined time and the LED goes out. 

Heating and air-conditioning unit 

In the 101 a new heating and air-conditioning unit is used. 

Properties of the heating and air-conditioning unit: 

• 1-zone IHKA 

• No left-right separation 

• No rear-seat area ventilation 

• No adjustable stratification (this happens automatically) 

• Air flow by flaps 

• No variants: Only differentiated by different expansion valves depending on equipment 

• 2-part microfilter. This can be replaced from the right passenger compartment by a Service 
flap. 

The passenger compartment temperature is controlled using an air flap in the heating and air- 
conditioning unit. A water valve is not used as the air flow can be directed continuously by the air flap 
in the heat exchanger. This is called temperature control on the air side-

The refrigerant pressure sensor switches off the EKK in the event of excess pressure in the refrigerant 
circuit in order to avoid damage to the system. The sensor is integrated in the refrigerant line. It is 
monitored by the Body Domain Controller. 

The NTC sensors in the heating and air-conditioning unit are read in and evaluated by the IHKA control 
unit. Values for the vent temperature of the footwell and the center vent, as well as the evaporator 
temperature, are recorded here. 

In the 101 a rain-light-solar-condensation sensor is installed at the windshield, similar to other BMW

Electrical machine 


The newly developed EKK from the manufacturer Visteon is built according to the principle of a 
scroll compressor. It obtains its energy from the high-voltage battery and has a maximum power 
consumption of up to 4.5 kW. The component is located in the rear and is mounted on to the electrical 
machine. 

An integrated three-phase current synchronous motor in the EKK is used as an electric motor. The 
necessary three-phase current is converted in the EKK using an AC inverter (DC/AC converter). 

The three-phase synchronous motor is operated in the engine speed range from 860 to a maximum 
of 8600 RPM’s. When stationary the speed of the EKK is restricted to 60 % of the maximum speed, 
i.e. 5160 RPM’s. The EKK can generate a maximum operating pressure of about 30 bar. The maximum 
power is required, for example, at high ambient temperatures, high interior temperatures, high 
temperatures of the high-voltage battery and low air flow of the cooling module. 

The speed of the three-phase current synchronous motor controls the EKK control unit integrated in 
the EKK depending on the requirements of the IHKA via the local interconnect network bus. The IHKA 
control unit is the main control unit. 

The supply voltage for the EKK has a voltage range (DC) of about 200 V to 410 V. The power is 
reduced above and below this voltage range or the EKK is switched off. 


30 










101 Heating and A/C Systems 

6. Components and Systems 

The EKK control unit and the DC/AC converter are integrated in the aluminium housing of the EKK 
and are cooled by refrigerant flowing around it. If the temperature of the DC/AC converter exceeds 
125 °C / 257 °F, the high-voltage supply is shut off by the EKK control unit. An attempt is made 
through different measures such as speed increase for cooling, initially the temperature is not allowed 
to rise so high. The temperature monitoring is effected by the EKK. If the temperature drops below 
112 °C / 233 °F, the EKK continues to run. 

As with all current BMW vehicles R134a refrigerant is used in the system. 

Further information on the topic of refrigerant oil can be found in chapter 4.5 of this training reference 
manual.

6. Components and Systems 

The inner disc with spiral profile is driven via a shaft by the three-phase current synchronous motor 
and rotates eccentrically. The gaseous refrigerant at low temperature and low pressure is drawn in 
through two openings in the fixed outer disc with spiral profile and compressed and heated by the 
movement to the center of the two discs with spiral profiles. 

After three eccentric revolutions, the refrigerant drawn in is compressed and heated and can escape 
in a gaseous state through an opening in the center of the outer disc. From here, gaseous refrigerant 
with high temperature and high pressure escapes via an oil separator at the connection of the EKK 
towards the refrigerant circuit. 

For more information and details please refer to the "101 High-voltage Components" training manual. 

6.2.2. Electric heating 

For heating the passenger compartment electric heating is installed, which heats up the coolant 
similar to an immersion heater. 

This high-voltage component is made up of three heater coils and an electronic control. It uses power 
of up to 5.5 kW from the high-voltage battery and sends information on the coolant temperature at the 
outlet, as well as about the current power consumption, via the Local Interconnect Network data bus 
to the IHKA control unit. The three heater coils are activated synchronously. 

The electric heating is located at the bulkhead on a bracket with the electric coolant pump.

For more information and details please refer to the "101 High-voltage Components" training manual. 


6.3. Refrigerant circuit/Cooling circuit for the heating 


6.3.1. Quantities 

Coolant quantity for the heating system 

The coolant quantity in the heating system is about 1.9 liters in all 101 versions. The additional heat 
pump heat exchanger makes this hardly noticeable. 

The system cannot be filled with the usual coolant, it flocculates. A new coolant with the 
designation "Coolant concentrate i3" is therefore used for this small circuit. This coolant cannot be 
mixed with other coolants. An appropriate warning sticker on the coolant expansion tank indicates the 
use of the new coolant. 

Refrigerant quantity 

The refrigerant circuit in the 101 with range extender is filled with 750 g (1.65 lbs). The quantity must 
be increased to 970 g (2.13 lbs) if the 101 is a BEV. 

Refrigerant oil quantity 

In the refrigerant circuit 230 g (0.5 lbs) of refrigerant oil for an 101 with the range extender and 300 g 
(0.66 lbs) for the 101 with out a range extender with the additional heat pump. 

Please observe the notes on the new refrigerant oil as described in chapter 4.5. of this training 
reference manual. 

A_ 

As refrigerant and oil quantity is crucial for the operation of the cooling system; ways refer 
to the proper repair instructions and specifications (found in ISTA) when working on any 
refrigerant system.

6.3.2. Components 

The combined expansion and shutoff valve (ETXV), which also has a shutoff function in addition to 
the thermal control, is only located at the high-voltage battery unit for the integrated heating and air- 
conditioning regulation. 

A combined expansion and shutoff valve (ETXV) is also used for the evaporator of the passenger 
compartment. 

By using the combined expansion and shutoff valve (ETXV) both cooling circuits for the cooling of the 
high-voltage battery unit and the passenger compartment can be opened and closed independent of 
each other. 

An electrically controlled expansion valve (EXV), which is only installed with the 101 with out the range 
extender equipped with a heat pump replaces all expansion valves described here at the evaporator 
for the passenger compartment and at the high-voltage battery unit. A third electrically controlled 
expansion valve (EXV), as well as four refrigerant shutoff valves, are also installed with this equipment. 

The electrically controlled expansion valves (EXV) are described in detail in chapter 6.4.2 Heat pump of 
this training manual.

The cooling circuit for heating the passenger compartment is kept in circulation using an electric 
coolant pump (12 V) with 20 W power depending on the requirements from the IHKA control unit. 

The coolant pump is located in the front on a bracket with the electric heating. The voltage supply and 
direct activation are effected via the Body Domain Controller, which receives the request via the K- 
CAN4 from the IHKA control unit. 

The electric coolant pump (12 V) runs at full speed or is switched off completely. It delivers the coolant 
from the coolant expansion tank to the electric heating. 

101 vehicles with the heat pump, the heat pump heat exchanger is installed in series between the 
coolant pump and electric heating. 


40 














101 Heating and A/C Systems 

6. Components and Systems 

The electric coolant pump (12 V) with the heat pump is switched and regulated by the additional heat 
pump controller by a pulse-width modulated signal from 0 to 50 % and continuously from 50 o 100 %. 
In the housing of the coolant pump the electronics evaluate the pulse-width modulated signal coming 
from the heat pump controller, adjust the speed of the electric coolant pump and the circulation speed 
of the coolant. 

The same coolant pump is installed in both versions. However, the center pin 2 in the connector is not 
occupied in the standard equipment. The pulse-width modulated signal is missing in this equipment 
specification as there is no heat pump controller. 

Heat exchanger 

The heat exchanger is installed in the heating and air-conditioning unit and is made from solid 
aluminium. The air flowing through is directed via the regulated air switches through the discs of the 
heat exchanger. There the air is warmed and flows on to the passenger compartment. 


6.4. Heat pump 


6.4.1. Structure and function of the heat pump 

The highly complex system of the heat pump, adapted to the heating and air-conditioning system, 
places high demands on the workshop personnel during diagnosis, but when it comes to its 
application the customer is unable to distinguish it from the conventional heating and air-conditioning 
system in 101 with the range extender. 

The heat pump is standard in the BEV vehicles = Battery Electric Vehicle.

The BEV101 with heat pump a fourth refrigerant line together with the three lines from the standard 
equipment is guided along at the right side sill to the rear end. A heat pump has about 36 other parts 
(incl. small parts such as brackets, etc.) and about 7 kg of additional weight. 

The quantity in the refrigerant circuit with heat pump is 970 g. (2.13 lbs)The quantity of the 
system with out heat pump is 750 g (1.65 lbs). These quantities are crucial to the operation of 
the system therefore it is important to always verify the quantity of refrigerant of the system 
you are working on with the specifications found in ISTA. 

The heat pump is responsible for helping increase the range with the same heating and air- 
conditioning comfort of a system without this device. From an ambient temperature of -10 °C /14 °F 
and a mean set-point value of the heating and air-conditioning system (22 °C / 71 °F in automatic 
function) an interior air temperature control without the additional heating is realized by the electric 
heating. The heat pump is no longer operated below -10 °C/14 °F. 

The operating mode of the heat pump is specified based on the requirement of the IHKA. The heat 
pump controller controls the valves and reads in the actual values. However, the central control is in the 
IHKA control unit. 

An evaluation for the diagnosis in the event of a fault is very important for such a complex system. 
Interruptions, sensor failures, mechanical faults of shutoff valves and electrically controlled expansion 
valves, can also be diagnosed. 

In the event of a fault the system activates the corresponding valve a second time. If the fault is still 
present, the EKK is switched off until the necessary workshop visit. 

The customer does not receive any notification thereof, but on hot days will notice that the air- 
conditioning system is not working. If the high-voltage battery unit becomes too hot due to a lack 
of cooling, a Check Control message is issued from the powertrain area as soon as the vehicle 
performance must be restricted in order to not allow the temperature in the high-voltage battery unit to 
further increase. The customer is requested to visit a workshop by the Check Control message.

The refrigerant is compressed by the EKK, whereby its pressure and temperature increase. The 
refrigerant evaporates as a result of the increase in temperature and is reduced into a fluid state again 
in the condenser (with integrated receiver dryer!!!) when the temperature drops slightly. In the next 
component of the refrigerant circuit, the expansion valve, the refrigerant is injected into the evaporator 
in the heating and air-conditioning unit by a defined inflow control and if required also into the cooling 
loops of the high-voltage battery unit. By injecting a small quantity into the evaporator or the cooling 
loop the high-pressure refrigerant is released quickly and can absorb heat, i.e. extract heat from the 
surrounding area. This way it is cooled. The released refrigerant is then guided back to the EKK.

If the heat pump is used in heating mode, the refrigerant shutoff valves with the numbers 17 and 
21 are closed and those with numbers 18 and 20 are open. As a result, there is a diversion of the 
refrigerant circuit through the heat pump heat exchanger. 

The heat is therefore no longer emitted unused at the condenser, but is emitted at the coolant for the 
heater circuit. An electrically controlled expansion valve (EXV) at the output of the heat pump heat 
exchanger builds up the pressure so that enough heat can develop here. In order to close the circuit 
again, the evaporator in the heating and air-conditioning unit is also used by the electrically controlled 
expansion valve (EXV) for building up the refrigerant pressure. The actual electrically controlled 
expansion valve (EXV) installed for cooling is activated so that the pressure of the refrigerant in the 
evaporator can be increased again and the arising heat can also be used. Then the released refrigerant 
is directed back through the condenser in the reverse direction via the open refrigerant shutoff valve 
18 and the receiver dryer to the EKK.

If the heat pump is used in the mixed operation, the shutoff valves with the numbers 17, 20 and 21 are 
open. The shutoff valve with the number 18 is closed as there should be no reverse flow. This results 
in a division of the hot, high-pressure refrigerant. 

On the one hand, cooling of the high-voltage battery unit and dehumidification of the passenger 
compartment can be realized by the cooling at the evaporator, on the other hand, the divided heat 
transported with the refrigerant is used for the heat pump heat exchanger. 

Another advantage in comparison to a vehicle without a heat pump is that in the event of strong 
sunlight, and hence the necessary blowing of cold air from the ventilation grille is also not necessarily 
an advantage for the footwell. The vehicle without a heat pump must be slightly heated using the 
electric heating in order to acclimatize the footwell to a pleasant temperature. In mixed operation with 
a heat pump the footwell can therefore be heated without using energy using the heat pump heat 
exchanger.

Heat pump controller 



Installation location of heat pump controller, BEV only 

The local interconnect network bus serves as a data line for the communication between the heat 
pump controller and the IHKA control unit. 

The control of the actuators such as the refrigerant shutoff valves and the electrically controlled 
expansion valves (EXV), as well as the evaluation of the sensor system (refrigerant temperature 
sensors and refrigerant pressure-temperature sensors), is processed by the heat pump controller on 
the analog route. 

The heat pump controller is responsible for the conversion of analog signals to digital signals and vice 
versa. 

The coolant pump, as the only component of the heating and air-conditioning system, is supplied with 
voltage from the Body Domain Controller. However, the control is effected via the heat pump controller 
in the form of a pulse-width modulated signal. 

The central control is assumed by the IHKA control unit connected via the local interconnect network 
bus. The heat pump controller only implements its commands and makes available the sensor values.

Refrigerant temperature sensors 

There are three temperature sensors in the refrigerant circuit, which transmit their values to the heat 
pump controller for evaluation. 

Refrigerant pressure-temperature sensors 

In addition to the three refrigerant temperature sensors, two refrigerant pressure-temperature sensors 
are also installed in the refrigerant circuit of the heat pump. They transmit their values to the heat 
pump controller for evaluation. 

A 

If a sensor has to be replaced due to a fault, after drawing off the refrigerant ensure that the screw 
thread is held using a suitable tool when removing. This way damage to the refrigerant line is avoided. 
The replacement of a faulty refrigerant line involves timely and costly repair work.

Refrigerant shutoff valve 

There are a total of four refrigerant shutoff valves. The individual shutoff valves control the refrigerant 
circuit and can cause a different direction of flow for the refrigerant condenser and the evaporator 
with their switching. The different operating modes of the heat pump such as cooling, heating mode 
and mixed operation can therefore be implemented. It is not possible to reverse the direction of the 
refrigerant circuit of the EKK and the receiver dryer due to the lubrication and compression via the air 
conditioning compressor. The refrigerant always flows through these two components in the same 
direction of flow. 

The refrigerant shutoff valves are open or closed by the heat pump controller, according to the 
messages sent by the IHKA. The shutoff valves are only controlled as fully open or closed, whereby 
three of the four shutoff valves are spring loaded open without current and one is spring loaded closed 
without current. The closed refrigerant shutoff valve is open during heating mode of the heat pump 
and allows the return flow of the refrigerant from the condenser via the receiver dryer to the EKK. 

The refrigerant shutoff valves are all located in the front area of the vehicle and are available in the two 
versions mentioned below.

Electrically controlled expansion valve (EXV) 

With the heat pump, the thermally controlled expansion valve (TXV), as well as the combined 
expansion and shutoff valve (ETXV) for the cooling loop in the high-voltage battery unit, are replaced 
for three electrically controlled expansion valves (EXV). These valves have no thermal control, they 
control the refrigerant circuit infinitely from 0 to 100 % with their stepper motor. 


57 






101 Heating and A/C Systems 

6. Components and Systems 

The electrically controlled expansion valves (EXV) are subject to calibration after every 20th 
engagement of the parking lock in order to adjust the accuracy of the activation and guarantee exact 
control of the valves. The activation is generally effected roughly three minutes after the vehicle has 
stopped.

receiver dryer 

The receiver dryer with the heat pump, satisfies the function of the intake plenum and moves the 
refrigerant circuit through the refrigerant oil with the necessary lubrication. It serves as a storage 
volume in order to be able to offset the refrigerant which decreases slowly over time and to guarantee 
operation of the heat pump circuit. 

In a vehicle with a heat pump the receiver dryer is bigger as the volume of the refrigerant circuit here 
is larger, requiring an increased offset range. The receiver dryer is located in the front right area below 
the front light assembly. In a 101 REX vehicle that has a condenser with integrated receiver dryer 
cannot be replaced individually. It must be replaced together with the condenser.

7. Service Information 


There is no maintenance for the refrigerant circuit. 

The corresponding warnings must be adapted to the use of the refrigerant. 

A_ 

Work on heating and air-conditioning systems must only be performed by competent and 
qualified personnel. 


7.1. Maintenance of refrigerant circuit/heating system 

The coolant in the heater circuit must be replaced according to the specified service intervals. 

Attention must be paid that the correct coolant with the designation "Coolant concentrate i3" is used, 
as has already been described in this technical training manual. 


7.2. Replacing the microfilter 

Special attention must be paid to the replacement of the two microfilters. If the upper filter was 
removed for the replacement, then the lower filter must also be replaced. 

The lower microfilter is barely visible and must be pulled upwards in order to be replaced.

7.3. Diagnosis and maintenance with ISTA 

In the Integrated Service Technical Application ISTA the diagnosis and activation of the sensors, 
actuators and components can be performed using procedures.

7. Service Information 


A _ 

Upon connection to an A/C service station all refrigerant shutoff valves and expansion valves 
have to be opened with an electric control in order to be able to evacuate or fill the entire 
refrigerant circuit. This is done by following the procedure in ISTA. 


Further service functions are integrated in the procedures and are not yet identified at the time of the 
creation of this technical training manual. 

7.4. A/C service station 



A/C service station (European model shown) 


The refrigerant filling of R134a is identified with black screw caps on the filling valves. The current A/C 
service stations are still used for the 101. 


A 

Since the 101 BEV version is equipped with a heat pump, the diagnostic program must be 
started via ISTA before commencement of the evacuation with the A/C service station in 
order to open the electrically controlled expansion valves and the refrigerant shutoff valves

of the refrigerant circuit. This procedure must also be observed for a vehicle in the standard 
equipment. However, only the combined expansion and shutoff valves have to be opened 
here. 


If access is not possible via the diagnostic program, then as an emergency solution the refrigerant 
temperature sensor 3 (see Index 4) in the refrigerant circuit is removed when terminal 15 is switched 
on in order to cause the opening of all refrigerant shutoff valves and electrically controlled expansion 
valves EXV. Terminal 15 must also remain switched on after the sensor plug is removed in order to 
maintain the function. This procedure is only possible for vehicles equipped with the heat pump.
