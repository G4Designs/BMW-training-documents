101 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 


The comprehensive package of current assist systems was adapted to the 101 and enhanced with 
new innovative systems to make driving a more pleasant and safer experience. The functions in the 
101 are optionally available in combinations as camera-based systems by using a shared camera and 
corresponding control unit. 

The assist systems facilitate driving of the vehicle by 

♦ providing the driver with information 

♦ giving the driver suggestions 

♦ automatically intervening in the driving process. 

This training reference manual contains an overview of all driver assist systems used in the 101: 

♦ Camera-based collision warning 

♦ Collision warning with city braking function 

♦ Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

♦ Speed Limit Information 

♦ Proactive driving assistant 

♦ Rearview camera 

♦ Park Distance Control 

♦ Parking maneuvering assistant 

♦ Cruise control. 



With the BMW 101, the majority of assist systems are only available in package combinations. 


For more information on the operating concept of the assist systems, please refer to the operating 
instructions.

2. KAFAS 


The recognition of vehicles driving ahead, and the detection of objects and lane boundary markings 
are among the most important prerequisites to be met by assist systems. This applies not only for the 
far range but also the close range. The functions in the 101 are optionally available in combinations as 
camera-based systems using a shared camera and shared control unit. 

The KAFAS camera and KAFAS control unit are main components of the following assist systems: 

• Camera-based collision warning 

• Collision warning with city braking function 

• Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

• Speed Limit Information 

• Camera-based cruise control with Stop & Go function 

• Traffic jam assistant. 


2.1. Detection range 



Detection range of KAFAS camera

Detection range of KAFAS camera 


The KAFAS camera has a detection range of up to about 40 m ahead of the vehicle and up to about 
5 m in front of the vehicle on the right and left. 


2.2. Person recognition 

The KAFAS camera records the scenery ahead of the vehicle and uses image processing to detect 
the complete rear views of moving and stationary vehicles in the field of view. The KAFAS camera 
also ensures that driving lane information, vehicle position and movements are determined at the 
same time. With the aid of the image data from the KAFAS camera, objects can be clearly identified as 
vehicles and corresponding transverse movements as lane changes. The KAFAS camera also detects 
people and cyclists.

The KAFAS camera records the roadway up to about 40 m ahead of the vehicle and up to about 5 m 
to the right and left of the vehicle. The image data is forwarded to the KAFAS control unit where it 
is evaluated. By means of image processing, the control unit searches the images recorded by the 
KAFAS camera for lane and road markings.

The appearance of the road markings and signs can vary considerably in the image depending on 
the country, type of road or the current ambient conditions. The system can detect a wide range of 
road markings and types of markings. For a lane marking to be evaluated, the KAFAS camera and the 
KAFAS control unit must first be able to clearly identify it. For a lane to be evaluated, its average width 
must be greater than 2.5 m. 

The KAFAS camera and KAFAS control unit are the most important elements of the assist systems in 
the 101 as these are extensively camera based.

2.5. Functional limitations 

The function of the KAFAS camera and thus also the function of the corresponding assist systems 
may be impaired, due to the physical limits of the optical systems for example, in the following 
situations: 

♦ heavy fog, rain or snow 

♦ bright light in the camera lens 

♦ if the viewing area of the KAFAS camera or the windshield is dirty 

♦ on tight corners 

♦ up to 10 seconds after driving readiness is activated via the START-STOP button 

♦ during the calibration process of the KAFAS camera immediately after vehicle delivery or a 
camera replacement. 



Example of limits of the KAFAS camera 



System and functional limitations mean that warnings and bans may under certain circumstances not 
be issued or are issued too late or without authorization. The driver must therefore always remain alert 
and observant so that they can actively intervene at any time so as to avoid the risk of an accident.

3. Optional Equipment System 

The control unit for the optional equipment system (SAS) which features a large number of driver 
assistance functions is being used for the first time in the 101. 

Possible functions: 

♦ Camera-based collision warning 

♦ Collision warning with city braking function 

♦ Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

♦ Proactive driving assistant 

♦ Parking maneuvering assistant 

♦ Cruise control with braking function 

♦ Camera-based cruise control with Stop & Go function 

The optional equipment system (SAS) is not part of the standard vehicle equipment and is installed 
depending on which optional equipment is used. 



Control unit for optional equipment system (SAS) 


The image data required by the optional system (SAS) is made available by the KAFAS control unit. 
The SAS is connected to the FlexRay, and also to the KAFAS control unit via a Local-CAN.

4. Camera-based Collision Warning 

The camera-based collision warning is an element of the optional equipment ACC Stop & Go + Active 
Driving Assistant (SA5AT). The collision warning warns the driver of a possible collision danger and 
is effected via the KAFAS camera and KAFAS control unit. The camera-based collision warning was 
extended in the BMW 101 to incorporate the functions collision warning with city braking function and 
pedestrian warning with city braking function. 

The system warns the driver in situations where a collision is imminent. The early warning, a visual 
signal, is issued first to draw the driver's attention to the situation. If the situation becomes more 
critical, an acute early warning in the form of a visual and acoustic signal is issued. The nature of the 
warning is such that the driver can still prevent a collision providing he/she acts quickly. 


4.1. Operation 

The collision warning and pedestrian warning functions are switched on automatically when the 
driving readiness is activated via the START-STOP button. 

Switching on/off 

The collision warning and pedestrian warning are switched on and off via the Intelligent Safety button.

Adjusting the warning time 

When the collision warning is activated the driver can set the time of the early warning in three stages. 
The "late" setting corresponds to the point of the acute warning. 

The setting is made via the iDrive: 


8 






101 Driver Assistance Systems

♦ "Settings" 

♦ "Collision warning" 

♦ Set the required warning time via the controller at the Central Information Display. 

The setting for the time of the early warning is saved for the current driver profile or for the ID 
transmitter currently used. 


4.2. Functional principle 

The KAFAS camera records the scenery ahead of the vehicle and uses image processing to detect the 
complete rear views of moving and stationary vehicles in the field of view. 



Collision warning detection range by KAFAS video camera 


The corresponding warning stages "early warning" and "acute warning" are output in critical situations 
on the basis of the calculated positions, distances and relative speeds of other vehicles. For the early 
warning the brakes of the vehicle are prepared for emergency braking and the activation thresholds 
of the brake assistants are reduced. If the driver makes the conscious decision to drive up close to 
the vehicle ahead, warnings which may otherwise be distracting can be prevented by reducing the 
sensitivity of the system. 


Collision warning with city braking function 


The collision warning with city braking function extends the camera-based collision warning with a 
braking function from a speed of roughly 10 km/h / 6 mph up to a maximum speed of 60 km/h / 37 
mph. If an acute warning is issued within this speed range, the vehicle is decelerated by 4 m/s 2 at the 
most. 


The brake intervention is restricted to roughly 1.6 seconds. This avoids additional dangers for the 
following traffic.

Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

The system provides a warning against a collision with pedestrians from a speed of roughly 10 km/h / 6 
mph up to a maximum speed of 60 km/h / 37 mph . 

The KAFAS camera records the scenery ahead of the vehicle and uses image processing to detect 
pedestrians in the field of view. An acute warning is output in critical situations on the basis of the 
calculated positions, distances and the movement of the identified pedestrians. An early warning is 
not available for the pedestrian warning with city braking function. With an acute warning the vehicle is 
decelerated by roughly 4 m/s 2 . 



Example of person recognition by KAFAS camera 

The warning zone for person recognition in front of the vehicle is subdivided into two areas. The 
central area (ahead of the vehicle) and the additional area (to the left and right in front of the vehicle).

4.3. Warning function 

The warning function is divided into two stages. If there is a danger of collision, a warning symbol is 
displayed at the instrument cluster. 

Display 




Early warning: 

♦ Vehicle symbol lights up red 

♦ Text message: Increase distance and, if 
necessary, brake. 

Acute warning: 

♦ Vehicle symbol flashes red and a signal 
sounds 

♦ Text message: Request for intervention 
by braking and, if required, evasive 
action. 


11 




















101 Driver Assistance Systems 

4. Camera-based Collision Warning 


Acute warning: 

♦ Person symbol flashes red and a signal 
sounds 

♦ Text message: Request for intervention 
by braking and, if required, evasive 
action. 

Early warning 

The early warning is issued, for example, if there is a danger of collision because the vehicle driving 
ahead is being driven at a much slower speed and/or if the distance to a driven or stationary vehicle 
ahead is extremely short. 

The early warning is indicated by a vehicle symbol which lights up red in the instrument cluster. 

The time of the early warning can be configured in the CID. 



The collision warning is dependent on the vehicle's inherent driving speed. The distance calculated for 
the collision warning is much lower than the minimum distance required by law. It is therefore still the 
driver's responsibility to maintain the legal minimum distance. 



Acute warning 

The acute warning is issued by the system as late as possible and only if there is an imminent danger 
of a collision when the vehicle is approaching the vehicle driving ahead at a relatively high differential 
speed or if there is an imminent danger of a collision with a pedestrian. The point at which the acute 
warning is issued is calculated in such a way that a collision can only be avoided by immediate 
emergency braking or by an evasive manoeuvre. The acute warning therefore cannot be deliberately 
brought about or monitored by the driver. 

If the vehicle is for example approaching the vehicle driving ahead at very low speed, or is approaching 
a person, an acute warning is not issued even when the distance is very small. This deliberately 
brought-about driving situation merely triggers off the early warning. In this way, less sensible and thus 
more annoying acute warnings are avoided by the system. 

The acute warning cannot be deactivated. The timing of the acute warning also cannot be adjusted. 

If the acute warning is not to be issued, the "collision warning" front protective function must be 
deactivated. 


The acute warning issues a prompt for intervention and is supported if there is a danger of collision 
by a two-stage intervention. Once the driver has been warned of the danger of collision, brake 
preconditioning initially takes place followed by the initiation of automatic brake intervention to avert 
the collision danger. 


The brake intervention is restricted to roughly 1.6 seconds. This avoids additional dangers for the 
following traffic. 

Once the target object has been verified by the camera data braking intervention takes place at 
roughly 4 m/s 2 . This achieves a speed reduction of up to approx. 16 km/h. In the bottom speed range 
braking up to a standstill is therefore entirely possible. 


12 






101 Driver Assistance Systems 

4. Camera-based Collision Warning 

In the speed range of 10 km/h / 6 mph to 60 km/h / 37 mph , brake intervention is applied at a brake 
force of roughly 4 m/s 2 when collision with a pedestrian is detected. 

Brake intervention also takes place if the driver fails to press the brake pedal sufficiently. 

Brake intervention is applied only when Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is switched on. 

In the event of an acute warning, a red flashing vehicle symbol or a red flashing person symbol is 
displayed for the driver at the instrument cluster. In addition, an acoustic warning signal is sounded. 



The acute warning does not relieve the driver of their responsibility to adapt their driving speed and 
driving style to the road and traffic conditions and to maintain the prescribed safety distance. 


Brake intervention can be cancelled by pressing the accelerator pedal or by applying a clear steering 
wheel movement. 

The braking function is deactivated when Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) or Dynamic Traction Control 
(DTC) is deactivated. 

Chronological sequence 

The timescale of the warnings and the braking is shown in the following graphic. There is no brake 
intervention if an avoidance by the driver is recognized.

Range of detection 



The collision warning has a limited capacity for detection. This means that warnings sometime may 
not be issued or may be issued late. 

The following vehicles may possibly not be detected: 


♦ A vehicle traveling at slow speed when approaching at high speed 

♦ Vehicles that cut in suddenly or are heavily decelerating 

♦ Vehicles with an unusual rear view or with poorly visible rear lights 

♦ Partially concealed vehicles 

♦ Two-wheeled vehicles traveling ahead. 

Functional limitations 

The function of the KAFAS camera and thus also the function of the corresponding assist systems 
may be impaired in the following situations, for example: 

♦ heavy fog, rain or snow 

♦ insufficient daylight 

♦ bright light in the camera lens 

♦ if the viewing area of the KAFAS video camera or the windshield is dirty 

♦ on sharp curves 

♦ with persons up to approx. 80 cm in height. 

♦ up to 10 seconds after an engine start via the START-STOP button 

♦ during the calibration process of the KAFAS video camera immediately after vehicle delivery or 
a camera replacement.

5. Road Sign Recognition 

The road sign recognition displays a road sign symbol in the instrument cluster which shows the 
maximum speed limit currently detected. The KAFAS camera detects road signs at the edge of the 
road. The optional equipment road sign recognition is an element of the optional equipment ACC Stop 
& Go + Active Driving Assistant (SA 5AT). 



Responsibility for the vehicle and for the speed that is adopted rests exclusively with the driver. 


5.1. Operation 

The road sign recognition can be switched on and off in the iDrive menu by making the following 
selection via the controller: 

♦ Settings 

♦ KOMBI 

♦ Speed Limit Info 

If the road sign recognition is switched on, this is displayed at the KOMBI in the instrument cluster. If 
a speed limit symbol with three horizontal dashes is displayed in the instrument cluster instead of the 
max. permissible speed, the road sign recognition is not available. 


5.2. System limits 

The system has a detection rate of around 90 to 95%. 

Traffic signs for top speed limitations that do not comply with the legal standard, particularly those 
without square frames, are not always detected. The same applies to road signs which are fully or 
partially concealed by stickers, dirt or vegetation. Long distances to the road sign, high driving speeds 
and poor weather conditions, particularly at night, make it more difficult for the system to recognize 
road signs reliably. To ensure the current top speed limitations are displayed as accurately as possible, 
the data of the navigation road map should be up-to-date. 

The functionality of the road sign display may be limited, e.g. in the following situations, which can lead 
to an incorrect display: 

♦ heavy fog, rain or snow 

♦ if signs are covered by objects 

♦ if driving at close proximity to a vehicle driving ahead 

♦ strong light in the camera lens 

♦ if the windshield in front of the interior mirror is fogged, dirty or covered by labels, etc. 

♦ as a result of incorrect detection by the camera 

♦ if the top speed limitations stored in the navigation system are incorrect 

♦ in areas not covered by the navigation system 


18 





101 Driver Assistance Systems 

5. Road Sign Recognition 


in the event of deviations from the navigation, e.g. due to modified road layouts 

if traffic signs do not correspond to the standard 

when calibrating the camera immediately after vehicle delivery. 


Supplementary sign recognition 

The system can only recognize supplementary signs with pictograms (icons), such as e.g. "In wet 
conditions", "In rain/snow conditions", "Trucks" or "Trailers". Text references to supplementary signs 
basically cannot be read or interpreted. 

Before top speed limitations with a limited applicability are displayed, the system checks the vehicle 
electrical system for more information. Thus, with the validity "In wet conditions" the status of the 
windscreen wiper is evaluated or with the validity "In frost/snow conditions" the temperature value 
from the outside temperature sensor is evaluated. 

The time limits of the top speed limitation can then only be evaluated correctly if the period of validity 
is stored in the navigation map and the clock in the vehicle is set correctly. Otherwise the top speed 
limitation or ban on passing/overtaking is displayed as currently valid. 

The trailer signal for vehicles in towing mode is not evaluated for the display of top speed limitations, 
as they differ from country to country and depend on the trailer type. 

Other supplementary road signs are not recognized. The top speed limitation is then displayed as valid 
and up-to-date without the interpretation of the supplementary road sign. 

Road signs on parallel, branching-off or merging roads and on exits 

Parallel roads are recognized neither with the KAFAS camera nor with the aid of the navigation map. 
Signs erected there could be incorrectly recognized and displayed as top speed limitation for the road 
currently being driven on. 

Top speed limitations for branching-off or merging roads are usually also adopted and displayed for 
the road currently being driven on. 

Top speed limitations on motorway exits with or without an additional arrow sign are usually correctly 
evaluated and suppressed in the display when the exit is passed providing the navigation map data is 
up-to-date. 


In the case of overhead motorway signs with different, lane-specific top speed limitations, the top 
speed limitation nearest to the lane in which the vehicle is driving in is displayed. The display is not 
modified after a later lane change. 


Information signs in the road sign surroundings 


Information signs with top speed limitations, e.g. at border crossings with references to the different 
legal maximum speeds for ordinary roads and highways, can be mistakenly recognized as currently 
valid and displayed. The same applies to information signs with different color configurations, e.g. for 
minimum or recommended speeds. 

Stickers on vehicles 


Stickers on vehicles driving ahead or overtaken vehicles indicating a top speed limitation, e.g. trucks, 
buses, trailers and construction machinery, could be mistakenly recognized and displayed as the 
currently valid top speed limitation. 


19 



101 Driver Assistance Systems 

5. Road Sign Recognition 

Town/city limits 

If the town/city limits sign is not clearly recognized and the data in the navigation map is not up-to- 
date, the top speed limitation at town/city limits may be incorrectly displayed. 

Legal changes 

If maximum speeds prescribed by law are changed, these are only available after a software update. 
The original speed limits which no longer apply continue to be displayed until the software is updated. 



The system cannot replace the driver's personal assessment of the road and traffic situation. System 
and functional limitations mean that warnings and bans may under certain circumstances not be 
issued or are issued too late or without authorisation. Road sign recognition supports the driver and 
does not replace the human eye. 


20 




101 Driver Assistance Systems 

6. Proactive Driving Assistant 

This proactive driving assistant detects bends, entrances to towns, roundabouts, intersections, 
junctions, speed limits and highway exits using the data from the navigation system and can suggest 
at an early stage that the driver should take his foot off the accelerator pedal. A message is also issued 
if the section of road ahead has not yet been detected. This information is displayed in the instrument 
cluster until the road section is reached. The proactive driving assistant helps drivers who are not 
familiar with the route or area to drive more efficiently.

The proactive driving assistant can be used when the route guidance is active and inactive. When the 
route guidance is not active, the most likely route is used for evaluation. However, the calculation can 
be performed more accurately, and therefore more efficiently, when the route guidance is active.

The rear view camera is only available in conjunction with the parking assistance package (SA 5DU) 
included in the Parking Package ZPK and provides the driver with additional support when entering/ 
exiting parking spaces and when maneuvering. 



The image from the reversing camera is displayed with additional extension lines in the Central 
Information Display. The display help lines function can be switched on and off by the driver via the 
controller.

The new camera must be taught in after the reversing camera is replaced. The reversing camera of the 
101 does not need to be calibrated after teaching-in, as it is self-calibrating. The calibration is carried 
out during driving by the TRSVC control unit by means of a steering angle sensor and known road 
markings. Installation tolerances are done by shifting and rotating the image during calibration. The 
maximum time required for a full calibration is five hours. A Check Control message is displayed in the

8. Park Distance Control 


Park Distance Control (PDC) assists the driver when maneuvering in and out of a parking space. 

The front and rear Park Distance Control (SA 508) is included in the optional Parking Package (ZPK) in 
the 101.. 

The distance between the vehicle and obstacle is measured by four ultrasonic sensors in the rear 
bumper and, in vehicles with Park Distance Control, four additional ultrasonic sensors are also 
incorporated into the front bumper. 


8.1. System components 

The PMA control unit is used instead of the PDC control unit in vehicles with the optional equipment 
Parking Maneuvering Assistant. The PMA control unit is exactly the same dimensions and installation 
position as the PDC control unit. Compared to the PDC control unit, the PMA control unit has a more 
powerful processor and software.

The Park Distance Control system is enabled in the following situations: 

♦ if drive position R is engaged when driving readiness is switched on 

♦ if the parking assistance button in the switch block next to the iDrive is pressed when driving 
readiness is switched on 

♦ the activation takes place automatically if the vehicle is equipped with the optional equipment 
Parking Package (SA ZPK) and obstacles behind or in front of the vehicle are detected by the 
Park Distance Control and the vehicle is traveling at less than approx. 3 km/h /1 mph.

With Park Distance Control system (SA 508) which is included in the optional Parking Package ZPK, 
activation only takes place when the drive position "R" is engaged. A parking assistance button is not 
installed with this configuration. 

The automatic activation of the PDC system is implemented in combination with the optional 
equipment Parking Package (SA ZPK). The automatic activation which takes place when obstacles are 
detected can be switched on and off via the controller in the "Settings" menu. The settings are stored 
for the ID transmitter which is currently being used.

Automatic activation of the PDC system by the Auto PDC is only possible within a speed range of less 
than 3 km/h. 



If Auto PDC was active and was switched off via the PDC button, the speed threshold of 5 km/h / 3 
mph must have been exceeded once for the Auto PDC to be operational once again. 


The driver is notified about the results of the distance measurements and the distance warnings 
acoustically via the audio speakers and optically via the Central Information Display CID. As the vehicle 
approaches an object, the corresponding position is indicated by an intermittent tone via the audio 
speaker. If, for example, an object is detected behind the vehicle to the left, the rear left speaker emits 
an acoustic signal. A continuous alarm sounds when the object is at a distance of about 25 cm or less. 
The volume of the acoustic signal of the Park Distance Control system can be adjusted in relation to 
the audio playback of the entertainment system.

8. Park Distance Control 


Similar to other BMW models, the deactivation is distance/speed based. It is switched off after driving 
of about 50 m or at speeds in excess of 36 km/h / 22 mph. 

If a fault develops, a Check Control message ("PDC has malfunctioned. Have system checked.") is 
displayed in the Central Information Display CID. In addition, the detection range of the sensors is 
shown shaded in the Central Information Display CID. 


8.4. System limits 

Due to the physical limits during the ultrasonic measurement, obstructions may not be detected by the 
Park Distance Control system. Several examples of this are shown below: 

♦ when the objects are thin or wedge-shaped 

♦ when the objects are low 

♦ when objects that, due to their shape, have corners and sharp edges 

♦ with snow 

♦ if the objects have a porous surface. 

A warning may also be displayed although there is no obstruction in the detection range; in the 
following situations for example: 

♦ when it is raining heavily 

♦ if the sensors are heavily soiled or iced over 

♦ if the sensors are covered with snow 

♦ if the street surface is rough 

♦ if the road surface is bumpy, e.g. speed bumps 

♦ due to heavy exhaust gas fumes 

♦ due to other ultrasound sources. 

To ensure the ultrasonic sensors remain fully operational, they must be kept clean and free of ice. 
When cleaning the sensors using a high pressure cleaner, avoid direct and sustained contact with a 
high-pressure water jet. Furthermore, when using high pressure cleaners, a distance of at least 30 cm 
from the sensors must be maintained. 



The Park Distance Control cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the traffic situation. Also 
check the traffic situation by taking a look around the vehicle. Otherwise there is a risk of accidents 
occurring, due to other road users or objects that are outside the detection range of the Park Distance 
Control for example. Loud sound sources outside and inside the vehicle could drown out the PDC 
signal.

9. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) supports the driver in many ways. The assistant measures 
the size of a gap between cars and decides based on the result whether the gap is large enough on the 
one hand and relieves the driver of the task of maneuvering into the space on the other. The Parking 
Maneuvering Assistant (SA 5DP) is used in the 101 as optional equipment and can only be ordered in 
conjunction with the Parking Package (SA ZPK). 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) has one additional function with the BMW 101. In the 
101 the Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) can now in addition to steering also perform the 
acceleration, braking and gear changing when parking parallel to and at the side of the road.

9.3. Sensors 



Installation location, ultrasonic sensors of Parking Maneuvering Assistant 


The gaps between cars are measured via two additional ultrasonic sensors which are integrated into 
the front wheel arch. These two sensors are connected to the control unit of the Parking Maneuvering 
Assistant (PMA) which also incorporates the PDC function. The function of the two ultrasonic sensors 
is similar to that of the PDC. Ultrasonic pulses are transmitted and echo signals are received. 


38 

















101 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

9.4. Control unit 



Installation location, control unit of Parking Maneuvering Assistant 


The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) control unit evaluates the signals from the ultrasonic 
sensors and calculates the length and width of a gap between cars using the distance information 
from the Dynamic Stability Control. Furthermore, it evaluates the signals from the sensors and thus 
identifies possible parking spaces. It also calculates the optimum path into a parking space, monitors 
the parking process and controls the electromechanical steering. 

The main unit of the function is integrated into the SAS, from where the longitudinal control, the 
displays in the headunit, the brake and electric motor are activated, and the lateral guidance in the 
PMA is enabled.

9. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

9.5. Functional principle 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant facilitates parking in gaps between cars parallel to the roadway. 
When driving forwards straight ahead up to speeds of roughly 35 km/h / 22 mph, parking spaces are 
measured irrespective of whether the Parking Maneuvering Assistant is activated or deactivated. 

If a gap that is the same length as the vehicle plus approx. 1.2 m has been found and if the system 
is already activated, this gap is displayed to the driver. The ultrasonic sensors of the PMA measure 
parking spaces on both sides of the vehicle and parking spaces that have been detected are displayed 
to the driver in the CID. 



Measurement of the gap 


The PMA calculates the optimum parking line and subsequently undertakes the complete vehicle 
guidance with steering, braking and changing drive position. Gear P is engaged at the end of the 
parking operation. 

The driver is still responsible for monitoring the vehicle environment and can intervene in the 
automatic parking manoeuvre at any time if required due to the vehicle environment. When 
searching fora parking space and when parking, all relevant information is presented to the driver 
in an integrated display; from the parking space itself to the status of the parking assistant and 
corresponding handling instructions through to distances from other objects. 

Personal responsibility: 

♦ Directly monitor the parking space and parking procedure and intervene if necessary, as 
otherwise an accident may occur 

♦ If a parking space that has already been measured changes, the system does not take this into 
account 

♦ The system does not take loads that project beyond the vehicle into account during parking 

♦ The PMA may steer the vehicle over or up onto curbs. You should therefore use the facility for 
active intervention at any time with caution as you may otherwise damage wheels and tires or 
the vehicle itself. 



The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility 
during parking. The driver must therefore always remain alert and observant so that they can actively 
intervene at any time so as to avoid the risk of an accident.

9. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

9.6. Functional prerequisites 

Measuring parking spaces 

♦ Driving forwards straight-ahead up to approx. 35 km/h / 22 mph 

♦ Maximum distance to the row of parked vehicles: 1.5 m 

Suitable parking spaces 

♦ Minimum length of space: own vehicle length plus approx. 1.2 m 

♦ Minimum depth: approx. 1.5 m. 

Parking procedure 

♦ Closed doors 

♦ Automatic Hold brake released 

♦ The corresponding turn indicator must be on when parking . 

9.7. Operation 

In principle there are two ways to activate the Parking Maneuvering Assistant: 

Activation via parking assistance button 

When the PMA is activated via the parking assistance button in the center console the parking 
assistance menu in the CID is displayed. As soon as a parking space is found, the driver receives 
handling instructions that guide him though the parking procedure with the support of the system. 
When parking automatically, the driver must press the parking assistance button until the parking 
procedure is complete.

Parking assistance button 


Activation by "Engaging reverse gear" followed by "iDrive controller operation" 

When the reverse gear is engaged, the parking assistance menu is displayed in the CID accompanied 
by the status of the parking space search. The PMA is however not yet activated. This is indicated by 
the PMA symbol in the symbol bar of the CID. In order to park supported by the system, the parking 
operation must be activated via the controller by selecting the corresponding symbol in the symbol bar 
at the CID. When parking automatically, the driver must press the parking assistance button until the 
parking procedure is complete. 

Park procedure 

A checkmark then appears on the right below the PMA symbol in the CID to tell the driver that the 
PMA is active. 



Parking procedure via PMA 


If the PMA is activated during the journey via the PDC button, the driver is informed about the parking 
space search in the CID. If a parking space is found, this appears on the corresponding side in the CID. 
The driver is also at the same time instructed to stop the vehicle. 



Parking procedure via PMA 


The driver is instructed to confirm the parking space by pressing the turn indicator in the 
corresponding direction. 


42 








101 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 



Parking procedure via PMA 


The parking procedure can now be started by pressing the PDC button. The PDC button must be held 
pressed. The driver must then release the brake. 




To park vehicle: lake hands off 
steering wheel, then press 
and hold PDC button. 






Parking procedure via PMA 


Upon completion, an acoustic signal sounds and a confirmation message appears to tell the driver that 
the parking procedure is complete. The PMA engages P thus preventing the vehicle from rolling away.

Manual deactivation criteria 


The Parking Maneuvering Assistant can be deactivated at any time if necessary by the driver via 
the controller by selecting the corresponding symbol in the symbol bar on the CID. Another way to 
deactivate the PMA is to release the parking assistance button in the switch block next to the Drive 
controller. 

If a fault develops, a Check Control message ("The PDC has malfunctioned. Have system checked.") is 
displayed in the CID. 


43 



101 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

Automatic deactivation criteria 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant is switched off automatically when the following events occur: 

♦ the parking assistance button is released 

♦ the driver holds on to the steering wheel or steers himself 

♦ a gear is selected that does not correspond to the instruction on the Control Display 

♦ when accelerating 

♦ the automatic parking brake is secured 

♦ the turn indicator opposite the required parking side is switched on 

♦ at speeds above approx. 10 km/h / 6 mph 

♦ possibly if the roadway is covered with snow or is slippery 

♦ the tailgate is open 

♦ possibly if the objects are difficult to overcome, e.g. parking curbs 

♦ if obstructions suddenly appear 

♦ a maximum number of parking maneuvers or parking duration has been exceeded. 


9.8. System limits 

The detection of objects can test the ultrasonic measurement system to its limits. Several examples of 
this are shown below: 

♦ with trailer towbars and couplings 

♦ if the objects are thin or wedge-shaped 

♦ if the objects are projecting and elevated, e.g. wall projections or vehicle loads 

♦ if the objects have corners and sharp edges 

♦ if the objects have fine surfaces or structures, e.g. fences. 

Low objects that are already displayed, e.g. curbs, may fall within the blind spot of the sensors before 
or after the point where a continuous alarm sounds. It would not be possible to detect objects that are 
higher up and project, e.g. wall projections. Parking spaces may be detected although these are not 
suitable. 

Functional limitations are possible in the following situations, for example: 

♦ if the sensors are dirty or iced up 

♦ heavy fog, rain or snow 

♦ on an uneven surface, e.g. gravel roads 

♦ on a slippery surface 

♦ on steep inclines or downhill gradients 

♦ if leaves have gathered or snow has piled up in the parking space. 


44 






101 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

To ensure the ultrasonic sensors remain fully operational, they must be kept clean and free of ice. 
When cleaning the sensors using a high pressure cleaner, avoid direct and sustained contact with a 
high-pressure water jet. Furthermore, when using high pressure cleaners, a distance of at least 30 cm 
from the sensors must be maintained. 



The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the 
traffic situation. Also check the traffic situation by taking a look around the vehicle. Otherwise there is 
a risk of accidents occurring, due to other road users or objects that are outside the detection range of 
the Park Distance Control PDC for example. Loud sound sources outside and inside the vehicle may 
mask the acoustic signals of the PMA or the PDC. 


45 




101 Driver Assistance Systems 

10. Cruise Control 


10.1. Introduction 

Two cruise control systems are available with the 101. The customer can choose between the standard 
equipment DCC cruise control with braking function and the optional equipment ACC Stop & Go + 
Active Driving Assistant which is included in the Technology + Driving Assistant Package (SA ZTD). 

A 


The speed control systems support the driver with adapting his speed, distance and driving style 
to the traffic conditions but do not relieve him of this responsibility. The driver may need to actively 
intervene, e.g. by braking, steering or taking evasive action, as otherwise there is a risk of an accident. 


10.2. Cruise control with braking function 

The cruise control with braking function is used in the 101 as standard equipment. The system is also 
referred to as "Dynamic Cruise Control" DCC. DCC supports the driver on roads with less traffic by 
keeping the speed constant irrespective of the rolling resistances (incline, vehicle load). In spite of 
the support, the driver remains responsible for control of the vehicle. It is possible to override the 
DCC function at any time by braking or accelerating the vehicle. It is operated via the left-hand switch 
block in the multifunction steering wheel. The current speed is saved by pressing the SET button. The 
speed is increased or reduced by 1 km/h /1 mph by tapping the rocker switch. Each time the rocker 
switch is pressed beyond the pressure point, the speed increases or reduces by 10 km/h / 6 mph. The 
DCC maintains a selected speed constant from approx. 30 km/h /18 mph. During downhill driving, the 
brake is activated if the vehicle's own deceleration is not enough to hold the preset speed. 

The adjustment range for the set speed has been limited to max. 150 km/h / 93 mph. 

When the ECO PRO or ECO PRO+ is activated, the cruise control is also set for a fuel-efficient driving 
style.

In the 101, the control functions in different control units are calculated depending on the optional 
equipment used. 

Vehicles with DCC: 

♦ The calculations are performed by the DSC control unit. 

♦ In vehicles that are equipped with an optional equipment control unit (SAS) due to other 
optional equipment packages, the calculations are performed in the SAS. 

10.3. Camera-based cruise control with Stop & Go + Active driving 
assistant function 

10.3.1. Control functions 

In the 101, the control functions in different control units are calculated depending on the optional 
equipment used. 

Vehicles with ACC Stop & Go + Active Driving Assistant (SA 5AT): 

♦ The calculations are performed in the optional equipment control unit SAS. 

Cruise control 

In principle, the cruise control in the ACC Stop & Go system works in exactly the same way as the 
Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) system. 

Distance control (ranging) 

The distance control is the core function of the ACC Stop & Go system. The driver can select a 
desired distance in four stages using two buttons on the multifunction steering wheel. ACC Stop & Go 
calculates the setpoint distance for the control from this preselection. 

The setpoint distance during the journey is proportional to the driving speed. At a lower driving speed 
and at standstill, the proportional distance to the driving speed is no longer used for the ACC Stop & 
Go, but a fixed value in metres. The distance control uses the prepared object data with the highest 
diagnostic statistic as input variables. The distance control takes into consideration the following 
situations in particular: 

♦ Maximum values for acceleration and deceleration: 


47 






101 Driver Assistance Systems 

10. Cruise Control 

The maximum values for acceleration and deceleration of the ACC Stop & Go system below 
approx. 50 km/h / 31 mph are dynamic values. They correspond to the acceleration values 
which the driver himself would use and considers comfortable. Depending on the situation, 
the ACC Stop & Go accelerates by a maximum of approx. 2 m/s 2 and decelerates by a 
maximum of approx. 4 m/s 2 . 

• Stop and start stability: 

In the case of very heavy traffic and very low driving speed, the risk of rear-end collisions 
increases through heavy acceleration and braking. The ACC Stop & Go distance controller is 
therefore designed so that it decelerates as early as possible, but not stronger than the vehicle 
ahead. The system can decelerate by up to 2.5 m/s 2 at the most during subsequent operation, 
and by up to 4 m/s 2 at the most when stopping. 

Road speed control when cornering 

The cruise control of the ACC Stop & Go on bends is based on the control characteristics of the 
Dynamic Cruise Control DCC. If an object is lost on bends, the system waits to see whether the object 
reappears (transition curve). The vehicle only accelerates if it does not reappear or the KAFAS camera 
no longer detects an object. Tight bends are detected via the data of the Dynamic Stability Control 
system DSC and the navigation system and the speed adjusted if necessary. 

10.3.2. Operation 

Activation and deactivation 

The activation and deactivation of the ACC Stop & Go and the Dynamic Cruise Control are almost the 
same. ACC Stop & Go cannot only be activated by the driver during the trip, but also when the vehicle 
is at a standstill, if the system detected another vehicle before its own vehicle. To activate ACC Stop 
& Go at standstill, the driver must press the brake pedal and at the same time press the SET or RES 
button.
