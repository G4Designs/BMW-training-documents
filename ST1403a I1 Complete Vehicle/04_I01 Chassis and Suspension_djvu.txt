1. Introduction 

1.1. Models 

The development code of the described vehicle is 101, similar to the F30 development code, the model 
designation is BMW i3. The 101 is the first mass produced BMW vehicle to be designed purely for 
electric driving. The associated changes (compared to a conventional vehicle) are not only limited 
to the use of new materials or the electrical machine. The chassis and suspension area was also 
systematically adapted to the overall concept. This training information provides an overview of the 
chassis and suspension as well as the suspension control systems, of the 101. 

Two different versions of the 101 are used: 

• A purely electric vehicle referred to as BEV (without range extender) 

• And an electric vehicle with range extender referred to as a REX. 

A combustion engine, also referred to as a Range Extender, is used to extend the range of the 
vehicle. The REX converts the energy stored in the fuel into electrical energy with the assistance of 
a generator. The voltage produced is then stored in the high-voltage battery unit of the 101 and, if 
required, used to power the vehicle.

A significant difference when compared to current BMW vehicles is the omission of a unitary body. 

In the 101, the Drive module (1) constitutes the supporting structure that connects the various 
chassis and suspension components. The Drive module (1) is made of aluminium and is permanently

101 Chassis and Suspension 

1. Introduction 


connected to the Life module which constitutes the passenger cell, among other things. This 
architecture has been chosen so that the large energy accumulator can be positioned optimally in 
the vehicle. The battery cells are fully integrated into the vehicle underbody and fill the entire central 
area of the Drive module (1); a favorable situation in terms of dynamic handling characteristics. This 
positioning guarantees optimum axle-load distribution and a low center of gravity. 

The single-joint spring-strut-type front axle (8) of the 101 is in principle similar to the front axle of 
a E46. A five-link rear axle HA5 (2), similar to the HA5 of a F30, is used. As the vehicle has been 
designed for urban traffic, it has an extremely small turning circle which is no more than 9.9 m. For 
comparison: the turning circle of a E46 is 10.5 m. 

The 101 features Electronic Power Steering (EPS) (6) and an electromechanical parking brake EMF 
(4) with additional functions. The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) (7), that performs several additional 
tasks is the core of the brake system. Furthermore, the tire pressure monitoring (TPMS) has been 
further developed and, in terms of function and operation, differs from the TPMS systems used up till 
now.

The front axle module (4) and rear axle module (3) are located at the Drive module. If damage occurs in 
the area of the front axle module or rear axle module, a structural repair of the relevant component can 
be carried out by a qualified BMW i Full Service outlet. 

A strut (6), two strut braces (5) and the two spring strut domes (7) are located in the area of the front 
axle module. The strut which is made of high-strength steel helps protect the occupants in the event 
of a head-on post crash due to its particularly high strength. The strut braces help increase the 
transverse rigidity of the vehicle. This can counteract the distortion of the front axle module, which can 
occur when cornering for example. In the event of a crash, the strut braces stabilize the attachment 
points of the spring strut domes. 

The V-struts (2) and cross-bracing (1) are located at the rear axle module. The purpose of these two 
strut sections is to increase the static and dynamic rigidity of the rear axle module. This prevents the 
camber and directional stability at the rear axle from being adversely affected. 

A_ 

Observe that a test drive with disassembled strut brace, pole strut, V-strut or cross-bracing is not 
permitted due to the lack of reinforcement in the Drive module.

Anti-roll bar 


The single-joint spring-strut-type front axle used in the 101 offers a high degree of ride comfort due to 
its low unsprung masses. 

The front axle support (5) is the core of the front axle and is bolted to the Drive module at several 
points. The stiffening plate (6) also connects the front axle to the Drive module in addition to the 
bolting points of the front axle support. This ensures the necessary rigidity of the front axle. The 
vehicle must not be driven without stiffening plate! The stiffening plate ensures transverse rigidity of 
the vehicle and increases, in combination with the front axle support, the rigidity of the front axle. 

A conventional anti-roll bar (17) reduces the rolling movement of the body, particularly during 
cornering. 

The swivel bearing (12) is screwed to the front axle support via the wishbone arm suspension (4) with a 
rubber mount for absorbing transverse forces (9) and a rubber mount for absorbing tensile forces (16). 

A_ 

Note that it is not permitted to carry out a test drive with the stiffening plate disassembled as the front 
axle will not be sufficiently rigid.

Front axle support for vehicles with range extender 


There are two different versions of the front axle support. If the vehicle is equipped with a range 
extender, there will be a total of four connections at the front axle support (2) for mounting the fuel 
tank. These connections do not exist in the version without range extender (1). The front axle support 
is bolted to the Drive module via six screws which can be replaced individually in Service, providing the 
damage is limited to the front axle support. Damage which affects the structure of the Drive module in 
addition to the front axle support must be rectified by a qualified BMW i Service Center.

The camber is defined by the wheel center plane and perpendicular to the roadway. The camber at 
the front axle cannot be adjusted. If the camber tolerances are exceeded, two different swivel bearing 
camber adjustments exist in Service for setting the camber (1,2) correctly. The swivel bearing camber 
adjustments (1,2) vary in terms of alignment of the shock absorber axis in relation to the wheel bearing 
bolt-on surface via which the camber of the vehicle is adjusted. This variation in this swivel bearing 
geometry allows the camber to be adjusted positively or negatively. 

The table below provides an overview of the different swivel bearing versions.

In addition, the swivel bearing on the left-hand side of the vehicle is not the same as the as the swivel 
bearing on the right-hand side of the vehicle. As a result, three different versions and six different part 
numbers exist in total.

101 Negative kingpin offset 



Index 

Explanation 

A 

Kingpin offset 

1 

Axis of movement

Wheel center axis 


The kingpin offset (A) is the lever arm at which the frictional forces arising between the tire and 
roadway engage. It is measured between the center of the tire contact area at the wheel center axis (2) 
and the point at which the extended axis of movement (1) passes through the roadway. 

In general, the kingpin offset (A) should be as small as possible to ensure that the influence of external 
forces on the steering is kept to a minimum. With the single-joint spring-strut-type front axle, the 
wheel guide joint of the wishbone arm suspension through which the axis of movement (1) passes 
largely influences the size of the kingpin offset (A). As the kingpin offset (A) should be as small as 


10 











101 Chassis and Suspension 

2. Axles 


possible, the wheel guide joint must be as far as possible to the outside. In addition to the axle concept 
and chassis adjustment, selecting rims with a suitable rim offset can also however achieve the required 
effect on the kingpin offset (A). 

A two-joint spring strut front axle, as used in the F30 for example, offers more installation space, in 
contrast with the single-joint spring-strut-type front axle of the 101. The additional joint brings about 
a virtual axis of movement. This means that, when compared to the single-joint spring-strut-type 
front axle, the two joints can be located further towards the inside. The installation space this gains is 
favorable for the brake system. 

Due to the following correlations, it was possible to use a single-joint spring-strut-type front axle with 
the 101. The rim offset of the wheel rims at the front axle of the 101 is 43 mm. By way of comparison, 
the rim offset of the wheel rims of a F22 228i is only 33 mm. This large rim offset shifts the tire tread 
surface further towards the center of the vehicle. This has the effect of also displacing the wheel 
center axis (2) towards the center of the vehicle. The kingpin offset (A) reduces accordingly. The 
necessary installation space for the brake system can also be ensured by using the 19" wheel rims in 
the base model and the 20" wheel rims which are available as optional equipment.

With the 101 however, a negative kingpin offset (5) has been chosen instead of a neutral kingpin offset 
(5). One of the reasons for this is the diagonal split braking system of the vehicle. 

A positive kingpin offset has the effect of tilting the wheel with more effective traction further towards 
the outside if the traction in the wheels during braking is not the same. The vehicle pulls over to one 
side as a result. 

With a negative kingpin offset it behaves in exactly the opposite manner. The wheel with the more 
effective traction produces a steering torque (M-|) which is directed inwards. When a brake circuit in 
the diagonal brake split system malfunctions, the wheel brake acts asymmetrically on the front axle 
(F x ). This causes a torque (M 2 ) build up around the center of gravity of the vehicle (3). This causes 
the vehicle to pull to the left. The torque at the wheel (M-|) produced by the negative kingpin offset (5) 
counteracts the torque at the vehicle (M 2 ). The two torques counteract one another thus reducing the 
tendency of the vehicle to pull to one side.

The 101 features the rear axle used for the first time in the E87 (E90 in the US), the HA5. This is an 
independent multi-link suspension with 5 different suspension arms. The name HA5 is however not 
derived from the different suspension arms, and instead stands for the ongoing development code at 
BMW. 

The wheel carrier (9) is guided by five rubber-mounted suspension arms. The positioning of the 
wheel carrier (9) can be modified via the track control arm (6) and camber control arm (8). The Service 
employee can adjust the camber and tracking with the assistance of the eccentric bolts (5, 7). 

A_ 

During wheel alignment, the nuts of the eccentric bolts must be replaced once they have been 
undone. When tightening the nuts, follow the specifications in the repair instructions.

equipped with a rubber mount which is pressed into the suspension arm on the wheel carrier side. 

2.2.1. Five-link rear suspension 

The purpose of the following illustration is to show the differences between a HA5 rear axle in the F30

Wheel carrier F30 


The five-link rear axle HA5 of the F30 consists of an axle support (6), the wheel carrier (7) and the five 
suspension arms. The axle support is bolted onto the body via four rubber mounts (4). The wheel 
carrier is connected to the axle support (6) via different suspension arms (5) on rubber bearings. This 
design ensures double damping between the body and the road. 

The five-link rear axle HA5 of the 101 consists of the rear axle module (1), the wheel carrier (3) and the 
five suspension arms. It was possible to further reduce the vehicle weight by omitting an anti-roll bar 
on the rear axle. 

Reasons for omission of an anti-roll bar: 

• The ideal location of the high-voltage battery unit 

• A high torsional rigidity of the rear axle module 

• A harder suspension and damping control. 

A low center of gravity due to the position of the high-voltage battery unit, high torsional rigidity of the 
rear axle module in conjunction with a harder suspension and damping control ensure low vehicle roll 
movements. 

The difference in weight between the two versions - with and without range extender - is 120 kg. This 
difference in weight is compensated for by varying the suspension and damping control. It has been 
possible to ensure that the drivability of the version with range extender remains on a par with the 
version without range extender. 

The wheel carrier of the 101 is screwed to the rear axle module directly via the five different suspension 
arms (2) with rubber bearings. It has therefore been possible to omit an axle support. The reduced 
vehicle weight in turn favorably affects the range. The body is damped once in the direction of the 
road. As an axle support with rubber mount has been omitted, the rubber mounts of the suspension 
arm of the 101 must meet more stringent demands. 

The sound waves produced by rolling and oscillations caused by unevenness in the road surface 
should not be transmitted to the Drive module. The Drive module is therefore decoupled via the 
various rubber mounts of the suspension arms at the rear axle. 


18 







101 Chassis and Suspension 

2. Axles 


Requirements to be met by the rubber mount: 

• Guarantee play 

• Guarantee zero wear 

• Dampen oscillations 

• Dampen sound waves. 

The following conflicting objectives therefore arise: The elasticity of the rubber mounts must be as 
high as possible in order to dampen the oscillations and sound waves. The elasticity must be as low 
as possible to guarantee the a low amount of play and therefore that the specified wheel alignment 
position will not change significantly. 

Measures for resolving conflict of objectives: 

• The sound waves and oscillations are further reduced due to the installation of comfort- 
optimized bearings with a high elasticity

Elasticity of rubber mount 


To achieve the necessary ride comfort, the elasticity of the rubber mounts used for mounting on axle 
constructions has been harmonised with the vehicle. Undesirable steering wheel movements occur 
when the vehicle is in motion in various driving situations due to the flexible rubber mounts between 
the rear axle module and wheel carrier. Steering angles (a) occur if forces act on the wheel and it 
moves out of the direction of travel by a steering angle (a) in the direction of the toe-in or toe-out.

The following forces can occur in this case: 

• Driving power 

• Brake forces 

• Lateral forces 

• Vertical forces. 

The above graphic shows flexible steering errors that occur during acceleration. As the driving power 
(C) that engages the driven wheel of the rear axle, tensile forces (E) act on the three suspension 
arms at the rear of the vehicle. Compressed forces (D) on the other hand are applied to the two front 
suspension arms. Due to the elasticity of the rubber mounts (a) at the various suspension arms, 
movement occurs within the rubber mount. This brings about a steering movement of the driven 
wheel. The vehicle deviates from its course as a consequence.

In the top view a triangle is visible above the two top suspension arms. The two lower suspension arms

The suspension arm center line of the bottom suspension arm pair (G) ends at the intersection of the 
bottom suspension arm pair (2). 

The intersections of the top and bottom suspension arm pairs (1,2) lie outside the wheel center plane

(1,2) results in the positive effect on drivability shown below.

The purpose of the above graphic is now to summarize the effects previously demonstrated. Its

As already described at the outset, the driving power (C) produces an inwards steering torque (M-|). In 
order to ensure the drivability of the vehicle remains stable, a steering torque must act in the opposing 
direction during the same period.

101 Chassis and Suspension

Due to the constructional position of the two intersection points of the top and bottom suspension 
arm pair (1,2) outside the wheel center plane (A), an outwards steering torque (M 2 ) occurs, e.g. when 
influenced by driving power (C), which counteracts the inwards steering torque (M-|) that is produced. 
The wheel remains in its predefined position. The drivability remains stable.

The front and rear axles of the (standard) 101 without range extender are equipped with the same tires 
and rim size (mixed tires are available as an option). If the vehicle is equipped with a range extender, 
mixed tires are standard in order to satisfy the higher demands in relation to driving dynamics due to 
the increased rear axle loads. By using 175/60 R19 tires, it has been possible to ensure that the driving 
dynamics of the 101 with range extender remain on a par with the driving dynamics of the 101 without 
range extender. This means that the drivability of the 101 is the same for each customer, irrespective of 
which vehicle version they drive. 

The expression driving dynamics is a very general term which can be broken down into various sub- 
areas. The following sub-areas must therefore be considered in order to compare the two vehicle 
versions. 


Subareas of driving dynamics: 

• Longitudinal dynamics 

Describes the vehicle behavior during acceleration and deceleration operations. The traction, 
braking deceleration and driving resistance, for example, are analyzed. 

• Transverse dynamics 

Describes the vehicle behavior during cornering. The steering behavior, directional stability 
and tilting tendency for example, are analyzed. 

• Vertical dynamics 

Describes the vehicle drivability over bumps. The effects on the comfort of the occupants and 
payload for example, are analyzed. 

If the 101 with range extender is converted for winter tires, R19 tires are also used at the rear axle 
155/70. 


26 







101 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Wheels 


Reasons for using the low tire width: 

• It was only possible to ensure sufficient freedom of movement when using snow chains with 
tire size 155/70 R19 

• Improved traction and braking deceleration on smooth or wet roads is achieved using 155/70 
R19 tires. 

Winter tires are not available for the optional equipment 20" wheel rim, also due to freedom of 
movement of the snow chains. 

The vehicle is equipped in all dimensions with rolling resistance optimized tires without emergency 
running properties. 

There is no spare wheel recess in the 101 therefore compact spare wheel for use in the event of 
a puncture is not provided. All US market vehicles come with a Mobility Kit included as standard 
equipment. 

Overall the omission of the spare wheel and use of tires without emergency running properties 
provides benefits in terms of reducing the vehicle weight and thus increasing the range. 


3.2. Tire pressures 

3.2.1. Physical principles 

Optimum adjustment of tire pressure is necessary for various reasons. 

Reasons: 

• Best possible driving dynamics 

• Maximum utilisation of tire service life 

• Increase in maximum ranges 

• Secure function of different puncture detection systems. 

For this, the physical principles should be observed in combination with pressure and temperature. 
The following rule of thumb applies in this case: A temperature change of 10 °C produces an increase 
in tire pressure of roughly 0.1 bar. 

3.2.2. Warm tire pressure 

A 

During longer journeys at higher driving speeds the tire warms up due to the friction with the road 
surface and tire creep. The temperature of the tire increases as a result and this is accompanied by an 
increase in tire pressure. If there is a significant difference between ambient temperature and tire air 
temperature this is always referred to as warm tire pressure. Avoid changing the tire pressures when 
the tire is warm. 


27 




101 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Wheels 

3.2.3. Cold tire pressure 

A 

If the tire air temperature is the same as the current ambient temperature, this is referred to as cold tire 
pressure. The tire pressures should only be changed with cold tire pressure. 


The tire pressures specified by the manufacturer apply for summer and winter operation, irrespective 
of the temperature. However, it must be observed that due to the seasonal temperature differences, 
the tire pressures should be frequently checked. The following figure shows the tire pressure curve as 
a function of the temperatures of the air in the tire. 



Index 

Explanation 

1 

Temperature of air in the tire in °C 

2 

Pressure in bar 


Observe the following when correcting the tire pressures: 

• Only change the tire pressures with cold pressure 

• Following each change in tire pressure, it is necessary to initialize the puncture detection 
systems. 

The purpose of the following example is to illustrate the problems arising from the correlations 
between temperature and pressure. 

The temperature of the air in the tire when filled at warm tire pressure was around 70 °C (1). The 
corrected tire pressure is now around 2.4 bar (2). Initialization of the new tire pressures has been 
completed successfully. Following a longer standstill period the tire cools down to the ambient 
temperature of 20 °C (1). This results in a temperature difference of 50 °C. Based on the tire pressure 
this results in a new value of 2.4 bar - 0.5 bar = 1.9 bar (2). 


28 













101 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Wheels 


If the vehicle is equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system TPMS, different warning threshold 
values apply. 

Warning threshold values: 

• If the tire pressure deviates by more than 20 % from the initialized nominal pressure 

• If the warning threshold value of 1.6 bar is undercut. 

As a consequence, a TPMS warning message is output if the deviation from the initialized nominal 
pressure is greater than 20 %. 

The correct tire pressures are stated on the driver's side in the rear door. 

If the tire is insufficiently filled, its rolling resistance will be higher which therefore contributes towards 
reducing the range of the 101.

The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) may also be referred to as RDC (Tire Pressure 
Control) in ISTA repair instructions and diagnostic material. TPMS is the term used for the US 
market version of RDC (Tire Pressure Control). 


Tire pressure monitoring is a system for monitoring the actual tire pressure of all four wheels. The 
latest version of TPMS is used in the 101. It is integrated into the DSC control unit (9). This means that 
a separate TPMS control unit is not required. 

The tire pressures and temperatures of the air in the tires are calculated by the tire pressure sensor 
(2, 4, 5, 7) at all four wheels and forwarded via radio signals. The radio signals from the tire pressure 
sensor are received by the remote control receiver (FBD) (1) and sent to the DSC control unit via 
FlexRay Bus signal the Body Domain Controller (BDC) (8). The evaluation function of the tire pressures 
takes place in the DSC control unit. The tire pressures can be displayed via the Central Information 
Display (CID). Warnings due to insufficient tire pressure are output via the CID or KOMBI (6).

The tire pressure sensor consist of a pressure and temperature sensor, the radio transmitter, a timer, 
a battery, the acceleration sensor and the valve unit (5) with sealing ring (6), union nut (7) and valve 
cap (8). The tire pressure sensors send messages at defined intervals via radio signals to the remote 
control receiver (FBD). One message contains several data logs with information on the identification 
number (ID) of the tire pressure sensor, the current tire pressure, the temperature of the air in the tire 
and the battery status. As the ID numbers are different, the system can differentiate between the 
various tire pressure sensors. 


31 

















101 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Wheels 


The tire pressure sensor are located inside the tire. The battery status of the tire pressure sensor 
should therefore be determined with the assistance of the diagnosis system ISTA before each tire 
change. If it is likely that the service life of the tire will exceed the service life of the battery, the tire 
pressure sensor must also be replaced. 

The tire pressure sensor used by BMW up till now cannot be used in the 101. The 101 features a new 
version of the tire pressure sensor. Therefore when replacing the tire pressure sensor on an 101, make 
sure that the correct version of the tire pressure sensor is installed. 

If the valve unit is leaking, a repair kit (4) is available in Service. This eliminates the high costs involved 
in replacing the complete tire pressure sensor. 

A_ 

Before fitting the tire, check that the battery capacity of the tire pressure sensor is sufficient. 

The TPMS will malfunction if the incorrect version of the tire pressure sensor is installed. 


Note for Service 

The service life of the batteries of the tire pressure sensor is roughly 10 years or 300,000 km. The 
current value of the service life counter, stated in years and months, can be read out with the help of 
the diagnosis system. 

A_ 

When removing/installing the tire pressure sensor, the following points must be observed: 

• When fitting the tire, make sure the sensor is in the correct position as specified in the repair 
instructions. 

• Do not use high pressure cleaners to clean the wheel rim with integrated tire pressure sensor 
when the tire has been removed. 

• Replace the tire pressure sensor if tire sealant has been used. 

• Clean the valve and valve seat thoroughly before installing the tire pressure sensor. 

• Do not use solvents or detergents on the tire pressure sensor. 

• Do not blow out the tire pressure sensor with compressed air. 

• To clean the tire pressure sensor, simply wipe down with a clean cloth.

101 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Wheels 


If a body is set in rotational motion (rotation is movement of a body around its own axis), forces arise 
due to the inertia. The axis of rotation, from where the acceleration and therefore the resulting force 
acts in all directions, lies at the center of the body. Based on this principle, the tire pressure sensor 
can determine whether the wheel is stationary or turning (1). The tire pressure sensor can be in the 
following modes. 

Modes of tire pressure sensor: 

• Sleep mode 

• Standby mode 

• Teach-in mode. 

An acceleration sensor is incorporated into each tire pressure sensor. If the acceleration sensor 
detects a stationary wheel, the tire pressure sensor switches to sleep mode. Messages are not sent to 
the remote control receiver (FBD) in sleep mode. This increases the service life of the batteries. 

As soon as the vehicle starts moving, forces act on the tire pressure sensor. This force increases as 
the driving speed increases. If a speed of roughly 30 km/h is exceeded, the force is high enough to be 
captured by the acceleration sensor of the tire pressure sensor. The tire pressure sensors change to 
standby or teach-in mode and start transmitting at a defined interval. 

The 12 o'clock position of the tire pressure sensor (2) can be determined in addition to the wheel 
rotation. An alternating force acts on the tire pressure sensor at the turning wheel. In the bottom 
valve position, the rotational movement of the wheel accelerates the tire pressure sensor towards the 
geocenter. The gravitational acceleration acts with 9.81 m/s 2 in the same direction which increases 
the force (4) acting on the tire pressure sensor. In the top valve position, the tire pressure sensor 
are accelerated away from the geocenter. The gravitational acceleration acts with 9.81 m/s 2 in the 
opposite direction, which reduces the force (3) acting on the tire pressure sensor. This effect means 
that the acceleration sensor in the tire pressure sensor can capture the force that is directed upwards 
(3). If the tire pressure sensor are in teach-in mode, the precise 12 o'clock position of the tire pressure 
sensor (2) is required.

For the measured tire pressures to be displayed at the Central Information Display (CID), the TPMS 
must have successfully completed a wheel assignment with the assistance of a teach-in operation. 
The teach-in operation comprises the following two phases. 

Phases of the teach-in operation: 

• Checking and storing the ID numbers of the tire pressure sensors assigned to the vehicle. 
Once the ID numbers have been successfully stored, the system is capable of issuing 
warnings. However, tire pressures still cannot be displayed. 

• Determine and store the various installation positions of the tire pressure sensors. 

Once the installation position has been successfully stored, the system is capable of issuing 
warnings and displaying tire pressures via the (CID). 

The teach-in operation starts automatically when the journey commences providing a standstill 
period of 8 min has been exceeded and cannot be influenced manually. The DSC control unit (11) 
launches a program as soon as the teach-in operation is active and serves to assign the wheels to the 
tire pressure sensor. In doing so, the wheel speed signals (9) from the wheel speed sensors (7) are 
compared with the messages (3) sent from the tire pressure sensor. As both signals are only available 
during the journey, this process must be performed dynamically. It is not possible to teach in when the 
vehicle is at a standstill. 

Each of the four wheel speed sensors (7) is connected to the DSC control unit via a hard-wire 
connection. This connection is generally referred to as a wheel speed sensor line (10). Each wheel 
speed sensor line connection with the DSC control unit is different. The different connections are 
referred to as channels. Each channel is assigned to the installation position of one of the four wheel 
bearing units. 

The channels are differentiated as follows: 

• Front axle on left 

• Front axle on right 

• Rear axle on left 

• Rear axle on right. 

As each of the wheel speed signals are only imported via the channel assigned to them, the DSC 
control unit knows the installation location of the wheel bearing unit (8). 

The four wheel bearing units are permanently bolted to the four wheels. If the wheels now turn at 
different wheel speeds (9) during cornering, the DSC control unit can determine the wheel speed and 
installation position of the four wheels based on the channel assignment. 


36 







101 Chassis and Suspension

The four different messages (3) from the tire pressure sensor must now be assigned to the appropriate 
wheel speed signal (9) and therefore the correct wheel. In teach-in mode, the messages (3) are only 
sent to the tire pressure sensors at a defined interval in the 12 o'clock position. This means that, 
although the four messages (3) are transmitted at different times, each wheel always transmits in the 
same position (12 o'clock). As a result, the following correlations exist between the wheel speed signal 
(9) and messages (3):

The multi-pole sensor gear of the ABS sensor (6) is subdivided into 48 increments. The DSC 
control unit can use the number of increments to determine the number of wheel rotations. The first 
increment is randomly specified at the start of the journey. The DSC control unit now counts each 
subsequent increment. The wheel has turned exactly one revolution once 48 increments have been 
counted. 

In teach-in mode, the messages transmitted are assigned an increment from between 1 and 48. After 
the start of the journey, the DSC control unit receives one message from each of the tire pressure 
sensors at staggered time intervals. The message and increment are assigned to one another if they 
arrive at the same time. An example of three successive increment assignment process for a wheel (A, 
B, C) is shown in the above graphic. This process runs simultaneously for all four wheels. However, to 
simplify the illustration, only the wheel at the front right wheel bearing unit (7) is considered. 

A maximum of 40 messages are transmitted in teach-in mode. The assignment must subsequently be 
complete. Of the 40 messages in total only 3 are shown in this example. 

Assignment of increments during the first message (A): 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 1 transmits at increment 15 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 2 transmits at increment 28 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 3 transmits at increment 37 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 4 transmits at increment 41. 

Assignment of increments during the second message (B): 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 1 transmits at increment 15 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 2 transmits at increment 48 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 3 transmits at increment 37 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 4 transmits at increment 28. 

Assignment of increments during the third message (C): 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 1 transmits at increment 15 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 2 transmits at increment 37 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 3 transmits at increment 01 

• Tire pressure sensor with ID 4 transmits at increment 41. 


38 







101 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Wheels 


Following evaluation of the three increment assignments (A, B, C) it is noticeable that only the tire 
pressure sensor with ID 1 is always transmitting at the same increment. The messages of the other 
three tire pressure sensors are each being transmitted at different increments. 

The IDs are shifting to the increments for the following reasons: 

• Differences in speed during cornering 

• Slip of wheels during straight-ahead driving and cornering. 

If a tire pressure sensor always sends at the same increment, this means it has a fixed mechanical 
connection with the wheel bearing unit of the wheel speed sensor. If a change in speed or slip occurs 
at the wheel it therefore has no effect. In our example, the tire pressure sensor with ID 1 (1) has a fixed 
connection with the front right wheel bearing unit (7). 

The wheel assignment for the tire pressure sensor with ID 1 is complete as the installation location 
front right has been identified.

• Tire pressure sensor ID 4 to rear axle right. 

It is possible to speed up the teach-in process by driving a winding route. This is because there is a 
much greater difference between wheel speeds during cornering when compared to straight-ahead 
driving. 

During the teach-in process, the vehicle must be driven for a few minutes at a speed higher than 
30 km/h. 

Faults in the tire pressure sensor of other vehicles are avoided as this process takes place dynamically 
during the journey. 

The tire pressures can be displayed in the CID as soon as the wheel assignment of all tire pressure 
sensors is complete. 

3.3.4. Transmission cycles of the tire pressure sensors 

The tire pressure sensor can be in three different modes. Sleep mode, teach-in mode or standby 
mode. The tire pressure sensors transmit their messages at different time intervals in teach-in and 
standby mode. 

To ensure that the wheel assignment works, a message is transmitted in teach-in mode at 16 s 
intervals when the tire pressure sensors are at the 12 o'clock position. How long the teach-in mode 
lasts depends on a number of factors. 

Factors influencing the duration of teach-in mode: 

• Tire pressure sensor IDs already identified 

• Tire pressure sensor IDs still unidentified 

• Route 

• Speed. 

Teach-in mode may therefore last from a few seconds up to 10 minutes at the most. The tire pressure 
sensor then switch to standby mode and transmit a message at 64 s intervals in any position. Standby 
mode remains active until the tire pressure sensors switch to sleep mode. The reduced transmission 
frequency in standby mode increases the battery service life of the tire pressure sensors while the high 
transmission frequency in teach-in mode ensures that the wheels are quickly assigned. 

The different modes of the tire pressure sensors can only be influenced to a limited extent. The 
following factors affect the modes. 


40 



101 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Wheels 


Influences on the modes: 

• When the wheel is stationary the tire pressure sensor switches to sleep mode 

• Following a standstill period of > 8 min, the tire pressure sensors begin transmitting in teach-in 
mode when the journey starts 

• Once teach-in mode has been successfully completed, or following a standstill period of < 

8 min, the tire pressure sensors transmit in standby mode when the journey starts. 

In order to rule out user errors, the TPMS operates fully automatically. Only the tire pressure 
initialization must be performed by the user manually. This gives rise to the following special aspects in 
Service. 

As soon as the vehicle is stopped, the TPMS is locked for 8 min in total. The positions of the tire 
pressure sensors are therefore permanently stored in the DSC control unit and cannot be changed. 
This prevents a teach-in process from being started each time the vehicle stops. As a wheel change 
within 8 min is highly unlikely, the tire pressure sensors transmit in standby mode once the journey 
starts. The tire pressures displayed are based on the wheel assignments most recently taught in. New 
tire pressure sensors with unknown identification numbers ID are not taken into consideration and 
cannot be taught in with this system status. 

If the standstill period is greater than 8 min, the positions of the wheels may have changed or new 
wheels with different tire pressure sensor may have been installed. If the system was not to respond to 
this state, a possible consequence would be that a puncture could not be detected or that the warning 
would be based on an incorrect installation position. For this reason, following a standstill period of 
> 8 min the tire pressure sensors transmit in teach-in mode at a driving speed of roughly 30 km/h. 
Parallel to this, the DSC control unit starts the wheel assignment program. It takes less time to teach in 
an ID of the tire pressure sensor that is already known than it would to teach in a new unknown ID. 

A_ 

When changing a wheel of the 101, make sure that the vehicle is stationary for at least 8 min before 
initializing the tire pressures. 


3.3.5. Functional prerequisites 

To ensure that the TPMS issues correct a warning in the event of a pressure drop, an initialization with 
the tire pressures set correctly must be performed manually. 

Prerequisites for an initialization are: 

• All four wheels equipped with correct version of tire pressure sensor 

• Sufficient energy in the batteries of the tire pressure sensors 

• Prescribed tire pressures at all four wheels. 

An initialization can be started at any time. However, it is only performed upon completion of the wheel 
assignment by the TPMS . 


41 




101 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Wheels 


The following threshold values are stored in the system: 

• Initialization threshold; when the minimum pressure of 2.0 bar is undercut during initialization 
the “Tire pressure too low” warning is issued 

• First warning threshold value with a pressure drop of 20 % compared to the initialized nominal 
pressure 

• Second warning threshold when 1.6 bar is undercut. 


3.3.6. Initializing the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) 

The TPMS is initialized via the Drive menu. 

The tire pressures must be initialized if: 

• The tire pressures have been changed 

• A tire change has been carried out 

• The tire pressure sensor have been exchanged. 

The initialization ends with a journey that can be interrupted at any time. When the journey continues, 
the process is automatically resumed. In order to complete it, a speed of more than 30 km/h must 
be attained. If no measuring results are available, the wheels in the Central Information Display 
will be displayed grey. A progress bar appears in the CID during the initialization process. Once 
the initialization has been completed successfully, all four wheels will be displayed green with the 
corresponding tire pressures. 

A 

To ensure the system works reliably, an initialization must be performed following each wheel change 
or tire pressure adjustment. 


3.3.7. Information in Central Information Display 

As the tire pressure sensor are in sleep mode when the vehicle is at a standstill, the actual tire 
pressures cannot be queried via the Central Information Display. As soon as the vehicle is in 
motion and exceeds a speed of roughly 30 km/h, the tire pressure sensors start transmitting. If the 
identification numbers ID are stored in the DSC control unit, the tire pressures can be displayed in the 
CID. 

The tire and system statuses are indicated by different colors of wheels and a text message. The 
following illustration shows how the different system statuses are displayed in the CID.

Internally ventilated brake discs are used on the front axle of the 101. Due to the low thermal loads, the 
brake discs on the rear axle do not have internal ventilation. It has been possible to reduce the weight 
of the brake discs and brake pads by using less material. Normally, if less material is used the service 
requirements are higher as the components reach their wear limits more quickly. 

By harmonizing the accelerator pedal operation with the 101, braking decelerations of up to 1.6 m/s 2 
can be performed purely electrically and thus wear-free via the electrical machine. This means that the 
wear of the brake discs and brake pads will be extremely low, providing a forward-thinking driving style 
is adopted. The reduction in weight in turn has a favorable effect on the range.

In contrast to current hybrid vehicles, the 101 is not equipped with a brake pedal angle sensor. Due to 
the special accelerator pedal operation, the electrical machine (8) is regeneratively actuated by the 
electrical machine electronics EME (3) when exiting the accelerator pedal module (1). This means that 
the wheels at the rear axle of the 101 now drive the electrical machine, which now acts as the generator, 
via the propeller shafts (11). The resulting torque of the electrical machine acts on the wheels of the 
rear axle to produce a tangible deceleration. The brake pedal does not have to be operated during 
process. The energy produced is stored in the high-voltage battery unit (4) via the EME. This means 
that, in contrast to the current hybrid vehicles, the recuperative braking (C) is controlled via the 
accelerator pedal module and not via the brake pedal. Hydraulic braking (A) is possible using the brake 
pedal only. 

The Electrical Digital Motor Electronics control unit (EDME) (2) requests and controls the recuperative 
braking (C). If the accelerator pedal module is fully released during the journey, the EDME determines 
the maximum energy recovery according to the driving condition. With maximum energy recovery the 
vehicle is decelerated with 1.6 m/s 2 . The request is transmitted to the EME via the PT-CAN2. The EME 
now controls the electrical machine according to the specifications of the EDME. 

The EDME has a separate interface (5) with the FlexRay data bus. The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 
(7) can be found in this bus system. The task of the DSC is to detect unstable driving conditions and 
take appropriate measures to keep the vehicle safely on course. When an unstable driving situation 
is detected during energy recovery, the DSC transmits information on an imminent critical driving 
condition via the separate interface (5). The EDME determines how the maximum energy recovery is 
to be adapted to the critical driving condition and transmits the request accordingly to the EME. Based 
on this request, the EME reduces the energy recovery and therefore the deceleration. This control is 
referred to as engine drag torque control (MSR). 

As with conventional braking systems, when the brake pedal is operated in the 101, pressure builds 
up in the hydraulic system of the dual-circuit brake system. The braking of the vehicle is now based 
entirely on energy recovery by the electrical machine and operation of the wheel brakes.

Mineral oils can damage the rubber seals of the brake system. You must therefore not use extractors 
containing mineral oils when drawing off excess brake fluid. 


4.2.2. Brake circuit bleeding 

Until now, the hydraulics of the brake system in BMW vehicles were bled via the BMW diagnosis 
system ISTA following the exchange of the DSC unit using a special brake bleeding procedure. This 
measure was necessary to ensure that no air was left in the DSC unit. Various valves and the return 
pump were actuated in a precisely defined sequence during the brake bleeding procedure in order to 
support the bleeding process. 

It has been possible to omit a brake bleeding procedure in the 101 by ensuring that the DSC hydraulic 
control units are perfectly pre-filled. The hydraulics of the brake system in the 101 must simply be bled 
conventionally once the DSC unit has been exchanged, without using the BMW diagnosis system. 
This saves time and reduces costs for the Service of the 101. 

For the detailed procedure when exchanging the DSC unit, refer to the current repair instructions. 

4.2.3. Brake pad wear indicator 

The 101 is currently not equipped with a Condition Based Service display for brake pad wear. The 
remaining brake pad thickness must therefore be determined manually in Service. Single-stage brake 
pad wear sensors are installed on the front left and rear right wheel brakes. As soon as the conductor 
path of the brake pad wear sensor has worn out due to reaching its wear limit, a Check Control symbol 
is displayed for the driver in the instrument cluster (KOMBI). Once the wear limit has been reached, 
roughly 5 % (range of roughly 2000 km) of the brake pad thickness is available. 

The Check Control symbol is displayed in red with the text message "Brake" in the US market once 
the brake pad wear limit has been reached.

The brake pedal force of the brake pedal (3) is supported by using a brake servo (4). The necessary 
vacuum for the brake servo is generated according to the requirements by an electrical vacuum pump 
(6). To ensure that sufficient brake power assistance is available at all times, a brake vacuum sensor (5) 
is fitted to the brake servo of the 101 in order to monitor the available vacuum. 


53 
















101 Chassis and Suspension 

4. Braking System 

The brake vacuum sensor is designed as a differential pressure sensor that measures the existing 
vacuum in the brake servo relative to existing atmospheric pressure. The sensor operates according 
to the strain gauge principle. There are three electrical connections at the brake vacuum sensor. The 
5 V voltage supply, the ground connection and the signal line. The extent of deformation of the strain 
gauges varies depending on the vacuum in the brake servo. Their resistance changes, depending on 
the extent of deformation. This means that the resistance increases and the signal voltage decreases 
as the vacuum increases. 

The electrical machine electronics EME (1) evaluates this signal for the purpose of activating the 
electrical vacuum pump according to the requirements. This requirements-oriented activation saves 
energy and therefore contributes towards extending the range of the vehicle. 

If a fault develops, this is communicated to the Dynamic Stability Control (7). In this case, 
communication between the electrical machine electronics EME and the DSC is effected via the Body 
Domain Controller (BDC) (2).

The brake vacuum sensor (1) receives voltage from the electrical machine electronics EME and sends 
back a voltage signal which depends on the vacuum in the brake servo. This analog sensor signal 
is processed by the EME which decides based on the sensor signal and various dynamic handling 
characteristics, such as the driving speed, whether the vacuum pump is to be switched on. In addition, 
the function logic in the EME takes a hysteresis into account so that the electrical vacuum pump is not 
continuously switched on and off. Instead, it remains switched on until the brake vacuum reaches a 
required minimum level. 

The EME incorporates an output stage (semiconductor relay) which assists with switching the 12V 
supply voltage of the electrical vacuum pump on and off. When switching on, the output voltage of 
the DC/DC converter is connected directly to the electrical vacuum pump. Switch-on currents of up 
to 30 A can occur during this process. To protect the output stage and the cable, the current level is 
limited electronically. The power or speed of the electrical vacuum pump is not controlled. Instead, it is 
only switched on and off. 

System faults can have the following consequences: 

• When the brake vacuum sensor malfunctions, the EME receives no information about the 
vacuum in the brake servo. The electrical vacuum pump is now activated based on information 
such as the brake pressure or the brake light switch from the Dynamic Stability Control. As 
requirements-oriented control is no longer possible without the sensor signal from the brake 
vacuum sensor, the EME switches the electrical vacuum pump on and back off according to a 
time pattern when it detects a braking requirement. 

• If the electrical vacuum pump malfunctions, there is no other option for the EME to create 
a vacuum for the brake servo. When a braking request is detected, a DSC subfunction is 
then activated to compensate for the lack of brake power assistance. A hydraulic (instead of 
vacuum-based) brake-servo assistance is now being implemented with the help of the DSC. 
This DSC function is activated automatically. 

If system faults occur, the EME arranges for a Check Control message to be displayed at the 
instrument cluster (KOMBI) to inform the driver about the fault status. 

In the US version, system faults are indicated by the symbol shown below. 



101 Check Control symbol for US version when the vacuum supply malfunctions 

If this fault occurs, the brake pedal travel and brake pedal force are not the same as they would be in 
the normal condition. However, the customer can still decelerate the vehicle safely using the brake 
power assistance, and also use the DSC if required for stabilizing interventions.

Although initially inductive sensors were predominantly used to determine the wheel speeds for an 
ABS control operation in older vehicles, currently the significance of active sensors are increasing 
more and more. Wheel speed signals are not just used for an ABS control operation, they are also 
used by a large number of other systems such as the engine, transmission, navigation, or suspension 
control systems. The 101 is equipped with four active wheel speed sensors (2) which the DSC control 
unit can use to determine the current wheel speeds. The wheel bearing unit (1) can only be replaced 
completely. This means it is no longer possible to mix-up the installation position of the multi-pole 
sensor gear (3). The active wheel speed sensor captures the speed and, depending on the equipment 
specification (see the following table), also the direction of rotation of the multi-pole sensor gear. 

With the active wheel speed sensors a distinction is made between sensors with and sensors without 
rotational detection. 

The hole pattern of the wheel hub on the wheel bearing unit is 5 x 112 mm. Due to the new hole- 
circle diameter, Service requires a modified clamping adapter to clamp the wheel rims on a balancing 
machine. 

The drive shaft is connected to the wheel bearing unit via the spur gearing (4). 

The table below provides an overview of the different wheel speed sensors that are available with the 
various equipment specifications.

In order to perform their function, different assist systems require information on the wheel speed, 
wheel standstill (3) and the direction of rotation (2). This information is transferred from the wheel 
speed sensor with rotational direction detection to the DSC control unit using a data log (Manchester 
code). The information wheel turning (1) is output via a level of 28 mA. The information direction of 
rotation (2) is output via a level of 14 mA. If the wheel is stationary (3), the 28 mA level also falls to 
14 mA. The wheel speed is determined via the signal frequency. 

4.2.6. Brake test stand 

If the vehicle is decelerated in traffic via the service brake, the braking power is the combined power 
of the electrical machine and service brake. For the wheels of the rear axle to turn freely on the brake 
test stand, the gear shift lever must be brought into the neutral position. The electrical machine is not 
activated in the neutral position and can run freely. This means that torques do not act on the drive 
train.

The difference between the electromechanical parking brake of the 101 and the systems used up till 
now is that a separate control unit is not required. The electromechanical parking brake is activated 
via the DSC control unit (1). There is a parking brake button (3) on the center console for activating 
or deactivating the electromechanical parking brake. The driver is informed about the current system 
status via the instrument cluster (KOMBI) (2). 


60 










101 Chassis and Suspension 

4. Braking System 

The brake pad is applied with a precisely calculated preload force via two actuators screwed to the 
brake calipers (4, 5). A temperature model is stored in the DSC control unit which makes it possible 
to draw conclusions about the brake disc temperatures. As the contact pressure reduces as the 
brake disc cools down, the system must retention the brake pads, particularly when a sporty driving 
style is adopted. The time and frequency of retentioning varies depending on the initial temperature 
calculated. When the electromechanical parking brake is opened, the actuators (4, 5) are only moved 
back until the brake pads reach the correct air gap setting. Due to this readjustment function, the 
actuators (4, 5) must be moved back before exchanging the brake pads in Service. For the detailed 
procedure, refer to the current repair instructions. 

Advantages of an electromechanical parking brake: 

• More storage space due to the omission of a parking brake lever and parking brake Bowden 
cable 

• Contact pressure of brake pads correctly adjusted at all times 

• Different additional functions for support of driver 

• Higher braking power of auxiliary brake system. 


4.3.2. Functions 

Dynamic emergency braking 

When using electrical parking brake systems, an emergency braking function is prescribed by law. This 
so-called auxiliary brake system must perform the function of the service brake system with reduced 
effectiveness if it fails. This does not have to be a third independent brake system; instead either the 
still intact brake circuit of a dual-circuit service brake or the parking brake can be used as an auxiliary 
brake. When using the parking brake this must however be gradual. 

If the parking brake button is operated during the journey above a defined driving speed, the DSC 
unit initiates a dynamic emergency braking operation. The activation of the 2-piston pump and 
changeover valves in the DSC unit causes a pressure build-up at all four wheel brakes. The slip limits 
of all wheels are monitored with the assistance of the four wheel speed sensors to ensure a stable 
braking operation until the vehicle comes to a standstill. The two actuators of the electromechanical 
parking brake are activated as soon as the vehicle comes to a standstill. Now only the parking brake 
secures the vehicle to prevent it from rolling away. 

An innovation of the dynamic emergency braking function, which is therefore being used for the 
first time with BMW, is that when the 2-piston pump in the DSC unit malfunctions a controlled 
deceleration of the vehicle takes place via the actuators of the electromechanical parking brake. 
Controlled deceleration means that the slip limits of the rear axle are monitored via the wheel speed 
sensors. If these are exceeded and an unstable driving situation occurs as a result, the actuators of the 
electromechanical parking brake of the DSC control unit are released until the performance values for 
slip at the rear wheels are once again stable. This new function contributes towards a further increase 
in driving safety for the customer. 


Automatic release of the parking brake 

This function allows the driver to drive off when the parking brake is applied without operating the 
parking brake button.

Brake test stands can serve as performance or brake test stands. When carrying out some checks, it 
may be necessary to activate the test stand mode, depending on the system being checked. The test 
stand mode can be activated via the instrument cluster (KOMBI) (1). 

Procedure for activating the test stand mode: 

• Terminal 15 on (3) 

Instrument cluster (KOMBI) is switched on (1) 

• Press reset button for 10 s (2) 

The submenu for selection of different functions (4) subsequently appears 

• Press reset button briefly twice (2) 

The test stand mode is now marked (5) 

• Press reset button and hold pressed (2) 

Test stand mode is now selected (6) 

• Press reset button briefly (2) 

The test stand mode is activated (7) 

Once test stand mode has been activated, the text message "Test operation ends at the start of the 
journey" appears in the instrument cluster (KOMBI). When the test stand mode is activated, all DSC 
functions are deactivated. This is also displayed to the driver by the DSC indicator and warning light at 
the instrument cluster (KOMBI). 

The test stand mode can be deactivated manually via a terminal change or automatically by exiting the 
test stand. Before the test stand mode is automatically deactivated, the steering angle, longitudinal 
acceleration and yaw rate of the vehicle are evaluated. When the stored values that would occur when 
driving normally are exceeded, test stand mode is switched off automatically. The text message "Test 
operation ends at start of the journey" goes out to indicate when test stand mode is deactivated. The 
full functionality of the DSC can only be restored by changing terminal.

4.3.4. Brake test stand 

The 101 has a test stand mode for checking the braking power of the electromechanical parking brake 
on a brake test stand. The test stand mode must be activated manually via the Service menu in the 
instrument cluster. Automatic rolling detection is not possible. When the test stand mode is activated, 
the vehicle is decelerated via the actuators of the electromechanical parking brake when the parking 
brake button is pressed. A DSC pressure build-up in all four wheel brakes does not occur. This makes 
it possible to determine the brake forces of the electromechanical parking brake. 

Once test stand mode has been activated and the speed of the wheels on the rear axle is higher than 
3 km/h, the system is in test stand mode. The parking brake indicator light of the electromechanical 
parking brake EMF acknowledges this status by flashing at a frequency of 1 hertz. The EMF can 
be engaged in five stages with the assistance of the parking brake button. In this case, the braking 
varies between the minimum braking power in the first stage and the maximum braking power once 
the parking brake button has been pressed five times. If the button is operated continuously, the 
system increases the braking power automatically incrementally up to the maximum braking power. 
The flashing frequency of the parking brake indicator light changes from 1 hertz to 3 hertz when the 
parking brake button is pressed in test stand mode.

The Service employee can, with the assistance of the diagnosis system ISTA, put the 
electromechanical parking brake EMF in workshop mode. When workshop mode is activated, the 
spindle (11) in the floating caliper (6) is moved back as far as it will go. This allows the brake piston (13) 
to be turned back mechanically. The above figure shows the spindle and the brake piston moved back 
as for as they will go. The parking brake button is blocked to prevent injury due to incorrect operation 
in Service. 

Exiting workshop mode: 

• Manual 

The service employee deactivates the workshop mode manually via the service function. 

• Automatic 

A driving speed of 5 km/h has been exceeded. 

When carrying out various servicing tasks, it may be necessary to teach in the electromechanical 
parking brake EMF again by performing an initialization run. 

The initialization run must be performed after carrying out the following work: 

• Workshop mode has been exited 

• The DSC control unit was replaced. 

The purpose of the initialization run is to adjust the travel distance of the spindle in the floating caliper. 
This can be done manually without the assistance of the diagnosis system ISTA. For this, the parking 
brake button must be operated once when operating the foot brake. A "close-open-close" activation 
of the actuators of the electromechanical parking brake is subsequently performed. The control unit 
detects based on the power consumption when the brake pad is fully in contact with the brake disc. 
The spindle is then only opened wide enough to allow the brake disc to turn freely. In the final step, the 
parking brake is fully applied. If the footbrake is released during the initialization run, the initialization 
run stops and the note "Apply footbrake. Release parking brake. The initialization run must then be 
restarted. If the initialization run is not performed, the yellow parking brake indicator light lights up in 
the display.

The Electronic Power Steering of the 101 is a 12 V steering with a maximum assistance power of 
0.3 kW. The EPS unit consists of the EPS control unit and an AC electric motor. The 12V direct 
current voltage is converted with the assistance of an inverter inside the component to a three- 
phase AC voltage which activates the electric motor. The steering assistance takes place via the 
EPS unit parallel to the input shaft (5). This arrangement of the EPS unit is possible due to the low 
wheel contact force at the front axle and saves installation space in contrast to the axially-parallel 
arrangement which is the preferred choice for vehicles with high wheel contact forces at the front axle. 

To prevent condensate from forming inside the component due to fluctuating temperatures, there 
is a ventilation outlet in the housing (6) next to the input shaft (5). This protects the electronics from 
damage. 

The EPS components that can be replaced individually in Service are the gaiters (9), the track rods (10) 
and the track rod ends (1). However, it is not possible to exchange the EPS control unit or the electric 
motor separately.

The steering torque assistance of the EPS depends on the driver's choice, i.e. the torque at the 
steering wheel (manual torque). In order to be able to precisely calculate an assistance torque (drive 
torque of the electric motor) from the manual torque, this is measured via a torque sensor (1). The 
torque sensor is located between the input shaft (2) and the pinion shaft (3). Other factors that 
influence the steering assistance are the static friction between the road surface and tires and the 
driving speed.

The input shaft and pinion shaft are not rigidly connected. The two shafts are connected by a torsion 

bar spring that allows a maximum rotation of 8°. The above illustration is an example which shows 
a maximum rotation of both shafts in relation to one another of 30° at the input shaft and 22° at 
the pinion shaft. A rotor (1,4) is mounted on each shaft. There are 6 permanent magnets on the 
rotor of the input shaft (1), and special contours (5) on the rotor of the pinion shaft (4). If both rotors 
(1,4) are turned in opposing directions via the torsion bar spring, the position of the contours (5) 
changes in relation to the position of the magnetic fields of the permanent magnet (2). The change 
of magnetic field is recorded via several hall effect elements in the sensor unit (6) and forwarded via 
two redundant voltages (7) to the EPS control unit. The EPS control unit can determine the amount of 
steering assistance based on this voltage and information on the current driving speed. In this case, 
the maximum rotational angle (8) of 8° represents the greatest amount of steering assistance. As the 
rotational angle decreases, the steering assistance also reduces taking the current driving speed into 
account. 

* although securely clamped at both ends, a torsion bar spring can be turned in opposing directions 
of rotation at the clamping points. In this case, the torsional force increases as the rotational angle 
increases.

The information on the steering angle in the 101 is not captured by a separate sensor at the steering 
wheel and is instead computed back to the steering wheel based on the position angle of the rotor (4) 
in the electric motor of the EPS unit. 

The electric motor in the EPS unit consists of a fixed part, the stator (2), and a rotating part, the rotor 
(4). The electric motor of the EPS unit contains a rotor position angle sensor (3) which determines the 
precise position of the rotor from 0° to 360°. An additional rotor position sensor (not shown) delivers 
a redundant signal which is used to check the plausibility of the first signal. A large ratio, which has 
the favorable effect of producing a high amplification ratio, is achieved with the assistance of the 
worm drive (5) which is permanently connected to the electric motor of the EPS unit. In this case the 
electric motor of the EPS unit turns several times through 360° in order to traverse the entire section 
of the rack (10) that the rotor angle sensor (3) can record. In order for the EPS control unit to be able 
to calculate all steering wheel positions, the number of complete revolutions of the rotor (4) are also 
counted. The EPS control unit can implement the following functions using the current steering angle, 

Functions with the assistance of the steering angle: 

• Software function for reproducing the end stops 

The rack limit stop on the left and right are reproduced via the software (6,8). These 
reproduced end stops are determined during the start-up routine and stored in the control 
unit. This function helps protect the mechanism against premature wear by applying a 
counter-torque before the corresponding end stop is reached. 

• Active steering return 

When exiting a bend, the active steering return brings the steering back to the straight-ahead 
position as soon as the driver no longer applies torque. 

These functions are deactivated when the steering angle is lost. The driver is only informed about this 
status if a stored speed range is exited without a stored steering angle. 

The following values are stored in the EPS control unit for the purpose of determining the steering 
angle. 

Stored values in the EPS control unit: 

• Geometrical center of rack (7) 

• Straight-ahead value (9) 

• Value for number of rotor revolutions. 

The geometrical center of the rack is stored in the EPS control unit by the steering manufacturer 
(Nexteer) during installation and cannot be changed.

101 Chassis and Suspension 

5. Steering 

Due to production-related tolerances, the electromechanical power steering must be taught in at 
the BMW service workshop once it has been installed. This taught-in straight-ahead value is based 
on the geometric center of the rack specified by the manufacturer. Depending on the size of the 
manufacturing tolerance, the straight-ahead value will deviate by several degrees to the left or right 
from the geometric center of the rack. The straight-ahead value can be stored in the EPS control 
unit in Service with the assistance of the BMW diagnosis system ISTA using the "Start-up" service 
function. Once stored, this value will not be deleted if the vehicle voltage is lost and can be overwritten 
as often as is required. The straight-ahead value must also be overwritten if the position of the steering 
has been changed by undoing the mounting bolts. 

In order for the EPS control unit also to be able to calculate the position of the steering wheel once the 
steering wheel has been turned several times to the left or right (11,12), the revolutions of the rotor 
(4) must be counted at all times once the straight-ahead value (9) has been successfully stored. The 
number of revolutions of the rotor is based on the stored straight-ahead value. The EPS control unit 
uses the number of rotor revolutions and the motor position angle to identify the precise position of 
the pinion shaft between the rack limit stops on the right and left (6, 8). If the voltage supply is lost, the 
value for the number of rotor revolutions is lost and must be taught in once again. 

If the number of rotor revolutions is lost, the steering angle can be set up again using two different 
teaching routines. 

Teaching routine for setting up the steering angle: 

• Static 

With the ignition switched on, turn the steering wheel from the center position to the rack limit 
stop on the right (6), to the rack limit stop on the left (8) then back to the center position. 

• Dynamic: 

1. Rough value: The steering angle was calculated based on a short straight-ahead driving 
route at a driving speed of < 18 km/h with a precision of +/- 30° (approx. 2 revolutions of the 
rotor). 

2. Precise value: The steering angle was determined on a short straight-ahead driving route at 
a driving speed of < 60 km/h with a precision of+/- 7.5°. 

With static teaching of the steering angle, the revolutions of the rotor (4) are counted by the EPS 
control unit and stored. 

With dynamic teaching of the steering angle, the wheel speeds of the wheels on the rear axle, the yaw 
rate and the lateral acceleration are evaluated. If these values are within the stored tolerances over a 
short distance travelled, the steering angle is saved in the EPS control unit. 

The steering angle is however also an important variable for calculating a wide range of DSC functions. 
The EPS control unit therefore sends the information on the steering angle to the Dynamic Stability 
Control (DSC) control unit via the FlexRay data bus. If it was not possible to determine the steering 
angle to the required degree of accuracy, the DSC indicator and warning light is activated if the driving 
speed of 18 km/h or 60 km/h is exceeded. This tells the driver that the various DSC functions are only 
operational to a limited extent. If the steering angle is determined dynamically during the course of the 
journey, the DSC functions are available again. This could for example occur if a customer has replaced 
the battery of the low-voltage vehicle electrical system and exits the speed range of 18 km/h or 60 km/ 
h too quickly.

5.1.3. Service information 

To relieve the load on the battery, the vehicle is delivered in transport mode. This means that the 
steering angle is not stored in the EPS control unit and must be set up again by the Service personnel 
with the assistance of the teaching routine. 

The steering Check Control symbol lights up in the instrument cluster to indicate system faults in the 
Electronic Power Steering. 

Possible reasons for illumination of the Check Control symbol: 

• Fault in the EPS control unit, an integrated sensor or in the electric motor 

• Software error in the EPS control unit 

• Overtemperature threshold of EPS has been reached 

• Undervoltage or overvoltage protection level reached 

• Malfunction of external signals affecting the steering assistance 

• Steering angle not taught in correctly or completely.

The EPS a prerequisite for implementation of the Parking Maneuvering Assistant PMA. The EPS 
steering has a voltage range of between 9 V and 16 V. If a fault occurs which causes a drop in the 
supply voltage, the current level is increased to compensate for the loss of power. To protect the 
system, the steering assistance is switched off if the supply voltage is less than 9 V or higher than 
16 V. 

A 

If the EPS has been replaced or its mounting bolts have been undone, the "Start-up" service function 
must be run with the assistance of the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 

If the 12V supply voltage to the EPS is lost, the steering angle must be taught in statically or 
dynamically. 

Once transport mode has been deactivated, the steering angle must be taught in statically or 
dynamically. 

If the steering angle is lost, the DSC functions are only operational to a limited extent.

6.1.1. Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) control unit must acquire and process a large quantity of 
information such as wheel speeds, steering angle and yaw rate in order to support the driver 
if necessary through systematic brake intervention. The evaluation of the various signals and 
requirements of the measures derived were adopted by the Integrated Chassis Management ICM in 
a number of BMW vehicles. In the 101 this task is performed by the DSC control unit. The 101 is not 
equipped with an ICM control unit. The DSC in the 101 cannot be fully deactivated.

6. Driving Stability Control 

6.1.2. Electronic Power Steering (EPS) 

Voltage is supplied to the Electronic Power Steering (EPS) of the 101 via the 12V vehicle electrical 
system. The EPS delivers information on the current steering angle and puts this on the FlexRay data 
bus. Other control units, such as the DSC control unit, can access this information. The EPS control 
unit is located directly at the Electronic Power Steering (EPS). 

6.1.3. Crash Safety Module (ACSM) 

The function of the Crash Safety Module ACSM is to permanently evaluate all sensor signals in order 
to identify a crash situation. The ACSM records the yaw rate and puts this information on the FlexRay 
data bus. Other control units, such as the DSC control unit, can access this data. The advantage of this 
data exchange is that the number of hardware components are reduced to a minimum and the same 
information is processed. The ACSM is located on the vehicle tunnel at the height of the driver's seat. 
The position on the vehicle center axis allows the forces acting on the vehicle to be determined more 
precisely. 


6.1.4. SAS 

Depending on the equipment options the vehicle can be equipped with a SAS (optional equipment 
system control unit). If installed, the SAS control unit is located in the rear passenger compartment 
of the vehicle under the seat bench. Similar to the ICM on current BMW vehicles, the SAS connects 
the chassis and suspension control systems to the assist systems. The following functions can be 
implemented with the assistance of the control unit. 

Functions with the assistance of the control unit: 

• Camera-based collision warning 

• Collision warning with city braking function 

• Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

• Proactive driving assistant 

• Parking manoeuvring assistant 

• Cruise control with braking function 

• Camera-based cruise control with Stop&Go function 

• Traffic jam assistant.

The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) forms the core of the vehicle control systems that enhance 
active safety. It optimizes driving stability in all driving conditions and also traction when driving off 
and accelerating. Furthermore, it identifies unstable driving conditions such as understeering or 
oversteering and helps maintain the vehicle on a steady course. 

The designation of the DSC unit of the 101 is MK100. It comprises the DSC control unit (2) and DSC 
hydraulic control unit (3). The DSC control unit is connected to the DSC hydraulic control unit using 
three screws and can be replaced separately in Service. 

Two versions of the DSC are available for the 101: 

• Basic version 

• Version for vehicles with active cruise control ACC. 

The DSC hydraulic control unit of both versions comprises a hydraulic block, the solenoid valves, a 
digital pressure sensor and an electric motor (4) for the drive of the 2-piston pump. In contrast to the 
basic version, the version for vehicles with ACC is equipped with special pulsation damping elements 
which compensate for pressure fluctuations of the 2-piston pump when the pressure is building up.

6.2.2. DSC functions 


The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) takes the transverse dynamics into account in addition to the 
longitudinal dynamic forces of the ABS anti-lock brake systems via additional sensor systems. Due to 
further developments in the meantime, the ABS and DSC functions now have many subfunctions.

Engine drag torque control (MSR) 

In the overrun phase, some of the kinetic energy of the 101 is converted to electrical current via the 
electrical machine and fed to the high-voltage battery unit. As the electrical machine is connected to 
the rear axle, braking deceleration of up to 1.6 m/s 2 occurs here. These drag torques would bring about 
unstable driving conditions if the drive wheels were to block on a smooth road surface and therefore 
not be able to absorb further cornering forces. The engine drag torque control MSR therefore 
continuously monitors the wheel speeds at the rear axle for slip and intervenes if necessary. To do 
so, a data log is sent from the DSC control unit to the Electrical Digital Motor Electronics (EDME). As 
a consequence, the maximum braking deceleration of 1.6 m/s 2 is reduced if necessary to 0 m/s 2 in 
accordance with the current slip values. If unstable driving conditions still occur, the DSC also ensures, 
by brake interventions at individual wheels, a drivability that is easily controlled.

6. Driving Stability Control 

The engine drag torque control MSR cannot be deactivated. The driver therefore cannot rely on the 
stability of the vehicle during braking deceleration by the electrical machine, also in wintery road 
conditions. 

Dry by applying brake 

With the wiper switched on and at a defined driving speed a low hydraulic brake pressure is built up 
cyclically via the DSC unit. This overcomes the air gap between the brake pad and brake disc and 
water and dirt is removed from the surface of the brake disc. The frequency and the brake pressure 
applied depends on the driving speed and wiper interval. The advantage of this control is a faster more 
even response of the brake. 

Drive-off assistant 

The system supports the driver when driving off on hills. In this situation, the pressure in the service 
brake system is maintained for 1.5 s after the footbrake has been released. This minimizes the 
amount by which the vehicle rolls back. If the vehicle is heavily laden, it may roll back slightly. The 
brake pressure in the service brake system is released after 1.5 s and the vehicle starts rolling back. 
The drive-off assistant is a DSC subfunction which is always available and must not be activated 
separately by the driver. The longitudinal acceleration sensor system detects gradients and the wheel 
speed sensors detect when the vehicle is at a standstill. The pressure in the two brake circuits can 
be maintained with the assistance of the pressure-retaining solenoid valves in the DSC hydraulic 
unit. This benefits the driver as the vehicle can be driven off safely in a manner which is gentle on the 
electric motor, also on steep gradients. 

Fading Brake Support 

When braking for extended periods on steep downhill gradients the braking effect may reduce due to 
a sharp rise in heating of the brake, referred to as brake fade. For the brake pedal feel to be the same 
for the driver in every operating condition, brake fade is automatically compensated for by the Fading 
Brake Support. In doing so, the DSC control unit takes the brake pressure from the brake pressure 
sensor applied in the DSC hydraulic unit and the slip values determined by the wheel speed sensors 
into account. The information from the DSC brake pressure sensor serves to determine the driver's 
braking request received. If the driver's braking request deviates from the slip curves determined by 
more than a predefined limit value, this is corrected by a pressure build-up via the pump in the DSC 
unit. 

Dynamic emergency braking 

If the parking brake button is operated during the journey above a defined driving speed, the DSC 
unit initiates a dynamic emergency braking operation. The activation of the 2-piston pump and 
changeover valves in the DSC unit causes a pressure build-up at all four wheel brakes. The slip limits 
of all wheels are monitored with the assistance of the four wheel speed sensors to ensure a stable 
braking operation until the vehicle comes to a standstill. The two actuators of the electromechanical 
parking brake are activated as soon as the vehicle comes to a standstill. Now only the parking brake 
secures the vehicle to prevent it from rolling away. 

If the pump in the DSC unit cannot build up any pressure, the vehicle is decelerated via the parking 
brake actuators. In this case, the control current of the parking brake actuators is controlled with 
reference to the slip curves of the rear axle wheels. This ensures that the wheels on the rear axle do 
not block and therefore give rise to an unstable driving condition.

DSC indicator and warning light 


The Dynamic Traction Control cannot be activated or deactivated in the same way as before via a 
button, and must instead be selected at the Central Information Display (1) via the controller (4). 
Activation of the DTC (3) is confirmed with a check mark. As soon as the DTC is activated, the 
slip limits of the wheels are shifted upwards at driving speeds below 50 km/h. The DTC therefore 
increases the traction on loose surfaces, as the drive wheels are braked very late via the DSC unit. 
However, this reduces the driving stability. The driver is warning about this by the DSC indicator and 
warning light (6) in the instrument cluster (KOMBI) (5). The slip limits are automatically reset to the 
normal value above a driving speed of 50 km/h. If the driving speed subsequently drops below 
50 km/h, the increased slip limits and resulting circumstances are active once again. Following a 
terminal change, the DTC is always in the deactivated state.

Hydraulic brake-servo assistance 

If the vacuum system develops a fault (e.g. malfunction of electrical vacuum pump), a DSC function 
is activated which assists with the implementation of a hydraulic (instead of vacuum-based) brake- 
servo assistance. This DSC function is activated automatically if the DSC control unit detects a fault 
of this kind based on the brake vacuum signal. The DSC control unit also arranges for a Check Control 
message to be displayed at the instrument cluster (KOMBI) to inform the driver about the fault status. 



101 Brake Check Control message 

If this fault occurs, the brake pedal travel and brake pedal force are not the same as they would be in 
the normal condition. However, the customer can still decelerate the vehicle safely using the brake 
power assistance, and also use the Dynamic Stability Control if required for stabilizing interventions. 

Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) 

Dynamic Cruise Control DCC is a cruise control with brake intervention. The DCC maintains a selected 
speed and features the following additional functions: 

• Adapted coasting mode: 

The set speed is maintained during controlled downhill driving by increasing the regeneration 
torque by the electrical machine. This relieves the load on the wheel brakes and increases the 
range. 

• Active brake intervention: 

If the engine drag torque is insufficient in coasting (overrun) mode to maintain the chosen 
speed, the vehicle is decelerated automatically by means of additional controlled brake 
intervention. 

• Curve Speed Limiter: 

Depending on the actual lateral acceleration, the driving speed is reduced during controlled 
cornering as necessary. When coming out of the bend the speed is adjusted until it once again 
reaches the desired level. 

• Overload protection function: 

The maximum speed of the 101 is 150 km/h. If the maximum speed is exceeded due to the 
downhill force during downhill driving, the 101 is decelerated to 150 km/h via the regeneration 
torque of the electrical machine. If the electrical machine cannot recover energy, the 101 is 
decelerated to 150 km/h via the wheel brakes. 

For more information on the Cruise control with braking function DCC, refer to the "101 Driver Assist 
Systems" training information.
