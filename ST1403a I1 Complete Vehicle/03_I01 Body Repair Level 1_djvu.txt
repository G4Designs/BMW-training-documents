2.1. Overview 

This chapter shows examples of operations involved in the disassembly and installation at the outer 
panels of the i3. Furthermore, adjusting procedures are described in detail using the current repair 
instructions in the BMW workshop information system. 

The outer panels of the i3 is made almost entirely of thermoplastic plastics (material designation: PP 
+EPDM). The plastic outer panels components are designed to ensure the gap dimensions are up to 
BMW standards, even when subjected to strong temperature fluctuations. The plastic outer panels 
components cannot corrode and are considerably lighter than steel. The outer panels are clipped or 
screwed to the i3 body by additional fixing rails made of plastic or retaining elements.

The concept of the outer panels is pursued further in the A-pillar trim panel and roof frame trim panel. 
The A-pillar trim panel and roof frame trim panel are therefore implemented by bonding several 
components at the production stage so that they can be attached to the body by retaining tabs. The 
retaining tabs in this case engage with fixing rails which are glued to the side frame of the Life module. 
The A-pillar trim panel is also screwed at the bottom edge in combination with a rivet nut in the carbon 
structure.

Different materials have been used with the tailgate of the i3 in order to satisfy all requirements, e.g. 
torsional rigidity combined with lightweight construction. These requirements are achieved by using 
thermoplastics, glass and die-cast aluminium. 


The tailgate can be opened from the inside by removing the interior trim. This is required if the closing 
mechanism or electronics malfunction. 

Buffers that determine the distance between the tailgate and body when closed are attached to the 
tailgate.

The main difference in the operating principle is that the glass lid moves outside the vehicle. During 
the first step, the glass lid is raised/vented at the rear when opening. The slide rail which is centred on 
the glass lid is then moved backwards. Guide rails are also mounted on the left and right of the glass lid 
to provide additional stabilization. 



The glass lid cannot be fully opened. In this case the slide rail of the mechanism defines the end 
position of the tilt/slide sunroof opening.

The position of the glass lid is determined by the screw connections in the horizontal and vertical 
direction. The precise fit of the glass lid on the gaskets and the exact position in relation to the outer 
panels must be checked according to the repair instructions following all installation and adjusting 
procedures. The integrated mechanism carrier is screwed into the structurally rigid frame gasket 
support. The precise position in this case is determined by centring elements then screwed. The 
screwed guide rails can guarantee by means of tolerance compensation at the screw holes that the 
moving components will run without jamming. 

The glass lid is screwed centrally and at the side. The screw connections can be accessed from the 
passenger compartment by the roller sunblind openings. Once the glass lid has been disassembled, 
all remaining screw connections of the slide/tilt sunroof components such as those on the mechanism 
support can be accessed to carry out the installation work.

3.4. Windshield 

To guarantee a precise fit of the windshield, centering pins which are positioned on the outer sides of 
the A-pillars in the area of the roofliner are attached to the windshield. On the left side of the vehicle, 
centering is carried out with a fixed point while on the right side of the vehicle tolerance compensation 
is provided at the centring pins in the horizontal direction in the form of an elongated hole.

The bonded connection between the windshield and body components can be separated using a 
special tool. The centering pins are also cut through during this process. The new windshield is then 
reglued and positioned by the centering pins. In doing so, particular attention must be paid to the 
different materials to which the windscreen is attached. In the lower section, the windscreen is glued 
to the steel cowl panel. At the sides, the window glass is glued to plastic strips that are permanently 
connected to the body structure. The top mounting is at the carbon roof outer panels in vehicles 
without slide/tilt sunroof, or at the plastic rigid frame of the slide/tilt sunroof in vehicles

4.1. Reconditioning of outer panels 



Before carrying out any repair work on the outer panels, the retaining elements on the carbon structure 
components must be inspected. The inspection should also extend to looking for scratches in the 
surface of components made of carbon. 

For this, please observe the currently valid procedure set out in the repair instructions. 


Damage such as small cracks and holes in plastic parts of the outer panels, i.e. all components that 
have not been manufactured from carbon, can be repaired using the repair methods "plastic gluing" 
and "plastic welding". Please bear in mind that the carbon roof cannot be repaired using these 
methods. 

Plastics can be divided into three groups: 

♦ Thermoplastics 

♦ Thermosetting plastics 

♦ Elastomers. 

As the outer panels components of the i3 are made of thermoplastic plastics, only these plastics are 
taken into consideration. The following table provides an overview of the various thermoplastics.

4.1.1. Plastic bonding 

With the plastic bonding repair method, identification of the plastic grade is not required. With this 
method, galvanized reinforcement strips and a fleece are glued to the reverse face of the component. 
Following hardening, the repair area on the front face of the component is filled with glue. Once the 
hardening time is once again complete the surface can be ground to match the original form of the 
component. 

The repair kit comprises the following: 

♦ Two-component adhesive 

♦ Plastic primer 

♦ Cleaning agent and thinner 

♦ Cartridge gun 

♦ Reinforcement fleece 

♦ Reinforcement strip.

4.1.2. Plastic welding 

With the plastic welding repair method, smaller cracks on plastic components (thermoplastics) made 
of PP+EPDM and ABS for example can be repaired. A plastic repair kit with soldering iron and welding 
adapter is used in the BMW workshop environment. A specific welding wire is used for this, depending 
on the material composition of the component. 



Not all types of plastic can be welded. Also observe the current notes in the repair instructions. 


The repair kit comprises the following: 

♦ Soldering iron with welding adapter 

♦ Welding wire PP 

♦ Welding wire ABS 

♦ Universal welding wire

The advantage when compared to the plastic gluing repair method is that an adhesive hardening time 
is not required and fewer operations are necessary. 


The distinguishing characteristic of thermoplastics is that they, similar to metals, can be re-fused and 
their geometry modified. 


Examples of thermoplastics are: 


4.2. Repair of fixing rails 

For economic reasons, the fixing rails of the i3 are not repaired. If damaged, the fixing rails, and 
possibly their mountings, are replaced. 



Refer to the repair instructions for the prescribed tightening torques to avoid damaging the retaining 
elements and structural components made of carbon. 


When the fixing rails are replaced, the components of the carbon structure must be inspected for 
damage. The inspection should also extend to looking for scratches in the surface of components 
made of carbon. 


4.3. Repairing door window frames 

When repairing the door outer panels or parts in the area surrounding the door window frame, the door 
window frame must be inspected for damage. For this, please observe the currently valid procedure 
set out in the repair instructions. 

The holders of the outer panels at the door window frame may be reshaped if slightly deformed, 
providing the weld seam is still fully intact.

4.4. Repair of screwed deformation elements 

If damaged, the screwed deformation elements at the Drive module must not be repaired. 



Please observe the current notes in the repair instructions regarding the repair of aluminium 
components. 


4.5. Repair of ground support points 



The tightening torques listed in the repair instructions must be adhered to during all installation work, 
otherwise the resulting damage can be extremely costly. 


If ground support points at the Drive module are damaged these can be repaired. For this, please 
observe the current repair procedure in the repair instructions.

5.1. Notes 

As new materials and new fastening concepts are being used, this results in new repair methods. The 
following notes must be observed. Special care must be taken when carrying out work at the vehicle 
due to the use of high-voltage components in the i3. 

To ensure that the i3 is repaired professionally and safely, special procedures and methods have been 
developed. 

Please also find out about the repair work that your facility is permitted to carry out. The Service 
formats referred to at the outset must be observed without compromise. 



Danger to life! 

When carrying out work, observe the detailed procedure and sequence specified in the repair 
instructions that are valid at the time of repair. 



Danger to life! 

Before repair work on a vehicle that has been involved in an accident can be carried out, it must be 
ensured by appropriately qualified personnel that the vehicle is intrinsically safe. 



When assessing damage at a i3, the current procedure in the repair instructions must be observed. 

This procedure is markedly different to the procedure followed up till now. Please familiarizeyourself 
with the relevant contents beforehand. 


Based on current information, the following elements are subject to a special inspection following 
damage which must be observed without fail: 

• Carbon body components (Life module) 

• Surfaces of body components made of carbon 

• Retaining elements at body components made of carbon (e.g. rivet nuts, holders for mounting 
the outer panels, attachment points of hinges) 

• Structural components made of aluminium (Drive module).
