101 Information and Communication 

1. Introduction 


The information and communication system is becoming more and more important in automotive 
manufacture. Therefore, in the 101, some of the already existing BMW systems are used. 

The 101 also boasts intelligent ConnectedDrive functions with which the customer can easily and 
comfortably arrive at his destination. The 101 is equipped with the BMW navigation system, which is 
tailored to the specific requirements of electric mobility. For example, the navigation system of the 101 
provides information on the most efficient and environment friendly route for a maximum range and 
shows the driver all the available charging stations en route. 

With help of the BMW i Remote app the driver can plan his route before the journey and check the 
maximum range regularly. He can also control all aspects of the charging process at any time. 

BMW i looks beyond the vehicle itself for the urban mobility experience. The new mobility services 
such as DriveNow is one such example. By means of intermodal route guidance public transport offers 
can be included in the mobility planning. The connection between the outside world and the vehicle 
makes driving in mega cities simpler, more pleasant and more efficient. 

This training material is intended to provide an overview of the information and communication 
systems used. 

The 101 is available with 2 navigation headunit options. The “Entry NAV” or SA606 Business 
Navigation system is the standard equipment. It offers the new Basic Headunit, a 6.5” screen and 
most of the basic navigation features which are essential for the functions of the i3. And the optional 
equipment SA609 Navigation Professional with the HU-H headunit which offers a 10.25” screen and 
adds a split screen, media hard drive, 3D maps, etc.

Due to the EMF related with high voltage components AM radio band is not available in the 

101 . 


The hardware structure of the Entry Navigation Basic Headunit is similar to Headunit High. Therefore 
the hardware contains the necessary components for the navigation system. With the exception of 
the yaw rate sensor, which in the 101 is housed in the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) and is transferred 
to the headunit via a bus signal. A non removable flash memory with 32 GB is installed for the Entry 
navigation system for permanent storage of the map data. 

As with Headunit High the Basic Headunit does not have a CD/DVD drive. A map update can be 
performed by the customer via the USB audio interface or by Service via the BMW i programming 
station. 

SA606 Business navigation system offers a 6.5” CID screen instead of the 10.25” of the HU-H system, 
it is also connected to the headunit via an APIX line. 

Vehicles with the Navigation Business system (SA606) are equipped as standard with a 7-button 
iDrive controller. The Touch controller is only available with the optional Navigation Professional 
(SA609).

In contrast to the Navigation Professional (SA609) user interface the Business Navigation system 
(SA606) only provides the most basic features. 

The main menu is divided into eight selection menus: 


• Multimedia 

• Radio 

• Telephone 

• Navigation 

• Office

2.2. Headunit High 

The Headunit High (known from other BMW models) is also available in the 101. 

The telephone and multimedia functions are integrated in the Headunit High. A Combox is therefore 
also not required in the 101. The Telematic Communication Box (TCB) control unit is installed for 
telematics functions. 

Additional information on the Headunit High can be found in the "ST 1211 Headunit High" training 
material issued in March 2012 and available in ICR 

A_ 

The 101 offers the Basic Headunit as standard equipment with SA606 Navigation Business 
and in the Headunit High with Navigation Professional (option 609) as optional equipment. 


The Headunit High in the 101 does not have a DVD drive and could therefore be installed under the 
seat bench. The Headunit High is connected at the K-CAN4 and at the Body Domain Controller via 
Ethernet.

While the memory capacity remained the same for contact details and music collection, massive 
extensions were made to other areas. For example the memory capacity for navigation was increased 
by more than 40 GB to 106 GB. The integrated owner’s manual (IBA) was increased from 4 GB to 
6.1 GB and the Gracenote database from 5.1 GB to 10.2 GB. 

The following graphic shows how the memory capacity is divided for the individual areas.

To protect sensitive customer data such as "Address details" and "Settings" for example, a 
permanently integrated flash memory was housed in the Headunit High. The data here is protected 
much better than on a hard disk against external influences. The integrated flash memory is 
permanently installed and cannot be replaced separately. 

Displays and operating elements 

The central information display CID has no separate bus connection in conjunction with the Headunit 
High. The CID is directly connected to the headunit via an APIX data line.

Power supply for CID via Headunit High 


APIX (Automotive Pixel Link) is a bit-serial data transfer system with a data transfer rate of 1 Gbit/s 
on just one copper core pair. Each APIX data channel also has a bidirectional reverse channel. This 
reverse channel is used for transmitting status information (e.g. operating temperature of the CID), 
diagnosis information and control signals. Data transfer via the APIX data line has been optimized 
with regard to electromagnetic compatibility and power consumption. Because of the CID's low 
power consumption, the CID can be supplied with power via two separate current lines directly by 
the Headunit High, and there is no need for a separate power supply to the CID. The two copper core 
pairs and the two power supply leads are connected by a common connector to the headunit and the 
CID. Because of the high data transfer rate with low electromagnetic emissions, it is also possible to 
use copper wiring for applications with a high bandwidth requirement and to dispense with fiber optic 
networking.

2.4. Telephone systems 

In the 101 two telephone systems are used in conjunction with the Headunit High. 

• Basic version of telephone with hands-free system and USB interface (included in the 
standard equipment). 

• Enhanced USB and Bluetooth plus Smartphone Integration (Comfort telephone option 6NS) 

The telephone functions in the 101 are implemented for the basic telephone version with hands¬ 
free system and USB interface and for the optional equipment Enhanced USB and Bluetooth plus 
Smartphone Integration (Comfort telephone option 6NS) in the headunit. 

In the basic version with hands-free system and USB interface the basic telephone functions of 
the Headunit High are provided with a reduced range of functions. For the first time with the basic 
telephone system the album covers, if embedded in the music tracks, are now shown on the central 
information display (CID). Extended functions of cell phone preparation with connection to Bluetooth 
devices (e.g. Bluetooth audio, Office, etc.) are not provided. The basic telephone system includes a 
hands-free system without cell phone charger (base plate) and without a vehicle external antenna. 

The "Enhanced USB and Bluetooth plus Smartphone Integration” (Comfort telephone option 6NS) 
package includes: 

• A hands-free system, with which the Bluetooth-compatible cell phones communicate 
wirelessly with the vehicle. 

• A base plate, for which suitable snap-in adapters are offered for recommended cell phones 
and sold separately.. The cell phone is charged via the snap-in adapter and offers a connection 
to the vehicle’s outside (roof) antenna for better reception. The base plate also includes a USB 
connection, which enables the audio playback from the smartphone via the headunit. 

• A USB audio interface facilitates the connection of an enabled MP3 player, Apple® iPod® or 
USB stick. The audio files or video files can be streamed from the USB stick to the Headunit 
High (HU-H). Then the headunit of the vehicle can play the audio files (also audio books, 
podcasts) and video files and display these files on the central information display (CID). 

Details on the possible playback information can be found in the "ST 1211 Headunit High" 
training material issued in March 2012 and found on ICR 

• Operation via specific operating elements (iDrive controller, favorite button, multifunction for 
steering wheel or voice processing system) of the vehicle. 

• The Office function with the screen mask of organizer content from the cell phone in the form 
of emails, SMS text messages and a calender, which are shown on the central information 
display under the menu item "Office". The screen mask of contact photos from the address 
book of the cell phone is also shown on the CID. Data from the address book of the connected 
telephone and address data which was saved permanently in the vehicle are shown at the 
same time. 

• Audio streaming per Bluetooth from cell phone. 

• Playing of music tracks of the cell phone from the base plate with simultaneous display of 
album covers if music track is embedded. 

• Driver update for multimedia and telephone system via USB interface (customer-initiated 
software update, also called KISA/KISU is not yet available in the US market).

2. System Components 

2.5. Telematic Communication Box 

The Telematic Communication Box (TCB) is a permanently installed speech and data modem for the 
Headunit High. As there is automatic activation upon series launch, the 101 already has a Telematic 
Communication Box (TCB) in the basic equipment. 



Telematic Communication Box (TCB) 


The transmission standard of the Telematic Communication Box (TCB) is specified in the HSPA 
standard with 14.4 mbit/s. HSPA "High Speed Packet Access" is an extension of the mobile radio 
standard UMTS, which enables higher data transfer rates. 

As most interfaces and functions of Combox Media are moved to the Headunit High (hands-free 
mode, USB interfaces, speech processing, Bluetooth audio, Office, contacts, etc.), the Telematic 
Communication Box is required for the following functions: 

• BMW Assist with eCall (emergency-call function) 

• BMW Online 

• BMW Internet using a SIM card integrated in the vehicle (P-SIM) 

• Remote functions (reception and controller) 

• "Text-to-speech" function in Office area 

• BMW TeleServices via P-SIM 

• Transmission of last vehicle position (GPS tracking) 

• Transmission of vehicle data 

The transmission of the vehicle position (GPS tracking) and the vehicle data to the BMW back-end is 
carried out by the Telematic Communication Box (TCB). In addition to the last vehicle position, vehicle 
condition data, for example the state of charge of the high-voltage battery, is also transmitted. This is 
required for apps, amongst other things. 

The customer has the option of integrating "GPS tracking" in the Settings menu using a controller. 
When "GPS tracking" is deactivated the data cannot be updated and the Remote Services are only 
available to a limited extent.

The emergency-call function involves sending the data package, as well as setting up a voice contact 
from the vehicle to the emergency call center. The TCB is equipped with an additional battery, whose 
function is guaranteed independent of the vehicle electrical system. Thus even in the event of an 
accident with an interruption to the voltage supply (destruction of battery, power distribution box or 
wiring) an automatic emergency call can still be placed.

2.7. Speaker systems 

Overview 

The speaker systems in the 101 are available in two specification levels: 

• Stereo system (standard) 

• Harman Kardon® HiFi Premium sound system (option 674). 

The following table gives an overview of the possible speaker systems in the 101. 


Stereo system 

Harman Kardon® HiFi Premium sound 
system 

Activation by headunit (4 x 25 W) 

4 speakers 

7-channel AMPH (360 W) 

12 speakers 


In the 101 no central bass concept is used. 

The speakers were optimized in terms of weight in both versions. The weight saving in comparison to 
a speaker system in the F22 is about 1150 g. This was achieved not only through the reduction of the 
speakers, but also by a weight reduction of the individual speaker components. For example, for the 
Harman Kardon® HiFi Premium sound system (option 674) neodymium is used as a light magnetic 
material. 


2.7.1. Stereo system 

The stereo system gets by without additional amplifiers and uses the headunit's speaker outputs. 

In the 101 a total of four speakers are used in the stereo system. These are activated via four channels 
from the headunit. 

The graphic below shows the speakers of the stereo system. All speakers are operated by the integral 
amplifier in the headunit at a power rating of 4 x 25 watts.

2.7.2. HiFi system 

The Harman Kardon® HiFi Premium sound system (option 674) consists of twelve speakers. Separate 
speakers are installed in the Harman Kardon® HiFi Premium sound system for the tweeter and mid¬ 
tone ranges. 

A seven-channel amplifier with digital equalizing is integrated in the Harman Kardon® HiFi Premium 
sound system. 



Amplifier of Harman Kardon® (option 674) HiFi Premium sound system 


The audio amplifier (AMP) of the Harman Kardon® HiFi Premium sound system is a bus user in the K- 
CAN4. 

The mid-range speakers and tweeters of the Harman Kardon® HiFi Premium sound system have 
high-quality diaphragms for a clearly differentiated sound pattern. The tweeters have aluminium 
membranes and the mid-range speakers are ALumaprene speakers®. 

The diaphragms and magnetic systems in ALumaprene speakers® are differentiated by their larger 
dynamics and increased efficiency in comparison to conventional speakers. ALumaprene speakers® 
are therefore a further key step in the direction of energy-saving speakers, which do not compromise 
on the performance. In addition, ALumaprene speakers® also boast the same excellent properties 
of speakers made from woven aramide fiber diaphragms, but are made from a specially developed 
polymer of the latest generation. The particularly light modules have excellent damping properties, 
which limit resonances to a minimum. This enables a particularly well-controlled frequency response, 
which can only be achieved with high-end sound transducers.

Main menu of the navigation system 


A dynamic range display is the core of this navigation. It takes into consideration all relevant factors 
such as state of charge of the high-voltage battery, driving style, topographical preconditions and 
even the current traffic situation. A nearby charging station is displayed upon the driver's request. 

The system also informs the driver about how much charging time is required in order to be able to 
complete the return journey or the journey to another destination. 

In the 101 the driver is able to access the so-called "Intermodal route". "Intermodal route guidance" 
is understood to support individual mobility by networking existing traffic systems. An integrative 
connection and the synergetic use of different means of transportation is effected for this purpose. So 
that the driver of a BMW 101 reaches his destination quickly and relaxed, the use of the vehicle with 
the transport modes of the public transport utilities is intelligently linked taking into consideration the 
parking situation. 

The operating concept of the navigation menu known from other BMW models was retained and 
adapted to the 101 through functional enhancement. 

There is an overview of the adapted menu below. 

3.2.1. Destination input 

The addresses of the last 30 charging stations used, for example at home, are automatically stored. 
The charging stations can be called up and used as a destination in the route guidance. 

Call up last charging station: 

1 "Navigation" 

2 "Last charging stations". 

Start route guidance: 

1 "Navigation" 

2 "Last charging stations"

3.2.2. Route guidance 

Intermodal route 

The route planning, which was developed especially for BMW i and the requirements in urban 
districts, also integrates the public transport offer. In selected towns and cities the public transport is 
considered when the route guidance is activated and can be included in the route planning. 

The route to the parking lot at the next suitable transfer option for public transport is calculated. 

The driver has the option in his vehicle to select an intermodal route. He is guided to a car park or 
multi-story car parking lot. After leaving the vehicle he is guided to the correct public transport station, 
for example tram line, with help of the BMW i Remote app, and also on the last stage by foot to his 
destination. Using the BMW ConnectedDrive server the destination address previously input in the 
navigation system of the vehicle is automatically transmitted to the smartphone of i3 driver. 

The driving details for the onward journey are also displayed with the public transport.

3.2.3. Range Assistant 

The Range Assistant as part of the navigation system has the following functions: 

• Display of charging stations 

• Range map and return journey options. 

The Range Assistant dynamic range map also considers the current traffic situation and the present 
route profile, in addition to the state of charge of the high-voltage battery, the driving style and the 
selected driving mode. If a destination entered is outside the calculated range, the system gives the 
driver tips for a more efficient driving style. 

If a return to a preferred charging station is not possible, the Range Assistant enables a selection of 
the most efficient route (ECO PRO route). The Range Assistant also suggests alternative charging 
stations in the surrounding area. The driver can also increase the range by selecting ECO PRO+ mode 
with the driving experience switch.

The Range Assistant checks whether a destination entered can be reached using the current state of 
charge of the high-voltage battery. If the range is insufficient, different recommendations to increase 
the range are automatically displayed. 


The list of recommendations can be found below: 

"ECO PRO route" 

A consumption-optimized variant of the route 
is calculated and stored in the route guidance. 

The new route is displayed in the map view and 
the route guidance is continued. 

Switch from "ECO PRO mode" to "ECO PRO+ 
mode" 

The range can be increased by switching to 

ECO PRO+ mode. 

"Search for charging stations" 

A search for charging stations along the route 
is performed and can be stored in the route 
guidance as a destination or stage finish. 


ECO PRO route 

The customer receives support during the selection of an optimized route taking into consideration 
the energy management. The combination of a specific electric vehicle navigation "ECO PRO route" 
as an integral element of the navigation system and the powertrain driving mode "ECO PRO" and 
"ECO PRO+" is the perfect symbiosis of ConnectedDrive and a purely electric motor. 

For instance, the Range Assistant dynamic range map also considers the current traffic situation and 
the present route profile, in addition to the state of charge of the high-voltage battery, the driving style 
and the selected driving mode. If a destination entered is outside the calculated range, the system 
gives the driver tips for a more efficient driving style. 

ECO PRO mode 


45 





















101 Information and Communication 

3. Functions 


ECO PRO mode adapts the accelerator characteristic curve, with the same pressure applied to the 
pedal less power is used. The heating and air-conditioning system also works in a more energy¬ 
saving manner. The restriction of the maximum speed can be adjusted between 80 km/h (50 mph) and 
130 km/h (80 mph) using the iDrive. 

ECO PRO+ mode 

ECO PRO+ mode is aligned to a maximum range. The energy consumption and the range of the 
vehicle can be actively influenced by the driver by changing the driving mode. By using the driving 
experience switch the driver has the option to also increase the range by switching from ECO PRO to 
ECO PRO+ mode. 

The maximum speed is restricted to 90 km/h (55 mph). The power of electrical consumers such as 
seat heating and mirror heating are reduced and partially deactivated, the heating and air-conditioning 
system is shut down to a minimum.

3.3. Updating navigation data 

The navigation data is updated using a USB stick. The reason here being that the DVD drive is no 
longer used in the 101. Another reason is that some road maps have to be spread out over several 
DVDs due to their size (e.g. a map of Europe requires three DVDs). A USB stick with corresponding 
capacity is practical here. 

The navigation data (map data) in the vehicle can also be updated via the BMW programming system.

3.4. BMW ConnectedDrive 

In addition to the navigation system, the BMW i ConnectedDrive Services are fully customized to the 
specific requirements of electric mobility. 



In addition to the state of charge of the high-voltage battery, the activities of electrical convenience 
functions, the driving style and the selected driving mode, topographical specifications, as well 
as the current traffic situation, are also included in the calculation. The system can calculate an 
upcoming uphill drive, as well as stop-and-go traffic or a traffic jam, as energy-intensive, thereby 
reducing the range. Current and detailed real time traffic data (Real Time Traffic Information) is also 
used. The analysis and evaluation of the information is done centrally on the BMW ConnectedDrive 
server which is permanently connected to the vehicle. The connection between the vehicle and the 
BMW ConnectedDrive server is guaranteed by a permanent SIM card installed in the vehicle. The 
permanently installed SIM card is located in the Telematic Communication Box (TCB) and guarantees 
a connection beyond the entire service life of the vehicle. 

Via a smartphone the customer has the option of establishing a connection to his vehicle and having 
important information for his planned route displayed, for example the state of charge of the high- 
voltage battery. 

3.4.1. BMW i Remote App 

The BMW i Remote app is a further development of the My BMW Remote app, which was tailored 
especially for the specific requirements of electric mobility. 

The app can be downloaded from iTunes or Google Play. 


50 






101 Information and Communication 

3. Functions 


While the remote functions have been realized to date using the headunit, in the 101 these are 
implemented via the Telematic Communication Box (TCB). The response time of the BMW i Remote 
app was therefore able to be minimized. 

The remote functions accessible via a smartphone enable a vehicle to be found, show nearby charging 
stations, permit the charging of the high-voltage battery and activation of convenience functions at the 
touch of a button and provide information on current vehicle data, e.g. the state of charge of the high- 
voltage battery. 

If the BMW i3 is connected to a charging station, the charging procedure is started or ended remotely, 
or even controlled using a timer. 

Using the BMW i Remote app a destination and a free charging station can be selected and then 
transmitted to the vehicle. 

With help of the intelligent BMW i Remote app the driver can plan his route before the journey and 
check the maximum range regularly. The driver can select a destination using his smartphone and then 
transmit this to the vehicle. 

If the customer leaves his vehicle at the destination, he also has the option of being navigated to 
his final destination via a pedestrian navigation function integrated in the BMW i Remote app. The 
destination, which the driver has selected beforehand in the vehicle, is automatically transmitted to the 
BMW i Remote app via the BMW ConnectedDrive server. 



BMW i Remote App. Example: Activation of the charging procedure 

The BMW i Remote app can be used in conjunction with a device (e.g. smartphone), which has a IOS 
or an Android operating system. 


The BMW i Remote app comprises three main menu items: 

• Status

have a 50 percent share in the joint venture. The BMW Group supplies the jointly owned company 
with the vehicles and the vehicle technology. Sixt AG provides premium services, leasing know-how, 

IT systems, as well as a comprehensive station network for the registration of customers. DriveNow 
offers a modern mobility concept in Munich, Berlin, Dusseldorf, Cologne and San Francisco. An 
important feature of DriveNow in Germany is the rental and return of the vehicles at any station. 

DriveNow only uses high-quality premium vehicles from the MINI and BMW brands. All vehicles have 
at least four seats, all convenience functions (e.g. Park Distance Control, automatic air conditioning, 
seat heating, etc.) and extremely efficient engines. The vehicles are marked with the DriveNow logo 
and are easily recognizable. Other models can also be flexibly included in the car-sharing fleet at a later 
date depending on demand. 

With the integration of the ActiveE vehicles, one was able to obtain valuable findings in the area of 
electric mobility and in e-Car Sharing. This is a further step towards developing sustainable BMW i 
mobility solutions for congested urban areas, in which sufficient charging infrastructure is available." 


4.2. System description 

Access authorization 

The customer must register beforehand with the fleet operating company so he can use the Car 
Sharing vehicles. He receives an "authentication device" which he can use in the future to open 
and start the vehicles. The authentication device is issued in the form of a label or a card. In order to 
ensure the legal requirement for a driving licence check by the fleet operating company is satisfied, 
the authentication device is currently adhered to the driving licence. In later expansion stages 
the authorization can be transmitted to an authentication device which the customer takes to the 
company, e.g. a smartphone. 

Finding and booking a vehicle 

With "Private Car Sharing" there are currently three ways to find and book a vehicle: 

• Telephone call to the operating company hot-line 

• On the Internet, e.g. from a home PC 

• Smartphone app, which locates the vehicles online. 

This way the customer has the option of reserving a vehicle which is located at a convenient location. 
This vehicle is then "blocked" for the next 15 minutes. After arriving at the vehicle the customer can 
open the vehicle and confirm the booking. The booking is made very conveniently via a smartphone, 
the customer is guided to the vehicle. 

With "Private Car Sharing" there is also the extra option of spontaneously booking directly at the 
vehicle. 

The customer can book and use a vehicle he sees spontaneously at the car park. A prerequisite is 
that the vehicle has not already been reserved by someone else. A vehicle which has already been 
reserved can be identified using the status display located at the windshield. Only if the status display 
illuminates in green, can the vehicle be booked spontaneously by the customer.

The status display is located behind the windshield at the bottom left, is visible from the outside and 
integrated in the outer reader: 


LED illuminates green: 

Vehicle is available 

LED illuminates yellow: 

Vehicle is reserved 

LED illuminates red: 

Vehicle is in use by a customer and was parked 
"for a short time" (locking system must be 
locked) 



Outer reader with status display for Car Sharing 


With "Private Car Sharing" the booking period is not defined at the start. It only ends when the 
customer no longer requires the vehicle and terminates the booking. The customer does not have to 
provide any details on the planned booking period at the start. 

The following differences arise for "Corporate Car Sharing": 

• Spontaneous booking is currently not planned 

• The customer can reserve a vehicle in advance. He can specify the location at which he would 
like to pick up the vehicle, the vehicle type or a specific vehicle 

• The customer must specify the planned usage period at the time of booking. 

Opening the vehicle 

The customer can open the vehicle by holding his authentication device, in Germany his driver's 
licence with the adhered NFC transponder, in the scan area of the vehicle's outer reader. If the 
customer is authorised to use the vehicle the central locking system of the vehicle opens. 

The delivery and return of a vehicle are only possible at locations with radio link. It is also possible to 
close and open the vehicle in the event of an interruption to a journey, i.e. parking without return, at 
locations without GSM reception. 


Booking a vehicle 

After the customer enters the vehicle, he receives a personal welcome on the central information 
display (CID). 


57 






101 Information and Communication 

4. Car Sharing 

Before using the vehicle a booking or reservation must be effected: 

PIN input: 

• The customer must correctly enter his personal PIN code. 

Query on cleanliness: 

• The customer is asked about the cleanliness of the vehicle. 

Confirmation of damage: 

• Damage already reported is displayed to the customer. Then the customer can report new 
damage via the hot-line or confirm that no other damage is present. 

Confirming a booking: 

• The customer confirms the rental conditions. 

If the customer has successfully completed the booking, he can use the vehicle. 

Using a vehicle 

In order to establish driving readiness, the customer receives a note on the central information display 
(CID) that he must set down his authentication device on the Car Sharing module and press the 
accelerator. 



Car Sharing Module 


After the driving readiness of the vehicle has been switched off, a specific Car Sharing menu is shown 
on the central information display (CID). The following options are now available to the driver: 


58 


Steady driving 
Parking 

Terminate booking. 







101 Information and Communication 

4. Car Sharing 

Steady driving 

With the selection "Driving" the customer receives a note that the vehicle can be set to driving 
readiness via the START-STOP button. This is the standard selection and does not have to be 
selected explicitly. Generally the customer can re-establish the driving readiness by pressing the 
START-STOP button independent of the menu selection and continue to drive. A prerequisite for 
enabling the driving readiness is the storage of the authentication device at the Car Sharing module. 

Parking 

Park vehicle means interrupting the journey without returning the vehicle. The booking is still active 
and the status display in the outer reader displays this with a red LED. 

Terminate booking 

With Private Car Sharing this can be done at all public car parks, sometimes at residential parking 
spaces and in multi-storey car parks of cooperation venture partners within the business area. 

There are no additional costs for the parking fees for the customer at selected public car parks and 
multi-storey car parks as these are included in the per minute charge. 

The customer cannot return the vehicle outside the business area and in non-approved residential 
parking spaces, as well as in car parks which are subject to a fee for Car Sharing. This means the 
customer receives a message that he cannot terminate the booking at this location. With this message 
the customer has the option to display the Car Sharing map with the marked parking facilities. 

In this map the business area, the blocked residential parking spaces, the preferred return areas, the 
free multi-storey car parks and the current position of the vehicle are shown. During the journey the 
location of the vehicle is constantly updated. If the customer terminates the booking at a preferred 
return point or area, then he receives a bonus. 

With Corporate Car Sharing there are no parking fees included and the vehicle generally has to be 
returned at defined locations. 

The vehicle can essentially only be returned at points at which there is a data line to the BMW “back¬ 
end” server. 

The last step is the vehicle check by the Car Sharing module. Only when all windows and doors are 
closed, the vehicle is secured against rolling away and all card payments are made, can the booking 
be terminated. A corresponding note is displayed depending on defects. Up to four payment cards are 
accepted in the vehicle (credit card, fuel card, parking ticket and bonus cards). 

Lastly the customer is notified that the booking is only terminated once the vehicle has been locked 
from the outside and the LED display acknowledges this with a green symbol. 

Locking the vehicle 

The customer can lock his non-locked (booked) vehicle from the outside by holding his authentication 
device at the card reader. 

A vehicle is generally only locked when all doors and the tailgate are closed. 

When a car is parked, the vehicle condition and the parking location are checked if the customer has 
selected one of the options "Parking" or "Terminate booking".

4. Car Sharing 

Depending on the fleet operating company the preconditions of the vehicle monitoring can be defined, 
for example: 

The vehicle condition and the parking location are checked again after the vehicle is locked. If no 
option with regard to the vehicle use was selected, the "Parking" option is accepted. All caps and flaps 
must now be closed and also locked. 

• If the vehicle condition or the parking location are not OK after closing, the red LED flashes 
for a certain period. The defects are shown on the CID control display. Afterwards the red LED 
continues to light up until the vehicle is booked. 

• If "Terminate booking" was selected by the customer in the Car Sharing menu and the vehicle 
condition and the parking location are OK, then the booking is terminated after the vehicle is 
closed and this is displayed with a green LED. 

interaction with navigation 

The customer can obtain support with regard to navigation for the following actions: 

• Display of Car Sharing map: 

The customer can have a map displayed which shows the business area, the prohibited residential 
parking spaces, the preferred return areas, the preferred or free multi-storey car parks and the possible 
filling stations. With Corporate Car Sharing only the possible return areas or the agreed return point 
are shown. The current position is also displayed. During the journey the location is constantly 
updated. 

• Transfer of personal Points of Interest: 

The customer can store his personal destinations (POI - Points Of Interest) in his user account. He can 
then access these in any vehicle and start the route guidance by the navigation system of the vehicle. 

• Route guidance to a specific Car Sharing filling station/charging station: 

The driver can have a list of Points of Interest with the nearest filling stations/charging stations 
displayed. By selecting a Point of Interest the navigation system starts the route guidance to this filling 
station/charging station. 

• Route guidance to a preferred return area or multi-storey car park: 

The driver can have a list of Points of Interest with the nearest preferred return areas or multi¬ 
storey car parks displayed. This selection is also shown to him if he would like to terminate the 
booking outside the business area or would like to park in a prohibited residential parking space. The 
destination selection still works. 

Service and maintenance 

For Service and maintenance by the fleet operating company Car Sharing offers the transmission of 
the vehicle position and the vehicle condition. 

At the end of the booking the vehicle transmits the following information via BMW to the fleet 
operating company:
