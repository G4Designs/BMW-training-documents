Instrument cluster in the 101 


1.1.1. Structure. 

The driving and operating conditions and the state of charge of the high-voltage battery of the 101 are 
displayed in the instrument cluster and if desired in the central information display. 

The instrument cluster of the 101 is installed at the steering column. The displays of the instrument 
cluster of the 101 are thus characterized by the fact that the warning lights are illuminated using LEDs 
and in the central area a 5.7" TFT display shows various pieces of constantly changing information. 
There is a small speaker installed in the instrument cluster which is used to emit the sounds for the 
Check Control messages and the acoustic sound when the turn indicator is activated. 

On the left side there is a button which can be used to reset the trip distance recorder and call up the 
system test and service functions. 

The instrument cluster is always replaced as an entire unit. 

When there is no voltage supply the entire display of the instrument cluster is black.

1. Displays 

The display of the driving style analysis consists of a symbolized road route and a table of values. The 
function is available in ECO PRO mode. The system helps to develop a particularly efficient driving 
style and save energy. The driving style is analyzed for this. The evaluation is effected in different 
categories for acceleration and proactive driving and is shown in the central information display. Using 
this display the individual driving style can be oriented towards an energy-saving style. The last fifteen 
minutes of a trip are evaluated. This way the range of the vehicle can be extended by an efficient 
driving style. 

The road symbolizes the efficiency of the driving style. The more efficient the driving style the 
smoother the route. The table of values contains stars. The more efficient the driving style, the more 
stars there are in the table. In contrast, for an inefficient driving style a wavy road and a reduced 
number of stars are displayed. ECO PRO notes are displayed during the trip as support for an efficient 
driving style. 


1.2.2. "Settings" submenu 

In the "Settings" submenu the following settings can be performed, in addition to the previously 
known settings:

The activation of the DTC is confirmed with a tick. DTC increases the drive on unpaved surfaces as 
braking takes place very late by the DSC unit. However, this reduces the driving stability. The driver is 
notified of this condition with the DSC indicator and warning light in the instrument cluster. Above a 
driving speed of 50 km/h / 30 mph the slip limits are automatically reset again to the normal value. If as 
a result the driving speed of 50 km/h / 30 mph is not reached, the increased slip limits and the resulting 
conditions are active again. The DTC is activated following a terminal change. 


1.3. Displays on the smartphone 

Customers of the 101 have the option to use a variety of remote functions for their vehicle using 
a smartphone (e.g. iPhone™). Using the My BMW i Remote app they can obtain information, also 
when outside the vehicle, about the state of charge of the high-voltage battery, range of the vehicle, 
remaining charge time of the high-voltage battery, inner and ambient temperature of the vehicle, 
as well as the vehicle location. The app also shows the charging stations on a map, which can be 
conveniently sent to the vehicle's navigation system. The charging procedure of the high-voltage 
battery and the preheating/precooling of the passenger compartment can be controlled remotely 
using his app. 

The BMW i Remote app is a further development of the familiar My BMW Remote app, which was 
designed especially for the specific requirements of electric mobility. 



The description for the My BMW i Remote app can be found in the training reference manual "101 
Information and Communication System"

2.1.1. Refuelling 

The volatile elements of gasoline are more prevalent as the outside temperature rises. These gases 
have the ability under pressure absorb a large volume of the respective fluid. This means when 
the volume ratios remain unchanged (e.g. as they are in the fuel tank) pressure is built up by this 
outgassing. This is why in the 101 with W20 combustion engine a pressurised fuel tank made from 
stainless steel is installed. As a result during pure electric driving it is guaranteed that the gasoline 
fumes remain in the pressurised fuel tank. 

This pressurised fuel tank has a fuel tank capacity of 9.0 liters / 2.4 gallons. The pressurised fuel tank 
must be vented before refuelling. The identifying feature for vehicles with a range extender is the fuel 
filler flap in the right front fender.

displayed in the instrument cluster. The fuel filler flap is unlocked after the pressure compensation 
is completed. The fuel filler flap is opened in the normal way. If the fuel filler flap is not opened within 
10 minutes after the fuel filler cap has been unlocked, it is automatically locked again. The position of 
the fuel filler flap is identified using a hall effect sensor. After the refueling process and the closing of 
the fuel filler flap this is locked again using the tank fuel electronics (TFE) control unit.
