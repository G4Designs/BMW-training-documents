101 Passive Safety System 

1. Introduction 

1.1. The hidden protector 

The passive safety system of the 101 is based on the objectives and characteristics of current BMW 
models. The passive safety system fulfills all worldwide legislative requirements. 

The restraint systems ensure that the risk of injury to the occupants of the vehicle involve in a collision 
is reduced. 

The 4th generation Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) is used as the central airbag control unit 
for the passive safety system in the 101. In comparison to other current series, with the passive safety 
system of the 101 the central sensor system is integrated inside the ACSM control unit and not in the 
Integrated Chassis Management (ICM). This is possible with the 101 as the ACSM is located in the 
center of vehicle. 

The ACSM 4 of the 101 is for the first time installed on the FlexRay bus instead of the PT-CAN as in 
previous vehicles. The sensor data of the central sensor system which was previously provided by the 
ICM can be transmitted directly by the ACSM via FlexRay to the DSC. The DSC processes the sensor 
data and makes it available to other bus users.

101 Passive Safety System 

3. Functions 

3.1. Functions of Advanced Crash Safety Module 

The function of the Advanced Crash Safety Module is to permanently evaluate all sensor signals in 
order to identify a crash situation. As a result of the sensor signals and their evaluation, the ACSM 
identifies the direction of the crash and the severity of the impact. 

The ACSM evaluates the information from the sensors then forwards corresponding measures for 
selective activation of the necessary restraint systems. 

The ACSM also monitors the system itself and indicates when it is ready for operation by switching off 
the airbag indicator light. 

If a fault occurs during operation this is stored in a fault memory and can be read out for diagnosis 
purposes. 

If a collision is detected, a crash message is sent to the other bus users in the data bus network 
as notification. The relevant control units respond to this signal by executing their own activities 
according to the severity of the crash. 

The activities include: 

• Unlocking of the door locks 

• Activating the hazard warning flasher 

• Switching on the interior light 

• Making an emergency call 

• Switching off the high-voltage system 

• Switching off the electrical machine of the range extender. 

An additional function of the ACSM is the acoustic seat belt warning that reminds the driver and 
front passenger using visual and acoustic signals to fasten their seat belts. Seat belt buckle switches 
are used to identify whether the driver and/or the front passenger have their seat belts fastened. 
Information on occupancy of the front passenger seat is also included for the acoustic seat belt 
warning. In US market vehicles, the position of the driver and the front passenger seat is also 
monitored. 

The functions of the ACSM generally belong to one of the following areas: 

• Crash-relevant functions 

• System monitoring functions 

• Additional convenience functions. 

3.2. Crash-relevant functions 

The ACSM must fulfill the following crash-relevant functions: 

• Evaluating the sensor signals 

• Impact detection 

• Determining actuators to be activated 


9 




101 Passive Safety System 

3. Functions 


• Specifying the trigger time and trigger sequence 

• Activation of the ignition circuit output stages 

• Sending the crash message to all bus users 

• Crash documentation 

• Emergency call function. 

3.2.1. Evaluating the sensor signals 

The sensors serve to identify and verify front-end, side-on and rear-end crashes and also as roll-over 
detection. 

The sensors are either located inside the ACSM or are directly connected to the module where their 
signals are evaluated and processed. 

3.2.2. Impact detection 

The vehicle is equipped with the following sensors: 

• one lateral and one longitudinal acceleration sensor in the rear doors (green) 

• one airbag sensor to monitor the pressure in each of the front doors (blue) 

• one lateral and one longitudinal acceleration sensor in the ACSM (yellow) 

• one yaw rate sensor in the ACSM (yellow) 

• one vertical acceleration sensor in the ACSM (yellow) 

• one airbag front sensor beside each headlight (red). 

The airbag sensors in the car doors assist with the identification of a side-on crash. 

The airbag front sensors assist with the identification of a head-on crash and the corresponding 
severity.

3.2.3. Trigger time and trigger sequence 

The ACSM uses the values transmitted by the sensors to determine the direction and severity of the 
crash. 

In the case of a head-on crash, corresponding high acceleration values from the longitudinal 
acceleration sensors in the rear doors and ACSM respectively must be detected for example. 

An algorithm determines the severity and direction of the crash based on the accelerations. This 
information is used to assist calculation of the trigger times and sequence in which the restraint 
systems are activated. 

A possible imminent rollover is also detected and the appropriate protection systems are energized. 

3.2.4. Activation of the ignition circuit output stages 

The ACSM is supplied in the BDC with terminal 30B. The ACSM is in offline mode with terminal 30B. 
This means that it is active on the data bus and can perform all diagnostic functions. Triggering of the 
ignition circuits is blocked and is only enabled as of terminal 15 once the system self-test is complete. 
The ACSM is also ready for ignition, even with the logical terminal R. 

The ignition capacitors are recharged via a switching controller. These ignition capacitors make the 
firing energy available in the event of a crash. If the voltage supply is interrupted during a crash, the 
ignition capacitors serve briefly as an energy reserve. 

The ignition circuit output stages consist of a high-side and a low-side power switch. The high-side 
power switch connects the ignition voltage, while the low-side power switch connects to the ground. 
The ignition circuit output stages are controlled by a microcontroller. 


The high-side and low-side power switches also serve to check the ignition circuits during the system 
self-test.

101 Passive Safety System 

3. Functions 


3.2.5. Sending the crash message 

In the event of a collision involving activation of the restraint systems, the ACSM sends a crash 
message to the bus users in the data bus network. 

The activation of the Telematic Communication Box (TCB) is effected parallel via a direct single-wire 
connection. 

The activation of the range extender electrical machine electronics (REME) and the electrical machine 
electronics (EME) is effected by an additional direct two-wire connection. 

As a result, the respective control units perform the following functions depending on the crash 
severity:

3.2.6. Crash documentation 

In the event of a collision where one or more actuators are activated, a crash entry is stored in a non¬ 
erasable memory. After five crash entries, a non-erasable fault entry is stored in the fault code entry 
together with the information that the five crash messages have been saved. The airbag indicator light 
also lights up continuously. 

A_ 

The five crash entries could also be stored during the course of an accident. Each crash entry 
is assigned a system time. The control unit remains ignitable even after five crash entries. The 
crash entries cannot be erased and serve the purpose of subsequent device diagnosis. After 
the fifth crash entree, the control unit must be replaced. 


3.2.7. Emergency call function 

The emergency call functions are available with ConnectedDrive Services. This means an appropriate 
service provider with a call center must be available. A telephone network must also be available in 
order to be able to make an emergency call. 

Manual emergency call 

Drivers who are not directly involved in the accident can use the manual emergency call to request 
assistance. 

The emergency call button is located in the roof function center and is connected to the TCB directly. 
12 









101 Passive Safety System 

3. Functions 


Voice contact with the relevant service provider for the country is established by pressing the 
emergency call button. The voice contact is indicated by a flashing LED in the switch. 

Automatic emergency call 

The ACSM sends a message to the TCB in the event of an accident with corresponding crash severity. 
The TCB sends an emergency call, and also the location of the vehicle if available. 

Attempts are made at the same time to establish a voice contact with the occupants of the vehicle 
in order to obtain more detailed verbal information about the accident (e.g. condition of occupants). 
Further rescue operations can be initiated accordingly. 


3.3. System monitoring functions 

The ACSM has the following system monitoring functions: 

• System self-test (pre-drive check) 

• Display of system operability 

• Cyclic monitoring 

• Fault display and fault storage 

• Output of faults (diagnosis) 

• Acoustic and visual seat belt warning 

• Deactivation of the front passenger airbag and side airbag and knee airbag . 


3.3.1. System self test 

The ACSM performs a system self test from terminal 15. The airbag indicator light is energized for 
roughly five seconds during the system self test. 

Once the system self test is complete and no faults have been identified, the airbag indicator light 
goes out and the system is ready to operate. 

3.3.2. Display of system operability 

The airbag indicator light in the instrument cluster goes out to indicate that the ACSM is ready for 
operation. 

3.3.3. Cyclic monitoring 

Once the system self-test has been successfully concluded and the system is ready for operation, a 
cyclic monitoring procedure is performed for fault monitoring purposes. This monitoring serves the 
internal diagnosis of the control unit and overall airbag system. Monitoring takes place continuously 
from terminal 15. It is also continued when the logical terminal R is reached. 


13 




101 Passive Safety System 

3. Functions 


3.3.4. Fault display and fault storage 

The ACSM has a non-volatile fault memory. The airbag indicator light lights up to indicate a fault entry. 
Events, such as the activation of an airbag or automatic tensioner, are also stored in the fault memory. 

A 

if the fault memory contains the entry that the restraint system has been activated, this 
only means the ignited restraint system is not available for further activation and not that it 
malfunctioned during the crash. 


3.3.5. Output of faults (diagnosis) 

The fault memory can be read out via the diagnostic interface with the assistance of the Integrated 
Service Technical Application (ISTA) in the BMW diagnosis system. After repairing the faults or after 
renewing activated components, the fault memory can be cleared with the diagnosis command "Clear 
fault memory". 

3.3.6. Acoustic and visual seat belt warning 

An acoustic and visual seat belt warning is a standard feature of all vehicles equipped with the ACSM. 
The ACSM records whether or not the driver or front passenger have fastened their seat belts. If they 
have not, an acoustic and visual warning is output to remind them to fasten their seat belts. Both seat 
belt buckle switches are monitored separately. 


14 




101 Passive Safety System 

3. Functions 

3.3.7. Deactivating the airbag 

CIS seat mat 

The airbag is deactivated automatically in order to satisfy the regulations of the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). When the child seats listed in the regulation are occupied by a 
child this must lead to deactivation of the airbag. 

A seat occupancy mat is used on the front passenger seat for the purpose of occupancy detection and 
classification of occupants in the front passenger seat. In the 101 a capacitive interior sensing floor mat 
(CIS floor mat) is used. 

The CIS mat is made up of two elements: A sensor wire, which runs parallel to the seat heating in 
the seat cushion and an evaluation unit. The CIS mat measures the capacity and ohmic resistance 
between the sensor wire (anode) and the vehicle ground (cathode) at a frequency of 120 kHz. The 
CIS mat determines from the change in capacity and resistance whether the front passenger seat is 
occupied by an adult or a child in a child seat. 

The deactivation of the front passenger airbag, the side airbag and knee airbag on the front passenger 
side is signalled by the indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation. 

The indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation in the roof function center lights up if 
a child seat with child for e.g. a child restraint system that has been tested in accordance with the 
NHTSA regulations and is holding a small child was detected on the front passenger seat or if the front 
passenger seat is unoccupied. 

The display brightness is controlled by automatic regulation of the display illumination.

4. System Components 

4.2.1. Lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensors, rear door 

The lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensors in the rear doors assist with the identification of 
head-on crashes, side-on crashes and rear-end crashes. 

The rear door airbag sensor consists of a longitudinal acceleration sensor and a lateral acceleration 
sensor. The acceleration sensors measure both the acceleration and the deceleration in the X and Y 
directions. The resultant from the X and Y signals is decisive in identifying the direction of the crash. 
The airbag sensors in the rear doors assist with the identification of head-on, side-on and rear-end 
crashes. The rear door airbag sensors on the left and right are of identical design and are allocated by 
way of mechanical coding during installation. 



101 lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensors in the rear door 


4.2.2. Door airbag sensor (pressure) 

Pressure sensors are installed in the driver and front passenger doors. Side crashes are identified with 
the assistance of the airbag sensors. In addition to the lateral acceleration values that are present, the 
pressure in the door cavity also increases in the event of a side-on crash. 

The airbag sensors in the doors serve to verify the plausibility of the acceleration signals from the rear 
door airbag sensors and the ACSM when a side crash is detected. The airbag sensors are situated in 
the inner panel of the doors and measure the increase in pressure in the event of a side collision. In the 
event of a side collision with the door, the outer skin is pressed inward, thus reducing the door interior 
and increasing the inner pressure. This pressure change is measured by the airbag sensors. The 


17 




101 Passive Safety System 

4. System Components 

airbag sensor also includes electronics, in addition to the pressure sensor, that digitize the pressure 
readings and transmit them to the ACSM. The data transfer is effected analogue to the airbag sensors 
in the rear doors. The pressure readings are evaluated in the ACSM. 



101 Door airbag sensor (pressure) 


4.2.3. Front sensor 

Two airbag front sensors are installed beside the headlights. The measured values are forwarded to 
the ACSM where they are evaluated. 

The airbag front sensors on the left and right assist with the identification of a head-on crash. 

They deliver additional information to the ACSM on the characteristics and severity of the collision. 
Each sensor contains an acceleration sensor for recording the deceleration, signal processing 
technology and electronics for data transfer. The measured values are sent in the form of a message to 
the ACSM and are used in the calculation of the algorithm.

4.2.4. Sensors in the ACSM 

In the 101 the central sensor system in integrated in the ACSM control unit. The ACSM contains a 
longitudinal and lateral acceleration sensor, a vertical acceleration sensor and a yaw rate sensor for 
impact detection. The ACSM also includes a longitudinal and lateral acceleration sensor and a yaw 
sensor for the driving dynamics control. 

The sensor data for impact detection are evaluated in the ACSM and helps identify side-on, rear-end 
or head-on crashes and assists with roll-over detection. The sensor data not yet evaluated for the 
driving dynamics control is sent to the DSC control unit via FlexRay, where it is processed.

4.2.5. CIS mat 

The capacitive interior sensing mat (CIS mat) is fitted in the front passenger seat instead of the seat 
occupancy mat. The CIS mat can detect whether the front passenger seat is occupied by an adult or a 
child in a child seat. The deactivation of the front passenger airbag and side airbag and knee airbag on 
the front passenger side is signalled by the indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation. 

4.2.6. Seat belt buckle switch 

The seat belt buckle switches are located in the seat belt buckles of the driver and front passenger 
seat. 

The seat belt buckle switch detects whether the seat belt buckle tongue is in the seat belt buckle. The 
ACSM supplies power to the sensors and performs the evaluation. 

From terminal 15, the seat belt buckle switch is permanently monitored and used for the visual and 
acoustic seat belt warning and also to determine which restraint systems are triggered.

4.2.8. Seat-position sensors 

The job of the seat-position detector is to distinguish between a relatively small person and a person 
of normal height within the lengthways adjustment range of the seat. This detection is another 
technical feature aimed at increasing the safety of the occupants. The deployment of the three airbag 
stages is then adjusted to the driver's/front passenger's seat position. 

The seat-position detector takes the form of a 2-wire hall effect sensor and is supplied with power via 
the ACSM control unit. The current level of the seat-position sensor changes depending on the seat 
position.

4.3.3. Front passenger airbag 

The purpose of the front passenger airbag is to reduce the risk of accident to the front passenger in 
the event of a front-end crash. The front passenger airbag is located in the dashboard. When the front 
passenger airbag expands, the dashboard tears open at defined points. The front passenger airbag of 
the 101 is not supported at the windshield like in other BMW vehicles, but only at the dashboard. 

A two-stage generator is used to activate the stages at short or long time differences, depending on 
the severity of the crash detected and taking into consideration the seat position. 

The front passenger airbag features an active vent valve.

4.3.4. Knee airbag 

A knee airbag is also required on the driver's side and front passenger side to control the forwards 
displacement of the occupant(s) in the event of a front-end crash.

4.3.5. Head airbag 

Head airbags are installed in the 101 to protect the occupants' heads in the event of a side collision. 

The head airbag extends from the A-pillar to the C-pillar and covers the entire area of the side 
windows. It expands between the occupants and side structure. 

System features: 

• Extended covered area across all front and rear side windows 

• Protection of occupants from glass splinters 

• Covered area for different-sized occupants optimized.

4.3.6. Side airbag 

As with all current models, the side airbag at the front ignites out of the front seat backrest. 

The side airbags and gas generators are in a plastic housing, the airbag module. This is installed in the 
front seat backrest and is concealed by the seat cover. 

If activated, the side airbag emerges outwards from the backrest frame and spreads between the side 
structure and occupant.

It is important to ensure that no additional seat covers are fitted as they would greatly impair the 
function of the side airbag, or even immobilize it altogether.

Connection of ignition circuit, adaptive force limiter 


An automatic tensioner with adaptive force limiter for the driver and front passenger is used. The gas 
generator-assisted automatic tensioner ensures that the seat belt strap is reeled in to reduce belt slack 
prior to forwards displacement of the occupants. 

The adaptive force limiter switches from a high level force to a low level force depending on the 
position of the seat with the assistance of a gas generator in order to reduce the retaining force of the 
seat belt during the crash depending on the size of the occupant. The further forward the seat is, the 
earlier the changeover takes place. 

When properly timed with the airbag, it ensures the kinetic energy acting on the occupants is more 
evenly dissipated for the duration of the head-on collision. 

4.3.8. Safety battery terminal 

The safety battery terminal is triggered at different thresholds when the ACSM detects a front-end, 
side-on or rear-end crash of sufficient severity. The following lines are separated pyrotechnically:

• Battery positive wire for the electrical machine electronics (EME) 

• Battery positive wire for the integrated supply module (in vehicles with range extender) 

• Terminal 30C for battery management electronics (SME). 

In the event of a missing signal from terminal 30C, the SME performs a quick shut-down of the high- 
voltage system. 

The safety battery terminal is located directly at the positive terminal of the battery. The safety battery 
terminal is encased completely in plastic so that in the event of separation no sparks get outside the 
case. 

Even though the safety battery terminal has been disconnected, a voltage supply to all safety-relevant 
consumers such as hazard warning flashers, interior light, airbag and telephone (including emergency 
call) is ensured.

4.3.9. Airbag indicator light 

The airbag indicator light is located on the instrument panel. The airbag indicator light lights up then 
goes out during the pre-drive check to signal readiness of the ACSM and passive safety systems. The 
airbag indicator light is controlled by a message on the FlexRay from the ACSM via the BDC to the 
instrument cluster. The instrument panel receives a message cyclically. If the message remains off, the 
airbag indicator light is activated.

4.3.11. Indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation 

The indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation in the 101 is in the roof function center. The 
indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation is automatically activated if the CIS mat detects 
a small child in a child seat or if the front passenger seat is unoccupied. 

The brightness of the indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation is controlled via the 
automatic brightness control of the display illumination.
