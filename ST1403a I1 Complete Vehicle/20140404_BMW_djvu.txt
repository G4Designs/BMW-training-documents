GENERAL POWERTRAIN DEMANDS. 



BMWGroup, Dr. J. Merwerth, 20.03.2014, Workshop University Lund 


-High efficiency 

Increase range and reduce battery costs 

- Low weight 

Due to the Light weight concept i3 & i8 

-Direct connected power electronic 

Avoiding EMC problems and plugs 

- Lowest possible AC current 

Reducing connections and inverter costs 

-Single speed gearbox (i3) 

Reducing system complexity and weight 

-Wide range of constant power 

Necessary due to single speed gearbox

MOTOR OF THE BMW i3. 

HYBRID SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR. 


Two layer magnet arrangement 

- very sinusoidal induced voltage 

- high difference Ld - Lq 

High Number of pole pairs (p = 6) 

- to reduce the yoke weight 

Iron mass reduced to the absolute 
necessary dimensions 

- special attention to the mechanical 
strength

MOTOR PERFORMANCE. 
MEASURED EFFICIENCY. 


- During a normal drive cycle the most 
energy conversion will take part at low 
torque. 

- In this operating area, the iron losses 
are dominant and have to be 
minimized. 

> Machine topology (HSM) 

> Thin iron sheets in the stator 

> Special rotor geometry (additional 
slits)

MECHANICAL DESIGN. 
LIGHT WEIGHT CONCEPT. 


-High number of pole pairs (6) to 
reduce the mass of the stator and 
rotor yoke. 

-Rotor iron reduced to the absolute 
necessary dimensions regarding: 

-Flux conduction 

-Mechanical strength

CONCLUSIONES. 


-The hybrid synchronous motor is the 
most suitable drive regarding the 
powertrain demands of the i3 & i8. 

-The use of the reluctance torque 
provides a high available power in the 
upper speed range. 

- Furthermore the efficiency is very high 
in a wide operating area. 

-First electric Motor completely 
designed and produced by the BMW 
Group.
