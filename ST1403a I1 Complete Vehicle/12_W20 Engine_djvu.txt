W20 Engine 
1. Introduction 


The BMW 101 with eDrive was primarily developed for urban use. The purely electric motor ensures 
emissions-free mobility and is the modern way of transportation in the city or when commuting. As 
many customers, do not want to do without a high range, an optional range extender (REX) in the BMW 
101 offers the possibility of extending the range. The 2-cylinder engine is a small, very smooth and 
quiet gasoline engine, which powers a e-machine and delivers the necessary energy to extend the 
driving range. As a result, the state of charge of the battery can be kept constant so that the vehicle 
can continue to drive using the electrical machine. As soon as the state of charge of the battery 
reaches a critical level, the range extender ensures enough energy is available to reach the destination. 
The range extender is therefore only started by the vehicle electronics if required. In order to realize 
the lowest possible fuel consumption and reduce CO 2 emissions, the gasoline engine also has an 
automatic start-stop function and other intelligent operating strategies. 

The range extender W20K06U0 is described in this document.

Full load diagram W20K06U0 engine 

The operation of the range extender has no influence on the driveability of the vehicle. Only the 
electrical output power is relevant, which the W20 engine generates by an e-machine. The graphic 
shows the power data of the combustion engine. Depending on the operating strategy in the BMW 
101, a maximum power of 25 kW / 34 hp at a speed of 4300 rpm is used at the time of introduction. The 
W20 engine powers an e-machine. An efficiency level of approx. 94 % is achieved, which corresponds 
to a maximum output power of the e-machine of 23.5 kW at a speed of 4300 rpm.

2.1.1. Crankcase 

The upper crankcase comprises a one-piece compound structure made from die-cast aluminium. The 
cylinder liners are made from grey cast iron and moulded. The lower crankshaft is connected using 
liquid seal. This is also made from die-cast aluminium. 

2.1.2. Cylinder head gasket 

A multilayer spring steel gasket is used for the cylinder head gasket. 

2.1.3. Cylinder head and cover 

The cylinder head is made from aluminium gravity die casting and water-cooled. Four valves are 
positioned in each cylinder, which are actuated via bucket tappet by two upper camshafts. 

In the upper area a cylinder head cover with a rubber seal closes the cylinder head at four bolting 
points. An oil filler neck, the connection for the crankcase ventilation and a camshaft sensor are also 
integrated here. The cylinder head cover is connected to the cylinder head via a ground strap in order 
to prevent a static charge.

2.2.1. Crankshaft with bearings 

Crankshaft 

The crankshaft is forged from high-strength steel, has a stroke of 66 mm and is positioned in three 
bearing positions with lead free multi-component bearings. The diameter of the crank journal 
corresponds to the diameter of the main bearing and is 42 mm. Two thrust washers for adjusting the 
end clearance are positioned at the middle main bearing.

Bearing frame 

The upper crankcase and a bearing frame hold the crankshaft bearing shells and the bearing shells of 
the counterbalance shafts. Both components are screwed together at several attachment points. 

Torsion shaft 

The crankshaft is force-fitted to the range extender electrical machine via a tensioned torsion shaft. 

2.2.2. Connecting rod and piston 

The 113 mm long connecting rods are forged from steel. The connecting rod is split at the 42 mm 
bearing position and milled smooth. In addition to mounting with connecting rod bolts, cylindrical pins 
are used for centering. The connecting rod bearing shells are designed as lead-free multi-component 
slide bearings. The small connecting rod eye has a brass bushing for mounting the 18 mm wrist pin. 
The light metal box pistons are cast and only weigh 200 g. The wrist pins are offset by 0.8 mm.

2.3. Counterbalance shafts 

The compensation of the inertia forces and torques exerted which arise through the rotating 
and oscillating movements of the crankshaft drive is realized for this design by two additional 
counterbalance shafts. For smooth and vibration-free engine running, the crankshaft on the e- 
machine side drives two counterbalance shafts via spur gears. Both counterbalance shafts have two 
counterweights offset by 90°. These rotate at the same speed as the crankshaft, but in the opposite 
direction. This arrangement of the mass balance functions with very low friction losses, which in turn 
benefits the efficiency of the engine.

2.3.1. Crankcase venting components 

The blow-by gases arising during the combustion cycle make it into the crankcase between piston 
rings and cylinder wall. These cannot be released into the atmosphere. For this reason the gases from 
the crankcases are fed back to the combustion chamber via the differentiated air intake system. Oil 
particles in the blow-by gases are separated beforehand and fed back to the oil sump. The cleaned 
blow-by gases then make it to the differentiated air intake system. The following graphic shows the 
layout and the operating principle of the crankcase ventilation.

Operating principle 

The blow-by gases are guided through the upper counterbalance shaft (9). The first separation of 
the oil particles take place via a radial vent hole (8) by the balance weight. Through the rotational 
movement of the shaft and the resulting centrifugal force oil particles are fed back to the crankcase 
via the vent hole (8). The blow-by gases now go from the counterbalance shaft directly to the oil 
separator (5) via the intake pipe (12). The oil particles are collected here and flow back into the engine 
via the return line (6) by the non-return valve (7). The cleaned blow-by gas in the oil separator is guided 
through the intake pipe (4) via the pressure control valve (2) to the differentiated air intake system. 

The throttle valve is adjusted so that a vacuum is available in the differentiated air intake system. The 
pressure control valve (2) adjusts a vacuum of maximum 60 mbar in the crankcase. 

Through the arising vacuum in the crankcase fresh air is drawn in to the crankcase via a purge air line 
(13) with non-return valve (1) directly via the cylinder head cover. The combustion engine is therefore 
flushed with fresh air. 


2.4. Camshaft drive 

The pressed camshaft sprockets of the camshafts are driven via a toothed chain by a small gear on 
the crankshaft. The chain is guided without play around the camshaft sprockets with a guide and 
tensioning rail and a spring-loaded, maintenance-free chain tensioner. 

The piston of the chain tensioner is pressed at the tensioning rail using a torsion spring. The thrust 
piece automatically drives outwards via a thread in the event of a stretched timing chain. With this 
design the thrust piece can no longer move back independently.

2.5. Valve gear 


2.5.1. Design 

The eight valves are actuated by the cams directly via a bucket tappet with a diameter of 28 mm. 

The valve clearance is set correctly during the plant installation of the engine by adjustment plates, 
which sit in the valve spring retainer under the bucket tappets. The valves are designed with a shaft 
diameter of 5 mm, have different valve diameters on the intake and exhaust side and are designed in 
valve guides made from sintered metal. Eight similar valve springs ensure the valves close. The valve 
angle of 12° at the intake and 14° at the exhaust valves create a compact combustion chamber and 
good flow conditions for the gas exchange and thus have extremely efficient combustion processes.

3.2. Components for the oil supply 

The oil pump draws in the oil from the oil sump below via the pick up tube and delivers it via the oil 
filter and the engine oil-coolant heat exchanger to the bearing positions in the engine and cylinder 
head. The lower counterbalance shaft is driven via the crankshaft and is tightly connected to the oil 
pump drive by a gear.

3.3. Oil pump and pressure control 

The oil pump is designed as a rotor pump. The ring-shaped operating chamber holds an outer rotor 
with inner teeth and an inner rotor with outer teeth. These can be rotated in the operating chamber 
so that the inner and outer teeth interlock. The drive shaft is firmly connected to the inner rotor. With 
the rotational movement the spaces between the outer and inner rotor are permanently reduced and 
enlarged. As a result, on the one hand the engine oil is drawn in via the oil pump filter and, on the 
other hand, the engine oil is compressed and delivered to the engine oil-coolant heat exchanger in the 
output duct. In the oil pump housing a control valve is installed with an opening pressure of approx. 

5.2 bar. The oil pump is powered via a pair of gears by the lower counterbalance shaft.

3.4. Engine oil cooling 

The W20 engine has an oil-to-water heat exchanger for cooling the engine oil which is attached on 
the outlet side in the upper crankcase. Before the oil reaches the lubrication points in the engine, it 
is fed through the heat exchanger. This has two advantages: In the cold-start phase, on the one hand 
through the quick increase of the coolant temperature the engine oil is brought quicker to operating 
temperature. On the other hand, the engine oil is cooled if the coolant temperature is lower than the 
engine oil temperature. 


3.5. Oil pressure monitoring 

In addition to the oil-to-water heat exchanger, the oil pressure switch is also located in the upper 
crankcase. This is used for monitoring the oil pressure and issues a signal to the engine control unit if 
the pressure falls below 0.5 bar. 


3.6. Oil spray nozzles 

In the W20 engine, some of the components which cannot be reached directly by an oil duct are 
lubricated and cooled by oil spray nozzles. The piston crown and gudgeon pin are permanently 
sprayed and cooled via two oil spray nozzles in the upper crankcase. A non-return valve is integrated 
here, which only opens from an oil pressure of approx. 2.3 bar. Each cylinder has its own oil spray 
nozzle, which obtains the correct installation position through its styling.

As a purely electric vehicle without range extender, the BMW 101 has a cooling circuit for the high- 
voltage components. If a range extender is installed, then the necessary cooling of the combustion 
engine is done by a second cooling circuit. The entire cooling system of the BMW 101 is shown in the 
graphic. In the following details are provided on the cooling circuit of the W20 engine. Information on 
the cooling circuit of the high-voltage system can be found in the training reference manual "101 High- 

voltage Components' 

il 

4.2. Cooling system 

The recirculation of the coolant is guaranteed using a conventional coolant pump and the control of 
the cooling system using a thermostat wax element. The engine is washed with the coolant according 
to the cross flow concept. An engine oil-to-coolant heat exchanger (3) is connected in parallel in 
the coolant feed line. This ensures that in the event of a very high speed of the combustion engine 
the engine oil temperature does not become too high. The expansion tank (1) only has a minimum 
and maximum mark to control the level. The pressure relief valve in the sealing cap of the expansion 
tank opens from 1.4 bar. The following graphics show the installation locations and layout of the 
components with the direction of flow of the coolant.

If oil or coolant emerges from the leakage bore hole (7), this indicates a leaking radial shaft seal. The 
repair instructions must be followed.

The cooling circuit of the W20 engine is connected to the cooling circuit of the high-voltage 
components via a coolant-to-coolant heat exchanger (10). A thermostat (9) integrates the heat 
exchanger from a coolant temperature of 85° C in the cooling circuit and is completely opened from 
95° C. In the following graphic the direction of flow of the coolant is shown when the thermostat is 
open. If the thermostat is closed, the coolant flows back to the coolant pump via the coolant hose (6). 
The coolant-to-coolant heat exchanger is therefore not integrated at a coolant temperature below 85° 
C.

4.2.1. Coolant pump 

The purely mechanical coolant pump forms one unit with the coolant pump wheel and the shaft. This 
is force-fitted to the oil pump shaft (7). In the event of a leak in the radial shaft seals the water pump 
wheel with shaft must be removed. In order to access the circlip (5), the oil sump and the panel (9) 
secured with two screws in the lower crankcase (10) must be disassembled.

4.2.2. Thermostat 

Coolant is always flowing in the expansion element in the inside of the thermostat. At a coolant 
temperature of 85° C the thermostat begins to open and completely clears the way via the coolant-to- 
coolant heat exchanger from 95° C. 


4.3. Heat management 

The cooling of the W20 engine is regulated via the mechanical coolant pump, the coolant-to-coolant 
heat exchanger and the thermostat. The delivery rate and also the flow rate through the coolant pump 
are solely defined by the speed of the crankshaft. There is no electrical control here. 

If the coolant temperature rises above 85° C, the additional coolant-to-coolant heat exchanger is 
integrated in the cooling circuit via the thermostat. The maximum flow rate in the cooling circuit of the 
W20 engine is 35 l/min, in the cooling circuit of the high-voltage system 17 l/min. At a maximum load of 
the combustion engine the coolant temperature in the outlet area of the cylinder head is approx. 95° C. 
With the additional heat exchanger it is possible to reduce the coolant temperature by approx. 10° C. 

The coolant temperature is recorded using a coolant temperature sensor in the coolant duct at the 
cylinder head. If this temperature rises above a defined value, the driver is informed via the central 
information display. An intervention by the engine control RDME to reduce the engine performance or 
switch off the combustion engine is not effected.

4.3.2. Temperature monitoring of the engine compartment 

The combustion engine is encapsulated in order to keep the noise generation when the combustion 
engine is running as low as possible. In order to avoid the components in the engine compartment 
overheating, an electric fan is located in the rear-wheel drive near the drive unit of the vehicle. As soon 
as the W20 engine is started, the EDME also activates the electric fan. This runs permanently until 
the combustion engine is shut down again. Depending on the engine compartment temperature, 
which is measured using two temperature sensors in the rear-wheel drive, the fan can also run on for 
up 11 minutes, also when the ignition is switched off. This way it is guaranteed that regardless of the 
operating condition of the vehicle no components are damaged as a result of excessive temperatures 
in the engine compartment. 

A_ 

The combustion engine is switched off straight away during operation if excessive heat is identified by 
the two temperature sensors.

and can no longer be opened. A replacement of the air cleaner is not planned. Via a fresh-air 
duct, intake air reaches the clean air duct via the filter element. The intake silencer is stored in a 
disconnected state and includes the bracket for the RDME control unit in the upper area.

The differentiated air intake system is connected to the clean air pipe via the throttle valve by an 
additional adapter. At the adapter the turbulence line and the ventilation line with non-return valve 
are secured using snap fasteners. The turbulence lines generate a swirling effect as a result of the air 
flow upstream from the intake valve during the mixture preparation. The combustion becomes more 
efficient as a result. The function primarily has an effect in the partial load range as with a small throttle 
opening the vacuum in the intake pipe is greatest and thus a higher volumetric flow is achieved in the 
turbulence lines.

During the development of the individual components the aim was to reduce the arising noise level 
of the exhaust as much as possible. The heat development in the entire exhaust system should also 
be kept as low as possible through quick release of the exhaust gas. Due to narrow spatial conditions 
in the engine compartment the exhaust system was also developed with a very compact design. An 
air-gap-insulated exhaust manifold enables the catalytic converter near the engine to heat up quickly 
through minimal heat losses. The operating temperature of the catalytic converter is reached quicker 
after the engine cold start. A control sensor is located directly behind the exhaust manifold outlet. The 
monitoring sensor is positioned after the ceramic monolith. The rear silencer is connected using a 
decoupling element.

For the operation of the range extender the vehicle is equipped with a pressurised fuel tank made from 
stainless steel. As a result during purely electric driving it is guaranteed that the gasoline fumes remain 
in the pressurised fuel tank. Only through the operation with a range extender is fresh air drawn in by 
the carbon canister for purging and the gasoline fumes are directed to the combustion chamber via the 
differentiated air intake system. The fuel tank capacity is 9 liters / 2.38 gallons with a 2 liter / .5 gallon 
fuel reserve.

7.5. Refuelling 

The pressurised fuel tank must be bled for refuelling. In this way it is guaranteed that the tank request 
is indicated to the electronics by a button in the passenger compartment of the vehicle. The hybrid 
pressure refueling electronic control unit TFE monitors the current operating condition via a pressure 
temperature sensor in the fuel tank and then controls the pressure reduction by opening the fuel tank 
isolation valve. The clean gasoline fumes are released into the environment via the carbon canister. 
The actuator drive for locking the fuel filler flap is activated and the fuel filler flap with fuel filler cap can 
be opened manually. 

A 

Before repair work on the fuel supply the refueling procedure must be started so that the pressure 
in the fuel tank can be released. Leave the fuel filler cap open in order to avoid pressure building up 
again. 


At the same time, the driver receives the status of the tank readiness displayed in the instrument 
cluster and in the central information display. If the fuel filler flap is not opened within 10 minutes after 
the fuel filler cap has been released, it is automatically locked again. The position of the fuel filler flap is 
identified using a hall effect sensor. 


After the refueling procedure and the fuel filler cap is closed the fuel filler flap is locked again via the 
hybrid pressure refueling electronic control unit and the fuel tank isolation valve closed. The displays in 
the instrument cluster and central information display are removed.

No charging and refueling at the same time! When the charging cable is inserted do not initiate a 
refueling procedure and keep a safe distance from highly flammable materials. Otherwise, in the event 
of incorrect connection or removal of the charging cable there is a risk of personal injury or material 
damage by burning fuel for example. 


7.6. Tank leak diagnosis 

After the shutdown phase of the vehicle (terminal 15 OFF) a test of the tank leak diagnosis is initiated 
by the hybrid pressure refueling electronic control unit TFE control unit. This is carried out over a 
period of approx. 6 hours. In this period the temperature and the pressure in the stainless steel tank 
are measured. As the pressure changes depending on the temperature, it is possible to identify a 
pressure loss in the fuel tank using a stored characteristic curve in the control unit. A prerequisite is 
therefore that the temperature changes over the test period. If this does not happen no results can be 
concluded. 

The ambient air pressure is also included in the calculation of the characteristic curve. An internal 
sensor in the RDME control unit determines this value and makes this information available to the 
hybrid pressure refueling electronic control unit via the PT-CAN. 

If during the test phase the vehicle is started no result can be evaluated. Each time after the shutdown 
phase of the vehicle the tank leak diagnosis restarts via the TFE control unit. 

Following a comparison of the measured pressure readings with the saved characteristic curve in the 
control unit, information is transmitted to the RDME via the PT-CAN in the case of a deviation from the 
hybrid pressure refueling electronic control unit. A corresponding entry is set in the control unit. This 
happens as soon as the ignition of the vehicle is switched on.

Module 1,81 pins 


Two modules combine the control unit to the wiring harness of the vehicle. Module 2 with the 40 pins 
includes the connections for the fuel injectors, ignition coils, the intake air temperature and pressure 
sensor and the knock sensor. Module 1 with the 81 pins assumes the remainder of the sensors 
and actuators. The printed circuit board in the RDME control unit accommodates two sensors: a 
temperature sensor and an ambient pressure sensor. The temperature sensor is used to monitor 
the temperature of the components in the RDME control unit. The ambient pressure is required for 
calculating the mixture composition. 

8.2.1. Overall function 

The Range Extender Digital Engine Electronics RDME is the computing and switching center of 
the engine control. Sensors on the engine and the vehicle deliver the input signals. The signals for 
activating the actuators are calculated from the input signals, the setpoint values calculated using a 
computing model in the DME control unit and the stored characteristic maps. The RDME control unit 
activates the actuators directly or via relays. 

The RDME control unit is woken up via the wake-up line (terminal 15 Wake up) by the Body Domain 
Controller (BDC). 


52 













W20 Engine 

8. Engine Electrical System 


The engine control takes into consideration a variety of factors. The basis of the control is the amount 
of air drawn in, which is defined indirectly via the intake pipe vacuum and the engine speed. The 
engine control establishes individual coordinated values for the fuel injection rate and the ignition point 
from additional engine and ambient parameters such as coolant temperature, intake air temperature, 
throttle valve position and ambient air pressure, together with stored characteristic maps and 
correction functions. 

An unequal firing interval from 450° kW and 270° kW results from the crankpin offset. The different 
work cycle of cylinders 1 and 2, as well as the resulting firing interval, can be seen in the following 
graphic.

The after-run starts after terminal 15 OFF. The adaptation values are stored during the after-run. 

The RDME control unit uses a bus signal to indicate its readiness to "go to sleep". When all the 
participating control units have signalled their readiness to “go to sleep”, the bus master outputs a bus 
signal and the control units terminate communication five seconds later.

W20 Engine 

9. Operating Strategy in the BMW 101 

9.1. Overview 

The operating strategy describes the interaction of the drive components in the vehicle. In this chapter 
details are provided on the behavior of the W20 engine. This includes when and how the combustion 
engine is operated in the complete system. 

The BMW 101 is equipped with a purely electric drive system. The energy required for the operation 
of the electrical machine is stored in the high-voltage battery. The range of the vehicle is therefore 
limited. The optional range extender powers an e-machine, where current is supplied to the high- 
voltage intermediate circuit. Depending on requirements the current flows directly to the motor of the 
electrical machine or to the high-voltage battery unit. The aim is to keep the state of charge (SOC) at a 
constant level. The range of the vehicle can thus be extended. 

The operating strategy is shown in the following graphic. The available power and thus the state 
of charge of the high-voltage battery is defined between 0 and 100 %. It is important to note that 
these are relative values and not absolute values. When driving without a combustion engine (4) the 
energy required is taken from the high-voltage battery. The state of charge (1) drops continuously 
and reaches the switch-on threshold (2). The combustion engine is now started and powers an e- 
machine. Depending on the driving style it is now possible to keep the state of charge of the high- 
voltage battery constant or even increase it (3). If the state of charge rises again above the switch-on 
threshold (2), the combustion engine is switched off. 

The driving style has a direct influence on the discharge of the high-voltage battery and thus also on 
the range. A comparison of the performance data at full load should highlight this: 

• 25 kW / 34 hp mechanical output power of the combustion engine 

• 23.5 kW electrical output power of the e-machine 

• 125 kW power diversion by the electrical machine. 

Using this example at full load it is clear that this driving style leads to a further drop in the state of 
charge of the high-voltage battery. The output power of the combustion engine and thus the e- 
machine is not sufficient to keep the state of charge of the high-voltage constant.

9.2. Influencing factors 

During the development of the BMW 101 the objective was to eliminate interference noises by 
the combustion engine and, at the same time, generate a sound pattern typical of the brand. This 
combined with a comfortable extension of the range. For this reason the output power and thus the 
speed of the range extender are influenced by various parameters. On the one hand, these are defined 
by the acoustics and range strategy, and, on the other hand, the ambient temperature also has a 
significant influence on the output power. 

In order to bring the combustion engine and the catalytic converter to operating temperature, the 
combustion engine is operated at a speed of 2,200 rpm - 2,400 rpm during the warm-up phase 
(5). This is dependent on the speed driven and, at the same time, represents the idle speed of the 
combustion engine. The period for this warm-up phase is roughly 360 seconds depending on the 
ambient temperature. 

The speed varies accordingly between 2,200 rpm and 4,300 rpm and also the output power of the 
combustion engine depending on the speed driven and the state of charge of the high-voltage battery. 
The resulting acoustics of the combustion engine are regulated conveniently by controlling the speed 
subject to the speed driven. In order to extend the range the engine speed is also influenced by the 
state of charge of the high-voltage battery. 

The following graphic highlights the different operating conditions. If we now take a look at the blue 
line (5), which shows the engine speed range for the state of charge from 6.5 - 3.5 %. At a speed 
of 50 km/h the combustion engine is operated at a speed of 2,400 rpm. If the state of charge of the 
high-voltage battery drops, then the speed characteristic curve in the diagram moves to the left with 
a simultaneous increase of the maximum speed. Depending on the speed drive the speed of the 
combustion engine is increased earlier. More energy is made available to the high-voltage system.

The dependence of the output power on engine speed and state of charge of the high-voltage 
battery was shown. Depending on the driving style and ambient temperature, different thermal 
conditions arise in the engine compartment, which also have to be considered for the control of 
the range extender. Therefore, the performance of the combustion engine is also influenced by the 
measured values of the outside temperature sensor. This is referred to as a thermal operating strategy. 
At extreme ambient temperatures the output power and the speed are reduced via a temperature 
model in the engine control unit RDME. As described in chapter 4.3.2, the engine compartment 
temperature is measured and monitored using two sensors and in extreme cases the combustion 
engine is switched off. 


9.3. Automatic engine start/stop function 

The combustion engine also has an automatic engine start-stop function. This function is not available 
during the warm-up phase. To activate the automatic engine start-stop function the presence of the 
driver must be detected using the seat belt and door contact. As long as the seat belt is inserted and 
the door is closed, the driver is considered present and the range extender is operated with automatic 
engine start-stop function. 

The combustion engine is switched off under the following conditions:

• SOC 3.5 - 6.5% 

• Speed < 10 km/h / 6 mph 

If the driving speed is greater than 20 km/h /12 mph, the combustion engine is restarted. 

During the warm-up phase of the combustion engine or if the state of charge drops below 3.5% the 
automatic engine start-stop function is deactivated. 


9.4. Automatic service 

After a period of roughly eight weeks the combustion engine is automatically started. The 
identification of the standstill time is effected via the EDME control unit. An automatic start is required 
to guarantee the operational reliability of the range extender. 

The process is indicated to the driver via a Check Control message during driving. The duration of 
the engine running is dependent on the starting temperature of the combustion engine. The driver 
is informed about the duration of the service via a time bar in the central information display. If the 
service of the range extender is carried out at an unfavorable time, this can be stopped by pressing the 
START-STOP button. 

The following prerequisite must be satisfied so that the combustion engine is started: 

• State of charge of the high-voltage battery < 75% 

• Fuel tank content > 0.8 I 

• No fault code entry in the RDME control unit.

10. Service 


An intelligent service already starts in the vehicle. This is why the maintenance system Condition 
Based Service CBS is also used in the 101. The instrument cluster in the cockpit automatically 
provides information in advance about what servicing must be performed. 

So that the combustion engine cannot be easily started, it was necessary to develop special test 
operations for the service. 

In order to be able to perform an exhaust-gas test in vehicles with range extender, there is the option to 
start the combustion engine by following a sequence of certain activities. 

The "Service Start" was also developed for the diagnosis system, especially for troubleshooting at the 
vehicle. You find out more about this in the following sub chapters. 


10.1. Exhaust-gas test mode 

It is necessary to start the combustion engine for an exhaust-gas test in the BMW 101 with range 
extender. This is made possible by a certain operating sequence: 

• Tailgate is open 

• Switch on ignition and engage drive position "P" (without braking) 

• Press and hold down the accelerator pedal within 60 seconds 

• Press the brake three times within 20 seconds and hold 

• Release the accelerator pedal and press the START-STOP button when the brake is actuated 

• The combustion engine starts if the SOC of the high-voltage battery is less than 75 %. 

As a Check Control message the status "Exhaust-gas test mode activated" is output when the 
combustion engine is running. The empty run point is automatically approached during the warm-up 
phase. Using the pedal sensor position two speed points of the combustion engine are selected for 
the measurement. 

The "Exhaust-gas test" mode is automatically ended: 

• after 20 minutes 

• or at the start of the journey 

• or by switching off the ignition. 


10.2. Service Start 

The diagnosis system provides a variety of options to Service. In the diagnosis interface ISTA 
(Integrated Service Technical Application) it is possible to select the service function "Start range 
extender". The combustion engine in the BMW 101 can be started and stopped for diagnosis purposes 
via the diagnosis system. Another selection in the service function "Start range extender" is the 
activation of different speeds.

10.3. Maintenance work 

As the combustion engine in the BMW 101 is not permanently used, the servicing is reduced to a 
minimum. Engine oil with filter is only required after a time interval of 10,000 miles /12 months or 
depending on the operating hours of the combustion engine. The operating hours are recorded in the 
EDME control unit. 

A_ 

During an oil change care should be exercised to ensure no oil is spilled when filling. A suitable funnel 
must be used. The repair instructions must be followed. 

2.6 liters of oil is the capacity of the W20 engine.
