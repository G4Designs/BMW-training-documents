Power Supply 



KL30 - Battery Voltage: It supplies the operating voltage to the ECM. The ECM contains 
a “EEPROM” that will store data in the event of power loss (battery disconnected). 

KL15 - Ignition Switch: When the ignition is switched “on” the ECM is informed that the 
engine is about to be started. KL15 also supplies voltage to the Engine Control Module 
Relay. Switching KL15 “off” removes the ECM operating voltage. 

Engine Control Module Relay: It provides the operating voltage for: 

• ECM • Fuel Pump Relay 

• Fuel Injectors • Oxygen Sensor Heating 

• Idle Speed Valve • EGS (and ASC on E39) 

• Evaporative Emission Valve/Air Inlet Shut Off Valve • Hot Film Air Mass Sensor 

• Exhaust Flap Solenoid • Secondary Air Pump Relay 

• VANOS Solenoid • Secondary Air Injection Solenoid 

• Running Losses Solenoid 


Ground: Multiple ground paths are necessary to complete current flow through the ECM.

Principle of Operation 

Battery Voltage is monitored by the ECM for fluctuations. It will adjust the output func¬ 
tions to compensate for a lower (11,7v) and higher (14v) voltage value. For example, the 
ECM will: 


• Modify Pulse Width Duration of Fuel Injection 

• Modify Dwell Time of Ignition 


The E39 Power Supplies (KL15 and 
Relay) are fused to the MS41.1 ECM. 

The fuses are housed in the Engine Fuse 
located in the Electronics Box. 



When KL15 is switched “on” the ECM is ready for engine management. The ECM will acti¬ 
vate ground to energize the Engine Control Module Relay. The Engine Control Module 
Relay supplies operating voltage to the ECM and the previously mentioned operating com¬ 
ponents. 


When KL15 is switched “off” the ECM operating voltage is removed. The ECM will main¬ 
tain a ground to the Engine Control Module Relay for a few seconds. 


Ground is required to complete the current 
path through the ECM. The ECM also: 


• Internally links a constant ground (1) to the 
engine sensors. 

• Switches gound (2) to activate components.

Workshop Hints 

Power Supply - Testing 

Inadequate power and ground supply can result in: 

• No Start 

• Hard Starting (Long Crank Times) 

• Inaccurate Diagnostic Status or ECM 
Not Found 

• Intermittant/Constant “CHECK ENGINE” Light 

• Intermittant/Constant Driveability 
Problems 


Power supply including fuses should be tested for: 

• Visual (1) Blown Fuse 

• Available Voltage 2 

• Voltage Drop (Dynamic Resistance) (2) 

• Resistance of Cables and Wires (2) 


The ignition (KL15) must be switched off when 
removing or installing the ECM connector to 
prevent voltage spikes (arcing) that can damage 
the Control Module! 




The Engine Control Module Relay (E36 located in the fuse box, 
Z3/E39 in the Electronics Box) should be tested for: 

• Battery Voltage and Switch Ground (1) 

• Resistance (1) 

• Battery Voltage and Voltage Drop (2)

Tools and Equipment 

Power Supply 

When testing power supply to an ECM, the DIS/MoDIC multi¬ 
meter function as well as a reputable hand held multimeter 
can be used. 

It is best to make the checks at the ECM connection, this 
method includes testing the wiring harness. 



E36 


The correct Universal Adapter for the MS41 .X application 
should be used (#88 88 6 614 410). This will ensure the pin 
connectors and the harness will not be damaged. 

The interior of this Universal Adapter is shielded, therefore it is 
vital that the ground cable is connected to the vehicle chassis 
whenever the adapter is used. 

The adapter uses a Printed Circuit board inside keeping the 
capacitive and inductive load to a minimum. 



1P550007.bmp 


E39 (1)= ECM 


When installing the Universal Adapter to the ECM (E36 locat¬ 
ed below the windshield on the passenger side of the engine 
compartment, Z3/E39 in the Electronics Box), make sure the 
ignition is switched off. 




The Engine Control Module Relay should be tested using the 
relay test kit (P/N 88 88 6 613 010) shown on the right. 

This kit allows testing of relays from a remote position. 

Always consult the ETM for proper relay connections.

Air Management 



Throttle Valve: The mechanical throttle valve 
regulates the intake air flow and it is linked by a 
cable to the accelerator pedal. 

The throttle housing is secured to the intake 
manifold by four bolts (arrows). 

The throttle valve is heated by engine coolant to 
prevent condensation from “icing”. The throttle 
valve is “preset” and should not be adjusted. 


Throttle Position Sensor: A potentiometer is 
mounted on the throttle housing which provides 
the ECM with a voltage value (0-5v) that repre¬ 
sents throttle angle position and rate of move¬ 
ment. The sensor receives its power supply 
from the ECM. 

The Potentiometer is non-adjustable because 
the ECM “learns” the throttle angle voltage at 
idle speed. If the throttle position sensor is 
replaced, the adaptations must be cleared using 
the DIS/MoDIC. 

If this input is defective, a fault code will be 
stored and the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will be 
illuminated when the OBD II criteria is achieved. 
The ECM will still operate the engine using the 
Hot-Film Air Mass Meter and Engine RPM 
inputs.

Idle Speed Control Valve: This valve regulates air by¬ 
passing the throttle valve to control the engine idle 
speed. 

The valve is supplied with battery voltage from the 
ECM Relay. The Idle Air Actuator is a two-coil rotary 
actuator. The ECM is equipped with two final stage 
transistors which will alternate positioning of the actu¬ 
ator. 

The final stages are "pulsed" simultaneously by the 
ECM which provides ground paths for the actuator. 
The duty cycle of each circuit is varied to achieve the 
required idle RPM. 

If this component/circuits are defective, a fault code 
will be set and the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illu¬ 
minated when the OBD II criteria is achieved. 


Hot-Film Air Mass Meter (HFM): The air volume 
input signal is produced electronically by the HFM 
which uses a heated metal film (180° C above intake 
air temperature) in the air flow stream. 

The ECM Relay provides the operating voltage. As air 
flows through the HFM, the film is cooled changing the 
resistance which affects current flow through the cir¬ 
cuit. The sensor produces a 1-5 volt varying signal. 
Based on this change the ECM monitors and regulates 
the amount of fuel injected. 

If this input is defective, a fault code will be set and the 
“CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illuminated when the 
OBD II criteria is achieved. The ECM will operate the 
engine using the Throttle Position and Engine RPM 
inputs.

Air Temperature Signal: This signal is needed 
by the ECM to correct the air volume input for 
changes in the intake air temperature. The sen¬ 
sor is located in the intake manifold behind the 
throttle housing. 

The ECM provides the power supply to this 
component. The sensor decreases in resistance 
as the temperature rises and vice versa (NTC). 
The ECM monitors the applied voltage (5v), as 
air temperature changes the resistance value 
the voltage signal will vary (0-5v). 



13550009.eps 


If this input is defective, a fault code will be set and the 
“CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illuminated when the 
OBD II criteria is achieved. The ECM will operate the 
engine using the Engine Coolant Sensor input. 


Pressure Control Valve: The pressure control valve 
varies the vacuum applied to the crankcase ventilation 
depending on engine load. The valve is balanced 
between spring pressure and the amount of manifold 
vacuum. 

The oil vapors exit the separator labyrinth (2) in the 
cylinder head cover (1). The oil vapors are drawn into 
the cyclone type liquid/vapor separator (3) regulated by 
the pressure control valve (5). The collected oil will drain 
back into the oil pan (4). 

At idle when the intake manifold vacuum is high, the 
vacuum reduces the valve opening allowing a small 
amount of crankcase vapors to be drawn into the 
intake manifold. At part to full load conditions when in¬ 
take manifold vacuum is lower, the spring opens the 
valve and additional crankcase vapors are drawn into 
the intake manifold.

Principle of Operation 

Air flow into the engine is regulated by the Throttle Valve or the Idle Speed Control Valve. 
Both of these air “passages” are necessary for smooth engine operation from idle to full 
load. On the MS41.X system, the Throttle Valve is mechanically controlled and the Idle 
Speed Control Valve is electrically controlled. All of the ECM monitoring, processing and 
output functions are a result of regulated air flow. 



The Throttle Position Sensor is monitored by the ECM for throttle angle position and rate 
of movement. As the throttle plate is opened, a rising voltage signal (up to 5v) requests 
acceleration and at what rate. The ECM will increase the volume of fuel injected into the 
engine, advance the ignition timing and decrease the Idle Speed Valve opening (air is now 
going by the throttle plate). The “full throttle” position indicates maximum acceleration to 
the ECM and in addition to the functions just mentioned, this will have an effect on the 
airconditioning compressor (covered in Performance Controls). 

As the throttle plate is closed (integral springs), a decrease in voltage signals the ECM to 
activate fuel shut off if the rpm is above idle speed (coasting). The Idle Speed Control Valve 
will then be opened to maintain idle speed. 

The ECM monitors the engine idle speed in addition the Throttle Position Sensor voltage. 
The voltage value is “learned” at the correct idle speed and if the voltage value has changed 
(mechanical wear of throttle plate or linkage), the ECM will adjust the Idle Speed Control 
Valve to maintain the correct idle speed based on the “new” voltage (the adaptations must 
be cleared using the DIS/MoDIC). If the Throttle Position input is defective, a fault code will 
be set and the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will illuminate when the OBD II criteria is achieved. 
The ECM will maintain engine operation based on the Hot-Film Air Mass Sensor and the 
Engine RPM Sensor. 

The Idle Speed Control Valve is controlled by the ECM modulating the ground circuits to 
the two windings for opening and closing. By varying the duty cycle applied to the wind¬ 
ings, the valve can be progressively opened or held steady to maintain the idle speed. If the 
Idle Speed Control Valve circuit is defective, a fault code will be set and the “CHECK 
ENGINE” Light will illuminate when the OBD II criteria is achieved. 


13 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Air Management 








There are additional factors that influence the ECM in regulating idle speed: 


• The Rpm sensor input allows the ECM to 
monitor engine speed because of loads that 
cause idle fluctuations due to drag on the 
engine: power steering, thick oil 

(friction forces), etc. 

• Cold engine temperature (coolant NTC) 
provides higher idle speed to raise temperature 
sooner. 

• Vehicle speed informs ECM when the vehicle 
is stationary and requires idle maintenance. 

• A/C on request from the climate control system 
(arming the ECM) and compressor engage 
(stabilize idle speed) acknowledgment. 

• Range selector provides a Park/Neutral input 
to the ECM identifying when the vehicle is in 

a drive gear. This signal allows idle stabilizaton 
for the increased load on the engine. 



The Hot-Film Air Mass Sensor sends a varying voltage (0-5v) to the ECM representing 
the measured amount of intake air volume. This input is used by the ECM to determine the 
amount of fuel to be injected. If this input is defective, a fault code will be set and the 
“CHECK ENGINE” Light will illuminate when the OBD II criteria is achieved. The ECM will 
maintain engine operation based on the Throttle Position Sensor and Engine Speed 
Sensor. 


The Air Temperature Signal allows the ECM to make a calculation of intake air tempera¬ 
ture. The varying voltage input from the NTC sensor indicates the larger proportion of oxy¬ 
gen found in cold air, as compared to less oxygen found in warmer air. The ECM will adjust 
the amount of injected fuel because the quality of combustion depends on oxygen sensing 
ratio. 

The ignition timing is also affected by air temperature. If the intake air is hot the ECM retards 
the base ignition timing to reduce the risk of detonation. If the intake air is cooler, the base 
ignition timing will be advanced. If this input is defective, a fault code will be set and the 
“CHECK ENGINE” Light will illuminate when the OBD II criteria is achieved.

Workshop Hints 

Air Management 

Unmetered air leaks can be misleading when diagnosing faults causing Check Engine 
Light/driveability complaints. Refer to S.l. #11 03 92 (3500) for testing intake vacuum leaks. 


Crankcase Ventilation System 

A fault in this system can often “mislead” diagnosis. This type of fault can produce: 

• Mixture/Misfire Defect Codes 

• Whistling Noises 

• Performance/Driveabiltity Complaints 


Please refer to the following Service Information Bulletins for details on the Crankcase 
Ventilation System: 

• Crankcase Ventilation System Check S.l. #11 05 98 


Throttle Valve and Throttle Position Sensor 


These components are non-adjustable and tampering is not permitted. However, the 
attaching throttle and cruise control cables should be adjusted (refer to Repair Instru¬ 
ctions).

Throttle Position Sensor - Testing 


The Throttle Position Sensor (potetiometer) can 
be tested with the following methods: 


• DIS Status Page (approx. 0.6v idle to 4.2v full 
throttle) 

• DIS Oscilloscope - Select from the Preset 
Measurements which requires taking the 
measurements with the ECM and Universal 
Adapter with the ECM disconnected, 
(approx. 1-4 k ohms). 

• Resistance check of the entire circuit, using 
the Universal Adapter with the ECM 
disconnected (approx. 1-4 k ohms). 



Idle Speed Control Valve - Testing 


• The Idle Speed Control Valve and idle air 
circuit (passage ways) should be checked for 
physical obstructions. Visually inspect the 
sealing gasket (1), mounting (2) and air hose 
clamps (3). 

• The resistance of the valve winding should be 
checked. 

• The ECM output and Idle Speed Control Valve 
operation can be tested by “Component 
Activation” on the DIS/MoDIC. 

• The Pulse Width Modulated ground outputs 
from the ECM can be tested using the DIS/ 
MoDIC Oscilloscope. 

• Consult Technical Data for specified idle speed. 


NOTE: If the valve is blocked or contaminated, 
An HFM fault code will also be present!

Air Temperature Signal - Testing 


NTC sensors decrease in resistance as the temperature rises and vice versa. The ECM 
monitors the sensor voltage which varies as temperature changes the resistance value. For 
example, as temperature rises: 


• Resistance through the sensor 
decreases. 


• Voltage drop across the sensor 
decreases. 


Input signal voltage also 
decreases (5 - Ov)

Fuel Management 


12550004.eps 



Fuel Tank: The fuel tank is made of 
high density polyethylene (reduced 
weight) which is manufactured to 
meet safety requirements. 

A mid-chassis mounted “saddle” type 
tank is used (E36/ E39) which pro¬ 
vides a tunnel for the driveshaft but 
creates two separate low spots in the 
tank. 

A Syphon jet is required with this type 
of tank to transfer fuel from the left 
side, linked to the fuel return line. 

As fuel moves through the return, the 
siphon jet creates a low pressure (suc¬ 
tion) to pick up fuel from the left side 
of the tank and transfer it to the right 
side at the fuel pick up. 


The Z3 uses a conventional type fuel 
tank that is mounted between the 
seats and the luggage compartment. 
The Z3 has a single sending unit that 
(with the fuel pump) is accessed from 
behind the passenger seat.

Fuel Pump: The electric fuel pump supplies constant 
fuel volume to the injection system. This system uses a 
single submersable (in the fuel tank) pump. The inlet is 
protected by a mesh screen. 

When the fuel pump is powered, the armature will 
rotate the impeller disc creating low pressure at the 
inlet. The fuel will be drawn into the inlet and passed 
through the fuel pump housing (around the armature). 

The fuel lubricates and cools the internals of the pump 
motor. 

The fuel will exit through a non-return check valve to 
supply the injection system. The non-return check valve 
is opened by fuel exiting the pump and will close when 
the pump is deactivated. This maintains a “prime” of 
fuel in the filter, lines, hoses and fuel rail. 

The pump contains an internal overpressure relief valve 
that will open (reducing roller cell pressure) if there is a 
restriction in the fuel supply hardware. 

Fuel Supply Components: The fuel is transfered from 
the fuel pump to the fuel filter. The fuel filter “traps” con- 
taminents before they reach the fuel injectors and 
should be replaced at the specified interval. The arrow 
on the filter denotes the installation direction (under the 
driver side floor). The large filter size also serves as a 
volume reservoir for pressurized fuel (dampening fuel 
pump pulsations). 

Running Losses refers to the fuel vapors that 
can escape to the atmosphere during vehicle 
operation. The fuel pump delivers more volume 
than the injection system requires. The unused 
fuel is routed through a return line to the tank at 
the fuel pressure regulator integrated in the 
Running Losses 3/2 Way Valve under the driver 
side floor. The fuel is constantly circulated in this 
manner. 

Using the by-pass type regulator reduces the 
returned fuel temperature to the tank. 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 






13550Q56.eps 

























Running Losses Fuel Supply: The ECM controls the operation of the Running Losses 
Fuel Circuit by activating the by-pass solenoid. The solenoid is energized for 20 seconds 
on engine start up to supply full fuel volume to the fuel rail. After 20 seconds, the solenoid 
is deactivated and sprung closed (the by-pass is opened). This reduces the amount of fuel 
circulating through the fuel rail and diverts the excess to return through the fuel pressure 
regulator. 

The fuel injectors are provided with regulated fuel for injection but the returned fuel by-pass- 
es the engine compartment fuel rail thus lowering the temperature and amount of vapor¬ 
ization that takes place in the fuel tank. 

The solenoid is also activated momentarily if an engine misfire is detected. This function 
provides full fuel flow through the fuel rail to determine if the misfire was caused by a lean 
fuel condition. The solenoid is monitored by the ECM for faults.

Fuel Pressure Regulator: The Fuel Pressure Reg¬ 
ulator maintains a constant “pressure differential" for 
the fuel injectors. 

The fuel pressure is set to 3.5 bar (+/- 0.2) by internal 
spring tension on the restriction valve. 

The vacuum chamber is sealed off by a diaphragm 
which is connected by a hose to the intake manifold. 
Intake manifold vacuum regulates the fuel pressure by 
assisting to compress the spring (lowering fuel pressure). 

When the restriction valve opens, unused fuel returns 
back to the fuel tank. 



Examples of “pressure differential” are: 

• At low to part throttle, intake manifold vacuum is available at the tip of the fuel injectors 
to enhance fuel “flow through”. Vacuum is also applied to the fuel pressure regulator vac¬ 
uum chamber, causing the diaphragm to compress the spring which opens the restric¬ 
tion valve. This lowers the fuel pressure available to the fuel injectors. 














































































• Wide open throttle depletes intake manifold vacuum at the tip of the fuel injectors and in 
the fuel pressure regulator vacuum chamber. The spring closes the restriction valve to 
raise fuel pressure available to the fuel injectors. This maintains pressure differential (fuel 
flow through) for the fuel injectors. 



By maintaining constant Fuel Pressure Differential through vacuum sensing (engine load), 
the ECM can then regulate volume and mixture by the length of time the injectors are open 
(duration). 


The fuel rail distributes an even supply of fuel to 
all of the injectors, and also serves as a volume 
reservoir. The fuel rail is secured by bolts to the 
intake manifold.

Bosch Fuel Injectors: The Fuel Injectors are electronically controlled solenoid valves that 
provide precise metered and atomized fuel into the engine intake ports. The Fuel Injector 
Valve consists of: l- 


1 . 

Fuel Strainer 

2. 

Electrical Connector 

3. 

Solenoid Winding 

4. 

Closing Spring 

5. 

Solenoid Armature 

6. 

Needle Valve 

7. 

Pintle 


Fuel is supplied from the fuel rail to the injector body. 
The fuel is channeled through the injector body to the 
needle valve and seat at the tip of the injector. 

Without electrical current, the needle valve is sprung 
closed against the seat. 

The Fuel Injectors receive voltage from the Engine 
Control Module Relay. The ECM activates current flow 
through the injector solenoid creating a magnetic field 
that pulls the needle “up” off of its seat. 

The pressurized fuel flows through the opening and 
deflects off of the pintle. 



The pintle (tip of the needle) is a cone shaped deflec¬ 
tor that “fans out” the fuel spray into an angled pattern 
which helps to atomize the fuel. 

When the ECM deactivates current flow, the needle 
valve is sprung closed against the seat and fuel flow 
through the injector is stopped. 

The length of time that the ECM activates the Fuel 
Injectors is very brief, the duration is in milli-seconds 
(ms). This affects the mount of fuel volume flowing 
through the Fuel Injectors. 


13550075.jpg 



The ECM will vary the length of time (ms) to regulate 
the air/fuel ratio (mixture). 


25 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 







































































The Fuel Injectors are mounted in rubber “o- 
rings” between the fuel rail and the intake man¬ 
ifold to insulate them from heat and vibration. 

This insulation also reduces the injector noise 
from being transmitted through the engine 
compartment. The Fuel Injectors are held to the 
fuel rail by securing clips (arrow). 

If a Fuel Injector is faulty (mechanical or electri¬ 
cal), it can produce the following complaints: 

• “CHECK ENGINE” Light • Misfire/Rough Idle (Leaking or Blocked) 

• Excessive Tailpipe Smoke (Leaking) • Long Crank Time (Leaking) 

• Engine Hydrolock (Leaking) 

• Oxygen Sensor/Mixture/Injector Related Fault Codes 



Crankshaft Position/RPM Sensor (Hall Effect): This sensor provides the crankshaft 
position and engine speed (RPM) signal to the ECM for Fuel Pump and Injector operation. 

A Hall sensor is mounted on the left side at the 
rear of the engine block. The impulse wheel is 
mounted on the crankshaft inside the crank¬ 
case, at the rear main bearing support. The 
impulse wheel contains 58 teeth with a gap of 
two missing teeth. 


The Hall sensor is supplied with voltage from 
the ECM. A digital square wave signal is pro¬ 
duced by the sensor as the teeth of the impulse 
wheel pass by. The “gap” allows the ECM to 
establish crankshaft position. 


The crankshaft position sensor is monitored as part of OBD II requirements for Misfire 
Detection. If this input is faulty, the ECM will operate the engine (limited driveability) from the 
Camshaft Sensor input. A fault with this input will produce the following complaints: 

• Hard Starting/Long Crank Time 

• Driveability/Misfire/Engine Stalling 

• ’’CHECK ENGINE” Light

Cylinder Identification Signal: An angle pulse gen¬ 
erator is used for the camshaft position sensing. The 
MS41 .X ECM uses the signal from the camshaft sen¬ 
sor to set up the fully sequential fuel injection. 

This sensor consists of two windings (primary and sec¬ 
ondary) that are connected together at one end, and a 
magnetic core. 

The primary winding is supplied with a 120 kHz AC sig¬ 
nal. The magnetic coupling causes an induced voltage 
into the secondary winding (at the same frequency). 
However the induced voltage has a slight phase shift 
due to the induction time delay. 



The trigger wheel of the camshaft influences the magnet field of the sensor and causes the 
phase shift to increase as the disc of the wheel moves closer to the sensor. The ECM mon¬ 
itors this change in phase shift as “TDC” (compression input) from the camshaft. 

When the disc passes by the sensor the phase shift moves closer again. 


If this input is defective, the system will still operate based on the Crankshaft Position/RPM 
Sensor. A fault will be set and the ECM will activate the injectors in parallel. The camshaft 
position sensor is monitored as part of the requirements for OBD II.

Engine Coolant Temperature: The Engine 
Coolant Temperature is provided to the ECM 
from an NTC type sensor located in the coolant 
jacket of the cylinder head. The sensor contains 
two NTC elements, the other sensor is used for 
the instrument cluster temperature gauge. 



The ECM determines the correct air/fuel mixture 
required for the engine temperature by monitor¬ 
ing an applied voltage to the sensor (5v). This 
voltage will vary (0-5v) as coolant temperature 
changes the resistance value. 



If the Coolant Temperature Sensor input is faulty, a fault 
code will be set the ECM will assume a substitute value 
(80° C) to maintain engine operation. 

Throttle Position Sensor: The potentiometer is mon¬ 
itored by the ECM for throttle angle position and rate of 
movement. For details about the sensor, refer to the Air 
Management section. 

As the throttle is opened, the ECM will increase the vol¬ 
ume of fuel injected into the engine. As the throttle plate 
is closed, the ECM activates fuel shut off if the rpm is 
above idle speed (coasting). 

If the Throttle Position input is defective, a fault code 
will be set. The ECM will maintain fuel injection opera¬ 
tion based on the Air Flow Volume Sensor and the 
Crankshaft Position/RPM Sensor. 

Hot-Film Air Mass Meter (HFM): The air volume 
input signal is used by the ECM to determine the 
amount of fuel to be injected for correct air/fuel ratio. 
For details about the sensor, refer to the Air 
Management section. 

If this input is defective, a fault code will be set and the 
ECM will operate the engine using the Throttle Position 
and Engine RPM inputs.

Air Temperature: This signal allows the ECM to 
make a calculation of air density. For details 
about the sensor, refer to the Air Management 
section. 

The varying voltage input from the NTC sensor 
indicates the larger proportion of oxygen found 
in cold air, as compared to less oxygen found in 
warmer air. The ECM will adjust the amount of 
injected fuel because the quality of combustion 
depends on oxygen sensing ratio. 

If this input is defective, a fault code will be set 
and the ECM will operate the engine using the 
Engine Coolant Sensor input.

Principle of Operation 

Fuel Management delivers fuel from the tank to the intake ports of the engine. To accom¬ 
plish this, fuel supply must be available to the fuel injectors. Then the fuel must be inject¬ 
ed in the precise amount and at the correct time. The ECM does not directly monitor fuel 
supply, although it does control fuel supply. The Fuel Pump supplies fuel when it receives 
operating voltage from the Engine Control Module Relay supplying the Fuel Pump Relay. 
The ECM controls and monitors fuel injection. 



The Fuel Injectors will be opened by the ECM to inject pressurized fuel into the intake 
ports. The Fuel Injectors receive voltage from the Engine Control Module Relay. The ECM 
controls the opening by activating the ground circuits for the Solenoid Windings. The ECM 
will vary the duration (in milli-seconds) of “opening” time to regulate the air/fuel ratio. 


30 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 


























































































The ECM has six Final Stage output transistors 
that switch ground to the six injector solenoids. 
The Injector “triggering” is first established from 
the Crankshaft Position/RPM Sensor. 


The ECM is programmed to activate the Final 
Stage output transistors once for every two rev¬ 
olutions of the crankshaft in two groups (Semi- 
Sequential Injection). 

The injectors are opened in two groups for every 



complete “working cycle” of the engine. This 
delivers the fuel charge for cylinders 1,5,3 dur¬ 
ing one revolution of the crankshaft and cylin¬ 
ders 6,2,4 during the second revolution of the 
crankshaft. This process enhances fuel atom¬ 
ization during start up. 

During start up, the ECM recognizes the 
Camshaft Position (Cylinder ID) input. The 
camshaft position is referenced to the crank¬ 
shaft position. It then switches the injection to 
Full Sequential. This process “times” the injec¬ 



tion closer to the intake valve opening for 


increased efficiency. 

When activated, each injector delivers the full 
fuel charge at separate times during each 
engine working cycle. 

If this input is faulty, the ECM will activate the 
injectors in Parallel to maintain engine operation 
and set a fault code. 



31 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 





The Injector “open” Time to maintain engine operation after it has been started is det¬ 
ermined by the ECM (programming). The ECM will calculate the engine “timing” based on 
a combination of the following inputs: 


• Battery Voltage 

• Throttle Position 

• Air Flow Volume/Mass 

• Air Temperature 

• Crankshaft Position/RPM 

• Camshaft Position (Cylinder ID) 

• Engine Coolant 

• Oxygen Sensor 
(Detail in Emissions) 



The injection ms value will be regulated based on battery voltage. When cranking, the volt¬ 
age is low and the ECM will increase the ms value to compensate for injector “lag time”. 
When the engine is running and the battery voltage is higher, the ECM will decrease the 
injection ms value due to faster injector reaction time. 

Cold starting requires additional fuel to compensate for poor mixture and the loss of fuel as 
it condenses onto cold intake ports, valves and cylinder walls. The cold start fuel quantity 
is determined by the ECM based on the Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor input during 
start up. 

During cranking, additional fuel is injected (in Semi-Sequential) for the first few crankshaft 
revolutions. After the first few crankshaft revolutions, the injected quantity is metered down 
as the engine comes up to speed. When the engine speed approaches idle rpm, the ECM 
recognizes the Camshaft Position and switches to Full Sequential injection. 

When the engine is cold, optimum fuel metering is not possible due to poor air/fuel mixing 
and an enriched mixture is required. The Coolant Temperature input allows the ECM to 
adjust the injection ms value to compensate during warm up and minimize the the inject¬ 
ed fuel at engine operating temperature. 

32 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 

















































When the engine is at idle, minimum injection is required. Additional fuel will be added if the 
ECM observes low engine rpm and increasing throttle/air volume inputs (acceleration 
enrichment). As the throttle is opened, the ECM monitors acceleration and rate of move¬ 
ment. The ECM will increase the volume of fuel injected into the engine by increasing the 
injection ms value. The “full throttle” position indicates maximum acceleration and the ECM 
will add more fuel (full load enrichment). 

As the throttle is closed, the ECM decreases the injection ms value (fuel shut off) if the rpm 
is above idle speed (coasting). This feature decreases fuel consumption and lowers emis¬ 
sions. When the engine rpm approaches idle speed, the injection ms value is increased 
(cut-in) to prevent the engine from stalling. The cut-in rpm is dependent upon the engine 
temperature and the rate of deceleration. 

The Hot-Film Air Mass (HFM) signal provides the measured amount of intake air vol¬ 
ume/mass. This input is used by the ECM to determine the amount of fuel to be injected 
to “balance” the air/fuel ratio. 

The Air Temperature Signal allows the ECM to make an additional calculation of air densi¬ 
ty. The varying voltage input from the NTC sensor indicates the larger proportion of oxygen 
found in cold air, as compared to less oxygen found in warmer air. The ECM will adjust the 
amount of injected fuel because the quality of combustion depends on oxygen sensing 
ratio (details in Emissions). 

The Crankshaft Position/RPM signals the ECM to start injection as well as providing infor¬ 
mation about the engine operation. This input is used in combination with other inputs to 
determine engine load which increases/decreases the injection ms value. Without this in¬ 
put, the ECM will not activate the injectors. 

The Camshaft Postion (Cylinder ID) affects the injection timing (Semi-Sequential/Full 
Sequential). To accomplish this, the ECM contains six Final Stage output transistors that 
activate the injectors individually. The engine operates sufficiently on Semi-Sequential 
Injection (two groups of three), but more efficiently on Full Sequential Injection (six individ¬ 
ual). If one of the fuel injector circuits faulted, the engine can still operate on limited power 
from the other remaining fuel injector circuits. 


33 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 



Injection “Reduction” Time is required to 
control fuel economy, emissions, engine and 
vehicle speed limitation. The ECM will “trim” 
back or deactivate the fuel injection as neces¬ 
sary while maintaining optimum engine opera¬ 
tion. 

As the throttle is closed during deceleration, the 
ECM decreases the injection ms value (fuel shut 
off) if the rpm is above idle speed (coasting). 
This feature decreases fuel consumption and 
lowers emissions.

When the engine rpm approaches idle speed, the injec¬ 
tion ms value is increased (cut-in) to prevent the engine 
from stalling. The cut-in rpm is dependent upon the 
engine temperature and the rate of deceleration. This 
function can be observed as displayed on the Fuel 
Economy (MPG) gauge. 

The ECM will selectively deactivate injectors to control 
maximum engine rpm (regardless of vehicle speed). 
When the engine speed reaches 6500 rpm (7600 rpm 
M3), the injectors will be individually deactvated as 
required to protect the engine from over-rev. As the 
engine speed drops below 6500 (7600 M3) rpm, injec¬ 
tor activation will be resumed. This feature does not 
protect the engine from a forced over-rev such as 
improperly downshifting a manual transmission 
equipped vehicle (driver error). 



Maximum vehicle speed is also limited by the 
ECM selectively deactivating the injectors 
(regardless of engine rpm). 

This limitation is based on the vehicle dimen¬ 
sions, specifications and installed tires (speed 
rating). 



34 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 




























































The ECM will also protect the 
Catalytic Converter by deactivat¬ 
ing the injectors. 

If the ECM detects a “misfire” 
(ignition, injection or combustion) 
it can selectively deactivate the 
Final Stage output transistor for 
that cylinder(s). 

The injector(s) will not open, pre¬ 
venting unburned fuel from enter¬ 
ing the exhaust system. 

On the MS41 .X system, there are 
six individual injector circuits 
resulting in deactivation of one or 
multiples. This will limit engine 
power, but protect the Catalytic 
Converter.

Fuel Injection Control Monitoring is performed by the ECM for OBD II requirements. 
Faults with the fuel injectors and/or control circuits will be stored in memory. This monitor¬ 
ing includes: 


• Closed Loop Operation 

• Oxygen Sensor Feedback 

These additional corrections are factored into 
the calculated injection time. If the correction 
factor exceeds set limits a fault will be stored in 
memory. 

When the criteria for OBD II monitoring is ach¬ 
ieved, the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illumi¬

Workshop Hints 

Before any service work is performed on any fuel system related component, 
always adhere to the following: 

• Observe relevent safety legislation pertaining to your area. 

• Ensure adequate ventilation. 

• Use exhaust extraction system where applicable (alleviate fumes). 

• DO NOT OPERATE THE FUEL PUMP unless it is properly installed in the fuel tank 
and is submersed in the fuel (fuel lubricates the pump). 

• DO NOT SMOKE while performing fuel system repairs. 

• Always wear adequate protection clothing including eye protection. 

• Use caution when working around a HOT engine compartment. 

• During fuel system repairs that involve “sealing rings”, always replace them with new 
COPPER sealing rings only. 

• BMW does not recommend any UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATIONS to the fuel system. 
The Fuel systems are designed to comply with strict federal safety and emissions regulations. 
In the concern of product liability, it is unauthorized to sell or perform modifications to 
customers vehicles, particularly in safety related areas. 

• Always consult the Repair Instructions on the specific model you are working on before 
attempting a repair. 


Fuel 

Fuel quality should always be considered when diagnosing a driveability complaint. The 
type of fuel, proper AKI rating, impurities and moisture are not factored by the ECM. 

Please refer to the Owner’s Manual and following Service Information Bulletins regarding 
fuel: 

• Gasoline Fuel Quality S.l. #13 01 88 (1564) • Gasoline Additive S.l. #13 04 88 (1591) 


36 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 


















Fuel Supply 


The fuel supply hardware should be visually inspected for damage that can affect pick-up, 
transfer, pressure and return. Please refer to the Repair Instructions and the following 
Service Information Bulletins details on fuel supply hardware: 

• Fuel System Modifications S.l. #16 01 81 

• Reposition Fuel Line - Z3 with M52 Engine S.l. #16 03 97 


Fuel Pump and Sending Unit Access 

All BMW vehicles have access plates to service 
the fuel pump and sending unit(s) without 
removing the fuel tank. 


The E36/E39 access plates are located under 
the rear seat. The “saddle” type fuel tank (under 
rear seat) has two access plates. 



The passenger side allows access to the fuel 
pump/sending unit. The driver side allows 
access to the sending unit. 



The Z3 has a single access plate located behind the pas¬ 
senger seat. 



ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 































Draining the Fuel Tank 

In order to remove the fuel tank it must be drained first 
to avoid fuel spills and handling excessive weight. In 
some cases depending on the fuel tank dimensions 
(vehicle specific), it is also necessary to drain the fuel 
tank to replace the sending units and/or fuel pump. 



CAUTION: In some vehicles, the sending units/fuel 
pump is mounted lower than the top of the fuel tank. 

A fuel spill will be encountered if the fuel is not drained. 

NOTE: Consult the BMW Service Workshop Equip¬ 
ment for the proper evacuation equipment. 

The saddle type tank requires an additional step to 
drain the fuel from the driver side. The evacuation 
equipment should be attached to the tank compensat¬ 
ing hose (arrow) to drain out the remaining fuel. 


Fuel Pump/Pressure Regulator - Testing 

The fuel pump should be tested for delivery pressure 
and volume. Caution when disconnecting fuel hoses 
because there is the possibility of residual fuel pres¬ 
sure! Install the fuel pressure gage between the fuel fil¬ 
ter and and pressure regulator. 

Remove the fuel pump relay (located in the Electronics 
Box E36/Z3, and right side of the trunk E39 - see relay 
testing in the power supply section) and connect the 
Relay Bypass Switch to pin 87b and 30 of the relay 
socket. This will activate the fuel pump without running 
the engine. 

If the 3.5 bar fuel pressure is not achieved or bleed off 
is more than 0.5 bar, refer to 13 31 of the Repair 
instructions for further diagnosis. The Fuel Hose 
Clamp Tool can be used to isolate bleed off from the 
pump (non-return check valve) or the pressure regula¬ 
tor (restriction valve). Also verify power supply to the 
fuel pump. 



13550015.eps 



38 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 




Fuel volume must be tested to verify: 

• Fuel Pump Output 

• Restriction are not present in the pump pickup 
lines/hoses and fuel filter 



13550029.jpg 


Fuel Injectors 

When inspecting the fuel injectors, consider the 
following: 

• O-rings should be replaced, lubricated with 
vaseline or SAE 90 gear oil for installation 

• Verify the code number 

• Plastic spacer washer is not damaged 

• Color code of nozzle housing 

• Color code injector housing 




Fuel injectors can leak which bleeds off fuel 
pressure and increases emissions. The injectors 
can be tested using the Fuel Injector Leakage 
Tester. 

The fuel injectors can be cleaned, refer to 
Service Information Bulletin S.l. #04 07 86. 



39 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Fuel Management 


















The Fuel Injectors should also be tested using the DIS/MoDIC for: 


• Resistance 

• Power Supply 

• Status Display - Fuel Injection Signal 

(approximate 3.5 - 5 ms) 

• ECM Final Stage transistor activation. This test 

function is found under the Oscilloscope 
Preset list - “Ti Injection Signal”. Install the 
88 pin adapter, Diagnostic cable, MFK 2 
negative lead to ECM ground and MFK 2 
positive lead to the ground activation cicuit 
for the injector. This test is performed with 
the engine running.

Tools and Equipment 


The DIS/Modic as well as a reputable hand held 
multimeter can be used when testing inputs/ 
components. 

It is best to make the checks at the ECM con¬ 
nection, this method includes testing the wiring 
harness. 

The correct Universal Adapter for the MS41 .X 
application should be used (#88 88 6 614 410). 
This will ensure the pin connectors and the har¬ 
ness will not be damaged. 

The interior of this Universal Adapter is shielded, 
therefore it is vital that the ground cable is con¬ 
nected to the vehicle chassis whenever the 
adapter is used. 

The adapter uses a Printed Circuit board inside 
keeping the capacitive and inductive load to a 
minimum. 

When installing the Universal Adapter to the 
ECM (located below the windshield on the pas¬ 
senger side of the engine compartment), make 
sure the ignition is switched off. 





The Fuel Hose Clamp Tool (#13 3 010) can be 
used for isolating pressure faults. In addition, 
fuel loss can be reduced when changing the 
fuel filter while losening clamps (1 and 2). 

The Relay Bypass Switch (#61 3 050) must be 
used especially when fuel vapors are pre¬ 
sent! The switch eliminates the risk of electrical 
arcing.

When testing fuel pressure, the hand held fuel pressure 
gage (#13 3 060) can be used. 

Caution: Residual fuel pressure may be present! 

The DIS is equipped with a pressure measuring func¬ 
tion, found in Measurement testing. The following 
adapters (Special Tool numbers) will be necessary: 

• #13 6 051 • #13 6 055 • #13 6 057 


These adapters install “in line” in the fuel pressure 
hose. 




13550021 .eps 


For vehicles equipped with “quick-release” couplings, 
install special tool (#13 5 270) between the fuel filter (1) 
and pressure supply hose (2). This tool will couple to 
the DIS Pressure Adapter (3). 


Later production fuel rails are equipped with a thread¬ 
ed adapter fitting (1). 


This threaded adapter fitting allows Adapter #13 5 220 
to be threaded on to the fuel rail and coupled to the 
DIS Pressure Adapter.

When testing the fuel injectors for leakage, use Special Tool #88 88 5 000 362. Leak test¬ 
ing the fuel injectors is one of the diagnostic steps listed in “Long Cranking Times” S.l. #13 
08 90 (3096). This tool pressurizes the injectors with air and the injector tips are submersed 
in water. If air bubles are present, this indicates the leaking injector(s).

Ignition Management 


13550020.eps 



IGNITION COIL 
POWER RELAY 
(>1-97) 


Ignition Coils: The high voltage supply required to ignite the mixture in the combustion 
chambers is determined by the stored energy in the ignition coils. The stored energy con¬ 
tributes to the ignition duration, ignition current and rate of high voltage increase. The Coil 
circuit including primary and secondary components consists of: 


1. Coil Assembly 

• Primary Winding 

• Secondary Winding 

2. Resistor (Boot Connector) 

3. Spark Plug 

4. ECM Final Stage Transistor 

5. Secondary Coil Ground with 235 ohm 
resistor 




12550011 .eps 

The Coil Assembly contains two copper windings insulated from each other. One winding 
is the primary winding, formed by a few turns of thick wire. The secondary winding is 
formed by a great many turns of thin wire. 


The primary winding receives battery voltage from the ignition switch (KL15), or Ignition Coil 
Power Relay (>9/97 activated by the ignition switch KL15). The ECM provides a ground 
path for the primary coil (Terminal 1) by activating a Final Stage transistor. The length of time 
that current flows through the primary winding is the “dwell” which allows the coil to “satu¬ 
rate” or build up a magnetic field. After this storage process, the ECM will interupt the pri¬ 
mary circuit at the point of ignition by deactivating the Final Stage transistor. The magnetic 
field built up within the primary winding collapses and induces the ignition voltage in the 
secondary winding. 


46 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Ignition Management 

































































































The voltage generated in the secondary winding 
is capable of 50,000 volts (50 KV). The high 
voltage is discharged (Terminal 4) through the 
secondary ignition spark plug connector (boot) 
to the spark plug. 


The primary and secondary windings are un¬ 
coupled, therefore, the secondary winding 
requies a ground supply (Terminal 4a). 


The secondary grounds through a “shunt resis¬ 
tor” (approximately 235 ohms). The secondary 
ground is also supplied to the ECM which 
allows monitoring of secondary ignition. The 
resistor is located in the wiring tray on top of the 
cylinder head cover. 

As the secondary magnetic field collapses, a voltage spike is induced in the windings. The 
ECM monitors the voltage drop across the resistor as an indication of coil firing. After the 
ECM activates the primary ignition, this feedback signal (Terminal 4a Signal) is confirma¬ 
tion that secondary ignition took place. The ECM measures the duration of time it takes the 
voltage drop for each ignition coil to dissipate below two volts. The time scale constantly 
changes based on engine rpm. 



• If the 2 volt signal is not maintained long enough, the ECM detects a week spark. 

• If the feedback signal is not present (0 volts) ignition did not take place. 


If the signal is missing, an ignition coil fault will be set for that cylinder. If multiple signals are 
missing, a feedback circuit fault will be set. If the ground circuit is defective, a ground fault 
will be set. 

There is an individual ignition circuit and coil for 
each cylinder on the MS41 .X system. 

The six individual ignition coils (1) are coupled to 
spark plug connectors (2) which contain a resis¬ 
tor. The assemblies are mounted on top of the 
cylinder head cover. 

There are two manufacturers of ignition coils: 

Bremi and Bosch. 



47 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Ignition Management 




































































Spark Plugs: The spark plugs introduce the ignition energy 
into the combustion chamber. The high voltage “arcs” across 
the air gap in the spark plug from the positive electrode to the 
negative electrode. This creates a spark which ignites the 
combustable air/fuel mixture. 

The spark plugs are located in the center of the combustion 
area (on the top of the cylinder head) which is the most suit¬ 
able point for igniting the compressed air/fuel mixture. 

The correct spark plugs for this system are: 

• Bosch F8LDCR (dual electrode, non-adjustable gap) 


Note: The High Performance Platinum Spark Plugs are also 
approved for use. 

• NGK BKR6EQUP (quad electrode, non-adjustable gap) 



13550015.eps 


Faults with the Ignition Output Components are monitored by the ECM. If there are 
faults with the ignition coil(s) output and/or spark plugs, the following complaints could be 
encountered: 

• “CHECK ENGINE” Light With Mixture Related Fault Codes 

• Poor Engine Performance 

• Engine Misfire 

• No Start / Hard Starting 

• Excessive Exhaust Emissions / Black Smoke 


The ignition is monitored by the ECM via the secondary ignition feedback circuit and 
Crankshaft Position/RPM Sensor. If a Misfire fault is present, the “CHECK ENGINE” Light 
will illuminate when the OBD II criteria is achieved and the ECM will deactivate the corre¬ 
sponding fuel injector for that cylinder. Engine operation will still be possible. 

The Ignition Output Components must be individually tested (see Workshop Hints). 


48 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Ignition Management 










Knock Sensors: are required to prevent detonation (pinging) from damaging the engine. 
The Knock Sensor is a piezoelectric conductor-sound microphone. The ECM will retard the 
ignition timing (cylinder selective) based on the input of these sensors. Detonation can 
occur due to: 

• High Compression Ratio • Maximum Timing Advance Curve 

• Poor Quality Fuel (Octane Rating) • High Intake Air and Engine Temperature 

• High Level of Cylinder Filling • Carbon Build-Up (Combustion Chamber) 


The Knock Sensor consists of: 

1. Shielded Wire 

2. Cup Spring 

3. Seismic Mass 

4. Housing 

5. Inner Sleeve 

6. Piezo-Ceramic Element 



A piezo-ceramic ring is clamped between a seismic mass and the sensor body. When the 
seismic mass senses vibration (flexing), it exerts a force on the peizo-ceramic element. 
Opposed electrical charges build up on the upper and lower ceramic surfaces which gen¬ 
erates a voltage signal. The acoustic vibrations are converted into electrical signals. These 
low voltage signals are transmitted to the ECM for processing. 


There are two Knock Sensors bolted to the 
engine block on the intake manifold side, (1) 
between cylinders 1 - 3 and (2) between cylin¬ 
ders 4 - 6. If the signal value exceeds the 
threshold, the ECM identifies the “knock” and 
retards the ignition timing for that cylinder. 

If a fault is detected with the sensor(s), the ECM 
deactivates Knock Control. The “CHECK 
ENGINE” Light will be illuminated when the 
OBD II criteria is achieved, the ignition timing 
will be set to a conservative basic setting and a 
fault will be stored.

Crankshaft Position/RPM Sensor: This sensor provides the crankshaft position and 
engine speed (RPM) signal to the ECM for ignition activation and correct tinning. This input 
is also monitored for Misfire Detection. For details about the sensor, refer to the Fuel 
Management section. 

A fault with this input will produce the following 
complaints: 

• No Start 

• Intermitant Misfire/Driveabilty 

• Engine Stalling 




SMOOTH RUNNING ENGINE 

(NOTE SQUARE WAVE SIGNAL) 1 355001 0. epS 


Camshaft Position Sensor (Cylinder Identification): The cylinder ID sensor input 
allows the ECM to determine camshaft position in relation to crankshaft position. It is used 
by the ECM to establish the “working cycle” of the engine for precise ignition timing. For 
details about the sensor, refer to the Fuel Management section. 


If the ECM detects a fault with the Cylinder ID Sensor, 
the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illuminated when 
the OBD II criteria is achieved and the system will still 
operate precise single ignition based on the Crank¬ 
shaft Position/RPM Sensor. 

If the signal is impaired during a restart, the ECM will 
activate “double ignition”. The ignition coils will be 
activated on both the compression and exhaust 
strokes to maintain engine operation.

Engine Coolant Temperature: The ECM 

determines the correct ignition timing required 
for the engine temperature. For details about 
the sensor, refer to the Fuel Management sec¬ 
tion. This sensor is located in the coolant jacket 
of the cylinder head. 


If the Coolant Temperature Sensor input is 
faulty, the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illumi¬ 
nated when the OBD II criteria is achieved and 
the ECM will assume a substitute value (80° C) 
to maintain engine operation. The ignition timing 
will be set to a conservative basic setting. 


Throttle Position Sensor: This sensor provides the 
ECM with throttle angle position and rate of movement. 
As the throttle is opened the ECM will advance the igni¬ 
tion timing. The “full throttle” position indicates maxi¬ 
mum acceleration to the ECM, the ignition will be 
advanced for maximum torque. For details about the 
sensor, refer to the Air Management section. 

If the Throttle Position input is defective, a fault code 
will be set and the “Check Engine” Light will illuminate 
when the OBD II criteria is achieved. The ECM will 
maintain engine operation based on the HFM and the 
Engine Speed Sensor, and the ignition timing will be set 
to a conservative basic setting. 


Hot-Film Air Mass Meter: This input is used by the 
ECM to determine the amount of ignition timing 
advance based on the amount of intake air volume. For 
details about the sensor, refer to the Air Management 
section. 


If this input is defective, a fault code will be set and the 
“CHECK ENGINE” Light will illuminate when the OBD II 
criteria is achieved. The ECM will maintain engine oper¬ 
ation based on the Throttle Position Sensor and Engine 
Speed Sensor, and the ignition timing will be set to a 
conservative basic setting.

Air Temperature: This signal allows the ECM to make a calculation of air density. The sen¬ 
sor is located in the intake manifold behind the throttle housing. For details about the sen¬ 
sor, refer to the Air Management section. 


The ECM will adjust the ignition timing based on 
air temperature. If the intake air is hot the ECM 
retards the igniton timing to reduce the risk of 
detonation. If the intake air is cooler, the ignition 
timing will be advanced. 

If this input is defective, a fault code will be set 
and the “Check Engine” Light will illuminate

Principle of Operation 


Ignition Management provides ignition to the combustion chambers with the required volt¬ 
age at the correct time. Based on the combination of inputs, the ECM calculates and con¬ 
trols the ignition timing and secondary output voltage by regulating the activation and 
dwell of the primary ignition circuits. The ECM controls and monitors the primary igni¬ 
tion circuits and the secondary ignition output including Misfire Detection. 


13550020.eps 



IGNITION COIL 
POWER RELAY 
(> 1 - 97 ) 


The ECM has a very “broad” range of ignition timing. This is possible by using a Direct 
Ignition System, or sometimes refered to as “Static Ignition System” (RZV). Reliability is also 
increased by having separate individual ignition circuits. 


The Ignition Control is determined by the ECM (load dependant). The ECM will calculate 
the engine “load” based on a combination of the following inputs: 


• Battery Voltage 

• Throttle Position 

• Air Flow Volume 

• Air Temperature 

• Engine Coolant 

• Crankshaft Position/RPM 

• Camshaft Position (Cylinder ID) 

• Knock Sensors 



The dwell time will be regulated based on battery voltage. When cranking, the voltage is 
low and the ECM will increase the dwell to compensate for saturation “lag time”. When the 
engine is running and the battery voltage is higher, the ECM will decrease the dwell due to 
faster saturation time. 

The Crankshaft Position/RPM signals the ECM to start ignition in firing order (1 -5-3-6-2-4) 
as well as providing information about the engine operation. This input is used in combina¬ 
tion with other inputs to determine engine load which advances/retards the ignition timing. 
Without this input, the ECM will not activate the ignition. 


53 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Ignition Management 















































Cold start is determined by the 
ECM based on the engine 
coolant temperature and rpm 
during start up. A cold engine will 
crank over slower than a warm 
engine, the ignition timing will 
range between top dead center 
to slightly retarded providing opti¬ 
mum starting. 

When starting a warm engine, the 
rpm is higher which results in 
slightly advanced timing. 

If the engine coolant and intake 
air temperature is hot, the ignition 
timing will not be advanced 
reducing starter motor “load”. 



12550010.eps 


Multiple Ignition Pulses ensure good spark 
quality during engine start up. The ECM will 
activate the ignition coils 9 times per 720° of 
crankshaft revolution. 

The ignition timing will be progressively 
advanced assisting the engine in coming up to 
speed. As the engine speed approaches idle 
rpm, the timing remains slightly advanced to 
boost torque. When the engine is at idle speed, 
minimum timing advance is required. This will 
allow faster engine and catalyst warm up. 



The multiple pulsing switches to single pulse after the engine has been running for a short 
period of time or: 

• Engine Temperature >55° 

• Engine Speed >800 RPM 


The timing will be advanced when the ECM observes low engine rpm and increasing throt¬ 
tle/air volume inputs (acceleration torque). As the throttle is opened, the ECM advances the 
timing based on engine acceleration and at what rate. The ECM will fully advance timing for 
the “full throttle” position indicating maximum acceleration (torque). 


54 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Ignition Management 









































































































































































































































































The HFM signal represents the amount of intake air volume. This input is used by the ECM 
to determine the amount of timing advance to properly combust the air/fuel mixture. 

The Air Temperature Signal assists the ECM in reducing the risk of detonation (ping). If the 
intake air is hot the ECM retards the igniton timing. If the intake air is cooler, the ignition tim¬ 
ing will be advanced. 

As the throttle is closed, the ECM decreases the ignition timing if the rpm is above idle 
speed (coasting). This feature lowers the engine torque for deceleration. When the engine 
rpm approaches idle speed, the timing is slightly advanced to prevent the engine from 
stalling. The amount of advance is dependent upon the engine temperature and the rate of 
deceleration. 

Knock Control allows the ECM to further advance the ignition timing under load for 
increased torque. This system uses two Knock Sensors located between cylinders 1,2,3 
and between cylinders 4,5,6. Knock Control is only in affect when the engine temperature 
is greater than 35 °C and there is a load on the engine. This will disregard false signals while 
idling or from a cold engine. 


Based on the firing order, the 
ECM monitors the Knock Sen¬ 
sors after each ignition for a nor¬ 
mal (low) signal. 


If the signal value exceeds the 
threshold, the ECM identifies the 
“knock” and retards the ignition 
timing (3°) for that cylinder the 
next time it is fired. This process 
is repeated in 3° increments until 
the knock ceases. 

The ignition timing will be adv¬ 
anced again in increments to just 
below the knock limit and main¬ 
tain the timing at that point.

If a fault is detected with the Knock Sensor(s) or circuits, the ECM deactivates Knock 
Control. The ignition timing will be set to a conservative basic setting (to reduce the risk of 
detonation) and a fault will be stored. The “CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illuminated when 
the OBD II criteria is achieved.

Workshop Hints 


Before any service work is performed on any ignition system related component, 
always adhere to the following: 

• Observe relevent safety legislation pertaining to your area 

• Always wear adequate protection clothing including eye protection. 

• Use caution when working around a HOT engine compartment. 

• Always consult the REPAIR INSTRUCTIONS on the specific model you are working on before 
attempting a repair. 

• Always SWITCH OFF THE IGNITION (KL15) before working on the ignition system. 

• Use only BMW approved test leads. 

• NEVER TOUCH COMPONENTS CONDUCTING CURRENT with the engine running. 

• Do not connect suppression devices or a “test light” to terminal 1 of the ignition coils. 

• Terminal 1 from the ignition coil to the ECM (High Voltage approximately 350 V) 


HIGH VOLTAGE - DANGER! 

Caution! Hazardous voltages occur at: 

• Ignition Leads 

• Spark Plug Connector 

• Spark Plug 

• Ignition Coil (High Voltage at terminal 4 is approximately 30 KV) 

• Terminal 1 from the ignition coil to the ECM (High Voltage approximately 350V) 


56 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Ignition Management 




















Ignition System Diagnosis 


A fault survey should first be performed using the DIS/MoDIC to determine if there is a fault 
in the primary ignition or secondary ignition. If there is a fault in the primary ignition, testing 
should include: 


Power Supply at the Coil (KL15) 


• Resistance of the harness and ignition coil 
primary winding (terminal 15 to 1 approximate 
0.8 ohms) - using the 88 Pin Adapter with the 
ECM disconnected 


A. ECM Primary Circuit Final Stage Transistor 


B. ECM Ignition Coil (one of six) 


C. Secondary Coil Ground 



ECM Final Stage transistor activation. This test 
function is found under the Oscilloscope Preset 
list - “Ignition Signal Primary” (normal Terminal 1 
Signal shown on the right). 

Install the 88 Pin Adapter, Diagnostic cable, 
MFK 2 negative lead to ECM ground and MFK 
2 positive lead to the ground activation circuit 
for Terminal 1 of the ignition coil. This test is per¬ 
formed with the engine running. 


The Terminal 4a Signal should be tested 
using the DIS “Preset Measurements”. Refer to 
the HELP button for additional (on screen) con¬ 
nections. 

There is one signal present for each secondary 
ignition. This signal represents successful coil 
induction. 

This Signal does not verify the adapter 
(boot) and spark plug is functioning cor¬ 
rectly! Therefore additional secondary igni¬ 
tion testing should be performed.

If there is a fault in the secondary ignition, testing should include: 


• Primary Ignition • Evaluation of Secondary Oscilloscope Patterns 


The Following are Examples of Secondary 
Oscilloscope Patterns (consult Repair 
Instructions for ignition pattern variations per 
coil manufacturer): 

This is a normal pattern for one ignition circuit 
with the engine at idle speed. 


1. Normal Combustion Period 


2. Normal Ignition Voltage Peak 


Multiple Ignition Pulses ensure good spark 
quality during engine start up. The ECM will 
activate the ignition coils 9 times per 720° of 
crankshaft revolution. 

This is a normal pattern for one ignition circuit 
when: 


• Engine Temperature <55° C 


• Engine speed <800 RPM

The Repair Instructions should be consulted for additional Oscilloscope Patterns under var¬ 
ious engine speeds. 

In Summary, 

If the Secondary Ignition Voltage is Too High (Excessive Resistance for Ignition): 

• Spark Plug Gap is to Large (Worn or Burned) 

• Incorrect Heat Range Spark Plug 

• Compression is too High (Carbon, etc.) 

• Lean Mixture (Vacuum Leak, etc.) 

• Interruption in the Secondary Ignition Connector or Resistive Adapter Boot 


If the Secondary Ignition Voltage is Too Low (Low Resistance for Ignition): 

• Spark Plug Gap is Too Small (Mishandled on Installation) 

• Incorrect Heat Range Spark Plug 

• Compression is Too Low 

• Voltage Leak in the Secondary Ignition Connector or Resistive Boot to Ground 


Spark Plugs 

The Spark Plugs should be inspected for the proper type, gap 
and replaced at the specified intervals. 

Refer to the Service Information Bulletin S.l. #12 01 99 for the 
proper type and a visual of the spark plug (showing effects of 
combustion, fouling, etc.)

should be visually inspected and checked for 
resistance. 

For example, the Resistive Adapter Boot has a

facturer: 

• Bosch - Ik ohm +/- 20% 

• Bremi -1.8k ohm +/- 20%

The Knock Sensors should be tested using the 
DIS/MoDIC for: _ 

• Fault Codes 

• Status Display - Knock Control 
(active / not active) 

• Oscilloscope Display (Low DC Voltage - mV 
setting) 


When installing Knock Sensors: 



DO NOT MIX THE LOCATIONS or Engine 
Damage will result! The Knock Sensors use a 
combined connection to the engine harness. 
The Knock Sensor with the shorter cable is for 
cylinders 4 - 6. 

Do Not Over Tighten attaching bolt! - Piezo 
ceramic will be cracked. Torque to 20 nm. 

Do Not Under Tighten attaching bolt, a lose 
sensor can vibrate producing a similar signal to

Tools and Equipment 


The DIS/Modic as well as a reputable hand held 
multimeter can be used when testing inputs/ 
components. 

It is best to make the checks at the ECM con¬ 
nection, this method includes testing the wiring 
harness. 

The correct Universal Adapter for the MS41 .X 
application should be used (#88 88 6 614 410). 
This will ensure the pin connectors and the har¬ 
ness will not be damaged. 

The interior of this Universal Adapter is shielded, 
therefore it is vital that the ground cable is con¬ 
nected to the vehicle chassis whenever the 
adapter is used. 

The adapter uses a Printed Circuit board inside 
keeping the capacitive and inductive load to a 
minimum. 

When installing the Universal Adapter to the 
ECM (located below the windshield on the pas¬ 
senger side of the engine compartment), make 
sure the ignition is switched off. 





When Testing the Secondary Ignition System, 
use Special Tool #88 88 6 127 040 (Secondary 
Ignition Adapter Set shown to the right) which 
connects to the DIS. The instruction book is 
included with the kit. Refer to the HELP button 
for additional (on screen) connections.

Evaporative Emissions: The control of the evaporative fuel vapors (Hydrocarbons) from 
the fuel tank is important for the overall reduction in vehicle emissions. The evaporative sys¬ 
tem has been combined with the ventilation of the fuel tank, which allows the tank to breath 
(equalization). The overall operation provides: 

• An inlet vent, to an otherwise “sealed” fuel tank, for the entry of air to replace the fuel 
consumed during engine operation. 

• An outlet vent with a storage canister to “trap and hold” fuel vapors that are produced 
by the expansion/evaporation of fuel in the tank, when the vehicle is stationary. 


The canister is then "purged" using the engine vacuum to draw the fuel vapors into the 
combustion chamber. This "cleans" the canister allowing for additional storage. Like any 
other form of combustible fuel, the introduction of these vapors on a running engine must 
be controlled. 

The ECM controls the Evaporative Emission Valve which regulates purging of evaporative 
vapors. The evaporative system must be monitored for correct purge operation and Leak 
Detection.

On-Board Refueling Vapor Recovery (ORVR 98 MY E39): The ORVR system recovers 
and stores hydrocarbon fuel vapor that was previously released during refueling. Non ORVR 
vehicles vent fuel vapors from the tank venting line back to the filler neck and in many states 
reclaimed by a vacuum receiver on the filling station’s fuel pump nozzle. 

When refueling an ORVR equipped vehicle, the pressure of the fuel entering the tank forces 
the hydrocarbon vapors through the larger tank vent line to the liquid/ vapor separator, 
through the rollover valve and into the charcoal canister. The HC is stored in the charcoal 
canister, and the system can then “breath” through the LDP and the air filter. 

The vent line to the filler neck is smaller, but still necessary for checking the filler cap/neck 
during Evaporative Leak Testing. 


Liquid/Vapor Separator: Fuel vapors are routed from the fuel tank filler neck through a 
hose to the Liquid/Vapor Separator (E36 shown, consult Repair Instructions for E39/Z3). 
The vapors cool when exiting the fuel tank, the condensates separate and drain back to 
the fuel tank through a return hose. The remaining vapors exit the Liquid/ Vapor Separator 
to the Active Carbon Canister. 


Fuel Tank Pressure Sensor (E36/Z3 Vehicles): The pressure transducer mounted on the 
liquid/ vapor separator (fuel tank on Z3) provides the fuel tank pressure input to the ECM. 
This is used by the ECM to check the fuel storage and evaporative (purge) system for leaks. 

The pressure sensor receives a power supply 
from the ECM and produces a varying voltage 
input (0-5v) to the ECM, representing the 
amount of pressure in the fuel tank/evaporative 
system. 

If this input is defective, a fault code will be set 
and the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will illuminate 
when the OBD II criteria is achieved. 



13550060.eps

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 




Active Carbon Cannister: As the hydrocarbon vapors enter the 3 liter canister, they will 
be absorbed by the active carbon. The remaining air will be vented to the atmosphere 
through the end of the canister allowing the fuel tank to “breath”. When the engine is run¬ 
ning, the canister is then "purged" using intake manifold vacuum to draw air through the 
canister which extracts the hydrocarbon vapors into the combustion chamber. The canis¬ 
ter is located in the spare tire well (E36 shown, consult Repair Instructions for E39/Z3). 


Air Inlet Shut Off Valve (E36 VEHICLES): A shut-off valve is installed on the intake or 
vent side of the charcoal canister as a component of the vacuum type Evaporative Fuel 
System Leak system. 


Operation of the valve is controlled by the ECM. 
When the shut-off valve and purge valve are 
closed, the entire fuel tank/evaporative system 
is sealed from the atmosphere. 


The shut-off valve is required to test the system 
for leaks. If this valve is defective, a fault code 
will be set and the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will 
illuminate when the OBD II criteria is achieved. 



Evaporative Emission Valve: This ECM controlled solenoid valve regulates the purge flow 
from the Active Carbon Canister into the intake manifold (located next to the HFM). The 
ECM Relay provides operating voltage and the ECM controls the valve by regulating the 
ground circuit. The valve is powered open and closed by an internal spring. 


If the Evaporative Emission Valve circuit is 
defective, a fault code will be set and the 
“CHECK ENGINE” Light will illuminate when 
the OBD II criteria is achieved. 


If the valve is “mechanically” defective, a drive- 
ability complaint could be encountered and a 
mixture related fault code will be set.

LDP (Leak Diagnosis Pump - E39): The LDP pro¬ 
vides a means of testing the fuel/evaporative system 
for leaks. The pump is activated by ECM control. It 
pressurizes the fuel tank and evaporative system. 


The upper chamber contains an integrated reed switch 
that produces a switched high/low voltage signal that 
is monitored by the ECM. The switch is opened by the 
magnetic interruption of the metal rod connected to 
the diaphragm when in the top dead center position. 

The repetitive up/down stroke is confirmation to the 
ECM that the valve is functioning and the basis for 
determining if a leak is present in the system.

The ECM monitors the length of time it takes for the reed switch to open, which is opposed 

by pressure under the diaphragm in the lower chamber. If this component/circuits are 

defective, a fault code will be set and the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will illuminate when the 
OBD II criteria is achieved. 


Barometric Pressure Sensor (98 MY E39): 

The 1998 528i with MS 41.1 requires an addi¬ 
tional input signal for activation of the LDP func¬ 
tion test. 

The sensor is located on passenger side strut 
tower forward of ASC 5 Hydraulic Unit. 


The LDP test function can occur during a long 
trip. If the test occurs while the vehicle is driven 
down a very steep grade just prior to the LDP 
test, the barometric pressure sensor provides a 
rapid change (varied DC voltage signal) inform¬ 
ing the ECM to postpone the test function. 

If this component/circuits are defective, a fault 
code will be set and the “CHECK ENGINE” 
Light will illuminate when the OBD II criteria is 
achieved.

Exhaust Emissions: The combustion process of a gasoline powered engine produces 
Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrocarbons (HC) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx). 


• Carbon Monoxide is a product of incomplete combustion under conditions of air deficiency. 
CO emissions are strongly dependent on the air/fuel ratio. 

• Hydrocarbon are also a product of incomplete combustion which results in unburned fuel. HC 
emissions are dependent on air/fuel ratio and the ignition of the mixture. 

• Oxides of Nitrogen are a product of peak combustion temperature (and temperature duration). 
NOx emissions are dependent on internal cylinder temperature affected by the air/fuel ratio 
and ignition of the mixture. 


Control of exhaust emissions is accomplished by the engine and engine management 
design as well as after-treatment. 

• The ECM manages exhaust emissions by controlling the air/fuel ratio and ignition. 

• The ECM controlled Secondary Air Injection further dilutes exhaust emissions leaving the 
engine and reduces the catalyst warm up time. 

• The Catalytic Converter further reduces exhaust emissions leaving the engine. 


68 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 








































































Siemens Oxygen Sensor: The pre-catalyst 
oxygen sensors (single sensor for 323i and Z3) 
measure the residual oxygen content of the 
exhaust gas. The sensors vary in resistance 
proportional to the oxygen content that allows 
the ECM to monitor the air/fuel ratio. If neces¬ 
sary, the ECM will “correct” the air/fuel ratio by 
regulating the injection time. The sensors are 
mounted in the exhaust manifolds on the 
E36/E39 (1), up-stream of the catalytic convert¬ 
er. The 323i and Z3 sensor mounts in the down 
pipe. 


The probe of the sensor which is exposed to the 
exhaust gas is made from titanium dioxide (semi-con- 
ductive material). When heated and maintained to an 
operating temperature of 600° to 700° C, the titanium 
dioxide becomes conductive and will allow current to 
flow, based on the amount of oxygen content. 

The ECM supplies the oxygen sensors with 5 volts. 
The ECM then monitors the voltage drop through the 
tip of the sensors as a measure oxygen deviation.

The resistance value of the sensor changes 
rapidly when the mixture deviates. If the oxygen 
content of the exhaust is high (lean mixture), the 
oxygen molecules will block the flow of elec¬ 
trons through the titanium dioxide. This creates 
high resistance and a small voltage drop 
across the sensor tip (4.6v monitored by the 
ECM). If the oxygen content in the exhaust is 
low (rich mixture), the resistance in the semi- 
conductive tip decreases and allows electron 
flow, creating a large voltage drop (0.1 v moni¬ 
tored by the ECM). 


The voltage signal monitored by the ECM will vary between approximately 4.6 to 0.1 volts 
as the mixture changes from lean to rich. The ECM monitors the length of time the sensor 
is operating in the lean, rich (including time of rise and fall) and rest conditions. The evalu¬ 
ation period of the sensor is over a predefined number of oscillation cycles.

Direct Oxygen Sensor Heating: The oxygen sensor conductivity is efficient when it is hot 
(600° - 700° C). For this reason, the sensors contain heating elements. These “heated” sen¬ 
sors reduce warm up time and retain the heat during low engine speed when the exhaust 
temperature is cooler. OBD II requires monitoring of the oxygen sensor heating function and 
heating elements for operation. 


The four oxygen sensor heating 
circuits (E36/E39 shown) receive 
operating voltage from the ECM 
Relay when KL15 is switched 
“ON”. Each of the sensor heaters 
are controlled through separate 
final stage transistors. 

The sensor heaters are controlled 
with a pulsed square wave volt¬ 
age during a cold start. This 
allows the sensors to be brought 
up to operating temperature with¬ 
out the possibility of thermal 
shock. The duty cycle is then var¬ 
ied to maintain the heating of the 
sensors. 



When the engine is decelerating (closed throttle), the ECM increases the duty cycle of the- 
heating elements to compensate for the decreased exhaust temperature. 


Metal Monolith Catalytic Converter: The dual (single on the 323i and Z3) three-way cat¬ 
alysts on the E36/E39 (1) after-treats exhaust emissions leaving the engine. A properly 
operating catalyst consumes/stores most of the oxygen that is present in the exhaust gas 
which is a result of burning the remaining pollutants. 


The oxygen sensor monitors the air/fuel mixture 
which allows the ECM to maintain the correct 
mixture for catalyst efficiency. 

The gases that flow into the catalyst are con¬ 
verted from CO, HC and NOx to C02, H20 and 
N2. 



70 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 


13550043.eps 








































































































The exhaust flow heats the catalyst and with the remaining 
oxygen, the exhaust pollutants are further reduced by burning. 
The temperature operating range for the highest efficiency is 
400° - 800° C which is also influenced by the air/fuel mixture. 
This type of catalyst will store small amounts of excess oxygen 
which will aid in diluting the exhaust. 




This type of catalyst is compact and offers low back pressure 
with a large internal surface area. The metal monolith has a 
very rapid “light off” time and an even heat distribution. 


13550044.bmp 


The metal monolith matrix consists of thin (0.04 mm) metal 
strips (flat and corrugated) that are wound together to form cir¬ 
cular bodies. The complete wrapped assembly is inserted into 
a round sheet metal jacket (1.5 mm thick). The jacket and 
matrix are coated with chrome-nickel and chrome steel. 


13550045.bmp 


Catalytic Converter Monitoring: In order to determine if the 
catalysts are working correctly, post catalyst oxygen sensors 
(2 E36/E39 and single on the 323i and Z3)) are installed to 
monitor exhaust gas content exiting the catalysts. 

The signal of the post cat. 02 sensor is evaluated over the 
course of several pre cat. 02 sensor oscillations. During the 
evaluation period, the signal of the post cat. sensor must 
remain within a relatively constant voltage range (3.5 - 4.6v). 



13550044.eps 


The post cat. 02 voltage remains high with a 
very slight fluctuation. This indicates a consis- 
tant amount of oxygen when compared to the 
pre cat. sensor. 



If this signal decreased in voltage and/or 
increased in fluctuation, a fault code will be set 
for Catalyst Efficiency and the “CHECK 
ENGINE” Light will illuminate when the OBD II 
criteria is achieved.

Secondary Air Injection: Injecting ambient air into the exhaust stream after a cold engine 

start reduces the warm up time of the catalyst and reduces HC and CO emissions. The 

ECM controls and monitors the Secondary Air Injection. The components of the system 

(E36 shown) include: 

• Secondary Air Injection Pump - Electric pump that draws in ambient air and supplies it to the 
Non-Return Valve. The pump motor is activated by Secondary Air Injection Pump Relay. 

• Secondary Air Injection Pump Relay - Supplies operating voltage to the Secondary Air 
Injection Pump when activated by the ECM. 

• Vacuum Vent Valve (Solenoid) - Switches vacuum to open the Non-Return Valve when activated 
by the ECM. 

• Non-Return Valve - Opened by the Vacuum Vent Valve allowing air to be pumped into the 
exhaust stream. Sprung closed to prevent exhaust (pressure) from reaching the Secondary 
Air Injection Components. 

• Secondary Air Injection Pipes - Distributes injected air to the exhaust manifold for bank 1 
(cylinders 1,2,3) and bank 2 (cylinders 4,5,6). 



72 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 





























































































Misfire Detection: As part of the OBD II regulations the ECM must determine misfire and 
also identify the specific cylinder(s), the severity of the misfire and whether it is emissions 
relevant or catalyst damaging based on monitoring crankshaft acceleration. 

In order to accomplish these tasks the ECM monitors the crankshaft for acceleration by the 
impulse wheel segments of cylinder specific firing order. The misfire/engine roughness cal¬ 
culation is derived from the differences in the period duration of individual increment gear 
segments. 

Each segment period consist of 
an angular range of 90° crank 
angle that starts 54° before Top 
Dead Center. 

If the expected period duration is 
greater than the permissible 
value, a misfire fault for the par¬ 
ticular cylinder is stored in the 
fault memory of the ECM. 


Depending on the level of misfire 
rate measured, the ECM will illu¬ 
minate the "CHECK ENGINE" 

Light, deactivate the specific fuel 
injector to the particular cylinder 
and switch oxygen sensor con¬ 
trol to open-loop. 

In order to eliminate misfire faults that can occur as a result of varying flywheel tolerances 
(manufacturing process) an internal adaptation of the flywheel is made. The adaptation is 
made during periods of decel fuel cut-off in order to avoid any rotational irregularities which 
the engine can cause during combustion. This adaptation is used to correct segment dura¬ 
tion periods prior to evaluation for a misfire event. 

If the sensor wheel adaptation has not been completed the misfire thresholds are limited to 
engine speed dependent values only and misfire detection is less sensitive. The crankshaft 
sensor adaptation is stored internally and is not displayed via DIS or MoDIC. If the adapta¬ 
tion limit is exceeded, a fault will be set.

Principle of Operation 

Emissions Management controls evaporative and exhaust emissions. The ECM monitors 
the fuel storage system for evaporative leakage and controls the purging of evaporative 
vapors. The ECM monitors and controls the exhaust emissions by regulating the com- 
bustable mixture and after treating by injecting fresh air into the exhaust system. The 
catalytic converter further breaks down remaining combustable exhaust gases and is mon¬ 
itored by the ECM for catalyst efficiency. 



The Evaporative Leakage Detection (E36 and Z3) is conducted by the ECM and can 

detect a leak as small as 1 .Omm (0.040”) when the following conditions are met: 


• No faults present. There are several fault codes relating to the evaporative system. In 
addition, the ECM also monitors the components for evaporative system operation. Any 
detected faults will be stored in the memory and the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will illuminate 
when the OBD II critera is achieved and the test will not conclude. 


• Engine coolant temperature must be > 80° C. 

• Current altitude <2500m (8,202 Feet). 

• Accumulated Canister Purge time > 360 seconds (6 minutes) since start of drive cycle. 

• Canister purge cycle times between 10 and 150 seconds in length (dependent on HC 
saturation). 

• Vehicle speed = 0 (vehicle at standstill). 

• Engine Speed = idle 


Once all of the testing criteria have been met, the ECM will start the test on the evapora¬ 
tive system. The test is carried out in the following sequence: 


• The ECM reads and stores the current fuel tank pressure input value. 

• The Evaporative Emission Valve and shut-off valve are closed for approx. 8 seconds. 


74 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 







































































































• The ECM reads the pressure build up in the fuel tank. If the pressure build up is below a 
stored threshold value, the Evaporative Emission Valve is switched on for approximately 
3 seconds. 

• The ECM reads the tank pressure after purging. If the pressure has dropped, the purge 
function is OK. 

• The Evaporative Emission Valve is switched OFF again for approximately 8 seconds. 

• The ECM reads the tank pressure again to verify pressure build up. 

• If the pressure build up is not within a stored value range, the ECM detects this as a leak 
within the evaporative system. 

• Depending on the degree of pressure build up, the ECM detects this as a leak within the 
evaporative system. 

• Following the test cycle, the shut-off valve is switched OFF and normal purge operation 
is resumed.

The Evaporative Leakage Detection (98 MY E39) uses a Leak Diagnosis Pump (LDP) to 
pressurize the fuel tank and the evaporative emission system (approx. 25mb.). The LDP 
equipped system is capable of detecting a leak as small as 0.5 mm. (0.020”). The LDP is 
located in the left rear (driver’s side) fender well and is only replaceable as a complete com¬ 
ponent. The vacuum supply line (required for pump operation) is in the wiring harness from 
the engine compartment and runs down the driver’s side of the vehicle. 

The LDP is a unitized component that contains the following: 

• Vacuum Chamber. 

• Pneumatic Pressure Chamber. 

• DME Activated Vacuum Solenoid. 

• Reed Switch - Providing A Switched Voltage Feedback Signal To The ECM. 


In the inactive state, the LDP diaphragm is at 
the bottom end (of down stroke). The diaphr¬ 
agm pushes a rod downward against spring 
pressure to open the canister vent valve. 

This open valve serves as the filtered air inlet 
path for normal evaporative “breathing”. 

During Leak Testing of the evaporative system, 
the vent valve is sprung closed to block atmos¬ 
pheric venting. The Evaporative Emission Valve 
is also sprung closed to seal the system. 



During every engine cold start the LDP solenoid 
is energized by the ECM. Engine manifold vac¬ 
uum enters the upper chamber of the LDP to lift 
up the spring loaded diaphragm. 

As the diaphragm is lifted it draws in ambient air 
through the filter and into the lower chamber of 
the LDP through the one way valve. 



76 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 




























































































































































































































































































The solenoid is then de-energized, spring pres¬ 
sure closes the vacuum port blocking the 
engine vacuum and simultaneously opens the 
vent port to the balance tube which releases 
the captive vacuum in the upper chamber. 

This allows the compressed spring to push the 
diaphragm down, starting the “limited down 
stroke”. The air that was drawn into the lower 
chamber of the LDP during the upstroke is 
forced out of the lower chamber and into the 
fueltank/evaporative system. 



• This electrically controlled repetitive up/down stroke is cycled repeatedly building up a total 
pressure of approximately +25mb in the evaporative system. After sufficient pressure has built 
up (LDP and its cycling is calibrated to the vehicle), the leak diagnosis begins and lasts about 
100 seconds. 


• The upper chamber contains an integrated reed switch that produces a switched high/low 
voltage signal that is monitored by the ECM. The switch is opened by the magnetic interrup 
tion of the metal rod connected to the diaphram is in the top dead center position. 


• The repetitive up/down stroke is confirmation to the ECM that the valve is functioning. The 
ECM also monitors the length of time it takes for the reed switch to open, which is opposed by 
pressure under the diaghragm in the lower chamber. The LDP is still cycled, but at a frequen 
cy that depends upon the rate of pressure loss in the lower chamber. 


• If the pumping frequency is below parameters, there is no leak present. If the pumping fre 
quency is above parameters, this indicates sufficient pressure can not build up in the lower 
chamber and evaporative system, indicating a leak. 


77 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 



















































































































































The chart represents the diagnostic leak testing time frame in seconds. When the ignition 
is switched on, the ECM performs a “static check” of circuit integrity to the LDP pump 
including the reed switch. 



• On cold engine start up, the pump is activated for the first 27 seconds at approximately 
166-200 Hz. This rapid pumping phase is required to pressurized the evaporative components. 


• Once pressurized, the build up phase then continues from 27-38 seconds. The ECM monitors 
the system through the reed switch to verify that pressure has stabilized. 


• The measuring phase for leak diagnosis lasts from 38-63 seconds. The pump is activated 
but due to the pressure build up under the diaphragm, the pump moves slower, if the pump 
moves quickly, this indicates a lack of pressure of a leak. The registers as a fault in the 
ECM’s. 


• From 63-100 seconds the pump is deactivated, allowing full down stroke of the diaphragm 
and rod. At the extreme bottom of rod travel, the canister vent valve is pushed open relieving 
pressure and allowing normal purge operation when needed. 


78 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 

























































































































Evaporative Emission Purging is regultated by the ECM controlling the Evaporative 
Emission Valve. The Evaporative Emission Valve is a solenoid that regulates purge flow from 
the Active Carbon Cannister into the intake manifold. The ECM Relay provides operating 
voltage and the ECM controls the valve by regulating the ground circuit. The valve is pow¬ 


ered open and closed by an internal spring. 


The “purging” process takes place when: 

• Oxygen Sensor Control Is Active. 

• Engine Coolant Temperature is > 67° C. 

• Engine Load is present.

The Evaporative Emission Valve is opened in stages to moderate the purging. 


• Stage 1 opens the valve for 10 ms (mill-seconds) and then closes for 150 ms. 

• The stages continue with increasing opening times (up to 16 stages) until the valve is completely open. 

• The valve now starts to close in 16 stages in reverse order. 


• This staged process takes 6 minuites to complete. The function is inactive for 1 minuite then starts the 
the process all over again. 

• During the purging process the valve is completely opened during full throttle operation and is completely 
closed during deceleration fuel cutoff. 


Evaporative Purge System Flow Check is performed by the ECM when the oxygen 
sensor control and purging is active on the E39. When the Evaporative Emission Valve is 
open the ECM detects a rich/lean shift as monitored by the oxygen sensors indicating the 
valve is functioning properly. 

If the ECM does not detect a rich/lean shift a second step is performed when the vehicle 
is stationary and the engine is at idle speed. The ECM opens and close the valve (abrupt¬ 
ly) several times and monitors the engine rpm for changes. If there are no changes, a fault 
code will be set. The E36 and Z3 is checked during the Evaporative Leakage Test. 


79 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 






















































































Fuel System Monitoring is per¬ 
formed by the ECM which verifies 
the calculated injection time (ti) in 
relation to engine speed, load 
and the oxygen sensor signal as 
a result of the residual oxygen in 
the exhaust stream. 

The ECM uses the oxygen sensor 
signal as a correction factor for 
adjusting and optimizing the mix¬ 
ture pilot control under all engine 
operating conditions. 



Adaptation Values are stored by the ECM iln order to maintain an "ideal" air/fuel ratio. 
The ECM is capable of adapting to various environmental conditions encountered while the 
vehicle is in operation (changes in altitude, humidity, ambient temperature, fuel quality, etc.). 

The adaptation can only make slight corrections and can not compensate for large 
changes which may be encountered as a result of incorrect airflow or incorrect fuel supply 
to the engine. 

Within the areas of adjustable adaption, the ECM modifies the injection rate under two 
areas of engine operation: 

• During idle and low load mid range engine speeds (Additive Adaptation). 

• During operation under a normal to higher load when at highter engine speeds 
(Multiplicative Adaptation). 


These values indicate how the ECM is compensating for a less than ideal initial air/fuel ratio. 


NOTE: If the adaptation value is greater than "0.0” Additive (% Multiplicative), the ECM is 
trying to richen the mixture. If the adaptation value is less then "0.0” Additive (% 
Multiplicative), the ECM is trying to lean-out the mixture.

Catalyst Monitoring is performed by the ECM under oxygen sensor closed loop opera¬ 
tion. The changing air/fuel ratio in the exhaust gas results in lambda oscillations at the pre¬ 
catalyst sensors. These oscillations are dampened by the oxygen storage activity of the 
catalysts and are reflected at the post catalyst sensors as a fairly stable signal (indicating 
oxygen has been consumed). Conditions for Catalyst Monitoring: 

Reauirements 

Status/Condition 

• Closed Loop Operation 

Yes 

• Engine Coolant Temperature 

Operating Temperature 

• Vehicle Road Speed 

3-50 MPH (5 to 80 Km/h) 

• Catalyst Temperature (Calculated) 

350°C to 650° C 

• Throttle Angle Deviation 

Steady Throttle 

• Engine Speed Deviation 

Steady / Stable Engine Speed 

• Average Lamboda Value Deviation 

Steady / Stable Load 


* Catalyst temperature is an internally calculated value that is a function of load/air mass 
and time. 


As part of the monitoring process, the pre and 
post 02 sensor signals are evaluated by the 
ECM to determine the length of time each sen¬ 
sor is operating in the rich and lean range. 


If the catalyst is defective, the post 02 sensor 
signal will reflect the pre- 02 sensor signal 
(minus a phase shift/time delay), since the cat¬ 
alyst is no longer able to store oxygen. 


The catalyst monitoring process is stopped 
once the predetermined number of cycles are 
completed, until the engine is shut-off and start¬ 
ed again. After completing the next "customer 
driving cycle" whereby the specific conditions 
are met and a fault is again set, the "CHECK 
ENGINE” Light will be illuminated. 


Note: The catalyst efficiency is monitored once 
per trip while the vehicle is in closed loop oper¬ 
ation. 


ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 




































































Secondary Air Injection is required to reduce HC and CO emissions while the engine is 
warming up. Immediately following a cold engine start (-10 to 40°C) fresh air/oxygen is 
injected directly into the exhaust stream. 

The temperature signal is provid¬ 
ed to the ECM by the Air 
Temperature Sensor in the HFM*. 

The ECM provides a ground cir¬ 
cuit to activate the Secondary Air 
Injection Pump Relay. The relay 
supplies voltage to the Secon¬ 
dary Air Injection Pump. 


The single speed pump runs for 
approximately 90 seconds after 
engine start up. 


* Below -10° C the pump is acti¬ 
vated briefly to “blow out” any 
accumulated moisture. 



Secondary Air Injection Monitoring is performed by the ECM via the use of the pre-cat¬ 
alyst oxygen sensors. Once the air pump is active and air is injected into the exhaust sys¬ 
tem the oxygen sensor signals will indicate a lean condition (up to 16 seconds). 

If the oxygen sensor signals do not change 
within a predefined time, a fault will be set and 
identify the faulty bank (E36 328i and E39). 

If the additional oxygen is not detected for two 
consecutive cold starts, the ECM determines a 
general fault with the function of the secondary 
air injection system. After completing the next 
cold start and a fault is again detected the 
"CHECK ENGINE" Light will be illuminated 
when the OBD II criteria is achieved. 



82 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 









































































Misfire Detection is part of the OBD II regulations. The ECM must determine misfire and 
also identify the specific cylinder(s). The ECM must also determine the severity of the mis¬ 
fire and whether it is emissions relevant or catalyst damaging based on monitoring crank¬ 
shaft acceleration. 

Emission Increase: 

• Within an interval of 1000 crankshaft revolutions, the ECM adds the detected misfire events 
for each cylinder. If the sum of all cylinder misfire incidents exceeds the predetermined 
value, a fault code will be stored and the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illumnated. 

• If more than one cylinder is misfiring, all of the misfiring cylinders will be specified and the 
individual fault codes for each misfiring cylinder, or multiple cylinders will be stored. The 
“CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illuminated. 


Catalyst Damage: 

• Within an interval of 200 crankshaft revolutions the detected number of misfiring events is 
calculated for each cylinder. The ECM monitors this based on load/rpm. If the sum of cylinder 
misfire incidents exceeds a predetermined value, a “Catalyst Damaging” fault code is stored 
and the “CHECK ENGINE” Light will be illuminated. 


If the cylinder misfire count exceeds the predetermined threshold the ECM will take the 
following measures: 


• The oxygen sensor control will be 
switched to open loop. 


The cylinder selected fault code 
is stored. 


• If more than one cylinder is 
misfiring, the fault code for all 
individual cylinders and for 
multiple cylinders will be stored. 


The fuel injector to the respective 
cylinder(s) is deactivated.

The “CHECK ENGINE” Light, also referred to as the Malfunction Indicator Light ( MIL), is 
illuminated under the following conditions: 


• Upon the completion of the next consecutive 
driving cycle where the previously faulted 
system is monitored again and the emissions 
relevant fault is again present. 

• Immediately if a “Catalyst Damaging” fault 
occurs (See Misfire Detection). 



135500146.eps 


The illumination of the light is performed in accordance with the Federal Test Procedure 
(FTP) which requires the lamp to be illuminated when: 

• A malfunction of a component that can affect the emission performance of the vehicle occurs 
and causes emissions to exceed 1.5 times the standards required by the (FTP). 

• Manufacturer-defined specifications are exceeded. 

• An Implausible input signal is generated. 

• Catalyst deterioration causes HC-emissions to exceed a limit equivalent to 1.5 times the 
standard (FTP). 

• Misfire faults occur. 

• A leak is detected in the evaporative system or “purging” is defective. 

• ECM fails to enter closed-loop oxygen sensor control operation within a specified time 
interval. 

• Engine control or automatic transmission control enters a “limp home” operating mode. 

• Ignition is on (KL15) position before cranking = Bulb Check Function. 


Within the BMW system, the illumination of the check engine light is performed in accor¬ 
dance with the regulations set forth in CARB mail-out 1968.1 and as demonstrated via the 
Federal Test Procedure (FTP). The following page provides several examples of when and 
how the "CHECK ENGINE" Light is illuminated based on the "customer drive cycle".

1. A Fault Code is stored within the ECM upon the first occurrence of a fault in the system 
being checked. 

2. The “CHECK ENGINE” light will not be illuminated until the completion of the second 
consecutive “customer driving cycle” where the previously faulted system is again monitored 
and a fault is still present or a catalyst damaging fault has occcured. 

3. If the second drive cycle was not complete and the specific function was not checked as 
shown in the example, the ECM counts the third drive cycle as the “next consecutive” 
drive cycle. The “CHECK ENGINE” light to be illuminated. 

4. If there is an intermittent fault present and does not cause a fault to be set through multiple 
drive cycles, two complete consecutive drive cycles with the fault present are required for 
the “CHECK ENGINE” Light to be illuminated. 

5. Once the “CHECK ENGINE” Light is illuminated it will remain illuminated unless the specific 
function has been checked without fault through three complete consecutive drive cycles. 

6. The fault code will also be cleared from the memeory automatically if the specific function is 
checked through 40 consecutive drive cycles without the fault being detected or with the use 
of either the DIS, MODIC, or Scan Tool. 


NOTE: In order to clear a catalyst damaging fault (see Misfire Detection) from memory, the 
condition under which the fault occurred must be evaluated for 80 consecutive cycles with¬ 
out the fault reoccurring. 

With the use of a universal scan tool, connected to the "OBD" DLC an SAE standardized 
DTC can be obtained, along with the condition associated with the illumination of the 
"CHECK ENGINE" Light. Using the DIS or MODIC, a fault code and the conditions associ¬ 
ated with its setting can be obtained prior to the illumination of the "CHECK ENGINE" Light.

OBD II Drive Cycle’s & Trips 


• A “Drive Cycle” consists of engine startup and engine shutoff. 


• “Trip” is determined as vehicle operation (follow an engine-off period) of duration and driving 

style so that all components and systems are monitored at least once by the diagnostic 
system except catalyst efficiency or evaporative system monitoring. 

• Within this text the term “customer driving cycle” will be used and is defined as engine 
start-up, operation of vehicle (dependent upon customer drive style) and engine shut-off. 


Federal Test Procedure (FTP) 

The Federal Test Procedure (FTP) is a specific driving cycle that is utilized by the EPA to 
test light duty vehicle emissions. As part of the procedure for a vehicle manufacturer to 
obtain emission certification for a particular model/engine family the manufacturer must 
demonstrate that the vehicle(s) can pass the FTP defined driving cycle two consecutive 
times while monitoring various components/systems. 

Some of the components/systems must be monitored either once per driving cycle or 
continuously. Systems and their components required to be monitored once within one 
driving cycle: 

• Oxygen Sensors 

• Secondary Air Injection System 

• Catalyst Efficiency 

• Evaporative Vapor Recovery System 


Due to the complexity involved in meeting the test criteria within the FTP defined driving 
cycle, all tests may not be completed within one "customer driving cycle". The test can be 
successfully completed within the FTP defined criteria, however customer driving styles 
may differ and therefore may not always monitor all involved components/systems in one 
"trip". 


86 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 













Components/systems required to be monitored continuously: 


• Cylinder Misfire Detection 

• Fuel System 

• Oxygen Sensors 

• All Emissions Related Components / Systems - DME, EGS, or EML (comprehensive 
component monitoring). 


The graph shown below is an example of the driving cycle that is used by BMW to com¬ 
plete the FTP.

• Large Fluctuation In Throttle Angle 

• Road Speed Exceeds 60 MPH 


NOTE: The driving criteria shown can be completed within the FTP required ~11 miles in 
a controlled environment such as a dyno test or test track. 


A "customer driving cycle" may vary according to traffic patterns, route selection and dis¬ 
tance traveled, which may not allow the "diagnostic trip" to be fully completed each time 
the vehicle is operated. 


87 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 































Readiness Code 

The readiness code provides status (Yes/No) of the system having completed all the 
required monitoring functions or not. The readiness code is displayed with an aftermarket 
scan tool. The code is a binary (1/0) indicating: 

• 0=Test Completed or Not Applicable 

• 1= Test Not Complete 


A "readiness code" must be stored after any clearing of fault memory or disconnection of 
the ECM. A readiness code of "0" will be stored (see below) after a complete diagnostic 
check of all components/systems, that can turn on the “CHECK ENGINE” Light is per¬ 
formed. 

The readiness code was established to prevent anyone with an emissions related fault and 
a “CHECK ENGINE” Light on from disconnecting the battery or clearing the fault memory 
to manipulate the results of the emissions test procedure (IM 240). 

Interpretation of the Readiness Code by the ECM(s) (SAE J1979) 


The complete readiness code is equal to "one" byte (eight bits). Every bit represents one 
complete test and is displayed by the scan tool, as required by CARB/EPA. 

1 = EGR Monitoring (=0, N/A with BMW) 

0 = Oxygen Sensor Heater Monitoring 

1 = Oxygen Sensor Monitoring 
1 = Air Condition (=0, N/A with BMW) 

0 = Secondary Air Delivery Monitoring 

1 = Evaporative System Monitoring 

1 = Catalyst Heating (=0, N/A with BMW at this time). 

0 = Catalyst Efficiency Monitoring 


Drive the car in such a manner that all tests listed above can be completed (refer to the FTP 
cycle). When the complete "readiness code" equals "0" then all tests have been complet¬ 
ed and the system has established its "readiness". Accessibility of the readiness code is 
also possible using the DIS/MoDIC. 


88 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 
















OBD II Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) 

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) established the Diagnostic Trouble Codes used 
for OBD II systems (SAE J2012). The DTC’s are designed to be identified by their 
alpha/numeric structure. The SAE has designated the emission related DTC’s to start with 
the letter “P” for Powertrain related systems, hence their nickname “P-code”. 


For example: 



P-Powertrain, B-Body, C-Chassis 



DTC Source; 0-SAE, 1 -BMW - 

System; 0-Total System - 

1- Air/Fuel Induction 

2- Fuel Injection 

3- Ignition System or Misfire 

4- Auxiliary Emission Control 

5- Vehicle Speed & Idle Control 

6- Control Module Inputs/Outputs 

7- Transmission 


Sequentially numbered 
fault identifying individual 
components or circuits 
(00-99) 


• DTC’s are stored whenever the “CHECK ENGINE” Light is illuminated. 


• A requirement of CARB/EPA is providing universal diagnostic access to DTC’s via a 
standardized Diagnostic Link Connector (DLC) using a standardized tester (scan tool). 

• DTC’s only provide one set of enviromental operating conditions when a fault is stored 
This single “Freeze Frame” or snapshot refers to a block of the vehicles enviromental 
conditions for specific time when the fault first occurred. The information which is stored 
is defined by SAE and is limited in scope. This information may not even be specific to the 
type of fault. 


89 

ST055 MS41.1/MS41.2 Emissions Management 








Scan Tool Connection 

The MS41 .x has a separate OBD II Diagnostic Link Connector (DLC). The OBD II connec¬ 
tor is located in the drivers footwell to the left of the steering column (right side of center 
console on the Z3). The DLC provides access for an aftermarket scan tool to all emission 
related control systems: 

• ECM - Engine Management Monitored Emissions Functions/Components 

• TCM (AGS/EGS) - Transmission Control 

• EML - Electronic Throttle Control 


This diagnostic communication link uses the existing TXD II circuit in the vehicle through a 
separate circuit on the DLC when the 20 pin cap is installed.

Workshop Hints 


Before any service work is performed on any fuel system related component, 
always adhere to the following: 

• Observe relevent safety legislation pertaining to your area. 

• Ensure adequate ventilation. 

• Use exhaust extraction system where applicable (allivate 
fumes). 

• DO NOT SMOKE while performing fuel system repairs. 

• Always wear adequate protection clothing including eye 
protection. 

• Use caution when working around a HOT engine compartment. 

• BMW does not recommend any UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICA 
TIONS to the fuel system. The fuel systems are designed to 
comply with strict Federal Safety and Emissions Regulations. 

In the concern of product liability, it is unauthorized to sell or 
perform modifications to customer vehicles, particularly in 
safety related areas. 

• Always consult the REPAIR INSTRUCTIONS on the specific 
model you are working on before attempting a repair. 


The “CHECK ENGINE” Light can be diagnosed with an 
aftermarket Scan Tool that allows Technicians without BMW 
Special Tools or Equipment to Diagnose an emission system 
failure.

Tools and Equipment 


The DIS/Modic as well as a reputable hand held 
multimeter can be used when testing inputs/ 
components. 

It is best to make the checks at the ECM con¬ 
nection, this method includes testing the wiring 
harness. 

The correct Universal Adapter for the MS41 .x 
application should be used (#88 88 6 614 410). 
This will ensure the pin connectors and the har¬ 
ness will not be damaged. 

The interior of this Universal Adapter is shielded, 
therefore it is vital that the ground cable is con¬ 
nected to the vehicle chassis whenever the 
adapter is used. 

The adapter uses a Printed Circuit board inside 
keeping the capacitive and inductive load to a 
minimum. 


When installing the Universal Adapter to the 
ECM (located below the windshield on the pas¬ 
senger side of the engine compartment), make 
sure the ignition is switched off.

Performance Controls 


12550010.eps 



Engine Speed Signal (TD): is produced by the 
ECM as an output function. The TD signal is a 
processed square wave signal that indicates 
engine rpm. The signal is made available to 
other control modules including the Instrument 
Cluster, IHKA, EWS II and the 20 pin Diagnostic 
Socket. 

The TD output is a square wave modulated sig¬ 
nal. The frequency of the signal is directly pro¬ 
portional to RPM. The receiving control module 
detects RPM by the number of pulses. 


Load Signal (Ti): is produced by the ECM as 
an output function that represents the actual 
amount of fuel injected. It is made available to 
other control modules as an input for operation. 
These control modules include: 

• OBC = Fuel Consumption for MPG and Range 

• Instrument Cluster = MPG Gauge (Except M3) 


The Ti output is a processed square wave sig¬ 
nal. The frequency of the signal is proportional to 
engine RPM. The pulse width and duty cycle will 
vary to reflect the injection quantity.

A/C Compressor Control: is an output of the ECM. The ECM controls the A/C 
Compressor Relay based on signals from the IHKA Control Module. 

When the driver selects the “snow flake” button, the IHKA Control Module signals the ECM 
(AC) which “arms” it for compressor activation. 

The ECM prepares for the additional load of the compressor by modifying the ignition tim¬ 
ing and stabilizing idle speed. 

When A/C compressor activation is required the IHKA signals the ECM through the 
high/low refrigerant pressure switches (KO). The ECM will provide a ground circuit for the 
A/C Compressor Relay. 

The A/C Compressor Relay is deactivated during wide open throttle acceleration at low 
speeds to allow the engine to quickly achieve maximum power.

Driveaway Protection System Interface EWS II: and ECM Control Modules are syn¬ 
chronized through an individual serial number (ISN). The ISN is a unique code number 
that is permanently assigned to the ECM and also stored in the EWS II Control Module. The 
ISN must match every time the ignition is switched “ON”, before the ECM drive away pro¬ 
tection feature will be cancelled. 


• Engine Control Module designed to operate with the EWS II system will not interchange 
with ECMs from previous models. 

• The ISN replaces the BC Code input to the ECM. 

• The ISN is unique to each ECM and cannot be changed or overwritten. The ISN is transferred/ 
stored in the EWS II Control Module using the DIS/MoDIC (including diagnosis). 

• Everytime the ignition is switched “ON”, the ISN number is sent from the EWS Control Module 
to the ECM, as a digital coded signal. The numbers must match before the ECM will release 
the driveaway protection. 

• The ISN is continously sent to the ECM as long as the ignition is switched on (KL 15). 

• The ECM will disregard the loss of the ISN after the engine is running.

VANOS Control: Performance, torque, idle characteristics and exhaust emissions reduc¬ 
tion are improved by Variable Camshaft Timing (VANOS). The VANOS unit is mounted 
directly on the front of the cylinder head and adjusts the Intake camshaft timing from 
retarded to advanced. The ECM controls the operation of the VANOS solenoid which reg¬ 
ulates the oil pressure required to move the control piston. Engine RPM, load and temper¬ 
ature are used to determine VANOS activation. 

VANOS mechanical operation is dependent on engine oil pressure applied to position the 
control piston. When oil pressure is applied to the control piston (regulated by the solenoid), 
the piston moves causing the splined adjustment shaft to move. The straight splines slide 
within the camshaft sleeve. The helical splines rotate the camshaft drive sprocket changing 
the position in relation to the camshaft position which advances/retards the intake camshaft 
timing. 



The operation of the VANOS solenoid is monitored in accordance with the OBD II require¬ 
ments for emission control. The ECM monitors the final stage output control and the signal 
from the Camshaft Position Sensor for VANOS operation.

Retarded Timing: In the normal 
or off position, the spool valve in 
the piston housing is held by 
spring pressure directing the 
engine oil to the back side of the 
piston. 

This pulls the attached helical 
gear cup forward and maintains 
the late (retarded) valve timing 
position. 



13550064.tiff 


Advanced Timing: When the 
ECM provides a ground circuit to 
the solenoid, the spool valve 
pushes against the spring pres¬ 
sure diverting the pressurized 
engine oil to the front side of the 
piston. This pushes the helical 
gear cup further into the matched 
helical camshaft secondary gear 
drive. 

The angled teeth of the helical 
gears cause the pushing move¬ 
ment of the helical cup to be con¬ 
verted into a rotational movement. 
This rotational movement is 
added to the turning of the 
camshaft and causes the intake 
camshaft to “advance” 12.5 + .

Exhaust Flap Damper Control (E36): To meet European noise level compliance, the rear 
silencer incorporates a flap that is designed to reduce exhaust noise at idle, low RPM and 
while coasting. Components of the system include: 

• Exhaust Flap with Vacuum Actuator • Vacuum Reservoir 

• Switch Solenoid • Check Valve 


The ECM will power the switching solenoid and apply vacuum to the exhaust flap actuator 
to close the flap allowing additional damping of the exhaust for the following conditions: 

• Engine Idle - up to 2500 RPM 

• Engine Deceleration 


The ECM will deactivate the solenoid when accelerating above 2500 RPM. The vacuum is 
vented from the flap actuator and the flap opens. This decreases the exhaust backpressure 
for improved torque.

Throttle Position Output (DKI): 

DKI is the throttle position output 
signal to the ASC Control Module 
(if equipped). 

The DKI signal is directly propor¬ 
tional to the throttle position sen¬ 
sor input signal. 

This output signal is used by the 
ASC control module during ASC 
regulation. DKI is a pulse width 
modulated signal created by the 
ECM. 


ASC Interfaces: The ECM is 

linked to the ASC Control Module 
(if equipped) through three signal 
lines for ASC regulation. The three 
signals are switched high/low 
input requests for power reduc¬ 
tion/ drag torque reduction. 

• S-EML - Signal to the ECM of 
throttle regulation (reduce eng¬ 
ine torque during acceleration). 

• S-ASC (ZA) - Signal request to 
the ECM for fade out of ignition/ 
injection and idle rpm increase 
(further reduction in engine 
torque during acceleration).

MS 41.1 CONTROL MODULE 


• S-MSR (ZWV) - Signal request

(reduce engine torque during 
deceleration).

Auxilliary Throttle: A second throttle housing 
is mounted “upstream” of the main throttle 
housing. This auxilliary throttle is used in con¬ 
junction with ASC (if equipped). 

The throttle is normally open and is closed by 
the ASC Control Module which restricts intake 
air flow reducing engine torque to restore trac¬ 
tion/maintain stability. 


The Auxilliary Throttle is linked by a cable to the 
ADS II motor which regulates the throttle plate 
position. Activation of the ADS II motor is an out¬ 
put function of the ASC Control Module. 

The Auxilliary Throttle is closed briefly when the 
ignition is switched on “KL15” allowing the ASC 
to conduct a brief test of the ADS II motor and 
Auxilliary Throttle Position Potentiometer.. 



13550071 .jpg 



13550072.eps 


Vehicle Speed Signal: The vehicle speed input 
signal is provided by the ABS/ASC Control 
Module. The vehicle speed input is a digital 
square wave and the frequency is proportional 
to the speed of the vehicle. The speed signal is 
used for idle speed regulation and for vehicle top 
speed regulation. 

For OBD II compliance, the ECM also monitors 
the signal (as compared to engine rpm and load) 
for abrupt fluctuations in the signal frequency to 
“detect rough road surfaces” for the purpose of 
Misfire Detection plausibility.

ECM Programming - FLASH Control Modules 


The MS41 .x ECM is a programmable “FLASH” Control Module. The ECM contains a sol¬ 
dered in FLASH EPROM which can be programmed/updated up to 13 times. The 
EPROM has basic information always present in it refered to as “resident data”. This resi¬ 
dent data gives the EPROM its identification and contains instructions for the programming 
of the operational maps. When you program, you are inputting operational maps to the 
ECM such as injection timing and ignition timing, etc. 

Always refer to the latest programming IDC Bulletin for a complete list of FLASH program¬ 
mable control modules and the latest program highlights. An unprogrammed control 
module will not allow the engine to start. DME (ECM) FLASH programming is per¬ 
formed with the DIS/MoDIC using the latest software. 


Using the “automatic” determination process (preferred method), the MoDIC compares the 
part numbers stored in the FLASH EPROM of the currently installed ECM with a list of pos¬ 
sible replacement part numbers stored in the MoDIC’s memory. The comparison is done 
to: 


Display the part number for the replacement 
programmable control module for that vehicle. 


• Determine if the MoDIC can “recommend” a 
replacement part number(s) from the list part 
numbers stored in its memory. 

1 Identify a proper replacement program or 
control module.

The following signals are “manufactured” by the ECM for 
other control modules and are not the “raw” inputs to the 
ECM. 

These signals should be tested if another Control Module, 
gauge or function is inoperative due to a lack of the signal(s). 

With the 88 Pin adapter and the DIS Oscilloscope (Preset 
Measurements) the following signals can be observed with 
the ECM installed and engine running:

Tools and Equipment 


The DIS/Modic as well as a reputable hand held 
multimeter can be used when testing inputs/ 
components. 

It is best to make the checks at the ECM con¬ 
nection, this method includes testing the wiring 
harness. 

The correct Universal Adapter for the MS41 .x 
application should be used (#88 88 6 614 410). 
This will ensure the pin connectors and the har¬ 
ness will not be damaged. 

The interior of this Universal Adapter is shielded, 
therefore it is vital that the ground cable is con¬ 
nected to the vehicle chassis whenever the 
adapter is used. 

The adapter uses a Printed Circuit board inside 
keeping the capacitive and inductive load to a 
minimum. 

When installing the Universal Adapter to the 
ECM (located below the windshield on the pas¬ 
senger side of the engine compartment), make 
sure the ignition is switched off. 





VANOS 

The electrical/hydraulic function can be checked 
“statically” by using the adapter tools and shop 
supplied regulated compressed air. 

Special Tool # 90 88 6 113 450 adapts regulat¬ 
ed compressed air to substitute for engine oil 
pressure required to move the VANOS piston. 

Special Tool # 90 88 6 126 410 allows battery 
voltage and ground to activate the solenoid.
