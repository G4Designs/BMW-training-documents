ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL (EDR) 


FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION 

The electronic throttle control system (EDR) was developed specifically for the S62 engine. 
The design criteria was to develop an EML system capable of actuating the eight throttles 
while ensuring that the power potential of the S62 engine was not compromised. The three 
main components of the system include: 

• The pedal position sensor (PWG) - same component that is used on the M62 TU EML 
system. 

• The EDR motor - new component designed with the ability to control the eight throttles. 



• MS S52 engine control system - responsible for operation and monitoring of the throttle 
control system. 

The pedal position sensor is the driver’s wish for increased torque output of the engine. The 
PWG input is processed by the MS S52 control module. Plausibility checks are carried out 
and the EDR motor is operated to open the throttle valves. All eight throttle valves are 
opened simultaneously through the linkages connected to the EDR. The system requires 
approximately 120 ms to fully open the closed throttle valves. 

Feedback of the current throttle valve position is achieved through two throttle valve poten¬ 
tiometers located on the ends of the throttle valve shafts. 


6 

ST055 MS S52 















THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR (PWG) 


The PWG provides two separate variable voltage signals to the MS S52 control module for 
determining the request for EDR operation. The MS S52 monitors the changing signal 
ranges of both circuits as the pedal is pressed from idle to full throttle. 

PWG Pot #1. = 0.5V to 4.5V. 

PWG Pot #2. = 0.5V to 2.0V 

PWG Pot signal #1. is the primary input for throttle opening request. The signal from Pot 
#2. is used primarily for plausibility checking. If the signal ranges are incorrect, The MS S52 
will activate an emergency operating program based on the specific fault recognized.

ST055 MS S52 



















































EDR THROTTLE POSITION FEEDBACK SIGNALS 


The throttle valve positions are monitored by two feedback potentiometers mounted on the 
ends of the throttle valve shafts. Each potentiometer has its own power (5 volt) and ground 
supply for safety reasons. The two signals are used for redundant monitoring of the throt¬ 
tle valve positions. 

Due to their positioning on the engine, the signals from the potentiometers are inverse, 
however the MS S52 is monitoring the linear characteristics of the signal for determining 
throttle valve position. 

Checking of the potentiometer signals is split into checking each signal individually and 
comparing the two signal values. 

Different emergency operating programs are activated depending on what fault might occur 
with the feedback signal circuits as follows: 

• Emergency program #1. - Error while checking signal comparison. 

• Emergency program #1. - Fault with one potentiometer signal or sensor. 

• Emergency program #2. - Fault with both potentiometer signals or sensors.

ST055 MS S52 




EDR SAFETY CONCEPT 


A pre-drive check of the EDR system is carried out every time the ignition is switched On 
(KL 15). The MS S52 control module briefly opens the throttles and checks the following: 

• The zero set point of the feedback potentiometers - throttle valve closed position. 

• Free movement of the throttle valves. 

• Operation of the EDR actuator motor. 

• Operation of the return springs in the EDR actuator motor. 


EMERGENCY PROGRAMS 

There are a total of four emergency operation programs stored in the MS S52 control mod¬ 
ule. The MS S52 control module will activate one of these programs depending on which 
fault is present or what the failed component is. With any fault that is relevant to the EDR 
system, the engine’s output torque will be reduced to provide limited driveability of the vehi¬ 
cle. 

EMERGENCY PROGRAM #1. - Engine operation with PWG input. The engine’s output 
torque is limited to 480 Nm. This program will set with faults in one PWG sensor input or 
one throttle valve feedback input. 

EMERGENCY PROGRAM #2. - Engine operation through the idle valve actuator. The 
engine’s output torque is limited to 300 Nm and the vehicle’s speed to 70 MPH. With pro¬ 
gram #2, the throttle valves are shut down and only the idle valve is used for engine oper¬ 
ation. This program will set with a fault in one air mass sensor input and one PWG sensor 
input. 

EMERGENCY PROGRAM #3. - Engine operation with jammed throttle valves. The engine’s 
output torque is limited to 300 Nm and the speed is limited to 35 MPH. This is carried out 
through ignition and injection intervention if the MS S52 senses that the throttle valves are 
jammed or stuck and cannot be closed by applying power through the EDR actuator. 

EMERGENCY PROGRAM #4. - Engine operation with a control module internal fault. The 
engine’s output torque is limited to 250 NM and the speed is limited to 35 MPH. Depending 
on the degree of the fault, the control module with the dual processors will enable limited 
engine operation.

CRUISE CONTROL OPERATION 


As with other EML systems, the MS S52 control module 
takes over the function of cruise control. Throttle activation 
is provided by the MS S52 automatic control of the EDR 
actuator and monitoring of the feedback potentiometers. 

All driver requested cruise control function requests are pro¬ 
vided to the MS S52 from the MFL control module in the 
steering wheel over a single FGR data lead. 



BRAKE/CLUTCH SWITCH INPUTS 


The brake and clutch switch signals are input to the MS S52 control module for cruise con¬ 
trol operation.

IDLE CONTROL SYSTEM (ZWD 5) 


Idle control on the S62 engine is carried out using the ZWD 5 idle control valve. The valve 
features a second air supply system that functions independently from the throttle control 
system. The idle valve draws in metered air from the intake plenum and it is connected to 
both sets of throttle valves though an interconnected pipe. 

The valve receives power from the main relay and the open and close windings are con¬ 
trolled by the MS S52 control module. Without power, the valve is open approximately 30%. 

Under certain conditions, the idle control valve can be opened by the control module to pro¬ 
vide air flow for emergency (limp home) operation. 




ST055 MS S52 





INPUT SIGNALS/COMPONENTS 


POWER SUPPLY AND GROUNDS 

The MS S52 control module receives the following power supply inputs: 

• KL 30 - Constant Battery power. The ECM receives KL 30 from the battery to monitor 
the voltage level as an input and adjusts output functions if the battery voltage drops 
below a certain threshold. 

• KL 15 - Ignition Key On. The MS S52 control module receives KL 15 for its wake up call 
and for activation of the engine control module relay. 

• KL 15 - Main Relay (engine control relay) Power Supply. The ECM receives its operation 
from the main relay once the relay is energized by the ECM.

CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSORS 

Located on the rear of the cylinder head, the camshaft position sensors (Hall effect) moni¬ 
tor the position of the camshafts to establish start of ignition firing order, setup sequential 
fuel injection triggering and for accurate camshaft advance and retard (double VANOS) tim¬ 
ing feedback. 

With full variable VANOS control on both the intake and exhaust camshafts, four cam posi¬ 
tion sensors are required. 

The sensors are provided with operating power from the ECM main relay and produce a 
square wave input signal to the ECM. The trigger wheels contain a wide tooth that is used 
to establish full sequential injection. 



13 

ST055 MS S52 





CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR 


The engine speed (RPM) and crankshaft position input signals are provided by the induc¬ 
tive pulse sensor that scans the incremental gear wheel mounted on the flywheel of the 
engine. The rotation of the gear wheel generates an A/C voltage signal in the sensor where¬ 
by each tooth of the wheel produces one pulse. The engine control module counts these 
pulses and determines engine speed and crankshaft position. 

The signal from the crankshaft sensor is also used for OBD II monitoring for misfire detec¬ 
tion. 




ST055 MS S52 







HOT FILM AIR MASS SENSOR 


The MS S52 system uses the hot film air mass sensor for measuring the air intake volume. 
Two air mass sensors are used with the M5 engine to ensure that an sufficient volume of 
air can enter the engine under full load operating conditions. 

The operation of the hot film air mass sensor remains the same as previous systems. The 
sensor receives operating power from the ECM relay. 



INTAKE AIR TEMPERATURE 

Intake air density (temperature) for injection is automatically compensated for by the air 
mass sensors. 

However, an additional air temperature (NTC) function is required for ignition timing.The 
sensing function is integrated into the driver’s side air mass meter and provides a signal 
dependent on air temperature. 


15 

ST055 MS S52 






ENGINE COOLANT TEMPERATURE SENSOR 


The engine coolant temperature (NTC) input to the control module is used to provide 
enrichment for cold starts and cold engine running conditions. The sensor is located near 
the thermostat housing. 

The oil temperature sensor input is used as a replacement value in the event of a failure 
with the coolant temperature sensor input.

ijuuuuuuuui_ 


Oil Temperature/Level Sensor: The electronic level sensor is located in the engine sump 
mounted to the engine oil pan. The probe of the level sensor contains two temperature 
sensing elements. 


• One senses the engine oil temperature. 


• The other is heated to 10° C above the temperature of the engine and then is allowed to 
cool. 


The length of time it takes to cool the heated element is how the sensor determines the 
engine oil level. When the oil level is high it covers a larger portion of the probe submersed 
in the oil sump. The engine oil around the probe absorbs the heat of the heated element 
quicker than if the level is low. 

The microporcessor in the base of the sensor produces a pulse width modulated signal 
proportional to the oil level. The pulse width increases with a decreased level of oil. 

Based on the oil temperature, the visual warning LEDs in the tachometer will illuminate at 
cold engine start up and slowly be extinguished as the oil temperature increases. One 
amber and the red LEDs always stay illuminated reminding the driver of maximum rpm 
zone. The oil temp sensor also serves as a vital input for VANOS operation, varying the sole¬ 
noid control based on oil temperature (reaction time of camshaft movement). In the event 
of a fault the engine coolant temperature is used as a substitute value.

THROTTLE PROGRESSION SWITCH 


The MS S52 control system contains two different throttle progression program curves 
(Sport and Normal). The sport program is selected by pressing the sport switch located in 
the center console switch panel. 

The switch provides a ground signal as an input when pressed. The MS S52 activates the 
sport characteristics for the EDR throttle control. This provides an increase in throttle open¬ 
ing over the non-sport position. 

At the same time the ZKE control module is signaled over the CAN and K-Bus to activate 
the sport servotronic (increased road feel) steering characteristic program. 



18 

ST055 MS S52 






POWER TRANSMISSION SWITCH 


The power transmission switch (circuit) consists of two switches in series. The circuit 
includes a clutch switch and a gear selector switch on the transmission. The functions of 
the power transmission switch are as follows: 

• Cutout for cruise control operation 

• Enable condition for idle control 

The switches provide a high signal for the MS S52 when the clutch is disengaged and the 
transmission is in gear. 

If either the clutch is engaged or the transmission is in neutral, the cruise control will be dis¬ 
engaged.

ST055 MS S52 





OXYGEN SENSORS 

Four oxygen sensors are used on the MS S52 as with other engine management systems. 
Two oxygen sensors, mounted in front of the catalytic converters and two sensors are 
mounted behind the converters to monitor the efficiency of the catalyst. 

The two pre-converter oxygen sensors monitor the air fuel mixture and their inputs are 
used to adjust the mixture to achieve the ideal air/fuel ratio for all driving conditions. When 
heated, the oxygen sensor generates a voltage based on the oxygen content differential 
between the exhaust gas and the ambient air. The greater the oxygen differential, the high¬ 
er the voltage generated will be. The oxygen sensor swing in voltage ranges from 0.15V 
(Lean) to 0.85V (Rich). 


The two post-converter oxygen sensors monitor the oxygen level after the conversion by 
the catalyst. This signal is relatively steady at approximately 0.8V. The engine control mod¬ 
ule compares the signals of the pre and post oxygen sensors for conversion efficiency and 
if the values go outside of the programmed parameters, faults will be stored relating to cat¬ 
alytic converter operation. 



20 

ST055 MS S52 





KNOCK SENSORS 


The use of knock sensors allows the MS S52 control module to maintain the optimum igni¬ 
tion timing curve for all engine operating conditions. If detonation occurs, the signal from 
the knock sensors allows the engine control module to retard the timing to prevent engine 
damage. 

Each knock sensor produces a varying voltage signal that is dependent on the level of noise 
produced by the cylinders. This voltage signal input is processed by the control module and 
if the level exceeds the programmed parameters for knock, the timing is retarded until the 
knock is eliminated.

CATALYTIC CONVERTER TEMPERATURE MONITORING 


The M5 is equipped with an exhaust temperature sensor at the catalyst for cylinder bank 
5-8. The sensor is a PTC resistor which allows the MS S52 to monitor the catalyst tem¬ 
perature. This input is considered for mixture control by the MS S52 for catalyst efficiency. 
In the event of an overheat situation, the ECM will illuminate the Malfunction Indicator Light 
(MIL) and set a fault code. Under certain load conditions, the fuel mixture is enriched to aid 
in cooling down the catalytic converters.

INTEGRATED AMBIENT BAROMETRIC PRESSURE SENSOR 


The MS S52 Control module contains an integral ambient barometric pressure sensor. The 
sensor is part of the SKE and is not serviceable. The internal sensor is supplied with 5 volts 
In return the sensor provides a linear voltage of approximately 2.4 to 4.5 volts representa¬ 
tive of barometric pressure (altitude). 

The MS S52 monitors barometric pressure for the following reasons: 

* The barometric pressure signal along with calculated air mass provides an additional 
correction factor to further refine injection “on” time. 


* Provides a base value to calculate the air mass being injected into the exhaust system by 
the secondary air injection system. This correction factor alters the secondary air injection 
“on” time, optimizing the necessary air flow into the exhaust system. 


* Recognition of altitude above the accepted criteria postponing DM-TL activation for evap¬ 
orative emission leak diagnosis.

OUTPUTS/Components 


MAIN RELAY CONTROL 

The MS S52 control module activates the main relay when KL 15 is switched ON. This pro¬ 
vides operating power for the control module and in addition the following systems/circuits 
also receive operating power from the main relay: 

• Traction control module 

• Fuel pump relay 

• Secondary air pump relay/air pump 

• E-box cooling fan 

• Auxiliary oil pump solenoids 

• Purge valve 

• Fuel injectors 

• Vanos solenoids 

• Oxygen sensor heaters 

• Air mass sensors 

• Idle control valve 


The MS S52 maintains the ground for the main relay for a short duration after the ignition 
has been switched off. This allows the control module to store the adaption values and any 
fault codes. 



ST055 MS S52 




FUEL PUMP MODULE 


The MS S52 controls the activation of the fuel pump module. After the ignition is switched 
ON, the MS S52 provides a pulse width modulated ground for the fuel pump module and 
the ground is maintained with the presence of the engine speed signal. 

A new fuel pump is utilized to match the fuel supply demands of the S 62 engine. While 
the pump delivers more volume and pressure, this creates more heat due to the increased 
power consumption. To lower the in-tank temperature, the fuel pump module will vary the 
pump speed (amperage). The MS S52 control module will vary the ground signal (PWM) 
to the fuel pump module. This variation is based on engine speed and load: 

• Idle and part load = low pump speed 

• Start-up (20 seconds) and full-load = full pump speed 


The power to the fuel pump relay will be switched off in the event of an airbag activation. 
The MRS III control module will signal the Engine control module over K-bus and CAN bus 
for this purpose.

NON RETURN FUEL RAIL SYSTEM 

The S62 engine utilizes the same method of meeting 
Running Loss Compliance as previously seen on the 
M62 TU. The regulated fuel supply is controlled by the 
fuel pressure regulator integrated in the fuel filter 
assembly (pressure testing tap at this point). A fuel 
return line is located on the filter/regulator assembly. 
The system provides even fuel distribution to all fuel 
injectors due to a “T” connection feeding both fuel 
rails. The new fuel rails do not contain a return line.

E BOX FAN CONTROL 


The E Box fan is controlled by the MS S52. The control module contains an integral NTC 
temperature sensor for the purpose of monitoring the E Box temperature and activating the 
fan. 

When the temperature of the E Box exceeds predetermined values, MS S52 provides a 
switched ground for the E Box fan to cool the E Box located control modules. 

With every engine start-up, MS S52 briefly activates the fan ensuring continued fan motor 
operation for the service life of the vehicle. This feature is intended to prevent fan motor 
“lock up” from lack of use.

SECONDARY AIR INJECTION 


The secondary air injection system consists of the same components as previous systems 
with V8 specific locations. 


The MS S52 control unit controls the vacuum vent valve and the secondary air injection 
pump relay separately but simultaneously. 

The secondary air pump operates at a start temperature of between 10°C and 40°C. It con¬ 
tinues to operate for a max. of 2 minutes at idle speed. 

MS S52 contributes an additional correction factor for secondary air “on” time with the 
additional input from the integral ambient barometric pressure sensor. 

This sensor provides a base value to calculate the air mass being injected into the exhaust 
system. This helps to “fine tune” the secondary air injection “on” time, optimizing the nec¬ 
essary air flow into the exhaust system which reduces the time to catalytic converter light- 
off.

AUXILIARY FAN CONTROL 


The Auxiliary Fan motor incorporates an output final stage that activates the fan motor at 
variable speeds. The auxiliary fan is controlled by the MS S52. The motor output stage 
receives power and ground and activates the motor based on a PWM signal (10 - 100 Hz) 
received from the MS S52. 


The fan is activated based on the following factors: 


• Radiator outlet temperature sensor input exceeds a preset temperature. 

• IHKA signalling via the K and CAN bus based on calculated refrigerant pressures. 

• Vehicle speed. 

• Battery voltage level. 


When the over temperature light in the instrument cluster is on (120°C) the fan is run in the 
overrun function. This signal is provided to the ECM via the CAN bus. When this occurs 
the fan is run at a frequency of 10 Hz.

VANOS SOLENOID CONTROL 


Control of the VANOS solenoids is an output function of the MS S52 control module. There 
is an inlet and exhaust solenoid for each camshaft. These solenoids are both installed on 
one side of the control piston. The engine control module regulates the solenoids through 
a pulse width modulated signal to apply or drain control oil pressure from the VANOS pis¬ 
tons. 

Camshaft adjustment is based on several characteristic maps stored in the control module. 
The main control parameters for camshaft adjustment are derived from the the engine 
speed signal and the throttle valve position signal. 



29 

ST055 MS S52 


OIL SUMP CHANGEOVER VALVES 


The oil supply system of the S62B50 engine is specifically designed for the M5, due to its 
ability for high speed cornering (transverse acceleration of up tol .2g) that could cause the 
engine oil to be forced (and trapped) into the outer edge of the cylinder head and the rear 
area of the oil sump. To prevent oil starvation from occurring during these driving situations, 
two additional scavenging oil pumps are installed within the main oil pump housing. The 
main oil pump’s function is to supply the engine with the required volume of oil for all of its 
lubrication needs. The two additional pumps only supply the oil sump with the scavenged 
oil. 

Each additional oil pump incorporates a solenoid changeover valve that is connected to two 
scavenging tubes that pickup from the rear section of the oil pan and the outer edge of the 
cylinder head. The scavenging tubes in the oil pan crossover so that the right side pump 
draws from the rear left side of the pan and the left pump from the right side of the pan. 

When cornering at forces > 0.9g, the MS S52 will switch one solenoid to draw oil from the 
cylinder head while the second solenoid will continue to draw oil from the rear of the 
pan.The MS S52 control module receives the G-force signal from the DSC control module 
over the CAN line.

INJECTOR CONTROL 


The MS S52 control module calculates the correct injection time based on the control 
parameters of: 

• Engine speed 

• Air mass 

• Throttle position 

• Oxygen Sensor feedback signal 

• Engine coolant 

• Barometric pressure 

• Battery voltage 

• Catalyst Temperature Sensor 

The injectors receive operating power from the main relay and the control module provides 
the ground for the duration of the injection time (MS value). 



31 

ST055 MS S52 





IGNITION COIL TRIGGERING 


Control of the ignition coils is an output function of the MS S52 control module. The sys¬ 
tem is 100% solid state with no moving parts. The control module triggers each coil indi¬ 
vidually based on the parameters of engine speed and crankshaft position. 

The ignition timing can be modified between each individual coil firing and can also be 
adjusted on a cylinder selective basis for knock control. 

The power supply for the ignition coils is provided by a relay. This relay is identified as an 
“unloader relay” in the ETM and component listing displays. 

The unloader relay was integrated into all vehicles starting with the 1997 model year. The 
purpose of this relay is to isolate the voltage supply as well as to relieve the ignition switch 
of the additional current draw needed by the ignition coils. 

When KL 15 is switched on, the relay control circuit is provided power to close the relay 
providing operating voltage to ignition coils.

OXYGEN SENSOR HEATING 


Oxygen sensor heating is an output function of the MS S52 control module. The heating 
circuits receive operating power from the main relay when KL 15 is switched on. Each of 
the heaters is controlled through a separate final stage which is monitored by the control 
module for OBD II purposes. 

The heaters are controlled with a pulsed square wave voltage during cold start which allows 
heating to occur without the result of thermo-shock. The duty cycle is then varied to main¬ 
tain the heating of the sensors. On decel, the duty cycle will be increased to maintain the 
heating of the sensors during closed throttle operation with fuel cut.

IDLE CONTROL VALVE 

The S62 engine uses an idle control valve for idle stabilization. During idle conditions, the 
throttle valves are closed and all idle air passes through the idle valve. The valve on the S62 
engine is the three wire ZWD 5 system. 

The valve has two windings that oppose each other. By varying the duty cycle applied to 
the windings, the valve can be progressively opened, closed or held steady to maintain the 
idle at a specified speed. The valve has a mechanical fail-safe opening (30%) which will 
allow the engine to idle in the event of a malfunction with the control of the valve. 

The idle control valve also serves as a fail-safe in the event of certain faults with the throt¬ 
tle control system (EDR). The MS S52 control module can progressively open the valve to 
allow limited operation of the engine.

PURGE CONTROL VALVE 


The MS S52 system uses a purge valve that is sprung closed and powered open. This type 
of purge valve is required for OBD II compliancy and evaporative system leak detection 
tests. This type of valve also prevents vapors escaping into the atmosphere when the vehi¬ 
cle is not in use. The valve will not open under fuel vapor over pressure. 

The valves are cycled periodically during engine operation. The duty cycle of the purge 
valve solenoid may vary between 0 and 100% depending on engine operating conditions. 

The evaporative purge system is monitored for flow check after fuel system adaptation is 
complete and the ECM oxygen sensor feedback is in closed loop. The diagnosis starts dur¬ 
ing normal purge operation. After the system has completed a purge cycle, the valve is 
cycled abruptly several times. In addition to the rich/lean shift, the engine idle speed will 
vary. If the predetermined values are reached, the system is functioning properly. 

The flow check will operate after the following conditions have been met: 

• Vehicle speed = 0 • Oxygen sensors in closed loop 

• Engine at idle speed • Coolant temperature above set limit

DM-TL (DIAGNOSIS MODULE - TANK LEAKAGE) 


A new Fuel System Leak Diagnosis Pump is equipped on the M5. The pump will eventu¬ 
ally replace the current vacuum LDP on all vehicles. 


The pump is manufactured by Bosch to BMW specifications. 


• Bosch ECMs identify the electrical function of the pump as DM-TL. 


• Siemens ECMs identify the electrical function as “LDP-M1”

Functional Overview: 


The DM-TL is located in the drivers side rear wheel well in the M5. 


1. In it’s inactive state, filtered fresh air enters the evaporative system through the sprung 
open valve of the DM-TL. 

2. When the DME activates the DM-TL for leak testing, it first activates only the pump 
motor. This pumps air through a restricter orifice (1.0 or 0.5 mm) which causes the elec¬ 
tric motor to draw a specific amperage value. This value is equivalent to the size of the 
restricter. 

3. The solenoid valve is then energized which seals the evap system and directs the pump 
output to pressurize the evap system. 


The evap system is detected as having a large leak if the amperage value is not realized, a 
small leak if the same reference amperage is realized or no leak if the amperage value is 
higher than the reference amperage.

FUNCTION 


The DC Motor LDP ensures accurate fuel system leak detection for leaks as small as 
1,0mm (.040”). The pump contains an integral DC motor which is activated directly by the 
engine control module. The ECM monitors the pump motor operating current as the meas¬ 
urement for detecting leaks. 

The pump also contains an ECM controlled change over valve that is energized closed dur¬ 
ing a Leak Diagnosis test. The change over valve is open during all other periods of oper¬ 
ation allowing the fuel system to “breath” through the inlet filter (similar to the full down 
stroke of the current vacuum operated LDP). 



DC MOTOR LDP INACTIVE - NORMAL PURGE VALVE OPERATION 


In it’s inactive state the pump motor and the change over valve of the DC Motor LDP are 
not energized. When purge valve operation occurs filtered air enters the fuel system com¬ 
pensating for engine vacuum drawing on the hydrocarbon vapors stored in the charcoal 
canister.

LEAK DIAGNOSIS TEST PRECONDITIONS 


The ECM only initiates a leak diagnosis test every second time the criteria are met. The cri¬ 
teria is as follows: 

• Engine OFF with ignition switched OFF. 

• Engine Control Module still in active state or what is known as “follow up mode” (Main 
Relay energized, control module and ECM components online for extended period after 
key off). 

• Prior to Engine/Ignition switch OFF condition, vehicle must have been driven for a min¬ 
imum of 20 minutes. 

• Prior to minimum 20 minute drive, the vehicle must have been OFF for a minimum of 5 
hours. 

• Fuel Tank Capacity must be between 15 and 85% (safe approximation between 1/4 - 
3/4 of a tank). 

• Ambient Air Temperature between -7°C & 35°C (20°F & 95°F) 

• Altitude < 2500m (8,202 feet). 

• Battery Voltage between 11.5 and 14.5 Volts 

When these criteria are satisfied every second time, the ECM will start the Fuel System Leak 
Diagnosis Test. The test will typically be carried out once a day ie:, once after driving to 
work in the morning, when driving home in the evening, the criteria are once again met but 
the test is not initiated. The following morning, the test will run again.

LEAK DIAGNOSIS TEST 


PHASE 1 - REFERENCE MEASUREMENT 

The ECM activates the pump motor. The pump pulls air from the filtered air inlet and pass¬ 
es it through a precise 0.5mm reference orifice in the pump assembly. 

The ECM simultaneously monitors the pump motor current flow . The motor current raises 
quickly and levels off (stabilizes) due to the orifice restriction. The ECM stores the stabilized 
amperage value in memory. The stored amperage value is the electrical equivalent of a 0.5 
mm (0.020”) leak.

PHASE 2 - LEAK DETECTION 


The ECM energizes the Change Over Valve allowing the pressurized air to enter the fuel sys¬ 
tem through the Charcoal Canister, The ECM monitors the current flow and compares it 
with the stored reference measurement over a duration of time. 



Once the test is concluded, the ECM stops the pump motor and immediately de-energizes 
the change over valve. This allows the stored pressure to vent thorough the charcoal can¬ 
ister trapping hydrocarbon vapor and venting air to atmosphere through the filter.

TEST RESULTS 


The time duration varies between 45 & 270 seconds depending on the resulting leak diag¬ 
nosis test results (developed tank pressure “amperage” / within a specific time period).
