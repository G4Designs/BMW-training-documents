M5.2.1 (1998 MY M73 & M62 equipped vehicles) 

Purpose of the System 


The M5.2.1 engine control system is manufac¬ 
tured by Bosch to BMW specifications. In addi¬ 
tion to quality improvement modifications, 
emphasis was placed on enhancing functions 
for OBD II and Tier 1 compliance. 



M5.2.1 control modules utilize the 
SKE (standard shell construction 
housing). The SKE utilizes a modu¬ 
lar connector configuration. There 
are a total of 5 connectors provid¬ 
ing a combined total of 134 pins. 



(9 pins) (24 pins) (52 pins) (40 pins) (9 pins) 


The modular harness connectors are color 
coded by cylinder bank on the M73. When 
removing control modules from the E-Box, note 
the color of the plugs and mark each module to 
prevent incorrect replacement. This step is 
important to prevent EWS III (3.3) ISN incom¬ 
patibility. 



The correct Universal Adapter for the M5.2.1 
application should be used (#90 88 6 121 300). 
This will ensure the pin connectors and the har¬ 
ness will not be damaged.

IGNITION COIL POWER SUPPLY (Unloader) RELAY 


The power supply for the ignition coils is provided by a relay. This relay is identified as an 
“unloader relay” in the ETM and component listing displays. 

The unloader relay was integrated into all vehicles starting with the 1997 model year. The 
purpose of this relay is to isolate the voltage supply as well as relieving the ignition switch 
of the additional current draw needed by the ignition coils. 

When KL15 is switched on, the relay control circuit is provided power to close the relay pro¬ 
viding operating voltage to ignition coils.

SHROUDED FUEL INJECTOR AIR CONTROL (M73 Equipped Vehicles only) 


In compliance with emission regulations, air shrouded injectors are used on the M73 with 
M5.2.1. This system allows additional metered air to be drawn into the combustion cham¬ 
ber thus lowering CO/HC emissions. 

With the air routing through the 
injector, it also creates additional 
turbulence to help atomize the 
fuel mixture. 


The system is ECM controlled 
and uses the following compo¬ 
nents: 


• 2 Air Containment solenoids for 
air inlet to the fuel injectors. 

AIR MIXED WITH FUEL AT THE 

PINTLE OPENING TO IMPROVE ATOMIZATION. 

• Vacuum “balancing” bleeds to 
the intake manifolds. 

OPERATION 



METERED AIR 
INTRODUCED 
INTO INJECTOR 
SHROUD 


Operation of the system begins on cold engine 
start up. The ECMs provide a ground path to 
open the valves allowing additional metered air 
to be drawn into the fuel injectors to the mani¬ 
fold. 

If the vehicle is stationary and idling, this process 
continues until the engine coolant temperature 
reaches 75°C. If the vehicle is started and driven, 
the additional air is injected through the warm up 
phase of the engine. The ECM then releases the 
ground path so the valves spring closed. 



NOTE: Air injection will be interrupted during idle at engine operating temperature, if the idle 
speed becomes too high! 


Similar to the M62, a brake booster is linked into the system by the vacuum amplifier. On 
the M73 this requires an equal “balance” of vacuum bleed on the opposite bank allowing 
equal DK motor synchronization. This system has fault recognition and is diagnosible using 
the DIS.

BATTERY CHARGE LOGIC 


The 5.2.1 ECM (ECM 1 on the M73) monitors the “system voltage” from voltage supply 
inputs. 


The following situations will occur upon engine start up: 

• If the charging system output is sufficient, the engine rpm will be normal. 

• If the charging system output is lower than normal, the engine idle will increase to pro¬ 
vide a higher charge capability of the alternator. 

M62: The ECM opens the idle control valve slightly. 

M73: ECM I will request via “CAN bus” that the EML control module increase the 
engine rpm. 


Engine idle speed will be raised to 900 RPM until the generator output is sufficient,

EVAPORATIVE FUEL SYSTEM PRESSURE LEAK DIAGNOSIS 


To meet Tier 1 (emission stage) 
compliancy, a Leak Diagnosis 
Pump (LDP) is installed for fuel sys¬ 
tem evaporative leak testing. 

This system with the LDP is capa¬ 
ble of detecting a leak as small as 
0.5 mm. 

The LDP is located in the left rear 
(driver’s side) fender well. The 
LDP is a unitized component that 
contains the following: 

• Vacuum chamber 

• Pneumatic pump chamber 

• DME activated vacuum sole¬ 
noid 

• Reed switch providing a 
switched voltage feedback 
signal to the DME.

LDP-PURGE SYSTEM INTEGRATION 


• The function of the LDP is to pressurize the fuel tank and the evaporative emission sys¬ 
tem (approx. 25mb.) for the purpose of detecting leaks. 

• The canister vent valve is integrated into the LDP which is electrically controlled by the 
ECM. The canister vent valve is sprung open to provide fresh air entry into the fuel sys¬ 
tem during purge operation. 


• Purge operation characteristics are: 


Off Idle through Full Throttle: Purge Valve(s) opened by pulse width modulated con¬ 
trol of the ECM(s). Duty cycle varied by engine operating conditions. 

Warm Idle: Purge valve(s) open slightly 

Cold Idle/Decel: Engine temp < 67°C, Purge valve(s) closed.

• During diagnostic testing of the evaporative emission system, the vent valve is closed

LDP OPERATION 


During every engine cold start, the following occurs: 


• The LDP solenoid is energized by the ECM 


Engine manifold vacuum enters the upper chamber of the LDP to lift up the spring 
loaded diaphragm pulling ambient air through the filter and into the lower chamber of 
the LDP through the one way valve.

• The solenoid is then de-energized, spring pressure closes the vacuum port blocking the 
engine vacuum and simultaneously opens the vent port to the balance tube which 
releases the captive vacuum in the upper chamber. 


• This allows the compressed spring to push the diaphragm down, starting the “limited 
down stroke”. 



ST055 M5.2.1 
















































































































































































































































• The air that was drawn into the lower chamber of the LDP during the upstroke is forced 
out of the lower chamber and into the evaporative system. 


• This electrically controlled repetitive up/down stroke is cycled repeatedly building up a 
total pressure of approximately +25mb in the evaporative system. 


• After sufficient pressure has built up (LDP and its cycling is calibrated to the vehicle), the 
leak diagnosis begins and lasts about 100 seconds.

• The upper chamber contains an integrated reed switch that produces a switched high- 
low voltage signal that is monitored by the ECM. The switch is opened by the magnetic 
interruption of the metal rod connected to the diaphragm when in the diaphragm is in 
the top dead center position. 

• The repetitive up/down stroke is confirmation to the ECM that the valve is functioning.

The ECM also monitors the length of time it takes for the reed switch to open, which is 
opposed by pressure under the diaphragm in the lower chamber. The LDP is still cycled, 
but at a frequency that depends upon the rate of pressure loss in the lower chamber. 


If the pumping frequency is below parameters, there is no leak present. 


If the pumping frequency is above parameters, this indicates sufficient pressure can not 
build up in the lower chamber and evaporative system, indicating a leak.

A fault code can be recorded by each ECM indicating an evaporative system leak. Upon 
test completion, the ECM releases the ground path to the LDP and the internal spring push¬ 
es the diaphragm for the “full down stroke”. 


At bottom dead center, the diaphragm rod opens the canister vent valve. This allows for 
fresh air intake from the filter for normal purge system operation. The LDP is diagnosible 
with the DIS including a service function activation test.

The chart represents the diagnostic leak testing time frame in seconds. When the ignition 
is switched on, the ECM performs a “static check” of circuit integrity to the LDP pump 
including the reed switch.

TIME (seconds) 


• On cold engine start up, the pump is activated for the first 27 seconds at approximate¬ 
ly 166-200 Hz. This rapid pumping phase is required to pressurize the evaporative 
components. 

• Once pressurized, the build up phase then continues from 27-38 seconds. The ECM 
monitors the system through the reed switch to verify that pressure has stabilized. 

• The measuring phase for leak diagnosis lasts from 38-63 seconds. The pump is acti¬ 
vated but due to the pressure build up under the diaphragm, the pump moves slower. 
If the pump moves quickly, this indicates a lack of pressure or a leak. This registers as 
a fault in the ECM’s. 

• From 63-100 seconds the pump is deactivated, allowing full down stroke of the 
diaphragm and rod. At the extreme bottom of rod travel, the canister vent valve is 
pushed open relieving pressure and allowing normal purge operation when needed. 



ST055 M5.2.1 







































































ORVR FUNCTION (On-board Refueling Vapor Recovery) 


Any vehicle fitted with the LDP is also ORVR compliant. The ORVR system addresses 
recovering fuel vapor which is released during refueling. Previously, fuel vapors were vent¬ 
ed from the tank venting line back to the filler neck and in many states reclaimed by a vac¬ 
uum receiver on the filling station’s fuel pump nozzle. 

ORVR provides a means to “capture” these hydrocarbon vapors resulting from the rush of 
fuel into the tank during fuel filling. The following changes were installed to achieve this: 

• Re-routing the previous tank vent hose from the filler neck to the liquid/vapor separator. 
This hose was also enlarged to accommodate the increased “vapor flow” being intro¬ 
duced into the liquid vapor separator. 

• Enlarging the rollover valve and the hose from the liquid/vapor separator to the charcoal 
canister. 

• Modified filler neck which allows a higher flow rate. 

• Modifications to the fuel tank to form a liquid seal during refueling - forcing vapors to the 
liquid/vapor separator. 


When refueling, the pressure of the fuel entering the tank will force the hydrocarbon vapors 
through the tank vent line to the liquid/vapor separator, through the rollover valve and into 
the charcoal canister. The hydrocarbons are stored in the charcoal canister, and the system 
can then “breathe” through the LDP pump and the air filter. 


The small hose at the fuel filler neck is still required to check for leaks at the filler cap.

EWS III (3.3) 

The EWS III is modified for compatibility with the M5.2.1 engine control system and is des¬ 
ignated as EWS 3.3. 

EWS 3.3 is installed in the 1998 MY E38 (from 5/97 production) and 1998 MY E39 (from 
9/97 production). The system inputs remain unchanged compared with the 3.2 system, 
however, the ISN signal is now a “Rolling Code ISN”. 




ST055 M5.2.1 




























































































ROLLING CODE OPERATION 


The “rolling code” is a one way signal from the EWS 3.3 to the ECM. The “Rolling Code” 
provides a higher level of sophistication than the ISN of previous EWS systems. Similar to 
the data exchange between the EWS control module and the transponder chip in each key, 
the “rolling code” is different every time the engine is started. 

The rolling code system requires that each vehicle receive a unique “Rolling Code Table”. 
The rolling code table is assigned and installed by the factory into both the EWS 3.3 and 
M5.2.1 control modules. The code tables are “burned” into the control modules and can 
not be overwritten by ZCS encoding software, ECM programming software or the 
EWS/ECM Alignment Procedure of the Service Function section in the DIS for each system. 

ENGINE STARTING PROCEDURE 

• All EWS 3.3 input requirements are met: 

- System power and grounds provided 

- Positive data exchange between the key and EWS control module (key accepted). 

- BC code function is not active. 

- Range selector in P or N (E38s and 540iA), or Clutch pedal depressed (540i Sport). 

• EWS 3.3 control module closes the internal relay contacts providing the KL50 Start sig¬ 
nal to the starter solenoid. Simultaneously, it calculates a stored code from the rolling 
code table and sends the calculated results to the ECM. 

• On receipt of EWS’s calculated results, ECM calculates it’s own stored code and com¬ 
pares it’s results with the received results from EWS. 

- Results Identical: Engine Starts! 

- Results not identical: ECM “rolls forward” to the next code in the rolling code table 
and calculates it. It continues to “roll forward” until it finds a match. If no match is 
found: Engine cranks but does not start! 

The “forward roll” occurs up to a maximum of 200 times. This is necessary for the fol¬ 
lowing reason. Example scenario: ECM is temporarily disconnected for service rea¬ 
sons. The ignition key is inadvertently switched on. When switched back off, the EWS 
is advanced one “rolling code” ahead of the ECM because the ECM was not connect¬ 
ed. Once reconnected and the ignition key is turned to start, the ECM advances until a 
match is found. The rolling codes in each module are once again synchronized. 

• When the ignition is switched off and no engine RPM signal is present in either the ECM 
and EWS, each module will automatically “roll forward” to the next pre-determined code 
(based on the code table.) This code is used for the next start sequence.

SERVICE INFORMATION 


• Rolling code tables are rigidly assigned. For this reason, ECM control modules can not 
be swapped from another vehicle and re-aligned for troubleshooting purposes. 

• Replacement EWS 3.3 control modules are ordered VIN specifically. They are received 
with the same rolling code table as the original module. Once ZCS encoded, the DIS 
software “resets” the current rolling code in the DME back to rolling code #1, providing 
synchronization in both modules. 

• Replacement ECM control modules are “off the shelf parts” and are “blank”. After ECM 
programming, the DIS software informs the EWS control module that a new ECM has 
been installed. With this information the EWS will send the entire rolling code table to 
the ECM on the next key on condition. It also resets itself to rolling code #1. The DIS 
software then informs the ECM that the first code it receives from the EWS is actually 
the rolling code table. When it’s received ECM automatically “burns” it into it’s memory. 

• The alignment procedure is still available in the SERVICE FUNCTIONS menus of EWS 
or ECM. This procedure only “resets” the rolling codes back to #1 in each module. It 
does not change the coding tables. The ignition key must be switched off for 10 sec¬ 
onds after the adjustment is completed. 

• Final note: Once a DME control module Is programmed it can not be used in any 
other vehicle!! 



ST055 M5.2.1 






























































IKE MODIFICATION - CAN BUS ADDITIONS 


The external IKE control module was been incorporat¬ 
ed into the Instrument Cluster for the 1998 model year. 
If IKE replacement is necessary, a complete “Cluster” 
must be ordered and ZCS encoded at time of replace¬ 
ment. 

The CAN bus has also been linked to the Instrument 
Cluster in the 98 model year. The cluster is an impor¬ 
tant link in the system, and vital information is now 
updated faster to the control modules. 

The CAN bus connection to the instrument cluster is 
found at pins 8, 9 and 10 of the blue 26 pin ELO con¬ 
nector on the back. 

The signals transmitted from M5.2.1 ECM over the 
CAN bus to the instrument cluster include: 

• Engine temperature 

• Engine rpm 

• Ti signal (MPG Gauge) 

• “CHECK ENGINE” Light activation 



A malfunction with the interface to the instrument cluster could cause the ASC and trans¬ 
mission fail-safe indicators to appear. In addition, the instruments affected by the signals 
listed above will be inoperative. 



ST055 M5.2.1 














The CAN bus users as of the 98 E38 and E39 vehicles are: 

• ECM (750iL: ECM 1 8,2) 

• AGS 

• ABS/ASC-DSC 

• EML Ills (750iL) 

• Instrument Cluster 

• Steering Angle Sensor (DSC III vehicles only, 9/97 production) 


Note: The CAN Bus network of the 528i does not include the instrument cluster until 3/98 
production.

AUXILIARY FAN CONTROL 


The Auxiliary Fan motor incorporates an out¬ 
put final stage that activates the fan motor at 
variable speeds. 

The auxiliary fan is controlled by M5.2.1 ECM. 

The motor output stage receives power and 
ground and activates the motor based on a 
PWM signal (10 - 100 Hz) received from the 
ECM. 

The fan is activated based on the following 
factors: 

• Radiator outlet temperature sensor input exceeds a preset temperature. 

• IHKA signalling via the K and CAN bus based on calculated refrigerant pressures. 

• Vehicle speed 

• Battery voltage level 

When the over-temperature light in the instrument cluster is on (120°C) the fan is run in the 
overrun function. This signal is provided to the ECM via the CAN bus. When this occurs the 
fan is run at a frequency of 10 Hz.

SECONDARY AIR INJECTION SYSTEM 


The purpose of the secondary air injection system is to provide fresh air to the catalytic con¬ 
verters during the warm-up phase of operation immediately after cold start. This acceler¬ 
ates oxidation of hydrocarbons and brings the catalytic converters to the point of light-off 
earlier. 

The M73 TU secondary air injection system continues to be a two speed system utilizing 
two relays and a slow speed resistor. The introduction of the M5.2.1 ECMs allocated a ded¬ 
icated control circuit for the vacuum vent valve improving comprehensive component mon¬ 
itoring. This continues with the M73 TU M5.2.1 system. 

However, the primary controller of the Secondary Air Injection System has switched for the 
1999 model year (M73 TU - M5.2.1) 

• ECM I activates the vacuum vent valve and Stage I relay simultaneously but separately 
providing the open air ports through the non return valves and slow air pump speed. 

• ECM II activates the resistor bypass circuit through activation of the stage II relay pro¬ 
viding the fast air pump speed if necessary. 

All parameters of operation are programmed in the M 5.2.1 control modules and varied by 
monitored conditions: 


• Engine Temp 

• Engine Speed 

• Engine Load

ELECTRICALLY HEATED THERMOSTAT 


Model specific variants of the electrically heated thermostat are now equipped on all LEV 
compliant engines. The M73 TU thermostat housing has a quick connect coupling. 


This thermostat allows the engine to run hotter than conventional thermostats improving 
fuel economy. The ECM also electrically activates the thermostat to lower the engine 
coolant temperatures based on monitored conditions. It is both a conventionally function¬ 
ing and ECM controlled thermostat (two stage operation). ECM control adds heat to the 
wax core causing the thermostat to open earlier than it’s mechanical temperature rating 
providing increased coolant flow. 


CONVENTIONAL FUNCTION: The 

thermostat begins to open at 103°C. 
This is at the inlet side of the water 
pump and represents the temperature 
of the coolant entering the engine. 
Before the 103°C temperature is real¬ 
ized, the coolant is circulated through 
the engine block by the water pump. 

After the temperature reaches 103°C it 
is maintained as the inlet temperature 
by the thermostat. The coolant tem¬ 
perature at the water pump engine 
outlet is approximately 110°C. The 
additional 7°C is achieved after the 
coolant has circulated through the 
block. 


The operating temperature of the 
engine will remain within this range as 
long as the engine is running at part 
load conditions and the engine 
coolant temperature does not exceed 
113°C.

ECM CONTROL 


Electric thermostat activation is based on the following parameters: 

• Engine temperature > 113°C 

• Radiator Coolant Outlet Temperature 

• Load signal “ti” > 5.8 ms 

• Intake air temp > 52°C 

• Vehicle speed >110 MPH 

When one or more of these monitored conditions is determined, the ECM activates 
(switched ground) the thermostat circuit. The activated heating element causes the wax 
core in the thermostat to heat up and open the thermostat increasing coolant circulation 
through the radiator which brings the engine temperature down. 

The temperature of the coolant at the inlet side of the water pump will drop to approximately 
85°C and the temperature at the outlet side will drop to approximately 103°C when acti¬ 
vated .

INTEGRATED ELECTRIC CATALYTIC CONVERTER ASSEMBLY 


• Integrated catalytic converter assembly including: 

- Hydrocarbon (HC) adsorber in thin-wall ceramics (105.7 mm dia.) 

- Electric catalytic converter heater and metallic backup converter (80 mm dia.) 

- Main catalytic converters in thin-wall ceramics (105.7 mm dia.) 

• Twelve liter volume Central muffler. 

• Two rear mufflers with a volume of 18 liters each. 


The location of the post oxygen sensor is just behind the HC adsorber and complies with 
the ARB catalytic converter monitoring function following the same criteria with the familiar 
post oxygen sensor signal. However, the metallic backup and two main converters are not 
monitored. 


The ARB allows this configuration since the adsorber catalytic converter is the critical ele¬ 
ment in the assembly. The logic being, if the adsorber is detected as being defective the 
entire assembly requires replacement.

ELECTRIC CATALYTIC CONVERTER (E-CAT) ASSEMBLIES 


The name “Adsorber” identifies the first converter of each assembly as a unique critical 
component. The Adsorber has the unique ability to attract and retain residual hydrocarbon 
molecules as it cools. As it warms up it releases the residual HC allowing it to be convert¬ 
ed as it passes through the heating coil, back-up metallic converter and twin main con¬ 
verters. This feature is what makes this catalytic converter so unique providing cleaner cold 
starts and LEV compliance. 

The proportion of HC in the exhaust is very high just after a cold start. This is due to the 
rich fuel/air mixture and incomplete combustion. When initially driving away and during an 
increase in acceleration which follows, the HC proportion sharply increases again. 

The electric catalytic converter's heating coil, which is installed 
directly behind the adsorber, is energized for a maximum of 30 
seconds immediately after the engine has started (engine 
speed > 400 rpm). This ensures that the metallic back-up con¬ 
verter and the main catalytic converters downstream attain 
light-off much earlier. 

The heating coils are provided operating current from an E-CAT control module located 
under the passenger seat. The coils are connected to the E-Cat control module by high 
amperage cables. The cables pass through a rubber grommet on the passenger side floor 
to the E-CAT module location. 


Special Tool Note: The cables must only be removed from the catalytic converters with 
tool 90 88 6 180 050. This tool is designed to prevent damage to the ceramic insulation on

E-CAT CONTROL FUNCTION 


The primary function of the E-CAT control module is to simultaneously control the heating 
of both E-CAT heating coils through high amperage (120A each) power output switches. 
ECM I signals the E-CAT module via the CAN bus requesting activation and deactivation of 
the heating coils. Heating time is for a maximum of 30 seconds but can be shorter in dura¬ 
tion depending on monitored conditions. 


When on, the metallic back-up 
converters which are located just 
behind the heating coils, heat up 
rapidly. As a result, catalytic con¬ 
verter light-off starts almost 
immediately reducing cold start 
emissions in the warm-up phase. 


The E-CAT module receives two 
redundant starter battery tem¬ 
perature signals for monitoring 
the battery temperature. 


The sensors are located in a 
sealed housing connected 
directly to the positive terminal of 
the battery. 


If the starter battery temperature 
falls below 0°C, the E-CAT heat¬ 
ing coils are not switched on.

Once the E-CATs are activated, the control module simultaneously provides the output con¬ 
trol signal to the dual battery isolation switch (signal KATON) requesting the switch which 
opens the circuit between the starter battery and vehicle circuit battery. This ensures the 
E-Cat’s operating power is supplied only from the starter battery (detailed description of two 
battery system further on).

CRITERIA FOR E-CAT HEATING COIL ACTIVATION 


All conditions for switching the E-Cats on are monitored and activated by ECM I. 
Maximum heating time is 30 seconds. The degree of “on” time (calculated amount of nec¬ 
essary E-Cat heating) is dependent on the intake air and coolant temperatures as well as 
the duration of time the engine has been off since the last trip. 

Engine start recognition is determined by the ECM on the basis of various input signals 
(mass air flow, engine speed etc.). All of the following criteria must be met for the coils to 
be switched on: 

• Engine coolant temperature > 0°C and < 90°C 

• Starter battery temperature > 0°C and < 60°C 

• Distance travelled since last engine start > 1 mile. 

• Catalytic converter temperature < 300°C (programmed temperature map) 

• >30 min since engine was previously switched off 

• Vehicle road speed < 3 mph 

• Engine starting time < 5 seconds 

• Time after start recognition > 0.1 seconds 

• Throttle pedal not at WOT 

The E-CAT's are immediately switched off when one or more of the following faults occur 
during an activation period: 

• CAN bus fault — Instrument Cluster 

• CAN bus fault — ECM and E-CAT module 

• Fuel injector fault 

• Misfire detection faults which might damage catalytic converter 

• Fault in output stage of secondary air injection components 

• Fault in engine temperature signal 

• Fault in engine speed sensor 


DIAGNOSIS 

The E-CAT module communicates fault information to ECM I via the CAN bus. The ECM 
relays the diagnostic communication to the DIS/MoDiC. A maximum of 14 E-CAT fault 
codes can be retrieved through ECM I. 

E-CAT specific faults with an illuminated "CHECK ENGINE" Light indicates there have been 
two unsuccessful attempts to heat the catalytic converters.
