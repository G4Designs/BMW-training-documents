LEAK DIAGNOSIS PUMP (LDP SYSTEM) 


Starting with the 98 model year the LDP method of evaporative system leak detection was intro¬ 
duced on E38 and E39 vehicles. 


Components:

Functional Overview: 


• The function of the LDP is to pressurize the 
fuel tank and the evaporative emission sys¬ 
tem to detect leaks. The pump also serves 
as the fresh air inlet path during normal purge 
operation when leak diagnosis is not occur¬ 
ring. 

• The pump contains a spring loaded 
diaphragm which is moved up and down by 
solenoid controlled engine vacuum to gener¬ 
ate the air pressure 



5 

ST055 ME 7.2 






































































































































































































































































































• During a leak test, the normally open vent 
valve is sprung closed to retain the built up 
pressure. 

• The purge valve(s) are also sprung closed to 
seal the system. 

• The reciprocation of the diaphragm pulls in fil¬ 
tered ambient air and pumps it into the fuel 
system via the purge canister as the vacuum 
supply is repetitively opened and closed elec¬ 
trically by the ECM. 



• The ECM monitors the diaphragm movement 
through a reed contact feedback signal and 
compares it to its activation output frequency 
of the vacuum solenoid in the LDP. 

• As the pump continues to operate the 
diaphragm begins to slow down against the 
built up pressure in the system. The time 
delay between the vacuum solenoid activation 
and the reed contact feedback is the basis for 
leak detection. 



- If the reed contact feedback signal slows down considerably this indicates the pressure 
is being held by the system and no leaks are present. 

- If the reed contact feedback signal is slowed down but not to the satisfaction of a sealed 
system the ECM will determine a small leak is present. 

- If there is no delay in the feedback signal the ECM determines a large leak is present (ie: 
missing fuel filler cap).

ON-BOARD REFUELING VAPOR RECOVERY (ORVR) 


The ORVR system recovers and 
stores hydrocarbon fuel vapor that 


was previously released during 
refueling. Non ORVR vehicles vent 


fuel vapors from the tank venting 
line back to the filler neck and in 
many states reclaimed by a vacu¬ 
um receiver (Stage II) on the filling 
station’s fuel pump nozzle. 

When refueling, the pressure of the 
fuel entering the tank forces the 
hydrocarbon vapors through the 
tank vent line to the liquid/ vapor 
separator, through the rollover 
valve and into the charcoal canis-

The HC is stored in the charcoal

air filter. 


ON BOARD DIAGNOSTICS II 


OBD II requires that all vehicle manufacturers comply with extensive fault monitoring capabilities 
for all emission related drivetrain control systems. These systems; ECM, AGS and EML must 
monitor their components electrically and monitor for plausible mechanical engine function. 
Additionally, OBD II provides a separate Diagnostic Link Connector (DLC) located in the vehicle 
interior to access OBD II fault codes with an aftermarket scan tool. BMW center technicians 
utilize BMW diagnostic equipment and software (DIS/MoDiC) to interface with all vehicle 
control systems.

FUEL INJECTORS 


The M62 TU utilizes new fuel injectors man¬ 
ufactured by Bosch. The injector pintle con¬ 
sists of a two ball seat. 

The ball seat design provides a tight seal 
when the injector is closed preventing HC 
formation in the intake. 

The injectors have an ohmic value of 15.5 
ohms. 



NON RETURN FUEL RAIL SYSTEM 

The M62 TU introduces a new method of 
meeting Running Loss Compliance without 
the use of the familiar 3/2 way running loss 
valve. 

The regulated fuel supply is controlled by the 
fuel pressure regulator integrated in the fuel 
filter. A fuel return line is located on the fuel 
filter. 



The system provides even fuel distribution to all fuel injectors due to a balance tube con¬ 
necting the feed with the end of the fuel rail. The new fuel rail does not have a fuel return 
line.

M62 TU EXHAUST SYSTEM 


The M62 TU is equipped with two additional catalytic converters known as “warm-up con¬ 
verters”. This configuration positions the forward mounted warm-up catalytic converters 
closer to the hot exhaust gasses immediately exiting the combustion chambers. The clos¬ 
er location heats the catalytic converters to the point of light-off faster than previous sys¬ 
tems. Earlier light-off reduces cold start emissions by allowing the gas conversion (HC to 
H20, CO to C02 and NOx by reduction to N2 and 02) to occur more rapidly just after cold 
start. 


The system also contains two main catalytic converters. The main exhaust gas conversion 
process occurs further downstream in the main catalytic converters.

The forward mounted warm-up catalytic con¬ 
verters are made of thin-wall ceramics. They 
are mounted in a pliable material called silicatex 
which isolates them from vibrations ensuring a 
long service life. 

For their relatively small size, the catalyst vol¬ 
ume of 878 cm 3 provides a large conversion 
surface area. Use of the thin-wall ceramic 
design also minimizes exhaust back pressure. 

Both pre-catalytic converter oxygen sensors 
are positioned forward of each warm-up cata¬ 
lyst.

PRECIOUS METALSVACUUM COATED 
TOTHIN WALL CERAMIC MONOLITH 
(Surface area = 878 cu cm) 


The Bosch LSH 25 oxygen sensors are carried over from the M62 engine and provide the 
familiar “swinging” voltage signal (0.2 - max lean to 0.8 - max rich) representing oxygen 
content in the exhaust gas. 

The main catalytic converters are also made of thin-wall ceramics. The post catalytic con¬ 
verter oxygen sensors are positioned just behind the main catalytic converters to monitor 
the catalytic converter function. 

The pipes of the exhaust system up to the rear main catalytic converters are made from 
dual wall stainless steel. This design insulates exhaust noise as well as insulating the ther¬ 
mal energy in the hot exhaust gasses to light-off the converters as quickly as possible.

INPUT SIGNALS/COMPONENTS 


CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSORS 

Located on the upper timing case covers, the camshaft position sensors monitor the posi¬ 
tion of the camshafts to establish start of ignition firing order, set up sequential fuel injection 
triggering and for accurate camshaft advance-retard (VANOS) timing feedback. 

Each intake camshaft’s advance-retard angles are adjusted simultaneously yet indepen¬ 
dently. For this reason ME 7.2 requires a camshaft position sensor on each cylinder bank 
for accurate feedback to monitor the VANOS controlled camshaft positioning. 


The sensors are provided with operating power from the ECM relay. The sensors produce 
a unique asymmetrical square-wave signal representative of the impulse wheel shape. The 
sensors are new in the fact that they are “active” hall effect sensors. Active hall sensors 
provide: 

• low signal when a tooth of the camshaft impulse wheel is located in front of the sensor 

• high signal when an air gap is present. 

The active hall sensors supply a signal representative of camshaft position even before the 
engine is running. The ME 7.2 determines an approximate location of the camshafts posi¬ 
tions prior to engine start up optimizing cold start injection (reduced emissions.)

HOT FILM AIR MASS SENSOR (HFM 5) 


The M62 TU is equipped with a new Hot Film 
Air Mass Sensor identified as HFM 5. It is a 
combined air mass/intake air temperature 
sensor. The separate intake air temperature 
sensor is no longer used on the M62 TU. 

The HFM 5 is provided with operating power 
from the ECM relay. Based on calculated 
intake air mass, the HFM 5 generates a vary¬ 
ing voltage between 0.5 and 4.5 volts as an 
input signal to the ME 7.2

An additional improvement of the HFM 5 is that the hot 
film element is not openly suspended in the center bore 
of the sensor as with previous HFMs. It is shrouded by 
a round fronted plastic labyrinth which isolates it from 
intake air charge pulsations. 

This feature allows the HFM to monitor and calculate the 
intake air volume with more accuracy. This feature adds 
further correction for calculating fuel injection “on” time 
(ti) which reduces emissions further.

INTEGRATED AMBIENT BAROMETRIC PRESSURE SENSOR 


The ME 7.2 Control Module contains an integral ambient barometric pressure sensor. The 
sensor is part of the SKE and is not serviceable. The internal sensor is supplied with 5 volts. 
In return it provides a linear voltage of approx. 2.4 to 4.5 volts representative of barometric 
pressure (altitude). 

The ME 7.2 monitors barometric pressure for the following reasons: 

• The barometric pressure signal along with calculated air mass provides an additional 
correction factor to further refine injection “on” time. 


• Provides a base value to calculate the air mass being injected into the exhaust system 
by the secondary air injection system. This correction factor alters the secondary air 
injection “on” time, optimizing the necessary air flow into the exhaust system. 


• To recognize downhill 
driving to postpone 
start of evaporative 
emission leakage diag¬ 
nosis.

RADIATOR OUTLET TEMP SENSOR 


The ME 7.2 uses an additional water temperature 
sensor located on the radiator outlet. 

ME 7.2 requires this signal to monitor the water 
temperature leaving the radiator for precise acti¬ 
vation of the IHKA auxiliary fan. 



DSC III - ROAD SPEED SIGNAL 

ME 7.2 receives the road speed signal directly 
from the DSC III control module for maximum 
vehicle speed management. The DSC control 
module provides a processed output of the right 
rear wheel speed sensor as a digital square wave 
signal. The frequency of the signal is proportion¬ 
al to the speed of the vehicle (48 pulses per one 
revolution of the wheel).

The cruise control function (FGR) of the ME 7.2 also monitors vehicle speed from the redun¬ 
dant vehicle speed CAN bus signal. The CAN bus speed signal is provided by the DSC III 
control module and based on the combined average of both front wheel speed signals. 


Additionally, ME 7.2 monitors all four wheel speed signals via CAN bus signalling to detect 
abrupt fluctuations in vehicle speed signals for the purpose of detecting rough road sur¬ 
faces. This is continuously monitored as part of the OBD II emission requirements provid¬ 
ing a correction factor for misfire detection plausibility. Earlier systems only monitored the 
right rear speed signal input from DSC.

MFL CRUISE CONTROL DATA SIGNAL 


The ME 7.2 control module provides the FGR cruise control function. Throttle activation is 
provided by ME 7.2 automatic control of the EDK and monitoring of the throttle plate posi¬ 
tion feedback potentiometer signals. 

All of the familiar driver requested cruise control function requests are provided to the ME 
7.2 control module via the MFL control module on a single FGR data signal wire. 



BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH 


The Electronic Brake Switch (Hall effect) provides brake pedal position status to the ME 7.2. 
The control module monitors both the brake light and a separate brake light test switch cir¬ 
cuits for plausibility. 

When the brake pedal is pressed the brake light segment of the switch provides a ground 
signal. Simultaneously, the brake light test switch (located in the same housing) provides a 
high signal. 

CLUTCH SWITCH 

The clutch switch is equipped on manual transmission vehicles for deactivating the FGR. It 
is housed in the footwell by the clutch pedal. The hall effect clutch switch interrupts the sin¬ 
gle wire circuit to the ME 7.2 control module when the clutch pedal is pressed.

ST055 ME 7.2 














































































ME 7.2 CAN BUS TOPOLOGY 


The CAN bus consists entirely of a twisted pair wire set. This configuration eliminates the 
need for a ground shield. 

The Engine Control Module has two CAN bus communication ports, one dedicated to AGS 
and the other for the balance of the vehicle’s CAN bus control modules. 

This configuration improves the reliability of CAN bus signalling. If an open occurs in one 
area, the other control systems can still communicate on either side of the open. 

However, signals not reaching their intended recipients will cause CAN bus faults to be 
stored in the affected systems.

OUTPUT CONTROL FUNCTIONS/COMPONENTS 


FUEL PUMP RELAY CONTROL 


ME 7.2 controls the fuel pump relay as with previous systems with regard to engine speed 
input for continual activation of the relay. 


When MRS III was incorporated into production (3-99) the ME 7.2 deactivates the fuel 
pump relay when an airbag is activated as an additional safety function.

E BOX FAN CONTROL 

The E Box fan is controlled by ME 7.2. The control module 
contains an integral NTC temperature sensor for the pur¬ 
pose of monitoring the E box temperature and activating the 
fan. 



When the temperature in the E-Box exceeds predetermined 
values, ME 7.2 provides a switched ground for the E Box fan 
to cool the E box located control modules. 

With every engine start-up, ME 7.2 briefly activates the fan 
ensuring continued fan motor operation for the service life of 
the vehicle. This feature is intended to prevent fan motor 
“lock up” from lack of use due to pitting or corrosion over 
time.

The ME7.2 control unit controls the vacuum

The secondary air pump operates at a start temperature of between 10°C and 40°C. It con¬ 
tinues to operate for a max. of 2 minutes at idle speed. 


ME 7.2 contributes an additional correction factor for secondary air “on” time with the addi¬ 
tional input from the integral ambient barometric pressure sensor. 



ME 7.2 





This sensor provides a base value to calculate the air mass being 
injected into the exhaust system. This helps to “fine tune” the sec¬ 
ondary air injection “on” time, optimizing the necessary air flow 
into the exhaust system which reduces the time to catalytic con¬ 
verter light-off.

AUXILIARY FAN CONTROL 


The Auxiliary Fan motor incorporates an out¬ 
put final stage that activates the fan motor at 
variable speeds. 

The auxiliary fan is controlled by ME 7.2. The 
motor output stage receives power and 
ground and activates the motor based on a 
PWM signal (10 - 100 Hz) received from the 
ME 7.2. 

The fan is activated based on the following 
factors: 



• Radiator outlet temperature sensor input exceeds a preset temperature. 

• IHKA signalling via the K and CAN bus based on calculated refrigerant pressures. 

• Vehicle speed 

• Battery voltage level 


When the over temperature light in the instrument cluster is on (120°C) the fan is run in the 
overrun function. This signal is provided to the DME via the CAN bus. When this occurs 
the fan is run at a frequency of 10 Hz.

INTEGRAL ELECTRIC THROTTLE SYSTEM (EML) 


FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW 

When the accelerator pedal is moved, the PWG provides a change in the monitored sig¬ 
nals. The ME 7.2 compares the input signal to a programmed map and appropriately acti¬ 
vates the EDK motor via proportional pulse width modulated control signals. The control 
module self-checks it’s activation of the EDK motor via the EDK feedback potentiometers. 



Requirements placed on the Electric Throttle System: 


• Regulate the calculated intake air load based on PWG input signals and programmed 
mapping. 

• Control idle air when LL detected with regard to roadspeed as per previous systems. 

• Monitor the driver’s input request for cruise control operation. 

• Automatically position the EDK for accurate cruise control (FGR) operation. 

• Perform all DSC III throttle control interventions. 

• Monitor and carryout max engine and roadspeed cutout. 



ST055 ME 7.2 
















































































ACCELERATOR PEDAL SENSOR (PWG) 


The driver's application of the accelerator pedal is monitored by a PWG sensor in the dri¬ 
ver's footwell. The PWG provides two separate variable voltage signals to the ME 7.2 con¬ 
trol module for determining the request for operating the Electric Throttle Valve (EDK) as well 
as providing a kickdown request with automatic transmission vehicles.

• Standard transmission vehicles (E39 540i) have slightly lower voltage signals at max 
throttle position due to the throttle pedal stop (ie Pot 1 = 3.8volts). However, ME 7.2 
programming recognizes the lower values of a standard transmission vehicle as the max 
throttle position. 


• In vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission (A5S 440Z), the ME 7.2 recognizes 
the max pedal value (4.5V) as a kickdown request and signals the AGS via CAN bus. 


PWG SIGNAL MONITORING & PWG FAILSAFE OPERATION: 

• If the monitored PWG potentiometer signals are not plausible, ME 7.2 will only use the 
lower of the two signals as the driver’s pedal request input providing failsafe operation. 
Throttle response will be slower and maximum throttle position will be reduced. 

• When in PWG failsafe operation, ME 7.2 sets the EDK throttle plate and injection time 
to idle (LL) whenever the brake pedal is depressed. 

• When the system is in PWG failsafe operation, the instrument cluster matrix display will 
post “Engine Emergency Program” and PWG specific fault(s) will be stored in memory.

ELECTRIC THROTTLE VALVE (EDK) CONTROL 


The throttle valve assembly of the M62 TU is an electric throttle valve (EDK) controlled 
by an integral EML function of the ME 7.2. {o, - 


• The throttle plate is positioned by a gear reduction DC 
motor drive. 

• The motor is controlled by proportionately switched 
high/low PWM signals at a basic frequency of 2000 
Hz. 



• Engine idle speed control is a function of the EDK. 
Therefore, the M62 TU does not require a separate 
idle control valve. 


EDK ADAPTATION 
PROCEDURE: 

When a replacement EDK 
is installed the adaptation 
values of the previous EDK 
must be cleared from the 
ME 7.2 control module.

EDK THROTTLE POSITION FEEDBACK SIGNALS 


The EDK throttle plate position is monitored by two integrated potentiometers. The poten¬ 
tiometers provide DC voltage feedback signals as input to the ME 7.2 for throttle and idle 
control functions. 


Potentiometer signal 1 is the primary signal, Potentiometer signal 2 is used as a plausibility 
cross-check through the total range of throttle plate movement. 


MOTOR 

CONTROL 




EDK FEEDBACK SIGNAL MONITORING & FAILSAFE OPERATION: 

• If plausibility errors are detected between Pot 1 and Pot 2, ME 7.2 will calculate the 
inducted engine air mass (from HFM signal) and only utilize the potentiometer signal that 
closely matches the detected intake air mass. 

- The ME 7.2 uses the air mass signalling as a “virtual potentiometer” (pot 3) for a 
comparative source to provide failsafe operation. 

- If ME 7.2 cannot calculate a plausible conclusion from the monitored pots (1 or 2 
and virtual 3) the EDK motor is switched off and fuel injection cut out is activated 
(no failsafe operation possible). 

• The EDK is continuously monitored during all phases of engine operation. It is also 
briefly activated when KL15 is initially switched on as a “pre-flight check” to verify it’s 
mechanical integrity (no binding, appropriate return spring tension) by monitoring the 
motor control amperage and the reaction speed of the EDK feedback potentiometers. 

If faults are detected the EDK motor is switched off and fuel injection cut off is activat¬ 
ed (no failsafe operation possible). The engine does however continue to run extreme¬ 
ly rough at idle speed.

M62 TU VANOS 


OVERVIEW 


The M62 TU VANOS system provides stepless VANOS functionality on each intake 
camshaft. The system is continuously variable within its range of adjustment providing opti¬ 
mized camshaft positioning for all engine operating conditions. 


While the engine is running, both 
intake camshafts are continuously 
adjusted to their optimum posi¬ 
tions. This enhances engine per¬ 
formance and reduces tailpipe 
emissions. 

Both camshafts are adjusted 
simultaneously within 20° (maxi¬ 
mum) of the camshafts rotational 
axis. 

This equates to a maximum span 
of 40° crankshaft rotation. The 
camshaft spread angles for both 
banks are as follows.

VANOS CONTROL SOLENOID & CHECK VALVE: The VANOS solenoid is a two wire, 
pulse width modulated, oil flow control valve. The valve has four ports; 

1. Input Supply Port - Engine Oil Supply 

2. Input/Output Retard Port - Rear of piston/helical gear (retarded camshaft position) 

3. Input/Output Advance Port - Front of piston/helical gear (advanced camshaft position) 

4. Output Vent - Released oil 

A check valve is positioned forward of the solenoid in the cylinder head oil gallery. The 
check valve retains oil in the VANOS transmission and oil circuits after the engine is turned 
off. This prevents the possibility of piston movement (noise) within the VANOS transmission 
system on the next engine start. 


25 

ST055 ME 7.2 

















































VANOS TRANSMISSION: The primary and secondary timing chain sprockets are inte¬ 
grated with the VANOS transmission. The transmission is a self-contained unit. 


The controlled adjustment of the 
camshaft occurs inside the “transmis¬ 
sion”. Similar in principle to the six 
cylinder engine VANOS systems, con¬ 
trolled oil flow moves the piston. 

The helical gear cut of the piston acts 
on the helical gears on the inside sur¬ 
face of the transmission and rotates 
the camshaft to the specific advanced 
or retarded angle position. 

Three electrical pin contacts are locat¬ 
ed on the front surface to verify the 
default maximum retard position using 
an ohmmeter. This is required during 
assembly and adjustment.

CAMSHAFT POSITION IMPULSE WHEELS: The camshaft position impulse wheels pro¬ 
vide camshaft position status to the engine control module via the camshaft position sen¬ 
sors. The asymmetrical placement of the sensor wheel pulse plates provides the engine 
control module with cylinder specific position ID in conjunction with crankshaft position. 



ST055 ME 7.2 




























































































































































































M62 TU VANOS CONTROL 


As the engine camshafts are rotated by the primary and secondary timing chains, the 
ME7.2 control module activates the VANOS solenoids via a PWM (pulse width modulated) 
ground signal based on a program map. The program is influenced by engine speed, load, 
and engine temperature. 

• Shown below: In the inactive or default position, the valves direct 100% engine oil flow 
to achieve max “retard” VANOS positioning. 



• Top of next page: As the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) increases on the control sig¬ 
nal, the frequency of on time increases and opens the advanced oil port more often. Oil 
flow pushes the piston toward the advance position. Simultaneously the oil flow on the 
retard side (rear) of the piston is proportionally decreased and directed to the vent port 
in the solenoid valve and drains into the cylinder head. 

• Bottom of next page: At maximum PWM control, 100% oil flow is directed to the front 
surface of the piston pushing it rearward to maximum advance. 

Varying the pulse width (on time) of the solenoids control signals proportionately regulates 
the oil flow on each side of the pistons to achieve the desired VANOS advance angle.

M62 TU CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSORS 


Located on the upper timing case covers, the camshaft position sensors monitor the posi¬ 
tion of the camshafts to establish start of ignition firing order, set up sequential fuel injection 
triggering and for accurate camshaft advance-retard (VANOS) timing feedback. 


Each intake camshaft’s advance-retard angles are adjusted simultaneously yet indepen¬ 
dently. For this reason ME 7.2 requires a camshaft position sensor on each cylinder bank 
for accurate feedback to monitor the VANOS controlled camshaft positioning. 


The sensors are provided with operating power from the ECM relay. The sensors produce 
a unique asymmetrical square-wave signal representative of the impulse wheel shape. The 
sensors are new in the fact that they are “active” Hall effect sensors. Active Hall sensors 
provide: 

• low signal when a tooth of the camshaft impulse wheel is located in front of the sensor 

• high signal when an air gap is present. 

The active hall sensors supply a signal representative of camshaft position even before the 
engine is running. The ME 7.2 determines an approximate location of the camshafts posi¬ 
tions prior to engine start up optimizing cold start injection (reduced emissions.)

VANOS SERVICE NOTES 


VALVE TIMING PROCEDURES 

Refer to TIS for complete Valve Timing Procedures. M62 TU valve timing adjustment 
requires setting the VANOS transmissions to the max. retard positions with an ohmmeter 
and attaching the camshaft gears to each camshaft with single reverse threaded bolts. 

• After locking the crankshaft at TDC, the camshaft alignment tools (P/N 90 88 6 112 440) 
are placed on the square blocks on the rear of the camshafts locking them in place. 

• The exhaust camshaft sprockets and VANOS transmission units with timing chains are 
placed onto their respective camshafts. 

• The exhaust camshaft sprockets and VANOS transmissions are secured to the 
camshafts with their respective single, reverse threaded bolt. Finger tighten only at this 
point. Install the chain tensioner into the timing chain case and tension the chain. 

• Connect an ohmmeter across two of the three pin contacts on the front edge of one of 
the VANOS transmissions. Twist the inner hub of transmission to the left (counter clock¬ 
wise). Make sure the ohmmeter indicates closed circuit. This verifies that the transmis¬ 
sion in the default max retard position. 

• Using an open end wrench on the camshaft to hold it in place, torque the VANOS trans¬ 
mission center bolt to specification. 

CAMSHAFT IMPULSE WHEEL POSITION TOOLS 

The camshaft impulse wheels require a special tool set 
to position them correctly prior to torquing the retaining 
nuts. 

The impulse wheels are identical for each cylinder 
bank. The alignment hole in each wheel must align 
with the tool’s alignment pin. Therefore the tools are 
different and must be used specifically for their bank. 

The tool rests on the upper edge of the cylinder head 
and is held in place by the timing case bolts. 

Refer to the TIS repair manual section for complete 
information.

ST055 ME 7.2 








VANOS SOLENOID REPLACEMENT 


Refer to TIS repair manual section for com¬ 
plete solenoid replacement procedures. 

The solenoids are threaded into the oil distri¬ 
bution flanges through a small opening in the 
upper timing case covers. 

Special Tool 11 6 420 is required. 



fll 6420 ‘j 


VANOS TRANSMISSION RETARD POSI¬ 
TION SET UP TOOLS 

Special Tool 11 6 440 is used to rotate the 
transmission to the full retard position when 
checking the piston position with an ohmme- 
ter. 

This tool engages the inner hub of the trans¬ 
mission provides an easy method of twisting 
it to the left for the ohmmeter test. 

Refer to SI Bulletin 04 12 98 for additional 
special tool information. 


DIAGNOSIS 



The VANOS is fully compatible with the diagnostic software providing specific fault codes 
and test modules. Additionally, diagnostic requests section provides status of the PWM of 
the VANOS solenoids and camshaft position feedback via the camshaft position sensors. 
The Service Functions section of the DIS/MoDiC also provides a VANOS system test.
