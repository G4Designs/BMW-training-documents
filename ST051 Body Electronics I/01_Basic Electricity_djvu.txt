Basic Electricity 

Electricity is defined as the movement of electrons from one atom to another. In order to 
understand electricity a basic explanation of the atom is needed. 

All matter is made up of molecules. An atom is the smallest particle to which a molecule 
can be reduced. 

Atoms consist of: 

Electrons - Negatively charged particles orbiting around a nucleus. 

Protons - Positively charged particles in the nucleus. 

Neutrons - Uncharged particles in the nucleus that stabilize the protons.

An atom is balanced or displays a neutral charge when the number of protons and elec¬ 
trons are equal. 

Through various means (e.g. A chemical reaction in the automotive battery) electrons 
are displaced from their normal orbit. 

These displaced electrons attach themselves to other atoms, creating an unbalance in 
the number of electrons and protons in both atoms. 

Atoms which loose or repel an electron become positively charged because of the 
greater number of protons. These atoms are called “Positive Ions”. 

Atoms which pickup or gain extra electrons become negatively charged and are called 
“Negative Ions”. 

The negative ions will attempt to repel the extra electron and the positive ions will 
attempt to attract it.

Basic Electricity 















The movement of free electrons from one 
atom to another is called electron flow or elec¬ 
tric current flow. 

This flow of electrons does not mean that a 
single electron travels the entire length of the 
wire. 

Electron flow is the movement of free elec¬ 
trons from atom to atom and the transmission 
of an electrical impulse from one end of a 
conductor to the other. 

The constant unbalancing and rebalancing of 
the atoms takes place in less than one mil¬ 
lionth of a second.

tains billions of atoms

Conductors, Insulators and Semi-Conductors 

Electrical properties of various materials are determined by the number of electrons 
the outer ring of their atoms. 

Conductors 

Materials with 1 -3 electrons in the atoms 
outer ring make it easy for electrons to move 
from atom to atom. Remember that the def¬ 
inition of current flow is the movement of 
free electrons from one atom to another. 

The electrons in the outer ring of these con¬ 
ductors are loosely held and even a low 
EMF will cause the flow of free electrons. 

Many metals are good conductors, especial¬ 
ly gold, silver, copper, and aluminum. But 
not all conductors have the same amount of 

resistance to the flow of free electrons. Conductor 



Insulators 

Materials with 5-8 electrons in their outer ring 
have those electrons bound tightly. These 
materials are insulators (Poor conductors). 

The electrons in the outer rings resist move¬ 
ment, the atoms don’t give up the electrons 
easily or accept free electrons easily. 

This effectively stops the flow of free elec¬ 
trons and thus any electrical current. 

Materials such as rubber, glass, and certain 
plastics are examples of good insulators. 

Semi-Conductors 

Materials with exactly 4 electrons in the 
atoms outer ring are neither conductors nor 
insulators. 

The 4 electrons in the outer ring cause spe¬ 
cial electrical properties which give them the 
name “Semi-Conductor”. 

Materials such as Germanium and Silicone 
are two widely used semi-conductors.

Electromotive Force 

Friction, light, heat, pressure, chemical reaction or magnetic action are all ways that elec¬ 
trons are freed. The free electrons will move away from the “Electron Moving Force” 
(EMF). A stream of free electrons form an electrical current.

The battery and the generator are the primary and secondary means by which free elec¬ 
trons are generated in automobiles. 


The chemical reaction taking place in the 
battery creates an Electromotive Force (EMF) 
that provides us with the positive ions and 
negative ions. 

The generator through magnetic induction is 
our other source of free electrons. (Positive 
and negative ions) 

The positive ions collect at the positive bat¬ 
tery terminal and the negative ions collect at 
the negative battery terminal. 


Positive 

Ions 


Negative 

Ions 



The positive and negative ions provide no 
energy unless a path between them is estab¬ 
lished. This path is normally in the form of a 
load (e.g. bulb, electric motor or other electri¬ 
cal consumer) placed across the positive and 
negative terminals of the battery either directly 
or through wires. 



7 

Basic Electricity 




















































Theory of Electron Flow 


Free electrons are pushed out of the battery 
negative terminal through a conductor to the 
positive terminal. When a path is established 
electrons have a route from the negative tern 
nal to the positive terminal of the battery. 

That route may take the electrons through 
wires, motors, light bulbs or other electrical 
consumers. 

The mission of the electrons is always to 
return to the source of their energy which is 
the battery.

Theory of Electron Flow 


The Theory of Electron Flow represents the 
actual path of the electrons in an electrical 
circuit, from negative to positive. 


Conventional Theory of Electron Flow 


Before Science gave a glimpse of the electron, 
it was generally believed that electricity (elec¬ 
trons) flowed from the positive charge to the 
negative charge. 

Most electrical symbols, wiring diagrams, and 
teaching is based on the “Conventional Theory 
of Electron Flow” which states that electrons 
flow from positive to negative. 

From this point on all references to current flow 
will be defined by the Conventional Theory of 
Electron Flow. 



Conventional Theory of Electron Flow 

Conventional Theory of Electron Flow, is some¬ 
times referred to as the Automotive Theory of 
Electron Flow.

Basic Electricity 

























































Voltage 

The potential of the electrons to flow is measured in Volts. 

Think of voltage as pressure, the driving force (pressure) pushing the electrons from posi¬ 
tive to negative. 



“One volt is the potential difference required to push one Amp of current through one 
Ohm of resistance.” 

Voltage is present between two points when a positive charge exists at one point and a 
negative charge at the other point. 

The amount of voltage available is dependent on the number of ions at each terminal of 
the battery. 



Less Voltage More Voltage 


Note: Maintaining proper voltage is important. As voltage drops, so does the 
capacity for current flow. 


9 

Basic Electricity 


















Generating Voltage 


Generator 

In a generator, the conductor moves through 
a stationary magnetic field inducing voltage 
at the commutator, which connects to the 
circuit through brushes. 

The voltage induced is direct current. 



Commutator 


Alternator 

In an alternator the magnetic field moves 
(rotates) through the stationary conductor 
producing voltage in the circuit. 

The voltage induced is alternating current. 



Ignition Coil 

Voltage can be induced by the building or 
collapsing of a magnetic field across a 
stationary conductor. 

B+ power is supplied by the battery and a 
magnetic field is set up around the coiled 
conductor. The DME grounds or pulls low 
the current from the conductor and the loss 
of current causes the magnetic field to 
collapse inducing voltage in the secondary 
conductor.

■ DC Voltage 

A flow of current that moves continuously in one direction from a point of high potential to 
a point of low potential is referred to as DC (Direct Current). 

Most automotive circuits operate on DC voltage as supplied by the battery(s).

■ AC Voltage 

Current which reverses its direction at regular intervals is called AC (Alternating Current). 

This regular and continuous reversal of current flow (cycle) occurs many times per second. 

AC voltage as produced by an automotive alternator must be changed to direct current so 
that the battery can be charged.

Ampere 

The unit of measure for current flow is the 
“Ampere”, commonly referred to as “Amps”. 


Amps is the counting of electrons flowing on 
a conductor past a given point. One amp of 
current flow is equal to 6.23 billion billion 
(6.23 x 10 18 ) electrons moving past a point in 
one second. 

Amps allow you to measure the volume of 
electrical energy “amperes” flowing through 
a wire or electrical consumer.

ooooooo 

OOOOOOOl 



Ohms 

The “Resistance” of a circuit opposes 
current flow. The unit of measure for 
resistance is the “Ohm”. 

One ohm is defined as the amount of resis¬ 
tance that will allow one amp to flow when 
being pushed by one volt of pressure. 

Resistance slows the flow of current (reduces 
the number of electrons flowing). 

Resistance changes electrical energy into 
another form of energy (e.g. heat, light or 
motion). 



Resistance reduces the number 
of electrons flowing 


Watt 

Measure of electrical power. 

Generally speaking, power is the ability to per¬ 
form work within a defined period of time. 

The basic unit of electrical power is the Watt 
(W) or Volt-ampere (VA). The latter is derived 
from the calculation with voltage and current.

Circuits 

Electricity must have a complete or closed loop circuit to flow. A “Circuit” is defined as 
an unbroken, uninterrupted path which begins and ends at the same point. In the auto¬ 
mobile that point is the battery. The electron flow must be from the battery through the 
wiring and consumers back to the battery. That flow represents a complete circuit. 

A typical circuit will contain: 

1. A battery and/or generator system (EMF or source of the electrons) 

2. Conductors (wiring to deliver the electrons to the consumers) 

3. Consumers (the load being placed on the system) 

Any break or interruption in this circuit will cause the circuit to cease operation.

There are three basic types of circuits:

• Parallel 

• Series/Parallel

Basic Electricity 























































Switch 


Series Circuit 

A Series circuit provides one path for the current 
flow. That path is from the source of the current 
(the battery) through a conductor, consumer and 
back to the source. 

A Series circuit provides constant current flow 
(amps) through the entire circuit. Amps measured 
in any two places in the circuit will be equal. 





Parallel Circuit 


A Parallel circuit provides multiple current paths. 
In a Parallel circuit, all of the component’s posi¬ 
tive terminals are connected to one point and 
all of the component’s negative terminals are 
connected to a different common point. 

Source voltage is the same at all loads. 

The current flow in a parallel circuit will be equal 
to the sum of the current flowing through each 
branch of the circuit. 


Switch 




Series-Parallel Circuit 

A Series-Parallel circuit contains portions of the 
current path that are in series with each other 
and other portions of the path that are parallel 
with each other. A headlight circuit would typi¬ 
cally be this type of Series/Parallel circuit. The 
headlight switch is in series with the headlights, 
and the headlights are in parallel branches with 
each other.

Ohm’s Law 

The key to intelligent troubleshooting of electrical circuits is a thorough understanding 
of Ohm’s Law. Ohm’s Law states that the current flowing in a circuit varies directly with 
the voltage and inversely with the resistance. 

The pressure of one volt applied to one Ohm of resistance will cause one amp of 
current to flow. If the voltage increases, current will increase. If resistance increases, 
current will decrease. 

Knowing any two of the three factors (volts, resistance or current) enables the third 
factor to be calculated using Ohm’s Law. 

The mathematical expression is: Volts = Resistance X Current 
This formula is expressed in the Ohm’s Law Triangle. 

To find a missing factor, insert the known factors in the appropriate position and perform 
the math. A horizontal line between two factors means to divide, a vertical line means 
multiply. 



V (also U or E) = Volts 
I (also A) = Current in Amps 
R = Resistance in Q 

Note: “I” refers to current 
intensity. 


Ohm’s Law Triangle 

Understanding of Ohm’s Law is essential in the diagnosis of electrical problems. A 
practical understanding of how the three factors affect each other is equally useful. 

• Source voltage is not affected by current or resistance. It can only have three states. 

Too low - Current flow will be low. 

Too high - Current flow will also be too high. 

Correct voltage - Current flow will be dependent on the resistance. 

• Current Flow will be directly affected by either voltage or resistance. 

High voltage or low resistance will cause an increase in current flow. 

Low voltage or high resistance will cause a decrease in current flow. 

• Resistance is not affected by either voltage or current. Resistance like source voltage 
can have only three states. 

Too low - current will be too high if the voltage is ok. 

Too high - current flow will be low if the voltage is ok. 

Correct resistance - current flow will be high or low, dependent on voltage.

Basic Electricity 




Ohm’s Law - Series Circuits 

Applying Ohm’s Law in a series circuit requires simple math. The current has only one 
path. Circuit resistance total is arrived at by adding the individual resistances. Amperage 
is calculated by dividing source voltage by the total resistance. 



Key Features - Series Circuit: 

• Current through each load is the same. 

• Total resistance equals the sum of the 
individual resistances. 

• Voltage drop across each load will be 
different if the resistance is different. 

• Total voltage drop equals source voltage. 


17 

Basic Electricity 






Example: 

Series Circuit 




A 


Rl + R2 = Rt 

V / R t = A 


If: R-j = 20. 

R 2 = 4Q 
V =12.0 volts 
A = ? 

To calculate total resistance. 

Rf = R-j + R 2 
R t = 2 + 4 
R t = 6Q 

Now that the total resistance is known, we can calculate for the amperage. 

A = V/R t 
A= 12/6 
A= 2 Amps (I) 

The total amperage can be used to calculate the expected voltage drop at each bulb? 
Ax R-j = voltage across bulb 1 A x R 2 = voltage across bulb 2 
2x2 = 4 volts 2x4=8 volts 

If the two voltage drops are added, the result should be source voltage. 

Voltage drop across bulb 1 + voltage drop across bulb 2 = source voltage 
4 v + 8v= 12v

Basic Electricity 


































Ohm’s Law Parallel Circuit - 2 Branches 

A Working in a Parallel circuit requires a little more math. Each branch of the circuit has 
it’s own path to the voltage source. Before amps are calculated total circuit resistance 
must be found. 


Key Features - Parallel Circuit: 

• Current flow through each branch can be different 
if the resistances are different. 

• Total Resistance of the circuit is less than the resis¬ 
tance of the lowest branch. 

• Voltage drop across each branch circuit is the 
same. 

• Total current is the sum of the branches. 


Parallel Circuit 



19 

Basic Electricity 




































Example 1: 

If: Ri=3Q 

R 2 = 6Q 

Voltage =12.0 volts 

The current for both branch and R 2 can be calculated using Ohm’s Law. 

V/R'j = branch current V / R 2 - branch current 

12/3 = 4amps 12/6 = 2amps 

We can add the current flowing through each branch to determine the total amperage. 
Amperage of branch 1 + Amperage of branch 2 - Total circuit current 
4 a + 2 a = 6 amps 

We can also calculate for the total resistance of the circuit. 

Rf = (R^ x R 2 ) / (R'j + R 2 ) 

R t = (3 x 6)1(3 + 6) 

R t = 2Q 

Example 2: 

If: R 1 =6Q 

R 2 = 6Q 

To calculate the total resistance in an parallel circuit with resistances that are the same we 
could use the formula: 

Rf ~ R(either ) ! ^ 

R t = 6/2 
R t = 3Q

Basic Electricity 



Ohm’s Law Parallel Circuit - More than 2 Branches 

Calculating circuit resistance in a Parallel circuit with more than 2 branches is performed 
by one of two methods. All the key features for a Parallel circuit still apply. 



Parallel Circuit 

Example: 1 


If: Rj =3Q 

R 2 = 3Q 


Key Features Parallel Circuit 

• Voltage drop across each branch circuit is 
the same. 

• Current flow through each branch can be 
different if the resistance is different. 

• Total resistance of the circuit is less than 
the lowest resistance. 

• Total circuit current is the sum of the 
branches. 


R 3 = 6 Q 
R/j — 4Q

Example: 2 

If: R-j =3Q 

R 2 = 3Q 
R 3 = 6Q 
R 4 — 4Q 



To calculate the total resistance we can use the formula R br = ( R 1 xR 2 )/(R-j + R 2 ) 
to calculate the resistance of two branches at a time. 

R br1 = ( R 1 x R 2) f ( R 1 + R 2) 

R bri=(3 x 3)/(3 + 3) 

R br1 — 9/6 
R br1 ~ 1-5Q 

R br2 = ( R br1 xR 3) / ( R brl + R 3> 

R br2 = ( 1 - 5 x 6)/(1.5 + 6) 

R br2 = 9 / 7.5 
R j Dr 2 = 1-2C2 

R t = ( R br2 x R 4) 1 ( R br2 + R 4) 

R t = ( 1.2 x 4) 1(1.2 + 4) 

R t = 4.815.2 
R t -. 92Q 

Either formula you choose to utilize to calculate total resistance in a parallel circuit that 
has two or more branched will render the correct answer. 

Please note that the following rules are still applicable all for this parallel circuits: 

• Current flow through each branch can be different if the resistances are different. 

• Total Resistance of the circuit is less than the resistance of the lowest branch. 

• Voltage drop across each branch circuit is the same. 

• Total current is the sum of the branches. 


22 

Basic Electricity 


































Ohm’s Law in Series-Parallel Circuit 

When calculating resistance in a series-parallel circuit, always calculate the equivalent 
resistance in the parallel portion of the circuit. Then add this resistance (equivalent resis¬ 
tance) to the resistance of the series portion of the circuit. 


Key Features - Series-Parallel Circuit: 

• Current in the series portion of the circuit is the same 
at any point of that portion. 

• Total circuit resistance is the sum of the parallel 
branch equivalent resistance and the series portion 
resistance. 

• Voltage applied to the parallel branch is source volt¬ 
age minus any voltage drop across loads wired in 
series to the parallel branch in front of it in the circuit. 

• The series portion of the circuit directly affects the 
parallel branches of that circuit.

Example: 1 

If: R 1 =4Q 

R 2 = 6Q 
R 3 = 2Q 


Calculate the equivalent resistance value of R1 and R2. 

Remember the resistance of a parallel circuit is lower than the lowest resistance in that 
circuit. The resistance of this portion of the circuit must be lower than 4Q, the lowest 
resistance. 

Rparallel branch ~ 7 x ^2^ ^ (^1 + ^2^

Now follow the rules of a Series circuit. 

The total circuit resistance is equal to the sum of the individual resistances.

Rf= 2.4Q + 2Q 
Rf= 4.4Q 


Alternate Formula for equivalent resistance: 

Find the current draw of each parallel branch, add together to get the total cur¬ 
rent draw of the parallel portion, then using ohms law find the resistance of the 
parallel branch.

Electrical Power 

From a technical point of view, the colloquial expression "current consumption" is not cor¬ 
rect as the current that flows into a device also flows out of it again. As a matter of fact the 
electrons in standard household current only move a short distance back and forth in the 
conductor without an appreciable number of electrons flowing out of the line into the 
device. What actually "flows" is electrical energy. This energy is also not consumed but 
rather it is converted, e.g. into mechanical energy (motor), thermal energy (hair dryer) and 
chemical energy (charging batteries for mobile phones). The work performed (the prod¬ 
uct of voltage, current and time) is determined with an electricity meter. For this reason, 
the "current consumption" is counted in kilowatt hours and not in the unit of current 
ampere. 

Generally speaking, power is the ability to perform work within a defined period of time. 

Electrical power is a value that can be found in the most diverse variety of definitions in 
electronics and electrical engineering. The common factors of all power (for direct volt¬ 
age) are the unit of measure and the formula symbol. 

Formula Symbol 

The formula symbol for power is upper case R 


Unit of Measure 

The basic unit of electrical power is the Watt (W) or Volt-ampere (VA). The latter is derived 
from the calculation with voltage and current. The unit of measure VA can be found often 
on transformers and electric motors. 


The mathematical relationship between electrical power F) electrical voltage U, electrical 
current and electrical resistance is represented in the following diagram. 



P = U*I 
P = V * A 

U = Voltage 
I = Amperage 
P = Power 
R = Resistance

The usefulness of electricity is greatly expanded through magnetism. Magnetism 
enables the existence of electric motors, generators, coils, relays, solenoids, transform¬ 
ers, etc. Magnetism, like electricity, can’t be seen, weighed on a scale or measured with 
a ruler. How it works and is put it to use can be understood. 

Two theories exist to explain how magnets work. The first theory states that a large quan¬ 
tity of small magnetized particles exist in a magnet. If the item is not magnetized the par¬ 
ticles are arranged in a random order. When the item becomes magnetized the particles 
align with each other. 

The second theory states that when the electrons of atoms are arranged in a certain 
order, the circles of force of each atom combine creating the magnetism.

Fundamentals of Magnetism 

• A magnet sets up a field of force. 

• Magnetic lines of force form closed loops that flow from North to South. 

• The space through which magnetic lines of force flow is called the magnetic field. 

• The magnetic field is strongest closer to the magnet and becomes weaker as it 
gets further away. 

• Magnetic lines of force never cross each other. 

• There is no known insulator against magnetism. 

• Magnetic lines pass more easily through iron and steel than air. 

• Opposing forces will occur at opposite ends of the magnet (Polarity). 

One end is the North Pole (+), the opposite end is the South Pole (-). 

• Like poles repel each other, unlike poles attract each other. 

• Some materials (wood, ceramics, and some metals) cannot be magnetized. 




27 

Basic Electricity 





There are two common types of magnets: 

• Permanent Magnets - made from materials such as hardened steel that become 
magnetic when subjected to an outside magnetizing force and remain magnetic 
even after the outside force has been removed. 

• Temporary Magnets - made from materials such as soft iron that remain magnetic 
only as long as an outside magnetic force is present. 


The lines of force of all magnets, either per¬ 
manent or temporary flow from the North 
Pole of the magnet to the South Pole. The 
magnetic lines of force or “flux” are stronger 
closer to the magnet and get weaker as the 
distance from the magnet increases. (Fig. 
19/1) 



Fig.19/1 


Polarity refers to the opposing forces occur¬ 
ring at opposite ends of the magnet. All 
magnets have a North Pole and a South 
Pole. Like poles will repel each other and 
unlike poles will attract. (Fig.19/2) 


Most temporary magnetic fields are pro¬ 
duced by electricity flow. Whenever current 
flows through a conductor magnetic lines of 
force develop around the conductor. 

These lines of force form a circular pattern. 
The lines can be visualized as a magnetic 
cylinder extending the entire length of the 
conductor. (Fig. 19/3) 




Fig.19/2 



Fig.19/3 


The lines of force have direction and change dependent on direction of current flow. 

The density of the lines of force are dependent on current flow through the conductor. 
The greater the current flow, the stronger the magnetic field that will be around the con¬ 
ductor. 


28 

Basic Electricity 












































Passing a current flow through a conductor will not generate a magnetic field strong 
enough to perform any work. 

If the conductor is coiled, the lines of force combine and become more dense forming a 
stronger field (Fig.20/1). 

The greater the number of turns of the conductor or the stronger the current flowing 
through the conductor the stronger the magnetic field. 



Fig.20/1 


Inserting an iron core in the coiled conductor increases the magnetic field even more as 
iron makes a better path for the magnetic lines than air (Fig.20/2). 

This conductor wound around an iron bar is an “Electromagnet”. A coil with an air core is 
a “Solenoid”. 



Fig.20/2 

Electromagnetic Induction 

Producing a magnetic field by flowing current through a conductor is a process that can 
be reversed. A magnetic field can be set up that will cause current to flow in a conductor. 
This is called inducing or generating electricity by magnetism. 

To induce voltage in a conductor it is necessary to have relative motion between the con¬ 
ductor and the magnetic field. This motion can be in any one of three forms: 

• The conductor moves or rotates in a stationary magnetic field as in a DC Generator. 

• The magnetic field rotates in a stationary conductor producing voltage in the circuit 
as in an AC Generator or Alternator. 


The building or collapsing of a magnetic field across a stationary conductor, as in an 
Ignition Coil.

Electrical Components 
Coil 

A basic coil is represented by a length of wire wound about a solid body. This body, 
however, is not absolutely necessary. Its main purpose is to stabilize the thin wire. 

By winding a current conductor to form a coil, the lines of magnetic field will be bundled 
on the inside of the coil where they run parallel and with the same density. This is known 
as a homogeneous magnetic field. A north pole is created at the outlet of the field lines 
and a south pole at the inlet. 

The most important physical property of a coil is its inductance. 

The inductance of a coil is the ability to convert electrical energy into magnetic energy in 
its own windings. 

In addition to inductance, however, standard coils exhibit other (mostly undesirable) prop¬ 
erties such as electrical resistance or capacitance. 

The strength of the magnetic field of a coil depends on: 

• The number of windings N, 

• current intensity I and 

• the Structure of the coil Coil in a direct current circuit 

The magnetic field can be boosted by a 
factor of 1000 by placing an iron core in the 
coil. The iron core is not part of the current 
circuit. Such a coil with an iron core is 
known as an "electromagnet". The soft 
magnetic iron core remains magnetic only 
for as long as current I flows through the 
coil. 

A switch S connects a coil L via resistor R 
to a direct voltage source. 

Almost the entire voltage UB is applied at 
the coil at the moment the switch is 
switched on. 

At this moment, the coil acts as an inter¬ 
ruption, i.e. it therefore behaves in the 
reverse way compared to a capacitor. With 
time, the current flowing through the coil 
increases and the voltage applied at the coil 
decreases.

The magnetic field produced in the coil collapses when the voltage UB is switched off 
thus inducing a voltage. This voltage UL enables a current to flow through resistor R until 
the magnetic field is completely converted to electrical energy and is converted to heat in 
resistor R.

Solenoids 


A Solenoid, like a relay, uses current flow and 
electromagnetism to produce mechanical 
movement. Solenoids consist of a coil winding 
around a spring loaded metallic plunger. 

When current flows through the winding, the 
magnetic field attracts the movable plunger, 
pulling it against spring pressure into the center 
of the coil. When current flow stops, the mag¬ 
netic field collapses and the plunger is moved 
out of the coil by spring pressure. 

Solenoids are commonly used in starter motors, 
injectors and purge valves.

Switches 


A Switch is a mechanical device used to start, stop or redirect current flow. A switch can 
be installed on the positive side of the circuit or the negative side of the circuit. A switch 
can be used to control a load device directly or used to operate a relay which in turn can 
operate a higher current device, (e.g. Headlight switch, Horn button and Window switch.) 

Pushbuttons and microswitches belong to the group of contact sensors. They generate a 
signal when they are subjected to a force (press, release). Switches and pushbuttons are 
often used to register certain statuses, e.g. whether a trunk lid is open or closed. 

Pushbuttons output a signal only for as long as they are operated. They then return to 
their rest position. 

When operated, switches lock in position and 
remain in the switching position, into which they 
were moved. They return to their initial position only 
when operated again and signal output is cancelled. 

Mechanical switches are operated mechanically. 

They have one or several switch contacts or contact 
paths.

Relays 

A Relay is a switch that uses electromagnetism to physically move the contacts. 

A small of amount of current flow through a relay coil moves an armature and opens or 
closes a set of points. 

The points control the flow of a larger amount of current through a separate circuit. 




Think of the two sides of a relay independently. 

• Control side: Which includes the B+(KL86) and B-(KL85) for the coil that creates the 
magnetic force. If this side of the relay fails open the work side points will remain in 
their at rest position. 

• Work side: Which includes the B+ input power (KL30) and the Relay output (KL87). 
Failure of this side of the relay in the closed position (sticking points) will result in 
constant current flow. 

BMW uses relays with various numbers of pins (3,4,5 pin) and pin configurations (normal¬ 
ly open, normally closed and changeover type). Do not substitute relays. Always 
replace with the same type (e.g. DME Main Power Relay, Secondary Air Pump Relay 
and Rear Window Defroster Relay.).

Electric Motors —®— 

There are a large number of electric motors installed in BMW vehicles, e.g. for the slide- 
tilt sunroof, power windows, seats, windshield wipers etc. 

Two types of electric motors are of particular interest: 

• Direct current motor 

• Stepper motors 

Direct Current Motor 

A direct current motor converts electrical energy 
into rotational energy. 

When current is passed through the armature of 
a DC motor, a torque is generated by magnetic 
reaction and the armature revolves. 

The motor consists of a fixed part, the stator, and 
a rotating part, the rotor (armature). Most direct 
current motors (DC motors) are designed as 
internal rotor motors. The rotor is the inner part 
and the stator the outer part. 

The stator consists of an electromagnet or a permanent magnet in smaller electric 
motors. The rotor is also known as the armature. 

The principle of the electric motor is based on the fact that a force is exerted on a current 
carrying conductor in a magnetic field. The magnetic field of the current-carrying conduc¬ 
tor and the magnetic field of the permanent magnet mutually influence each other. If the 
permanent magnet is fixed in position and the conductor is mounted such that it rotates, 
a force is exerted on the conductor causing it to rotate. 

This force is dependent on: 

• The strength of the electrical current in the conductor 

• The strength of the magnetic field 

• The effective length of the conductor (number of windings) 



35 

Basic Electricity 












Stepper Motors 

Stepper Motors behave differently than standard DC motors. Unlike DC motors which 
spin freely when power is applied, stepper motors do as their name suggests, they step 
or rotate incrementally a little bit at a time. While DC motors need higher speeds to pro¬ 
duce higher torque, stepper motors provide their highest torque at their slowest speeds. 
Stepper motors also have holding torque, the ability to resist movement by outside forces. 

Steppers are driven by the interaction (attraction and repulsion) of magnetic fields. The 
driving magnetic field rotates as strategically placed coils are switched on and off. This 
pushes and pulls at permanent magnets arranged around the rotor that drive the output shaft.

Stepper motors can be used successfully wherever controlled movements or positioning 
are required. They enable simple positioning control with a high degree of reliability and 
precision. They require a direct current supply, a control switch and control pulses (digital 
information) for their operation. The corresponding direct current is supplied to the motor 
via an electronic switch. 

Depending on the type of stepper motor, the standard step angle is in the range from 2° 
to 15°. 

The position which the shaft of the stepper motor assumes corresponds to the relation¬ 
ship between the number of magnetic poles of the stator and the number of magnetic 
poles of the rotor. Since the rotor is equipped with permanent magnets, the poles are 
correspondingly defined. The stator always consists of two or more pole pairs with each 
pole enclosed by a coil with current passing through it to form a magnetic pole. 

The magnetic field can be reversed by reversing the direction of current flow in the mag¬ 
net windings. A rotating magnetic field which the permanent magnets of the rotor follow 
is created by successively reversing the direction of current flow in the stator coils in one 
direction. The rotary speed is determined by the speed at which the stator coils are 
switched over. 

In BMW vehicles, stator motors are used, for example, in the integrated heating and air 
conditioning control system (IHKA) for controlling the air flaps (stratification, footwell, 
recirculating air and fresh air flaps).

The vehicle starter is a DC motor. It has the task of turning the crankshaft of the combus¬ 
tion engine at the minimum speed required to start the engine.

The principle of starting a combustion engine is based on a small gearwheel (pinion) 
engaging in the ring gear on the flywheel. Thanks to the large gear ratio between the pin¬ 
ion and ring gear on the flywheel (approx. 15:1), the starter requires only a low torque at 
high speed. This is why the starters are designed with compact dimensions. 

The starter consists of the following assemblies: 

• DC starter motor 

• Engagement relay 

• Meshing gear

By operating the start switch, the engagement relay and the meshing gear mesh the pin¬ 
ion with the ring gear on the flywheel. Following engagement of the pinion, the starter 
motor turn the crankshaft of the combustion engine with the aid of the pinion and ring 
gear. The pinion is disengaged as soon as the combustion engine starts up. The various 
types of starting differ in terms of the way the pinion is meshed or engaged with the ring 
gear. A pre-engaged drive starter with stepdown gear mechanism is used in BMW vehi¬ 
cles.

A planetary gear acting as a step-down gear mechanism is installed between the starter 
motor and the pinion. The planetary gear has the task of reducing the high speed of the 
starter while simultaneously boosting the torque at the pinion. Since the power output at 
the starter shaft is proportional to the speed, the power output of the starter can be 
increased or the dimensions reduced while retaining the same power output levels. 

The engagement procedure consists of two partial movements of the pinion: 

• Translatory (thrust) motion 

• Rotary (screwing) motion

After operating the start switch (2), the engagement lever (8) is moved by the solenoid (1). 
The pinion (11) is shifted forward (sprung) and made to rotate by the coarse pitch thread. 
If a tooth of the pinion (11) finds a tooth gap, it will engage immediately. If the tooth of the 
pinion comes up against a tooth of the flywheel (10), the spring on the pinion is com¬ 
pressed until the solenoid (1) switches on the current. The rotor (5) rotates and the pinion 
(11) slides along the end face of the ring gear (10) until it can engaged.

Alternator 

Each vehicle is equipped with its own power station - the alternator. 

The tasks of the alternator include: 

• To supply electrical loads with electrical energy while the engine is running 

• To charge the battery 



The first alternators were used in BMW vehicles over 70 years ago for the purpose of 
supplying power for the electrical lighting. 


40 

Basic Electricity 



The alternator converts mechanical energy into electri¬ 
cal energy. It is driven by the combustion engine using 
a V-ribbed drive belt. The alternator is mounted in a 
fixed position. The required belt tension is achieved 
with a belt tensioner and tensioning pulley. 



Alternator Principle 

The functional principle of the alternator is based on the inverse principle of the electric 
motor. Electromagnetic induction is also the basic requirement for operation of the alter¬ 
nator. 


The electrons in an electric conductor are displaced when it is moved in a magnetic field.

The magnetic field is produced by electromagnets. The Diagram of alternating voltage

In the stator there are three coils that are connected in "star" arrangement. The begin¬ 
nings of the coils are identified with the letters U, V, W while the star points are identified 
with the letter N. The coil terminals are connected to a rectifier circuit. An alternating volt¬ 
age is generated in each stator coil while the rotor (electromagnet) of the alternator 
rotates.

The arrangement of the coils in the stator ensures that the three generated alternating 
voltages are offset by 120° with respect to each other. 

The alternating currents create magnetic fields in the rotor windings whose strength and 
direction change continuously. The effect of these three magnetic fields together results 
in a magnetic rotary field.

The battery and the electrical system cannot store or use the 3-phase AC voltage pro¬

A circuit consisting of nine diodes then forms the direct voltage from the alternating volt¬ 
age.

Six diodes within diode rectifier bridge are used to achieve three-phase AC voltage rectifi¬ 
cation. Three diodes are positive biased and three are negative biased. 

The positive half-waves pass through the positive biased diodes and the negative half¬ 
waves through the negative biased diodes. 

The rectifier diodes in the generator not only convert the current but also prevent battery 
discharging through the 3 phase windings of the stator. Current flow can only take place 
from the generator to the battery. 

This direct voltage, however, would be dependent on the engine speed. This means the 
voltage would be low at idle speed and high at full load. A regulator is therefore installed 
with the purpose of maintaining a constant voltage. The regulator constantly compares 
the system voltage with the alternator voltage. The alternator voltage is regulated by 
changing the strength of the field current. The strength of the field current is not changed 
as long as the alternator voltage remains at 14 V. If the system voltage drops the field cur¬ 
rent in the rotor is increased and the voltage rises. However, the combustion engine must 
use more power to turn the rotor. The field current is interrupted if the alternator voltage 
exceeds the system voltage.

Intelligent Alternator Control 

Intelligent alternator control IGR is used in current BMW vehicles. IGR utilizes the previ¬ 
ously unused kinetic energy in coasting or overrun mode to drive the alternator. In this 
way, current is generated and made available to the vehicle electrical system without hav¬ 
ing to use engine power and therefore fuel. For this purpose, the charge status of the bat¬ 
tery must not be full at all times but rather must be within certain limits. When fully 
charge, a battery can take up no more energy. For this reason, the IGR reduces the 
charge level. An intelligent sensor at the negative terminal of the vehicle battery as well as 
a communication interface at the alternator are required for the IGR function. 

Note: Intelligent alternator control is described in detail in the F07 Complete 
Vehicle training material.
