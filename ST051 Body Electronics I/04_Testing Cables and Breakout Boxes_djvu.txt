Electrical Repair 


Electrical Repair Kit IV 

The Electrical Repair Kits (1,11,111 and IV) have 
gone through various upgrades. 

Electrical Repair Kit IV (PN 90 88 619 020) 
has been developed to handle repairs of the 
specialized state of the art wiring and har¬ 
nesses of the newest BMW products. 

Caution: 

The special tools contained in the Electrical 
Repair Kits 1,11,111 are not state of the art and are 
not suitable for specialized wiring harness 
repairs. 



Use exclusively Electrical Repair Kit IV for those 
repairs. 


Electrical Repair Kit IV (61 9 020) 

Contains the following: 

61 9 041 Crimping Tool 
61 9 042 Matrix 
61 9 043 Cable Stripper 
61 9 044 Matrix 
Assorted Individual Parts 


Cable Stripper 

Special Tool 61 9 043 Cable stripper with 
wire cutter for cutting and stripping insula¬ 
tion from cables. 

Crimping Tool 

Special Tool 61 9 041 Crimping Tool with 
special tool 61 9 044 (matrix) for crimping 
cable guide and strain relief device on anten¬ 
na elbow plug. 

Supplementary kits for Electrical Repair Kit IV are 
released periodically. Check the latest Service Bulletin 
to insure information on latest connectors are avail¬ 
able. 



26 

Testing Cables and Breakout Boxes 















Cable Stripping 

Proper wire stripping and connector replace¬ 
ment is essential to ensure the integrity of the 
electrical connection. Always follow specific 
instructions in the Electrical Repair Kit IV 
instruction manual as well as Group 61-13 
repair manual found in the TIS. 

The length of wire to be stripped is deter¬ 
mined by the wire gauge. 


Wire cross-section size 

Stripped length: 

mm 2 

mm 

0.35 ... 0.50 

4.0 

0.75 ... 1.00 

4.5 

1.00... 2.50 

5.0 



Proper use of the wire stripping tool will pro¬ 
vide consistently positive results. Insert the 
wire (1) into the stripper. Stop the wire when 
the required strip length is past the cutter (2). 
Squeeze the handle of the tool. 



When the top jaw of the tool touches the wire 
(3) the mechanism shifts the clamping action 
to a pulling action which strips the wire of the 
insulation (4). 



27 

Testing Cables and Breakout Boxes 














Crimping Tool 


Use the wire crimper from the BMW 
Electrical Repair Kit. This crimper is 
designed for the specific connectors found in 
BMW automobiles. Proper use of the tools 
will provide consistent good quality connec¬ 
tor crimps. 

The crimper is designed to apply just the 
right amount of pressure based on the wire 
gauge and connector size. 

The tool has removable crimper jaws (3). This 
feature allows for an unlimited number of 
connector types for future compatibility. The 
repair manual refers to the different sized 
crimping slots as “Nests”. The gauge of the 
wire being crimped determines which “Nest” 
is used. 


Nest 

Wire cross-section size 

1 

0.35... 0.50mm 2 

2 

0.75... 1.00mm 2 

3 

1.50mm 2 

4 

2.50mm 2 


Example: 

A .75 -1 .Omm gauge wire requires nest 2 for 
proper crimping. 

Throughout the Electrical Repair Kit instruc¬ 
tion manual are illustrations of various con¬ 
nectors being crimped. The highlighted box 
of the 16 box grid in these illustrations refers 
to the storage compartment in the electrical 
kit drawers in which that specific connector 
can be found. 

Insert the “crimping end” of the connector 
into the appropriate “nest”. Illustration pro¬ 
vides example of comb replacement connec¬ 
tor (4) and inline splice connector (5). 




28 

Testing Cables and Breakout Boxes 













Squeeze the tool handle slightly to set the 
tool in the first ratchet latch position. This will 
hold the connector in the tool without closing 
the crimp (6). 

Insert the stripped wire into the receiving end 
of the crimper tool making sure the wire is 
inserted far enough to ensure that only the 
wire insulation will be inside the insulation 
support barrel (7). 

Properly crimped connectors exhibit the fol¬ 
lowing characteristics: 



• The insulation support barrel will be 
crimped consistently and snug against 
the insulation. The insulation will not be 
crushed (8). 

• A bellmouth crimp will be visible at the 
wire end of the of the wire barrel (9). 

• Wire strands will be visible at the contact 
end of the wire barrel (10). 

• Insulation end will be visible in this area 
(11) (Fig. 27/1). 


The following are examples of unacceptable crimps: (Fig. 27/2) 

• Excessive or no wire strands at the contact end of the wire barrel (10). 

• Excessive or no insulation end in the acceptable area (11). 



Testing Cables and Breakout Boxes 









Prepackaged Wiring Repair Sets 

Included with the Electrical Repair Kit IV are a 
variety of wiring repair sets. These sets con¬ 
tain various pre-crimped wiring connectors on 
assorted gauge wire lengths for simple splice 
connection repair into a wiring harness. 

The repair kits also contain: 

1. Various gauge lengths of wire 
with pre-crimped connectors. 

2. In-line splice connectors. 

3. Heat shrink tubing. 

When used correctly the in-line splice con¬ 
nectors provide a BMW factory approved wire 
crimp. Use the correct size nest in the 
crimper tool and connect one side of the in¬ 
line crimp with the wire. 

Slide a piece of heat shrink tubing on the wire 
and crimp the other side of the in-line con¬ 
nector. 

Use a heat gun to shrink the tube around the 
splice connector to provide a moisture resis¬ 
tant seal. 


Part numbers for the wire sets or any compo¬ 
nent of all four electrical repair kits can be re¬ 
ordered from: 

• The P/N reference card inside each 
repair kit. 

• Special tools microfiche. 

• The Electrical Repair Kit 1 -4 compo¬ 
nent catalog (SD 92-036). 





As new connectors are developed for new vehicles, the repair kits will be announced by 
Service Information bulletins and sent to dealerships via automatic tools shipment.

Soldering Connections 


In the event that a wiring connection must be 
soldered in a vehicle’s electrical system, there 
are certain procedures which must be fol¬ 
lowed. Improper soldering will result in poor 
electrical connections or damage to electrical 
components. 

SAFETY: Adhere to the following basic 

guidelines when preparing to 
solder. 

• Safety glasses must be worn. 

• Disconnect vehicle battery. 

• Cover vehicle trim surfaces. 

• Exercise your common sense. 

• Provide adequate ventilation, 
it’s the best safety precaution! 

Soldering Preparation and Procedure 

• The wire insulation must be stripped to 
expose an adequate amount of bare wire 
(not too little-not to much.) 

• The wires and or connectors must be 
clean and free of grease, dirt, wax, etc. 

• A thin coating of rosin core flux must be 
applied to the soldering connection. 



PREHEAT 



DON'T 
BURN 

INSULATION 


Have enough 60/40 (tin/lead) general electrical solder on hand prior to starting. 
If heat transfer to a heat sensitive component is possible use “heat sinks”. 


Use a soldering gun tip that is the right size for the job. Do not use an overly large 
tip which could melt wire insulation and block your view of what is being soldered. 

The soldering tip must be “tinned”. This means to keep a thin layer of solder on the 
tip at all times during soldering. This will transfer the heat quickly and allow the sol¬ 
der to flow easily into the joint being soldered. 

Preheat the wires or connector. Introduce the solder into the joint not the soldering 
tip. 

When the solder starts to flow allow it to infiltrate the joint only for a moment. 

Almost simultaneously, pull the tip off of the joint to prevent overheating. 

A properly soldered joint will be smooth, shinny, and even surfaced.

Break Out Boxes and V Cables, 
Tester and Adapter Sets 


Breakout Boxes and “V” Cables 

Breakout Boxes are used to: 

• Provide a convenient “tap” into an electrical circuit. 

• Minimize the possibility of damage to control unit connections and wire harnesses 
during diagnosis of electrical/electronic systems. 

• Ensure solid meter connections for proper diagnosis, this in turn will help the tech¬ 
nician to be more organized and efficient. 

• Provide easier access to circuits fortesting with equipment such as, multimeter, 
DISplus tester or other diagnostic tools. 

CAUTION: Breakout box cable connections are universal in order to fit the 

varying coded connectors found in the vehicles. Always confirm 
that you are connecting the correct control module into the sys¬ 
tem harness that is on the other side of the breakout box. System 
damage will occur if it is not the correct system. 


Example: DME and EGS/AGS control modules both utilize an 88 or 134 pin control 
module. These control modules reside in the same E-Box on most vehicles. The con¬ 
trol modules are coded to prevent unintentional cross connecting at the vehicle harness. 
But, this connector coding is not present on the 88 or 134 pin breakout box(s). Result: 
A DME control module could be connected to a transmission control system. 
Damage will result! 

Several different types of breakout boxes are available depending on the particular sys¬ 
tem being diagnosed.

“V” Cables 


“V” cables are available in different versions 
depending on the system being diagnosed. 
Always refer to the most recent Service infor¬ 
mation for the required special tools. 


“V” cables are only used with the 26 pin break¬ 
out box to access input and output signals of 
peripheral modules and systems. 


• The appropriate cable is distinguished by the color of the connector end. 

• The color will match the particular modules connector color. Unless the color 
matches, the cable will not fit the connector on the module being tested. 

• Each colored “V” cable has a series of alignment tabs that will only fit it’s particular 
module or system. 

“V” cables with ELO connectors are also being used with the 26 pin breakout box. 
These cables are unique in that they have a locking arm on the component side of the 
cable. They are light green in color, and the number of pins will vary depending on the 
system being tested. 

“V” harness adapters were introduced with the E38. These also have light green ELO 
connectors on the component side, but they do not require a breakout box. There is a 
black plug on one side with same number of pins as the component being tested. The 
plug has numbers stamped on it’s side that corresponds with the pins on that particular 
component. You access the signals by plugging the test equipment directly into those 
pin numbers. 

As new systems and components are being introduced, new breakout boxes and cables 
will also be introduced. 

Always remember to refer to the most recent service information in TIS or Service 
Information Bulletins for the latest diagnostic tools and procedures.

Important Notes Concerning Airbag Repairs: 

Only repair those cables which show visible signs of damage. If there is visible damage, make sure 
that only one cable repair is present after repairing. If no visible damage can be identified, the entire 
cable must be replaced. When carrying out repairs to the airbag wiring harness use only those parts 
specified in the EPC as “Airbag Repair Cable”.
