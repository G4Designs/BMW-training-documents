Semiconductor Technology 


Semiconductors are materials whose conductivity is between that of metals with very 
good conductivity and insulators. Semiconductors are contaminated for the purpose of 
specifically influencing or controlling their conductivity. In technical terms this is referred 
to as doping. The doping process involves incorporating external atoms of varying valen¬ 
cy in a defined crystal structure. 

The conductivity of semiconductors is low at room temperature. The conductivity 
changes by subjecting semiconductors to energy in the form of heat, light, voltage or 
magnetic energy. The sensitivity of semiconductors to pressure, temperature and light 
also makes them the ideal material for sensors. 

Semiconductor components are mainly produced from the semiconductor materials sili¬ 
con (Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs). 

Germanium (Ge) was used particularly in the early years of semiconductor technology as 
the raw material for manufacturing transistors but is of little significance today due to its 
low boundary layer temperature of 75 °C. 

A silicon crystal comprises a solid structure of individual silicon atoms. Each atom has 4 
electrons in its outer shell, known as valent electrons. On each side of the atom, a valent 
electron combines with the corresponding electron of the neighboring element to form 
an electronic compound. In this way, each atom forms 4 fixed electron pair bonds with 
the respective neighboring atom. 

In its solid state, pure silicon therefore forms a crystalline lattice which has high-resis¬ 
tance characteristics, i.e. it is a poor conductor. 

The conductivity of the pure silicon crystal can be 
increased by specifically contaminating it with substances 
of higher or lower valent. The incorporation of external 
atoms in the silicon crystal lattice is known as "doping". 

Semiconductors are doped for the purpose of specifically 
influencing or controlling their conductivity. A distinction is 
made between p-doping and n-doping depending on the 
element that is added to the pure silicon. 

A boundary layer known as the pn-junction is produced by combining p-conductive and 
n-conductive material.

N-Doping 

When contaminating a silicon crystal with a pentavalent element such as phosphorous, 
the phosphorus atom can easily slip into the silicon crystal structure. However, a phos¬ 
phorus atom has five valent electrons, of which only four can form a fixed electron pair 
bond with the neighboring silicon atoms. 

One free electron therefore remains surplus. 

The phosphorus atom that was incorporated in 
the silicon crystal therefore forms an imperfection 
with a surplus electron. The crystal dopes in this 
way is an n-semiconductor. 

In practical applications, the structure is formed 
such that one phosphorus atom is added to every 
million silicon atoms. The degree of doping of the 
silicon with phosphorus is therefore very weak. 

This type of doped material is called negative or N-material, because it already has 
excess electrons and will repel additional negative charges. 

P-Doping 

In the case of p-doping, a trivalent element such a boron is added to a silicon crystal. 

A boron atom has three electrons in its outermost electron orbit, however, it requires 
four electrons for it to combine with its four neigh¬ 
boring elements to produce a covalent atomic 
bond. A "hole" remains in the place where an 
electron is missing. The crystal doped with this 
electron hole is known as a p-semiconductor. 

The electron holes have a propensity to absorb 
electrons in order to become neutral again. 

This type of doped material is called positive or P- 
material because it will attract free electrons. 

Junctions 

Doping Germanium and Silicone cause them to behave in unusual but predictable ways 
when exposed to voltage, depending on which charge of the voltage is connected to 
which type of material (P or N). 

The line along which joined P and N material meet is called the Junction. A simple 
component consisting of P-material and N-material joined at a junction is called a diode. 
The application of voltage to the two doped semiconductor materials is called biasing. 

A more complex material containing two PN junctions is called a Transistor.

Electronic Signals and Components 


The different types of doping therefore produce two different semiconductors. By joining 
p-conductive material and n-conductive material a boundary layer is produced between 
the materials known as the pn-junction. Under the influence of ambient heat, the elec¬ 
trons at the boundary layer of both zones migrate from the n-semiconductorto the p- 
semiconductor while taking on electron holes. The electrons leave behind electron holes 
in the n-conductor. In this way, a space-charge zone is produced at the boundary 
between p- and n-semiconductors. 

The electron migration is terminated when the electric field is large enough to counteract 
the force exerted by the thermal vibration. The higher the temperature, the wider the 
space charge zone and therefore the greater the electric field. An electrical voltage is pro¬ 
duced between the space-charges. This voltage is 0.6 V to 0.7 V for silicon at a tempera¬ 
ture of 20°C.

By applying the positive pole of the voltage source to the n-semiconductor and the nega¬ 
tive pole to the p-semiconductor, the surplus electrons of the n-doped semiconductor 
migrate through the current source into the electron holes of the p-doped semiconductor. 
This increases the boundary layer (junction) and no current flows through the silicon 
crystal.

Electronic Components 


Diodes 

The component produced by joining the p-semiconductor and n-semiconductor is 
referred to as a semiconductor diode, abbreviated to diode. 

A plastic or metal housing protects the semiconductor crystal from mechanical damage. 
Electrically, the two semiconductor layers are routed to the outside. The anode forms the 
contact with the p-layer and the cathode the contact with the n-layer. 

The following graphic symbol is used in schematic circuit diagrams.

The arrow shown in the graphic symbol indicates the conducting direction. 


The diode acts as an electrical valve. It can therefore be used 
as a component for rectifying alternating current. The diode is 
switched in conducting direction when a positive voltage is 
applied at the diode and current flows through the diode. The 
current is limited by the load resistor to ensure it does not destroy 
the diode. The diode is switched in non-conductive direction 
when a negative voltage is applied at the anode and no current 
flows through the diode. An excessively high voltage in non-con¬ 
ducting direction can destroy the diode. 



The two connections of a diode are distinguished by the identification of the "n-side" 
with a ring ora dot. In BMW vehicles, the diode is used both as an individual component 
as well as in integrated circuits in control units. 


A diode acts as a valve. It has a low resistance when operated in conducting direction 
and a high resistance when operated in nonconducting direction. Fora diode to be con¬ 
ductive, its anode must be more positive than the cathode by the forward voltage. 


In motor vehicle electrical systems, diodes are used as rectifiers, decoupling elements, 
for suppressing induced voltages and as reverse voltage protection elements.

Light Emitting Diode 

As other diodes, the light-emitting diode (LED) consists of two semiconductor layer, one 
player and one n-layer. They are not made from silicon but rather from gallium arsenide. 


LEDs are available in various colors (green, yellow, red, blue,...) shapes and sizes. 
The color of the LED depends on the materials used. 

This graphic symbol is used to denote an LED. LEDs 
must always be connected to a series resistor for the 
purpose of limiting the current that flows through the 
LED. 

The n-layer of an LED is very strongly doped 
whereas the p-layer is only weakly doped. This 
ensures that the current is carried almost exclu¬ 
sively by the electrons when the diode is operated 
in conducting direction. Energy is released during 
the recombination of holes and electrons in the p- 
layer. Depending on the material of the semicon¬ 
ductor, this energy is released in the form of visible 
light or as infrared radiation. The light can escape 
as the p-layer is very thin.

The advantages of LEDs compared to bulbs: 

• Much longer service live (approx. 100 times 
longer) 

• No sudden failure but rather decrease in light 
intensity over a longer period of time 

• Faster response time 

• Mechanically unsusceptible

Z-diode 


Z-diodes (Zener diodes) are operated in nonconducting 
direction. When a certain voltage UZ is exceeded in non¬ 
conducting direction, the current IZ increases substan¬ 
tially so that the diode becomes conductive. As the result 
of a high degree of doping, the nonconducting layer can 
be made very thin so that the breakdown already occurs 
at voltages between 1 V and 200 V. The current must be 
limited by a corresponding resistor to ensure the sharp 
increase in current in connection with the breakdown 
voltage does not destroy the diode.

and for limiting voltage peaks.

PNP transistor 


Transistors are electronic components made up of three semiconductor layers. 

Each semiconductor layer has its own electrical connection. A distinction is made 
between PNP transistors and NPN transistors depending on the arrangement of the 
semiconductor layers. The three semiconductor layers with their connections are known 
as emitter (E), base (B) and collector (C). The charge carriers move from the emitter to 
the base (they are emitted) and are received by the collector.

PNP transistor 


Transistors are electronic components consisting of three semiconductor layers. A dis¬ 
tinction is made between PNP transistors and NPN transistors corresponding to the 
arrangement of the semiconductor layers. 

Transistors are used for the purpose of switching small currents in motor vehicle electri¬ 
cal/electronic systems. The acute temperature sensitivity of semiconductors is utilized for 
temperature-dependent resistors. 

The transistor therefore consists of two PN junctions, the one between the emitter and 
base and the other between the collector and base. 

Functional Principle 

The functional principle is explained in the following using the example of an NPN transis¬ 
tor. The PNP transistor operates in accordance with the same principle, however, the cur¬ 
rents flow in the opposite direction. 

The illustration in the following figure shows the principle layout of a transistor with its 
three connections: emitter, base and collector.

The number of electrons in the emitter is very high. There are only few holes in the base. 
The negatively charged electrons transfer to the base layer due to the positive voltage 
UBE. Here, the electrons combine with the holes. Supply of the positively charged holes 
maintained in the form of a very small current from the base-emitter voltage source. 

The remaining electrons in the base area come under the influence of the positive collec¬ 
tor voltage when a very low voltage is applied between the collector and emitter. 

The collector-base barrier layer is cancelled and a collector current 1C flows. 

The boosting effect of the transistor is attributed to the fact that a very large collector cur¬ 
rent can be controlled with few charge carriers in the base area, i.e. with a very low base 
current. 


A lower base-emitter voltage transfers only a part of the electrons in the emitter to the 
base so that a low collector current flows. The collector current 1C can be controlled by 
changing the base current IB. The base emitter battery shown in the illustration above is 
replaced by a voltage divider in practical applications. 


A slight change in the base current results in a large change in the collector current. In 
view of the largely linear relationship between the collector current and base current this 
change is defined as the static current gain B:

Transistor as a Switch 

Electric loads in motor vehicle electrical/ electronic systems are switched on and off by 
means of mechanical and electronic switches. The transistor is suitable for switching very 
low currents. 

Mechanical switches are replaced by transistors as transistors operate faster and silently 
and are not subject to mechanical wear. 

The actual switch is the collector-emitter stage of the transistor. 

No base current can flow if the transistor receives no base voltage. This therefore means 
that no collector current can flow. A base current and a collector current flows when the 
transistor receives a positive base voltage.

Field-effect Transistors 


The field-effect transistor, mostly abbreviated to FET, is a unipolar transistor. Unipolar 
because, in contrast to the bipolar transistor considered up until now, depending on the 
type, either only holes or only electrons are involved in the flow of current. 


The following types of field-effect transistor are used: 

• Junction-gate field-effect transistor 

• Insulated-gate field-effect transistor 

• Metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)

Structure of a field-effect transistor 


The N-channel of the FET shown above is the conductive area. The electric field is influ¬ 
enced by a voltage applied at the control electrode (gate). The flow of current through the 
conductive channel of the field-effect transistor is controlled by the electric field. 

The barrier junction (space-charge zone) expands when the gate voltage is increased. 
The current through the N-channel is constricted and therefore decreased. 

The barrier junction becomes smaller and the current through the N-channel greater by 
reducing the gate voltage. Varying the width of the barrier junction requires virtually no 
power. 

Therefore, only a low blocking-state current flows which cannot be prevented due to the 
intrinsic conductivity of semiconductor crystals.

FETs are used as switches and constant current sources due to the low power con¬

PTC and NTC Resistors 

The considerable temperature sensitivity of semiconductors is utilized in temperature 
dependent resistors. 

Such resistors are known as NTC resistors (Negative Temperature Coefficient) and PTC 
resistors (Positive Temperature Coefficient). 


NTC Resistor 

NTC resistors are semiconductor resistors whose resistance decreases as temperature 
increases. They have a strongly negative temperature coefficient. 


The diagram shows the resistance progression on an 
NTC resistor as a function of temperature. 

The most important characteristic value of an NTC 
resistor is the resistor R20, denoting its resistance at 
20 °C, i.e. the resistance of the NTC when cold. 

To compensate for internal temperature effects, an NTC 
resistor is operated with low current so that the ambient 
temperature is a decisive factor governing the resis¬ 
tance. 

The following graphic symbol is used for the NTC resis¬ 
tor in circuit schematics

The opposing arrows represent the inverse relationship between resistance and tempera¬ 
ture. (High temperature — > low resistance Low temperature —> high resistance) 

NTC resistors with no intrinsic increase in temperature are used as sensors for measuring 
temperature. They are also used to stabilize temperatures in analogue circuits. 

PTC Resistors 

PTC resistors are semiconductor resistors whose resistance increases with rising tem¬ 
perature.

resistance increases substantially as from the nominal resistance RN. The operating 
range of the PTC extends up to the final temperature TE. 


The following graphic symbol is used in schematic circuit diagrams. 



Similar to NTC resistors, PTC resistors are used as temperature sensors, 
e.g. in air conditioning systems.

Capacitors 

The capacitor is a component that can store electrical charge or electrical energy. 

The simplest form of a capacitor consists of two opposing metal plates with an insulator 
between them. 

Capacitors store electrical energy in an electrical 
field. Corresponding to their design, a differentia¬ 
tion is made between: 

• Non-polarized capacitors 

• Polarized capacitors 

They are used for smoothing rectified voltages 
and for the purpose of creating time delays. 

The storage capacity of a capacitor is referred to 
as electrical capacitance. The unit of measure for 
capacitance is Farad (F).

In non-polarized capacitors, both connections are equivalent, i.e. they can be inter¬ 
changed. Non-polarized capacitors can be used with direct and alternating voltage. 

Polarized capacitors, on the other hand, have a positive and a negative connection. 
The two connections must not be interchanged. 

Polarized capacitors must not be used with alternating voltage.

Capacitor 


Electrical charges are displaced when a direct voltage source is applied to the capacitor 
by closing the switch. A surplus of electrons occurs on the one plate (negative charge) 
while a deficit of electrons occurs on the other plate (positive charge). 

Consequently, a charge current flows until the capacitor is fully charged. The current flow 
can be determined with an ammeter. 

When the capacitor is fully charged, current no longer flows (ammeter shows 0 A) even 
when the voltage source remains connected. 

The capacitor then blocks the direct current, i.e. the resistance of the capacitor becomes 
infinitely great. 

The capacitor remains charged after it is disconnected from the direct voltage source, i.e. 
the differential between the electrons prevails between the plates. 

The capacitor stores the electrical energy. 

A discharge current flows in the opposite direction when the capacitor is short-circuited 
by flicking the switch. The discharge current flows until both plates are electrically neutral 
again or until the electrical energy in the resistor has been converted to thermal energy.

Voltage 


Initially, high current flows during the capacitor charging procedure. On the other hand, 
the voltage is initially low or equals 0 V. As the capacitor charges up, the current decreas¬ 
es and the voltage increases. Current no longer flows when the capacitor is fully charged. 
The voltage reaches the value of the voltage source. 

Initially, when the capacitor is discharged, high current flows but in the opposite direction 
of charging. Initially, the voltage is at its maximum value but constantly drops as the 
capacitor is discharged. Current no longer flows when the capacitor is fully discharged 
and there is no difference in potential between the plates of the capacitor. 

If the number of charge and discharge cycles is increased per unit of time, e.g. by apply¬ 
ing alternating voltage, the number of charging and discharging currents per unit of time 
will increase so that the mean value of the current per unit of time also increases. As a 
result, the current in the capacitor is greater, i.e. the resistance of the capacitor is appar¬ 
ently less (capacitive reactance). 

Note: Capacitors are used in motor vehicles as short-term charge storage facil¬ 
ities for smoothing voltages and for minimizing overvoltage peaks.

Capacitance 

The ability of a capacitor to store electricity is referred to as capacitance. The unit of mea¬ 
sure for capacitance is Farad (F). 

Capacitors used in practical applications have values that are less than one Farad: 

• 1 mF = 10-3 F (mF = millifarad) 

• 1 pF = 10-6 F (pF = microfarad) 

• 1 nF = 10-9 F (nF = nanofarad) 

• 1 pF = 10-12 F (pF = picofarad) 

Charge and Discharge Time of a Capacitor 

The value of the resistor, through which the charge current of the capacitor flows and the 
value of the capacitor are required for the purpose of calculating the charge and dis¬ 
charge time. The level of the applied voltage has no influence on the charging time. 

Charging takes place faster the smaller the capacitance of the capacitor C and the smaller 
the resistance R. 

The product of capacitor C and resistor R is therefore defined as a time constant T (tau). 

T = R * C 


A capacitor charges or discharges at a rate of 63 % of the applied or charged voltage 
within each time constant t (tau). A capacitor is almost fully charged or discharged after 
5 time constants.

Resistors — 1=1 — 

Resistors limit the current flow in a circuit. The resistor is used in a circuit to introduce a 
desired amount of resistance into the circuit. 

Resistors are available in fixed resistance or variable resistance. Fixed resistors are color 
coded to indicate their resistance. 

In view of the fact that the resistance of power supply lines is an undesirable effect in the 
majority of cases, in electronics it is often necessary to limit the current in a current circuit 
to a defined value. Resistors are used for this purpose with their type and size depending 
on the respective application. 

Since resistors are often very small and their value cannot be printed on the component 
or is difficult to read off, the rating is often indicated by colored rings. Each color repre¬ 
sents a certain value so that the resistor rating can be determined by adding the individual 
values of the rings. The value indicated on the resistor applies only at a temperature of 20 
°C. This restriction is necessary as the resistance of various materials changes with tem¬ 
perature.

Variable Resistors 


Thermistor / 1 

The resistance of materials can vary with 
changes in temperature; therefore, resistors can 
have a changing resistance value dependent on 
temperature. 

A Thermistor is a resistor that can achieve large 
changes in resistance with small changes in 
temperature. 

Thermistors are normally of the NTC (negative 
temperature coefficient) type. As the tempera¬ 
ture increases the resistance decreases. 

(See NTC and PTC resistors section for more 
information)

Potentiometer —h=>— 

A Potentiometer (pot) is a variable resistor capa¬ 
ble of changing resistance values. 

Potentiometers have three terminals. One of 
the terminals is supply voltage, usually 5 volts. 
One of the terminals is the control module 
ground, and the third terminal is for the input 
signal into the control module. (Output from 
the Pot.) 



Potentiometers are used to measure mechani¬ 
cal movement, (e.g. EDR feedback) 


Rheostat —5^— 

A Rheostat is similar in operation to a potentiometer except a Rheostat only has two con¬ 
nectors. This arrangement allows the resistance to be varied between those two connec¬ 
tors.

Integrated Circuits 

An integrated circuit (1C) is an electronic circuit consisting of transistors, capacitors, resis¬ 
tors and inductances that is fully integrated in or on one single piece of semiconductor 
substrate. 

Modern integrated circuits such as memory 
chips can contain several hundred millions of 
components (especially transistors). 

Up until the 1950s, electronic circuits featured a 
discrete layout, i.e. the individual components 
such as resistor, capacitor, coil, diode ... were 
soldered on to pc-boards (pcbs) and intercon¬ 
nected by wires or printed conductors. 

The first integrated circuits in series production 
were introduced in the early 1960s and simply 
consisted of up to 30 to 40 transistors. 

Today's processors consist of almost 100 mil¬ 
lion transistors covering an area of little more 
than one square centimeter. Memory chips con¬ 
tain a billion transistors on the same area. 

Integrated Circuit Manufacturing 

The base material (substrate) of the majority (more than 99 %) of integrated circuits is sil¬ 
icon which is also the active material for transistors. Other materials such as gallium 
arsenide are used for very high volume or optical applications. Integrated circuits are pro¬ 
duced industrially in large quantities. They are produced in an extremely clean environ¬ 
ment, in so-called clean rooms with a very low density of dust particles. This is necessary 
as even the smallest particles (< 0.1 pm) can cause a complete circuit to fail. 



Several ICs are combined to 
form an integrated circuit

Electronic Signals and Components 


Control Units 

Control units are electronic modules which are mainly installed in locations where some¬ 
thing needs to be controlled or regulated. In motor vehicles, control units are used in all 
conceivable electronic applications. Control units are also used for the purpose of con¬ 
trolling machines, installations and other technical processes, e.g. engine control unit. 

In the early years of electronic engine control, control units were mainly used for ignition 
systems. Since 1987, they have also been used for electronic control of diesel engines. 



Control units generally operate in accordance with the input-processing-output principle 
(IPO). Sensors provide the input data by determining a physical variable such as engine 
speed, pressure, temperature, etc. 

This value is compared to a specified value entered or calculated in the control unit. If the 
measured value does not agree with the stored value, the control unit adjusts the physical 
process with the aid of actuators so that the measured actual values agree with the target 
values. The actuators therefore intervene in a corrective function in the current process. 

Today's control units are interconnected by means of various system busses (CAN, byte- 
flight). The control units use the busses to exchange information relating to the operating 
statuses and other relevant data in the vehicle. 

Today there are more than 60 control units installed in a vehicle such as the E60 (and ris¬ 
ing).

Purpose of Electronic Signals 


Electronic signals move information much like cars move passengers down the highway. 
It would be difficult to get to work without transportation, and there would be no trans¬ 
portation with out signals. 

Signals allow devices (e.g. sensors or switches) to communicate with control modules 
(either complicated processors or simple relays) which in turn perform or request 
(through more signaling) other functions to be carried out. 

Signals inform the Climate Control of the outside air temp or tell the brake lights the right 
time to illuminate. 

The use of electronic signals goes far beyond the basic application of electron flow to 
control components, enabling complex information to be passed from one component 
to another. 


The data (input or output) is conveyed through various forms of changing voltages, resis¬ 
tances, current or frequency modulation. 


Signals are divided into TWO main groups:

AC Voltage Signals 


Inductive Signals (Induced Voltage) 

Inductive sensors produce an AC Sine Wave signal. The AC voltage is induced by the 
shifting of a magnetic field. The sensor consists of an impulse wheel (the moving part) 
and a coil wound magnetic core (the stationary part). 

As each tooth of the impulse wheel approaches the sensor tip, the magnetic field of the 
sensor shifts toward the impulse wheel and induces a voltage pulse in the windings. 

As the teeth move away from the sensor, the magnetic field shifts back inducing a voltage 
pulse in the opposite direction. 

This shifting of the magnetic field produces an alternating current (positive to negative). 

Control modules which receive this alternating current, count the impulses (shifts from 
positive to negative) and interpret the speed of rotation of the impulse wheel.

Analog signals transmit information through an electrical circuit by regulating or changing 
the current or voltage. 

The voltage of the signal has no fixed value. The value may be anywhere in the operating 
range of the signal. 

Three sources of analog signals are: 

• NTC Sensors 

• PTC Sensors 

• Potentiometers 


DC Analog Sensors 

NTC Sensors 

NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) sensors change resistance based on temperature. 

As the temperature goes up the resistance goes down. This decrease in resistance caus¬ 
es the voltage drop across the sensor to decrease and the input signal voltage at the con 
trol module decreases.

PTC Sensor 

PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) sensors also change resistance based on tem¬ 
perature. In a PTC sensor as the temperature goes up the resistance also goes up. 
The increase in resistance causes the voltage drop across the sensor to increase and 
the input voltage signal at the control module increases. 

When troubleshooting a faulty input display, the input signal must be verified as 
“good” BEFORE the control module is replaced. 

When checking a NTC Sensor look for these voltages and problems: 

• Ov = no supply voltage or shorted to ground. 

• 2v = sensor is indicating a warm condition for system being measured. 

• 4v = sensor is indicating a cold condition for system being measured. 

• 5v = sensor or wiring harness is open. 


Note: Remember a PTC type sensor will indicate opposite results on 
intermediate readings (i.e. 4 volts = warm). 


Typical Application of NTC Type sensor: 

• Engine Coolant Temp Sensor 

• Transmission Temp Sensor 

• T-MAP Sensor 

• IHKA interior air temp sensor 

Note: For more information see the NTC and PTC resistor section of this 
training material.

Electronic Signals and Components 



Potentiometers 

A Potentiometer produces a gradually changing voltage signal to a control module. 
The signal is infinitely variable within the operating range of the sensor. 

This varying voltage reflects a mechanical movement or position of the potentiometer 
wiper arm and its related components. 


Potentiometer Wiper Arm: 

Input signal control, varies 
the input signal voltage by 
the position of the wiper arm 
on the sliding contact.

DC Digital Voltage Signals 

Digital Signals transfer information through an 
electrical circuit by switching the current on or 
off. Unlike analog signals which vary voltage, a 
digital signal has only two possible states, con¬ 
trol voltage or 0 voltage. 

Two types of Digital Signals: 

• Switched (High/Low) Signals 

• Modulated Square Wave signals

Modulated Square Wave 

A Modulated Square Wave is a series of 
High/Low signals repeated rapidly. 

Like the switched signals (B+, B-) the square 
wave has only two voltage levels. 

A high level and a low level. 

A modulated square wave has 3 characteristics that can be modified to vary the signal: 

• Frequency 

• Pulse Width 

• Duty Cycle 

■ Frequency 

The frequency of a modulated square wave signal is the number of complete cycles or 
pulses that occur in one second. This number of cycles or frequency is expressed in 
Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 complete cycle per second. 

An output function may use a fixed or varied frequency.

■ Pulse Width 

The Pulse Width of a signal is the length of time a pulse is on. Vehicle systems may use 
fixed or varied ON times/pulse width. Pulse width is expressed in milliseconds (ms). 


Pulse Width: 

Time it takes for 
active portion of 
cycle in millisec¬ 
onds (ie. 50ms). 


Pulse Width 


Period: 

Time it takes for one full cycle in 
milliseconds (ie. 100ms). 


■ Duty Cycle 

The Duty Cycle of a square wave is the ratio of ON time to OFF time for one cycle. Duty 
cycle is expressed in %. 

Vehicle systems use both fixed duty cycle signals and variable duty cycle signals.

DC Digital Sensors 

Hall Effect Sensors 

Hall Effect Sensors can be used to produce ON/OFF signals or modulated square wave. 

Hall Effect Sensors are electronic switches that react to magnetic fields to rapidly control 
the flow of current or voltage ON and OFF It consists of an epoxy filled non-magnetic 
housing containing a hall element and a magnet, and a trigger wheel. 

The Hall element is a thin non-magnetic plate which is electrically conductive. (Voltage will 
flow through the plate.) Electron flow is equal on both sides of the plate. 

Since everything between the magnet and the hall element is non-magnetic the magnet 
(magnetic field) has no effect on the current flow. 



SIGNAL 


EPOXY 

FILLED 

HOUSING 


HALL ELEMENT 


PERMANENT 

MAGNET 



As a metal disk or solid area of a toothed wheel, flywheel or other trigger device approach¬ 
es the sensor, a magnetic field is created between the magnet and the disk. This magnetic 
field cause the electron flow to stop on one side of the plate. Electrons continue to flow on 
the other side of the plate. 

The Hall Sensor Signal is a measurement of the voltage drop between the two sides of the 
plate or element. When the magnetic field increases (disc or solid toothed area in front of 
sensor) the voltage drop across the two sides of the element increases. High voltage on one 
side, low voltage on the other. The signal output from the sensor is High. 

As the disc moves away from the sensor the magnetic fields weakens and is lost. The loss 
of the magnetic field (blank toothed or open area of the wheel in front of the sensor) pro¬ 
duces very little voltage drop across the two sides of the element. The output signal is Low. 

A rapid switching of the voltage ON/OFF produces a HIGH/LOW signal that the control 
module uses to recognize speed and position. 


Typical Application of Hall Effect sensors 

• Crankshaft Sensors 

• Camshaft Sensors 

• Motor Position and Speed Sensors (e.g. Window Motor, Sunroof Motor) 


32 

Electronic Signals and Components 

























Magnetoresistive Sensors 

The active sensing of the Magnetoresistive Sensor is particularly suitable for advanced 
stability control applications in which sensing at zero or near zero speed is required. 

A permanent magnet in the sensor produces a magnetic field with the magnetic field 
stream at a right angle to the sensing element. 

The sensor element is a ferromagnetic alloy that changes its resistance based on the 
influence of magnetic fields. 

As the high portion of the pulse wheel approaches the sensing element a deflection of 
the magnetic field stream is created. This creates a resistance change in the thin film 
ferromagnetic layer of the sensor element.

The sensor element is affected by the direction of the magnetic field, not the field 
strength. The field strength is not important as long as it is above a certain level. This 
allows the sensor to tolerate variations in the field strength caused by age, temperature, 
or mechanical tolerances. 

The resistance change in the sensor element affects the voltage that is supplied by the 
evaluation circuit. The small amount of voltage provided to the sensor element is moni¬ 
tored and the voltage changes (1 to lOOmv) are converted into current pulses by the 
evaluation module.

• Signal High-14mA 



The sensor is supplied 12V by the control unit. Output voltage from the sensor is approx¬ 
imately 10V. The control unit counts the high and low current pulses to determine the 
wheel speed. 


Typical Application of Magnetoresistive Sensor 

• Currently used for wheel speed sensors.

Electronic Signals and Components 
























































Designated Value Signals 

Designated values are produced through fixed 
resistance positions of a multi-position switch. 
As the switch is operated the voltage drop 
across the resistor(s) of each switch position 
causes the voltage level of the input signal to 
change to a predetermined voltage value. 

These predetermined (designated) voltages 
signal the control module to perform specific 
functions.
