After completion of this module you will be able to: 

• Demonstrate accurate and efficient use of Wiring Diagrams. 

• Understand general conventions that dictate the format of how wiring 
schematics are drawn. 


• Locate correct schematics using a variety of different methods. 

• Correctly interpret symbols and identifying common devices that are 
often used in the wiring schematics. 

• Identify the location of critical components used in the schematics. 


• Demonstrate a knowledgeable understanding of associated documentation 
often used in conjunction with the wiring schematics.

Introduction 


Schematics 

The schematics divide the vehicle electrical system into individual circuits. Components 
which interact with that circuit are shown on the same schematic. 

In order to provide a standard for the way in which a Wiring Diagram (SSP) is written and 
read, there are general rules that apply. Components are drawn in such a way that their 
general layout and function are self-explanatory. They are arranged on the page so that 
the current path can be followed from positive (top) to negative (bottom). 

General Guidelines 

Wiring Diagram “SSP-SP0000020123 LH Rear Seatback Adjustment” will be 
used as an example. 

1. Switches and relays are always shown in their rest position, (e.g. K135) 

2. A component drawn in a dotted line indicates that only part of the component is 
shown, (e.g. A3) 

3. A component drawn as a solid line indicates that all of that component is shown. 

(SI 0494) 

4. The dotted line between pins 4, 2 of connector XI0663, pins 5, 6 and 4, 3, 1 of 
connector XI0494, pins 5, 6, 1 and 4, 3 of connector XI0496, pins 1,2 of connec¬ 
tor XI 0498, indicate that all the pins belong to that connector. 

5. Terminal operation is usually noted within a component box. (e.g. 15, 30, etc.) 

6. Component designation is shown to the right of the box. (e.g. A3, K135, etc.) 

7. Component name is shown under Component designation, (e.g. Light module; 
Relay, rear compartment backrest) 

8. Splice points are shown between components, noted by a connector number, (e.g. 
XI0664, XI019, etc.) 

9. Signal name, wire cross section and color are noted as a list to the right of the wire 
between components, (e.g. 58G, 0.5, GR/RT). Of note, the wire cross section is 
given in sguare millimeters (mm 2 ). 

To obtain more information on a component or signal select any blue hotbox on the 
wiring diagram (additional information should appear to the left of the SSF) such as EBO, 
STA, PIB, etc.). It is also helpful to press the Installation button, on the lower left of the 
navigation bar on ISTA, after selecting a component’s blue hotbox. This will show you all 
relevant SSP regarding the component you just selected.
