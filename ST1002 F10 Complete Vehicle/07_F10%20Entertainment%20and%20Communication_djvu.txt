2.1. Car Information Computer 



F10 Car Information Computer 

The CIC head unit was installed for the first time on BMW 1 Series and 3 Series vehicles with the 
navigation system (option 609). This further development of the Car Communication Computer CCC 
is now also being used in the F10. 

By storing data on a 80 gigabyte hard disk, the new head unit provides many new functions and 
options. 

The audio systems with CIC added a music collection function. Music files can be converted (ripped) 
or copied for the music collection on the hard disc. Fast access to these music files, stored on the 
ClC-dedicated hard disc, is ensured at all times. A selection of up to 3700 music files (12 gigabytes) is 
possible. 

The tuners/decoders of the digital radio systems, (IBOC) digital tuner and satellite tuner (SDARS) are 
now integrated into the CIC. 

A modified base plate adapter extends the connectivity of the music player (option 6NF). This makes it 
possible to connect to and play back music tracks in the mobile phone. 

Simple menu navigation and playback of these music tracks can now be controlled via the iDrive. 

For additional information about the Car Information Computer, refer to the "Car Information Computer 
CIC" and “F01/F02 Audio System” training material available on TIS and ICR

3. Speaker Systems 

3.1. Overview 



F10 Speakers 


The speaker systems in the FI 0 are offered in two levels: 

• HiFi system = HiFi loudspeaker system (standard equipment) 

• Top HiFi system = HiFi system Professional (option 677). 

The HiFi system standard equipment on all F10 models. 

The HiFi system is equipped with an eight-channel amplifier with digital equalizer. However, only seven 
of the eight channels are used in the HiFi system. 

The bass speakers are located under the front seats. They are coupled to the side sills to increases the 
resonance volume necessary for bass reproduction. 

The head-units CIC and Champ 2 can be combined with any of the amplifier/speaker systems 
available. 

The HiFi system and Top-HiFi systems feature separate speakers for the treble and mid-range 
frequencies. 

Even though the diameters of the speakers in the HiFi and Top HiFi System Professional are the same, 
there are differences in the performance of the speakers. This is achieved by the use of different 
materials for the diaphragms, coils and magnets. 

The Top HiFi system supports playback of multichannel formats. Multichannel audio formats can be 
played back with the player in the CIC or with the 6x DVD changer. 

The HiFi system has twelve speakers while the Top-HiFi system has 16 speakers each with different 
auxiliary amplifiers. 


3.2. Components 


3.2.1. HiFi system 

The following graphic shows the speakers and the amplifier of the HiFi system. The speakers are 
powered with 5 x 25 watts for the midrange speakers and tweeters and 2 x 40 watts for the bass 
speakers.

3.2.2. Top HiFi system 

The following graphic shows the speakers and the amplifier of the HiFi System. The speakers are 
powered with 7 x 50 watts for the midrange speakers and tweeters and 2 x 125 watts for the bass 
speakers. 

In the FI 0, the amplifier in the HiFi System is equipped with what is known as a load-logic separation. 
Here, the electronics of the amplifier are supplied and connected via a separate voltage line. The line 
is specially protected against short-term voltage dips and thus prevents failure of the electronics in the 
event of a short-term voltage dip.

Sound output takes place either through the vehicle's speakers or via headphones. The volume of the 
speakers can be adjusted via the multifunction steering wheel, the head unit or with the radio remote 
control. The volume is controlled speed-dependent during playback through the speakers. The driving 
speed is registered by the wheel speed sensors. 

The tone settings can be adjusted on the Car Information Computer or Car Information Computer 
Basic or using the radio remote control. 

If the sound is output via the headphones, the volume can be adjusted either on the headphones 
(infrared headphones) or using the radio remote control (hard-wired headphones). The infrared 
headphones receive their signals from the infrared transmitter. 

External devices can be connected via the two AV inputs directly to the RSE control unit or via the 
AUX-ln connection or the USB audio interface (option 6FL) in the center console. The USB audio 
interface provides an additional jack and a USB connection for a type A USB connector. 

Video cannot be transmitted to the rear seat entertainment system when a DVD is played back via 
the Car Information Computer. Similarly, video is not transmitted to the Car Information Computer 
when a DVD is played back in the rear seat entertainment control unit. Sound output, however, is 
possible in both cases. Picture and sound are transmitted to the CIC and the rear seat entertainment 
system during playback via the DVD changer. For safety reasons, no picture is shown in the Central 
Information Display while the vehicle is being driven. Sound output continues even when the car is not 
at a standstill. 

An external device (e.g. game console) can be additionally connected via the AV inputs. The 
corresponding video signal is output on the display of the connected source. The selected DVD can 
still be viewed on the other display. Prerequisite: see Functions, Connection to external equipment via 
AV input. 

The RSE MID control unit has a FBAS/CVBS (composite video baseband signal) input for the screen of 
the DVD changer or video module. 

The video switch is installed corresponding to the equipment configuration.

The remote control features two LED for checking operation and battery voltage. Transmission of a 
wireless signal is acknowledged by the green send signal lighting. The radio remote control signals are 
only sent if the rear seat entertainment system is switched on. 

If the battery voltage reaches a critical level, the red battery symbol will light instead of the green send 
symbol each time a button is pressed. The battery in the radio remote control must be replaced to 
ensure continued operation. 

The thumbwheel, the confirmation button and the four-way directional controller make up the iDrive 
controller functions. Turning the thumbwheel corresponds to turning the iDrive controller. Sliding the 
iDrive controller to the left, right, forwards or back is replaced by pressing the corresponding button 
on the four-way directional controller. Pressing the iDrive controller corresponds to pressing the 
confirmation button. 

The entire radio remote control changes over to the selected side by operating the selector slide. 

The signals of the radio remote control are received by the antenna for radio remote control services in 
the rear window.
