Information status and national-market versions 

The BMW Group produces vehicles to meet the very highest standards of safety and quality. Changes 
in terms of environmental protection, customer benefits and design make it necessary to develop 
systems and components on a continuous basis. Consequently, this may result in differences between 
the content of this document and the vehicles available in the training course. 

As a general principle, this document describes left-hand drive vehicles in the European version. Some 
controls or components are arranged differently in right-hand drive vehicles than those shown on the 
graphics in this document. Further discrepancies may arise from market-specific or country-specific 
equipment specifications.

F10 Displays, Indicators and Controls 

1. System Overview 

1.1. Introduction 

As in all other BMW models, the operating and control concept of the new BMW 5 Series F10 is based 
on clear and optimum structuring of the cockpit. A reduced number of switches simplifies the logical 
operation. The display, indicator and control elements are organized in a hierarchical arrangement 
corresponding to their function.

2. System Components 

2.1. Instrument cluster 

The instrument panel receives information on the wiring harness in the form of analog and digital 
electrical signals. These signals are processed and displayed in the instrument panel or passed on as 
information to other control units. 

As a control unit, the instrument panel is a bus device in the MOST bus and in the powertrain CAN. 

2.1.1. Basic instrument panel 

The basic instrument panel already familiar from the F07 is used in all versions of the FI 0. A TFT 
display with a resolution of 640 x 160 pixels is located in the basic instrument panel under the round 
instruments. It has a screen diagonal of 5.7". The round instruments are always surrounded by a 
closed ring.

2.1.2. Brake energy display 

The FI 0 comes standard with Brake Energy Regeneration. Brake Energy Regeneration transforms 
the vehicle’s kinetic energy into electricity, and uses this power to charge the battery. As a result, the 
battery draws less power from the engine, and fuel consumption is reduced. 

The kinetic energy of the vehicle is converted into electrical energy while the vehicle is in coasting 
mode or under braking. The battery is partially charged and the fuel consumption can be reduced. 

The blue indicator in the instrument panel below the tachometer, which lights up whenever kinetic 
energy is converted into electricity (while coasting off the accelerator or under braking). The red 
section of the display below the “P” is the mile per gallon gauge.

2.1.3. On-board computer 

The on-board computer functions can be called up by briefly pressing the on-board computer button 
on the steering column switch. 

Pressing the on-board computer button again displays information in the following order: 

♦ Range 

♦ Average fuel consumption 

♦ Average speed 

♦ Distance (with activated route guidance) 

♦ Estimated time of arrival (with activated route guidance) 

♦ Date 

♦ Road sign recognition.

2.2. Central Information Display 

Depending on the equipment, two different versions of the Central Information Display CID are 
installed in the F10. 

As on all new BMW models, the system is operated by means of the central control element, the 
controller. 

The central information display is an integrated display and operating unit for the following functions: 

♦ Audio functions, for example radio, CD, MP3 

♦ Telephone and data services 

♦ On-board computer, journey computer 

♦ Vehicle info, integrated operating instructions IBA 

♦ Heating and air conditioning system 

♦ Personalized features, for example radio station selection 

♦ Vehicle functions, for example PDC and EDC 

♦ BMW Services. 

2.2.1. CID with 10.2" screen diagonal 

In conjunction with the Navigation system (option 609), a CID with 10.2" screen diagonal is installed. 
The resolution of the display is 1280 x 480 pixels.

2.2.2. CID with 7" screen diagonal 

In conjunction with a vehicle configuration without a navigation system, a CID with 7" screen diagonal 
is installed. The resolution of this display is 800 x 480 pixels.

2.3. Head-Up Display 

The very name "Head-Up" describes the principle benefit of this system. The Head-Up Display HUD 
projects a virtual image into the driver's field of vision. Important information such as cruise control 
details or arrow displays from the navigation system are projected onto the windscreen and are thus 
permanently visible within the driver's field of view. 

The head-up display (option 610) in the FI 0 contains various functions aimed at enhancing road 
safety and driving comfort. 

The head-up display includes the following: 

♦ the Dynamic Cruise Control DCC 

♦ the Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function 

♦ the collision warning with brake application function 

♦ information from the navigation system 

♦ Check Control messages 

♦ road speed. 

Having the displays in the driver's direct field of view increases safety, as the eyes are always on the 
traffic.

material available on TIS and ICR 


2.4. Night Vision 2 

The BMW Night Vision 2 system provides the driver with a black-and-white image of the driving 
environment ahead of the vehicle in the Central Information Display CID. 

BMW Night Vision 2 is a 100 % passive system without active infrared illumination. Objects situated 
ahead of the vehicle are shown in varying degrees of brightness depending on their temperature. This 
enables the driver to detect in good time heat-emitting objects, such as people, animals and other 
vehicles. 

This information is recorded with a far infrared camera via a special imaging sensor which detects the 
infrared radiation in a specific wavelength range. 

Intelligent algorithms in the control unit makes it possible to automatically detect persons in the image. 
Following evaluation of distance and direction of movement, a symbol on the central information 
display and in the head-up display warns the driver of any persons at risk.

2. System Components 

Night Vision 2 is available for the F10 as the optional equipment BMW Night Vision with pedestrian 
detection (option 6UK). 

As in the F01/F02, the video camera for BMW Night Vision is installed in the F10 behind the radiator 
grill, on the top left corner. 

For more information on Night Vision 2, refer to the F01 "BMW Night Vision 2" training material 
available on TIS and ICR 


2.5. Controls on the steering wheel 

There is a switch block in the steering wheel on the left and right. 

The operating elements for cruise control with braking function (Dynamic Cruise Control DCC) and the 
Active Cruise Control ACC are located on the left side of the steering wheel. 

The controls for operation of the radio and telephone functions are on the right.
