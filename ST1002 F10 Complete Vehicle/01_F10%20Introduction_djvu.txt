F10 Introduction 

2. Body 

2.1. Bodyshell 



F10 Bodyshell (body in white) 


2.1.1. Introduction 

As with other models, the use of lightweight materials was a major requirement in the FI 0 design. This 
involves the intelligent deployment of increased-strength multiphase steels and super high strength 
(press hardened) steels. In the FI 0, the average strength of the body materials has increased by 55% 
compared to the E60. 

The lightweight materials contribute significantly to the overall reduction in vehicle weight, and in 
combination with the rigidity of the body structure. 

The lightweight materials used on the FI 0 body structure contribute directly to its: 

• Driving Dynamics 

• Reduction of fuel consumption 

• Reduction of CO 2 emissions 

• Passive safety 


4 


TK09-1997 



F10 Introduction 

2. Body 

Weight saving features of the F10 bodyshell 

• Strut towers are made of die-cast aluminum 

• High proportion of multiphase steels (20 % of the body skeleton weight) 

• High proportion of hot-formed steels (14 % of the body skeleton weight) 

The die-cast aluminum strut towers reinforce the front section by ensuring the necessary rigidity 
that the component design requires to withstand the loads. Compared to a conventional steel-shell 
structure, the more compact design has significantly reduced the installation space and the weight in 
the front section. This provides a more uniform axle-load distribution, among other benefits. 

The increased-strength multiphase steels and super high strength hot-formed steels combine low 
weight with maximum strength for the safety passenger cell, thus contributing significantly to passive 
safety. 

For hot-formed steels, an innovative further development known as passive corrosion protection is 
used. Previously, no suitable hot-formed sheet metal materials with cathodic corrosion protection had 
been available on the market. With the development of press-hardening, a method is now available 
that enables mass production of galvanized hot-formed components. The components fabricated 
in this way can be used in the wet area without corrosion of the base material. There is no need for 
additional corrosion protection measures for this steel. 

2.1.2. Materials 

A modern vehicle body has to fulfill many different requirements. Despite small exterior dimensions, 
it is to provide the largest possible passenger compartment. In the event of an accident, it must 
provide the passengers with the best possible protection. All assemblies, such as the engine and 
transmission, are supported by the body against the torque they generate. Futhermore, the body 
must have high static and, above all, dynamic rigidity to guarantee the excellent driving characteristics 
typical of BMW vehicles. 

In addition, the supporting structure of the vehicle must have high fatigue strength and be able to be 
repaired with reasonable effort and cost in the event of an accident. 

To fulfill all these requirements, BMW applies a manufacturing strategy that produces each part from 
the material that is best suited for its function. 

The two terms "aluminum" and "steel" are only the generic terms for the wide variety of alloys used in 
the construction of the body. 

These different alloys have quite different properties.

Multiphase steels are steels with a structure that consists of multiple phases. Advanced-strength 
multiphase steels with a yield strength R p0 .2 of 300 to 600 MPa include, for example, dual-phase 
steels and TRIP steels. Advanced-strength multiphase steels with a yield strength R p0 .2 over 600 MPa 
include, for example, complex-phase steels and martensite-phase steels. 

The hot-formed manganese-boron steels are ultra-high-strength steels with a yield strength R p q .2 of 
over 900 MPa. 

Weight proportions 

The proportion of advanced-strength multiphase steels, super high strength hot-formed steels 
and aluminum is increasing. These measures decrease the vehicle weight while still guaranteeing 
maximum strength of the bodyshell.

2.1.3. Corrosion protection and tightness 

In order to optimize anti-corrosion protection, the body of the FI 0 is constructed primarily from 
galvanized sheet metal and aluminum or aluminum sandwich sheet metals. Welding, adhesive bonding 
and riveting are the assembly techniques used. 

The overlaps of the panels are designed to minimize the joint surfaces, to prevent bondline corrosion. 
The penetration of water into the body structure is prevented in the design engineering of the vehicle 
by adhering and sealing the joint surfaces. 


In particularly critical areas, expanding foam parts are used to seal the body cavities against moisture. 
Doubled up sheets in wet zones are double-sealed and, if necessary, they are also treated with wax to 
ensure a water tight seal. 


7 











F10 Introduction 

2. Body 

If necessary, the overlaps of the panels in dry zones are sealed to prevent dust from getting inside. 

Corrosion-critical material pairing is avoided. The combinations of material substrates and joining 
methods were chosen with meticulous care in order to avoid corrosion risks. 

Coating process 

In the painting process, the bodyshell is dipped and: 

• Alkaline-cleaned 

• Phosphated (roughening the surface for better adhesion) 

• Cathodic-dip coated (anticorrosion coating that coats the insides of all body cavities). 

The organic paint coat is then baked on. 

Furthermore, the body is sealed with PVC and protected by filler, topcoat and clear coat paints on the 
outer skin. 

Critical parts of the body of the FI 0 are specially treated with cavity preservation sealant. 

The objectives are: 

• Three years without any visible corrosion whatsoever 

• Twelve years without rust penetration 

• High level of protection against water and dust intrusion. 

2.1.4. Front section 

Regarding the repair of the FI 0 front section, compared to the F01, there are no major changes. 

As on previous vehicles, body struts are used to increase the rigidity of the front section.

2.2. Pedestrian Protection 

The front section of the bodyshell of the F10 incorporates several pedestrian-protection measures. An 
impact absorber is installed between the bumper support and the bumper trim to provide protection 
for leg impact. The hood and the front fenders are made of aluminum and incorporate deformation 
elements. These design measures are adopted to produce a defined dissipation of energy in the event 
of an accident. 


2.3. Doors 

As with the F01, the doors of the FI 0 are made of aluminum reinforced with sheet-metal intrusion 
beams. 




F10 intrusion beams on the doors 


Large stamped sheet metal intrusion beams within the doors transfer force to the body and ensure 
high rigidity and component quality. The implementation of very deep stamping in the fabrication of 
the inner door panel structure and the clever use of a hinge reinforcement have enable a sophisticated 
design/contour of the exterior.

F10 Introduction 

2. Body 

The window frame area fulfills the highest requirements for rigidity. It is a single section made of only 
two sheet-metal parts with minimum dimensions. Even in the visually sensitive window frame area, the 
intensive BMW exterior design queues where able to be implemented. 

Advantages of this design are: 

• Reduced C0 2 emissions and increased driving dynamics due to decreased weight 
(23 kg per vehicle lighter than a comparable steel version) 

• Interior impression of an improved spaciousness. 

• Allows more light into the passenger compartment 

• Improved visibility 

• Window frames look lighter and slimmer when the doors are closed 

• When the doors are open, the window frames look solid with a high-quality appeal 

• Maximum form stability of the separate components provided by one-piece inner door panels 

• Lowest possible number of components for the door structure 

• Laser welding and structural adhesive bonding as the joining technologies of the door 
structure. 

BMW has already made frequent use of aluminum door structures in the past, e. g. for the E52, E63, 
E64. However, only since the F01 have aluminum doors been produced for vehicles in large quantities. 

The development objective for the FI 0 door structure, therefore, was to implement the familiar 
concept for an aluminum door from the F01 as a door that can be manufactured even in larger 
quantities at acceptable costs. 

However, aluminum is not as easy to shape as steel, so aluminum stamping parts are much more 
difficult to manufacture than their steel counterparts, particularly when the stamping depths are 
considerable. 

With the development of a new structure concept (with large braces to transmit force), manufacturing 
feasibility was ensured without having to forego the proven metal plate component construction 
methods. 


2.4. Trunk lid 

Regarding the repair of the FI 0 trunk lid, there are no major changes, compared to the F01. 

Features of the trunk lid: 

• Self-opening trunk lid 

• Tension springs are located in horizontal position below the water gutter as for the F01 

• Spindle drives are used instead of the tension springs for vehicles with automatic trunk lid 
(“Power tailgate” option 316) 

• Trunk lid trim and toolkit as for F01

• Rear lights in the trunk lid, bulb are replaced as on F01 

• New trunk lid push-button 

• Rear view camera (option 3AG) integrated in the housing of the trunk lid push-button.

2.5. Sliding/tilting sunroof 

An electrical glass sunroof is standard equipment on all FI 0 models. 

It is designed as a slide/tilt sunroof system that is operated from the interior.

F10 Introduction 

2. Body 


As with the F01, the front edge of the glass panel runs parallel to the windshield/roof edge (contour 
roof) and thus makes the appearance of the complete vehicle more harmonious. The larger glass area 
gives the passenger compartment a bright, spacious feeling. Thus the sensation of space is improved. 

The glass panel and the sliding trim are all-electric and are operated using a switch in the roof function 
center (FZD). 

The usual control and operation logic for the slide/tilt sunroof is maintained: 

• To open the roof- 

Push the switch to the rear 

• To close the roof- 

Push the switch forward 

• Set roof to vent position- 

Push the switch up. 

The operation and control logic for opening the sliding trim is similar to that of the panorama-roof 
configurations. The operating logic corresponds to the direction of movement of the components and 
thus can be understood easily by the customer. 

The sliding trim is integrated in the interior design of the headlining, providing a high-class interior 
effect. 

To eliminate the risk of possible injuries, an anti-trap mechanism for the glass panel and for the 
gear mechanism cover is implemented over the entire travel path complying with the local legal 
requirements.

3.1.2. Rear bumper 

The rear bumper carrier (with the impact absorber) is bolted to the bodyshell structure. It can absorb 
low-speed impacts (at least 4 km/h/2.5 mph) without damage to the bodywork. 

The bumper system is a consumer-protection-compliant (low-speed impact) design that prevents 
damage to the vehicle's body structure. The consumer protection requirements are set forth in Europe 
by the German "Allianz" center for technology (AZT) and in the USA by the Insurance Institute for 
Highway Safety (IIHS). Deformation elements are specifically designed to lower repair costs. 

3.1.3. Underbody design 

The smooth vehicle underbody prevents air turbulence beneath the vehicle, this produces less drag 
and better road grip. 

A 

Modifying the vehicle underbody or removing the underbody panels will result in changes of the air 
flow which can have a negative effect on the road grip.

The interior color is continued in the bottom dashboard. This area below the decorative strip is 
available in the following colors: 

• Black 

• Everest grey 

• Veneto beige 

• Oyster 

• Cinnamon brown 


Highlights 

• The cockpit is inclined towards the driver at an angle of approximately 7 degrees, this gives a 
clear orientation to the driver. 

• Enhancement of decorative strips and fresh air grill by means of accentuating strips 

• Fold-out DVD changer for 6 DVDs (option 696) in the glove box 

• Folding compartment on the driver's side

The attractive decorative strips lift as they terminate where they meet the doors. The decorative strips 
are available in high-gloss black or, as optional equipment, in finely polished aluminum or various types 
of wood. 

In addition, the appearance of the fresh-air grille is enhanced by a chrome inlay on the adjusting lever 
for changing the air flow direction. For better operation at night, the F10 has added lighting to the 
thumbwheel on the center fresh-air grille. With the optional equipment 4-zone climate control (option 
4NB), the thumbwheels on the outer fresh-air grille are also illuminated. 

With the optional equipment 2-zone (option 534) or 4-zone climate control (option 4NB), the outer 
louvres and corresponding center bars on the center fresh-air grille have a galvanized finish.

For vehicles with the optional equipment 4-zone climate control, various ventilation levels can be 
selected using the thumbwheels on the center fresh-air grille. 

• Draft-free ventilation: 

Air flow is fanned out for a lower intensity 

• Maximum amount of air: 

Air is partially fanned out and bundled. This enables maximum air supply. 

• Direct ventilation: 

Air is bundled and can be specifically directed at one point.

Side airbag

Explanation

Airbag module in the backrest 


The front side airbag is integrated into the backrest of the driver's and front passenger's seat. The seat 
back extends into the side of the seat, this is called the "encompassing seat wall". When the airbag 
is triggered, the side is pushed slightly open, this allows the airbag to open and provide its protective 
function. The front seats are equipped with seat-occupancy recognition and a belt tensioner. 

Crash-active headrest 

The front seats are equipped with a crash-active headrest. In the fully electrical seats, the head 
restraint has a button for adjusting the distance to your head. 

In the comfort seat, the distance is adjustable using the upper backrest adjustment.

• Center armrest (folding) with storage compartment and cup holder 

• Center head restraint, folding 

• Backrests, folding 40 %, 60 % or 100 % (only with through-loading system, option 465) 

In the FI 0, a completely newly developed backrest is installed in the basic seat bench. Unlike the 
predecessor model, this does not consist of a metal structure, but instead of a composite material.

The front moulded plastic part consists of polypropylene with 30 % glass fiber (PP-GF30, impact 
resistant). The moulded plastic part is foamed on the rear using expanded polypropylene (EPP), a 
polypropylene-based particle foam. 


The sandwich structure is highly stable, with a lower weight than a conventionally manufactured 
backrest structure.

Center armrest/head restraint 

Another new feature in the FI 0 is the free-standing center armrest with separate folding head restraint 
in both seat bench versions. 



F10 Rear seats 

Unlike the E60, the center head restraint has been separated from the center armrest and designed 
as a folding head restraint. When folded, the view towards the rear is improved without the need to 
actuate the center armrest. This also contributes to active safety. 

Because the head restraint is in a far forward position when folded up, it provides the center rear seat 
passenger a high degree of safety despite a relatively low weight. 

Through-loading system 

The Split fold-down-rear seat system (option 465) with through-loading makes the FI 0 the perfect 
companion to both everyday life and leisure. Thanks to the divided rear seat backrest, even bulky 
goods can be transported without a problem, and there is still room for occupants in the rear 
passenger compartment. 


The rear seat backrest can be divided and folded in a 60:40 ratio. The rear seat backrest elements are 
unlocked from the luggage compartment. 


33 














F10 Introduction 

3. Exterior and Interior Equipment 


Together with the through-loading system, a ski bag (option 464) can also be installed. This allows up 
to four pairs of skis or two snowboards to be transported neatly and securely. When the ski bag is not 
in use, it is stowed compactly behind the center armrest. 

Seat heating 

Seat heating (option 496) can be ordered as parts as ZCW Cold Weather Package option.

3.3. Luggage compartment 

The luggage compartment capacity is 520 liters. The luggage compartment has sufficient space for 
items such as four golf bags (46"), a stroller or four pairs of skis (with optional equipment ski bag, 
option 464). The optional seat bench with through-loading system (option 465) allows the luggage 
compartment capacity to be expanded even further.
