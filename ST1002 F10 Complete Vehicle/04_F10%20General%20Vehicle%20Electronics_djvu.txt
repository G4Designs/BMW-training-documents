2. Voltage Supply 

The Voltage supply concept of the FI 0 is based on that of the F01. The components and the structure 
used are largely the same. 


2.1. Components 

Due to the steady increase of electrical functions for comfort, communication and safety in BMW 
vehicles, the voltage supply is becoming ever more important. 

In the FI 0, two separate power distribution boxes with fuse blocks are installed. The front power 
distribution box with fuse block is near the glove box and the rear power distribution box with fuse 
block is on the right-hand side of the luggage compartment. 

The front power distribution box with fuse block forms the junction box together with the junction box 
electronics (JBE). 

In the graphic below, you can see the layout of the most important components of the voltage supply 
system in the F10. 

In the FI 0, three main power lines (bolted to on the underbody of the vehicle) are run from the power 
distribution box on the battery to the engine compartment: 

• One of the main power lines runs via the positive battery terminal to the starter motor and to 
the alternator. 

• The second line supplies the electronics box in the engine compartment with voltage for the 
engine electronics. This line is protected by a high-current fuse in the distribution box at the 
battery. 

• The third line leads to the engine compartment power distribution box. This distribution box 
supplies the electric fan with power. This line is protected by the high-current fuse in the 
distribution box at the battery. 

In addition, a battery cable is routed through the vehicle interior to the front power distribution box with 
fuse block. This line is also protected by a high-current circuit breaker. 

Depending on the model, different line cross sections are used. 

The transfer points for the main power cables are located under the luggage compartment floor. The 
main power lines on the underbody are laid in a protected area to prevent damage. 

The electromechanical power steering is supplied with voltage differently, depending on equipment 
and engine. 

For more information on the voltage supply, refer to the F01/F02 "Voltage Supply" training material 
available on TIS and ICR

2.3. EPS Voltage Supply 

The electromechanical power steering is supplied with voltage differently, depending on equipment 
and engine. 

In the FI 0, electromechanical power steering is combined for the first time with the active steering 
planetary gearbox with override function already familiar from the F01. As a result, the steering is 
implemented completely electrically.

2.3.2. EPS in conjunction with active steering 

Due to the higher weight of the some engines and the higher steering forces associated with the 
greater front axle load, the power of a 12V steering system is no longer sufficient. For this reason, on 
FI 0 vehicles with the V8 engine a 24V EPS system will be installed in conjunction with the optional 
Integral Active Steering equipment. 

The following table tells you when a 24V EPS is installed.

Since active steering demands higher forces from the electromechanical steering and due to the 
higher current necessary, the voltage supply can no longer be implemented as in previous systems. If 
active steering is used in a vehicle with 12V EPS, the voltage is supplied through a separate positive 
battery connection point.

EPS with 24V 


The higher weight of the V8 engines in the BMW 550i results in a higher front axle load. This in turn 
causes the power required for the steering system to increase. In conjunction with the active steering, 
an even higher exertion of force, and therefore an even higher current is required by the steering 
electrical components. This high current made it necessary to increase the voltage supply of the EPS 
to 24V. 

This system requires an auxiliary battery, a separator and a charging unit for the auxiliary battery. 

These components are installed in the luggage compartment of the FI 0.

Battery Charge Unit (BCU) (for auxiliary battery) 


The battery charging unit (BCU) takes over the monitoring of the state of charge and the charging 
of the auxiliary battery with an 150W DC/DC converter. It monitors a cable sheathing of the 24V line 
(isolation) and among various other preconditions; it also switches the relay in the separator with which 
the auxiliary battery is integrated into the circuit. The EPS is supplied with 24V only after this relay has 
been switched (closed). In the event of a fault, the EPS can also be operated with 12V. If there is no 
fault, the relay in the separator is switched (to close the circuit) as of terminal 15.

3. Car Access System 

The Car Access System used in the FI 0 is the fourth generation of the control unit and the same type 
as in the F01. The Comfort Access functions are completely integrated into the Car Access System. 

All FI 0 models are equipped with “Passive Go” (drive authorization system) as standard equipment. 
Drive authorization allows the driver to start the engine without actively using the ID transmitter. Due 
to the drive authorization (Passive Go), the vehicle does not require any key insertion slot. The ID 
transmitter only needs to be somewhere inside the passenger compartment for the engine to be 
started. 

The ID transmitter has a battery with a service life of approximately four years. 

Up to eight ID transmitters can be used for a particular vehicle.

3.2. Function overview 

The Car Access System provides, among other things, the central control unit for accessing and 
locking the vehicle. Therefore, the Car Access System has full responsibility for central locking. 

The Car Access System incorporates the following functions on the FI 0: 

• Comfort Access 

• Central locking system 

• Power window regulator 

• Glass sunroof 

• Terminal control 

• Electronic immobilizer 

Other functions of the Car Access System include: 

• Vehicle data storage 

• Data transmission for Conditioned Based Service (CBS) 

• Checking plausibility of ID transmitter signals 

The Car Access System enables or disables the execution of a number of functions. However, other 
control units may be involved in the execution of the function: 

• Junction box electronics 

• Footwell module 

• Roof function center 

• Central locking system 

• Power window regulator 

• Glass sunroof 

For the purposes of communication with other bus users in the vehicle electrical system, the Car 
Access System is connected via the K-CAN2, the CAS bus and the LIN-Bus. 

The Car Access System analyzes the status of the trunk lid contact switch and broadcasts it for use by 
the alarm system. 

The Car Access System also analyzes the status of the following buttons and initiates the central 
locking function:

• Central locking system button 

• Open large trunk button on the A-pillar 

• Complete locking of the vehicle with the button in the underside of the open luggage 
compartment lid. 

The Car Access System provides the power supply for the brake light switch and also analyzes its 
status. 

For a more detailed description of the Car Access System functions, refer to the F01/F02 "Car Access 
System" training material available on TIS and ICR

4. Comfort Access 


Using Comfort Access, the customer can unlock and open the vehicle without active use of the ID 
transmitter. Access to the vehicle can be gained from any point. It is important that the ID transmitter 
be located in the vehicle's immediate vicinity (approx. 1.5 m). It is sufficient to have the ID transmitter 
somewhere on your person. 

Comfort Access was first introduced on the E65 (03/2002). The system was then gradually introduced 
on different BMW models. Comfort Access can be ordered as optional equipment (option 322) as 
part of ZCV Convenience Package (which also includes 316 Power tailgate 323 Soft-close automatic 
doors. 

The benefits of Comfort Access are: 

• High level of convenience when unlocking and locking the vehicle 

• Convenient and fast access to the vehicle 

• Simple engine start/stop procedure 

• Maximum comfort for the driver. 

Comfort Access in the FI 0 is based on predecessor systems and is adapted to the FI 0. However, the 
complete function continues to be in the Car Access System, just as in the F01. That is why the FI 0 
also has no separate Comfort Access control unit. 

The vehicle is unlocked when your hand touches the handle recess of the outer door handle and is 
opened when you pull the door handle. 

The vehicle can be locked simply by touching sensitive surfaces of the outer door handle. 

For vehicles fitted with the Automatic Soft Close system (option 323), the drive for the Automatic 
Soft Close system fully closes the vehicle door. You can then lock the vehicle again by subsequently 
pressing on the sensitive surface of the outer door handle. 

The ID transmitter must be located in the vehicle interior in order for the engine to be started. The 
engine can now be started by pressing the START-STOP button when the brake pedal is operated and 
the vehicle is ready to be driven.

5.2. Function overview 

The function of the central locking system is basically divided between two control units. 

The Car Access System has overall control. The Car Access System is aware of the statuses of the 
central locking system. Therefore it is the Car Access System which causes the unlocking, locking and 
central deadlocking of the vehicle. 

The junction box electronics execute the request to unlock or lock the vehicle. 

It is possible to unlock and lock the vehicle actively or passively. 

Active means that the vehicle can be opened after it has been unlocked by pressing the button on 
the ID transmitter. The vehicle can be locked by pressing the Lock button after the doors have been 
closed. 

A_ 

Note: The vehicle can only be locked with the driver's door closed. 


30

5. Central Locking System 

Passive locking and unlocking requires the optional Comfort Access equipment (option 322). 

Passive means that the vehicle is unlocked when the outer door handle is grasped, provided the ID 
transmitter is located no more than approx. 1.5 metres away from the vehicle. The locking function is 
triggered by pressing on the sensitive area on the outer door handle. 

For a more detailed description of the locking functions, refer to the F01/F02 "Central locking system" 
training material available on TIS and ICR

6. Automatic Soft Close System 

The Automatic Soft Close system (SCA) can be ordered as optional equipment (option 323) on all F10 
models as part of the ZCV Convenience Package. 

The ZCV Convenience Package also includes, Power tailgate (option 316) and Comfort Access 
keyless entry (option 322). 

The luggage compartment lid is equipped with the Automatic Soft Close system only in conjunction 
with the Power tailgate (option 316). 

The Automatic Soft Close system requires the installation of suitable door locks with drives for the 
Automatic Soft Close system. 

The special feature of the FI 0's Automatic Soft Close system is that the door lock and the drive for the 
Automatic Soft Close are no longer combined as a single component. The drive for the Automatic Soft 
Close system is separate and controls the door lock via a Bowden cable, the same as in the F01. 

This means that the lock and the drive can be fitted separately. 

With the Automatic Soft Close system, it is sufficient to press the luggage compartment lid gently into 
the trunk lid lock. As soon as the locking pawl reaches the pre-locking position, the Automatic Soft 
Close system fully closes the luggage compartment lid. The locking pawl is then located in the main 
locking position. 

For more information on the Automatic Soft Close system, refer to the F01/F02 "Automatic Soft Close 
system" training material available on TIS and ICP.

The following signal path examples show the paths the signal takes before the power window motors 
open or close the windows. A requirement is that the Car Access System has issued the enable to 
operate the power windows. 

7.3.1. Driver's door switch cluster 

When the power window switch for the driver's window or front passenger's window is operated, 
the signal is routed via the LIN-Bus to the footwell module. The footwell module activates the 
corresponding power window motor. 

The signal is routed from the driver's door switch cluster via the LIN-Bus to the footwell module when 
the power window switches for the windows in the rear doors are operated. The footwell module 
sends the signal via the K-CAN2 to the junction box electronics. The junction box electronics receive 
the signal and activate the corresponding power window motor.

8. Glass Sunroof 


The glass sunroof is standard equipment on all F10 models. Several control units are involved in 
operating the glass sunroof. 

For example, the roof function center (FZD) is linked with the Car Access System (CAS), which enables 
or disables operation of the glass sunroof. 

The footwell module (FRM) supplies the signal from the door contacts. The Junction Box electronics 
provide the power supply for the motors via terminal 30. 

The roof function center controls and monitors the motors of the glass sunroof. The function is 
identical to that of the slide/tilt sunroof of the F01/F02. 

For more information on the operating principle of the glass sunroof, refer to the F01/F02 "Slide/tilting

9. Anti-theft Alarm System 

The anti-theft alarm system is standard equipment on all F10 models. As on previous models, the 
alarm system must be activated. When activated, the alarm monitors the whole of the vehicle interior. 

The alarm system monitors the engine compartment and the vehicle's rest position. So that nothing 
can be stolen from the luggage compartment, the alarm system monitors opening of the trunk lid. 

The alarm system also signals an attempt to tamper with the vehicle, e.g. cutting the supply line to the 
emergency power siren. 

An Ultrasonic interior movement detector is integrated in the roof function center. 

The ultrasonic signal passes into the inside of vehicle through apertures in the grille of the roof 
function center. The emergency power siren with tilt sensor is located near the rear wheel arch. 

For more information on the operating principle of the alarm system, refer to the F01/F02 "Anti theft 
System" training material available on TIS and ICR

The Hall sensors in the doors (6, 7,11,12) are monitored by the footwell module (13). As soon as 
the status of a Hall sensor changes, the ultrasonic interior movement detector (14) receives that 
information via the K-CAN2. If the anti-theft alarm system is activated, an alarm is triggered. 


The hood contact switch (1) is monitored by the Car Access System (2). If the status changes, an 
alarm is triggered in the same way. 

Opening of the trunk is monitored by the junction box electronics (4). If the status of the trunk lid 
contact switch (10) changes, it triggers an alarm.

10. Automatic Trunk Lid 


The “Power Tailgate” option is offered in the FI 0 as part of the ZCV Convenience Package, which also 
includes Comfort Access keyless entry and Soft-close automatic doors. 

The automatic operation of the trunk lid improves vehicle access by enabling the luggage 
compartment lid to be opened or closed automatically at the press of a button. A spindle-driven 
system is used in the FI 0 for automatic opening or closing of the luggage compartment lid. 

With Comfort Access, it is even possible to open the luggage compartment lid while the vehicle is 
locked. 

Pressing the outer trunk lid button opens the luggage compartment lid automatically. The only 
requirement is that a vehicle-specific ID transmitter must be present in the immediate vicinity of the 
rear end of the vehicle. The trunk lid can also be opened by pressing the button on the ID transmitter. 

An open luggage compartment lid can be closed by pressing the "close trunk lid" button.

The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the rear window antenna. The remote control 
receiver in the antenna diversity module (15) forwards the signal to the Car Access System (4). The 
Car Access System is the master control unit for the central locking function. 

Once the signal has been successfully verified, the Car Access System issues a command to activate 
the central locking in the trunk lid. 

The junction box electronics (5) execute the command to activate the central locking system in the 
trunk lid. The junction box electronics detect the status of the trunk lid contact switch (11) for the 
automatic operation of trunk lid function. The status of the trunk lid contact switch is sent via the K- 
CAN to the automatic operation of trunk (8). The status is one of the triggering criteria for trunk lid 
operation. 

The sensors (13) and (7) in the spindle drives monitor the movement of the trunk lid. If the trunk lid is 
blocked while being closed, the automatic operation of trunk reverses a little if necessary to remove 
the obstacle. 

An obstruction to luggage compartment lid movement during the opening procedure causes the trunk 
lid to stop and it is not reversed.

12.1. Overview 

The interior lighting of the FI 0 is controlled by the footwell module FRM control unit. 

The footwell module is the central control unit for the interior lighting. All interior lighting outputs of 
the footwell module are pulse-modulated. This ensures that the interior light functions at a constant 
brightness level in the event of voltage fluctuations. The pulse width modulation is also used for the 
"soft ON/soft OFF" function. 

The components for the interior light in the front roof area are integrated in the roof function center 
and in the sun visors. The footwell lighting is located underneath the dashboard. The rear reading and 
interior lights are supplied with voltage via the roof function center.

12.2. System wiring diagram 

The system wiring diagram follows the description below and provides an overview of the full extent of 
all possible interior light options. 

The following examples describe some switching operations for the interior light. 

The status of the door contact (Hall sensor) in the lock (38) changes, for example, when the door is 
opened with the vehicle unlocked. The footwell module (1) evaluates the status and sends the request 
to switch on the interior light. 

At the same time, the door entry lighting (32) for the door that is open and the footwell lights (2, 3) are 
switched on by the footwell module. The status of the door contact changes again when the vehicle 
door is closed. The footwell module initiates the procedure to switch off the interior light. 

The luggage compartment lights and the lights in the luggage compartment lid (24, 46) are connected 
to the voltage supply via terminal 30B. If one of the luggage compartment lids is opened, the status 
of the tailgate contact switch changes (27). The luggage compartment lights and the luggage 
compartment lid light are switched on directly via the tailgate contact switch.
