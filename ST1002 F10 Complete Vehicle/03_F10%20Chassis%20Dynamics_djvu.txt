3.4. Suspension/damping 

The FI 0 is equipped as standard with conventional shock absorbers and coil springs on the front and 
rear axle. EDC/VDC is optional and, depending on the model, is also available combined with ARS in 
the optional equipment Adaptive Drive (option 2VA). 

Electronic Damping Control, Active Roll Stabilization, and Adaptive Drive are available only in 
combination with the ZDH Dynamic Handling Package on the 535i and 550i. EDC is offered 
independently as an option on the 528i. 

The EDC is the same Vertical Dynamic Control (VDC) introduced with the E70/E71 and later installed 
on FOx models. 


12 












FI 0 Chassis Dynamics 

3. Chassis and Suspension 

The EDC/VDC is a sub-function of the Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM). The servomotors 
and sensors on the shock absorbers, referred to as satellites, are connected to the VDM control unit 
via FlexRay. The drive dynamic control switch in the center console makes it possible to select the 
damping characteristics, which are stored in the VDM control unit. 

Note: The EDC/VDC system is described in the F01/F02 "Vertical Dynamics Systems" training 
material available on TIS and ICP.

4.1. Service brake 

The FI 0 has a hydraulic dual-circuit brake system with a "front/rear split". Lightweight brake discs with 
riveted aluminium hubs are installed on all models. Conventional aluminium floating brake calipers are 
used on the front axle. Spheroidal graphite (SG iron) cast iron floating brake calipers with integrated 
EMF actuators (for the electromechanical parking brake) are used on the rear axle. 

As on all BMW vehicles the brake pad wear monitoring for the Condition Based Service display is 
used. 

The brake discs are ventilated at both the front and rear axle. 

The following tables list the brake dimensions of the various engine versions.

4.2. Electromechanical parking brake EMF 

The F10 uses an electromechanical parking brake EMF integrated into the rear brake calipers. 

The system is similar to the EMF system introduced in the E89 Z4. 

The use of the EMF offers the following advantages: 

• Operation via an ergonomic button in the center console 

• Reliable engaging and releasing of the EMF under all conditions 

• Automatic protection of the hydraulic holding functions (See FI 0 Automatic Hold Function 
and Active Cruise Control ACC) 

• A dynamic emergency braking function is ensured even with a low coefficient of friction via the 
(ABS) control systems 

• The discontinuation of the parking brake lever in the center console creates space for new 
equipment features.

DFA_EMF 

Redundant hard wired speed signal from DSC to EMF 


Note: The DFA_EMF is a hard wired signal from DSC to EMF which carries a wheel speed 
information. 

For safety reasons, it is very important, that the EMF NOT be activated as long as the vehicle is 
moving. Therefore the EMF uses two input signals to confirm vehicle speed: Bus-Signal and the 
DFA_EMF hard wired signal. 

4.2.3. System structure 

The EMF control unit receives the driver's command to engage the parking brake through the parking 
brake button. The vehicle condition is queried/detected via the electrical system connection and the 
bus systems. The control unit decides whether all conditions for engaging the parking brake are in 
place. If this is the case, the two EMF actuators on the rear brake calipers are activated.

The self-locking facility in the spindle maintains the tension force even when de-energized, and the 
vehicle is held securely in place. After the required force is reached, the detected status is indicated by 
a red indicator light in the instrument panel and an additional red LED in the parking brake button.

The driver can trigger the process of engaging the vehicle's parking brake by pulling the parking 
brake button. The operating direction is the same as the operating direction of the previously used 
mechanical parking brake lever. The signal from the parking brake button is read in by the EMF control 
unit. The EMF control unit activates the EMF actuators on the rear brake calipers individually. 

Engaging is possible in every logical terminal status. Engaging at terminal 0 is made possible by 
integrating terminal 30 into the EMF control unit. If the driver operates the parking brake button at 
terminal 0, the EMF control unit is woken up. The EMF control unit in turn wakes up the other control 
units on the vehicle. Only then can the EMF control unit receive the important information relating 
to vehicle standstill. In addition, the changed status of the parking brake can be displayed after the 
system has been woken up.

4. Brakes 


The status "parking brake engaged" is indicated by a red indicator light in the instrument panel and an 
additional red LED in the parking brake button. Once the parking brake is on, pulling the parking brake 
button again has no effect. 



F10 Indicator light, parking brake engaged display 


Rolling monitor with parking brake engaged 

The rolling monitor function is intended to prevent the vehicle from rolling with the parking brake 
engaged. Rolling monitor is engaged whenever a state change of the parking brake from "disengaged" 
to "engaged" takes place and ends following a defined time after this state change. 

A signal from the DSC is used as the input variable for roll-away detection. As soon as this signal 
indicates that the vehicle has started to roll away, a retensioning of the EMF actuators is carried out 
immediately. To do so, the EMF actuators are supplied with full current for 100 ms to increase the 
tension force. Afterwards, the system waits for 400 ms. If the vehicle rolls again, the retensioning 
process is repeated (a maximum of three times). If rolling of the vehicle is still detected after the third 
retensioning, the function ends with an entry in the fault memory. 

Temperature monitoring 

The temperature monitoring ensures compensation for the force reduction that takes effect from 
when hot brake discs cool off. The temperature monitoring is activated if the temperature exceeds a 
certain value during the state change of the parking brake from "released" to "engaged". 

The temperature of the brake discs is calculated individually for each wheel by the DSC control unit 
and transmitted to the EMF control unit. During the state change, the higher of the two brake disc 
temperatures is used for the temperature monitoring. The corresponding temperature ranges are 
stored in a characteristic map along with the corresponding retensioning times. 

Depending on the temperature during the state change, the corresponding retensioning times from 
the characteristic map are activated. When the first retensioning time is reached, the first retensioning 
takes place. After the second retensioning time expires, another retensioning takes place; yet another 
takes place after the third time expires. In the characteristic map, the value 0 can also be stored for one 
or more specific retensioning times. The respective retensioning operations are then omitted. The 
function ends when the last retensioning operation is completed. 

Disengaging the parking brake 

To disengage the parking brake, the parking brake button is pushed. However, for the parking brake 
to actually released, terminal 15 must also be ON and at least one of the following conditions must be 
met: 


The brake pedal must be depressed 

The automatic transmission parking lock must be engaged 

The clutch pedal actuated (vehicles with manual transmission only). 


25 



FI 0 Chassis Dynamics 

4. Brakes 


This prevents the vehicle rolling if, for example, another occupant of the vehicle (other than the driver) 
presses in the parking brake button. 

Once the parking brake is released, the red indicator lamp in the instrument panel and the red LED in 
the parking brake button go out. 

Activating the EMF actuator sets the spindle in motion. The spindle rotation moves the spindle nut 
away from the brake piston by a small defined distance. 

Dynamic emergency braking 

The law requires that vehicles have two means of applying the brakes (with the first being the brake 
pedal). In the FI 0, the second is the parking brake button on the center console. If the parking brake 
button is pulled while the vehicle is in motion, the dynamic emergency braking procedure is applied 
by the DSC system. This function is intended for emergency situations in which the driver is unable to 
apply the brakes by pressing the brake pedal. As a safety measure, other occupants of the vehicle can 
also use this to bring the vehicle to a stop if, for example, the driver suddenly loses consciousness. 

Dynamic emergency braking hydraulically applies brake pressure at all four brakes. The DSC functions 
are fully active and the brake lights are activated. That represents a major advantage over manual 
parking brakes. 

The dynamic emergency braking takes place only while the parking brake button is pulled. The 
deceleration set by the DSC is increased progressively. During the dynamic emergency braking, the 
EMF indicator light is activated in the instrument panel. In addition, a Check Control message and an 
audible warning signal are issued to make the driver aware of the critical situation. 

If the driver uses the brake pedal and pulls the parking brake button at the same time to slow down, the 
DSC control unit prioritizes. The greater braking requirement is put into effect. If dynamic emergency 
braking is continued to the point of standstill, the vehicle continues to be held stationary after the 
parking brake button is released. The EMF indicator light on the instrument cluster remains active. The 
driver can then release the parking brake once again (see "Releasing the parking brake"). 

Parking brake fault 

In the event of a fault of the parking brake, the EMF indicator light is activated and lights up in yellow in 
the instrument panel. A Check Control message is output.

Emergency release 

No emergency release of the parking brake is provided for the customer. 

The parking brake can be unlocked by unscrewing the EMF actuators and manually turning back the 
spindles. 

Note: No special tools are required to manually release the EMF at the calipers. 


26 



FI 0 Chassis Dynamics 

4. Brakes 


Changing the brake pads 

To change the brake pads, the EMF actuator must be in the completely open position so that the brake 
piston can be pushed back. The EMF actuators can be activated and moved into the completely open 
position with the BMW (ISTA) diagnostics system. This position is necessary to change the brake 
pads. Once the installation position is reached, the installation mode is set automatically. 



F10 Electromechanical parking brake with spindle nut in working position forexchanging the brake linings 


A _ 

Note: For safety reasons, as long as the EMF control unit is in installation mode, the parking 
brake cannot be activated. If the parking brake button is actuated despite this, the EMF 
indicator light flashes yellow in the instrument panel. 


Installation mode can be cancelled in two ways: 

• By running the "Reset installation mode" service function using ISTA 

• By driving the car; a programmed minimum speed has to be exceeded. 

After being changed, the brake pads must be bedded-in. This is necessary to ensure the brake pad 
and brake disc pairing assumes the specified friction parameters. Only then will the required braking 
force be reached. 

A 

Note: The exact procedure for bedding-in the service brakes is described in the Repair 
Instructions. The instructions must be followed exactly.

FI 0 Chassis Dynamics 

4. Brakes 


Brake test stand detection 

Based on a plausibility check (wheel speed comparison), the EMF control unit detects the brake test 
stand and switches to brake test stand mode. Detection takes approximately 6 seconds. 

By pulling the parking brake button multiple times in succession, the following target positions are 
approached: 

• Brake pads applied 

• Force 1 for the brake test stand 

• Force 2 for the brake test stand 

• Target force. 

Alternatively, the parking brake button can also be pulled for a longer time in brake test stand mode. 
The individual target positions are then cycled through, spaced 3 seconds apart. 

When the brake test stand mode is activated and the EMF actuators are released, the EMF indicator 
lamp flashes slowly. 

When the brake test stand mode is activated and the EMF actuators are partially engaged, the EMF 
indicator lamp starts flashing quickly. 

When the brake test stand mode is activated and the EMF actuators are completely engaged, the EMF 
indicator lamp is activated continuously. 

The parking brake can be disengaged on the brake test stand without the brake pedal or clutch pedal 
being pressed. The brake test stand mode is terminated automatically when the vehicle leaves the 
brake test stand. The mode is also deactivated when the parking brake button is pressed or a fault is 
present.

5. Steering 


A vehicle's steering plays a central role in the chassis and suspension. The technological innovations 
introduced by BMW like active steering and rear axle slip angle control, are also used in the FI 0. 
Futhermore, the steering is now implemented completely electrically with the use of EPS (Electronic 
Power Steering). 

This system is a modified and enhanced version of the E89 Z4 EPS.

5.1. Basic steering 

The FI 0 is the first BMW mid-range vehicle to be equipped with electromechanical power steering 
(EPS). The operating principle and structure of the EPS in the FI 0 is identical to that in the E89 and is 
explained the E89 Complete Vehicle training material under "Electric power steering with axial parallel 
arrangement (EPS w/APA)".

5.1.2. System overview 

The EPS enables average fuel consumption to be reduced by approx. 0.3 1/100 km (0.317 
quart/62miles) compared to a conventional hydraulic steering system. This contributes to a reduction 
of CO 2 emissions.

The EPS steering replaces the conventional hydraulic steering system. EPS is always equipped with 
the Servotronic function. Using the drive dynamic control switch, two different adjustments can be 
achieved: "Normal" and "Sporty". 

The EPS is less sensitive to disturbance variables such as bumps and steering wheel vibration. It also 
contributes to the driving safety of the FI 0 with an active roll damping. 

Because there is no oil in the EPS, it is more environmentally friendly than conventional hydraulic 
steering systems. 

The EPS has Active return to center, this delivers optimum drivability. The EPS also makes it possible 
for the parking assistance to be implemented for the first time in a BMW vehicle. 

For more information about parking assistance, refer to the "F10 Driver Assistance Systems" section 
in this training material. 


5.2. Integral Active Steering 

As with the F01 and F07, the optional equipment Integral Active Steering in the FI 0 is made up of two 
components: the rear axle slip angle control HSR and the active steering AL on the front axle. The EPS 
on the FI 0 has been especially adapted and modified to work with the active steering on the front axle. 

The components of Integral Active Steering, active steering and rear axle slip angle control, cannot be 
ordered separately, but only as the Integral Active Steering package (option 2VH).

In the FI 0, electromechanical power steering is combined for the first time with the active steering 
planetary gearbox with override function (already familiar from the F01). As a result, the steering is 
implemented completely electrically. 

Due to the higher weight of some engines and the higher steering forces associated with the greater 
front axle load, the power of a typical 12V steering system is no longer sufficient. For this reason, 
a 24V EPS system is installed in the FI 0, with the N63 engine and in conjunction with the optional 
Integral Active Steering equipment. 

The following table explains when a 24V EPS is installed.

Because active steering demands higher forces from the electromechanical steering, to comply with

by a separate positive battery connection point.

EPS with 24V 

The higher weight of V8 and Diesel engines result in a higher front axle load. This in turn causes the 
power required for the steering servo to increase. In conjunction with the active steering, an even 
higher exertion of force is applied, and therefore even higher current is required for the steering servo. 
These high current made it necessary to increase the voltage supply of the EPS to 24V. 

This requires an auxiliary battery, a separator and a charging unit for the auxiliary battery. These 
components are installed in the luggage compartment of the FI 0 550i (V8).

The BCU (charging unit) takes over the monitoring of the state of charge and the charging of the 
auxiliary battery with a 150W DC/DC converter. It monitors a cable (isolation) sheathing of the 24V 
line and it switches the relay in the separator with which the auxiliary battery is integrated into the 
circuit. The EPS is supplied with 24V only after this relay has been switched on. In the event of a fault, 
the EPS can also be operated with 12V. If there is no fault, the relay in the separator is switched as of 
terminal 15. 

The 24V line is routed on the vehicle floor and is surrounded by a cable sheath which is monitored by 
the charging unit (BCU). 

The following system wiring diagram details the various switch situations and the charging of the 
auxiliary battery.

The rear axle is equipped with integral active steering, thus increasing the comfort and driving 
dynamics. To review the operating principle of the integral active steering, refer to the F01/F02 
Chassis and Suspension and Lateral Dynamics System training material available on TIS and ICP. The 
components of Integral Active Steering include front active steering and rear axle slip angle control. 
The Integral Active Steering package (option 2VH) cannot be ordered separately on the FI 0, but only 
as is part of the (ZDH) Dynamic Handling Package. 

The (ZDH) Dynamic Handling Package also includes: Electronic Damping Control, Active Roll 
Stabilization and Adaptive Drive.

6.2. Dynamic Stability Control 

Dynamic Stability Control is standard in all BMW vehicles. 

The DSC prevents spinning of the drive wheels when starting up and when accelerating. 

The DSC also identifies unstable driving conditions, such as oversteer or understeer. The DSC helps 
to keep the vehicle on a safe course by applying brake interventions on the individual wheels (within 
the physical limits) and by reducing the engine output in order to control wheel spin and maintain 
traction. 

A_ 

It always remains the responsibility of the driver to adapt his or her driving style. 

Even with the DSC, the laws of physics still apply. 

Always Drive Safely! 


The DSC system control unit is attached to a hydraulic valve block and it includes many individual 
functions that are listed in the following table.

The F10 uses Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM) with Electronic Damper Control (EDC). 


Beginning with the F01/F02, the EDC is also called VDC (Vertical Dynamic Control) and is a 
function of the VDM. 


The VDM was introduced with the E70/E71, enhanced for the F01/F02 and now further developed for 
the FI 0. 


With Vertical Dynamics Control (VDC), independent electronic damper control for each wheel is 
possible, whereas EDC is only capable of front to rear adjustments. 

During this process, the servomotors and the sensors on the shock absorbers, known as satellites, are 
connected to the VDM control unit via FlexRay. 


The VDC and the Dynamic Drive (ARS for the vehicles BMW 535i, BMW 550i) are available only 
in combination as Adaptive Drive (option 2VA). EDC can only be ordered individually as optional 
equipment (option 223) on the BMW 528i.

6.4. Dynamic Drive (ARS) 

Dynamic Drive (ARS) was introduced for the first time in the E65/E66. As with EDC/VDC is mapped as 
a function in the VDM control unit. 

Adaptive Drive (option 2VA) is available as and option on the F10 (in the BMW 535i and BMW 550i 
only)

Driving dynamics control switch for equipment with Adaptive Drive 


In the FI 0 (as in F01 and F07) we can also control all drive and stability control systems in combination 
through the driving dynamics control switch. The operating principle is identical to that in the F01. For 
vehicles with Adaptive Drive (option 2VA), four different modes are available on the driving dynamics 
control switch. For vehicles without Adaptive Drive (option 2VA), the "Comfort" stage is omitted and 
only three different modes can be configured. The driving dynamics control switch is then labelled 
with "Normal" instead of “Comfort”. 

Note: Adaptive Drive combines EDC (Electronic Damper Control) with ARS (Active Roll 
Stabilization). 

Sport mode can be adapted using the controller.

You can determine whether the sport mode is to apply to the chassis and suspension only, to the drive, 
or to both simultaneously.
