2.3. N63 engine 



N63 engine 


The N63 engine is the successor of the N62 engine and the world's first engine with optimized 
package thanks to the placement of the turbochargers and the main catalytic converters. In order 
to obtain performance goals with the optimum package and weight, the two turbochargers and the 
catalytic converters have been placed in the engine V-space between the cylinder banks, which meant 
reversing the positions of the intake and outlet ports. This arrangement allows short pipe lengths and 
large cross-sections, which in turn minimizes the pressure losses on the intake and exhaust side. 


Highlights 


• Use across all series (E71/E72/F01/F02/F04/F07/F10) 

• Twin turbochargers placed in the engine V-space 

• Catalytic converters close to the engine 

• Direct fuel injection piezo-electric injectors 

• MSD85 Digital Motor Electronics, liquid-cooled with FlexRay connection 

• Indirect charge air cooling

2.4.2. Engine identification 

To ensure clear identification and classification, the engines have an identification mark on the 
crankcase. 

This engine identification is also necessary for approval by authorities. The N55 engine is 
accompanied by a further development of this identification and a reduction from the former eight 
characters to seven characters. The engine number is located on the engine below the engine 
identification. This consecutive number, in conjunction with the engine identification, permits unique 
identification of each individual engine.

3.3. K manual transmission 

The K manual transmission is a six-gear inline manual transmission in reduction gear design. 

Highlights 


14 










F10 Powertrain 
3. Manual Transmission 

• Six gears with optimized ratios 

• Intermediate mounting 

• Dry sump lubrication 

• Fuel consumption reduction (-2 % compared to G manual transmission) 

• Weight reduction (-11 kg compared to G manual transmission) 

• Synchronization with carbon friction linings 

• Use of life-time oil filling 

• Zero-gear sensor for automatic engine start-stop function. 

Instead of the G transmission used with the N63 engine the smaller, lighter and more cost-efficient 
K transmission is installed with the N55. The weight advantage is up to 11 kg. This transmission is 
smaller and lighter due mainly to the intermediate mounting of the main shafts and a modified gear set 
design. 

Another advantage is the significantly improved shifting comfort and the low fuel consumption due to 
low drag losses and high efficiency. 

The shift quality is increased substantially by: 

• Using a newly developed carbon friction lining in the synchronizer units 

• A newly developed and very low-friction gearshift 

• The low drag loss of the gear set 

• Limiting excessive shift travel

To keep the drag loss low, dry sump lubrication is used for the first time. Compared to conventional 
splash lubrication, this prevents the gear set from splashing about in the oil sump, which causes 
losses. An additional decrease in losses is attained with the use of redesigned radial shaft seals. 

3.3.1. Intermediate mounting 

In manual transmissions with reduction gear design, the main shaft is pushed away from the 
counter shaft by the gearing forces. This causes a deviation of the ideal gear contact pattern, which 
substantially impairs the strength of the gears and causes noise. 

Therefore, in the K transmission, the location of the countershaft significantly restricts the shafts from 
bending. In this way, higher torque can be transmitted, compared to conventional transmissions, while 
at the same time reducing gear noise. 


16 








F10 Powertrain 
3. Manual Transmission 

3.3.2. Dry sump lubrication 

Conventional manual transmissions normally use splash lubrication. During this process, the gears 
on the countershaft dip into the transmission oil and distribute it throughout the transmission in a 
disorderly manner as the gear set rotates. Often, additional equipment such as oil partition plates or oil 
grooves are required to bring the oil to the gears, the bearings or to the synchronizers. 

In the K transmission, a dry sump type lubrication system is used (for the first time on a BMW). 

The dry sump system consists of: 

• An oil filter 

• An oil pump 

• A fuel injection pipe 

Using less energy than a splash lubrication system, the dry sump system lubricates the gears, the 
bearings and the synchronizers in a more targeted manner. The controlled oil flow also results in an 
improved temperature balance, as the cooling air is routed directly from the vehicle underbody to the 
filter intake opening. This provides continuous cooling of the transmission oil. 

The oil filter also improves the oil quality and thus the load-carrying capacity of the gear train. 

3.3.3. Synchronization 

In first and second gear, triple-cone synchronizers are used. In the other gears, single-cone 
synchronizers are installed. To improve shift quality, these are equipped with a newly developed carbon 
friction lining. 

3.3.4. Connection dimensions 

The connection dimensions for the transmission mounting have been taken over from previous series 
applications. In this way, the integration into the vehicle environment has been simplified greatly, as it is 
possible continue using existing peripherals.

3.4. G manual transmission 

The G manual transmission is of the highest precision, operational smoothness and shifting comfort. 
Due to the total spread, the transmission offers the best possible utilization of the engine performance. 
The short shift travel of 55 mm contributes to the transmission shifting comfort. 

Highlights 

• Slip suppression to prevent clutch slipping 

• Start-up speed limitation to minimize the friction work of the clutch (in conjunction with N63 
engine) 

• External transmission oil cooling (in conjunction with N63 engine) 

• Use of long-term oil. 

To prevent potential overloading of the clutch a slip suppression system is used. This system enables 
acceleration under full load without the possibility of the clutch slipping. A speed sensor on the 
intermediate shaft and the crankshaft sensor calculate the clutch slip; if necessary, the engine torque 
can be reduced to limit clutch slip. 

A start-up speed limitation is used with the N63 engine. This limits the engine speed while the vehicle 
is at a standstill, depending on the mode of the Dynamic Stability Control DSC, to 3500 - 5500 rpm. 
This prevents a overheating of the drive plate during the starting process. 

The external transmission oil cooling is used with the N63 engine, guarantees reliable operation, 
even under extreme conditions. A transmission oil pump pumps the transmission oil through the 
transmission oil cooler. A transmission oil temperature sensor is installed in the transmission, which 
switches the transmission oil pump on (transmission oil temperature >130 °C/266°F) and off 
(transmission oil temperature <110 °C/230°F).

4.3. GA8HP transmission 

In the FI 0, the new automatic transmissions GA8HP45Z and GA8HP70Z with eight forward gears and 
one reverse gear is used.

4. Automatic Transmission 



Highlights 

• Significantly enhanced gearshifts spontaneity 

• Greater driving and shifting comfort as a result of a closer gear ratio 

• Higher precision control of the converter lockup clutch at low engine loads 

• High power transmission of the converter lock-up clutch 

• Reduced fuel consumption (-5 to -6 %). 

The GA8HP45Z and GA8HP70Z are new developments and will gradually replace the established 
6-speed automatic transmissions GA6HP19Z TU and GA6HP26Z TU. The overall gear ratio has 
been increased from 6.04 to 7.07; the gear to gear ratios have are now closer, thus also reducing the 
differences in speed when shifting gear. The weight of the transmission has been reduced significantly 
using a plastic oil pan and other light weight components. 

The Electronic Transmission Control (EGS) control unit is integrated in the control unit framework of 
the electronic immobilizer EWS. This provides better protection against theft. 

The operation takes place using the gear selector switch or the shift paddles (option 2TB, sport 
automatic transmission, via the steering column switch cluster SZL). 

In the converter, second-generation mechanical torsional vibration dampers are used:

4. Automatic Transmission 


The function and structure of the torque converter are described in the “E70 Automatic transmission” 
training material available on TIS and ICR 

The vibration isolation reduces the proportion of slip on the converter lockup clutch and enables a 
larger operating range with the converter lockup clutch closed. This reduces the fuel consumption by 
5% to 6% in the consumption cycle (KV01) compared to the TU 6-speed automatic transmission used 
until now.

6. Driveshaft and Axle Shafts 

6.1. Driveshaft 

6.1.1. Overview 

Each engine-transmission configuration uses a steel driveshaft that is specially adapted to the 
individual torque requirement. 

The main focal points in the design of the driveshaft of the FI 0 were the torque transfer and comfort 
requirements with minimal acoustics and vibrations. 

The joints, shaft divisions and shaft diameters have been specified in such a way that they do not pass 
on any disruptive noises or vibrations to the connection points at the body. 

On the F10, the driveshafts are connected to the automatic transmission and rear differentials 
exclusively by means of flexible discs. This minimizes the high-frequency tooth meshing noises on the 
rear differential.

6.1.2. Crash function 

The driveshaft absorbs some of the impact energy in the event of a head-on collision. Improvements 
have been made to the properties of this crash function, which are integrated into the front driveshaft 
tube. The compression force under which the front driveshaft tube is meant to deform has been 
further reduced with no effect on torque transfer capability.

F10 Output shaft 

The FI 0 has output shafts inserted at the wheel and axle differential ends. 

The design of the journal at the rear axle differential end depends on the size of the rear axle 
differential. The journal at the wheel hub end comes in only the one size. 

Due to the position of the rear axle differential, the axle shafts on the left and right have different overall 
lengths. 

The shaft between the two joints is designed as a torsionally rigid hollow shaft.
