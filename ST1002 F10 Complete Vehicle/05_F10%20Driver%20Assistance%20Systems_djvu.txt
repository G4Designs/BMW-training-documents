2. Active Blind Spot Detection 

The active blind spot detection system (option 5AG) is meant to assist the driver during lane changes. 
To do this, the active blind spot detection system monitors traffic at the rear and sides of the vehicle 
with two radar sensors. The radar sensors are located above the rear bumper support. 

You can see the components that make up the active blind spot detection system in the following 
graphic.

2. Active Blind Spot Detection 

If the driver intends to change lanes in this situation and indicates this by operating the turn indicator, 
the driver is warned by a vibrating steering wheel and a flashing warning light in the exterior mirror.

For more information on the active blind spot detection system, refer to the F01/F02 training material 
available on TIS and ICR 

A 

Note: The system is not a substitute for the driver’s assessment of the traffic situation. In the event of a 
warning, do not turn the steering wheel with unnecessary force, as this could cause the vehicle to vier 
and lose control.

F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

3. Lane Departure Warning 

The lane departure warning (option 5AD) warns the driver in the event that the vehicle deviates 
from the lane it is currently traveling without the driver's intention. For this function to work properly 
recognizable road and lane markings should be present and detected by the system. The KAFAS 
control unit performs an evaluation of the images recorded by the forward-pointing video camera, 
located near the rear-view mirror base. 

Although the driver continues to have full responsibility for driving the vehicle, the system is only 
designed to assist the driver in case of a lapse of attention. 

This system is will only operate as intended on highways, major roads and well maintained country 
roads. Therefore, warnings are only given at speeds of over 70 km/h/43mph. 

The driver activates the system using the lane departure warning button in the driver assistance 
control panel (to the left of the steering column). 

The following graphic contains the components of the lane departure warning system.

4. High-beam Assistant 

The high-beam assistant FLA (option 5AC) assists the customer with the use of the high-beam 
headlights. Depending on the traffic situation, prevailing ambient light conditions and which vehicle 
lights are on, the FLA automatically switches the high-beam headlights on or off and thereby assists or 
relieves the driver of having to operate the high-beam headlights. 

High beam can still be switched on and off manually as usual. The driver always has the capability, and 
the obligation, to override the system whenever the situation is required. 

In the FI 0, the high-beam assistant option can only be ordered with the ZDA Driver Assistance 
Package 

• Lane departure warning and the high-beam assistant functions are combined in the KAFAS 
control unit and share the same video camera. 

The FLA video camera is a simplified image sensor that can detect light color and intensity.

The high-beam assistant is not a substitute for the driver’s decision of when to use the high-beam 
headlights. For safety reasons, always manually dip the high-beam headlights when confronted with 
oncoming traffic.

5. Park Distance Control 


The Park Distance Control PDC (option 508) assists the driver when maneuvering in and out of parking 
spaces. Acoustic signals and a visual display indicate the current distance to an obstacle. The Park 
Distance Control of the FI 0 is similar to the F01/F02/F07 and uses the measured data from four 
ultrasonic sensors on both the front and rear bumper. 

PDC is activated when reverse is engaged or the PDC button is pressed. The PDC button is located 
next to the electronic gear selector/switch. 

The audible and visual distance warnings are the results of distance measurements and are provided 
to the driver via the speaker system and by displays in the CID respectively. 



F10 Distance warning display in the CID 


For more information on the Park Distance Control system, refer to the F01/F02 training material under 
PDC, TRSVC, available on TIS and ICP. 


A_ 

The PDC is not a substitute for the driver’s assessment of the traffic situation. The driver must always 
obtain a direct view of the situation all round the vehicle in order to assess the traffic situation. Failure 
to exercise due diligence in this way could result in an accident risk on account of road users or objects 
not located within the detection range of the PDC. Loud sounds outside and inside the car can render 
the PDC signal inaudible.

F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

6. Parking Assistant 

For the first time in a BMW vehicle, a system is being introduced in the FI 0 that assists the driver 
when performing a parallel parking maneuver. Parking Assistant is available as optional equipment 
(option 5DP) in conjunction with the optional Park Distance Control (option 508). 

Parking Assistant makes it easier to maneuver the vehicle into parking spaces parallel to the roadway. 
The system measures potential parking spaces (on both sides of the road) when driving by them 
at speeds less than 35 km/h/22mph, regardless of whether parking assistant has been activated 
or not. When a parking space 1.2m larger than the vehicle length is detected and the system has 
been activated, the space is shown to the driver in the central information display. The driver remains 
responsible for the acceleration and braking of the vehicle while the parking assistant system takes 
over only the steering function and the PDC monitors the distances and obstacles. The driver is led 
through the parallel parking process with detailed instructions for action displayed on the CID and, 
where applicable, additional acoustic warnings and acknowledgements are issued. 

A 

The Parking Assistant system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility. 

The driver is still responsible for monitoring the parking space and the parking process. The driver 
should intervene if necessary in order to avoid any potential accident.

6.1.2. Sensors 


The two ultrasonic sensors of parking assistant are integrated in the side marker turn signal indicators 
(installed in the front fenders). 

The function of these two ultrasonic sensors is similar to the function of the ultrasonic sensors of 
the Park Distance Control (PDC). Ultrasonic pulses are sent out and echo impulses are received. The 
signals are evaluated by the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) control unit. This is used along with 
the distance information from the Dynamic Stability Control to calculate the length and width of the 


parking space. 

The ultrasonic sensors communicate with the parking assistance control unit via a LIN-Bus.

6.1.3. Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) 

The Parking assistant control module or Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) is located in the 
luggage compartment behind the battery (beneath the trunk latch mechanism). It evaluates the signals 
from the sensors and thereby determines potential parking spaces. It also calculates the optimum path 
into a parking space and monitors the parking process. It activates the electromechanical steering via 
the ICM.

6.2. Parking Process 


6.2.1. Measuring parking spaces 

At a speed of up to 35 km/h/22mph and a maximum distance of 1.5 m/5 ft. from the row of parked 
vehicles, the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) determines suitable parking spaces using the 
wheel speed and the sensor data from the respective ultrasonic sensor. The parking space length is 
determined from the distance travelled based on the distance signals and from the sensor data from 
the ultrasonic sensors. The width of the parking space is determined using the sensor data from the 
ultrasonic sensor. 



F10 Parking space measurement 


The following preconditions are placed on the parking space: 


19 







F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

6. Parking Assistant 

• The parking space must be between two objects each with a minimum length of about 
1.5 meters (5 feet). 

• The minimum width of the parking space must be about 1.5 meters (5 feet). 

• The minimum length of the parking space must be at least the length of your vehicle plus 
about 1.2 meters (4 feet). 

The requirements for the parking space and the opening angles of the ultrasonic sensor can be seen 
in the following graphic.

6.2.2. Activation 

Basically there are two options for activating parking assistant: 

• Activation via the park button in the center console 

• Activation via "shifting into reverse gear" and then operating the controller. 


Activation via the park button 

For activation via the park button, the parking display appears in the central information display. As 
soon as a parking space has been found, the driver needs only to shift into reverse gear to use the 
parking assistant system.

Activation by "shifting into reverse gear" 

When you shift into reverse gear, the parking display appears in the central information display; 
however, the parking assistant is not yet activated. Even in this state, parking spaces are already being 
measured and, where applicable, displayed. To park using the system, the controller must be operated.

6.2.3. Schedule of events 

The sequence described here is with the parking assistant is already activated. 

A 

The Parking Assistant system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility when parking. 

For safety reasons, the driver must always monitor the parking space and the parking process and 
intervene if necessary. 


The Parking Assistant assists the driver in searching for a suitable parking space. If a suitable parking 
space (vehicle length plus 1.2 m/4 ft.) has been found while travelling forwards, the driver is directed to 
this parking space by a blue-lit parking space on the corresponding side of the vehicle and the blue-lit 
“P” in the central information display. The parking process with parking assistant can only be carried 
out in reverse. 

By using the turn indicator, the "parking space search" display or "suitable parking space" on the 
opposite side disappears from the central information display. Parking spaces on this side continue to 
be measured in the background. 

If a parking space has been found on the passenger side, the driver can use the parking assistant to 
maneuver into the parking space without using a turn signal. You can drive into a parking space on the 
driver's side only by using the left turn signal. 

If a parking space has been found and the driver does not use a turn signal indicator, the central 
information display prompts the driver to do so.

After the vehicle has come to a complete stop, the driver is prompted to shift into reverse and let 
go of the steering wheel. If the driver grabs the steering wheel during the parking process, parking 
assistance is terminated. If need be, the parking process can later be resumed. Thus the driver can 
end the parking process at any time. 

The PMA control unit calculates an optimum path for the parking process. The steering, and thus 
the transverse control, is taken over by activating the electromechanical power steering (EPS) via the 
Integrated Chassis Management (ICM). Communication between the control units takes place via the 
FlexRay data bus.

Once the driver has shifted into reverse and lets go of the steering wheel, the parking process can be 
started with the parking assistant. The parking assistant takes over the control of steering once the 
vehicle is shifted into reverse. This is indicated by a steering wheel symbol in the central information 
display. The "Drive slowly in reverse and brake" prompt appears in the central information display.

While the vehicle is moving, the driver must continuously observe the traffic and that what is 
happening around the vehicle. During the parking process, The parking assistant only takes over the 
steering of the vehicle, the driver is still responsible for accelerating and braking and thus safely driving 
the vehicle. 



F10 Parking process 


While driving in reverse, the driver is continuously shown the parking display in the central information 
display. The path during the parking process is continuously monitored by the PMA and corrected if 
necessary.

In the event that the parking assistant does not make it into the parking space in one try, it prompts 
the driver to drive forwards upon reaching a certain precalculated point. In some cases, the sensor 
data from the Park Distance Control will also be used to do this. The prompt appears in the central 
information display and an acoustic signal is emitted. The prompt to change directions repeats until 
the vehicle is completely in the parking space.

Explanation

Parking completed, please secure the vehicle. 


The parking process is cancelled in the following cases: 


• Maximum parking speed of 10 km/h (6 mph) exceeded 

• Incorrect selection of turn signal indicator (for example left instead of right) 

• The driver turns the steering wheel 

• A door is opened 

• Incorrect gear selection 

• DSC detects a slip. 

Each of these reasons for cancelling the process is documented in the fault memory of the Parking 
Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) with an info entry. Consequently, this is not a system fault, but incorrect 
operation by the user. After a cancellation, the system checks to see whether it is possible to resume 
the parking process. The driver can immediately resume the parking process where appropriate.

6.2.4. Service Information 

Notes for Service 

After replacing the PMA or an ultrasonic sensor, no special start-up is required. However, each time the 
start-up process begins, the control unit checks whether the sensor software is compatible with the 
control unit software. In the event that they are not compatible, a corresponding fault code is set in the 
PMA control unit. In this case, the "Update software of the ultrasonic sensors" service function must 
be carried out. 

The PMA monitors itself for faults and, if necessary, makes the corresponding fault entries. In 
exceptional cases, this is not always possible. The control unit cannot detect if the ultrasonic sensors 
(including the sealing ring) are incorrectly installed or clipped, or if the side wall in the area of the 
ultrasonic sensors is damaged. 

This can lead to the following customer complaints without fault entries: 

• Small parking spaces are only rarely detected 

• While parking, the vehicle drives very close to or very far from the vehicle in front of the parking 
space 

• After the parking process, the vehicle is either far from, very close to or on the curb 

• The vehicle is crooked in the parking space. 

In this case, the ultrasonic sensors must be checked for correct installation and damage on the side 
wall in the area of the ultrasonic sensors must be ruled out. 

Parking assistant relieves the driver in two respects. First, from the task of estimating the size of a 
parking space and deciding based on this whether the space is large enough. Second, from the task 
of steering into the space on his or her own. Braking and accelerating the vehicle still remains the 
responsibility of the driver. While searching for a parking space and parking, the driver is presented 
with all relevant information, from the results of the parking space measurement, to the parking 
assistant status and corresponding handling instructions, to the distances to other objects, e.g. via the 
PDC image in an integrated display. This makes it particularly easy to monitor the parking process and 
simultaneously control the vehicle.

7. Surround View 


A “Surround View” of the entire vehicle can be displayed in the CID with the combination of the Side 
View and Top View cameras systems (option 5DL). It can only be ordered as part of the ZCE Camera 
Package, in conjunction with the rear view camera (option 3AG) and Park Distance Control (option 
508). 

The Side View and Top View systems can no longer be ordered individually. 


7.1. Side View 

The Side View Camera function was first introduced in a BMW with the F01/F02 and is now installed in 
the FI 0. This feature makes it easier for the driver to pull into roads or tight intersections in which the 
driver's view to the side is obstructed. The function is implemented by two digital cameras installed on 
the right and left front wheel arches. 

The driver can activate the Side View using a button in the control panel next to the gear selector lever 
or with the iDrive controller.

The video camera images are shown in the CID in a split screen display up to 30 km/h,. Like the top 
and rear view cameras, the two bumper cameras send their signals to the TRSVC control unit via LVDS 
data lines. The signals are then forwarded via CVBS (composite video) lines to the video switch (VSW) 
and to the CIC. The CIC transmits the image data via LVDS data lines to the CID where it is displayed.

For more information on the Side View Camera system, refer to F01/F02 training material under "PDC, 
TRSVC” available on ICP and TIS. 

A 

The driver must always obtain a direct view all round the vehicle in order to assess the driving situation. 
Failure to do so could result in an accident, in case pedestrians or objects are found beyond the 
viewing range of the bumper cameras. 


7.2. Top View 

The Top View function familiar from the F07 is also offered in the FI 0. It is included in the optional 
equipment as part of the ZCE Camera Package. 

With the Top View function, two exterior mirror cameras show the driver a view of the sides of the 
vehicle from above. The image is displayed on the CID. This enables the driver to see areas around the 
vehicle that are not directly visible both when parking and when driving slowly.

Top View uses both the exterior mirror cameras and the rear view camera to generate the image. 

Like the side and rear view cameras, the two top view cameras send their signals to the TRSVC control 
unit via LVDS data lines. 

The driver is shown the turning-circle and tracking lines already familiar from the rear view camera 
system on previous vehicles.

on level roads. 

The tracking line depends on the steering angle and changes continuously in response to movements 
of the steering wheel.

The driver must always obtain a direct view all round the vehicle in order to assess the driving situation. 
Failure to exercise due diligence could result in an accident involving other road users or objects 
outside of the viewing range of the cameras.

8. DCC 

8.1. Introduction 

The cruise control with braking function has been used in many BMW models since the BMW 3 Series 
(E9x). It is also called "Dynamic Cruise Control" (DCC) and installed in the FI 0 as standard. It relieves 
the burden on the driver on quiet roads by maintaining a constant speed regardless of the resistance 
to vehicle motion (gradient, payload). Despite the support offered by this and other systems, the driver 
invariably bears full and sole responsibility for control of the vehicle. The driver can brake or accelerate 
at any time to override the DCC function. 

DCC also offers the driver the option of adjusting the set speed in small or large increments, which is 
then set and maintained by the system by controlling power output and braking. The brakes are also 
controlled during steep downhill driving if sufficient deceleration is not achieved by engine drag-torque 
alone. 

The cruise control with braking function is implemented in the FI 0 within the ICM control unit. 


8.2. Control functions 


8.2.1. Cruise control 

Cruise control computes a target acceleration or target deceleration on the basis of the set speed 
input by the driver and the car's actual speed. 

8.2.2. Acceleration and deceleration 

The driver can specify the set speed or acceleration by using the rocker switch on the multifunction 
steering wheel. 

8.2.3. Cruise control in curves 

This function, also known as "lateral acceleration control", is designed to prevent the lateral 
acceleration forces generated by cornering from rising above a certain level of perceived comfort 
when the car is being driven with the cruise control engaged. Driving speed and yaw rate are used to 
compute a figure for lateral acceleration. This value is compared to a speed-dependent limit value in 
order to achieve the following, seemingly contradictory objectives: 

• if the driver takes complete control, disruptive and overly restricted interventions are avoided, 
even if the car is driven at high speed. 

• Most car occupants find high lateral acceleration uncomfortable so useful interventions 
and a perceptible restriction on dynamic handling at higher speeds are applied under these 
circumstances. 

The output variable from cornering speed control is also a set-point for longitudinal acceleration. 


31 



F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

8. DCC 


8.2.4. Prioritization of the set-point value 

A set-point value is selected as highest-priority set-point from the set of longitudinal-acceleration set- 
points obtained from the above-mentioned control functions; this selection is situation-dependent. 
Signal filtering is applied to prevent sudden jumps when the system switches from the set-points. 

8.2.5. Interference-force estimation 

An acceleration or deceleration force has to be calculated so that the prioritized longitudinal 
acceleration can be implemented using the actuators. Example: when the car is driving up hill 
the propulsive forces needed in order to achieve a given longitudinal acceleration are higher than 
when the car is travelling on a flat surface. Deceleration as the car ascends a gradient, on the other 
hand, requires less braking force than is the case on the flat. If these forces are to be computed 
correctly, exact values are required not only for the gradient, but also for the mass of the vehicle, rolling 
resistance, drag and other accelerating forces. There is no adequate system of sensors for all these 
interfering forces, so an estimated value is derived from a comparison of the following two variables: 

• actual motion variables of the vehicle 

• expected motion variables of the vehicle, forecast on the basis of the driving and braking 
forces currently applied. 

The magnitude of the interference force estimated in this way is taken into account by addition or 
subtraction in the subsequent processing of the longitudinal-acceleration set-point. 

8.2.6. Activation of the actuators 

Driving forces and/or braking forces have to be applied in order to achieve the longitudinal acceleration 
computed by the control functions and thereby compensate for the acting interference forces. Usually 
a set-point is given for the drive train to accelerate the vehicle. In the exceptional circumstances that 
apply going down a steep hill, it might also be necessary to apply the brakes in order to limit the 
acceleration to a certain value. 

If the vehicle needs to be decelerated, first the magnitude of the drive train's potential deceleration 
percentage is determined, and thus the braking effect of the engine and transmission. This value 
is sent to the Digital Motor Electronics or the Digital Diesel Electronics and electronic transmission 
control. If the drive train is unable to achieve this value alone, the additionally required value is sent to 
the Dynamic Stability Control. 

If the brakes are perceptibly actuated to achieve the desired degree of vehicle deceleration, the car's 
brake lights are also actuated.

9. ACC Stop & Go 

9.1. Introduction 

The optional Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function (ACC Stop & Go) offers optimum 
assistance to the driver not only in smoothly flowing traffic but also in traffic jam situations. 

The Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function (option 5DF) can be ordered only in conjunction 
with an automatic transmission (option 205 or option 2TB). 

The purpose of ACC Stop & Go is to relieve the strain on the driver, therefore, further enhancing 
comfort and convenience. 

The connection between the ACC Stop & Go equipment and the navigation system (as on the E60) is 
no longer necessary as from the introduction of the FI 0. In the E60, the navigation data was required 
in order to switch off the short-range radar sensors of the ACC Stop & Go in the vicinity of radio 
astronomical telescope/stations. The radar waves of the new ACC Stop & Go sensors no longer 
disrupt function of these radio telescopes, and therefore they no longer need to be switched off in their 
vicinity. 

Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function is a system designed to ease the strain on the driver, 
but it is by no means intended as a system that can relieve the driver of the obligation to exercise due 
diligence at all times. The driver bears full responsibility at all times for using the system in a practical 
way. It is self-evident that the driver must remain fully aware of traffic conditions at all times; this 
system simply makes it easier for the driver to do just that. 

Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function is designed to operate from high speeds down to a 
complete standstill. Speed and distance from the vehicle in front are automatically controlled in this 
speed range. 



F10 Active Cruise Control 

Active Cruise Control regulates speed when the road ahead is clear and switches automatically to 
distance control when the sensor for ACC Stop & Go detects a slower moving vehicle in the lane 
ahead. In this way Active Cruise Control not only assists the driver on little-used roads, but also in 
heavy traffic. Active Cruise Control takes over the routine of accelerating and braking for precision 
adjustment of distance and speed to suit other road users. 


33 








F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. ACC Stop & Go 



FI 0 Active Cruise Control 

The Stop & Go function of the Active Cruise Control brings the vehicle to a complete stop if necessary. 
If the vehicle ahead begins to move again after having stopped, the driver is notified. To pull away 
again, the driver has to acknowledge this message. The pulling-away process is controlled fully 
automatically by ACC Stop & Go only if the duration of the standstill is very short. 

This way ACC Stop & Go assists the driver not only in flowing traffic, but also in traffic jam situations. 
However, is not suited for use in urban areas for negotiating junctions or traffic lights. 

The following aspects of the ACC Stop & Go assist system are considered in more detail here: 

• System components 

• Information regarding the vicinity of the car in front 

• Control functions 

• Operation and display 

• Behavior in response to driver's intention to exit the vehicle 

• Monitoring functions.

9.2.2. Sensor for ACC Stop & Go 

The sensor for ACC Stop & Go is a radar-based sensor for detecting the area ahead of the vehicle. 

Both the short and long range are detected by a sensor using internal electronic and mechatronic 
measures. The transmission frequency is 76-77 GHz. 

The sensor sends out focused electromagnetic waves. The echoes reflected from objects are received 
and evaluated by the sensor. In this way, the sensor can gain information about objects in front of it. 
This information includes size, distance and the speed.

In order to achieve a low overall height for the sensor, complex measures have been taken inside the 
sensor. There is a continuously rotating roller inside the sensor. The roller has various mouldings and 
emits electromagnetic waves with various characteristics, depending on the range to be detected. 
Thus both the short and long range are detected with each revolution of the roller. The roller turns at 
900 rpm using a brushless motor. Since the sensor becomes functional only upon reaching this speed, 
in cold temperatures, it can sometimes take a certain time for the sensor to become available. The 
cover of the sensor is coated with a transreflective layer. This is permits the penetration and passage 
of waves at a certain angle to allow beams to enter and exit. The beams are led through the waveguide 


39 







F10 Driver Assistance Systems

and reflected on the transreflective layer. At a shallower angle, it is reflective in order to guide beams 
within the housing to the various components. They strike the mirror, upon which the waves have 
their phase rotated and are reflected. Then they leave the housing through the transreflective layer. If 
these beams strike objects, they are reflected from these and travel back to the sensor. The beams 
are captured and measured in the waveguide. The evaluation electronics within the sensor evaluates 
these beams and forwards detected objects via the CAN bus to the Integrated Chassis Management.

components. 

The sensor for ACC Stop & Go is connected by a waterproof plug connection to the sensor CAN, 
terminal 15 N, and ground. The sensor for ACC Stop & Go receives its power supply via terminal 15N, 
so it is switched on and off with this supply. Terminal 15N is tapped off at the front fuse carrier. There 
is a fault memory in the sensor for ACC Stop & Go. The fault memory can be read out in diagnosis via 
Integrated Chassis Management. If the sensor is defective, replace it and calibrate the new sensor. 

The following graphic shows the working range of the sensor with a large opening angle for short 
range and a small opening angle for long range detection.

F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. ACC Stop & Go 

If ACC Stop & Go brings the car to a standstill on account of an object it has detected, the ACC sensor 
switches to a reduced-power mode (FCC requirement). When driving resumes or automatic drive off 
is active (set speed LED in the speed reading is green), it is switched back to normal power. Short and 
long range are permanently scanned and the detected objects are combined. 

The following is an overview of faults that can occur when using the ACC Stop & Go. 

• If the ACC Stop & Go Sensor is dirty 

The sensor can no longer function reliably if the antenna is obscured by snow, slush or ice. If 
this condition is detected, a corresponding signal is sent to Integrated Chassis Management 
(ICM) and the ACC Stop & Go function is deactivated as a result. A Check Control message 
informs the driver about this special case. At the same time a fault entry is stored in the ACC 
sensor. 

• External disruption of radar-signal processing 

Radar sensors used by other automobile manufacturers can disrupt the signal evaluation 
of the ACC sensor. If such a problem is detected, the ACC Stop & Go is deactivated. It can 
be switched on again by the driver as soon as the car is far enough away from the vehicle 
causing the interference. This fault is stored in the fault memory of the Integrated Chassis 
Management and of the ACC sensor. This does not, however, necessitate any repair 
measures. Instead, the customer should be informed of the cause of the fault, which is 
external interference. 

• Temporary faults 

The potential causes of this type of fault include communication faults, overvoltage, 
undervoltage and thermal overloads in the ACC sensor. In these cases, it is necessary to 
proceed as instructed by the test plan in the diagnostic system. Do not replace the ACC 
sensor until the test schedule prompts you to do so. 

• Control unit fault 

If the ACC sensor is affected by a control unit fault, the only way to rectify the fault is to replace 
the defective sensor. 

• Misaligned Sensor 

The interaction between the ACC Stop & Go sensor and the Integrated Chassis Management 
can detect misalignment caused by an accident (e.g. by bumping something while parking or 
being bumped when parked). If the computed maladjustment drift exceeds a certain threshold 
the ACC Stop & Go function is switched off. A fault entry indicates the cause of the fault. To 
correct the fault, observe the instructions in the diagnostic system and Repair Instructions. 

If the ACC Stop & Go sensor is replaced, the diagnosis system must be used to perform a start-up 
procedure to initialize the sensor. In the course of the start-up procedure, the installation position is 
entered in the newly installed sensor and it is adjusted. An adjustment may also be required after an 
accident without damage to the sensor. 

A 

Note: Always follow proper repair instructions. 


It is essential to observe the following important notes in order to adjust the ACC Stop & Go sensor 
properly: 


42 



F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. ACC Stop & Go 


• Make sure the measurement setup is exactly in accordance with the repair instructions 

• Park the vehicle on a perfectly smooth, level surface 

• Connect the ISTA diagnosis system 

• Make sure that the reflector for adjusting the ACC Stop & Go sensor is correctly positioned 

• Perform the adjustment in accordance with the action plan in diagnosis 

• Complete the adjustment and clear fault memory, etc. 


A 

Note: The ACC Stop & Go sensor must not be adjusted mechanically. Only the housing can be 
mechanically aligned, the fine adjustment occurs within the sensor. 


A _ 

Extra care must taken while doing repair work on the front end of these vehicles. If the bumper support 
is deformed or if there are scratches on the cover of the ACC Stop & Go sensor, there is a possibility 
of the sensor failing to work correctly. It is essential to follow the repair instructions when dealing with 
these components.

9.2.3. Integrated Chassis Management 

You will find a precise description of the Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) in the F01 driving 
stability control training material available on TIS and ICR The present document provides a brief 
overview and covers points of interest relating to the topics featured here. 

The Integrated Chassis Management in the F10 calculates for the control functions, sensor data 
and vehicle values that influence the longitudinal and transverse dynamics. The Integrated Chassis 
Management also includes the control functions of "Cruise control with braking function" and "Active 
Cruise Control with Stop & Go function" as well as "Collision warning with brake application function". 
Micro-mechanical sensors that supply signals for the drive dynamics systems are also incorporated 
into Integrated Chassis Management. 

Two different versions of the Integrated Chassis Management are used in the FI 0. A basic version for 
vehicles without ACC Stop & Go and a high-end version for vehicles with the optional ACC Stop & Go 
equipment (or for vehicles with active steering). 

The high-end version differs from the basic version in the following ways: 

• Larger microprocessor (needed for the calculations involved in Active Cruise Control) 

• Redundant sensors for lateral acceleration and yaw rate. 

The control unit has a 54-pin plug by which the power supply, sensors, actuators and bus systems are 
connected. Nor the controller housing or the plug connector are waterproof. This is not necessary as it 
is installed on the inside of the vehicle. 

The FlexRay is carried to the Integrated Chassis Management from the central gateway module and 
on from there to the Digital Motor Electronics. The Integrated Chassis Management is based on the 
FlexRay, therefore it is not an end node. This is why it does not have a terminating resistor for the 
FlexRay. 

Another bus system is connected to the Integrated Chassis Management in addition to the FlexRay. 
The Sensor CAN is used exclusively for communication between the Integrated Chassis Management 
and the ACC Stop & Go sensor. It transmits traffic condition information that has been detected by the 
sensor. 

The Sensor CAN operates with a transmission speed of 500 kBit/s. There are two terminal resistors for 
the Sensor CAN, each with 120 ohms. One of them is located in the Integrated Chassis Management, 
the second terminal resistor is integrated in the ACC sensor. 

The Integrated Chassis Management is installed in the center console behind the sensor for the Crash 
Safety Module. This means that the control unit and its integrated sensor system are ideally positioned 
(with regard to driving dynamics) near the vehicle's center of gravity. The mounting points on the 
body are precisely determined and are measured when the vehicle is manufactured and must not be 
replaced with any other mounting points.

9. ACC Stop & Go 

9.3. Obstacle/Vehicle Detection Process 

The ACC Stop & Go function requires information on other vehicles in front of the car. This is gained 
using the ACC sensor and processed in the Integrated Chassis Management. 

To do so, the electronics proceed as follows: 

• Object detection 

• Object-data processing 

• Object evaluation 


9.3.1. Object detection 

Detecting the presence of vehicles in front of the car is one of the most important functions of Active 
Cruise Control. The introduction of the Stop & Go function entails extending this functionality to 
include not only long-range detection but also short-range detection right through to the area directly 
in front of the car's front bumper. This is necessary, since the vehicle will travel very close to the vehicle 
in front of it, (see the "Distance control" section). The ACC Stop & Go sensor scans the short and 
long range ahead of the vehicle using radar waves. As well as detecting objects, the ACC sensor also 
determines the position of the objects in the x and y directions and computes their speed relative to 
our vehicle. The ACC sensor uses this relative-speed information to compute the acceleration of the 
objects relative to the car. These values are needed for distance control. 

9.3.2. Object-data processing 

Initial processing of the object data values for position and motion takes place right in the ACC sensor. 
Individual objects are grouped and tracked in time in order to bridge measurement gaps. The initial 
filtering of the object data also takes place at this stage. The second step of the process takes place in 
Integrated Chassis Management. There, the object data from the ACC sensor are combined, because 
the long-range and short-range fields overlap. This overlap mainly occurs in short-range detection. 

The combined object data are subjected to further filtration, which takes into account the special 
requirements for distance control. 

9.3.3. Object evaluation 

In order to decide which object is to be used for distance control, an evaluator value is calculated for 
each object. 

The following are the two most important criteria for this calculation: 

• Position and movement of the object relative to our vehicle. The closer the object is to our 
vehicle and/or the faster it is approaching, the higher the evaluator value. 

• Presence of the object in our lane. The radar sensors cannot detect the actual lane or the 
lane markings on the surface of the road. The information from the camera-based system 
installed for the Lane Departure Warning system is not yet available for ACC Stop & Go. 
Therefore, ACC Stop & Go computes a probable course for the lane ahead of the car. While 
the car is on the move, variables are used in this process that describe the motion of the car 
and the position of motionless objects detected by the sensors. If the car is at a standstill, 
computation is based primarily on analysis of the signal from the steering angle sensor. This

means that steering wheel movements while the car is at a standstill produce changes in the 
lane calculated by the ACC Stop & Go function and have a corresponding effect on evaluation 
of the detected objects. 

The object with the highest evaluator value is used for distance control. In this step in processing, 
the objects are also classified by their evaluation status. A distinction is drawn between moving 
and stationary objects. The control algorithm has a special way of treating objects which have been 
classified as stationary after first being detected. 


9.4. Control Functions 

9.4.1. Cruise control 

Cruise control in the ACC Stop & Go system works basically in the same way as in the DCC system. 

9.4.2. Distance control 

Distance control is the core function of the ACC Stop & Go system and is integrated into Integrated 
Chassis Management. Two buttons on the multifunction steering wheel enable the driver to select 
a desired distance from one of four stages. The ACC Stop & Go system uses this preselection to 
calculate the set-point distance to be used in control.

F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. ACC Stop & Go 

The set-point distance with the car on the move is proportional to driving speed (1). At low driving 
speeds and at a standstill, the proportional distance to the driving speed is no longer used for ACC 
Stop & Go, but instead a fixed value in metres (2). Distance control uses the processed data for the 
object with the highest evaluator value as its input variables. 

Distance control takes the following situations in particular into account: 

• Maximum values for acceleration and deceleration: 

The maximum values for acceleration and deceleration of the ACC Stop & Go system below 
approx. 50 km/h/31 mph are dynamic values. They correspond to the acceleration values 
which the driver personally would use and sense as comfortable. Depending on the situation, 

ACC Stop & Go accelerates at a maximum of up to approximately 2 m/s 2 and decelerates at 
maximum of up to approximately 4 m/s 2 . 

• Congested-traffic stability: 

In very tight traffic and at very low driving speeds, there is an increased risk of collisions from 
sharp acceleration and braking. Therefore the ACC Stop & Go distance controller is designed 
to decelerate as early as possible, but not more than the vehicle ahead. In following mode, 

the system can decelerate at a maximum of up to 2.5 m/s 2 , during a stopping procedure at a 
maximum of up to 4 m/s 2 . 


9.4.3. Cruise control in curves 

The ACC Stop & Go system's cruise control in curves is based on the counterpart function in Dynamic 
Cruise Control. The scope has been extended to include the lateral detection range of the sensor 
for ACC Stop & Go. If an object is lost in turning a curve, the system waits a while to see whether the 
object reappears (alternating curve). Acceleration begins only when it does not reappear. 

9.4.4. Prioritization of the set-points 

Set-point prioritization in the ACC Stop & Go system is basically the same as in the Dynamic Cruise 
Control system. The only major difference is the inclusion of an extra control set-point from the 
distance control function. 


9.4.5. Interference-force estimation 

Interference-force estimation as implemented in the ACC Stop & Go system is based on the 
counterpart function in Dynamic Cruise Control. However, a considerable degree of optimization is 
necessary, since inaccuracies in the interference-force estimation become much more perceptible 
in the low range of driving speeds (less than 30 km/h/20mph) than at higher driving speeds. 
Consequently, the estimation precision is better than that of the Dynamic Cruise Control system and 
the reaction to changes in interference forces is faster. 

9.4.6. Activation of the actuators 

Except for the situation that applies when the vehicle is at a standstill, the activation of the actuators in 
the ACC Stop & Go function is the same as that in Dynamic Cruise Control.

When ACC Stop & Go causes brake intervention, the brake lights are also activated. 


9.5. Operation and Display 


9.5.1. Activation and deactivation 

ACC Stop & Go and Dynamic Cruise Control are activated and deactivated in nearly the same way. 
The driver is able to activate ACC Stop & Go not only while the vehicle is in motion, but also when it 
is stationary, if the system has detected another vehicle ahead of it. To activate ACC Stop & Go at a 
standstill, the driver has to depress the brake pedal and simultaneously press the SET (if preset) or 
RES button. 

The following additional conditions must also be satisfied: 

• Seat belt buckled and door closed 

• Drive position “D” engaged 

• Engine running 

• Parking brake must not be activated 

• ACC Stop & Go Sensor operational 

• There must be no system fault present. 

If the status of Dynamic Stability Control beforehand was DTC or DSC Off, (in the FI 0) it switches 
on as soon as ACC Stop & Go is activated. If the vehicle was previously operated in sport+ mode, it 
automatically switches to sport mode. Dynamic Stability Control always switches automatically to 
its "Normal" status. If Dynamic Stability Control is set to DTC or DSC Off while ACC Stop & Go is 
operating, the ACC Stop & Go function is automatically deactivated. 

ACC Stop & Go cannot be deactivated by means of the ON/OFF button while the vehicle is stationary 
unless the brake pedal is depressed at the same time. 

The adjustment range for set speed in the F10 is 30 km/h to 180 km/h (20 mph to 115 mph). 
Compared to DCC, a vehicle with ACC Stop & Go has a keypad on the multifunction steering wheel 
that additionally features a rocker switch for making distance adjustments.

Briefly pressing the respective button to change the distance increases or decreases the desired 
distance used by ACC Stop & Go for its control process. A total of four increments are available to the 
driver. The selected distance stage is faded into the instrument panel. 

As with Dynamic Cruise Control, the display symbols for ACC Stop & Go are supplemented as needed 
by notes displayed in the instrument panel. The display symbols are, for example, the set speed and 
the distance bars. The status indicators are displayed for approx. 3 seconds. Each time the driver 
operates a control, the symbol reappears and remains visible for another 3 seconds. 

In addition, ACC Stop & Go information is displayed in the Head-Up Display. 

9.5.2. Changing the set speed 

When ACC Stop & Go is switched on, the driver can change the set speed in the same way as with 
the Dynamic Cruise Control system. This adjustment can be made even when the car is being held 
stationary by the ACC Stop & Go system. The adjustment range for set speed is 30 to 180 km/h (20 to 
115 mph). 

9.5.3. Changing the set distance 

The desired distance can be changed by briefly pressing the corresponding button on the 
multifunction steering wheel with the system switched on. The driver has the usual choice of four 
distance stages, symbolized by bars in the instrument panel. Changing the set distance while the car 
is on the move immediately produces a perceptible reaction by the vehicle. The car accelerates or 
decelerates slightly to take up the new set distance. Making this change while at a standstill does not 
set the car in motion. 

If the driver overrides ACC Stop & Go, the desired distance cannot be changed. When the driver 
overrides the system, the distance bars in the instrument panel disappear. 

9.5.4. Stopping and pulling away 

Even though the "distance control" function works in principle right down to a speed of zero (complete 
standstill), the system incorporates additional software functions that control the stopping and pulling 
away procedures. It is their job to control the drivetrain and the brakes in such a way that the driver 
and other vehicle occupants perceive driving as a thoroughly comfortable and enjoyable experience. 

In addition, it would be unacceptable for the vehicle to be permitted to roll backward during these 
processes. 


49 







F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. ACC Stop & Go 

In order to meet these requirements, drivetrain and brakes are actuated simultaneously and under 
precision control in the processes of stopping and pulling away. This is very much the same as what 
the driver does when using the parking brake and the accelerator pedal to pull away on an uphill 
gradient without allowing the car to roll backward. 

Under extreme external circumstances, for example on a particularly steep uphill gradient, ACC Stop 
& Go might not be able to set the car in motion. If this happens the braking pressure necessary to 
hold the car stationary is applied and the system remains in this state until the driver switches it off 
or assumes full manual control for pulling away. This is not a fault; instead, it represents a situation in 
which the limits defining the operating range of ACC Stop & Go have been exceeded. 

The maximum level of support and assistance that a Stop & Go system could offer the driver would 
be the ability to undertake all actions from stopping through to pulling away in fully automatic mode. 
The technical implementation of this is a function that automatically brings the car to a complete stop, 
but automatically drives off only if the vehicle remains motionless briefly. If the car is at a standstill for 
longer than a few seconds, ACC Stop & Go does not attempt automatic pulling away. Instead, ACC 
Stop & Go sends the driver a signal in the instrument panel that it has recognized a drive off situation, 
but will not set the car in motion unless the driver confirms this signal by operating a control. 

This acknowledgement of the drive-off prompt ensures that the driver is fully aware of the traffic 
situation even after a prolonged stop in traffic. Because even with ACC and the Stop & Go function, the 
driver remains fully and solely responsible for control of the vehicle and the use of the assistance and 
support functions at his or her disposal. 

ACC Stop & Go uses standstill management, a function of Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) for longer 
stops. Standstill management incorporates a rolling detection function. Rolling detection ensures 
that the braking pressure needed to keep the vehicle stationary is increased when necessary (if 
any unintentional movement is detected by the vehicle). Standstill management also monitors the 
stopping procedure and is aware of ABS action (if it is used in bring the car to a stop). In this case, a 
slip detector is activated while the vehicle is at a standstill to reduce the pressure at an individual wheel 
brake. If a wheel at which brake pressure has been reduced starts to turn, standstill management 
identifies the car is sliding and the ACC Stop & Go is switched off, brake pressure is relieved at all 
wheel brakes and the driver is notified by a Check Control message. Relieving the brake pressure at 
all four wheels turns a slide into a situation in which the car is again steerable. Of course, the driver 
can still decelerate the vehicle back to a standstill by depressing the brake pedal, if the road conditions 
permit. 

9.5.5. Behavior in response to driver's intention to exit the vehicle 

ACC Stop & Go uses the DSC hydraulics to slow the vehicle reliably to a halt and keep it stationary. 
Without a supply of electricity, the DSC hydraulics are, however, unable to indefinitely maintain the 
braking force necessary to keep the vehicle stationary. The FI 0 is equipped with an electronic parking 
brake (EMF). 

The EMF is capable of holding the vehicle stationary in the following situations: 

• in certain failure events of the Dynamic Stability Control, 

• if the driver gets out or 

• the engine is switched off. 

The ability of the electronic parking brake to hold the vehicle is a comfort enhancement for situations 
in which the vehicle is at a standstill. In the FI 0, the lock function of the electronic parking brake is 
activated automatically whenever the driver is about to exit the vehicle with ACC Stop & Go still active. 


50 



F10 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. ACC Stop & Go 

The driver's intention to exit the vehicle is detected by the signals of the seat belt buckle contact 
(driver's side) and door contact (driver's door). A signal from the seat occupancy detector (driver's 
seat) is not used in the FI 0 for this function. 

While the vehicle is being held stationary by ACC Stop & Go, the DSC unit takes over all monitoring 
and control processes. The DSC also controls the system's behavior in response to the driver's 
intention to exit the vehicle. For ACC Stop & Go, this is very similar to that implemented for the DSC- 
internal Automatic Hold function. 

ACC Stop & Go is deactivated automatically if, from the bus signals it receives, it detects that the 
parking brake function has been activated. Now the vehicle is still held stationary but by the parking 
brake function instead. 


9.6. Monitoring Functions 

Integrated Chassis Management monitors the system network to verify that all participating sub¬ 
systems are operational, all input signals required for operation are valid, and the electronics of the 
native control unit are in full working order. When troubleshooting this system, it is important to include 
all participating systems in the system network and not just the individual components. If a fault 
occurs, the function is shut down completely. A status indicator in the instrument panel and a Check 
Control message notify the driver that the system is not available. Reactivation is not possible until the 
fault is no longer present.

10. Collision Warning w/Brake Application 

With the optional ACC Stop & Go equipment (option 5DF) in the FI 0, the customer automatically 
receives the collision warning with brake application function. It shares the sensor system and system 
components with ACC Stop & Go. 


10.1. Operation 

The collision warning with brake application function is switched on or off with the driver assistance 
system control panel. 

Upon switching on the function, a display opens in the central information display. Here the driver can 
configure the time of the advance warning in two stages, or deactivate/reactivate the advance warning. 
The setting selected by the driver is maintained on a key-specific basis via a terminal change.

10.2. Functional Principle 

The system warns of a possible danger of collision in two stages at speeds of approx. 15 km/h/1 Omph 
or higher. 

The collision warning is also available when the cruise control is deactivated. 

Stationary or moving objects are taken into consideration only if they are in the detection range of the 
sensor for ACC Stop & Go. 

If you purposely approach an object, the collision warning comes later to avoid unwarranted warnings. 


10.3. Warning Function 

The warning function is divided into two stages. It is displayed in the instrument panel and, if 
equipped, in the Head-Up Display.

10.3.1. Advance Warning 

The advance warning comes e.g. if there is an apparent danger of collision or if there is very little 
distance to the vehicle driving in front. 

The advance warning is signalled by a red-lit vehicle in the instrument panel and, if equipped, in the 
Head-Up Display. 

10.3.2. Acute Warning with Brake Application Function 

The acute warning comes if there is an imminent danger of collision, whenever the vehicle approaches 
another object with a relatively high speed difference. 

If there is an acute warning, the driver is shown a red flashing vehicle in the instrument panel and, 
if present, in the Head-Up Display. Additionally, an audible warning signal sounds. The driver is 
prompted to brake and, where appropriate, to take evasive action. 

The acute warning prompts you to intervene and, if there is a danger of collision, usually assists with 
brake intervention. 

The brake intervention has a maximum brake force of 3 m/s 2 and is only for a limited time. Brake 
intervention occurs only in the case of detected objects that are moving or have stopped. In the case 
of objects that were already still when they entered the detection range of the sensor, there is no 
braking. 

The system cannot brake the vehicle to a standstill. 

Brake intervention occurs only if the Dynamic Stability Control is switched on.

Note: The acute warning does not relieve the driver of the responsibility for adjusting the speed and 
driving style to the traffic conditions.

10. Collision Warning w/Brake Application 

The brake intervention can be cancelled by depressing the accelerator pedal or by an active steering 
wheel movement. 

When towing or being towed, switch off the collision warning with braking function in order to avoid 
malfunctions. 

The brake application function is deactivated if the Dynamic Stability Control DSC or Dynamic Traction 
Control DTC is deactivated.

Due to system limitations, it can happen that warnings are issued without cause, too late or not at all. 
For safety reasons, you must be attentive in order to be able to take action at any time.
