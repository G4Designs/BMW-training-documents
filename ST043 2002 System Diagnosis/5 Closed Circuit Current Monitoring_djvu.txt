Closed Circuit Current Monitoring 




























Inputs 


Terminal 30 

The battery positive terminal is connected directly to the load input of the Power Module. 

Battery Switch 

The battery switch (BS) offers the vehicle owner and the service department the choice 
between the settings ON ("closed circuit current monitoring") and OFF ("storage mode"). It 
is located above the PM on the right hand side of the luggage compartment. 


ON OFF 



Interior Lighting Button 

This controls the interior lighting and is located on the front interior lighting unit. The possi¬ 
ble settings are "Automatic control", "On", "Off" and “Workshop mode” (hold for 3 sec¬ 
onds). 

Exterior Trunk Lid Release Button (TOEHK) 

This button is a direct input to the Power Module. The trunk lid is released by means of the 
button on the outside of the trunk lid. 

Trunk Lock Actuator Switch 

The switch in the trunk lock actuator is used to inform the Power Module as to the position 
of the lock actuator and to synchronize the SCA. it also controls the luggage compartment 
lighting, the monitoring of the alarm system and the trunk lid warning light. 

SCA Contact 

This input is used to signal the PM that the SCA has rotated 180° (used to switch off the 
electric motor). 

15_w (wake-up) 

This is a redundant signal from the Car Access System which wakes up the Power Module. 

Battery Temperature Sensor 

Measures the temperature directly on the battery negative terminal. This information is used 
for the "optimum charging" function. The measuring range is -25°C to +75°C. 

K-CAN Periphery 

Enables communication with the vehicle network.

Outputs Connected to Electronic Battery Master Switch 
Terminal 30U 

Supplies the fuse box in the luggage compartment. 

Terminal 30B 

Supplies the fuse box in the glove compartment. 



Outputs Not Connected to Electronic Battery Master Switch 

The following outputs are supplied by the PM separately from the Electronic Battery Master 
Switch. 


• Rear window heater (HHS) 

• Light Module (LM) 

• Car Access System (CAS) 

• DME 

• Alarm system (DWA) 

• Emergency power siren (SINE) 

• Cigarette lighter (ZIG) 


• Electrochromatic mirrors (EC) 

• Park Distance Control (PDC) 

• Rain/light sensor (RLS) 

• Interior lighting (IB) 

• Central locking trunk lid drive (ZV) 

• Central locking, fuel filler flap (ZV) 

• Trunk lid Soft Close Motor (SCA) 


The advantages of this arrangement are: 

• The exterior lighting can remain on (for safety reasons) even if the Electronic Battery Mas¬ 
ter switch is off. 

• The alarm system is always armed. 

• No additional fuses and wiring for actuators in nearby locations. 


9 

Closed Circuit Current Monitoring 



Fuses 

The outputs for the rear window heater, KL R and KL 15, are not protected by convention¬ 
al fuses. They are supplied via a power transistor (MOS-FET) in the Power Module. 

By measuring the current and comparing it with stored threshold levels, the Power Module 
can detect a short circuit and disconnect the circuit if needed. The outputs for CAS, DWA 
and DME are protected by internal electronic fuses. 

Shut Down Protocol 

Shut-Down of Consumer Circuits (Sleep mode) 

To prevent battery discharge by consumer items mistakingly left on, the interior lighting cir¬ 
cuit (IB) and consumer circuits-roof zone (VA-D) are shut off 16 minutes after KL R is 
switched off. 

The consumer circuit-body (VA-K) remains on longer for the cigarette lighter relay, glovebox 
lighting, luggage compartment light and the telephone (recharging if plugged in). The VA-K 
is shut off 60 minutes after KL R is switched off. 

Shut-Down of Auxiliary Consumers 

In order to ensure that the car is capable of starting, the charge level (SoC-State of Charge) 
of the battery is monitored when the vehicle is at rest. The minimum battery SoC required 
to ensure that the car can be started again is a calculated value. 

The calculation takes into account the: 

• Battery temperature measured over last few days 

• Engine type 

• Capacity of the battery fitted (110Ah for the 745i). 

The SoC calculation is displayed as a percentage of battery capacity (a fully charged bat¬ 
tery is considered 80%). If the charge level of the battery gets close to that calculated min¬ 
imum level as a result of the operation of an auxiliary consumer unit, the Power Module 
instructs that circuit to switch off. 

Auxiliary consumer circuits are items such as the Control Display, DWA, LM, EGS and IHKA 
(rest function). There are two modes of operation when shutting down auxiliary consumer 
circuits: auxiliary consumers with KL R “ON” and auxiliary consumer with ignition off (KL 0). 


10 

Closed Circuit Current Monitoring 



Closed-Circuit Current Monitoring - Normal Sleep Mode 


• When the ignition is switched “OFF” (KL 0), the Busses go to sleep in 2 minutes. 

• After 16 minutes, the Power Module sends a signal for the consumer circuits-roof zone 
(VA-D) shut-down and briefly wakes the Busses. 

• VA-D is switched off and the Busses resume sleep mode. 

• After 60 minutes, the consumer circuit-body (VA-K) is switched off. 


The Power Module now assumes closed-circuit current monitoring mode: 

• Cyclic voltage measurement every 5 seconds, cyclic current measurement every 60 sec¬ 
onds. 

Note: If an operation is performed on the vehicle before 60 minutes has elapsed (central 
locking, trunk opened), the timer starts again from the beginning. 

• Once the 60 minute period has ended, the closed-circuit current is approximately 30 mA 
(max. 50 mA). 

• If the closed-circuit current exceeds 80 mA, the Power Module will monitor a 5 minute 
“waiting period” allowing the vehicle an opportunity to resume the normal 30 mA closed- 
circuit current. 

• If the excessive current remains after the 5 minute waiting period, a fault code with the 
current value is stored. The Power Module issues the "Shutdown Counter" message and 
after 90 seconds, the vehicle's electrical system is shut down (briefly isolated) by the 
Electronic Battery Master Switch. 

A second attempt is made and if excessive current draw is still present, the Shutdown 
Counter functions again after 90 seconds to isolate the electrical system. 

The Electronic Battery Master Switch is reconnected under the following conditions: 

• Change ignition from “OFF” to KL R or KL 15 

• Toggling of the Battery Switch (switching back and forth twice within 2 seconds) 

• KL 15 wake-up line (from CAS) 

• External charge detection (> 13.2 V at the Power Module) 

• CAN message relating to activated, legally required electric loads (hazard warning lights)

MOM 




Closed-circuit current monitoring is automatically cancelled by a message from the Lamp 
Module that the hazard warning lights are active. 

When KL R is switched off, current monitoring is also immediately activated. Normal cur¬ 
rent load on the vehicle drops in stages according to the vehicle programming for sleep 
mode (see chart on the following page). 

If the monitored current is > 120 amps (even as a random spike) , the interior lighting, roof 
area consumers and body zone consumer circuits are immediately switched off. 


Reasons for Electronic Battery Master Switch Disconnection 

The reason for battery disconnection is stored together with the fault code in the Power 
Module fault memory. Several examples that may be stored are: 

• The battery was disconnected because a current > 120 Amps was measured after 
switching off KL R. 

Note: The current threshold was increased from 35 Amps to 120 Amps because all four 
power window motors can be operated simultaneously up to the end stop. 

• The battery was disconnected because an excessively high vehicle closed-circuit current 
was measured. 

• The battery was disconnected after a 3 week parking period. 

• The battery was disconnected by activation of Storage Mode with the Battery Switch. 

• The battery was disconnected because the battery capacity (SoC) dropped below the 
start limit with KL R switched on and KL 15 switched off. 

• The battery was disconnected because a short-circuit in KL 30 was detected. 

• The battery was disconnected by a DISplus/GTI diagnostic command.

Before disconnecting, the PM sends out the "Shutdown" signal. After a further 90 seconds 
the shut down is completed. If the ignition switch is turned to KL R or KL15, a Check 
Control message is issued which informs the driver that the vehicle is in Storage Mode. 

The following CC message appears:

When the signal “15w” or change-over of the battery switch to "closed-circuit current mon¬ 
itoring" is detected, the Electronic Battery Master Switch is closed. 

The vehicle can still be started and driven in storage mode. All systems remain functional. 
The CC message remains active. 

When KL R “Off" is active, disconnection is carried out after 30 minutes (as explained 
above). 

Note: If the battery switch is detected as defective, closed-circuit current monitoring will be 
activated. 

If no function of any kind is activated over a period of 3 weeks, the battery is disconnected 
from the vehicle's electrical system to prevent battery discharge. This function is indepen¬ 
dent of the position of the battery switch. 


Electronic Fuse 

If a short circuit current of over 250 A is detected, the Electronic Battery Master Switch is 
opened. When the wake-up signal “15w” from the CAS is detected, then an attempt is 
made to close the Electronic Battery Master Switch again. 

This procedure is repeated continually until the short circuit has been eliminated.

Workshop Hints 

Closed Circuit Current Monitoring For The E65/E66 Electrical System 

In the event that an E65/E66 vehicle has a battery draw and/or the Power Module has faults 
stored in memory relative to closed circuit current monitoring, the following is provided to 
assist you in diagnosis. 

Increased closed-circuit currents may occur permanently or occur intermittently, and cause 
the battery to discharge prematurely. The increase in closed circuit current may be caused 
by a faulty control module, or by the installation of a non-approved accessory. 

In a situation where a vehicle has compalints due to a discharged battery, for diagnostic 
purposes it is important not to disconnect the battery. This is because a control module will 
be reset if the battery is disconnected. Following a reset, the faulty control module may start 
functioning correctly again, making accurate diagnosis impossible. 

To correctly measure closed-circuit current, measurement adapter Special Tool P/N 90 88 
6 612 300 should be used. This tool provides a bridge to ground, before the negative bat¬ 
tery terminal is disconnected, and this prevents the control modules from being reset. 

The additional use of MoDiC adapter Special Tool P/N 90 88 6 612 310 provides a method 
for current measurements over an extended period of time. 

This procedure should be followed after you have reviewed the Power Module “Principle of 
Operation” in the beginning of this module. 


Tools Required: 

• 50 amp inductive probe for DISplus or MFK1 
for the MoDIC/GTI. 

• BMW closed circuit current measuring tool 
# 61 2 300 (4. in diagram). 

• Digital Multimeter capable of measuring up to 
15 Amps. 

• MoDIC adapter #61 2 310 for recording 
draws up to 72 hours (3. in diagram). 



16 

Closed Ciroiut Current Monitoring 




Preconditions: 

• First, read and understand SIB # 61 08 00 

• Charge the vehicle battery with a BMW recommended (Deutronic) battery charger to 
obtain a minimum of 12.6 Volts. The battery charger must be disconnected prior to any 
draw testing. 

• Vehicle charging system must be operating correctly. 

• Ceck for faults and correct any faults that are present. 

• Have a copy of the bus chart ready for reference. Understand the basics in order to 
“Divide and Conquer” the bus network. 

• Review the power supply wiring diagram to understand the three (3) separate routes that 
the B+ potential can travel. The B+ lead that feeds the IVM/ECM, starter and generator. 
This lead has a junction in the luggage compartment and supplies the aluminum ribbon 
cable to the front of the vehicle. 

The second is the feed from the Power Module 30 B to the front fuse panel in the glove 
box. Moving the current probe to each individual cable will isolate which circuit has the 
current draw(s). 

• Review the Vehicle Sleep Mode shut down protocol chart (page 13) to assist with com¬ 
parisons when diagnosing a faulted vehicle. 


Please Review the Following General Observations: 

1. After swithcing the ignition “OFF”, the CAS light remains “ON” for approximately 2 min¬ 
utes. When the CAS LED goes out, this indicates that the Bus network is sleeping. At 
this time the current measurement should not be > 800 mA (.8 A). 

2. After approximately 16 minutes the CAS led illuminates for approximately 30 seconds 
(Bus network is awake). After the CAS LED goes out (Bus network is sleeping), the BZM 
seat switch lights (left and right) will turn off. At this time the Power Module circuit VA-D 
roof consumers shut down (hint - leave a map light on as a visual). The current draw is 
approximately 200 mA (.2 A) at this time. 

3. The remaining time until the vehicle is in “sleep mode” will occur in approximately 44 
minutes (vehicle dependent). The total time for sleep mode could take up to 70 min¬ 
utes. 


17 

Closed Ciroiut Current Monitoring 



4. The final closed circuit current draw should be approximately 30 mA (.030 A) or less 
(normal peaks last for approx. 20 seconds each). These normal peaks are a result of the 
Instrument Cluster performimg a temperature status check (deminishes in frequency as 
time goes on). 

5. Always allow the vehicle to go into the sleep mode naturally. Do not use the DISplus/GT 1 
test module to expedite shut down on the initial diagnosis. This test module can be used 
after the conformation of failure has occurred and additional testing is required. This will 
help in speeding up the subsequent diagnosis. 

Closed Circuit Current Monitoring Procedure: 

The following instructions can be supplemented with the HI document in DIS under Power 
supply Diagnostic Test Plan, entitled "Procedure in event of closed circuit current faults”. 
There are examples of closed-circuit current violations with additional diagnostic hints. 

1. With the DISplus/GTI, interrogate all control modules with a short test. Correct all faults 
before proceding with closed circuit diagnosis. This includes reviewing diagnostic 
queries for the Power Module to analyze reasons for battery disconnects, battery SOC, 
battery history and basic charging operation. 

2. Disconnect battery charger from the vehicle (remove clamps). 

3. Open the trunk lid and secure the latch mechanism (as if the trunk lid was closed). 

4. Open hood and lift up on the hood pin switch (service position). 

5. To prepare for fuse access, open the glove box door and disable the glovebox light. This 
will avoid awakening the Power Module later. 

6. Hook up current monitoring tools following this progression: 

If using the DISpius: 

- 50 amp inductive clamp around the B- cable from the battery to chassis ground. 
Access the BMW Test system “Multimeter screen" , and select the “Current 50A” set¬ 
ting and “MIN/MAX”. 

Prefered - MoDIC/GTI (when function is available on GT1) 

- 50 amp inductive clamp around the B- cable from the battery to chassis ground. 

- MFK1 connected to Special Tools #61 2 300 and #61 2 310 (as shown on page 16). 
Follow MoDIC setup instructions per SIB # 61 08 00 (do not plug into MoDIC yet, just 
have connections ready), do not disconnect the chassis ground at this time. This tool 
can only handle a current of 10 amps or less and will fail until the vehicle current is 
safely below this value. 


18 

Closed Ciroiut Current Monitoring 



7. Shut off ignition “KL 0”, remove the remote key from vehicle. Open both front doors and 
secure rotatory latch (as if the doors were closed), Use a suitable tool and not your fin¬ 
ger! Be careful not to catch your fingers in the latch, the vehicle may be equipped with 
Soft Close Automatic (SCA). Activate the remote locking “twice” (to disable the FIS sen¬ 
sor) and begin to watch for Bus power down. 

8. After the CAS LED goes out (approx. 2 minutes), the current draw should not be > 800 
mA. The BZM lights will remain on. 

9. After approximately 16 minutes, the CAS LED will illuminate. The current draw will spike 
to approximately 8 - 9 A for 30 seconds. Then the CAS and BZM lights go out and the 
current draw will be approximately 200 mA for 60 -70 minutes. Unplug the 50 amp 

clamp lead from the MoDIC and plug in the MFK1 lead, it is now safe to remove the 
chassis ground and the draw trace will begin if the MoDIC/GTI is used. 

At the 60 -70 minute point (sleep mode), if the closed-circuit current draw is > 30 mA, 
normal procedures of pulling fuses and disconnecting components will be necessary (as 
outlined below). Remember to divide and conquer the circuits with the help of the ETM. 

If the closed-circuit current draw remains higher than 30 mA after 60 minutes or never 

drops down to less than 30 mA proceed as follows (the MoDIC/GTI- when function is avail¬ 
able on GT1, must be used at this point to establish a draw trace): 

10. Remove Fuse 5 from the front fuse box behind the glove compartment (Fuse 5 also 
powers the BZM, the seat switch lights will go out). Wait 2 minutes (allows CAS to reset) 
and recheck draw. 

If draw drops down to below 30 ma reinstall Fuse 5 and disconnect 1 MOST bus con¬ 
sumer at a time (Control Display last - it is the gateway) and install optic jumper (made 
from parts, available in EPC) wait 2 minutes between each disconnection (allows CAS 
to reset). 

11. If draw is still present after Fuse 5 removal, remove Fuse 15 to ZGM from front fuse 
box, this isolates the Byteflight Bus from PT-CAN Bus. 

If draw drops down, then disconnect SIM module behind glove box and reinstall Fuse 
15. If draw drops after SIM removal then draw is from Byteflight and isolate which Byte- 
flight module is causing draw. If draw does not drop after SIM removal, the draw is com¬ 
ing from PT-CAN bus. Disconnect each PT-CAN Bus module until draw is gone. 

12. If removing Fuse 5 and or Fuse 15 do not drop draw below 30 mA, then draw is from 
K-CAN S and or K-CAN P modules. Disconnect one CAN consumer at a time until 
draw is gone. 

Note: Please refer to Bus Chart on page 20.

Closed Circiut Current Monitoring 



Sleep Mode with PT-CAN Bus Consumer (example) 

When the closed-circuit current draw remains higher than 30 mA after 60 minutes or never 
drops down < 30 mA, the MoDIC/GTI (when function is available on GT1) used at this point 
establishes a draw trace. 

In this example, a consumer stays awake after the 60 -70 minutes. From the peaks you can 
observe that the closed-circuit current draw is not normal. 



By removing Fuse #15 to ZGM (in front fuse box), the Byteflight and PT-CAN Bus circuits 
are isolated and the closed-circuit current draw decreases to a normal value. 

After disconnecting SIM module and reinstalling fuse #15, the draw still exists indicating 
that it is from PT-CAN bus. 

By disconnecting each PT-CAN Bus module (one at a time), the draw decreased after the 
Electro-mechanical Parking Brake Control Module (EMF) was unplugged. This component 
was staying awake and in addition, awoke the entire Bus network.

Closed Ciroiut Current Monitoring 



































Diagnosing the Power Module with the DISplus/GTI 

After the initial power down protocol in which the vehicle enters “sleep mode” naturally and 
excessive closed-circuit current draws are present, the DISplus/GTI can be used to expe¬ 
dite sleep mode for further diagnosis. 

This procedure is found under: 

Service Functions - Body - 
Voltage and current monitoring. 

• Select <Activate sleep mode>, 

<Power down command> and 
<Test Plan>. 


• Highlight the Test Module and 
press the green <Arrow> to the 
right. 


The following preconditions must 
be followed for a successful 
Power Down: 

• DISplus/GTI connected 


• Battery Switch set to “ON” 

• KLR “OFF”, but vehicle must not have 
gone to sleep yet 

• Remove key 


• Battery voltage must be at least 12.5 V 
and battery charger must be disconnect¬ 
ed from vehicle 

• This screen prompts you to 
select <Yes> to send the Power 
Down command.

Closed Ciroiut Current Monitoring 





The inputs/outputs that are part of the Power Module can be diagnosed by Test Modules 
or status check by the Control Unit Functions of the Diagnosis Program. The outputs can 
be activated by Component Activation and the power consumption displayed. 

All electronic fuses and the Electronic Battery Master Switch are monitored for short cir¬ 
cuits/circuit breaks. In the event of a fault, an entry is made in the Power Module fault mem¬ 
ory and if appropriate, a Check Control message is initiated. 

The “Status” of the Power Module and monitored circuits/components can prove to be very 
helpful in diagnosing faults and provide an overall state of vehicle “electrical power man¬ 
agement”. 

• From the DISplus/GTI main menu (after a short test was completed), select <Control unit 
functions>. 

• Select <Power Module> and highlight Part Functions of the status to be displayed. 


Some Power Module status 
examples to consider are: 


• Number of battery disconnections 


• Closed-circuit current counter 

• Temperature 


• Wake terminal 15 

• Battery switch, switch contact 2 

• Battery switch, switch contact 1

• By selecting <Alternator>, this 
will display the charging output 
that the Power Module desires 
and receives from the Alter¬ 
nator. 


The Power Module regulates the 
charge level to the battery based 
on: 

Optimum Charging 

The battery voltage can fluctuate between 14.0 V and 15.5 V. The optimum charge voltage 
is set according to the charge level of the battery, the battery temperature and the status 
of the external lights (higher charging voltage with lights off). The maximum setting is 16 V. 

Temperature-Dependent Battery Charging Voltage 

By using a charging characteristic map stored in the Power Module, the charge voltage of 
the alternator is adjusted according to the battery temperature. 

The Power Module detects the temperature of the battery and places the instruction 
"Increase charge voltage" on the K-CAN Periphery. The CAS passes the message on to the 
K-CAN System bus. The ZGM receives the message. Performing its function as a "gateway 
control unit", it passes the message on to the PT-CAN. The ECM module receives the 
request to increase the charge voltage over the PT-CAN. 

The alternator then receives the request to increase the charge voltage via the BSD lead 
(Bit Serial Data interface). The electronic evaluation unit in the alternator then adjusts the 
charge voltage accordingly. If the temperature sensor is defective then the charging voltage 
will be fixed at 14.3 V. 

Increasing Idle Speed to Improve Battery Charging 

In order to drain as little energy as possible from the battery during freezing weather (below 
34°F) the engine idle speed may be increased. 

This ensures that the battery charge level is kept high. If the charge level falls below the cal¬ 
culated minimum level for starting, the engine idle speed is increased to 750 rpm. 

The calculation of the minimum level for starting takes in account the temperature and the 
condition/age of the battery.

• By selecting <Battery>, this 
will display the battery “state of 
health” according to the Power 
Module’s calculation. 


The relationship of charge vs: dis¬ 
charge can be seen here. This is 
helpful for determining a sulfated 
battery. 


Battery Charge Level Detection 

The Power Module knows what the charge level of the battery is at any time by calculating 
the battery current when the vehicle is being driven and measuring the discharge current. 

When the vehicle is not in use, the charge level is re-calculated and updated by measuring 
the closed circuit battery voltage. If the vehicle battery is replaced it must be registered with 
the Power Module so that the stored values can be deleted and a new calculation started. 

Central Battery Voltage Notification 

The Power Module continuously measures the battery voltage. This information is made 
available to all other control units via the Bus link. This can be used, for example, to enable 
continuous running of the sliding/tilting sunroof regardless of battery voltage. 

Central battery voltage notification eliminates the need for individual measurement of bat¬ 
tery voltage by each control module. 

Data Memory 

The Power Module data memory stores electrical system activity (data) relevant to the vehi¬ 
cle. That information provides a status read-out of the battery load and life. The data mem¬ 
ory will be used in future to obtain a load profile of the battery in normal operation that will 
be analyzed for Condition Based Service. 

Battery Temperature Sensor 

In the event of a defective sensor, a short circuit or an implausible value, the substitute value 
of 20 °C is assumed. This corresponds to a fixed charge voltage of 14.3 V at the battery. 

Battery capacity (SoC) is calculated using the substitute value.

• By selecting <Battery statistic^ 

this will display the time the bat¬ 
tery has spent in what “state of 
charge” according to the Power 
Module’s calculation. 


The Power Module determines 
the battery state of charge (SoC) 
and the time in the SoC range 
which is required for: 


To ensure that the car is capable of starting, the charge level (SoC) of the battery is moni¬ 
tored when the vehicle is at rest. 

The minimum battery SoC required to ensure that the car can be started again is a calcu¬ 
lated value. 

The calculation takes into account the: 

• Battery temperature measured over last few days 

• Engine type 

• Capacity of the battery fitted (110Ah for the 745i). 

The SoC calculation is displayed as a percentage of battery capacity (A fully charged bat¬ 
tery is considered 80%). 

If the charge level of the battery gets close to that calculated minimum level as a result of 
the operation of an auxiliary consumer, the Power Module instructs that circuit to switch off.

Battery Replacement Registration (Must be performed when a battery is replaced) 

This Service Function informs the Power Module that the battery has been replaced. It 
completes the following operations: 

• Battery capacity is set to a value that is dependent on seasonal temperature. 

• The current odometer reading is stored. 

• Previously stored battery statistics (current, voltage, battery charge level) are deleted. 

• Previously stored temperature statistics are deleted. 


29 

Closed Ciroiut Current Monitoring 




When the "Register battery replacement" is requested, the state of charge (SoC) of the bat¬ 
tery is not set to 80%, but to a value that is dependent on the seasonal temperature. 

The seasonal temperature is an averaged time based value (over the last few days) for the 
battery SoC that is required for a successful starting procedure. 

The battery SoC value is set 28% above the SoC calculated from the seasonal tempera¬ 
ture. The following examples for the SoC after battery replacement are: 


Seasonal Temperature SoC Value 

-25 °C 98% 

-10°C 68% 

0 °C 66% 

10 °C 63% 

20 °C 61% 

30 °C 58% 


The SoC is maintained at these values until the ignition is switched “OFF” for > 2 hours. The 
SoC is redetermined during the closed-circuit voltage measurement (conducted after 2 
hours) and then calculated based on the battery current. 

Note: Central Locking, door changes (open/closed) and interior light status changes must 
not occur during this time because the timer will restart.
