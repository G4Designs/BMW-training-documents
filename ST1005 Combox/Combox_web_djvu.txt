Combox 

3. System Components 

3.1. Combox 

The Combox control unit is located in a housing that has been designed for installation without a hold¬ 
er. Thus in certain vehicles, the Combox is installed without an additional sheet metal holder. 

In the event of a collision, however, the impact energy is transmitted directly to the control unit when 
there is no sheet metal holder. Therefore the Combox control unit must be checked for external dam¬ 
age after the vehicle has been in a collision. 



3.1.1. Versions 

Although the Combox is only available in combination with the BMW Assist (option 639), different ver¬ 
sions of the control unit are used depending on the vehicle's electrical system and optional equipment. 

Therefore, there are currently four versions of the Combox: 

Vehicle electrical system BN2000 (L2 [E8x, E9x] and L4 [E7x] as of 09/2010) 

• Combox with telematics (With BMW Assist) 

• Combox with telematics and GPS receiver (With BMW Assist and Navigation) 

Vehicle electrical system BN2020 (L6 [FOx] as of 09/2010) 

• Combox with telematics (With BMW Assist) 

• Combox with telematics and GPS receiver (With BMW Assist and Navigation) 


3.1.2. Interfaces and components 

To make it easier to tell them apart, the system connector is white for the vehicle electrical system 
BN2020 and black for the vehicle electrical system BN2000. The Combox is connected in the L2 
and L4 to the K-CAN and in the L6 to the K-CAN2. Because the K-CAN and K-CAN2 have different 
speeds, the color-coding was implemented to prevent them from being mixed up.

3.1.3. Use of the Combox in L2 vehicles as of 09/2010 

The following optional equipment is available in conjunction with the Combox in the L2 vehicles: 

• Radio Professional (option 663) 

• BMW Assist with Bluetooth (option 639) 

• iPod and USB adapter (option 6FL) 

• Smartphone Integration (option 6NF) 

• Navigation system (option 609) 


As of 09/2010, the ULF-SBX High and TCU control units will be replaced by the Combox. 

Currently, to get Bluetooth and USB audio interface functions we must order BMW Assist with Blue¬ 
tooth (option 639), which includes the Combox controller. (See the table below) 

A_ 

BMW Assist (SA639) is currently standard equipment only on the X5 M, X6 M, 5, 6 & 7 Series. 
It is part of the Premium Package on all other models as of 9/2010.

3.1.4. Use in L4 and L6 

A Combox is installed in L4 and L6 vehicles in combination with one of the following optional equip¬ 
ment packages: 

• BMW Assist w/Bluetooth option 639) 

• USB audio interface (option 6FL) 


3.2. Bluetooth devices 

Cell phones and audio players can be connected to the Combox via Bluetooth. The range and diversity 
of cell phones available on the market is steadily increasing. Not every Bluetooth-enabled cell phone is 
automatically compatible with every hands-free system. To provide the customer with a simpler, easy- 
to-understand overview of the currently “tested” devices, the website at http://www.bmwusa.com/ 
bluetooth is being constantly updated. Customers are able to use the website to determine which de¬ 
vices and functions work and which do not with their specific BMW model. 

The customer can now obtain information regarding the compatibility of specific tested cell phones 
with their vehicles (by entering the vehicle VIN number for example). A prospective BMW customer can 
also find out which cell phones have been tested and are compatible with specific BMW models.

Combox 

3. System Components 

3.3. iPhone charging 

In some circumstances the current audio Y-cable [which is supplied with cars equipped with a USB/ 
Audio interface (SA 6FL)] will not charge an iPhone 4 or 3GS sufficiently. A new charging adapter # 

61 12 2 167 663 was developed to use in conjunction with the existing audio Y-cable. The charging 
adapter is connected in series with the audio Y-cable or the original Apple USB cable (in Combox vehi¬ 
cles). 

This charging adapter is required due to the fact that the USB port only supports charging at a rate of 
5V @ 500mA which is lower than many newer iPhones require (especially under heavy use). 

The new charging adapter charging circuit is supplied through the 12V cigarette lighter and it insures 
an output of 5V @ 1000mA. 

With regard to an “iPhone not charging” customer complaint in a TCU vehicle (especially iPhone 4) 
The customer may need to use the new Charging Adapter in combination with the regular Y-cable (no 
longer included).

Combox 
4. Functions 

4.1. Audio player via Bluetooth 

The Combox makes it possible to stream audio signals wirelessly via Bluetooth from a corresponding 
source. To do so, the source must support the A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile). A source 
can be a cell phone or MP3 player, for example. The A2DP profile is used to transmit the audio signal 
only. 

The AVRCP (Audio Video Remote Control Profile) is used for remote control of the source. The range 
of functions of the remote control depends on the version of AVRCP supported in the source. Initially 
the Combox will support Version 1.0 and 1.3 of AVRCP. As of 03/2011 version 1.4 of AVRCP will be im¬ 
plemented. 

Note: For optimum functionality of the audio player via Bluetooth, use only BMW recommend¬ 
ed devices. For a list of these devices, please visit http://www.bmwusa.com/bluetooth

Apple devices can now be connected with the original Apple USB cable. 










Combox 
4. Functions 


With the Combox, an iPhone or iPod can now be connected using the customer's “original” Apple 
USB cable. This feature still requires the optional equipment iPod and USB adapter (option 6FL). In 
this case all data and other information, including the audio data, are transmitted via the data lines of 
the USB cable. Because the device is now also charged via this cable the familiar Y-cable is no longer 
needed. 

A 

Non-compatible iPods (e.g. first-generation iPod Nanos) still have to be connected using the 
familiar Y-cable. 


4.6. Album covers 

For MP3 players, USB sticks, MTP players, iPhones and iPods, album covers are displayed if the MP3 
file contains the album cover. For iPhones and iPods, the album cover is not displayed if the connec¬ 
tion is made via the Y-cable. The album covers can only be displayed via USB (option 6FL) and the 
“original” Apple USB cable. 



Note: When iPods are connected via the familiar Y-cable the display of the album cover func¬ 
tion is not supported. 


4.7. Video two-cable connection (Updated 03/2011) 

The ability to play videos from an iPhone on the central information display via a two-cable connection 
was introduced as of 03/2011 with the launch of the FI 2 and BMW Apps (SA 6NR). To do so, in ad¬ 
dition to the USB, the analogue video output of the iPhone snap in adapter and a video ready cradle 
must be connected to the vehicle. The cradle transmits the video information in analogue form the de¬ 
vice to the CIC headunit with the Combox providing control through the USB data lines. 


4.7.1. Video playback 

The new "video base plate" makes it possible to play video clips in BMW vehicles. For safety reasons, 
this function is only supported when the vehicle is stationary. The video clips are displayed in the Cen¬ 
tral Information Display CID only, and not on the rear entertainment displays. The video signal is sent 
to the head unit from the iPhone™ via the “Media” snap-in adapter and base plate (see ST1108 “BMW 
Apps/ConnectedDrive”). Videos can be selected and played from the "CD/Multimedia - External audio 
devices" menu and the "ConnectedDrive - Plugin" menu.

“BMW Apps/ConnectedDrive” available on TIS and ICP. 


4.8. Software updates 

The Coinbox will enable the customer for the first time to update the firmware of a system component. 
To update the Combox, the Bluetooth profile software update must be downloaded from the BMW 
website www.bmwusa.com/bluetooth and stored on a USB stick. For this purpose, any conventional 
USB stick with sufficient storage capacity can be used. The file is then transferred from the USB stick 
to the Combox via the USB audio interface (option 6FL) in the center console. 

Software update by the customer (KISU). 

The customer can purchase a USB stick in the form of a BMW flat key from a BMW Service Center. 
This means the Service Advisor/Parts Sales Consultant can perform a one-off software update for the 
customer. The customer can use the USB stick to perform further software updates himself or, de¬ 
pending on which products are available, do this at the dealership. 

Note: This function is still in development and is expected later in 2011. Please check the 
www.bmwusa.com/bluetooth website for more information.
