M Carbon Ceramic Brake System 

1. Introduction 


Starting in March production of 2013, M Carbon ceramic brakes are available as an option (2NK) on 
the M6 Coupe, M6 Convertible and F06 M Gran Coupe vehicles. M Carbon ceramic brakes will also be 
available as an option in the future with the FI 0 M5. 

The M Carbon ceramic brake system is also called BMW C/SiC brake system (see chapter entitled 
"Design"). 

Depending on the situation, this offers a further increase in active safety compared to the standard M 
Compound brakes. In a direct comparison it also offers: 

• Even more direct/spontaneous use of brake force 

• Higher fading stability 

• Significantly reduced wear 

• 19.4 kg / 42.7 lb weight reduction of rotating wheel masses 

• Increased reliability for winter driving conditions thanks to corrosion resistance.

M Carbon Ceramic Brake System 

1. Introduction 


As a visible distinguishing feature to the M Compound brake system the brake calipers are painted in 
gold. 

The M Carbon ceramic brake system can only be installed with 20" M wheels due to the larger brake 
discs at the front. The 20" M wheels must also be ordered as an option in conjunction with the Carbon 
ceramic brake option 2NK. 

The brake discs are manufactured by Brembo SGL Carbon Ceramic Brakes GmbH.

M Carbon Ceramic Brake System 

3. Design of Brake 

3.1. Introduction 

3.1.1. C/SiC brake disc 

Currently carbon fibers are generally used in the development and application of composite ceramics 
such as the M Carbon ceramic brake disc. The abbreviation "C/SiC" is used for carbon fiber reinforced 
silicon carbide. 

In addition to the intended load, which impacts the brake disc upon braking, this material cannot be 
subject to any mechanical or thermal mechanical deviating load (see also chapter entitled Service 
instructions). 

A 

Due to the special feature of the material, the current information and specifications in the documents 
in the Integrated Service Technical Application must be observed in each case. 


3.2. Brake Disc 


3.2.1. Design and special feature 

The composition of the M Carbon ceramic brake disc is made up of two different materials. The 
support body (2) with the cooling ducts (1) have a sintered silicon carbide ceramic base that is 
reinforced with a high content of carbon fiber direction oriented strands. The inner and outer friction 
coating (3) has a much a higher ceramic content.

Outer friction coating 


The brake disc body is designed using a special shaped part. The fibers (also called "rovings") are 
set down, aligned and fixed similar to the process observed for the manufacturing of fiber-reinforced 
plastic. They have a high carbon content. This forms the support body with the cooling ducts and 
ribs. A thin outer and inner friction coating with high ceramic content is fixed to the support body. The 
braking surface blank, comprising the support body and the two friction coatings, is then baked in a 
special oven at a high temperature, whereby the shaped part is then dissolved. 

Sanding, boring, lapping or milling can take place as part of the finishing work; as is customary for all 
ceramics, only with diamond tools, water jet or laser. 

During cooling a visible cracked pattern is formed on the friction coating, this is called the relaxed 
microstructure. The relaxed microstructure also remains visible after the final finishing process. 

This is normal for this Carbon ceramic brake disc and also remains visible to varying degrees when 
driving.

3. Design of Brake 

A _ _ 

This surface structure formed by the relaxed microstructure has no influence on the performance of 
the brakes. 


3.2.2. Wear characteristics 

The M Carbon ceramic brake disc has a much longer service life than the M Compound brake disc as 
a result of its special friction coating. In an ideal scenario (everyday driving) these brakes can last the 
service life of the vehicle. 

Thanks to the design with the hard friction coating, this technology only shows very minimal signs of 
heavy wear on the brake disc. 

Depending on the thermal load, there can be a slow, continuous loss of strength. This is primarily 
through oxidation of the carbon fibers of the support body at very high temperatures like in sport 
driving usage. The brake disc also loses weight in the process. 

It is a service-specific wear measuring procedure in the development phase which is used at a later 
stage. 

There are currently three wear indicators for the M Carbon ceramic brake disc in addition to checking 
the surface for damage: 

• Three wear indicators per friction surface located every 120°. (1) 

• Minimum brake disc weight. (2) 

• Minimum brake disc thickness. (3)

3. Design of Brake 

3.3. Brake Pads 

3.3.1. Overview 

The brake pad structure of all brake pads is adapted to the surface of the friction coating of the M 
Carbon ceramic brake discs. The brake pads do not have their own special friction coating like the 
brake discs. 

The size of the friction surface and the thickness of the friction pad are adapted to the parameters of 
the M Carbon ceramic brake discs. 

3.3.2. Wear characteristics 

The wear characteristics of the M Carbon ceramic brake pads are better than that of a M Compound 
brake pad. 

Roughly double the service life of a M compound brake pad can be expected. 


3.4. Protective Plate 

The front brake disc protective plates at the swivel bearing have been modified and are specific to the 
M Carbon ceramic brake.

4. Function 

4.1. Braking Performance/Braking Effect 

4.1.1. Cold brake and cold tires 

The spontaneously greater braking effect can reduce the stopping distance slightly depending on 
the situation, caused by the spontaneously higher friction between tires and roadway at the start of 
braking and the resulting quicker heating-up of the tires. 

4.1.2. Warm brake and warm tires 

The braking effect in a warm state could be considerably higher, but will be roughly the same as the M 
Compound brake system, as it is restricted by the adhesion of the tires. 

High braking frequency and heavy usage such as braking from maximum speed to standstill are 
no problem. Also for extreme loads there is no direct material destruction by overheating or fading 
tendency. 

4.1.3. Wet conditions 

Without a dry brake function, for example after washing wheels, a slight deceleration of the higher 
braking effect can be felt, similar to the wet M Compound brake system. 

Through the high braking effect of the M Carbon ceramic brake system the contact force of the brake 
pads in the dry brake function is withdrawn as otherwise it would be noticeable for the passengers. 
This is done by updated software to the Dynamic Stability Control. 

At low speed and cautious braking an audible sound may occur with wet M Carbon ceramic brakes or 
in the case of high humidity. This is due to the current design of the M Carbon ceramic brakes. 

A_ 

In the case of complaints the current information and specifications in the documents in the Integrated 
Service Technical Application must be observed in each case and a PuMA case created if necessary. 


4.1.4. Winter operation 

A big winter advantage of the M Carbon ceramic brake disc in comparison to the M Compound brake 
disc is its corrosion resistance.

• Part number 

• Direction of travel 

• Min. weight (wear weight) 

• Min. thickness (wear thickness) 

• Week/Year of manufacture. 

As the Carbon ceramic friction ring is exposed to alternating temperatures during driving, it uses a 
floating brake disc hub with a unique connection. This allows for expansion and contraction of the 
friction ring.

6. Service Information 

6.1. General Information 

Every impact and collision with hard materials can cause damage to the ceramic surfaces and edges. 

Chipping (1) of the disc surface may mean the brake disc is no longer suitable for installation and 
driving. 

Max permissible width/depth of chip = 2 mm 
Max permissible length = 10 mm 

As a result, a professional check of the brake discs for visible damage must be performed during 
inspection and servicing. Damage may also occur during driving by stone chipping or accident. 

If any of the wear indicators (2) on the disc surface are worn greater than 50% of the entire area, the 
disc requires replacement. 

For more information about assessing the Carbon Ceramic brakes (C/SiC) for wear, Refer to ISTA 34 
11 667.

Each time for performing the check, in the event of uncertainty or assumed borderline values as a 
result of damage and for necessary work, the current information and specifications in the documents 
in the Integrated Service Technical Application must be observed and, if necessary, a PuMA case 
created. 


No machining can be made to the brake disc surfaces. The bolts of the friction ring connection at 
brake disc hub should never be removed, loosened or tightened.

6.2. Dismantling/lnstallation 

During dismantling/installation of the brake disc there is a risk that the wheel rim or add-on parts such 
as brake caliper, brake pads, heat shield, mounting tools, etc. may cause chipping on the ceramic 
through contact. 

For dismantling and installation of the wheel the use of a jack or tire lifting device is the preferred 
method.

The brake pads must have the maximum spreading distance and can only be opened using the BMW 
special tool (no other tools). 

The brake caliper must be removed and installed carefully and without contact with the M Carbon 
ceramic brake disc. After dismantling the brake caliper must be secured with a suitable tool away from 
the brake disc. 


24 






M Carbon Ceramic Brake System 

6. Service Information 



S hook for supporting caliper. 


During removal/installation there must be no force applied to the brake disc. 

The brake disc should only be set down on the hub side, never place the surface of the disc on a work 
bench or floor. 

A brake disc which has been dropped or experiences a heavy impact can no longer be used. The brake 
disc is no longer to be used due to visible and invisible damage. 

For cleaning the M Carbon ceramic brake no brake cleaner or safety cleaner can be used as it has an 
aggressive effect on the friction ring. 

Alcohol can be used as an alternative for cleaning when a brake has cooled down to room temperature. 

A_ 

Do not use any brake cleaner or safety cleaner! 


If no wheel is mounted, extra caution against contact must be taken. The brake disc should be 
protected against external hazards using suitable measures. 


Transport of the brake discs from the parts counter to the workbay should always be done in the 
original packaging. If no original packaging is available for transporting a brake disc, the brake disc 
must be properly packed to protect the disc from collision and damage.

6.3. Breaking in New Brake Pads/discs 

After completing repair work: 

• Perform functional check on brake test stand to ensure compliance with statutory guidelines. 

• Carry out test braking while driving at low speed, the effectiveness of the brakes may be 
reduced during the initial braking operation. 

• Brake pads do not have the optimal wear and contact pattern before approx. 1000 km / 600 
miles. 

Drive cautiously during this period. 

• Advise the customer not to perform any drastic braking in the first 200 km /120 miles after 
brake replacement. 

Refer to ISTA group 34 for additional information.
