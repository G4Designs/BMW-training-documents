B58 Engine 
1. Introduction 


This training manual describes the special characteristics of the B58 engine in the B58B30M0 
variant. It also describes and illustrates differences to the N55 engine in the N55B30M0 variant. The 
document also describes the common factors of the current B38 installed in the 112 and future B48 
and B57 engines. The US market will receive the B58B30M0 ULEVII and B56B30M0 SULEV variants. 

The most important development characteristics relate to BMW EfficientDynamics and its modular 
kit strategy. Using uniform processes means that development and manufacturing costs can be 
lowered. In production, the complexity of the manufacturing process planning and implementation is 
reduced. In Service, the warehousing is simplified as a result of the reduction of part variety, and the 
safe handling of products is increased.

1.2. Modular design 

The B58 6-cylinder engine forms part of the new in-line engine family. The B58 engine features 
elements including double VANOS, TwinPower exhaust turbocharger technology, indirect charge air 
cooling that has been integrated into the intake system and a heat management module. 

The EfficientDynamics strategy of the N engine generation has resulted in a large number of different 
technologies finding their way into the BMW engine world. The strategy for the simplification of 
inspection work is also pursued with the B engine generation. 

The new engine generation is mainly characterized by lower fuel consumption and fewer exhaust 
emissions (It complies with Euro 6 in ECE and ULEV II in the US). A characteristic map-controlled 
oil pump, an injection system with direct rail and electric arc wire injection cylinder bores are used 
to achieve low fuel consumption. All engines are also equipped with an automatic engine start-stop 
function and intelligent generator control as a further EfficientDynamics measure. 

Compared with the N engines, the new B engine generation demonstrates a considerably higher 
number of common and interchangeable parts with the Bx7 diesel engines and the Bx8 gasoline 
engines.

In comparison to the N55 engine, the fixtures for the VANOS solenoid valve actuators of the B58 are

actuators has also changed. They are not bolted on, but are attached to the cylinder head cover using 
a bayonet fitting and retaining clips. A new special tool has been developed for removal and installation 
without causing damage.

Separation at partial load operation 


The crankcase ventilation in Bx8 engines is designed as a two-stage system and has the following 
objectives: 

• Regulation of the internal engine pressure 

• Cleaning the blow-by gases to remove engine oil 

• Recirculation of the cleaned blow-by gases in the intake area 

When the engine is in operation, blow-by gases from the combustion chamber pass through the 
cylinder walls and enter the crankcase chamber. These blow-by gases contain unburnt fuel and 
exhaust gases. They are mixed with engine oil in the crankcase (in the form of oil mist). 

The volume of the blow-by gases is dependent on the engine speed and the load. Without crankcase 
ventilation excess pressure would arise in the crankcase. This excess pressure would be present in all 
cavities connected to the crankcase (e.g. oil return duct, chain shaft, etc.) and lead to oil leakage at the 
seals. 


12 















B58 Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 


The crankcase ventilation prevents this. It routes the extensively engine oil-free blow-by gases to 
the clean air pipe and the separated droplets of oil flow back to the oil sump via an oil return pipe. In 
addition, the crankcase ventilation, in combination with a pressure control valve, ensures a low vacuum 
in the crankcase.

Cooling concept of cylinder head 

The B58 engine is equipped with a cylinder head featuring transverse flow cooling. In the case of 
cross-flow cooling, the coolant flows from the hot exhaust side to the cooler intake side. This has the 
advantage of enabling a more uniform heat distribution to prevail throughout the cylinder head. Loss of 
pressure in the cooling circuit is also prevented. 

2.1.3. Crankcase 

The crankcase is a completely new design which takes the different requirements of gasoline and 
diesel engines into account in one common part.

Characteristics of crankcase: 

The closed deck crankcase was equipped with a completely new structure which can be identified by 
a complex array of ribs on the exhaust and intake side and an additional reinforcement frame on the oil 
sump side. The structural measures of the B58 are summarized below: 

• Heat-treated all aluminum crankcase made from AISiMgCu 0.5 

• Electric arc wire-sprayed cylinder walls 

• Weight-optimized main bearing cap of crankshaft 

• Closed deck design 

• Deep skirt 

• Oil ducts for the use of a map-controlled oil pump 


Electric arc wire spraying (LDS) 



Electric arc wire spraying method, Bx8 engine 


15 








B58 Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 

The cylinder walls of the B58 engine are coated with electric arc wire spray (LDS). In this procedure a 
conductive metal wire is heated until it melts. The melt is then sprayed onto the cylinder barrels at high 
pressure. This layer of ferrous material is roughly 0.3 mm thick, extremely wear-resistant and facilitates 
an efficient transfer of heat from the combustion chambers to the crankcase, and from there to the 
coolant ducts. 

Advantages: 

• Lower weight 

• High wear resistance 

• Good heat dissipation to the crankcase 

• Lower internal engine friction due to excellent lubrication properties 


A 

Due to the thin material application during the electric arc wire-spraying procedure, subsequent 
machining of the cylinder barrels is not possible. 


Closed deck 

With the closed-deck design, the coolant ducts around the cylinder are closed from above and 
provided with coolant bore holes. This design is mainly reserved for BMW diesel engines. Due to the 
high combustion pressures in the diesel engine, a greater degree of rigidity is required in order that the 
forces can be safely absorbed. As the gasoline engine uses the same unfinished cast part as the diesel 
engine, it also benefits from this robust design. 

Deep Skirt 

With the "deep skirt" concept, the side walls extend far downwards. This lends the crankcase a high 
degree of stability and considerable flexibility in terms of the piston stroke length. 

Embossed crankshaft bearing cap 

The weight of the main bearing caps on the crankshaft was further enhanced for the new B58 engine. 
The new main bearing caps are common parts for the Bx8 engines. When the impression connection 
is made the main bearing cap is designed with a profile. When the main bearing bolts are tightened for 
the first time, this profile pushes into the surface of the bearing block on the crankcase side. 

A 

Replacing the main bearing caps, or positioning in another bearing position on the crankshaft, is not 
allowed and will lead to engine damage.

Connecting rod bearing shell of the connecting rod (IROX-coated) 


The Drop-forged, cracked connecting rods installed in the B58 have enhanced weight when compared 
to the B48 engine. 


A 

If a connecting rod bearing cap is mounted the wrong way round or on another connecting rod, the 
fracture structure of both parts is destroyed and the connecting rod bearing cap is no longer centered. 
In this event the entire connecting rod set must be replaced with new parts in Service please observe 
the specified tightening torque and angle of rotation specifications in the repair instructions. 


IROX coating 

In order to comply with the increasingly stringent exhaust emission regulations, most combustion 
engines today are equipped with an automatic engine start-stop function. This has led to a huge 
increase in starting cycles. 

To ensure the engine runs smoothly, it is important that sufficient lubricating oil is supplied to the 
bearing positions of the crankshaft. If the oil supply can be ensured, solid body contact will not 
occur between the connecting rod bearing journal and connecting rod bearing shell due to the thin 
lubricating film. 

If the engine is now stopped, it will not be possible for the mechanically-driven oil pump to maintain 
the oil supply. The oil film between the bearing positions flows off. Solid body contact occurs between 
the connecting rod bearing journal and connecting rod bearing shell. Once the engine is restarted, it 
takes a certain amount of time for the lubricating film to fully re-establish itself. The connecting rod 
bearing shell may be subject to wear in this short period. The IROX coating reduces this wear to a 
minimum. 

The IROX-coated bearing shells are only located on the connecting rod side as here the load acts 
mainly on the bearing shells. The bearing shell caps are equipped with a bearing shell without IROX 
coating. 

The IROX bearing shells are red due to their special coating.

Binding resin 


Solid lubricant 


The IROX coating is applied to a conventional bearing shell. It consists of a binding resin matrix made 
of polyamide-imide with embedded hard particles and solid lubricants. The polyamide-imide ensures, 
in combination with the hard particles, that the bearing shell surface is so hard that material abrasion 
is no longer possible. The solid lubricants reduce surface friction and replace the oil film which briefly 
no longer exists between the bearing shell and the connecting rod bearing journal during the starting 
phase. 

Bearing shell classification of connecting rod bearing 

The connecting rod bearing shells are available in one standard size. It is therefore not necessary to 
follow a procedure similar to that used with the main bearing shells of the crankshaft.

The chain drive is on the transmission side. The inertia of the transmission at this end of the engine 
significantly reduces the rotary oscillations and also therefore the loads acting on the chain drive. 

Features: 

• Chain drive at the side of the engine emitting the forces 

• Simple sleeve-type chains 

• Electric motor of the combined oil-vacuum pump via a separate chain 

• Plastic tensioning rails and guide rails 

• Hydraulic chain tensioner with spring preload 

As a standard crankcase is used for both gasoline and diesel engines, the Bx8 engines are equipped 
with a two-part chain drive. With this arrangement, the bottom timing chain drives the camshaft 
sprocket of the intermediate shaft. In the diesel engines, the output for the high pressure pump is 
located on this intermediate shaft. In the gasoline engines, the drive torque is simply diverted to 
the top timing chain via the intermediate shaft. In contrast to diesel engines, there is no ancillary 
component output. 

The lubrication of the bottom timing chain is ensured by the oil mist in the crankcase and the engine oil 
that drips off. 

In the Bx8 engines, the combined oil-vacuum pump is also driven by the crankshaft via a separate drive 
chain.

The valve overlap times have a significant impact on the characteristics of a gasoline engine. An 
engine with smaller valve overlap therefore tends to have a high maximum torque at low engine speeds 
but the maximum power which can achieved at high engine speeds is low. The maximum power 
achieved with a large valve overlap on the other hand is higher, but this is at the expense of the torque 
at low engine speeds.

The VANOS provides a solution. It makes a high torque possible in the low and medium engine speed 
range and a high maximum power in the higher engine speed ranges. A further benefit of the VANOS 
is the option of internal EGR. This reduces the emission of harmful nitrogen oxides NOx, particularly in 
the partial load range. The following is also achieved: 

• Faster heating up of catalytic converter 

• Lower pollutant emissions during cold start 

• Reduction in consumption 


2.3.2. Valvetronic 

The Valvetronic has been further developed for use in the new Bx8 engines. A distinguishing feature of 
the VVT4 is the Valvetronic servomotor is located outside of the cylinder head.

Valvetronic comprises a fully-variable valve lift control and a double VANOS. It operates according to 
the principle of throttle-free load control. With this system, a throttle valve is only used to stabilize the 
engine operation at critical operating points and to ensure a slight vacuum for the engine ventilation. 
A very small vacuum can be produced in the intake pipe by slightly tilting the throttle valve, which 
allows treated blow-by gases to be introduced into the intake port during naturally-aspirated engine 
operation. 

The following graphic provides an overview of the design of the Valvetronic. 

The following components have been revised in the Valvetronic for use in the B58 engine: 

• Assembled eccentric shaft 

• Adjustment range increased from 190° (N55) to 253° (B58) 

• Smaller worm gear ratio of 37:1 

• Thinner lighter sliding blocks with only one screw connection 

• Return spring inserted and not bolted 

• Oil spray nozzle for lubrication of worm gear omitted 

• Smaller more powerful Valvetronic servomotor

Height of installation space 


By reworking the Valvetronic, it has been possible to significantly reduce the installation space. A 
considerable height advantage has been gained by swapping round the intake camshaft and the 
eccentric shaft. The new position of the intermediate lever and gate simplifies the application of force 
in the cylinder head. The gate is therefore only attached to the bearing support with one screw and is 
positioned via two precise contact surfaces in the cylinder head. The return spring for the intermediate 
lever between the cylinder head and bearing position is self-supporting and does not require its own 
attachment point. The eccentric shaft is, as is already the case with the camshaft, an "assembled" 
design.

Due to the fast adjustment speeds of the eccentric shaft of less than 300 milliseconds from minimum 
to maximum stroke and the wide adjustment range from 0.2 millimeters (minimum) to 9.9 millimeters 
(maximum) valve lift with a small transmission ratio, sufficient lubrication between the worm gear of the 
Valvetronic servomotor and the input pinion of the eccentric shaft must be ensured. The lubricating oil 
reaches the oil chamber via an inlet hole at the first bearing position of the eccentric shaft. Here, the 
oil volume rises to the lower edge of the outlet hole. The excess oil flows back to the oil circuit via the 
outlet hole. The gearing of the worm gear is now supported in the oil bath and is therefore lubricated at 
all times. 

Information on disassembly and installation work 

As numerous changes have been made, a new special tool is used to remove the return springs. 

The hexagon socket on the Valvetronic servomotor is for manual adjustment of the worm gear. This 
is necessary if the Valvetronic servomotor needs to be removed, for example. To avoid damage to the 
worm gear, it must be greased prior to start-up using a special lubricant (Longtime PD part number: 

83 19 2 160 340). The Valvetronic in the Digital Engine Electronics (DME) can be taught-in using the 
teach-in routine in ISTA. During this process, the limit positions of the system are determined once 
again and stored in the Digital Engine Electronics (DME). The precise procedure for removing the 
Valvetronic is described in the current repair instructions.

The belt drive is a single-belt drive in which all ancillary components are driven using only one belt. 


The length of the drive belt changes due to thermal expansion and ageing. The drive belt must be 
pressed onto the belt pulley with a defined force to ensure the torque can be transferred at any time. 
Therefore the belt tension is exerted by an automatic tensioning pulley which compensates for belt 
stretching over the full service life.

3. Oil Supply 

3.1. Oil circuit 

With force-fed circulation lubrication the oil is drawn out of the oil sump by the oil pump through 
an intake pipe and forwarded into the circuit. The oil passes through the engine oil cooler with an 
integrated full-flow oil filter and from there into the main oil duct, which runs in the engine block parallel 
to the crankshaft. Branch ducts lead to the crankshaft main bearings. There are bore holes between 
the main bearings of the crankshaft and the connecting rod bearing journal which admit the oil to the 
lubricating points of the connecting rod bearing. 

Some of the oil is diverted from the main oil duct and directed to the cylinder head to the relevant 
lubricating points and adjustment units. When the engine oil flows through the consumers, it either 
returns to the oil sump via the return ducts or it drips back freely. 


3.2. Map control 

The Bx8 engines are equipped with the familiar map-controlled oil pump which is already used. 

The actual oil pressure is recorded via an oil pressure sensor and forwarded to the Digital Engine 
Electronics (DME). The Digital Engine Electronics (DME) performs a target/actual comparison based 
on the stored characteristic maps. The map-controlled control valve is activated by means of a pulse- 
width modulated signal until the nominal pressure stored in the characteristic map has been reached. 
During this process, the delivery rate of the oil pump varies according to the oil pressure in the oil duct 
to the map-controlled control chamber. 


3.3. Oil pump 

The oil pump plays a central role in modern combustion engines. Due to the high power and enormous 
torque which is present even at low engine speeds, it is necessary to ensure a reliable oil supply. This 
is necessary due to the high component temperatures and heavily loaded bearings. To achieve low fuel 
consumption, the delivery rate of the oil pump must be adapted to the requirements. 

The oil pump is driven by a chain from the crankshaft.

Bearing tube (center of rotation) 


A vacuum pump is integrated into the oil pump housing. 

A rotor with pendulum rotates on the pump shaft as shown in the graphic. A crescent-shaped cavity 
arises through the eccentric position. During this process, the oil is drawn into the expanding chamber 
(intake side) and is supplied via the contracting chamber (pressure side). 

When the engine is in operation, oil pressure is applied to the map-controlled control surface and 
the second-level control surface of the oil pump. Depending on the oil pressure, the adjusting ring is 
pushed via the center of rotation at the bearing tube to varying degrees of force against the adjusting 
ring springs. The change in eccentric position of the adjusting ring changes the size of the chamber, 
and therefore also the intake and pressure power of the oil pump. 

To prevent overloading of the oil pump, a filter is installed upstream of the pump inlet. The maximum 
oil pressure of the oil circuit at the pump outlet is restricted by a pressure limiting valve. The opening 
pressure of the pressure limiting valve is 11.4 bar +/- 1.4 bar. 

3.3.1. Normal operation 

The oil pump has two separate control loops in order to guarantee normal operation (map-controlled 
control operation) and emergency operation (second-level control operation). 

3.3.2. Emergency operation 

During emergency operation, the system operates without the map control by the Digital Engine 
Electronics (DME). The map-controlled control valve is de-energized in this operating condition and 
is therefore closed. The purpose of the emergency operation is to maintain the oil pressure in the 
oil pump at a consistently high level. The oil pressure is guided directly from the main oil duct to the 
second-level control chamber. This leads to an adjustment of the adjusting ring against the adjusting 
ring spring and thus a reduction of the volumetric flow. As it contains no actuators, intervention in this 
control system is not possible and it also cannot be switched off.

3.4.1. Filter bypass valve 

When a filter is obstructed, the filter bypass valve ensures that engine oil reaches the lubrication points

bar +/- 0.3 bar. 


3.4.2. Heat exchanger bypass valve 

The heat exchanger bypass valve has the same function as the filter bypass valve. If, as a result of 
a blocked oil-to-water heat exchanger, the oil pressure rises, the filter bypass valve opens at an oil 
pressure of 2.5 bar ± 0.3 bar and the lubricating oil can flow uncooled to the lubrication points.

In order to protect components from overheating damage, the engine oil as well as the transmission 
fluid are cooled using coolant. A mechanical coolant pump circulates the coolant in the cooling circuit. 
The heat is removed by the coolant and re-emitted to the ambient air using a heat exchanger (radiator). 
An electric fan is used to assist the radiator output. 

4.1.1. Special features 

The special features of the B58 cooling system include: 

• Heat management module 

• Mechanical coolant pump 


4.2. Heat management module 

In engines with a thermostat and expansion element the coolant heats up the wax inside an operating 
housing. The wax liquefies from a certain, specified temperature. In this process, it expands and 
acts on a working piston in the housing, which releases the coolant flow towards the radiator using 
a poppet valve. If the coolant temperature falls below the opening temperature, a spring presses 
the poppet back into its initial position and closes the coolant flow towards the radiator. The engine 
maintains a specified temperature range. 

In electrically heated thermostats the wax in the operating element is heated up by the coolant and 
additionally by electrical heating. This combination allows the Digital Motor Electronics (DME) to 
control the engine temperature of the different load conditions more precisely. 

The conventional thermostat in the B58 engine is replaced by a so-called heat management module. 
The following graphic shows the installation position of the heat management module.

The opening cross-sections of the various cooling ducts can be variably opened and closed using a 
rotary valve. The Digital Motor Electronics (DME) require elements including the coolant temperature 
from the coolant temperature sensor and the material temperature of the cylinder head from the 
component temperature sensor to correctly position the rotary valve.

B58 Engine

A position sensor in the electrical actuator of the heat management module forwards the current 
position of the rotary valve to the Digital Motor Electronics (DME). As a result, the exact position 
of the rotary valve can be determined so that it releases or seals a precisely defined cross-section 
towards the different coolant ducts. The adjustment of cross-sections ideally adapts the flow rates 
of the cooling ducts connected to the heat management module to the operating points. Warm-up 
and cooling of the engine and the supply of additional ancillary components can be implemented as 
required and therefore the fuel consumption is reduced.

Engine at operating temperature, Figure C 

Figure C shows the control in normal conditions (operating temperature). The cross-sections to 
the corresponding connections are opened to a greater or lesser extent depending on the coolant 
temperature, so that coolant can flow through the minor and main coolant circuit and the heater circuit. 

Maximum cooling requirement, Figure D 

The radiator connection is opened by 100% and the short-circuit line is completely closed to provide 
maximum cooling at high dynamic loads and/or high ambient temperatures. In this process, the heat 
exchanger for the heating system is blocked by 90% to be able to provide the radiator with even more 
volumetric flow. 

The coolant connection to the expansion tank is not controlled. As a result, it is permanently open so 
that any coolant demand in the coolant circuit can be compensated for by the expansion tank at any 
time.

5. Intake Air and Exhaust System 

5.1. Intake air system 

The unfiltered air reaches the intake silencer with air cleaner via the unfiltered air line with intake air 
grille. The unfiltered air is filtered in the intake silencer with air cleaner. Then the clean air is directed 
to the turbocharger via the hot film air mass meter and the clean air pipe. Depending on the load 
condition, the blow-by gases from the crankcase are also introduced into the clean air pipe upstream 
of the turbocharger or directly into the intake ports. 

The clean air is compressed and heated in the turbocharger. The compressed, warm charge air is then 
sent to the charge air cooler via a charge air hose. From the charge air cooler the now cooled charge 
air is directed to the intake system via an additional charge air hose and the adapter pipe with charge 
air temperature and charging pressure sensor.

The amount of oxygen which can be sent into the combustion chamber is reduced because the air 
heats up and expands during compression in the turbocharger. The charge air cooler counteracts this 
effect by cooling compressed air and achieving the best possible conditions for combustion. The air 
density is increased and therefore oxygen content per volume is also increased. 


46 










B58 Engine 

5. Intake Air and Exhaust System 

Two charge air intercooler types are currently used. Direct, air-cooled charge air cooling and indirect, 
coolant-based charge air cooling. 

Direct charge air cooling is the most common type of intercooler and is used in the majority of forced 
induction engines. In this process, the compressed air is discharged into the ambient air using an 
air-to-air heat exchanger located in the air flow in front of the vehicle. In contrast, indirect charge air 
cooling cools the charge air with an air-to-coolant heat exchanger which is located on the engine, 
between the compressor and the throttle valve. 

In the B58 engine the charge air intercooler has been integrated into the intake plenum (integrated, 
indirect charge air cooler — ILLK). The compressed air flows through the charge air intercooler in 
several plates, around which the coolant flows. 

The benefits of integrated, indirect charge air cooling are: 

• Lower charge air volume between compressor and intake valve 

• More even temperature distribution within the intake ports 

• Increased performance due to higher intake pressure 

• Improved response characteristics due to the use of a smaller turbocharger 

• Reduction in consumption by modifying the ignition point and transmission ratio

Turbine housing 


The exhaust turbocharger of the B58 engine is a twin-scroll turbocharger (6 in 2 exhaust manifold). 
The exhaust manifold of the 3rd and 4th cylinder and the turbocharger housing form one single cast 
steel part which cannot be replaced individually. The exhaust manifolds of the 1st/2nd cylinders and 
the 5th/6th cylinders consist of multiple parts. They consist of stainless steel exhaust manifold pipes 


50 













B58 Engine 

5. Intake Air and Exhaust System 

which have been formed by applying internal pressure and feature forged stainless steel flanges that 
are welded on as well as an expansion compensation unit made of a nickel and chrome alloy installed 
between the turbine housing and the exhaust manifold. 

The expansion compensation units compensate for material expansion and contraction as a result of 
both low and high temperatures between the turbine housing and the exhaust manifold and safeguard 
tension-free connections. The expansion compensation units are welded to the turbine housing 
and the exhaust manifold and cannot be replaced individually. So-called sliding seats are used in 
their assembly. In this process, two pipe sections are connected to each other until there is merely a 
distance of a few tenths of a millimeter to allow the material to expand in length at high temperatures. 

Transport protection caps must be used for installation at the engine assembly plant as well as for 
disassembly in the vehicle or on the removed engine to prevent damage. During installation it is also 
important to follow the tightening sequence for all bolt connections. 

A_ 

In the event of repairs, the replacement part exhaust turbocharger must be inserted and installed in 
the clamping strip with installed transport protection caps. Only when the installation is complete is it 
possible to remove the transport protection caps. 


5.2.2. Charging pressure control 

The charging pressure is adjusted via an electrical actuator. An electrically controlled wastegate valve 
controls the charging pressure control in the B58 engine. 

Electrified adjustment 

In contrast to a vacuum-controlled charging pressure control, the following components are not 
required: 

• Vacuum unit 

• Vacuum lines 

• Electro-pneumatic pressure converter 

• Vacuum reservoir. 

Advantages of electrical activation 

• Faster control speed 

• More precise control

The actuator of the electrically adjustable wastegate valve features a direct current motor and a sensor, 
resulting in a total of five electrical connections. The wastegate valve is opened or closed by a lifting 
movement of the linkage. 

The actuator of the electrically adjustable wastegate valve can be replaced separately in service. Each 
time the adjusting linkage is activated, the system must be re-adjusted with the assistance of the 
BMW diagnosis system ISTA. This measure is not required when replacing the entire turbocharger as 
the linkage is supplied preset. 

A 

If the actuator is replaced individually, a teach-in routine must be performed using the BMW ISTA 
diagnosis system. 

As the position sensor is a linear Hall sensor, a resistance measurement for testing the sensor is not 
permitted.

* For vehicles with direct fuel injection. 

The abbreviations of the terms which appear in the table are explained below: 

• CO = carbon monoxide 

• HC = hydrocarbon 

• NOx = nitrogen oxide 

• NMHC = non-methane hydrocarbons 

• PM = particle matter (fine dust) 

• PN = particulate concentration 

Since EURO 5, more stringent regulations have been in force for engines with direct fuel injection. 
From EURO 5, the particulate matter has been evaluated, followed subsequently by the particle 
concentration with the introduction of EURO 6. The reason for this is that in modern gasoline engines 
with direct injection no homogeneous fuel/air mixture arises in comparison to engines with intake pipe 
fuel injection. There are therefore more particles in the exhaust gas (particulate matter). 

Further obligations of the manufacturer are monitoring of continuous-service capability of emission 
reduction equipment over a total distance of 160,000 km (100,000 miles) and correct function over a 
period of five years, or 100,000 km (62,000 miles). For this reason, modern combustion engines come 
with many adaptations that prevent breaches of exhaust emission standards due to use of older fuel.

A _ 

In the US market the B58 engine is classified as an ULEV II emission standard engine. 

The B58 engine complies with both the EURO 6 (in ECE) and ULEV II (in the US) exhaust emission 
standards' limits upon its market introduction. 

Measures for reduction of exhaust gas emissions 

• Precise and fast charging pressure control 

• Catalytic converter heating during cold start 

• Positioning of catalytic converter near engine 

• New LSF Xfour voltage-jump sensor by Bosch. 


Catalytic converter heating 

When starting the combustion engine from cold, the wastegate valve is opened as wide as possible 
and the ignition point is adjusted to retard. The retarded ignition point delays the combustion process 
which in turn supports the heat input for heating of the catalytic converter. As the turbine housing is 
short, it has been possible to position the catalytic converter very close to the wastegate valve. As the 
exhaust gas flows into the catalytic converter at the perfect angle and because of its position close 
to the engine, the catalytic converter reaches its operating temperature very quickly. If the wastegate 
valve is opened when cold, pulsation of the exhaust gas may cause vibrations in the wastegate valve, 
which are perceived as noise. This is not due to a defective component, and is normal running noise. 
This noise becomes less audible as the temperature of the component increases. 

Positioning 

The catalytic converter near the engine ensures low exhaust temperatures upstream of the catalytic 
converter input and therefore considerably reduces the degree of catalytic converter ageing.

6.1. Vacuum pump 

In the B58 engine the vacuum pump and the oil pump are located in a shared housing. 

The vacuum duct connects to the vacuum pump, passing through the transmission end of the 
crankcase. There is a plastic connection at the output of the crankcase to which the various 
consumers are connected. There is a non-return valve inside this plastic connection.

Plastic vane 


There is a steel rotor with a plastic vane on the inside of the vacuum pump. It is driven together with 
the oil pump via a chain from the crankshaft. 

The evacuating output of the vacuum pump is 500 mbar vacuum (absolute) in less than six seconds. 

As the running surfaces of the vacuum pump are coated with oil, the volume of air drawn in cannot 
be released into the atmosphere. The air volume delivered by the vacuum pump is transferred to 
the crankcase via discharge valves. From here, it reaches the air intake system via the crankcase 
ventilation.

The fuel supply is described in the respective product training manuals for the models. 


7.1. Fuel preparation 

The fuel preparation has been modified to meet the requirements of emission legislation. The injectors 
have now been bolted to a newly developed direct rail with integrated high-pressure sensor.

The direct injection system has been taken over from the B48 and forms part of the so-called synergy 
or adapted parts (from other engines). The direct rail represents a departure from the familiar systems 
used up till now. Here the injectors without high pressure and leakage oil lines are attached to the rail. 


Directly connecting the solenoid valve injectors to the rail has the following advantages: 

• Less volume needs to be available for high-pressure injection 

• Fewer interfaces and therefore less problematic with respect to leaks 

• Short cycle times during production due to compact design

Utmost cleanliness must be observed when carrying out any work on the fuel system!

Solenoid valve injector 


The solenoid valve injectors are fastened to the holding clamp with a bayonet fitting. There is a plastic 
sleeve between the holding clamp and direct rail. This is not designed to collect escaping fuel. Its only 
purpose is to carry out a helium pressure test during preassembly at the factory in order to check the 
tightness. After the initial assembly, this plastic sleeve is of no relevance to the engine operation. When 
the solenoid valve injectors are replaced, the plastic sleeves are no longer required and do not need to 
be reinserted. 

Casting lugs develop during production of the retaining bridge when the component is separated from 
the tool. As a result of the low installation tolerances it is necessary to make sure during installation 
of the solenoid valve injectors that said cast lugs point in the direction of the exhaust manifold. 
Mechanical contact between the retaining bridge and the cylinder head cover may result if the cast 
lugs are pointing in the wrong direction (towards the intake pipe).

The shank of the solenoid valve injector is sensitive to high pressure and tensile force as well as 
rotational angles. When removing and installing the solenoid valve injectors, the procedure in the 
current repair instructions must be followed! If the solenoid valve injectors are damaged, fuel may be 
discharged.

As with the N55 engine, the new B58 engine is also equipped with the Bosch HDEV 5.2 solenoid valve 
injector. The designation of the injectors is a combination of the following: 

• HDEV = high-pressure fuel injection valve 

• 5 = generation designation 

• 1 = maximum fuel injection pressure of 150 bar 

• 2 = maximum fuel injection pressure of 200 bar. 

When current is supplied to the solenoid coil, a magnetic field is produced which attracts the magnet 
armature. The magnet armature runs upwards on the nozzle needle. The linear travel of the magnet 
armature in the direction of the solenoid coil carries the nozzle needle along with it and the nozzle 
bores are released in the direction of the combustion chamber. 

The most current repair instructions must be followed when removing and installing the injectors in 
Service. If the rotational angle at the shank of the injector is too large, this can lead to damage and 
therefore leaks in the fuel system. 

A special fuel additive is recommended in markets with a poor fuel grade to prevent coking of injectors 
in direct injection systems. The additive is added to the fuel in the fuel tank from where it arrives at the 
injectors.

Using an additive approved by BMW (part number 83 19 2 183 738). 


Solenoid valve injector 

Due to the more stringent exhaust gas emission regulations which are required to meet the EURO 6 
exhaust emission standards, technical changes had to be made to the solenoid valve injectors. These 
changes have been in effect in the US for some time now, they were introduced in the S55 
engine and to the N20 and N55 engine as part of a rolling change. 

As is the case with diesel fuel passenger cars which has been previously discussed (in the N47 and 
N57 training material), in addition to the limit value for particulate mass (PM), the limit value for the 
particle concentration (PN) is also stipulated in the exhaust emission standards for gasoline passenger 
cars. 


63 










via BIMMERPOST.com 


B58 Engine 
7. Fuel System 

The reason for this is that in modern gasoline engines with direct injection no homogeneous fuel/ 
air mixture arises in comparison to engines with intake port fuel injection. There are therefore more 
particles in the exhaust gas (particulate matter). 

As with the S55, N20 and N55 different diameters of (laser-manufactured) bore holes are used with 
the new high-pressure fuel injection valves, for example. The fuel quantity of the two spray jets in the 
exhaust direction is reduced by 20 %, which increases the other spray jets by 10 % respectively. For 
more information see the S55 engine training manual. 

The solenoid valve injectors can only be used in a predefined position in the injector shaft of the 
cylinder head. This ensures correct alignment of the injection pattern in the combustion chamber. 

The following graphic illustrates the differences between the EURO 5 and EURO 6 version:

High-pressure fuel injection valves with solenoid coils do not have a linear behavior pattern across the 
entire service life, mainly in the area of minimal quantity fuel injection. This means over the service 
life the fuel injection rates vary from one injector to another injector and also from each individual 
injector. Although the high-pressure fuel injection valves are adapted during start-up via the injection 
quantity compensation code in the Digital Engine Electronics (DME) in order to compensate for 
possible manufacturing tolerances of the individual high-pressure fuel injection valves in the Digital 
Engine Electronics (DME), and to adapt all injectors in relation to one another, this only happens once 
during start-up (injection quantity compensation). During conventional operation, the parameters 
for activation of the injectors, such as current and activation duration, are the same for all injectors 
throughout the entire operating time and cannot be individually adapted. Another adaptation during 
the entire operating time is no longer possible. This would lead to breaches of the strict exhaust gas 
emissions legislation, such as EURO 6 and ULEVII, during the operating time. 

An automatic operation allows precise dosing of fuel, particularly when using extremely small injection 
quantities. Analysis of the voltage and current curve in injector mode allows conclusions to be drawn 
about the movement of the needle. The most important information in relation to the movement of the 
needle is the needle travel and opening period. The fuel injection rate can be determined from these 
two variables. It has therefore been possible to omit printing of a injection quantity compensation code 
on the new solenoid valve injectors. 

Service note 

When replacing injectors, the taught-in values of the Control Valve Operating (CVO) function and the 
cylinder imbalance (CIM, US only) function must be reset. This is done with the assistance of the BMW 
diagnosis system ISTA. Adjustment functions are available in the service functions. In order to notify 
the Digital Motor Electronics (DME) about the injector exchange, these new type of solenoid valve 
injector are all taught in with the same dummy value (215). Once the teach-in procedure has been 
successfully completed, the stored adaptations are reset and new adaptations are taught in via the 
CVO and CIM function.

Explanation

Component temperature sensor 


The B58 engine uses a component temperature sensor in addition to the coolant temperature sensor 
to control the coolant more precisely with the heat management module. It records the material 
temperature of the cylinder head around the exhaust gas duct of the first cylinder and forwards it to 
the DME control unit. As a result, power, consumption and pollutant emissions can be influenced even 
more efficiently. 

This two-pin temperature sensor is a temperature-sensitive resistor (NTC) which covers a temperature 
range of between - 40 °C and 150 °C (- 40 °F and 302 °F). The temperature is transferred to the 
sensor using an elastic heat coupler attached to the outside of the sensor.

The new DME generation is designated as DME 8. 

Depending on the engine version, DME will be given a certain designation. The following section

DME 8.x.y.z (x = number of cylinders, y = vehicle electrical system architecture, z = H = Hybrid) is 
encoded as follows: 

• DME 8.4.0 = B48
