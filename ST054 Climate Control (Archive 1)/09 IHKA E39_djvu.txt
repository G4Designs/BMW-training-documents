INTRODUCTION 


The E39 IHKA follows the IHKA E38 system and provides features and functions simiiar to 
that unit. It incorporates the foiiowing features: 

• Integrated control panel/module. 

• Separate temperature control for the driver and front passenger. 

• Air flap control through the use of bussed stepper motors. 

• Automatic Recirculation Control (AUC). 

• Recirculation air flap control from the MEL. 

• “REST” function for residual heat when vehicle is stopped. 

• Service station feature that closes the water valves when stopped to prevent hot water 
circulating into the heater cores. 

• A/C compressor clutch activation through a final stage control. 

• Center face vent stratification control through a bowden cable.

COMPONENTS 

The major components of the IHKA E39 heater case include: 

• Two heater cores with separate inlets and 
one common outlet. 

• Two heater core temperature sensors and 
one evaporator temperature sensor. 

• One evaporator with expansion valve. 

• Five stepper motors (six as of 9/97) - four 
on the M-Bus link and one conventionally 
controlled. 

• One auxiliary water pump. 

• One blower motor and relay with final stage 
output control (final stage located in air flow 
on passenger side of IHKA housing).

CONTROL PANEL/MODULE 


All heater/ air conditioner operation is controlled fronn the button and rocker switches 
located on the control panel. The control nnodule is integrated into the control panel and 
contains all of the control electronics except the final stage for the blower motor control. 



The control module oontains a fault memory in a non volatile RAM and inoorporates a sleep 
mode when the ignition is switched off. The control module will switch to the sleep mode 
16 minutes after the ignition is switched off. The control panel consists of the following: 


AIR DISTRIBUTION BUTTONS: Manual distribution buttons with selection for: 



Defrost - air to the windshield without maximum defrost. 



Air distribution to the faoe vents. 


• Air distribution to the footwell outlets. 

The defrost, face vent and footwell buttons can be selected in any order for distribution to 
the desired vents. 



AUTO 


AUTO: Overrides the manual buttons and provides distribution based on 
the control module settings as with other systems. 



TEMPERATURE SELECTION BUTTONS: For the driver 
passenger’s side with digital temperature readout in the LCD. 


and 



There is one LCD panel for the display of both the left/right 
temperature selections and the blower speed. 


side 



REST BUTTON: For activation of the residual heat feature.

AIR VOLUME CONTROL ROCKER SWITCH: The air 

volume can be adjusted through 16 steps using the rocker 
switch. The selected volume is displayed as a wedge on the 
LCD panel. 


Null/ 


FRONT WINDSHIELD DEFROST: - Maximum defrost to the front 
windshield is provided by pressing this button. This over rides the other 
distribution button settings and switches on the rear defroster 
simultaneously. 



AIR CONDITIONING BUTTON: - Pressing the snowflake is the A/C on 
request input to the control module. 



RECIRCULATION/AUTOMATIC RECIRCULATION (AUC) BUTTON: 

The button allows switching between: 


• Fresh/Recirculated air flap activation 


• Automatic control of Fresh/Recirculated air flaps. 


The AUC system incorporates a sensor that reacts to the levels of oxidizable gasses in the 
ambient air. When the levels exceed a set value stored in the IHKA control module, the 
system switches automatically to the recirculation air mode. 




REAR DEFROSTER BUTTON: - When pressed, the rear defroster is 
switched on for: 


10 minutes with the outside temperature > 14°F. 
17 minutes with the outside temperature < 14°F. 


After the initial timed duration, each subsequent pressing of the button will switch the 
defroster on for 5 minutes. 


INTERIOR AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR: The sensor includes the integral blower fan 
which continuously draws interior air over the sensor. This helps the system to stabilize the 
output of the system to match the desired settings on the control panel.

CHANGES TO 5 SERIES (E39) IHKA CONTROL PANEL 




The operation and appearanoe of the IHKA 
on the E39 as of 9/96 produotion has 
changed only slightly: 

On the LCD display the new “AUTO-symbol” 
replaced the fan symbol, indicating activation 
of the automatic blower speed program. 

The lit LED on the “AUTO-button” indicates 
activation of the automatic air distribution. 


I Note: 

From 9/96 to 3/97 Production: 

When in the automatic blower speed mode, the “AUTO- 
^ symbol” and the blower wedge silhouette will be displayed 



After 3/97 Production: 

When ih the automatic blower speed mode, the “AUTO- 
symbol” and the actual blower speed indicated by the bars, 
will be displayed. The number of bars will automatically 
change as the auto control of the blower takes place. 


If the plus or minus fan speed button is 
pressed when in the auto mode, the 
“AUTO-symbol” in the display will be 
turned off and the manual blower speed 
control takes place. Blower speed is 
indicated by the bars. 

At the same time the automatic air 
distribution program is still active and the 
LED in the “AUTO-button” will be: 








1. turned off - from 9/96 to 3/97 production 

2. turned on - after 3/97 production 



If one of the air distribution buttons is pressed when in the auto mode (1), the air distribution 
will come out of the automatic program, however, the automatic blower speed program will 
remain active and the “AUTO-symbol” will continue to be displayed in the LCD panel. 

NOTE: If the control module is replaced it must be coded.

OPERATION 


AIR VOLUME CONTROL 


The left side is positioned above the brake 
power booster and the right side above the 
power distribution/E box. 

The micro filters serve two functions, one is 
to filter out small dust and dirt particles. The 
second is to neutraiize unpleasant odors. 

This function is carried out by the active 
carbon fliter. 

Care must be taken when servicing the micro filters or moving them for access to other 
components. When reinstalling the filters, ensure that the seals are properly installed to 
prevent odors from entering the interior. 



Fresh air enters the IHKA system through the fresh air inlets mounted in the bulkhead area 
behind the engine. The air passes through the micro/activated carbon filters positioned on 
each side of the engine compartment.

The blower motor is oontrolled through an output stage that is mounted in a heat sink on 
the heater case. 


The control lead from the IHKA module supplies a varying voltage (2.0 to 8.0 VDC) based 
on the position of the blower control rocker switch. The blower speed increases through 
the 15 steps until 8 volts is supplied to the control lead. At this point (the 16th step), the 
blower is running at maximum speed. 


The speed of the blower fan is also 
influenced by the “Y” factor and 
degree of heating or cooling power 
requested. 

When the IHKA system is switched 
ON, the blower fan will come ON at a 
speed that is dependent on the “Y” 
factor and system settings. 

The battery charge condition also 
contributes to blower speed. When 
the battery drops below 12 volts, the 
blower speed signal to the blower 
output stage is reduced 
proportionately. Therefore a reduction 
in blower speed may be noticed. 

To switch the system OFF, the rocker 
switch must be stepped down to the 
lowest setting and then toggled OFF.

RAM AIR PRESSURE COMPENSATION 


The air volume entering the IHKA system is compensated for at higher vehicle speeds. This 
is carried out through the road speed dependent fresh air flap operation. 



In the fresh air mode, the 
flaps are open 100% up to a 
road speed of 
approximately 37 MPH at 
which point they are closed 
to 40%. 

When the vehicle speed 
reaches approximately 55 
MPH the flaps close to 30%. 

There is a hysteresis 
(overlap) built into the flap 
closing so that the flaps will 
not oscillate open/closed at 
one set speed.

TEMPERATURE REGULATION (HEATING) 


The IHKA E39 uses two separate heater cores for the driver and passenger sides. Each 
heater core is controlled by a pulsed water valve to regulate the flow of coolant, as on other 
IHKA systenns. The valves are powered closed and wide open when deactivated. The 
water valves are pulsed to regulate the tennperature based on the following inputs: 


• Left/right temperature settings • Left/right heater core temperatures 

• Outside temperature • Interior temperature • “Y” factor

The auxiliary water pump is used to ensure that a sufficient volume of coolant is available 
to the heater cores for all heating conditions. The auxiliary pump is also used to supply 
coolant for the “REST” feature of the IHKA. The auxiliary water pump is powered directly 
from the IHKA control module through a final stage output. 


There are individual maximum heat functions for the left/right side temperature control 
settings. At the maximum settings, temperature regulation is canceled and the water valves 
are 100% open to provide maximum heat. 


Correspondingly, the water valves are powered closed in the maximum cold position of the 
temperature control settings. 


11 























































































COLD START INTERLOCK 


Cold start interlock is active in the AUTO program with a driver’s side heater core 
temperature below 20°C. In this program, the defrost flaps are 100% open, the footwell 
and face vents are closed. The blower fan will run at the set speed. 

SERVICE STATION FEATURE 

This feature prevents hot coolant from entering the heater cores after the engine is switched 
OFF. It is designed to prevent a blast of hot air, on a restart, that would arise from coolant 
bleeding into the heater cores (heat surge) when the engine is switched OFF. 

If the coolant temperature is above 15°C, the water valves are powered closed for 3 
minutes when the vehicle is switched OFF. 

PARKED CAR VENTILATION 


The parked car ventilation feature of the E38 IHKA system is retained on the E39 IHKA 
system. The feature is only available with the High BO. The signal to activate the venting 
function is generated by the BC function of the IKE. The signal is passed over the K-Bus 
to the IHKA for fan and flap activation. 


The signal prompts the IHKA to open the face vent flaps to 100%. The blower relay is 
energized and the blower output stage is sent a 4 volt signal. The blower is run at 7 volts 
operating power to provide adequate venting. 


If battery voltage drops below 11.5 volts the function is 
cancelled.

REST FEATURE 


The interior of the vehicle can continue to be heated with the engine switched OFF using 
the REST feature of the IHKA. The feature is activated by pressing the REST button on the 
IHKA control panel. When activated, the auxiliary water pump and biower motor are 
switched on. This feature wiil remain active for up to 15 minutes or untii the coolant 
temperature drops below 30°C. 


Switching ON requirements for the 
REST feature include: 

• Ignition switched OFF or in KL R 

• Rest button pressed 

• Outside temperature <15°0 

• Ooolant temperature > 70°0 

• Battery voltage > 11.4 volts 

• Less than 15 minutes after ignition is 
switched OFF 


Switching OFF conditions for the REST 
feature include: 

• Ignition switched ON - KL15 

• Battery voltage < 11.4 volts 

• Rest button pressed while system is ON 

• Coolant temperature < 30°C 

• After 15 minutes time period.

A/C COMPRESSOR CONTROL 


Activation of the compressor clutch is an output control function of the IHKA module. As 
with the E38 IHKA, activation Is carried out direotly through a final stage In the module (no 
relay required). 

The signals KO and AC have been combined into one signal providing multiple data through 
a stepped Increase In signal duty cycle.

• 45% Duty Cycle: Snowflake button is pressed, the IHKA signals the 
engine oontrol module to raise the idle speed in preparation of the 
oompressor being switohed on. This takes plane before the IHKA 
energizes the oompressor. 


SIGNAL KOREL: 

The engine control module signals the IHKA (Signal KOREL) when the Idle Inorease has 
taken place and the IHKA will then activate the compressor olutch, as long as all other 
compressor requirements are satisfied. Compressor out off oonditions include: 


• Evaporator temperature below 2°C 

• Coolant temperature > 117°C - causes the compressor to run in a pulsed operation. 

• Coolant temperature > 120°C - the compressor clutoh Is deaotivated until the 
temperature drops below 11 7°C. 

• Full acceleration at low speeds - below 10 MPH with a full throttle input will oause 
the compressor to shut off for 10 seconds.

COMPRESSOR SIGNALING ‘99 MODEL YEAR 


For ‘99 Model Year, E39 IHKA now reoeives a variable input from the refrigerant pressure 
“sensor”. The sensor is mounted in the receiver/dryer. 

Based on the refrigerant pressure, the pressure sensor input allows the IHKA module to 
determine the “start up” torque of the A/C compressor. If the pressure is too low or high 
the compressor will be deactivated. The IHKA also anticipates the necessary auxiliary fan 
speed and passes this information on to the ECM via the K-bus. 

This change now removes the pressure sensor from the compressor activation circuit.

AUXILIARY FAN 


The auxiliary fan is a three stage operation as introduced on the 1996 E38. 


Stage 1: Activated simultaneously with the compressor with an ambient air temperature 

>10°C (50°F). If the coolant temperature rises to >91 °C the fan will also be 
switched on. Fan Speed = 1250 RPM. 

Stage 2: Activated when the medium pressure switch on the receiver/dryer closes at 17.5 

bar. Fan Speed = 2000 RPM. 


Stage 3: Activated when the coolant temperature reaches 104°C at the double 
temperature switch. The stage 3 switched voltage circuit is protected by a 50 
amp remote fuse (red). The fuse is located in the electrical carrier forward of the 
glove box.

AUXILIARY FAN CONTROL (‘99 MODEL YEAR - E39) 


The Auxiliary Fan motor inoorporates and 
output final stage that aotivates the fan 
motor at variable speeds. 

The auxiliary fan is controlled by ECM. The 
motor output stage receives power and 
ground and activates the motor based on a 
PWM signal (10-100 Hz) received from the 
ME 7.2. 


The fan is activated based on the following 
factors: 



FAN MOTOR MODULE 


POWER, GROUND & SIGNAL WIRES 


• Radiator outlet temperature sensor input exceeds a preset temperature. 

• IHKA signalling via the K and CAN bus based on calculated refrigerant pressures. 

• Vehicle speed 

• Battery voltage level 


When the over temperature light in the instrument dust is on (120°C) the fan is run in the 
overrun function. This signal is provided to the ECM via the CAN bus. When this occurs 
the fan is run at a frequency of 10 Hz.

M Bus with a micro processor on each motor. 


STRATIFIED AIR 


The stratified face vent function is adjusted with a bowden cable as on the E36 IHKA 
system. The stratified air output is only possible at the center face vents. The system 
operates the same as the stratification flap on the E36 - IHKA system. 

The cable manipulates the stratification flap in the IHKA housing allowing cold air to flow 
into the face vent air ducts mixing with heated air. 


18 































































































































































As of production 9/97 stratified air is available from the console rear outlet. 

This caused a housing change (similar to E38) and an additional stepper motor. 

The thumbwheel to the left of the outlet operates an on/off switch for airfiow control. 


Note: From production date 9/97 to 3/98 the rear compartment flap motor assumes the 
COLD position when the switch is ciosed. As from production date 03/98, the flap 
moves in the WARM direction in order to avoid draughts in the event of flap leaking. 


The consoie outlet is almost always open when 
the IHKA system is “on” and the rear seat 
passengers request air flow. An exception is 
during windshield defrosting (and maximum 
defrost mode) when the console outlet flap is fuily 
closed. 

The same flap and stepper motor, located on the 
IHKA E39 housing assembly, performs both the 
open/close and temperature control functions for 
the console outlet. 



• An additional thumbwheel to the right of the outlet allows rear seat passengers to vary 
air discharge temperature as well.

M BUS 

Each M-Bussed motor is connected through a ribbon cable that contains three wires

and addressed to a specific motor. All of the motor processors receive the signal, but only 
the addressed motor will respond and move to the desired position. 

Because of the unique address stored in the processor, all bussed motors have a unique 
part number and cannot be interchanged.

AUTOMATIC RECIRCULATED AIR CONTROL (AUC) 


AUC functions the same as on the E38. The AUC sensor is positioned on the driver’s side 
of the radiator shroud next to the radiator iniet hose. This iocation provides easy service 
access as well as an ideal position to monitor the levels of oxidizable gasses in the incoming 
air stream flowing through the radiator. 

The sensor is heated to its operating temperature by the IHKA module. If the level of gasses 
exceeds a set threshold value, the recirc flaps are automatically opened. 


When the level of noxious gasses drops, the fresh air flaps will again open. 


AUC is subject to time limits to prevent glass fogging: 

• 3 minute cycling when heating 

• 12 minute cycling when cooling

Diagnostic Software version 16.1 (DIS/MoDiC III) allows for the selection of “Car Memory” 
choices in E38 and E39s produced prior to 9/98 depending on the vehicle 
hardware/software status. “Key Memory” is not available for E38 and E39s produced prior 
to 9/98. 


“Car Memory” includes functions which are activated regardless of the vehicle key being used. 


“Key Memory” contains functions which can be 
different depending on the vehicle key used. The 

vehicle key is identified during “uniocking”, 
only when remote control is used (function are 
inoperative during “manual” unlocking). Up to 

four different keys for the E46, and two keys for the 
E38 and E39 can be customized (upon delivery, the 
customer Is provided with two remote control 
transmitters). 


These features are 
programmed using the 
coding/programming 
function of the 
DIS/MoDiC.

DIAGNOSIS 


The DIS tester and E39 software are used to troubleshoot and diagnose the IHKA systenn. 
The following displays and test programs are available, once the tester is connected and 
the diagnostic program is accessed: 


• Testing based on a fault symptom 

• Readout and testing based on the status iist displays 

• Simulation of outputs 

• Readout and display of stored faults 

• Testing/troubleshooting based on fault displays 

• Canceling of the fault memory

Replacement values are stored in the control module that will allow the IHKA system to 
continue to function when various sensors fail. Output faults result in the switching off of the 
failed output. 


The fault memory is contained in a non-volatile RAM so that any stored faults will not be 
canceled when the system is switched off or the battery is disconnected. A maximum of six 
faults can be stored in the fault memory.
