IHKA E36 COMPARED TO IHKA E38 


Beginning with the 1996 model year, a new IHKA system is installed on all E36 vehicles 
except the 318ti and Z3. Referred to as IHKA E36, it replaces the IHKR system previous¬ 
ly used on these vehicles. 

In comparison to previous IHKA systems, IHKA E36 is most similar to IHKA E38. IHKA E36, 
however, does not have many of the features found on IHKA E38. 

SIMILARITIES TO E38 IHKA 

• Combined control panel/module 

• Rocker switches for left/right desired temperature selection. 

• Digital LCD display of left/right desired temperatures. 

• Separate buttons to select windshield, face, or footwell air distribution. 

• “Auto” button that turns air distribution control over to the control panel/module. 

• “Smart” stepper motors operate all flaps except the fresh air flaps. 

• Fault codes stored in non-volatile memory (EEPROM). 

DIFFERENCES FROM E38 IHKA 

• There is only one desired blower speed input. 

• Eight distinct blower speeds are available. 

• Blower speed is shown on the digital LCD display. 

• No face vent air temperature sensors. 

• No auxiliary coolant pump. 

• Dedicated IHKA system ambient temperature sensor. 

• Engine control module controls the A/C compressor. 

• One set of air distribution buttons for both left and right sides. 

• No windshield or washer spray jet heaters. 

• Sensor values and other input status data can be displayed on the control 
panel/module. 

• No “Rest” function. 

• No console outlet rear flap.

IHKA E36 CONTROL PANEL/MODULE 



The E36 control panel and control module is integrated into one unit. IHKA E36 control 
panel/module features are listed below. 

NOTE: When the IHKA E36 system is “Off,” pressing any button on the control panel/mod¬ 
ule turns it on again. 

Air Distribution Buttons: The E36 control panel/module air 
distributions are the same as E38, except there is only 
one set of buttons, which control air distribution on both 
sides. 

If the “up arrow” button is pressed, air flows from the 
windshield defroster outlets. 


Pressing the “right arrow” button causes air to flow from 
the face vent outlets. 

When the “down arrow” is pressed, air flows from the 
footwell outlets (front and rear). 






AUTO 


1 


If the “AUTO” button is pressed, the control module 
automatically selects the appropriate flap positions for the 
sensed conditions. When cooling is required, air flows 
from the face vents. When heating is required, air flows 
from the footwells and the windshield defroster outlets. 


3 



























































LCD Display: The E36 control panel/module 
has a backlit LCD display where left and 
right desired temperatures and blower 
speed are shown. Display brightness varies 
according to ambient light levels when the 
headlamps and parking lamps are “off.” 
With the lamps “on,” brightness depends 
on dimming rheostat thumbwheel position.

Interior Temperature Sensor: As on all previous IHKA 
systems, an interior temperature sensor is located 
inside the control panel/module, also as on previous 
systems, the sensor has its own electric fan to ensure 
adequate air flow over the sensor. 

Photocell: The photocell, located just below the interior 
temperature sensor grille, monitors ambient light levels 
to influence LCD display brightness (as on E38s). 

Temperature Selection Rocker Switches: The tempera¬ 
ture selection rocker switches (left and right), function 
the same as those on E38 vehicles. 

Blower Rocker Switch: Blower speed is selected using 
a rocker switch. Speed is increased by pressing the 
“+” end of the switch and decreased by pressing the 
” end. 

When the system is at the lowest blower speed (speed 
“1”), pressing the end turns the system “Off.” 

Maximum Defrosting Button: This button functions the 
same as the one on E38, except that the mixing flaps 
are not affected (they are cable operated). When 
pressed: 

• the fresh air flaps are opened and 

• the recirc. flaps are closed and 

• the windshield defrost flaps are opened and 

• all other distribution flaps are closed and 

• the blower runs at maximum speed and 

• the rear window defroster switches on. 


4 


The A/C compressor does not turn on automatically, 
but will run if the “snowflake” button is pressed. 







































A/C Compressor “snowflake” Button: Pressing the 
“snowflake” button causes the control panel/module to 
signal the engine control module (ECM) that A/C com¬ 
pressor operation is desired. 

The ECM then energizes a relay to run the compressor. 

Recirculating Air Button: This button controls air intake 
location as on previously covered IHKA systems. 

On IHKA E36, though, recirculating air mode has no 
time limit. Once activated, it continues until the button 
is pressed again. 

Rear Window Defroster Button: Pressing the rear win¬ 
dow defroster button activates the rear window heating 
for about 17 minutes.

IHKA E36 CONTROL PANEL/MODULE FUNCTIONS 


The control panel/module handles all the functions necessary to operate the IHKA system: 


Blower speed 

Auxiliary cooling fan 

Air intake flaps (fresh/recirculating) 

Air distribution flaps (face vent, foot 

well, defroster) 


Heater core temperatures 
Evaporator temperature 
Special programmed functions 
Rear window defrost timing 


And, like the E38 control panel/module, the E36 version has an EEPROM for fault code 
storage. The module can go into “sleep mode” to reduce power consumption when the 
ignition is switched “off,” but still retain control panel settings and fault code information. 


Another feature, unique to the E36 control panel/module, is that temperature sensor read¬ 
ings, “Y-factor” values, software version and other information can be displayed on the 
panel face for diagnosis. Refer to “Special Functions” later in this Handout for more infor¬ 
mation. 


NOTE: If the control module is replaced it must be coded. 

SUBSTITUTE VALUE OPERATION 


If an input potentiometer or sensor (or its circuit) fails, the control panel/module will ignore 
the faulty input and, in its place, use a replacement value which has been programmed into 
its memory for just this purpose. The replacement value, typically a mid-scale value for a 
particular input, allows the system to operate as normally as possible, despite the fault. 


Substitute values for IHKA E36 components are: 

• Desired temperature value (left or right) .72°F (22°C) 

• Interior temperature sensor.75°F (24°C) 

• Heater core temperature sensor (left or right).130°F(55°C) 

• Evaporator temperature sensor.23°F (-5°C)* 

• Ambient temperature sensor.32°F (CPC) 


* The substitute value for the evaporator temperature sensor is significantly below the 
A/C compressor cycling point (1 -3°C). Therefore, if the evaporator temperature sen¬ 
sor signal is not plausible, the substitute value will switch the refrigeration system off.

Like IHKA E38, IHKA E36 uses an M-Bus to control all stepper motors except the fresh air 
flaps stepper motor. IHKA E36, however, uses only five stepper motors: 

• Fresh air flaps (conventional) 

• Recirculating air flaps (smart) 

• Defroster flaps (smart) 

• Face vent flaps (smart) 

• Footwell flaps (smart) 

The fresh air flaps stepper motor is connected to the control panel/module by four circuits. 
The “smart” stepper motors are all linked together and receive their positioning commands 
over the M-bus.

IHKA E36 REAR WINDOW DEFROSTER 


Rear window defroster operation on E36 vehicles is not influenced by ambient temperature, 
as it is on E38 vehicles. 

Pressing the rear window defroster button turns on the defroster and it operates for 17 min¬ 
utes. The defroster then shuts off automatically. 

Refer to the IHKA E36 IPO on page 98 for a defroster schematic.

T ▼ 

WATER OUTLET 


Temperature regulation is accomplished the same way as on the IHKA systems already 
covered: 

• solenoid actuated water valves control the flow of hot coolant through the heater cores 

• the valves, sprung open, are powered closed by the control panel/module in response 
to sensed inputs and buttons pressed on control panel/module face. 


An important difference from IHKA 
E31, and E38 is that IHKA E36 does 
not use an electric pump to boost 
coolant flow through the heater 
cores. Instead, the control 
panel/module monitors engine 
speed and compensates for low 
flow at lower engine speeds by 
increasing water valve “open” time. 



11 





























































































































































IHKA E36 TEMPERATURE MIXING 


The temperature mixing flap is 
mechanically actuated, using the 
thumbwheel at the bottom left cor¬ 
ner of the center face vent. 



MIXING FLAP CONTROL 


Any time that the face vents are open, rotating the thumbwheel will operate the mixing flap 
which is located above the space between the evaporator and the heater cores. Opening 
the mixing flap allows more cooled air to enter the face vent ductwork. Closing the flap 
increases the proportion of heated air which enters the face vent ductwork.

IHKA E36 AIR INTAKE 



FRESH AIR FLAP 
STEPPER MOTOR 


The fresh air flaps stepper motor operates only when the ignition switch is in “Run.” At 
engine shut-down, the fresh air flaps stay in their “last-used” position. When the ignition 
switch is again turned to “Run,” the control module/panel operates the stepper motor to 
move the flaps, if necessary. 


When open, the flaps are positioned 
according to road speed; the flaps 
close incrementally with every 12.5 
mph change in road speed (to pre¬ 
vent the flaps from continually open¬ 
ing and closing due to slight 
changes in speed). At 85 mph the 
fresh air flaps are only 20% to 40% 
open (depending on blower speed). 

In the recirculating air mode, the 
fresh air flaps are 20% open.

IHKA E36 BLOWER CONTROL 


IHKA E36 blower control is most similar to that of IHKA E31 since a separate final stage 
unit is mounted on the housing assembly. E36, however, offers eight discrete speeds. 



The control panel/module processes the blower speed rocker switch input and sends a sig¬ 
nal to the final stage unit. The final stage unit then regulates blower motor voltage to con¬ 


The blower rocker switch is the master controller for the IHKA sys¬ 
tem as it can be used to switch the system “Off.” This is done by 
lowering blower speed to the lowest speed and then pressing the “- 
” button one more time: 

• The blower motor turns off and 

• All flaps are closed and 

• All function LEDs and the LCD display are switched off and 

• The rear window defroster is switched off and 

• The A/C compressor is switched off. 

The interior temperature sensor blower continues to operate, though, and the control 
panel/module pulses the appropriate water valve if either left or right desired temperature is 
above the sensed interior temperature. 

The IHKA E36 system can be turned “on” again by pressing any button on the control 
panel/module face.

When A/C is requested (by pressing the “snowflake”), the IHKA control panel/module sends 
a request signal to the engine control module. 

If A/C refrigerant pressures are within limits, the engine control module stabilizes engine idle 
and determine whether or not to energize the A/C compressor clutch (by grounding the 
compressor control relay).

The auxiliary fan can be turned on by: 

• A request from the IHKA control panel/module (normal speed operation). 

• High refrigerant pressure (high-speed operation). 

• High coolant temperature (normal or high-speed operation). 

6- and 4-cylinder engines have different circuits. On 6-cylinder engines, the IHKA control 
panel/module circuit used to request A/C compressor operation is also used to energize 
the auxiliary fan normal speed relay. On 4-cylinder engines, the engine control module 
grounds the relay. 

On 6-cylinder engines, the coolant temperature switch activates the normal speed relay. 
On 4-cylinder engines, the coolant temperature switch signals the engine control module 
that the coolant is too hot, and the engine control module activates the relay.

SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 


Control Panel/Module Test Display (12-95 to 3-97 production) 

The E36 IHKA control panel/module includes additional programming that allows system 
diagnosis without the use of the DIS or MoDiC; sensor values and other inputs are shown 
on the LCD display. This function is found on systems produced from 12-95 thru 3-97.

Note: The control panel/module LED display does not include a decimal point or percent 
symbol, so 99.5% is displayed as 995. 

Temperatures are always shown in degrees Celsius, regardless of module coding. 

Blower speed cannot be adjusted during sensor display mode. 

Service-Station Feature 

This service station feature continues on IHKA E36. The control panel/module continues to 
power both coolant valves closed for about 3 minutes after the ignition is switched “Off.” 
This feature prevents the heater cores from being flooded with hot coolant when the engine 
is shut off for brief periods (e.g. during refueling). 

Cold Start Arrest 

IHKA E36 also includes an automatically activated cold start arrest function. The control 
panel/ module checks for the necessary conditions at engine start-up: 

• IHKA system turned “on” and 

• Maximum defrosting request is not present and 

• Left Y-factor is 100% (maximum heating required) and 

• Left side “AUTO” mode request is present and 

• Left heater core temperature is less than 68°F (20°C). 

If these conditions exist, the control panel/module will: 

• Open the defroster flaps and 

• Close all other air distribution flaps and 

• Operate the blower motor, A/C compressor, fresh air flaps, and recirc. air flaps 

according to control panel/module settings. 

When the left heater core temperature reaches 68°F (20°C), cold start arrest ends and all 
IHKA system functions depend upon control panel/module settings and sensed conditions. 

Calibration Run 

The control panel/module initiates a “calibration run” every 20th time the ignition switch is 
turned to “Off.” The calibration run is necessary because the stepper motors move relative 
to the end-of-travel position (0% or 100%). 


19 





CONTROL PANEL/MODULE CODING 



The IHKA control panel/module is coded with the central coding key (ZCS) using the DIS 
or MoDiC. The ZCS coding procedures is the same as on previous systems. 

After coding a new or replacement control module, disconnect it from the battery com¬ 
pletely (unplug the control module from the vehicle wiring harness) for a minimum of 10 sec¬ 
onds. This allows the new coding data to overwrite any previous coding data.
