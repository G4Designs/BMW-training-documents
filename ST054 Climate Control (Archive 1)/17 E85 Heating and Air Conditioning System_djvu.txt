E85 Heating / Air Conditioning System 

Purpose of the System 

This module describes the heating and air conditioning systems of the Z4. A differentiation 
is made between (depending on how the vehicle is equipped): 

• Integrated heating and air conditioning control - IHKS 

• Integrated automatic heating and climate control - IHKA 

Compared to the predecessor (Z3), the optional IHKA including automatic recirculating air 
control AUC is a unique feature in the roadster. 

In both variants, the control panel consists of three control zones each with a rotary knob. 
These are elevated from the instrument panel like "islands" to underscore the sporty char¬ 
acteristics and enhance the high grade appearance of the roadster. The rotary knobs fea¬ 
ture precision adjustment and rotary function lighting. 

Various function buttons that differ depending on IHKS/IHKA are integrated in the center 
"island." 

Advantages at a glance: 

• Sporty and high grade control panel appearance. 

• The island design provides clearly arranged and easy to use controls. 

• Precision adjustment for air distribution, blower speed and temperature setting. 

• Common parts concept implemented to a large extent. 

• No water shut-off valve and auxiliary water pump due to airbased control. 


IHKS System Components 


The IHKS system consists of following components: 

• IHKS control panel/control module • Evaporator temperature sensor 


• IHKS heater/air conditioner unit 

• Refrigerant pressure sensor 


• A/C compressor 

• Rear window defogger relay

The rotary knob for air distribution (adjustment range of 360° rotation) features 3 rough set¬ 
tings and 9 fine settings. 


The rotary knob for blower control (adjustment range of 104° rotation) provides the follow¬ 
ing setting options:

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 






















The stepper motor for the air distribution and for adjusting the 3 air distribution flaps is 
mounted directly behind the cam disc. The Control module activates the stepper motor 
(corresponding to the required position) when the rotary control for air distribution is oper¬ 
ated. 


The cam disc moves the air distribution flaps by “central kinematics”. The actual position of 
the cam disc and stepper motor is detected by 2 small cams of different width that activate 
a microswitch. This microswitch provides feedback to the IHKS Control Module which cor¬ 
responds to the air distribution flaps and their positions. 


1. Microswitch 

2. Narrow cam 

3. Wide cam 




After KL15 is switched “OFF” and a sleep mode of 10 minutes, the flaps are moved to the 
following end positions: 

• Defrost flap dependent on outside temperature 
> 10°C CLOSED (50 °F), 

< 10 °C OPEN (50 °F) 

• Ventilation flap CLOSED 

• Footwell flap CLOSED 

A calibration run is carried out in the event of a system fault (e.g. implausible position of cam 
disc) to redetermine the position of the cam disc. The cam disc is moved until a cam trips 
the microswitch. Based on this position, a set position is specified and set in the control 
module. 


7 

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 




A cam measurement (reference run) takes place the first time the control panel/control 
module is operated after: 


• Replacing the control panel/control module 

• Replacing the cam disc 

• Interruption in power supply 

During this reference run, the length and distances of both cams with respect to each other 
are measured and stored in the control module. A fault code is stored if cam referencing 
cannot be concluded successfully after 3 attempts. In this case, adjustment of the central 
kinematics for air distribution is possible only within restricted limits. 


IHKS Principle of Operation 
Blower 

When KL15 is switched “ON”, the blower is activated in linear progression from 0 to 8 Volts 
(depending on the selected blower speed). When the blower is switched “OFF” (zero posi¬ 
tion) the IHKS is deactivated in addition to the following: 

• Blower switched off 

• Fresh air/recirculating air flap closed 

• Mixed air flap closed (to ensure the heat exchanger does not unnecessarily heat up the 
heater/air conditioner) 

• Compressor switched off 

Note: Rear window defogger can still be activated

4. Stepper motor, mixed air flap 



8 

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 




Warm and cold air are mixed for temperature control. The requested temperature is set by 
the rotary knob on the control panel/control unit. The outlet temperature is set by a step¬ 
per motor coupled to the mixed air flap. 

The temperature is controlled by mixing: 

• Outside air that flows through the evaporator = cold air 

• Outside air that initially flows through the evaporator and then through the heat exchang¬ 
er (reheat) = warm air 

Note: Changes in engine rpm do not trigger any temperature adjustments. 


Air Distribution 

The individual setting for the air distribution is requested with the rotary knob on the con¬ 
trol panel. The main flap settings are: 


"Defrost" 

"Ventilation" 

"Footwell" 


The central kinematics stepper motor adjusts the cam disc for air distribution. 

Notes:

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 




Air Volume Control 

The air volume is controlled based on the position of the fresh air/recirculating air flap and 
blower speed. There is 1 flap at the fresh air inlet and 2 flaps for recirculating air control. 
The actuator for the fresh air/recirculating air flap adjusts these 3 individual flaps by a cou¬ 
pling linkage. 

The system assumes recirculating air mode after pressing the recirculating air button. The 
fresh air inlet is closed and the recirculating air channel opened. The actuator for the fresh 
air/recirculating air flap is not a stepper motor. Its position is determined based on the acti¬ 
vation of 4 phases. 


Notes:

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 



IHKA 


Compared to the IHKS, the integrated automatic heating and climate control (IHKA) offers 
the advantage of automatic adaptation for: 

• Air volume control 

• Temperature control 

• Air distribution control 

These control functions are calculated by the IHKA control module from the inputs, char¬ 
acteristic curves and monitored via temperature sensors. The IHKA in the E85 differs from 
the previous BMW systems (digital displays) in that it features an analogue control panel. 

Special functions such as Defrost, Fresh air/AUC/recirculating air etc. are also controlled by 
the IHKA control module. The IHKA control panel and control module form one component. 

IHKA System Components 

The IHKA consists of following components: 

• Control panel/control module 

• Heater/air conditioner unit 

• AUC sensor 

• A/C compressor 

• Refrigerant pressure sensor 

• Rear window defogger relay 

Note: The solar sensor is not available on the E85 IHKA system.

The 3 control elements of the control panel/control unit are enclosed by trim rings. These 
trim rings are clipped into the instrument panel from the front and can be replaced sepa¬ 
rately. 

The rotary knob for air distribution (adjustment range of 360° rotation) features 3 main set¬ 
tings and 10 precision settings in between. 

The rotary knob for blower speed (adjustment range of 180° rotation) features 1 main notch 
for the zero setting. There are 14 precision settings from the zero position up to the maxi¬ 
mum setting. 

The rotary knob for temperature setting (adjustment range of 240° rotation) has 2 main set¬ 
tings (maximum cold/maximum warm) with 23 precision settings in between. Temperature 
setting range: 

• Maximum cold (corresponds to 60 °F) 

• Individual temperature setting range (in steps of 1 °F) 

• Maximum warm (corresponds to 84 °F) 

The following buttons feature a green function light (LED): AUTO, A/C, MAX AC. The but¬ 
ton for AUC/recirculating air has 2 green function lights (LEDs). 

The rear window defogger and defrost buttons feature an orange colored function light 
(LED). When the vehicle lights are switched on, the indicator lights are activated via termi¬ 
nal 58g. The signal comes from the light switch center (LSZ). 

The locator lights and function lights are dimmed corresponding to the dimmer control 
wheel position on the light switch center and/or depending on the ambient light conditions 
(photocell in light switch center). 


Rotating function light 

A special feature of the IHKA is the rotary function light in all three knobs. For example; the 
rotary knob for air distribution has an adjustment range of 360° rotation. 8 LEDs are locat¬ 
ed on the pc-board (under the knob) at its circumference to ensure it can be seen clearly 
from different viewing directions. 

A light element is located in the rotary knob (connected mechanically) and turns together 
with it. 


14 

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 



The light element functions as a light guide. It bundles the light of the LEDs and, due to its 
geometrical shape, guides it to the light outlet window of the rotary knob. 


This ensures the full light intensity 
is always emitted at the light out¬ 
let window.

Interior Temperature Sensor 

A ventilated interior temperature sensor is located in the IHKA control panel. The integrat¬ 
ed sensor blower is activated when KL15 is switched “ON”. The sensor blower continues 
to run for 10 minutes after KL15 is switched “OFF”. 


1. Rotary knob, blower setting 

2. Interior temperature sensor grill opening 

3. Interior temperature sensor (pc-board 
mounted NTC) 


The afterrunning period is neces¬ 
sary to keep the interior tempera¬ 
ture reading “fresh”. 

Otherwise, when the vehicle is parked for a short period of time (e.g. refuelling), due to inte¬ 
rior heat build up, the sensor would supply an incorrect value for the interior temperature. 

15 

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 





The vehicle interior temperature sensor has a value range from -49 °F to 176 °F. The eval¬ 
uation range of the vehicle interior temperature sensor is between 41 °F and 122 °F. Values 
below -49 °F are stored as a short to B+ or a break. Values above 176 °F are stored as a 
short to B-. The substitute value is 68 °F. 

The sensor blower is not monitored. In the event of a fault, this will influence the tempera¬ 
ture control (regulation). An implausible temperature value may be supplied when the vehi¬ 
cle interior heats up. 


IHKA Heater/Air Conditioner 

The following components are integrated in the IFHKA heater/air conditioner: 

• Actuator, fresh air/recirculating air flap • Stepper motor, mixed air flap 

• Stepper motor, air distribution, bottom • Temperature sensor, mixed air 

• Stepper motor, air distribution, center • Blower output final stage and blower motor 

• Stepper motor, air distribution, top • Evaporator temperature sensor

Stepper Motors 

The number of steps of the individual stepper motors depends on the adjustment range of 
the driven flap as follows: 

• Defrost, maximum number of steps 900, fail safe direction flap open 

• Center ventilation, maximum number of steps 1390, fail safe direction flap closed 

• Footwell, maximum number of steps 1600, fail safe direction flap closed 

• Mixed air flap, maximum number of steps 1770, fail safe direction maximum warm 

The flaps are moved to their limit stops after KL15 is switched “OFF”. The stepper motors 
are not able to detect their actual position. The stepper motors always move relative to a 
reference point. A flap end position (0% or 100%) serves as this reference point. 


Evaporator Temperature Sensor 

The evaporator temperature sensor is installed on the heater/air conditioner to measure the 
temperature of the air flowing out at the evaporator. 

The evaporator temperature sensor has a maximum value range from -49 °F to 214 °F. The 
evaluation range of the evaporator temperature sensor is between 23 °F and 77 °F. Values 
below -49 °F are stored as a short to B+ or a break. Values above 214 °F are stored as a 
short to B-. The substitute value is 32 °F. 


Mixed Air Temperature Sensor 

A mixed air temperature sensor is installed on the heater/air conditioner after the mixed air 
flap to measure the mixed air temperature. 

The mixed air temperature sensor has a value 
range from -40 °F to 221 °F. 

Values below -40 °F are stored as a short to B+ 
or a break. 

Values above 221 °F are stored as a short to 
B-. The substitute value is 131 °F.

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 



Blower 


The radial blower in the Z4 is mounted transversely in the heater/air conditioner. The blow¬ 
er is activated when KL15 is switched “ON”, corresponding to the function previously 
selected (DEFROST, MAX AC, automatic blower function, individual blower setting). 

Blower activation takes place in linearly from 0 to 8 Volts. The IHKA is deactivated when the 
blower is switched “OFF” (zero position). The blower activation is infinitely variable in AUTO 
mode. The following 5 settings are possible for blower activation: 

• Blower “OFF” (zero position) 

• Individual blower setting 

• Automatic blower (AUTO mode) 

• DEFROST/MAX AC function with automatic blower setting 

• DEFROST/MAX AC function with individual blower setting 


AUC Sensor 

In automatic recirculating air control (AUC 
mode), pollutant gasses are detected by the 
AUC sensor. Based on this input, the IHKA 
decides whether the system is to assume fresh 
air mode or recirculating air mode. 

The AUC sensor requires a warm up phase of 
90 seconds. The AUC sensor is located on the 
intake shroud of the electric cooling fan (1). 



A/C Compressor 

The magnetic clutch for the A/C 
compressor is activated directly 
by the IHKA control module. 


1. A/C button on the IHKA control panel/ 
control module 

2. A/C compressor 



18 

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 





Air conditioning mode is activated by pressing the A/C button. The ECM is signalled to 
increase the idle speed to compensate for the compressor load. On receiving the "A/C 
compressor ON" request from the IHKA control module, the ECM responds with an enable 
signal on a separate control wire providing no full load cutout request is active. 
Consequently, the IHKA control module activates the A/C compressor magnetic clutch. 

Switching conditions for the A/C compressor magnetic clutch: 

A/C Compressor “ON” 

• A/C button pressed and 

• Evaporator temperature > 2 °C (depending on outside temperature) and 

• Outside temperature > - 10 °C and 

• System voltage > 9.7 V and 

• Permissible refrigerant pressure range 

A/C Compressor “OFF’ 

• Evaporator temperature < -0.5 °C (depending on outside temperature) or 

• Blower “OFF” (zero position) or 

• Outside temperature < -10 °C or 

• KL15 switched “OFF” or 

• System voltage <9 V or 

• Refrigerant pressure out of range (too low/high) 

The current "Air conditioning ON" function is stored in the IHKA when KL15 is switched 
“OFF”. Derived from the key memory (personalization), the function last selected is activat¬ 
ed when KL15 is switched “ON”. 


Pressure Monitoring 

The pressure in the refrigerant circuit is monitored by a pressure sensor. The anticipated 
A/C compressor load when switching on during operation is derived from the pressure sen¬ 
sor signal. 

The load torque in transferred via the K-bus and PT-CAN bus to the ECM. The ECM 
responds by adapting air and fuel volume. An upper and lower switching threshold is 
defined for pressure monitoring: 


Low Pressure 

High Pressure 

OFF <1.5 bar 

OFF >32.0 bar 

ON > 2.0 bar 

ON < 24.0 bar 


19 

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 











The pressure sensor is fitted in the pressure line near 
the receiver/dryer. The supply voltage is 5 V and the 
current is < 20 mA. 

Depending on the system pressure, it supplies the 
IHKA control module with an analog signal between 
0.4 V and 4.6 V. 



Rear Window Defogger 

The rear window defogger has 3 operating statuses. Relay 1 for the rear window defogger 
is always activated as if a hardtop were installed (no hardtop detection). 

Defrost Phase is started only after the first time the rear window defogger button is pressed 
after KL15 is switched “ON” (see following table for duration). Relay 2 for the rear window 
defogger is activated at a rate of 100%. The system then assumes cyclic switching mode. 

Cyclic Switching takes place with one third of the total power output of the rear window 
defogger (pulse/pause ratio = 40 seconds ON/80 seconds OFF). Cyclic switching is deac¬ 
tivated when KL15 is switched “OFF”. 

Restart is possible if the rear window does not remain clear during or after cyclic switching. 
The full power output can be resumed by pressing the rear window defogger button again. 
The reheating phase is again followed by cyclic switching.

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 
























Rear Window Defogger Undervoltage/Overvoltage Monitoring 

To prevent discharge when the vehicle electrical system is subject to high load at low engine 
speeds (< 1500 rpm), the rear window defogger relays are switched off when the voltage 
level drops or in the event of overvoltage (> 16 Volt for 5 seconds). 

If the system voltage at the IHKA drops below 11.4 Volts, the rear window defogger is 
switched off and only switched on again when the system voltage exceeds 12.2 Volts. The 
threshold values must be applied for longer than 10 seconds. 

Switching off the relays when undervoltage/overvoltage is detected has no influence on the 
duration of the operating statuses (defrost phase, cyclic switching, restart) and the function 
light (LED) remains on while the relays are switched off. 

The rear window defogger is also switched off during engine start up (K-bus message, 
KL50). 


IHKA Principle of Operation 
AUTO Mode 

The following examples will be observed when operating the air distribution and the blow¬ 
er controls: 

• A high blower speed is set manually by the blower knob. 

• When AUTO mode is selected, as the result of the previous manual setting, the rotary 
knob is still set to high. 

• Due to AUTO mode, the blower runs at medium speed. 

• If the blower output is now to be increased slightly by turning the knob to the right, a very 
large change occurs with the blower output. 


Automatic Temperature Control 

The temperature is controlled by mixing: 

• Outside air that flows through the evaporator = cold air 

• Outside air that initially flows through the evaporator and then through the heat exchang¬ 
er (reheat) = warm air 


21 

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 



While mixing the air, the IHKA temperature control determines a set position for the mixed 
air flap to maintain the requested interior temperature. This set position is determined from 
the inputs of: 

• Vehicle interior temperature sensor 

• Temperature sensor, mixed air 

• Evaporator temperature sensor 

The outside temperature and the coolant temperature are also used (transferred via K-bus 
from the instrument cluster). 


Automatic Air Distribution Control 

There are 2 setting options for the air distribution: 

• Individual setting of the air distribution 

• Automatic air distribution (AUTO button) 



The function light in the rotary knob for air distribution goes out when the AUTO button is 
pressed. The IHKA control module sets the optimum air distribution corresponding to var¬ 
ious inputs. Automatic blower mode remains active if the air distribution rotary knob is 
turned manually during automatic air distribution. The function light in the AUTO button 
goes out. 


22 

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 




Automatic Air Volume Control 

The air volume is controlled based on the position of the fresh air/recirculating air flap and 
the blower speeds. The fresh air/recirculating air flap (a total of 3 individual flaps) is pow¬ 
ered by an actuator. 

The recirculating air mode is activated by pressing the AUC/recirculating air button. The 
fresh air inlet is closed and the recirculating air channel opened. Air volume control features 
a dynamic pressure compensation function. 

The automatic blower and flap function as well as the function LED "AUTO" is activated by 
pressing the AUTO button. The IHKA control unit sets the optimum blower speed and posi¬ 
tion of the fresh air/recirculating air flap depending on various inputs. 


Special Functions 
MAX AC 

The MAX AC function allows the user to request maximum cooling capacity with the sim¬ 
ple push of a button. The prerequisite is that the outside temperature is > 50 °F. The MAX 
AC function is deactivated by pressing another button or turning a rotary knob. 

In the MAX AC function, the blower speed can be adjusted 
manually without exiting the MAX AC function. When ending 
the MAX AC function, the settings that were active before MAX 
AC are resumed. 

The A/C compressor remains switched on after ending the 
MAX AC function. Exception: The A/C compressor is switched 
off when the MAX AC function is switched off via the A/C but¬ 
ton. 



DEFROST 

Under certain circumstances the windows can fog up while driving (high humidity levels in 
the vehicle interior). The DEFROST function can quickly remedy this situation by preventing 
misting of the front field of vision. The DEFROST function assumes a higher ranking role in 
air distribution control. 


23 

E85 Heating/Air Conditioning System 




The DEFROST function can be activated as required even when IHKA is switched off (blow¬ 
er zero position). The blower runs at full power. The blower output can be adjusted manu¬ 
ally in DEFROST mode. 


If KL15 is switched “OFF” with the DEFROST function active, 
the DEFROST function is activated again KL15 is switched 
“ON” within the afterrunning period (10 minutes). 

The defrost function is deactivated by pressing another button 
or turning a rotary knob. When ending the DEFROST function, 
the settings that were active before DEFROST are resumed. 



AUC/Recirculating Air 

Automatic recirculating air control (AUC) is a standard feature 
on E85 vehicles with IHKA. Initially, the AUC function is acti¬ 
vated when the AUC/recirculating air button is pressed in fresh 
air mode. 


Pressing the button again activates the recirculating air mode. 

Pressing the button once again returns to fresh air mode. 

Recirculating air mode and AUC mode are indicated by green 
function lights (LEDs) on the control panel. 

As was the case with previous heating/air conditioning systems, the AUC/recirculating air 
function also features "forced ventilation with fresh air," the activation and duration of which 
depends on whether the system is in A/C mode (compressor active). The fresh air is already 
dehumidified if the A/C compressor is ON, therefore, the duration of recirculating air mode 
is longer.

Cold Start Interlock 


The cold start interlock function intervenes in activation of the air distribution flaps and 
blower control. The cold start interlock is active at low outside temperatures and low 
coolant temperatures (engine cold) to prevent cold air distribution until warm air is available. 

In the E85, the cold start interlock is not deactivated by a terminal change from KL15 “ON” 
to “OFF”. When the switch on conditions are fulfilled, the defrost air distribution flap is fully 
opened and the ventilation and footwell air distribution flaps are completely closed. As a 
result, no cold air is blown directly at the driver/passenger. 

The automatic blower function must be selected for intervention in blower control. 


Cooling Mode 

Cooling mode serves the purpose of cooling a heated vehicle by forced air recirculation at 
high outside temperatures. Cooling mode is active during engine start and applies both in 
AUTO mode and manual mode. The A/C compressor must also be activated. 

Cooling mode supersedes the AUC function. If the signal from the AUC sensor specifies 
fresh air mode, recirculating air mode is retained or set to a fresh air share of 20% when 
cooling mode is active. 

An E85 feature is that cooling mode is extended from 12 to 15 minutes in tropics coding 
(hot country). When the control variable (y-factor) is below -90%, the fresh air/recirculating 
air flap is set to recirculating air for maximum 12 minutes. As a result, warm air is not blown 
directly at the driver/passenger. 

After this period of 12 minutes has elapsed, if the control variable is below -90%, the fresh 
air/recirculating air flap is set to 20% fresh air. 


Avoiding Fogging During Start 

This function is activated once with KL15 “ON” in automatic mode. The prerequisite is that 
the outside temperature is above 32 °F. The defrost air distribution flap is closed for 12 sec¬ 
onds. Consequently, windshield fogging caused by moist air from the evaporator is avoid¬ 
ed. 

This function is superseded by the cold start interlock. In this case, all air distribution flaps 
are closed.

Dynamic Pressure Compensation 

To prevent uneven air volume as driving speeds vary, dynamic pressure is compensated by 
the fresh air flap reducing the fresh air inlet opening as the vehicle speed increases. The 
vehicle speed is made available via the K-bus from the instrument cluster. The fresh air flap 
reduces the opening angle within a certain speed range according to a characteristic curve. 
The calculation of the flap position is dampened to avoid continual flap activation as a result 
of variations in vehicle speed.

angle 


2. Vehicle speed 



Electric Cooling Fan 


The electric cooling fan is activated by the ECM that outputs the control voltage for the final 
stage of the fan. Activation for the correct fan speed (15 speeds) is derived by the IHKA 
control module from the refrigerant pressure sensor signal and sent to the ECM.

Workshop Hints 



Transport Mode 



To preserve the vehicle battery during vehicle transport, IHKA is deactivated. Transport 
mode is set during vehicle production and must be disabled prior to vehicle delivery. 
Transport mode is deactivated with the DISplus/GTI under Service Function "Disable trans¬ 
port mode." 


AUC Test Mode 

Differing from the E46, there is no button combination provided on the control panel that 
enables a test mode for AUC. 


Compressor Run-In Protection 

Compressor run-in protection is started automatically after installing a new control panel/ 
control module (important for initial assembly at the factory). The switch on conditions for 
the compressor, e.g. the outside temperature, are disregarded. 

Note: This function has a duration of 90 seconds (with engine running at idle speed). The 
function light in the A/C button flashes during this period.

Coding 


Tropics coding IHKA - The recirculating air function is retained after a new start. In addition, 
a previously selected recirculating air function is reactivated when the defrost function is 
switched off. In both cases, the tropics coding prevents moist warm air from the outside 
flowing into the vehicle interior. 

Hot country coding IHKA - In the hot country coding, the increased cooling capacity is 
achieved by increasing the blower output. 

Control panel/control unit coding - The function light on the button for the rear window 
defogger flashes if the control panel/control unit is not encoded. For instance, right-hand 
drive or left-hand drive must be coded for activation of the stepper motors to ensure the 
correct bus addresses are used.

Control Panel/Control Module Mounting 

The “island” design requires a different mounting concept. The control panel/control mod¬ 
ule is mounted from the rear in the instrument panel. 3 trim rings can be individually 
replaced from the front. The control panel/control module is secured by 2 side clips and 2 
screws at the top. 

The IHKS control panel/control module can only be replaced as a complete unit. Individual 
parts such as rotary knobs cannot be replaced. To remove this, it is first necessary to 
remove the center fresh air grille outlet and the radio. The control panel/control module can 
then be removed by pulling down through the service opening in the instrument panel. 


Note: Particular care must be 
taken when removing the control 
panel/control module to avoid 
scratches on the front of the unit.

panel/control module. 

2. Service opening for the control 
panel/control module. 



Heater/Air Conditioner Mounting 

The heater/air conditioner is 
mounted by 4 mounting domes 
on the support tube between the 
A pillars. 

The heater/air conditioner is 
secured by 4 plastic screws. The 
plastic screws can be reused sev¬ 
eral times. Repair kits for the 
mounting domes are available.

1. What are the “visual” differences that identify IHKA from IHKS? 


2. How are 3 sets of distribution flaps controlled by one stepper motor on the IHKS sys¬ 
tem? 

3. Where is the microfilter accessed for service? 

4. If the interior temperature sensor blower failed, what would be the customer complaint 
(IHKA)? 

5. What occurs with the A/C compressor when MAX AC is switched off (IHKA)? 

6. What is Transportation Mode?
