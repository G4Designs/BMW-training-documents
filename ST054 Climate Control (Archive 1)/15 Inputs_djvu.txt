POWER AND GROUND INPUTS 


Constant battery power supply (KL30) is neoessary for IHKA operation as well as memory 
(early systems). 

For the “battery draw test” see the repair manual referring to 16 minute “sleep” mode. 

Switohed ignition power (KL15) is required for IHKA operation when the ignition is in the 
“run” position. This allows the system to operate after the vehiole has been started (or lim¬ 
ited IHKA operation if the engine is not running). 


Grounds KL 31 

Ground paths are provided to the IHKA to oomplete the oirouits of the inputs, prooessing, 
and output oontrol funotions.

STARTING INPUT 


The starting (cranking KL50) input is monitored by the IHKAto “unload” consumers during 
engine cranking. This is a momentary signal that will cause the IHKA to deactivate heavy 
power oonsumers. 

This signal has a dedioated oirouit on E31/36 models, and is transmitted via BUS oommu- 
nioation on all other models.

DISTRIBUTION/ AIR DELIVERY SELECTION 


Distribution/air delivery selections are made at the control panel. On E31 models, the 
requested selection is monitored by the oontrol module whioh is remotely mounted. On all 
other models, the requested input seleotion is internally monitored beoause the oontrol 
panel and oontrol module are a oombined unit. 

The E31 oontrol panel is provided as an example. The IHKA oontrol module provides the 
power supply for the oontrol panel, then monitors the return voltage to determine the dis¬ 
tribution/air delivery seleotion. Notioe that the “AUTO” seleotion only illuminates the LED. 
The input is not monitored, therefore if no other seleotion is taken the system is in the auto 
program.

TEMPERATURE SELECTION 


Temperature selections are made via thumbwheels (early systems), and rocker switches 
(later systems). On E31 models, the requested temperature selection is monitored by the 
control module which is remotely mounted. On all other models, the requested input selec¬ 
tion for temperature is internally monitored because the control panel and control module 
are a combined unit. 

The E31 control panel is provided as an example. The IHKA control module provides the 
power and ground supply for the control panel potentiometers, then monitors the return 
voltage from the potentiometers to determine the temperature selection.

BLOWER CONTROL 


Blower control operation Is In operation with the Ignition switched on (KL15). The blower 
speed Is controlled by regulating (varying) the ground circuit through the use of transistors 
(final stage unit). 

The IHKA control module determines the appropriate blower speed using these primary 
Inputs: 

• Blower control thumbwheel/rocker switch Inputs 

• The “Y-factor” 

The On E31 models, the requested blower speed selection Is monitored by the control 
module which Is remotely mounted. On all other models, the requested Input selection for 
blower speed Is Internally monitored because the control panel and control module are a 
combined unit. 

The E31 control panel Is provided as an example. The IHKA control module provides the 
power and ground supply for the potentiometer, then monitors the return voltage to deter¬ 
mine the blower speed selection.

STRATIFIED AIR 


The request for air temperature stratification is made by a thumbwheel located in the front 
center face vent outlet and the rear passenger console outlet (if equipped). The thumbwheel 
potentiometer receives power and ground from the IHKA control module which also mon¬ 
itors the variable return voltage. In addition, the rear console outlet contains a micro-switch 
(on/off request) that signals to the IHKA control module to allow air flow to the rear console.

TEMPERATURE SENSOR MONITORING 


Several different temperature sensors provide inputs to the IHKA oontrol module. As previ¬ 
ously oovered, they are the NTC type. The IHKA oontrol module provides the power and 
ground paths. The module also monitors the oirouit voltage variation to determine temper¬ 
atures. This test applies to the following sensors: 


• Interior (internal oon- 
trol module oirouit for 
all models exoept E31) 

• Ambient (dedioated 
for E31/36, all other 
models supplied from 
Instrument oluster via 
K-bus) 

• Heater oore 

• Evaporator 

• Faoe vent (E38 only)

AUTOMATIC RECIRCULATED AIR (AUC if equipped) 


The IHKA control module uses data from the AUC sensor to determine whether reolroulat- 
Ing air mode Is neoessary. The AUC sensor samples ambient air that has entered the engine 
oompartment. The sensor oontalns a gas sensor, whioh measures the level of oxidizable 
gasses In the air. These Inolude hydrooarbons, NOx, SOx, and CO. 


The IHKA oontrol module monitors the ohange In the voltage signal as these gasses Influ- 
enoe the sensor. The seoond olroult shown Is a heating olroult whioh enhanoes the sensor’s 
reaotlon time. When starting the vehlole, fresh air Is always supplied for 90 seoonds due to 
the AUC sensor heat-up time.

COMPRESSOR SHUT OFF SIGNAL (if applicable) 


The IHKA module monitors the full load input from the ECM. If the ECM deteots “full load” 
oonditions, it signals (KOREL) the IHKA oontrol module to disengage the A/C oompressor. 
The oonditions for full load are: 

• Vehiole speed less than 10 mph, and 

• Throttle is wide open or 

• Engine ooolant temperature is too high 

The oompressor is turned off for a maximum of 4 minutes (aotual duration differs per sys¬ 
tem).

REFRIGERANT PRESSURE SENSOR (if applicable) 


The IHKA control module supplies the power and ground paths, as well as monitoring the 
variable voltage signal from the refrigerant pressure sensor (boated In the reoelver/dryer). 
Based on the refrigerant pressure, the IHKA module “antlolpates” the the start up torque of 
the A/C oompressor. If the pressure Is too low or high the oompressor will be deaotlvated. 

This Input Is also used to vary the auxiliary fan speed and transfers this Information on to 
the ECM via the K-bus.
