IHKA E46 CLIMATE CONTROL 


The IHKA heater/air 
conditioner in the E46 is 
very similar to E36. 
Design and component 
changes were made to 
improve the overall per¬ 
formance and opera¬ 
tion of the system. 

Features of the E46 
IHKA system include: 



• New Control Panel/Module • New fresh air micro filter 

• Single heater core for temperature regulation • Regulated A/C compressor 

• M-Bus Control of all stepper motors • Regulated auxiliary fan operation 



CONTROL PANEL 





If the “up arrow” button is pressed, air flows from the wind¬ 
shield defroster outlets. 

Pressing the “left arrow” button causes air to flow from the 
face vent outlets. 



When the “down arrow is pressed, air flows from the 
footwell outlets (front and rear). 

If the “AUTO” button is pressed, the control module auto¬ 
matically selects the appropriate flap positions for the 
sensed conditions (temperature dependent). When cooling 
is required, air flows from the face vents. When heating is 
required, air flows from the footwells and the windshield 
defroster outlets.

LCD Display: The E46 control panel/module 
has a backlit LCD display where the desired 
temperature and blower speed are shown. 
Display brightness varies according to ambi¬ 
ent light levels when the headlamps and park¬ 
ing lamps are “off”. With the lamps “on”, 
brightness depends on dimming rheostat 
thumbwheel position. 



Interior Temperature Sensor: As on all previous IHKA sys¬ 
tems, an interior temperature sensor is located inside the control 
panel/module. Also as on previous systems, the sensor has its 
own electric fan to ensure adequate air flow over the sensor. 




Temperature Selection Rocker Switch: The temperature 
selection rocker switch functions the same as those on E46 vehi¬ 
cles. 



Blower Rocker Switch: Blower speed is selected using a rock¬ 
er switch. Speed is increased by pressing the “+” end of the 
switch and decreased by pressing the end. 


When the system is at the lowest blower speed (speed “1”), 
pressing the end turn the system “Off”. 



Maximum Defrosting Button: This button function the same as 
the one on E38, except that the mixing flap is not affected (they 
are cable operated). When pressed: 


• the fresh air flaps are opened 

• the recirc. flaps are closed 

• the windshield defrost flaps are opened 

• all other distribution flaps are closed 

• the blower runs at maximum speed 

• the rear window defroster switches on 


The A/C compressor does not turn on automatically, but will run if the “snowflake”: button 
is pressed. 


3 
















A/C Compressor “snowflake” Button: Pressing the 
“snowflake” button causes the control panel/module to signal 
the engine control module (ECM) that A/C compressor opera¬ 
tion is desired. 


The ECM then energizes a relay to run the compressor. 



Recirculating Air Button: This button controls air intake 
location as on previously covered IHKA systems. 

On IHKA E46, though, recirculating air mode has no time 
limit. Once activated, it continues until the button is pressed 
again. However, the set position of recirc is saved for 15 
minutes after ignition has been switched off (except for hot 
country settings). In this case recirc must be reselected. 



Rear Window Defroster Button: Pressing the rear window 
defroster button activates the rear window heating for about 
17 minutes (depending on coding). Pressing the button again 
will activate the time cycle operation of 40 seconds on / 80 
seconds off for 5 minutes

IHKA E46 CONTROL PANEL/MODULE FUNCTIONS 


The control panel/module handles all the functions necessary to operate the IHKA system: 

• Blower speed • Heater core temperatures 

• Auxiliary cooling fan • Evaporator temperature 

• Air intake flaps (fresh/recirculating) • Special programmed functions 

• Air distribution flaps (face vent, footwell, defroster) • Rear window defrost timing 

And, like the E38 control panel/module, the E46 version has an EEPROM for fault code 
storage. The module can go into “sleep mode” to reduce power consumption when the 
ignition is switched “off,” but still retain control panel settings and fault code information. 
*NOTE: If the control module is replaced it must be coded. 

SUBSTITUTE VALUE OPERATION 


If an input potentiometer or sensor (or its circuit) fails, the control panel/module will ignore 
the faulty input and, in its place, use a replacement value which has been programmed into 
its memory for just this purpose. The replacement value, typically a mid-scale value for a

The substitute value for the evaporator temperature sensor is significantly below the A/C 
compressor cycling point (0°C). Therefore, if the evaporator temperature sensor signal is 
not plausible, the substitute value will switch the refrigeration system off.

FRESH AIR MICROFILTER 


The active carbon fresh air micro filter is installed in the fresh air inlet of the engine com¬ 
partment. The filter can be serviced quickly by removing the plastic cover and removing 
the filter.

IHKA E46 AIR INTAKE 



The fresh air flaps stepper motor operates only when the ignition switch is in “Run”. At 
engine shut-down, the fresh air flaps stay in their “last-used” position. When the ignition 
switch is again turned to “Run”, the control module/panel operates the stepper motor to 
move the flaps, if necessary. 


When open, the flaps are 
positioned according to road 
speed; the flaps close incre¬ 
mentally with change in the 
road speed (to prevent the 
flaps from continually open¬ 
ing and closing due to slight 
changes in speed). At 100 
mph the fresh air flaps are 
only 20% to 40% open 
(depending on blower 
speed).

The control panel/module processes the blower speed rocker switch input and sends a sig¬ 
nal to the final stage unit. The final stage unit then regulates blower motor voltage to con¬ 
trol blower speed, the “Y factor” can also influence blower speed in the “AUTO” program. 

The blower rocker is the master controller for the IHKA system as it 
can be used to switch the system “Off”. This is done by lowering 
blower speed to the lowest speed and then pressing the decrease 
(smaller fan) side of the button one more time: 

• The blower motor turns off and 

• All flaps are closed and 

• All function LEDs and the LCD display are switched off and 

• The rear window defroster is switched off and 

• The A/C compressor is switched off 

The interior temperature sensor blower continues to operate, though, and the control 
panel/module pulses the appropriate water valve if either left or right desired temperature is 
above the sensed interior temperature. 



The IHKA E46 system can be turned “on” again by pressing any button on the control 
panel/module face.

IHKA E46 BLOWER CONTROL 


IHKA E46 blower control is most similar to that of IHKA E36 since a separate final stage 
unit is mounted on the housing assembly (passenger’s side).

STEPPER MOTOR M-BUS CONTROL 

The E46 continues to use the M-Bus for stepper motor control. All five stepper motors of 
the IHKA are now bus controlled including: 

• Two fresh air/recirc-air flap motors 

• Face vent flap motor 

• Footwell flap motor 

• Defrost flap motor 

Due to the requirement for a fast acting motor for the fresh/recirc flaps, two different step¬ 
per motors (slow/fast) are used in the system.

TEMPERATURE REGULATION-HEATING 


The E46 uses one water valve/heater core as part of interior temperature regulation. The 
water valve is pulsed to control the flow of coolant through the heater core as on other sys¬ 
tems. 

Temperature regulation is based on the inputs from: 

• Temperature control switch 

• Interior temperature sensor 

• Ambient temperature signal (from instrument cluster via K-Bus) 

• Heater core sensor 

• Evaporator temperature signal 

• "Y" factor 


The rocker switch is used to select the desired interior temperature which is displayed in 
the matrix of the control panel. The range for temperature display is from 60 to 90 ° F.

IHKA E46 TEMPERATURE MIXING 


The temperature mixing flap is mechanically actuated, using the thumbwheel in the center 
face vent outlet 

Any time the face vents are open, rotating the thumbwheel will operate the mixing flap 
which is located above the space between the evaporator and the heater cores. Opening 
the mixing flap allows more cooled air to enter the face vent ductwork. Closing the flap 
increases the proportion of heated air which enters the face vent ductwork.

TEMPERATURE REGULATION COOLING 


Air conditioning control on the E46 is similar to the E39 IHKA system. The system uses the 
variable displacement compressor introduced on the E39. The swash plate of the com¬ 
pressor is hinged so that is can vary the piston travel based on the output requirements of 
the system.

COMPRESSOR CONTROL 


Control of the A/C compressor is a function of the MS42.0 engine control module which 
also regulates auxiliary fan operation. 

Pressing the snowflake button is a request for A/C activation. As long as the evaporator 
temperature is above 36°F, the IHKA will signal the MS42.0 control module to activate the 
compressor. 

The IHKA control module sends the following signals to the MS42.0 over the K-Bus and 
CAN Bus via the instrument cluster: 

• Request for A/C activation (signal KO) 

• Load torque for switching the compressor on 

• Requested auxiliary fan speed 

The IHKA determines the load torque for compressor activation and required auxiliary fan 
speed from the pressure sensor mounted on the receiver/dryer. 

The refrigerant pressure sensor provides a linear voltage input signal (0-5 volts) to the IHKA 
control module. The IHKA processes this signal and determines the load torque of the sys¬ 
tem (0 to 30 Nm with a variable displacement compressor). The higher the pressure in the 
system, the higher the voltage input signal to the IHKA. The pressure sensor inputs to IHKA 
too high or too low will cause the compressor to be deactivated. 

The output signal to the MS42.0 will enable the engine control module to modify the idle 
speed, timing and fuel injection amount based on the load that will be imposed when the 
compressor is activated. 

For full engine load situations, the compressor activation is “cut out”. The cut out time is 
for 4-10 seconds when the full throttle signal is present and vehicle speed is less than 10 
mph. 


15 


AUXILIARY FAN CONTROL 


The Auxiliary Fan motor incorporates an 
output final stage that activates the fan 
motor at variable speeds. 

The auxiliary fan is controlled by ECM. The 
motor output stage receives power and 
ground and activates the motor based on a 
PWM signal (10-100 Hz) received from the 
ME 7.2. 


The fan is activated based on the following 
factors: 



FAN MOTOR MODULE 


POWER, GROUND & SIGNAL WIRES 


Radiator outlet temperature sensor input exceeds a preset temperature. 

IHKA signalling via the K and CAN bus based on calculated refrigerant pressures. 
Vehicle speed 
Battery voltage level 


When the over temperature light in the instrument cluster is on (120°C) the fan is run in the 
overrun function. This signal is provided to the ECM via the CAN bus. When this occurs 
the fan is run at a frequency of 10 Hz.

The pressure sensor receives a 5 volt power supply from the IHKA control unit. The sen¬ 
sor signal is evaluated and forwarded to the DME via the K-Bus. In the process, the refrig¬ 
erant pressure in the air-conditioning circuit is converted to a load torque and calculation 
for the required fan speed (stage)

SYSTEM OPERATION 


The balance of the E46 IHKA system’s features and operation carry over from the E36 
including: 


• Stepper motor calibration run 

• Cold start interlock 

DIAGNOSIS TROUBLESHOOTING 

The “self diagnostics” of the IHKA control module monitors the status of inputs and outputs 
of the system. If a fault is detected, it is initially entered in RAM and then in the EEPROM 
when the ignition is switched off. If available, a replacement value will be activated when 
various sensor faults are detected as with previous systems. A maximum of six faults can 
be stored in the EEPROM when the ignition is switched off. 

The E46 IHKA is connected to the diagnostic link via the K-Bus/instrument cluster. The 
system uses the E46 “Fault Symptom Troubleshooting” procedures for troubleshooting 
problems and faults with the system. 

When troubleshooting problems with the E46 IHKA, it is important to note that because the 
Car/Key Memory feature can change the functionality of the system, a review of the setting 
should be performed prior to condemning a component as faulty. 


18 


IHKA PERSONALIZATION 


The features of Car/Key Memory allow various functions/features of the IHKA control to be 
tailored to the individual owner's/driver's wishes. 

The functions of the IHKA that can be programmed to the owner's/driver's wishes include: 

• Automatic activation of recirc when the vehicle is started 

• Adjustment (raising/lowering) of the blower speed 

• Automatic opening of the ventilation flaps with warm coolant 

• Automatic closing of the footwell flap with A/C activation 

• Automatic closing of the defroster flaps with A/C activation 

• Correction of the set temperature (raise/lower) 

• Automatic activation of the compressor control when the ignition is switched on 

• Auto program for the blower control when the ignition is switched on 

These features are programmed using the coding/programming function of the DIS/MoDiC.
