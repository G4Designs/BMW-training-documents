INTRODUCTION 


Several general system operation concepts apply to both the IHKR and IHKA Climate 
Control Systems. These concepts should be familiar to you before you begin to learn about 
the specifics of the IHKR and IHKA systems. 

The general system operation concepts are: 

• Inputs, Processing, Outputs (IPO) 

• Temperature Sensor Monitoring 

• The “Y- Factor” 

• Stepper Motor Operation 


INPUTS, PROCESSING, OUTPUTS 


All modern, microprocessor-controlled 
systems use various sensors, switches, 
voltage signal circuits, ground signal 
circuits, etc. to provide information to a 
system control module. These sensors, 
switches, and other components are 
known as the input devices; the 
information or signals they provide are 
known simply as the inputs. Typically, 
each input has its own, dedicated 
terminal or pin at the control module. 



Some examples of inputs to the climate control system control module are: 

• heater core temperatures (from the heater core temperature sensors) 

• evaporator temperature (from the evaporator temperature sensor) 

• refrigerant pressure (from the compound pressure switch on the receiver/dryer) 

• stratified air thumbwheel position (from the thumbwheel potentiometer) 

• vehicle speed (from the vehicle speed sensor) 

• A/C compressor request (from the A/C compressor “snowflake” button) 

• the start signal, Kl. 50 (from the ignition switch). 

The system control module repetitively accepts all the inputs (many times each second) 
and processes them.

Engineers and researchers thought about how the module should respond 
inputs, combinations of inputs, or even missing inputs, and then programmed 
module microprocessor to perform in each case.

to specific 
the control 


Each time the control module processes the inputs, it provides power or ground circuits 
to operate solenoids, stepper motors, relays, lamps, etc., or it may send signals to other 
control modules. The signals or power/ground circuits provided by the control module are 
known as its outputs. The actual component operated (relay, solenoid, motor, etc.) is 
referred to as the output device. 


As an example, the IHKA climate module operates both the blower motor and the water 
valves. 


• The input used to request blower speed is the blower speed knob, which goes to 
the processing area for blower speed control. If the input device is faulty, or the 
circuit is broken, the blower control processing area does not receive all the 
information necessary, and will operate the blower speed based on a substitute 
value. 

• The water valve control processing, however, which does not use the blower 
speed knob input, will continue to function normally. 

To perform diagnosis efficiently, it’s important to understand which inputs are 
used to control a specific output. Or perhaps more importantly, which inputs will 
not affect a specific output. 

BMW uses Inputs, Processing, Outputs diagrams (IPOs) to provide a quick view of the 
important features of microprocessor controlled systems. Typically (as shown in the 
previous graphics), inputs are shown on the left side of the IPO, the processor (control 
module) is shown in the middle, and the outputs are shown on the right.

TEMPERATURE SENSOR MONITORING 


Several different temperature sensors provide inputs to the climate control module. These 
Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) are resistors which are sensitive to changes in 
temperature. 


The NTC sensors used on the IHKR and IHKA Climate Control Systems have the property 
that their resistance decreases with increasing temperature.

The resistance “curve” (a plot of temperature vs. resistance) for the heater core temperature 
sensor is shown below. 


Heater Core Temperature Sensor 



5 






































































































































































The control module applies a reference voltage (approx. 5 
volts DC) to each sensor circuit, as shown here, and monitors 
the voltage present on the sensor signal circuit. In the 
example shown, the sensor signal voltage is monitored by the 
control module at point “A” in the circuit. 

The resistor shown inside the control module has a “fixed” 
resistance (its resistance does NOT change with temperature). 
It is added to the temperature sensor circuit in order to drop 
the supply voltage from battery down to a 5 volt reference that 
will be influenced by sensor resistance. 

The heater core example shown above can be redrawn as 
a simple schematic, placing a volt meter at the point where 
the control module would be measuring sensor voltage. 

The control module is programmed to voltage values that 
are reasonable for each signal circuit. If the module 
receives a voltage signal that is much too high or much too 
low for a particular sensor, it assumes that the sensor is 
defective and disregards the signal.

The module will then store a fault code in memory and begin using a “substitute” value in 
place of the actual sensor signal. This allows the climate control system to function until 
the faulty component can be replaced. 


THE “Y-FACTOR” 


Y-Factor is the term used to describe how much heating 
effort or cooling effort (expressed as a percentage) is 
required by the microprocessor-controlled climate control 
system (IHKR/IHKA) for it to achieve the desired passenger 
compartment temperature. The terms “adjusting factor,” 
“master controller,” and “guide control” are sometimes used 
in place of Y-Factor. 

The climate control system control module computes the Y- 
Factor (actually two Y-Factors, one for the driver’s side of the 
vehicle, Y L , and one for the passenger’s side, Y R ), using the 

information it receives from some of the inputs.

The Y-Factors (left & right) computed from 
these inputs have numerical values ranging 
from -27.5% to +100% and can be displayed 
on the DIS for diagnostic purposes. (Except 
E46) 

Values between -27.5% and 20% indicate that 
the system is working to cool the interior; 
values from about 20% to 100% indicate that 
it is warming the interior.

Y-FACTOR 

The desired temperatures (left and right) and interior temperature are the primary inputs 
used to compute the Y-factor. (The control module monitors the temperatures that the 
passengers want, monitors the existing interior temperature, and controls outputs to make 
the two match.) The left desired temperature input has priority over the right, when the left 
input is set to the minimum or maximum values. 

For a given Y-Factor, the control module can perform the following actions to achieve the 
desired interior temperatures: 

• pulse a coolant flow control valve to regulate left heater core temperature 

• pulse a coolant flow control valve to regulate right heater core temperature 

• operate a relay to turn an electric coolant pump on and off (except E36 & E46) 

• operate stepper motors to recirculate interior air, instead of using outside air 

• operate stepper motors to control air discharge location (IHKA only) 

• boost blower speed to decrease interior cool down or warm up time (IHKA only) 


7 































































































































Some sample temperature readings with approximate Y-factor values appear below and on 
the following page. 

With the large difference between the desired and interior temperatures, Y-Factors of 100% 
should be expected since the system will work as hard as possible to increase interior 
temperature. 

As the interior warms up, the Y-Factors drop steadily to avoid grossly “overshooting” the 
desired temperatures. Coolant valves, initially held “wide open,” are pulsed more frequently 
to reduce coolant flow (and heater core temperatures). Due to the extremely low ambient 
temperature, the control module will “boost” (or in the case shown above, “create”) a 
difference between interior and desired temperatures to offset rapid heat loss to the 
atmosphere. 


Despite the “match” 
between interior and 
desired temperatures, the 
Y-Factors will still be 100% 
due to the low heater core 
temperature. The control 
module initially keeps the 
coolant valves wide open 
to utilize all heat available 
from the engine. As soon 
as the heater cores begin 
to warm up, though, the Y- 
Factors will drop rapidly 
since sufficient heat can 
be obtained with very low 
flow through the cores. 


With the engine warmed- 
up, the climate control 
system expends very little 
effort to maintain interior 
temperature. The coolant 
valves are seldom opened, 
maintaining heater core 
temperatures just above 
the desired temperatures.

The heater cores are now nearly at evaporator temperature since they are placed directly 
in the flow of cold air and the coolant valves are kept closed. Once interior temperature 
drops a few more degrees, recirc. mode will be discontinued and the system will draw in 
only fresh air. 


STEPPER MOTOR OPERATION 

BMW IHKR and IHKA Climate Control Systems use 12 volt DC electric stepper motors to 
operate many of the air inlet, air distribution and temperature mixing flaps. While different 
types of stepper motors are used on different vehicles, they all share many desirable 
characteristics: 

• lower power consumption 

• operate in both directions 

• can be started and stopped in any position 

• provide quick movement 

• move in precise increments 

• does not require feedback potentiometers to determine position 

• remain in position when shut off 

• have long service life 

Unlike a “normal” 12 volt DC motor (for example, a blower motor) in which the rotor spins 
through many revolutions per second when the motor receives power a stepper motor rotor 
rotates through only a small angle when it receives power and then it stops.

“CONVENTIONAL” STEPPER MOTOR 


An extremely simple stepper motor circuit 
is shown to the right; it consists of a bar 
shaped permanent magnet which can 
rotate about its center, a “C” shaped piece 
of soft iron, a length of insulated copper 
wire (wrapped around the piece of soft 
iron), a switch, and a battery. 

With the switch open, the bar magnet will 
rotate to position itself with the soft iron as 
shown and it will stay there.

When the switch is closed, current flows 
through the wire creating a magnetic field. 
With the wire wrapped around the soft 
iron in the direction shown here, the 
magnetic field North pole will be located 
at the top. 

Since “like” poles repel and opposites 
attract, the permanent magnet rotor will 
turn 180 degrees to align itself with the 
new magnetic field and then it will stop 
there.

NOTE: In this simple motor, the rotor can 
turn in either direction to reach its new 
position. 


Opening the switch will cause the 
magnetic field to collapse, but the rotor 
will remain in its new position. 

By reversing battery polarity, though, and 
closing the switch, a new magnetic field is 
created. One that has its North pole 
located at the bottom of the “C.” The 
rotor moves again, this time back to its 
original position. 



10 



















































































Using this information, we can again 
redraw the parts of the circuit in a slightly 
different way to get a stepper motor that 
is closer to the ones found on BMW 
vehicles. 

All we’ve done is wrap two coils around 
the soft iron core (one wound in each 
direction to give opposite polarities), and 
use two switches so each coil can be 
energized independently. 

Rearranging some parts of this circuit 
just one more time puts the beginning of 
both coils at the middle of the “C” (for 
manufacturing reasons) so we have to 
wind the top coil in the other direction to 
have its polarity stay the same. 

The bottom coil is unchanged. 




Now, momentarily closing switch “B” 
energizes the bottom coil, a magnetic 
field forms with its North pole at the top, 
and the rotor turns 180 degrees to align 
with the field. 

The rotor then stops there. 



Momentarily closing switch “A” 
energizes the top coil, a magnetic field 
forms with its North pole at the bottom, 
and the rotor turns 180 degrees again to 
align with the new field. 

Alternately closing switches “A” and “B” 
toggles the magnetic field polarity, 
causing the rotor to rotate in 180 degree 
steps

Compare our “generic” 90 ° stepper motor to a BMW climate control system stepper motor 
as shown in an Electrical Troubleshooting Manual (ETM) and note the similarities.

module for the ETM version) 


Another important difference 
for the actual BMW part is 
that it is mounted on a high 
reduction gearbox. In fact, 
on the typical stepper motor, 
the stepper motor rotor must 
rotate about 300 revolutions 
(that’s 7200 separate rotor 
steps) for the gearbox output 
shaft to rotate through just a 
single revolution. 



This high-reduction gear box allows a relatively low power motor to operate the flaps 
against the substantial suction and pressure forces generated by the blower motor. 


12 







































Taking another look at an “actual” BMW stepper motor, notice that it requires 5 
connections: 

• power (to all 4 coils) 

• ground (control) to coil “SI ” 

• ground (control) to coil “S2” 

• ground (control) to coil “S3” 

• ground (control) to coil “S4” 


These connections are important for diagnostic 
purposes, since it is impractical to run a stepper 
motor once it has been disconnected from the 
control module. 

One way to test for a faulty stepper motor is to 
measure coil resistance. 



On E31, E32, and E34 stepper motors except All Except Fresh Air Flap Motor 

the fresh air flap motor, each of the motor’s 4 

field coils has a resistance of about 85 ohms. 


For the fresh air flap motor only on E31, E32, 
and E34 vehicles, each of the 4 field coils has a 
resistance of about 26 ohms. 

The fresh air flap motor is designed to operate 
faster in the “close flap” direction than in the 
“open flap” direction, so it has different 
characteristics. It’s easy to distinguish the fresh 
air flap stepper motor from the other motors 
because it has a different color identification 
label; typically red or blue, depending on 
production date. 



Fresh Air Flap Motor Only 


“SMART” STEPPER MOTORS 


Until the E38 was introduced, the stepper motors used in IHKR and IHKA climate control 
systems did not contain electronic components, and only 3 part numbers were needed to 
service all the motor assemblies. As described earlier in this Handout, the motors 
consisted of copper wire coils wrapped around iron cores (pole pieces), and permanent 
magnet rotors, all attached to a high-reduction mechanical gearbox. The system electronic 
control components were located inside the climate control module assembly. 


13 





































































































Starting with the E38 climate control system, some of the control module electronics were 
moved into the stepper motors, making the E38 motors (except the fresh air flaps motor) 
substantially different from the “conventional” stepper motors we’ve already discussed. 


The circuits feeding these new “smart” stepper motors also changed — for one thing, there 
are only three circuits: 


power 

ground 

signal 


Also, all 9 smart stepper motors used on the E38 system share the same set of power, 
ground, and signal circuits. (Left and right branches are connected inside the control 
module.) The fresh air flaps “conventional” stepper motor has its own separate circuits. 



These stepper motors have the same type gear box, permanent magnet rotor, and 4 field 
coils as a “conventional” stepper motor. Plus, it still receives operating signals from the 
system control module. 


An E38/E39/E46 stepper motor constantly receives power and ground on two of the 
terminals, and operating instructions on the third. 


"SMART" STEPPER MOTOR 



14 











































































































































The operating instructions are digital signals which “tell” the stepper motor whether to open 
or close a flap. The microprocessor inside the stepper motor receives the instructions and 
converts them into pulses to operate the permanent magnet rotor. 

Notice that this 3-wire arrangement (referred to as the M-Bus) allows the control module to 
operate the motor using only 1 signal circuit instead of the 4 control circuits used previously. 

And, since all 9 smart stepper motors are connected to the same signal circuit, a total of 
35 separate circuits between the control module and the motors can be eliminated. 

But how can the system operate with just one signal circuit for all 9 motors? 

• Each of the 9 stepper motors is different (and has its own part number). 

• The control module identifies which motor it want to operate before it issues the 
commands. 


The part number is clearly marked on 
every stepper motor, and every stepper 
motor must be installed in the correct 
location on the climate control housing. 

The operating instructions issued to the smart stepper motors by the control module are 
much more sophisticated than with conventional stepper motors. The sequence of events 
appears below: 

• The control module determines that a flap position must change 

• It issues a “wake-up call” to alert the stepper motors that a command is coming 

• It “names” the motor that is to respond to the command 

• It issues the command signal, e.g. “move 15 steps clockwise” 

• All the stepper motors “hear” the command 

• Only the stepper motor that “hears its name” follows the command 

• The “named” stepper motor then informs the control module that it has carried 
out the command

Air distribution of the IHKA E38 (for example) is regulated using stepper motors. There are 
10 stepper motors used for air distribution including:

DEFROST FLAP 
FOOTWELL FLAP

REAR VIEW 



PASSENGER'S SIDE 



TOP VIEW 

Of these 10 stepper motors, the Fresh Air Flap stepper motor is operated as on previous 
systems. It has four circuits that control the motor rotation with a 500 Hz signal at each 
circuit as needed. 


The remaining 9 stepper motors each contain a microprocessor that monitors operating 
signals on the M-Bus. When a specific signal is “heard” on the M-Bus the motor is 
activated by the microprocessor to carry out its function. Therefore, correct location by part 
number is critical. 


16 










































































































































CALIBRATION RUN 


If the battery is disconnected, IHKA control module memory is cleared and the module 
loses its information about where the flaps are positioned. Therefore, when power is 
restored, the control module performs a calibration run, whether the IHKA system is turned 
“On” or “Off”. 

The control module runs all the stepper motors at maximum speed to fully close the flaps, 
and then continues to run the motors for a few seconds more than the normal endstop-to- 
endstop time, in order to ensure the flaps are closed. 

The calibration run takes about 40 seconds. During that time, soft “ticking” or “scratching” 
noises can be heard, as the flaps reach their endstops but continue to be pulsed. 

The control module also monitors system voltage. A sudden surge or dropout causes the 
control module to automatically perform the calibration run.
