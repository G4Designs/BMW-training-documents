INTRODUCTION 


The heating/air conditioning systems of the E36/5 and /7 (318ti and Z3) were specifically 
designed for use in these models. The system is a so-called “controlled” system. The 

temperature and air distribution are controiied, NOT reguiated. 

The systems are called “INKS”. Translated from German, the acronym means, “Integrated 
Heating and Air Conditioning Controi.” 

Highlights of the IHKS system include: 

• Compact heater case design with microfilter for air iniet (318ti only). 

• Temperature control through air blending fiap. 

• Mechanicai air distribution control. 

• One fresh/recirc air flap stepper motor. 

• Four-speed resistor controlled blower motor.

AIR DISTRIBUTION CONTROL 


The air distribution is totally dependent on the position of the rotary knob. It Is similar in 
operation to the E36 IHKR system. The defrost, face vent and footwell flaps are all 
controlled with a bowden cable and gear linkage mechanism. The knob rotates 360° to give 
the following air distribution:

REAR WINDOW DEFROSTER 

The rear window defroster is switched on through a relay when the control button button is 
pressed. It remains on until switched Off by the button or the ignition is switched Off. There 
is no timed operation for the rear window defroster.

COMPONENTS 


HOUSING 


The lightweight design of the INKS housing provides a strong, compact, integral structure 
for the INKS components. The Z3 and 318ti system housings are Identical In function but 
have differences in the following areas. 


• The Z3 has a dual squirrel cage blower wheel versus the single blower wheel of the 318tl. 

• The Z3 housing has a slightly shorter profile. 

• The Z3’s INKS control module Is mounted on the driver’s side of the housing versus the 
passenger’s side of the 318ti. 

• The Z3 does not utilize an air inlet microfilter like the 318tl. 

• The mounted angle of the heater core In the Z3 system is “flatter” In the housing 
compared with the 318ti.

TEMPERATURE REGULATION - HEATING 


Discharge air temperature in the heating mode is controlled by the air blending flap. The 
rotary temperature knob controls the air blending flap, which determines how much air 
passes through the heater core. 

Turning the knob clockwise will gradually Increase the temperature of the air discharged into 
the cabin.

WATER VALVE 


Water flow through the heater core is 
controlled by a water valve. The water valve 
is either open or closed. There is no pulsed 
regulation of the valve. The water valve is 
open except when the tennperature knob is 
in the full cold position. This is controlled by 
a microswitch mounted on the heater 
control panel. 

The microswitch provides either switched: 

• Ground in the 318ti or 

• Power in the Z3 

HEATER CORE 

The single heater core unit has one coolant 
supply tube and one return tube. The 
heater core can be removed without 
removing the housing from the vehicle. 

Remove the retaining screws as shown in 
the illustration. Drain the coolant from the 
system and disconnect the hoses from the 
supply and return tubes. Slide the heater 
core from the housing.

TEMPERATURE REGULATION - AIR CONDITIONING 


Discharge air temperature in the A/C mode is also controlled by the air blending flap. The 
rotary knob controls how much air passes through the heater core. 

Compressor control Is a function of the IHKS control module and the Engine Control 
Module (ECM). When the “snowflake” button is pressed, the ECM is signaled for idle 
stabilization; it then switches the compressor On by activating the control side of the 
compressor relay. 


The ECM will switch the compressor Off when the IHKS control module senses that 
evaporator temperature has dropped to approximately 3°C (or under full load as with the 
previous ECM systems). 

EVAPORATOR 












































































































EVAPORATOR TEMPERATURE SENSOR 


The evaporator temperature sensor is a long, 
thin probe which is inserted into the left side 
of the INKS housing. The sensor is a 
Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) 
thermistor, whose resistance varies 
according to temperature. 

The evaporator temperature sensor tip 
reaches several inches into the evaporator 
core, where an accurate measurement of the 
core’s temperature can be obtained. 



INKS CONTROL MODULE 


The INKS control module is mounted on the 
system housing: 

• Z3 on driver’s side 

• 318ti on the passenger’s side 

The INKS control module’s scope of function 
is to monitor the evaporator temperature 
sensor signal and notify the ECM to switch 
off the compressor if the evaporator is close 
to freezing temperature (3°C). 

EXPANSION VALVE 



The expansion valve of the INKS system Is 
accessible from inside the vehicle in the 
passenger’s footwell area. 

To access the expansion valve, a housing 
cover must first be removed. The expansion 
valve Is Installed in the INKS housing. Sound 
deadening putty is packed around the 
expansion valve to minimize noise. Remove 
the putty to access the mounting bolts. 

When reinstalling the valve, make sure a 
sufficient quantity of putty is packed around 
the expansion valve to prevent a future noise 
complaint.

FAN SPEED CONTROL 


318ti 


Fan speed is controlled using a four-position 
switch and a resistor pack to vary blower 
motor voltage. The resistor pack is mounted 
on the heater case in the air stream for 
cooiing purposes. 

The resistor pack is accessibie from the 
engine compartment with the microfilter 
removed. To access the microfilters, 
remove the air inlet grille at the center of the 
cowl. Unscrew the air inlet bulkhead panel 
and plastic cover. Pull the bulkhead panel 
from engine compartment and remove the 
exposed microfilters.

TO FRESH AIR/ 
RECIRCULATING 
FLAP MOTOR 



The fan switch is the master controller for the system. In the 0 position, the A/C compressor 
is switched off, the recirc flaps are opened, and the fresh air flaps are closed. 

In fan speeds 1, 2 and 3, the blower motor’s speed is cut back with the resistor pack. In 
speed 4, the blower motor receives full battery voltage. 

The recirc LED over the button will remain On when the fan switch is Off to indicate the 
recirc mode. There is no possibility of fresh air in the cabin with the fan switch Off. 

The fresh air/recirc flaps are controlled with one motor. The fresh air flaps are open until the 
recirc button is pressed or the fan switch is switched Off. 


11 























































The resistor pack in the Z3 INKS is located on the blower motor. It’s accessible from the 
engine compartment. Remove the blower motor cover. Unclip the resistor pack from the 
blower motor and pull outward. 



On the Z3, the fan switch controls only the fan speed. It has no influence on the 
recirculating air function as it does on the 318ti. The fresh air flaps remain open when the 
switch is in the 0 position, if the recirculating air or “snowflake” button Is pressed with the 
fan switch in the 0 position, the fan will automatically run at very slow speed.

IHKS DIAGNOSIS 


The IHKS system is not connected to the diagnostic 
link. Conventionai troubieshooting methods are 
used for diagnosis/troubleshooting probiems with 
this system. 


The best diagnostic tool you can have is a thorough 
understanding of the system’s individual components 
and the way they work. You should know which 
inputs affect which outputs, and how the ECM and 
IHKS module will respond if an input is outside 
allowable values. 

Also, know how to use the resources available to 
you: 

• Electrical Troubleshooting Manuals (ETMs). 

• Service-Information Bulletins. 


• Diagnosis and Information System (DIS). Refer 
to the DIS for repair manual procedures, 
technical data, etc. 

• If insufficient cooling is the complaint, make sure the water valve is actually closing. 

Technician Tip: have an assistant turn the temperature knob from the Fuii Hot to the Fuii 
Coid position and back severai times. Use a stethoscope to iisten to the water valve, to 
make sure it is actuaiiy ciosing, and check temperature of heater hoses. 

• Check high-side and low-side pressures when the compressor is operating. 

• When leak checking, look for wet spots on the hoses or at fitting connections.

INKS CONTROL 
SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS 


start all diagnosis of the INKS control system with the “INKS Function Check.” The function 
check leads to a specific chart or test. Finish all diagnosis by repeating the “IHKS Function 
Check ” to ensure correct diagnosis. 

Some diagnostic procedures require the ignition switch to remain On for extended periods 
of time. Low battery voltage may result, causing incorrect voltage readings. If vehicle 
system voltage becomes low, connect a battery charger to the electrical system and apply 
a slow charge while testing. 

Most intermittent failure, check suspect circuits for: 

• Poor mating of connector halves or • Improperly formed or damaged 

terminals backed out. terminals. 

• Dirt or corrosion on the terminals. • Poor termlnals-to-wire connection

IHKS FUNCTION CHECK 


The following procedures check the IHKS control system. All the steps can be performed 
without using tools. Detailed diagnostic procedures follow the system check and are 
referenced in each step. 

Complete this check with the temperature outside the vehicle at 60° F or higher, and with 
the engine running.
