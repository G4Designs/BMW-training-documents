WATER VALVES 


Temperature regulation on IHKA systems is aoeomplished by solenoid aotuated water 
valve(s). The valve(s) are normally held open by spring pressure (failsafe), and are eleotrioal- 
ly olosed by pulses from the IHKA oontrol module to regulate the flow of hot ooolant to the 
heater eore(s). 


The water valve(s) are pulsed aooording to the Y-faotor, whioh is oaloulated from the fol¬ 
lowing inputs: 


• Desired temperature request (left and right if equipped) 

• Interior temperature 

• Heater oore temperature(s) 

• Ambient air temperature 

• Blower speed request 


When the desired tem¬ 
perature sails for maxi¬ 
mum heat, the water 
valve(s) do not reoeive 
pulses and are meohan- 
ioally sprung open. 

Similarly, when maxi¬ 
mum oooling is request¬ 
ed, the IHKA oontrol 
module powers the 
water valve(s) oomplete- 
ly olosed.

AUXILIARY COOLANT PUMP 


All models except E36/46 use an electrically powered auxiliary coolant pump to ensure that 
an adequate supply of hot coolant Is always available to the heater core(s). The IHKA con¬ 
trol module operates the pump directly (E31 uses a relay) by supplying the ground circuit. 

Pump “ON” operating criteria (E38 shown as an example): 


• Engine coolant temperature > 32°F (supplied via K-Bus on E38/39/46) 

• Y-factor > 5% 

• Maximum defrost mode selected 

• Maximum heating requested 

• “REST” function requested 



Pump “OFF” when: t 


• Engine coolant tern- i 
perature < 32°F and 
either Y-Factor < 
0%, unless other 
Inputs call for pump 
operation

BLOWER SPEED SIGNAL 


The blower speed is controlled by the IHKA control module regulating (varying) the ground 
circuit through the use of transistors (final stage unit). 

The IHKA control module determines the appropriate blower speed using these primary 
inputs: 

• Blower control thumbwheel/rocker switch inputs 

• The “Y-factor” 

In the case of the E38 (shown), each of the blower speed requests are monitored by the 
IHKA control module. The control module always runs the blower at the higher selected 
speed to ensure adequate air flow through the interior. The outlet flap opening will be 
reduced on the side requesting less blower speed. 


NOTE: Some models do not use a blower relay.

STEPPER MOTOR CONTROL 


stepper motors are installed in the system to provide infinitely variable operation of the air 
outlet flaps for automatio olimate oontrol. M-Bus (3 wire flat harness) oontrolled motors are 
used to operate all flaps, with the exoeption on some models of a dedioated fresh air motor 
and oirouit. 

Eaoh of these motors features its own eleotronio oirouitry and is eleotrioally ooded, indioat- 
ing that installation is unique to a speoifio flap. 

These type of stepper motors reoeive power and ground on two of the terminals, and 
ooded operating instruotions on the third. The instruotions are digital signals (500 Hz) that 
oontrol opening or olosing of the flaps. The mioroprooessor inside the stepper motor 
reoeives the instruotions and oonverts them into pulses to operate the permanent magnet

COMPRESSOR CONTROL 


Using the E38 (99 MY) for this test, activation of the compressor clutch is an output con¬ 
trol function of the IHKA module. Activation is carried out directly through a final stage (no 
relay required). 

If the evaporator temperature is above 37°F (3°C), and the refrigerant pressure sensor indi¬ 
cates acceptable pressure, the control panel/module then signals the ECM that it is about 
to activate the compressor. The IHKA module will then activate the compressor if a can¬ 
cellation signal is not received from the ECM. 

Additional criteria: 

• If the “snowflake” button is on at engine start-up, the control module delays compres¬ 
sor clutch activation until the engine speed exceeds 600 RPM for at least 5 seconds. 

• If the “snowflake” is switched off while the engine is running, the control module contin¬ 
ues to cycle the compressor (with increasingly longer off times) for up to 15 minutes. 

Compressor deactivation: 

• ECM detects full load - signalling IHKA 

• Evaporator temperature < 2°C 

• Coolant temperature > 120°C 

• Refrigerant pressure sensor indicates pressure is too low/high

AUXILIARY FAN CONTROL 


Using a 99 MY vehicle (E38/39/46) for this test, the variable auxiliary fan is controlled by the 
ECM. The auxiliary fan request comes from the IHKA control module via the K-Bus. The fan 
speed request is based on the refrigerant pressure sensor input to the IHKA. Additional fac¬ 
tors monitored by the ECM that influence fan operation are: 

• Radiator outlet temperature sensor (exceeds the preset temperature) 

• Vehicle speed 

• Battery voltage level 

The auxiliary fan motor incorporates an output final stage that activates the fan motor at 
variable speeds. The output stage receives an output signal (pulse width modulated 10-100 
Hz) from the ECM which activates the motor.

REAR WINDOW DEFROSTER 


Using the E38 as an example for this test, the rear window defroster operating strategy 
depends upon ambient temperature. 

• If ambient temperature is < 5°F (-15°C), pressing the rear window defroster but 

ton (ignition switoh in “Run”), requests the oontrol module to aotivate the defroster for 17 
minutes, and then switoh it off. 

• If the ambient temperature is > 5°F (-15°C), the oontrol module aoitvates the defroster 
for only 10 minutes before switohing it off. 


• Reaotivating the defroster by pressing the button again will give an additional 5 minutes 
of defrosting, regardless of ambient temperature. 


• If the ignition is 
switohed “OFF” during 
defroster operation, the 
timer keeps operating 
and the defroster is 
deaotivated. If the igni¬ 
tion is switohed “ON” 
again with time remain¬ 
ing, the defroster is 
automatioally reaotivat- 
ed until the timer runs 
out. 

• If the battery voltage 
drops bellow 11.4 
volts, the defroster 
automatioally switohed 
“OFF”, and will resume 
operation when the 
voltage rises above 
12.2 volts.

WINDSHIELD BASE/ WASHER SPRAY JET HEATERS 


Using the E38 as an example for this test, this circuit demonstrates that both heater sys¬ 
tems are powered by the same relay. 

• The lower portion of the windshield contains heating elements which when powered, 
prevent the wiper blades from freezing to the glass. 

• The washer spray jet heaters are designed to prevent ice from forming on and obstruct¬ 
ing the washer nozzles. 

The control module monitors the signal from the ambient temperature sensor (K-Bus) and 
automatically activates the relay in this circuit when 

r'"“ 

• Ambient temperature is < 38°F (3°C), and iS 

• The ignition is “ON” and 

• Battery voltage is > 12.2 volts 


If the ambient temperature exceeds 43°F 
(6°C), the windshield base/washer spray jet 
heaters are switched off.

PARKED CAR VENTILATION 


Parked car ventilation (if equipped), operates at pre-programmed times, the IHKA control 
module: 

• Opens the fresh air flaps, faoe vent flaps, and 

• Closes all other flaps, and 

• Operates the blower motor at low speed for one-half hour 
Using the E38 as an example: 

• All switohing is oontrolled direotly by the IHKA oontrol panel 

• Desired ventilation “ON” times are programmed into the IKE On-Board Computer (BO) 
using the Multi-Information Display (MID) 

• The BO in the IKE then oommunioates with the IHKA module over the l-Bus and the K- 
Bus

IHKA/ECM INTERFACES 


The IHKA signals the ECM when A/C is requested (KO signal), this alerts the ECM to sta¬ 
bilize idle speed (EML on 750iL) and oompensate for the additional load. This signal is Pulse 
Width Modulated (5 Hz), whioh informs the ECM of the “get ready” request and the antioi- 
pated oompressor load. On the 99 MY (E38/39/46), the A/C on signal is transmitted via the 
K-Bus/CAN-Bus. 

On E38/39 models, the ECM sends a reply (KOREL) signal to the IHKA oontrol module. If 
input oonditions are oorreot, the IHKA will aotivate the A/C oompressor. In addition this sep¬ 
arate signal oirouit is used to signal the IHKA to deaotivate the oompressor in the event that 
stand still full load oonditions are present. 

On E46/36 models, the A/C oompressor relay is aotivated by the ECM.
