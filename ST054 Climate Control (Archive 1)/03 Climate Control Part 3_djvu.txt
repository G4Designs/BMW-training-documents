A serious environmental probiem has been oreated by disoharging R-12 refrigerant into 
the atmosphere. CFC’s cause very iong-term damage to the stratospheric ozone iayer.

One CFG Molecule Destroys Many Ozone Molecules 

One molecule of R-12 can destroy many molecules of ozone. In the upper atmosphere, 
ultraviolet light breaks off a chlorine atom from an R-12 molecule. 

The chlorine attacks an ozone molecule, breaking it apart. An ordinary oxygen moiecuie 
and a molecule of chlorine monoxide are formed. 

A free oxygen atom breaks up the chlorine monoxide. The chlorine is then free to repeat 
the process. 


ULTRAVIOLET RAYS 



Damage to Stratospheric Ozone Allows UV-B Penetration 

The ozone in the stratosphere blocks most of the ultraviolet-B radiation from the sun, thus 
preventing it from damaging plants and animals. Without the protection of stratospheric 
ozone, piants and animais are exposed to damaging ievels of UV-B. 

50 












R-134a 

For this reason, a new refrigerant, R-134a, has been deveioped. it does not contain chio- 
rine (it’s a “hydrofiuoro-carbon,” or “MFC”), it causes much iess damage to stratospheric 
ozone.

REFRIGERANT HANDLING CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 


EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENT 


Since Jan. 1, 1993, any technician servicing, repairing, or opening a motor vehicle air con¬ 
ditioning system “for consideration” - anything other than free service- must use either 
refrigerant recovery/recycling or recovery-only equipment approved by the EPA. 

There are certification requirement for the technicians and the equipment; there are aiso 
record-keeping requirements. 

TECHNICIAN TRAINING/CERTIFICATION 


Technicians using approved equipment must be trained and certified by an EPA-approved 
organization, such as your BMW training center. To be certified, technicians must pass a 
test demonstrating their knowledge in the use of recyciing equipment in compiiance with 
SAE Standard J1989, the reguiatory requirements, the importance of referant containment, 
and the effects of ozone depletion. 


EQUIPMENT CERTIFICATION 

The equipment owner or another 
responsible officer must certify 
(report) to the EPA that they own 
approved equipment. The informa¬ 
tion provided must include the 
name, address, and telephone 
number of the establishment where 
the recovery/recycling equipment is 
located; the name brand, model 
number, year and serial number(s) 
of the equipment acquired for use 
at the establishment; and the signa¬ 
ture of the person who acquired the 
equipment (the owner or another 
responsible officer), certifying that 
they have acquired the equipment , 
that each individual authorized to 
use the equipment is properly 
trained, and that the information 
provided is true and correct. 



55 




RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS 


If the refrigerant is recovered and sent to a reclamation faoility, the name and address of 
that facility must be retained. 

IMPORTANT DATES 


Jan. 1, 1992: Since this date, containment and recycling of R-12 have been required. 

Nov. 14,1994: Since this date, the sale of refrigerant in any size container is restricted to 
certified technicians. 

July, 1995: Since this date, any R-12 mobile air conditioning system that is converted to 
use an acceptable alternate refrigerant must have the appropriate unique service fittings 
and label for that refrigerant. 

Nov. 15, 1995: Since this date, recovery and recycling of any substitute substance for R- 
12, such as R-134a, used in a motor vehicle air conditioner have been required.

RECOMMENDED REFRIGERANT RECOVERY, RECYCLING, EVACUATION, AND 
CHARGING EQUIPMENT 


A proper system charging station inciudes the foilowing components: 



Kent-Moore ACR3 
Recovery/Recycling Station 



• A manifold gauge set. 

• A charging cyiinder. 

• A bulk refrigerant supply tank. 

• A vacuum pump. 

• Hoses for connection to the automotive 
A/C system. 

• An electronic ieak detector. 

• A thermometer. 

This setup wiil ailow you to evacuate and charge 
an /VC system. 

For handiing R-12 refrigerant, use an R-12 recy¬ 
cling unit (such as the Kent-Moore ACR”). 

For R-134a refrigerant, a different unit is used (the 
Kent-Moore ACR“). These units filter and remove 
moisture the refrigerant, before discharging it into 
a recovery tank. 


ACR" Recovery/ 
Recycling Station 


57 










































































Never use any R-12 service tool, such as nrianifold gauge sets, on R-134a systenns. Tools 
retain snnall announts of refrigerant and lubricant. Attennpting to use the same equipment 
on both R-12 and R-134a vehioles will oontaminate the air oonditioning systems. Manifold 
gauge sets must be oonstructed of the proper hose material and fitting to be compatible 
with R-134a. Compatible units should be labeled be appropriately. 

When servicing is completed, the protective sealing caps must always be reinstalled to 
prevent contamination via the servioe fittings. 

The R134a system (early models) uses a standard sight glass to view the refrigerant 
charge. The sight glass view may turn “cloudy” if the wrong oompressor oil is used.

LEAK DETECTORS 



Typical Leak Detector 

R-12 and R-134a systenns use different leak detectors. An R-12 leak detector will not 
detect R-134a leaks (R-134a molecules are much smaller than R-12 molecules). However, 
an R-134a leak detector will detect R-12 leaks (be sure to follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions carefully to avoid contamination). 

An R-12 leak detector uses a very sensitive pickup which indicates the presence of Freon 
when placed below the leak: a white light illuminates or a warning buzzer sounds. It is 
easier to find a leak with the engine off, provided the pressure in the A/C system is 70-80 
psi overall (slightly overcharged). 

Always check for leaks with the engine off. The radiator fan of a running engine will circu¬ 
late the refrigerant around making the leak point difficult to locate. 

To check the evaporator, put the leak detector in the drain of the housing or in the center 
dash vent. 

An R-134a leak detector has been tested and approved by BMW, TIF 5550. It automati¬ 
cally calibrates after it is turned on, and it detects leaks as small as 0.40 oz. of R-12 or R- 
134a per year. 

BMW does not recommend the use of dyed refrigerant for finding a leak. The dyes can 
sometimes impair system operation and and may damage the interior fabrics of the car. 


59 



TEMPERATURE SENSING EQUIPMENT 


Correct climate control diagnosis requires an accurate and reli¬ 
able temperature sensing device. A high quality analog ther¬ 
mometer or a digital pyrometer is recommended. 

TYPICAL USE: A/C PERFORMANCE QUICK CHECK 

Test conditions = 90°F & 50% Humidity 

• Note ambient temperature 

• Close all windows and doors. 



• Engine Speed = 1500-2000 RPM. 

• Blower Volume = Medium Speed 

• Temperature Wheel = “Max Cold 

• “Snowflake” Button = A/C On 

• Test conditions > 3 minutes 





• Center vent discharge = . 20°F less than the ambient temperature. 


60 




























































































































DIS TEMPERATURE PROBE 


The Diagnosis and Information System (DIS) tester is equipped with a temperature sensor 
cabie, stored in the oompartment at the rear of the tester. It can be used to measure the 
temperatures of liquids and gasses from -20° to 200°C. 



• Select “Temperature C” 
button on the “Measuring 
System Muitimeter”

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS 



Always Use Eye Protection and Gloves 

The following safety precautions should be observed when working on an automotive 
refrigeration system: 

• Always wear eye protection and gloves while handling refrigerant or servicing an 
air conditioning system. 

• Avoid breathing R-134a vapor or mist; exposure may irritate eyes, nose, throat, 
and lungs. 

• If refrigerant or compressor oil contacts the skin or eyes, rinse the affected area 
with warm water, administer first aid immediately, and consult a doctor. 

• Use only approved service equipment to discharge A/C systems. 

• If an accidental discharge occurs, ventilate the work area. 

• Store refrigerant service equipment and bulk supply containers in a cool, dry 
location away from direct sunlight and other heat sources (<113° F, (45° C)). 

• Do not expose refrigerants to an open flame, since burning refrigerant can pro¬ 
duce poisonous gas. This includes open flames (such as in a propane leak 
detector), portable heaters, and lit cigarettes. 

• Do not pressure-test service equipment or vehicle A/C systems with an air/R- 
134a mixture. Some mixtures of air and R-134a are combustible at elevated 
pressures. The use of compressed air for leak detection in an R-134a system 
could result in a fire or explosion. 


62 



Do not disoharge refrigerant into the atmosphere; oontain it. R-134a is heavier 
than air; if discharged into the atmosphere, it can replace the air, causing suffoca¬ 
tion. If R-12 is discharged into the air it damages the environment. 

• Never weld or steam-clean any part of the air conditioning system. Heating the 
refrigerant in a ciosed system couid cause an explosion, due to the increased 
pressure. 

• Aiways consider R-12 or R-134a to be under high pressure, whether in the auto¬ 
mobile refrigeration system, service equipment, or refrigerant storage containers. 

• R-134a should only be handled by competent, informed personnel using 
approved procedures and equipment. Faiiure to do so may resuit in serious injury 
and/or substantial equipment or vehicle damage. 

• Removal of R-134a must be carried out using R-134a equipment that meets the 
requirements of SAE J2210. 

• If accidental discharge occurs, ventilate the work area before resuming service. 
Exposure to high concentrations of refrigerant vapor can induce anesthetic 
effects such as weakness, dizziness, and nausea. 


63 















The R134a service fittings are a unique design and prohibit the connection of non- 
approved equipment. The iarge diameter metric fitting is the high side (aiso sight glass) 
while the smaller diameter fitting is the low side. 


HIGH PRESSURE FITTING 



LOW PRESSURE FITTING 


The ACR4 unit has approved 
quick disconnect hose connec¬ 
tors which correspond to the spe¬ 
cial R134a service fittings found 
on the vehicle. This arrangement 
prevents the accidental connec¬ 
tion of R12 service equipment. 
No attempt should ever be 
made to bypass these special 
fittings 

Refer to S.I.B. # 641392 (3646) 
for nominal air conditioning 
system pressures R12/R134a

NON-APPROVED AIR CONDITIONING REFRIGERANTS 


Recently, “alternative” refrigerants for automatic air conditioning have been marketed in 
certain areas. These refrigerants are claimed to be compatibie replacements for the BMW- 
approved R-12 refrigerant (also known as Freon ). The “alternative” refrigerants usuaily 
oonsist of a mixture of various oomponents; among then may be R-12, R-22, R-142b, R- 
176, isobutance, propane or ammonia. 

These refrigerant components are not reiated to, and not as eooiogioaily sound as, the 
new R-134a refrigerant. 

THIS TYPE OF “ALTERNATIVE” REFRIGERANTS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH, AND 
NOT APPROVED FOR USE IN BMW AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS. 

Problems than oan occur when charging a BMW air conditioning system with an aiterna- 
tive mix or “biend”: 

1. R-22 is inoompatible with the existing R-12 desiccant found in BMW reoeiver-dryers. 
The desiocant wiii break down, and may be distributed through the A/C system, ciog- 
ging the expansion valve and destroying the oompressor. Some products use 
“sealants” which can ciog orifices in both the vehiole and reoyoling equipment. 

2. R-22 oan result in substantiaiiy higher pressure when installed in a system designed for 
R-12, espeoiaiiy in stop-and-go traffio in high ambient temperatures. 

3. Current R-12 hoses, 0-rings and sealing materiais found on BMW vehicies are not 
designed to, and do not, retain R-22. The R-22 permeates out of the hoses. If the R- 
12 is then iost from the system, the remaining R-142b is flammable. 

4. If a vehicle with a non-approved refrigerant is brought into a shop and conneoted to 
reoyoling equipment, the same problems can occur with the recycling equipment. In 
addition, the “alternative” refrigerant oan be passed on to other vehioles that are oon- 
neoted to the same reoyoling equipment. This could spread the problems to other 
vehicles. 

5. Materials such as propane and isobutane are flammable. If the proper pressure and 
charge conditions are not maintained, these oomponents “fractionate” out of the mix¬ 
ture. While the blended components may not be flammable, the individual oomponents 
may be flammable if the mixture has fraotionated.

6. Automotive A/C systems are subjeot to Federal law, as well as specifio state require¬ 
ments. Currently, 10 states and the Distriot of Columbia have enacted requirements 
that generally follow SAE definitions and requirements. The SAE J639 standard 
requires that “...Blend refrigerants, both in the original composition and in the composi¬ 
tions created as a result of normal mobile air-conditioning operating conditions, must 
meet the previous [ASHRAE 34-78] criteria: low toxicity, nonflammable, and nonexplo¬ 
sive requirements.” 

7. Blend refrigerants often require costly special processing to recycle. Since they cannot 
be vented to the atmosphere, servicing the system requires removal of the material into 
dedicated containers and shipping the material to a processing center for reclamation 
or destruction. The shipping must be done according to state and federal regulations, 
and the material is classified as a flammable gas for shipping purposes. 

Solution: 

There are currently no BMW-approved alternative refrigerants to R-12 or R-134a. 

Use of any refrigerant other than R-12 or R-134a will preclude warranty coverage of result¬ 
ing failures. 

Protect your customer’s air conditioning systems as well as your own recycling equipment. 

Do not allow non-approved refrigerants to enter your recycling equipment. 

If a customer has had air conditioning service performed elsewhere, determine that only 

approved refrigerant was used for recharging the system. This Service Information can be 

used to explain potential problems to customers. 

SYSTEM CONVERSION 

WHEN TO RETROFIT 


As long as R-12 is available, it should be used to service a vehicle with an R-12 system. 
When R-12 supplies are unavailable, the customers may be willing to pay for a retrofit. 

STANDARD RETROFIT 


To achieve the most effective system retrofit, follow the instructions in Service Information 
Bulletin # 64 01 95 (4179). Retrofit kits have been developed for the E31, E32, E34, and 
E36 models, to provide comparable system performance. The kits include a new receiv¬ 
er/dryer, hoses, service fitting, refrigerant controls, and other parts.

VERIFIED SYSTEM MALFUNCTION FOLLOW-UP 


After verifying that the complaint is actually a system malfunction, make the following 
“basic” checks: 

VISUAL CHECKS 

• Coolant level, coolant hoses in perfeot condition and all drive belts tensioned properly. 

• A/C oondenser, radiator, and system miorofilters clean and unobstructed. 

• Auxiliary cooling fan operates with A/C on and rotates in the correot direotion. 

• Interior flow-through ventilation functions correctly, vent flap valves behind rear bumper 
open with interior overpressure. 

DIS TESTER CHECKS 


• Instrument oluster temperature gauge and Engine Control Module temperature value 
Indloate engine coolant temperature is normal. 

• IHKR/IHKA has no faults In memory and the system is not operating with stored substi¬ 
tute values. 

• Water valves open/close correctly, heater core temperature sensors Indloate that the 
heater cores oool down on system oue. 

• Outlet flaps operate correotly, aotual air discharge locations agree with tester indioated 
flap open/closed positions. 

• A/C compressor olutoh energizes on system cue with engine running. (Many systems 
will not energize the oompressor clutch with the ignition switched on, engine not run¬ 
ning.)

BASIC TROUBLESHOOTING 


• Always personally verify the customer complaint. 

• Always verify that the complaint is truly a system malfunction. 

• Perform a Quick Test to determine if the vehicle systems have logged fault codes. 

• Call the faulted system or appropriate test schedule to verify the correct control module 
Is installed in the car. 

• Follow the Diagnostic Information System (DIS) on screen instructions and perform all 
tests as specified. 

• Use the DIS and fault symptom diagnostic procedures as trained. 

• Follow the appropriate test module procedures for systems that malfunction but fail to 
set faults in memory. 

• System problems which elude diagnostic procedures must be brought to the attention 
of BMW of North America, Inc.
