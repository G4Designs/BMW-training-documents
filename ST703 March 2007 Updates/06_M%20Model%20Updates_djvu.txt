Automatic Soft Close Function 


Introduction 

The E60 M5 and E63/E64 M6 will be equipped with the automatic soft close function 
on the doors as option 323 and will be available from March 2007 production. 

The automatic soft close function requires the installation of suitable door locks with 
drives for automatic soft close (SCA drives). 

The particular feature of this automatic soft close function is that the door lock and the 
automatic soft close drive are no longer a single unit, as was previously the case. The 
automatic soft close function drive is separate and controls the door lock by way of a 
bowden cable. 

This means that the lock and the drive can be fitted separately and the installation space 
available can be used to the best effect. 

If the automatic soft close option is ordered, it is installed on all the doors on the vehicle. 


The benefit of the automatic soft close function is that the doors only have to be pushed 
or pulled lightly into the lock. This action starts the automatic soft close function which 
closes the doors fully.

Principles of Operation 

The automatic soft close function is an independent (stand-alone) function. The only 
connection to the car's electrical system is terminal 30g and the earth connection. The 
automatic soft close function is ready for use from "terminal 30g ON".

The electronics for controlling and monitoring the function are located in the automatic 
soft close function drive. 


The sensors for the automatic soft close function are Hall sensors and are found in the 
lock. The Hall sensors are built into the lock of each vehicle door. One Hall sensor is for 
the locking pawl, the other for the rotary striker. 

The automatic soft close function analysis the status of the Hall sensors. The automatic 
soft close function drives are activated or moved back to their starting position, depend¬ 
ing on their current status. 

The automatic soft close function drive is connected to lock byway of a Bowden cable 
and a 4 wire cable.

Locking Procedure 

(When door is pushed into the lock starting position) 

Door open, the automatic soft close function is in the standby position. 

When the door is closed normally, first the locking pawl (lock) Hall sensor changes its sta¬ 
tus. The electronics in the automatic soft close function drive start the door closing oper¬ 
ation after a delay of 200 ms. This prevents the automatic soft close function drive start¬ 
ing before the lock bolt is located in the rotary striker. 

The drive operates the rotary striker byway of the Bowden cable until the Hall sensor for 
the rotary striker changes its status. The locking pawl is then engaged and secured in the 
rotary striker. Control over the automatic soft close function drive is then withdrawn and 
the automatic soft close function drive moves to the parked position. 

When the door is opened using the outside door handle (bow handle) or inside door 
handle, the system runs back to its original position. This is also known as the standby 
position. 

Note: Only when the rotary striker sensor has changed its status is the rotary 
striker mechanically locked by the locking pawl. This is particularly 
important, as only then is it guaranteed that the door is truly closed.

Closing the Door by Slamming 

Slamming the door would make closing with the automatic soft close function drive 
unnecessary. Since it must, however, be ensured that the door is truly locked, the auto¬ 
matic soft close function drive is nevertheless still operated for safety reasons. 

The electronics in the automatic soft close function drive detect the slamming of the 
door by the fact that the Hall sensors in the locking pawl and the rotary striker have 
changed their status within a brief period. 

Anti-repeat Circuit 

Every automatic soft close function drive has an anti-repeat circuit to prevent overheating 
of the automatic soft close function drive. It permits 15 operations (counter incremented 
up to 15 times) of the control for the automatic soft close function drive. 

The automatic soft close function drive is then locked electrically for approximately 
2 minutes.

Light closing causes the advance detent tooth (3) of the rotary striker (1) to engage on 
the locking pawl (6). The automatic soft close function drive pulls on the actuating lever (5). 

The actuating lever rotates the rotary striker by means of the pull latch (4) until it is rotated 
over the main detent tooth (7). The locking pawl can now engage in the main detent 
tooth of the rotary striker. The rotary striker is thus secured and the lock can no longer

Drive motor 


The automatic soft close function drive motor (6) has a two-start worm (4) on its shaft. 
This permits drive in the CLOSE direction for the automatic soft close function. The 
rotary motion of the drive worm is transferred to the driven wheel (3) by the idler gear (5). 
The drive gear transfers the rotary motion to the Bowden cable (1). This means that the 
actuating lever in the lock is pulled by the Bowden cable and thus the vehicle door is fully 
closed.

Service Information 


The lock and the automatic soft close function drive are a closed unit (modular). This 
means that a faulty lock or automatic soft close function drive cannot be replaced individ¬ 
ually. 

Opening the drive, for instance, destroys it, and perfect operation is no longer guaran¬ 
teed. The automatic soft close function drive is inseparably fastened to the lock. Only 
the lock and the automatic soft close function drive can only be ordered as a spare 
part together. 

Note: There is no diagnostic function for the automatic soft close function drive 
in the diagnostics system. Retrofitting the automatic soft close function 
is only possible with great effort and is thus not foreseen.

BMW Enhanced Premium Sound System 


The BMW Enhanced Premium Sound System (SA 752) positioned over the Top-HiFi 
system will be offered in the vehicles of the E60 M5, E63 M6 model series as from 
March 2007. 


The sound system consists of 16 speakers (7x tweeter, 7x mid-range speaker, 2x central 
bass supplied by LPG) in connection with the high-end audio amplifier manufactured by 
Lear). 

The 4 speakers in the rear window shelf will not be installed on the E64 M6 convertible. 
This model will receive only 12 speakers. 


The systems differ in terms of the speakers and their installation locations. A special 
feature of the BMW Enhanced Premium Sound System (SA 752) is the freguency 
diplexers/crossovers (supplied by LPG) installed in the two front doors. 


They separate the high and medium range much 
more accurately and with better sound results than 
when using an individual capacitor as in the 
Top-HiFi system; SA 677. 



Due to space limitations, the freguency diplexers/crossovers are installed only in the front 
doors. A capacitor is used as the freguency diplexerfor all other mid-range speakers and 
tweeters.
