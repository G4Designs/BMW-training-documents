1. Introduction 


As part of BMW EfficientDynamics, the BMW Group began early on to develop a wide variety of mea¬ 
sures for promoting efficiency. These measures have since been implemented across the entire model 
line and are included as standard equipment. 

BMW ActiveHybrid is an important module within the development strategy of BMW EfficientDynam¬ 
ics and is based on the modular principle "Best of Hybrid". It enables integration of the optimum com¬ 
ponents for each of the different vehicle classes. The primary development objectives are, on the one 
hand, a considerable increase in efficiency, i.e. a reduction in fuel consumption of up to 20 percent in 
the legally mandated consumption test cycle with lower CO 2 emissions compared to BMW models 
with a conventional engine. On the other hand, the BMW Group wants to offer the most dynamic hy¬ 
brid vehicle in the competitive environment. 



ActiveHybrid 7 

On the heels of the ActiveHybrid X6, in spring 2010 BMW launched its second series-production vehi¬ 
cle with hybrid technology, the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 (F04). Unlike all the other hybrid vehicles currently 
available on the market, the ActiveHybrid 7 is characterized by the fact that, in addition to high efficien¬ 
cy, it delivers equally great performance and agility-thereby providing the ultimate benchmark when it 
comes to vehicle dynamics amidst the competition. 

The powertrain of the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 includes an especially tuned (gasoline powered V8) N63 
engine with 450 hp/330 kW (5500 - 6000 rpm) supplemented by an electric motor with 20 hp/15 kW 
(900 - 4500 rpm) located inside the transmission bellhousing. The maximum power output is 455 
hp/342 kW (5500 - 6000 rpm) with a maximum torque of 515 Ib-ft (700 Nm). The electric motor in¬ 
creases overall power and reduces fuel consumption as it functions as a generator (during vehicle re¬ 
generative braking) to provide current back to the lithium-ion battery pack located in the trunk. The 
same electric motor is also used to start the gasoline engine, eliminating the need for a traditional 
starter. 

Although the motor relieves the load on the combustion engine and provides a supplemental power 
boost during certain acceleration situations, it cannot propel the vehicle by itself. This classifies the 
powertrain as a “mild hybrid”. Delivering 12-cylinder performance with 6-cylinder fuel consumption, 
the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 offers noticeably better performance (when accelerating from a standstill) 
and also has better low-end torque than the BMW 750i. The hybrid system has an excess weight of 
only about 165 lb (75 kg) compared with the conventional powertrain. The 8-speed automatic trans¬ 
mission has the same design as that of the BMW 760i/Li. The vehicle also incorporates a “stop/start” 
function, known as Auto Start/Stop. This system increases fuel efficiency by stopping the engine 
when the vehicle comes to a stop, without any driver interaction and restarting it when the driver con¬ 
tinues.

1. Introduction 


The F04 (short wheel base) accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds and the long wheel base ver¬ 
sion in 4.8 seconds. The overall combined fuel economy is a “preliminary” 20 mpg. The vehicle's CO 2 
emissions equate to a value of 219 grams per kilometer. It also complies with the American LEV-II ex¬ 
haust emission standards. 


1.1. Identifying features 


1.1.1. Exterior 

BMW ActiveHybrid vehicles differ externally from other BMW vehicles through various features. These 
include, the exclusive exterior color "Bluewater metallic", which signifies the innovative BMW Active- 
Hybrid technology. This primary exterior color (within the Series) is reserved exclusively for ActiveHy¬ 
brid vehicles. However customers can also choose other colors for their ActiveHybrid vehicles and or¬ 
der their ActiveHybrid 7 as a short or long wheelbase (ActiveHybrid 7 / ActiveHybrid 7L).

1. Introduction 


The rims of the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 have their own original look. Not only does the directional turbine 
blade shape look good, it also improves the car's aerodynamics (2 g/km fewer CO 2 emissions). 

The "ActiveHybrid 7" badge appears on the trunk lid. This wording is also featured on both C-pillars. 
The door sill strips featuring the "ActiveHybrid 7" wording enhance the appearance of the door entry 
area. In the luggage compartment the wording "ActiveHybrid Power Unit" is featured on the casing of 
the high-voltage battery.

1.2. Electric motor 



Electric motor and 8-speed automatic transmission in the F04 

The electric motor connected to the crankshaft and located between the combustion engine and the 
transmission develops 20 hp/15 kW and supports the 8-cylinder engine in driving off and accelerating 
with a torque of up to 155 Ib-ft (210 Nm). The electric motor also permits a reduction in fuel consump¬ 
tion by lowering the engine revs up to 600 rpm. It acts as a starter or generator, depending on the driv¬ 
ing situation. This is useful above all in heavy urban traffic, because it provides for a barely perceptible 
automatic engine start-stop function. In generator mode the electric motor generates electrical energy 
through coasting and brake energy regeneration, which is stored in the lithium-ion battery. The power 
output of the electric motor can increase up to 25.5 hp (19 kW) in this mode.

1.3. Lithium-ion battery 


Lithium-ion battery in the F04 

The technical highlight of the progressive mild hybrid drive is the highly efficient lithium-ion battery. 
Relatively new to the automotive industry, it has the highest energy density of all battery types. It is on¬ 
ly slightly larger than a conventional 12V battery and weighs only about 62 lb (28 kg). Because of its 
compact volume it has been incorporated in the installation space of the (optional) rear air conditioner 
and integrated in the vehicle. The lithium-ion battery has a capacity of 0.9 kWh and is ideally suitable 
for use in mild hybrid vehicles, which because of their design do not need a more powerful battery. The 
BMW ActiveHybrid 7 and the Mercedes-Benz S 400 Hybrid are the world's first hybrid vehicles to fea¬ 
ture this particularly powerful battery technology.

1.4. Driving situations 

1.4.1. Automatic engine start-stop function 



ActiveHybrid 7 


As the BMW ActiveHybrid X6 the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 is also equipped with an automatic engine 
start-stop function in conjunction with an automatic transmission. The automatic engine start-stop 
function switches off the combustion engine when at idle, for example, at a red light or in a traffic jam. 
This means that the engine is not emitting CO 2 and fuel consumption is reduced. While the vehicle is 
at a standstill the high-voltage battery supplies power for climate control, vehicle lights, etc. If the state 
of charge of the high-voltage battery is not sufficient to cover these loads, the combustion engine is 
started to charge the high-voltage battery using the electric motor and provide enough electrical ener¬ 
gy to power the various consumers. 

For the first time the climate control system can continue to run even when the combustion engine is 
switched off, because the climate control is supplied with power directly via the high-voltage electrical 
system from the lithium-ion battery. This energy management concept facilitates the operation of the 
independent (parked-car) air conditioning, which when required, can be set up to cool the interior of 
the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 to a significantly lower temperature before the customer enters the vehicle. 

1.4.2. Driving off 

When the driver's foot comes off the brake pedal, the combustion engine is quickly started and with 
minimal vibration. When the Automatic Hold function is activated the combustion engine is started on¬ 
ly when the accelerator pedal is pressed. 

Power development begins just above idle speed. The resulting dynamic response is further rein¬ 
forced by the additional drive torque developed by the electric motor. The response to the accelerator 
pedal of the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 (especially when driving off from a standstill) produces an acceler-

1. Introduction 


ation performance thus far unmatched neither by other combustion engine vehicles nor by any com¬ 
petitor hybrid model. Accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h (62mph) in 4.9 s places the F04 among the per¬ 
formance of the top-class sports cars. 

A newly developed hydraulic pressure accumulator ensures an accelerated build-up of transmission 
fluid pressure in the 8-speed automatic transmission that enables the vehicle to drive off very quickly 
just after starting the engine. 


1.4.3. Steady driving 

While the vehicle is driving on the combustion engine the electric motor can (depending on the driv¬ 
ing speed and the state of charge of the battery) be operated in different modes. Combustion engines 
do not operate at maximum efficiency when required to propel the vehicle at low to medium speeds. 
The electric motor, in contrast, is capable of delivering full torque at very low rpm. When the high-volt¬ 
age battery is sufficiently charged, the electrical energy can be drawn from the battery in order to place 
the combustion engine in a more favorable load range and thereby optimize its efficiency. A combus¬ 
tion engine can operate at maximum efficiency when the vehicle is being driven at a steady, relatively 
high speed. At this end of the performance band the electric motor would have to draw too much ener¬ 
gy from the high-voltage battery, therefore, the combustion engine is the primary driving source under 
these conditions. If the high-voltage battery is in a low state of charge, part of the power developed by 
the combustion engine is used to recharge the battery through the electric motor. 

1.4.4. Acceleration 

The particular advantage of the electric motor lies in its spontaneous and strong performance when 
driving off. The driver gets a impressive sense of this when accelerating or overtaking another vehi¬ 
cle. When sharp acceleration is needed from a complete stop, to overcome a steep gradient or to pass 
slower traffic, if the high-voltage battery is sufficiently charged, its power can be tapped and the ad¬ 
ditional force made available as kinetic energy through the electric motor. This is known as the boost 
function. The combination of the power outputs of the combustion engine and the electric motor 
achieves levels of driving dynamics and powerful acceleration normally encountered in vehicles with 
larger more powerful engines. The electric motor acts here like a kind of "electric turbocharger", which 
also supports the combustion engine when accelerating and does so without additional fuel consump¬ 
tion. 


1.4.5. Brake energy regeneration 

When the driver's foot comes off the accelerator pedal, the electric motor acts as a generator to gen¬ 
erate electric power without consuming fuel. Like a bicycle dynamo, it converts the kinetic energy of 
the rolling vehicle into electrical energy. The high storage capacity of the high-voltage battery makes it 
possible to take advantage of the energy recovery potential. 

The ability to utilize the kinetic energy that would otherwise be shed on descents or wasted when the 
car is decelerating is one of the main advantages of a hybrid drive. Instead of the energy only being 
converted into heat at the brakes, it is converted by the electric motor (which functions as a generator) 
into electrical energy and stored in the high-voltage battery. This energy, which can be reused later, 
does not have to be generated by the combustion engine. If the driver brakes lightly, the electric motor 
generates even more power and acts like an engine brake. This is known as recuperation or regenera¬ 
tive braking. The mechanical/hydraulic brakes do not need to work until stronger braking is required.

1. Introduction 

1.5. Cooperation 

In order to bring various concepts with innovative solutions to market faster, the BMW Group worked 
in cooperation with two other manufacturers. From this union arised components for different hybrid 
concepts that allowed the use of a modular system for developing drive concepts tailored to the re¬ 
spective vehicle types and that have a high savings potential. 

For the full hybrid vehicle, the ActiveHybrid X6, Chrysler, Daimler and General Motors participated 
within the "Global Hybrid Cooperation". 

The hybrid components used in the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 come from the cooperation between BMW 
and Daimler. The purpose of this cooperation is to develop and test components which are used as hy¬ 
brid drives for luxury performance vehicles. Apart from the electric motor and the lithium-ion battery, 
the power electronics for the high-voltage electrical system of the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 also emerged 
from this cooperation. The manufacturers integrate the hybrid components into the respective vehi¬ 
cles in accordance with individual, brand-specific requirements. This original characteristic is exem¬ 
plified in the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 by its combination of an 8-cylinder engine with an electric motor. 
BMW ActiveHybrid is based on a modular principle which, following the "Best of Hybrid" strategy, en¬ 
sures perfect integration of the optimum components in various vehicle concepts. Thus the mild hy¬ 
brid concept of the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 is just as ideally tailored to the model-specific requirements 
as the full hybrid concept for the BMW ActiveHybrid X6. 

Through consistent use of common components, production plants and suppliers, the cooperation 
enables significant cost advantages, from which the customer also benefits. 


1.6. Technical data 

The ActiveHybrid 7 will only be available in a left-hand drive version. Its introduction will therefore not 
be worldwide, but instead limited to selected markets.

The F04 and F01/F02 differ not only in the technical data but also in the range of optional equipment 
offered. 

The most important optional equipment which is not offered in the F04 is briefly summarized below: 

• xDrive four-wheel drive system (installation location of the front differential is taken up by the 
power electronics) 

• Integral Active Steering 

• Dynamic Drive 

• Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function 

• Extended rear air conditioning (rear air conditioner, installation location is taken up by the lithi¬ 
um-ion battery)

2.1. Modified N63 engine 

2.1.1. Overview 

The N63B44O0 engine from the F01/F02 is used in the F04. 

The engine has however been modified in the following areas: 

• Engine management 

• Technical data 

• Auxiliary components 

• Belt drive 

• Cooling system 

The engine management DME (Digital Engine Electronics) in terms of its hardware is essentially the 
same as that in the F01/F02 (MSD 85), but has an additional CAN connection. As well as the PT-CAN 
and the PT-CAN2 the DME in the F04 also communicates via the Hybrid-CAN (H-CAN) with the elec¬ 
tric motor electronics. The DME software has been adapted to this new communication interface: The 
DME coordinates the two drives, i.e. the drive torque requested by the driver is (depending on the driv¬ 
ing situation) distributed to the combustion engine and the electric motor. 

The maximum power output and the maximum torque of the engine have been increased exclusively 
through adaptation of the software. The table below shows the difference in these data between the 
F01/F02 and the F04.

• 14V alternator (14 V electrical system is supplied with power by the high-voltage electrical 
system) 

• Mechanically driven A/C compressor (replaced by an electrically driven A/C compressor). 


2.1.2. Belt drive 

The omitted auxiliary components mean that the F04 N63 engine features a simplified belt drive (pic¬ 
tured below).

The combustion engine therefore only drives the mechanical coolant pump and the power steering 
pump with the aid of the belt. A poly-V belt is used instead of an elasto-belt as on the F01/F02. There¬ 
fore it cannot be tensioned either via the "revolver tensioning system", which is visible on the belt pul¬ 
ley on the torsional vibration damper. Instead the separate tensioning pulley must be used to tension 
the belt. The torsional vibration damper has been altered when compared with the N63 engine in the 
F01/F02. The reason for this is the greatly modified drivetrain in the F04, in which the electric motor 
has been integrated and because of which the vibrational behavior at the crankshaft has changed. 

2.1.3. Cooling system 

The F04 N63 engine has two separate cooling circuits (as F01/F02). One serves to cool the engine, 
while the other is a low-temperature cooling circuit which serves to cool the charge air (intercoolers), 
the engine management and the power electronics for the electric drive.

2.1.4. Engine cooling 

The main cooling circuit for engine also supplies the bearings of the turbocharger with coolant. A 20 W 
auxiliary coolant pump supports the mechanical main coolant pump and circulates coolant through the 
turbocharger even after the engine has been stopped.

Compared with the F01/F02 the engine cooling circuit of the F04 has been modified and instead is the 
same as that in the E72. Coolant is circulated through the bearings of the turbochargers and the trans¬ 
mission fluid-to-coolant heat exchanger via the suction side of the auxiliary coolant pump (this has im¬ 
proved transmission fluid cooling). As in the other models featuring the N63 engine this pump can run 
on even after the combustion engine has been switched off in order to dissipate the residual heat from 
the turbochargers. Depending on the situation, the pump may run for 15 to 20 minutes after the en¬ 
gine is tuned off. 

2.1.5. Low-temperature cooling circuit 

The low-temperature cooling circuit of the F04 is based on that of the F01/F02 with N63 engine. In 
the F04 It is also used for cooling the charge air and the DME but has the additional task of cooling the 
power electronics for the electric drive, referred to as "electric motor electronics (EME)". The low-tem¬ 
perature circuit of the F01/F02 has therefore been extended for the F04 to include this additional cir¬ 
cuit.

tion of its cooling demand.

The EME circuit is not directly connected to the coolant-to-air heat exchanger. Instead the expansion 
tank serves here as a mixer, i.e. the coolant from the EME cooling circuit dissipates thermal energy to 
the coolant in the expansion tank. Cooling of the EME can thus be controlled to a large extent inde¬ 
pendently of the charge air cooling circuit. Cooling of the charge air and the Digital Engine Electronics 
is not negatively affected by this. The coolant is first cooled in the coolant-to-air heat exchanger before 
flowing to the charge air coolers and the Digital Engine Electronics.

2.2. Electric motor 

2.2.1. Overview 

The electric motor is manufactured by ZF Sachs AG, the drive and chassis components division of the 
ZF Group. 

The electric motor is used in the F04 for the following functions: 

• Automatic engine start-stop function 

• Support of the combustion engine (boost function) 

• Brake energy regeneration 

The combustion engine of the F04 is started by the electric motor, this eliminates the need to use a 
conventional starter. 

The F04 does not have a conventional 14V alternator either, as the electric motor assumes this func¬ 
tion in conjunction with a DC/DC converter. 

The technical data of the electric motor are summarized in the table below.

The electric motor is a high-voltage component. The voltage is generated by the electric motor elec¬ 
tronics and reaches values in excess of 100 VAC depending on the operating status. The electric mo¬ 
tor electronics also assumes the task of regulating the electric motor during drive and generator oper¬ 
ation. 


2.2.2. Installation location 

The rotor of the electric motor is connected to the crankshaft of the combustion engine and to the 
torque converter of the automatic transmission. The arrangement of the drivetrain components is the 
same as that of a parallel hybrid. The torques of both drives, i.e. from the combustion engine and the 
electric motor, can act simultaneously on the transmission input shaft.

Because the F04 is a mild hybrid, 100% electric driving is not possible. Therefore, a clutch is required 
between the electric motor and the combustion engine. The rotational speeds of the crankshaft, the 
electric motor and the transmission input shaft are thus identical in all driving states. Consequently, 
the electric motor on the F04 always rotates in one direction. Unlike the electric motors (E machines) 
in the active transmission of the E72, the electric motor in the F04 cannot reverse direction. 

2.2.3. Design 

The most important components of the electric motor are: 


18 











F04 Complete Vehicle

• Rotor and stator 

• High-voltage connection 

• Temperature sensor 

• Rotor position sensor 

• Crankshaft sensor 


Rotor and stator 

A permanent-field synchronous machine which is designed as an outer rotor is used for the electric 
drive. "Outer rotor" means that the rotor is arranged with the permanent magnets arranged in a ring 
shape on the outside. The windings for generating the rotating field are located on the inside and form 
the stator.

Temperature sensor 

The windings of the electric motor must not exceed a temperature of about 392 °F (200 °C) during op¬ 
eration. The temperature is therefore representatively measured in one of the windings with the aid of 
a temperature sensor. A thermistor with negative temperature coefficient (NTC) is used for this pur¬ 
pose. 

The electric motor electronics uses voltage and current measurements to determine the resistance 
and calculates the temperature from these measurements. If the temperature of the windings ap¬ 
proaches the maximum permissible temperature (about 356 °F [180 °C]), the power output of the 
electric motor is reduced. This is a degradation for protecting the components and is controlled by the 
electric motor electronics. An appropriate Check Control message is displayed starting from a level of 
power reduction to alert the driver of this condition (see the chapter entitled "Displays and Controls" 
for more information).

Rotor position sensor 

The rotor position sensor senses exactly the position of the electric motor's rotor. In contrast to the 
crankshaft sensor, the rotor position sensor is also suitable for clearly determining the position within 
a quadrant. This is necessary for exact regulation of the electric motor, because the voltages must be 
generated at the stator windings to match the position of the rotor. This precise, high accuracy mea¬ 
surement would not have been possible with the crankshaft sensor. Instead, this is configured for high¬ 
er rotational speeds and exact driving speed measurement. 


21 

















F04 Complete Vehicle 

2. Powertrain 


The principle of the rotor position sensor is based on the change in the magnetic properties of the ro¬ 
tor. The outer surface of the rotor therefore features a sinusoidal (sine wave shaped) structure. The 
sensor element consists of two coils which are operated with AC voltage. When the rotor moves, the 
magnetic properties change. This gives rise to changing induction voltages and currents in the coils. 
The position of the rotor can be determined from these variations. 

The analogsensor signal is read in and processed by the electric motor electronics.

Note: The rotor position sensor can be replaced separately in a Service when prompted to do 
so by the ISTA diagnosis system test plan.

The rotor position sensor is mounted on the outside of the transmission housing.

Note: The rotor position sensor must always be removed before the automatic transmission is 
removed or even separated from the combustion engine. Otherwise the rotor position sensor 
will be damaged! 


To ensure that the rotor position sensor functions flawlessly, it is necessary to adjust it using the ISTA 
diagnosis system. In the course of the adjustment, mechanical tolerances are recorded so that the ex¬ 
act position of the rotor can be determined during subsequent operation. The electric motor electron¬ 
ics records and stores the data from the adjustment process. 

A 

The rotor position sensor must be adjusted when: 


22

• the rotor position sensor has been replaced, 

• the electric motor has been replaced, 

• the electric motor electronics has been replaced, or 

• if the bolts of the transmission housing, the electric motor or the rotor position sensor itself 
have been loosen. 


The adjustment is performed using the Service Function "Rotor position sensor adjustment" in the 
ISTA diagnosis system. 

The individual operations involved are: 

1 Start the Service Function "Rotor position sensor adjustment" 

2 Start the combustion engine and run at idle, engage the parking lock 

3 Start adjustment and wait until the Service Function confirms that the adjustment has been suc¬ 
cessful 

4 Close the Service Function and allow the car to return to sleep mode 

The test plan for the Service Function specifies the operations mentioned here. The instructions in the 
test plan must be followed to the letter. 

High-voltage connection 

The three voltages and currents for the electric motor windings are supplied via the high-voltage con¬ 
nection. The high-voltage connection connects the electric motor to the electric motor electronics. 
This is not a flexible line connection, but instead three rigid busbars which come out of the left side of 
the motor. Sheathed in plastic, the three busbars of the electric motor are brought through the starter 
flange of the engine block and are directly bolted to the three connections of the electric motor elec¬ 
tronics. 

A 

When connecting the busbars, it is essential to observe the correct tightening torque. 

Faults may result either by applying too much torque or too little torque to the busbar connections. If 
an excessively low tightening torque is applied, this may result in faults (unreliable electrical connec¬ 
tion). If excessively high tightening torque is applied (unacceptable deformation of the busbars) may be 
displayed.

The electric motor is a high-voltage component. Before working on the electric motor, it is essential to 
observe the electrical safety rules: 

• Disconnect the vehicle from the high voltage supply 

• Safeguard to prevent unintentional starting 

• Verify safe isolation from the high voltage supply.

Removal: Install centring bolts before loosening the mounting bolts on the stator and rotor. Secure 
the stator and rotor at a fixed distance to each other. This will prevent the stator and rotor from banging 
against each other and being damaged when the mounting bolts are removed. 

Installation: Do not remove the centring bolts until the rotor and stator have been secured with the 
mounting bolts. Otherwise the rotor and stator could bang against each other during installation and 
be damaged. 


A_ 

Analysis of defective parts: Removed high-voltage components such as the electric motor may have 
to be returned to the manufacturer for analysis. To enable the manufacturer to determine the exact 
cause of the failure, it is essential to handle the removed high-voltage components with care. Damage 
during removal and shipping must be avoided at all costs. 



High-voltage connection 

Secure the screws of the busbar contacts to the prescribed tightening torque. Both excessively high 
and excessively low tightening torque can produce a faulty contact and damage to components.

2.3. Modified GA8HP70Z automatic transmission 

The GA8HP70Z automatic transmission (introduced in the F07 with the N63 engine) is used in the 
F04 with a few modifications. 

These modifications are summarized here and are described in the following chapters: 

• Transmission housing 

• Torque converter 

• Hydraulic pressure accumulator 

• Adaptive transmission control 


2.3.1. General hardware requirements 

Compared with the GA8FIP70Z automatic transmission which is used in vehicles with convention¬ 
al drives, the transmission housing has been adapted for use in a hybrid powertrain. The front of the 
transmission housing has been lengthened to accommodate the electric motor. The greater length 1.8 
in (+47 mm) has also necessitated the use of additional reinforcements in the transmission housing. 
Hydraulic lines have been supplemented and modified inside the transmission housing in order to in¬ 
tegrate the hydraulic pressure accumulator into the hydraulics. These design modifications increased 
the weight of the F04 transmission by about 9 lb (4 kg) more than the GA8HP70Z transmission used in 
conventional vehicles. 

The hybrid drive of the F04 develops a maximum torque of 515 lb ft (700 Nm). Due to the significantly 
greater torque (compared to the conventional N63 engine torque of 450 lb ft/600 Nm) the torque con¬ 
verter and the planetary gear sets had to be reinforced. The other transmission components are al¬ 
ready designed to accommodate this maximum torque and therefore have not been modified (when 
compared with the version used in the F07). 


2.3.2. Hydraulic pressure accumulator 

Overview 

The F04 uses an automatic engine start-stop function which switches off the combustion engine 
when the vehicle is at a standstill. In the engine stop phases the transmission fluid pump is not driv¬ 
en, thus the fluid pressure supply ceases, the gearshift elements open, and there is no longer a trans¬ 
fer of power in the transmission. The drive off processes should always be dynamic and without a no¬ 
ticeable delay (especially in BMW vehicles). The combustion engine must start quickly (this is guaran¬ 
teed by the F04 electric motor), at the same time, in the automatic transmission the gearshift elements 
for driving off must still be engaged, while the engine is starting. This requires transmission fluid pres¬ 
sure, which cannot be built up quickly enough by the conventional mechanically driven transmission 
fluid pump while the engine is starting. 

Therefore a hydraulic pressure accumulator is used in the automatic transmission of the F04. The 
gearshift elements needed for driving off are supplied with the stored transmission fluid volume from 
the accumulator before the transmission fluid pump has built up sufficient pressure.

Electromechanical lock 


The hydraulic pressure accumulator consists of a hydraulic cylinder. The cylinder contains a piston 
which is moved against the force of a spring. The piston can be electromechanically locked in the ten¬ 
sioned position. The electromechanical lock incorporates locking balls, a tension spring, a release 
spring, and a solenoid. The solenoid is activated and deactivated by the electronic transmission con¬ 
trol. The wiring harness for the hydraulic pressure accumulator is laid inside the transmission housing. 

The cylinder of the hydraulic pressure accumulator is connected to the transmission's hydraulic sys¬ 
tem without valves connected in between. The hydraulic pressure accumulator simply contains an el¬ 
ement which functions as a throttle and non-return valve. The throttle limits the volumetric flow while 
the hydraulic pressure accumulator is being filled. The non-return valve allows the transmission fluid to 
flow through the throttle into the hydraulic pressure accumulator during the charging process. During 
the discharging process the transmission fluid flows not through the throttle, but instead unrestrict¬ 
ed through the now opening non-return valve back into the transmission hydraulic system. The non¬ 
return valve therefore does not serve, as one would assume, to maintain the pressure in the charged 
state. Instead, in the charged state, the transmission fluid in the hydraulic pressure accumulator is at 
zero pressure. The stored energy on the other hand is accumulated in the tensioned spring. 

Charging 

The hydraulic pressure accumulator is always subject to charging when the combustion engine is run¬ 
ning and the transmission fluid pump is working. During charging, transmission fluid flows through 
the throttle into the hydraulic cylinder. The throttle allows only a small volume of fluid to be drawn from 
the transmission hydraulic system so that the pressure level does not unintentionally drop. The trans¬ 
mission fluid pushes on the piston which acts against the spring force increasing the tension on the 
spring.

At the end of the charging process the piston slides over the locking balls up to the stop. The applied

locking is not yet in operation here. The hydraulic pressure accumulator is fully charged in this end po¬ 
sition. 


30 

























































































F04 Complete Vehicle

Locking 

When the combustion engine is switched off (while the hydraulic pressure accumulator is charged) 
the transmission fluid pressure drops causing the spring to be released slightly. This allows the piston 
to slide into the locked position. Here, the locking balls engage and the piston is mechanically held in 
place. 

The now activated solenoid in turn holds the inner slide in place so that the balls cannot enter the 
channels designated for releasing the lock. The electric power required for this is low (< 10 W). Fur¬ 
thermore it is only required while the combustion engine is switched off. Therefore the additional ener¬ 
gy consumption of the hydraulic pressure accumulator viewed over an entire driving cycle is very low.

Discharging 

When the combustion engine is started, as the driver wishes to drive off, the gearshift elements in the 
automatic transmission for driving off must be engaged. The hydraulic pressure accumulator supplies 
the transmission fluid pressure required for this during the discharging process. 

As the solenoid is deactivated, the inner slide (driven by the smaller spring) moves in the direction of 
the locking balls. This allows the balls to enter in the channels designated for releasing the lock, which 
in turn releases the piston. The spring (compressed during the charging process) exerts a force on the 
piston which pressurizes the transmission fluid inside the cylinder.

3 

Transmission fluid flows from the hydraulic pressure accumulator back into the 
hydraulic system of the automatic transmission 


The piston moves (in the graphic to the left) and thereby pushes the transmission fluid back into the 
transmission hydraulic system. The transmission fluid exits the cylinder through the now opened non¬ 
return valve and throttle. 

The oil volume forced back into the hydraulic system of the transmission is sufficient to engage the 
gearshift elements needed for the driving off process. This system is designed to provide the initial 
fluid pressure needed for the transmission to go into “Gear” at the moment just before the engine is 
started. As soon as the engine is started, the transmission fluid pressure is then again generated by 
the transmission fluid pump and the process is restarted. 

2.3.3. Modified functions 

The essential functionality of the adaptive transmission control, as used in all current BMW automatic 
transmissions, also applies to the GA8HP70Z automatic transmission in the F04. Some program parts 
and parameters have however been modified to cater for the special characteristics of the hybrid drive. 
These modifications are described below. 

Gear selection when decelerating 

When the driver takes his/her foot off the accelerator pedal, fuel injection into the combustion engine 
is cut off (overrun fuel cutoff). This creates a negative torque which, depending on the gradient being 
negotiated, results in a deceleration of the vehicle. It is also known as "engine drag torque". This en¬ 
gine drag torque is dependent on the revs of the combustion engine and it is greater at high revs than 
at low revs. Therefore the brake force acting on the vehicle is greater at high revs. 

Because of the gear ratios used, the brake force is also greater in low gears than in high gears. 


32 





































F04 Complete Vehicle 

2. Powertrain 


In vehicles with conventional drives, the service brake is complemented by a powerful "engine braking 
effect". Therefore the adaptive transmission control in these vehicles shifts one or more gears down 
when longer-lasting brake activation or downhill driving is detected. 

However, in vehicles with hybrid drives the braking effect of the combustion engine is not required to 
the same extent. Instead, in hybrid vehicles the aim is to use the electric motor to decelerate the vehi¬ 
cle whenever possible. Therefore, when the brakes are activated or longer downhill driving is detect¬ 
ed, the adaptive transmission control in the F04 does not perform any downshifts; instead it holds 
the high gear for as long as possible. In this way the engine drag torque is kept at a low level. To com¬ 
plement and aid the service brakes, the electric motor is operated as a generator and an electrical "en¬ 
gine braking effect" is thereby achieved. The kinetic energy recovered from the motion of the vehicle is 
stored in the high-voltage battery as electrical energy and used for propulsion later. 

Upshift curves 

The upshift curves of the automatic transmission are modified for the F04 and help to reduce fuel con¬ 
sumption. When accelerating at low load (< 30 %) the adaptive transmission control shifts into the next 
gear up earlier than in vehicles with conventional drives. A coupling rotational speed of about 900 to 
950 rpm is thus achieved. This applies to drive position D, the upshift curves of drive position S have 
not been modified. 

This results in a very low engine revs, even when driving at a constant speed, which helps to reduce fu¬ 
el consumption. As is customary with BMW vehicles, this increase in efficiency is not obtained at the 
expense of dynamics. When the driver requests powerful acceleration through the accelerator ped¬ 
al, the electric motor supports the combustion engine (whenever necessary). It works as a motor and 
thereby increases the total drive torque significantly. As a result the driver of an F04 experiences a 
surge of spontaneous power which is comparable to that of a vehicles with conventional powertrains 
while at lower engine revs and with lower fuel consumption. 


2.4. Shafts and rear differential 

Due to the lengthened transmission housing of the F04, a shorter drive shaft is installed. 

As shown in the table below, the F04 does not have the same rear differential as the F01 750i or the 
F02 750Li. The F04 uses the 235L rear differential, which is known from the F01 760i or the F02 
760Li. 

The longer gear ratio together with the modified upshift curves contribute to a low engine revs and 
thus enhanced fuel efficiency.

2.5. New automatic engine start-stop function 

2.5.1. Overview 

With the introduction of the F04 the automatic start-stop function is being used for the first time in a 
hybrid vehicle with automatic transmission. Prior to this the system, automatic engine start-stop was 
only used in manual gearbox 4 cylinder model BMW vehicles (not available in the US). With that ver¬ 
sion, when the vehicle is stopped, the driver engages neutral and releases the clutch pedal, the auto¬ 
matic start-stop function switches the combustion engine off. This means that the vehicle does not 
use any fuel when it is at a standstill. During this period the electrical consumers are supplied with 
power from the 12V battery. When the driver depresses the clutch pedal again, the combustion en¬ 
gine is automatically restarted and the driver can continue driving. In contrast to this, in the F04 sys¬ 
tem, the electrical consumers are supplied with power directly from the high-voltage electrical system 
while the vehicle is stopped. 

Note: Only those modifications and special characteristics of the automatic start-stop func¬ 
tion which are specifically applicable to the F04 are described in this document. 

2.5.2. Function from the customer's point of view

The purpose of the automatic start-stop function is to switch off the combustion engine when the ve¬ 
hicle is stopped. 

From the customer's point of view the stopping process with subsequent engine stop in the F04 is as 
follows:

Index Explanation 


3 Combustion engine is switched off, tachometer shows 0, the "Ready to drive" 

terminal status is indicated by a pulsating "Ready" display 


Vehicle slows to a stop, e.g. at a red light 


In the situation depicted above the driver holds the car at a standstill by depressing the brake pedal. If 
the driver has activated the "Automatic Hold" function, he/she can also release the brake pedal after 
the car has come to a stop. The car is then held at a standstill by the DSC hydraulics. The automatic 
start-stop function also switches off the combustion engine in this case as long as the car is stopped 
and the driver does not depress the accelerator pedal. 

Driving off 

In vehicles with automatic transmissions the driver signals his/her wish to drive off by releasing the 
brake pedal and then depressing the accelerator pedal.

If the driver held the vehicle at a standstill by depressing the brake pedal, the combustion engine is 
started as soon as the driver releases the brake pedal. If the vehicle was held at a standstill by the "Au¬ 
tomatic Hold" function, the combustion engine is started only when the driver depresses the accelera¬ 
tor pedal. 


2.5.3. Distributed function 

The Digital Engine Electronics is the master control unit for the automatic start-stop function. It reads 
in all the input signals and the switch-off inhibitors and switch-on prompts communicated by other 
systems. Based on this information, the DME decides when the combustion engine is to be switched 
off and restarted. 

Basically the combustion engine is switched off when in drive (position "D") the vehicle speed reach¬ 
es 0 mph and the car is held at a standstill. The vehicle speed is determined with the aid of the wheel 
speed sensors, the Dynamic Stability Control and the Integrated Chassis Management. Holding at 
a standstill is detected by reference to the brake light switch signal or to the status of the Automatic 
Hold function. Starting of the combustion engine always occurs automatically when the driver outputs 
the "not actuated" brake light switch signal or the accelerator pedal angle is greater than 0° (especially 
if the Automatic Hold function was previously activated). 

In addition to these generally applicable conditions there are several other situations which limit the 
automatic start-stop function. These conditions are listed in the following chapters. 

Several logically related conditions are summarized into groups in the following table. In the event of a 
customer complaint, an exact analysis of the system can be done using the ISTA diagnostic system. 

Switch-off inhibitors 

"Switch-off inhibitors" are conditions or states which prevent the combustion engine from being 
switched off, although the vehicle is stopped and is being held at a standstill.

Apart from in drive position "D" the combustion engine is only switched off in drive position "P". All the 
other gear positions are considered switch-off inhibitors. 

In addition to the switch-off inhibitors listed in the table one or more satisfied deactivation conditions 
of the automatic start-stop function result in the combustion engine not being switched off when the 
vehicle is stopped. 

Switch-on prompts 

If a "switch-on prompt" is present, this results in an advanced starting of the combustion engine, even 
though no signal has yet been displayed that would indicate that the driver wishes to drive off.

Deactivation conditions 

If a deactivation condition is present, the automatic start-stop function will neither automatically switch 
off nor start the combustion engine. The automatic start-stop function is therefore passive in this case. 
If the engine was switched off automatically before the onset of a deactivation condition, the driver 
must start it manually by depressing the brake pedal and pressing the Start/Stop button. In this case a 
Check Control message alerts the driver of the condition.

3. Hybrid Braking System 

3.1. System overview 

The main function of the braking system of the F04 is to decelerate the vehicle safely under stable 
conditions. It has the additional function of converting the vehicle's brake energy, that would otherwise 
be wasted as heat, into electrical energy with the use of the electric motor. 

Because the F04 is mild hybrid, the maximum power output and torque of the electric motor is lower 
than that as full hybrid vehicle such as, the E72. Accordingly the maximum braking deceleration, which 
can be regeneratively generated, is also lower. For this reason, the F04 and the E72 have very different 
hybrid braking systems. The following table provides an overview of these differences.

The properties of the F04 hybrid braking system described in the table were achieved by modifying 
the braking system of the F01. Primarily because the braking system of the F04 does not feature me¬ 
chanical decoupling of the brake pedal and brake servo (as on E72), it has been possible to adopt to a 
great extent the components of the F01 service brake. 

The following components are new or modified: 

• Brake master cylinder (plunger brake master cylinder) 

• Brake pedal travel sensor (on the brake master cylinder) 

• Brake servo (connection to the brake master cylinder) 

• Dynamic Stability Control (reading in of the signal from the brake pedal travel sensor) 

To implement regenerative braking, the following components (needed anyway for the hybrid drive) are 
required: 

• Dynamic Stability Control (reading in of the brake pedal travel signal and calculation of the re¬ 
generative set-point braking torque which is to be implemented by the drivetrain) 

• Digital Engine Electronics (forwarding of the regenerative set-point braking torque to the elec¬ 
tric motor electronics, if the status of drivetrain permits this) 

• Electric motor electronics (implementation of the set-point braking torque through activation 
of the electric motor as a generator, voltage transformation of the generated electrical energy) 

• Battery management electronics (provision of data for the energy absorption capacity of the 
high-voltage battery) 

• High-voltage battery (storage of the generated electrical energy)

3.2. Functions 

3.2.1. Hydraulic and regenerative braking 

In the F04 the components for hydraulic braking mode and those for regenerative braking mode op¬ 
erate virtually independently of each other. Basically, each time the brake pedal is depressed, there is 
a hydraulic portion and a regenerative portion. The hydraulic portion and its dependence on the brake 
pedal travel are determined by the design of the components. The regenerative portion is electronical¬ 
ly controlled as a function of the brake pedal travel amongst other marginal conditions.

Hydraulic braking 


When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a direct mechanical connection is established to the brake 
servo and thus to the hydraulic brake system. 


Activation is therefore carried out as in a conventional vehicle: 

• Brake pedal - mechanical connection - brake servo 

• Brake servo - pneumatic boosting - brake master cylinder 

• Brake master cylinder - hydraulic boosting and distribution into two brake circuits - Dynamic 
Stability Control 

• Dynamic Stability Control - driving dynamics control and electronic brake force distribution - 
wheel brakes

3. Hybrid Braking System 

Regenerative braking 

The accelerator pedal angle and the brake pedal travel are the decisive input variables for regenerative 
braking. The electric motor is operated as a generator when the brake pedal is not depressed but the 
accelerator pedal is already at an angle of zero degrees. The electric motor electronics activates the 
electric motor in such a way that a braking force is obtained which corresponds to a conventional vehi¬ 
cle in overrun mode (engine braking). The extent of energy regeneration at this point is still at a low lev¬ 
el. 

If the brake pedal is depressed at this time, initially (as in every conventional braking system) a “free 
play” travel must be overcome during which no hydraulic braking occurs. However, here this brake 
pedal travel is evaluated and a greater brake force (than that of overrun mode) is generated with the aid 
of the electric motor in response. 

If the brake pedal is depressed beyond the “response” travel, both brake modes are simultaneously 
active, because now hydraulic braking is added to regenerative braking. The brake force generated by 
the electric motor is increased even further as the brake pedal travel increases until it reaches the max¬ 
imum. The maximum brake force which is possible through regenerative braking corresponds on a lev¬ 
el road to a deceleration of 0.6 m/s 2 . 

Regenerative braking acts only on the rear axle of the F04 through the electric motor, automatic trans¬ 
mission and the rear differential. The brake force on the rear axle must not exceed a specific value in 
proportion to that on the front axle. This would otherwise compromise driving stability. For this reason, 
the maximum deceleration which can be achieved through regenerative braking is limited to 0.6 m/s 2 .

Distribution of hydraulically and regeneratively generated brake force 

When the electric motor is operated as a motor, it generates a torque in the drivetrain (in addition to 
that of the combustion engine). In generator mode the electric motor generates a braking torque in the 
drivetrain. This braking torque exerts a drag on the rear wheels which results in a brake force. 

The following diagram summarizes how the entire brake force is distributed into the hydraulic and re¬ 
generative portions. In the diagram it is presupposed that there is no unstable driving state and the 
high-voltage battery is able to store electrical energy.

3.2.2. Special states 

Regenerative braking with the aid of the drivetrain generates a longitudinal force on the rear wheels. 
Together with a straight-acting lateral force the resulting force must not be greater than the maximum 
transmittable force. Otherwise traction would be lost and handling would become unstable. Therefore 


46 
















F04 Complete Vehicle 

3. Hybrid Braking System 

the Dynamic Stability Control permanently monitors the slip at the rear wheels and from it calculates 
(among other things) information on the stability of the vehicle in the relevant driving situation. Brak¬ 
ing with the aid of the drivetrain is only permitted as long as the driving situation is stable. The Dynam¬ 
ic Stability Control takes into account this information when calculating the set-point value of the brak¬ 
ing torque which is to be generated with the aid of the drivetrain. 

If the high-voltage battery is fully charged, it cannot store any more electrical energy. This special state 
(which arises rarely) may be a reason why regenerative braking cannot be possible. A sufficiently large 
reserve in the state of charge of the high-voltage battery is maintained during normal driving by the op¬ 
erational strategy. In other words, energy is constantly drawn from the high-voltage battery intention¬ 
ally and thereby the state of charge is maintained in a range which makes available (even during longer 
instances of downhill driving) the capacity for the electrical energy to be generated during regenerative 
braking. 

Due to the principles involved, the electric motor cannot operate as a generator at very low engine 
revs. Shortly before standstill is reached the converter lockup clutch in the automatic transmission is 
also opened. These two factors are the reasons why regenerative braking is not possible shortly before 
standstill is reached. 

The following table summarizes the special states in which regenerative braking is possible only under 
limited conditions or is not possible at all:

3.3.1. Plunger brake master cylinder 

Tandem brake master cylinders are used in BMW vehicles. A special design, referred tp as a plunger 
brake master cylinder, is used in the F04. It offers the advantage of having a compact design and was 
chosen for the F04 because the sensor system for the brake pedal travel can be easily integrated.

On the F04 brake master cylinder the connection for the brake circuit (which leads into the pressure 
chamber of the pushrod piston) is in a slightly different position from that in the F01. For this reason 
the corresponding brake line in the F04 differs in length and shape from that in the F01. 

Because the brake master cylinders of the F04 and F01 also have different internal designs, the con¬ 
nection to the brake servo via the pushrod is different. For this reason the brake servo is also specific 
to the F04.

Note: The brake servo and the brake master cylinder are specific F04 components and there¬ 
fore have their own part numbers. They must not be mixed up with F01/F02 components.

The brake master cylinder incorporates a permanent magnet to record the brake pedal travel. Depress¬ 
ing the brake pedal moves not only the piston in the brake master cylinder, but also the permanent 
magnet via a drive plate and a pushrod. When the driver's foot comes off the brake pedal, a coil spring 
presses the permanent magnet back into its initial position.

The position of the permanent magnet is detected by an externally mounted sensor element. The sen¬

principle. The position of the permanent magnet is determined with the aid of two coils and an elec¬ 
tronic circuit which is integrated in the sensor housing. The same sensor principle is also used for ex¬ 
ample in the Sequential Manual Gearbox and in vehicles with manual gearboxes and the automatic en¬ 
gine start-stop function. 

The brake pedal travel sensor can be replaced as a separate component. There is a repair kit which al¬ 
so contains the mounting screws. 

A_ 

The tightening torque for the mounting bolts must be exactly as specified in the repair instructions and 
must not be exceeded! 

When replacing the brake pedal travel sensor, it is also necessary to observe the ESD safety rules and 
to protect the sensor against dirt contamination. 


3.3.2. Dynamic Stability Control 

The Dynamic Stability Control in the F04 is essentially the same as that in the F01/F02. Modifications 
have been made to the hardware of the DSC control unit and also to its software to comply with the 
hybrid brake system: 

• Brake pedal travel sensor: 

Provision of the supply voltage for the sensor and reading in of the sensor signal (modified 
control unit connector and expansion of the software) 

• Evaluation of parameters for driving stability to be taken into account in the calculation and 
distribution of the brake force: 

Wheel slip, ABS/ASC/DSC interventions, lateral acceleration and steering angle. 

• Calculation of the regenerative mode of the brake force which is to be generated by the drive- 
train and communication of this value to the Digital Engine Electronics.

Due to the introduction of hybrid technology the bus system of the F04 differ from the previous bus 
systems of BMW vehicles (F01/F02). All the main and sub-bus systems of the F01/F02 are also used 
in the F04. A new bus system has been added referred to as Hybrid-CAN (H-CAN). Compared with the 
bus systems of the F01/F02 some new control units have been added, some have had to be adapted 
and some are not installed in the F04 at all. 

The resulting bus structure of the F04 is as follows.

4. Bus Systems 

The function of the electric motor electronics (EME) is to activate and regulate the permanent-field 
electric motor in the high-voltage electrical system. This necessitates the use of a bidirectional inverter 
which converts the high DC voltage of the high-voltage battery into a three-phase alternating current 
for the electric motor. When the electric motor is running in generator mode the high-voltage battery is 
recharged via the inverter. 

The EME also incorporates the DC/DC converter which is responsible for the power supply to the low- 
voltage electrical system. The EME is connected to the PT-CAN and PT-CAN2. The EME exchanges 
information with the DME via the H-CAN. 


4.2.2. Hybrid CAN (H-CAN) 



Signal level on H-CAN 


A CAN bus is used in the F04 as an additional bus system for networking the control units which com¬ 
municate high levels of information (DME and EME). 

The data transfer rate on the hybrid CAN is 500 kbit/s. As with previously established CAN bus sys¬ 
tems the H-CAN is also designed as a twisted pair cable. The use of twisted pair cables helps to im¬ 
prove the electromagnetic compatibility of the bus systems. The signal levels on the H-CAN for a logi¬ 
cal "1" are: 

• CAN-H: 3.5 V 

• CAN-L: 1.5 V 

In the non-active bus the bus level of low and high is 2.5 V (logical zero). A logical 1 is transmitted with 
a voltage difference of 2 V. The H-CAN has emergency running properties, i.e. if one of the two bus ca¬ 
bles has been interrupted, the data continues to be transferred along the cable that is still intact.

4.2.3. Battery management electronics (SME) 



High-voltage battery in the F04 


The SME control unit is integrated in the high-voltage battery and executes (among others) the follow¬ 
ing functions: 

• Monitoring of the state of the lithium-ion battery 

• Control of the shut-off valve in the refrigerant circuit of the air conditioning for cooling the 
high-voltage battery 

• Monitoring of the high-voltage electrical system for insulation faults 

• Control of the switch contactors for activating the high-voltage system 

The SME control unit is connected to the PT-CAN2. 


4.2.4. Electric A/C compressor 

An electrically operated A/C compressor is used. To be able to deliver the necessary power, the elec¬ 
tric A/C compressor is operated with high voltage; it is a new BMW development. The electric A/C 
compressor enables the refrigerant of the hybrid car's air conditioning to circulate in all driving situ¬ 
ations. In addition to cooling the passenger compartment, the refrigerant circuit also cools the high- 
voltage battery. The electric A/C compressor control unit is mounted on the A/C compressor housing 
and is connected via the LIN bus to the integrated automatic heating / air conditioning (IHKA).

4.3.1. IHKA 

The software for the IHKA control unit has been adapted due to the use of the electrically operated 
compressor. For this purpose, the message cataloghas been expanded to include new messages. The 
IHKA control unit is also the LIN master for the electric A/C compressor. 


4.3.2. Instrument cluster 



F04 instrument cluster 


The hybrid-specific displays appear in the instrument cluster. For this purpose, the software of the in¬ 
strument cluster has had to be adapted. The display of the current (instantaneous) fuel consumption 
indicator is supplemented by hybrid displays. In addition, hybrid-specific Check Control messages are 
displayed. 


4.3.3. CIC 

The Car Information Computer (CIC) has been modified so that hybrid-specific displays can be indicat¬ 
ed in the Central Information Display (CID). By selecting "Hybrid" in the "Vehicle Info" menu it is possi¬ 
ble to display the energy and power flows for each driving situation and the state of charge of the high- 
voltage battery. 


4.3.4. DME 

The software of the Digital Engine Electronics (DME) has been adapted to effectively handle the 
torque coordination of electric motor and the combustion engine. The DME also has another H-CAN 
connection for connecting to the EME. 


4.3.5. DSC 

The DSC software has also been adapted for regenerative braking. This includes the reading in of the 
brake pedal travel sensor as a hardware interface.

4.3.6. ACSM 

Rollover detection is required for the hybrid vehicles (worldwide) so that in the event the vehicle rolls 
over, the high-voltage system is deactivated. Rollover detection is achieved with the aid of the central 
sensor with rollover detection. The central sensor with rollover detection was implemented in the F01/ 
F02 for the first time and is now fitted in all F04 vehicles. The ACSM was adapted with regard to the 
evaluation of the central sensor with rollover detection. 


4.4. Omitted control units 

The F04 does not have Active Steering, as the space for the Active Steering is needed in part by the 
EME. Because Integral Active Steering is only offered in combination with Active Steering, the control 
unit for rear axle slip angle control (HSR) is also omitted. 

The rear air conditioner (HKA) is not offered in the F04, as the space for it is needed for the high-volt¬ 
age battery. 

Because of the complex control and the low production numbers involved, ACC is not an available fea¬ 
ture in the F04 either.

5. Power Supply 

A bidirectional DC/AC inverter in the EME serves as the coupling element between the high-voltage 
electrical system with AC voltage (for the electric motor) and the high-voltage electrical system with 
DC voltage (high-voltage battery). The 14V electrical system of the F04 is essentially the same as the 
electrical system of the F01/F02. The main difference is that the power is no longer supplied by the 14 
V alternator, but by the DC/DC converter in the EME. The electric voltage supply of the 14V vehicle 
electrical system is thus no longer dependent on the speed of the combustion engine when driving. 
Another difference is that the combustion engine is started by the electric motor and the high-voltage 
battery instead of a conventional starter and 12V battery. 

The new control units are supplied with voltage via the following terminals:

5.1. Energy management 

The energy management of the F04 is regulated and coordinated by the high-voltage power manage¬ 
ment. The high-voltage power management regulates the energy flow on the high-voltage electrical 
system (AC and DC) as well as between the high-voltage and low-voltage electrical systems. The pow¬ 
er management for the low-voltage electrical system is based on the Advanced Power Management 
(APM) familiar from the F01/F02. Functions such as consumer reduction, consumer cutoff, electrical 
system diagnosis and 12V battery diagnosis are still integral to the APM. The APM is still integrated 
in the DME. The APM is subordinate to the high-voltage power management. The high-voltage power 
management is integrated in the EME. 

5.1.1. Vehicle starting capability 

The combustion engine in the F04 is not started with the assistance of the 12V battery, but instead 
with the high-voltage battery. The purpose of the 12V battery is only to ensure the powering up of the 
high-voltage system. The 12V battery is required to store a minimum SoC to protect the 12V battery 
against freezing at temperatures below 32 °F (0 °C) and to power up the high-voltage system. 

The ability to start the combustion engine is now ensured by the high-voltage operational strategy. 
When the vehicle has been parked or stored for an extended period, the SoC of the high-voltage bat¬ 
tery must be sufficiently high to restart the combustion engine, even after an immobilization period of 
six weeks. If the combustion engine cannot be started (after storing the vehicle for an extended peri¬ 
od) due to a low SoC of the high-voltage battery, the high-voltage battery must be charged by an ex¬ 
ternal 14 V charger and the DC/DC converter within the EME. Charging the high-voltage battery in this 
manner takes about 20 minutes. A sufficient state of charge (for starting the combustion engine) is ac¬ 
companied by the display of a yellow Check Control symbol and the corresponding text message in 
the CID. 


5.1.2. Starting aid 

The "starting aid" function ensures that the combustion engine can be started even if the SoC of the 
high-voltage battery is low. This involves energy being transferred from the 14 V electrical system 
to the high-voltage electrical system so that the SoC of the high-voltage battery is increased in or-

der to start the combustion engine. In order to protect the battery of the 14V vehicle electrical sys¬ 
tem against total discharge, this energy must be supplied by an external voltage supply (charger or via 
starting aid). 

The voltage of the external voltage supply must correspond to the voltage level of the 14V electrical 
system. The external voltage supply must remain connected for a period of time in order to charge the 
high-voltage battery, i.e. a direct engine start is not possible after the external voltage supply has been 
applied.

"Ready to drive" is a status of the vehicle while it is stopped, e.g. in a traffic jam or at traffic lights, in 
which the combustion engine is switched off, but the ignition remains switched on. The combustion 
engine starts automatically as soon as the brake pedal is released or when the Automatic Hold func¬ 
tion is activated the accelerator pedal is depressed. Another way of starting the combustion engine di¬ 
rectly from stopped is to turn the steering wheel to the left or right. "Ready to drive" is practically the 
status of the vehicle between terminal 15 and the combustion engine running. The prerequisites for 
activating the "Ready to drive" mode in the F04 is for the combustion engine to be at operating tem¬ 
perature and the state of charge of the high-voltage battery to be sufficient to supply the auxiliary con¬ 
sumers with power while the vehicle is stopped. 

Unlike conventional vehicles the "Ready to drive" status in a hybrid vehicle cannot be recognized by 
the combustion engine running. 


5.3. Reverse polarity protection 

Reverse polarity protection serves to avoid consequential damage to the vehicle electrical system and 
electronic components connected to it in the event of the polarity being reversed by the customer dur¬ 
ing an external start. The diodes in the alternator are generally used for this task. Because the conven¬ 
tional alternator is omitted from the F04, this task is performed by the DC/DC converter in the EME. In 
other words, the F04 does not have a separate reverse polarity protection module.

6.1. Overview 

The high-voltage battery unit is a complete system that contains not only the high-voltage battery it¬ 
self, but also the following additional components: 

• Electronic control unit, battery management electronics (SME) 

• Electromechanical switch contactors 

• Connections for high-voltage cables 

• Connections for low-voltage cables 

• Connections for refrigerant line and condensation drain line 

• Gas vent pipe 

The primary task of the high-voltage battery unit is to draw electrical energy from the high-voltage 
electrical system, store it and make it available again later as necessary. In addition, it assumes impor¬ 
tant tasks that contribute to the safety of the high-voltage system, such as the high-voltage interlock 
loop. The high-voltage safety connector (also called the "Service Disconnect") is not an integral part of 
the high-voltage battery unit in the F04. Instead it is located in the luggage compartment well near the 
12V battery. 

The system supplier of the high-voltage battery unit for the F04 is the company TEMIC Automotive 
Electric Motors GmbH. It was developed in a cooperation between BMW AG and Daimler AG.

tion of the rear air conditioner of an F02 with the optional equipment "Extended rear air conditioning". 
Although the F02 is not currently available in the US market with the optional equipment "Extended 
rear air conditioning" it is similar to the system used on the E66. The high-voltage battery unit is cov¬ 
ered by a panel and is therefore not directly visible. When this panel is removed the features and con¬ 
nections shown in the following graphic can be identified.

6.1.3. High-voltage battery 

The term "high-voltage battery" refers to the actual energy accumulator for the high-voltage system. 
The nominal voltage of 126 V is achieved by connecting 35 battery cells in series with a nominal volt¬ 
age of 3.6 V each. 

Each individual cell is cylindrical in shape and has access points for measuring the cell voltage. Situat¬ 
ed in the spaces between the cells are elements which absorb impacts and vibrations and thereby pro¬ 
tect the cells against mechanical damage. The cells are designed in accordance with lithium-ion tech¬ 
nology. This technology is characterized by the highest available energy and power density currently 
on the market.

Lithium-ion technology cells are sensitive to overloading, overvoltage, overcurrent and excess temper¬ 
ature. The cells are therefore monitored individually and in blocks. Electronic circuits located on one 
side of the cell block perform this monitoring task and permanently measure the voltage of each in¬ 
dividual cell and the temperature at four different positions. A heat sink which projects between the 
cells also serves to cool the cells. The cells are sealed with this heat sink during the manufacture pro¬ 
cess. The refrigerant is routed along the cells through channels in the heat sink. If an unacceptably 
high temperature or an unacceptably high pressure occurs in a cell, the housing of each cell has a pre¬ 
determined breaking point. Above this point the excess gas pressure in the cell can be decreased. The 
gases released in the process are discharged from the vehicle through the gas vent pipe. 

The high-voltage battery can be connected to or isolated from the high-voltage electrical system using 
the contacts of electromechanical switch contactors inside the high-voltage battery unit. These con¬ 
tacts are located on the positive terminal and the negative terminal, before the terminals are routed out 
of the high-voltage battery. The electromechanical switch contactors are activated by the battery man¬ 
agement electronics (SME). The supply voltage for the switch contactors is supplied through the bat¬ 
tery safety terminal.

Observe the safety data sheet for the high-voltage battery for all repair work on these components. 
Use the personal safety equipment prescribed there. If there is any uncertainty regarding a possible 
hazard, contact the technical support (PUMA) of the BMW Group. 


6.1.4. Battery management electronics 

High demands are placed on the high-voltage battery lasting the service life of the vehicle. To maxi¬ 
mize the service life of the high-voltage battery it is operated in a precisely defined range. 

This includes the following measures: 

• Protecting the cells against overheating (by cooling and/or limiting the current) 

• Adjusting the state of charge of the individual cells where necessary to one another 

• Not fully depleting the battery's amount of storable energy 

For this reason the high-voltage battery of the F04 also has its own control unit, which monitors these 
conditions and intervenes where necessary. This control unit is called the "battery management elec¬ 
tronics (SME)" and is located inside the high-voltage battery unit, which is why it is not accessible from 
the outside. 

The SME control unit must perform the following tasks: 

• Controlling cooling 

• Determining the state of charge (SoC) and the state of health (SoH) of the high-voltage battery 

• Determining the available power of the high-voltage battery and where necessary requesting a 
limitation from the electric motor electronics 

• Controlling the starting and shutting down of the high-voltage system at the request of the 
electric motor electronics 

• Safety functions (e.g. high-voltage interlock loop, insulation monitoring) 

• Monitoring the voltage and temperature of the battery cells and the current 

• Communicating fault states to the electric motor electronics. 

The SME control unit has its own fault memory which can be read out using the ISTA BMW diagnosis 
system. 

The electrical interfaces of the SME control unit are: 

• 12V supply voltage (terminal 30 from the battery safety terminal to supply the switch contac¬ 
tors and the SME control unit itself, terminal 31) 

• PT-CAN2 

• Wake-up line 

• Forward and return lines for high-voltage interlock loop 

• Line for activating the combined shut-off and expansion valve

6.1.5. High-voltage connection 

The connection of the high-voltage battery unit to the high-voltage electrical system is designed as a 
plug connection, but it is protected by a retaining bolt against being unintentionally released. The con¬ 
nector on the high-voltage battery unit contains contacts for: 

• Positive battery terminal and negative battery terminal 

• High voltage interlock loop 

The connector of the high-voltage cable features the contacts for the high-voltage positive lead and 
negative lead, as well as a bridge for the high-voltage interlock loop. The plug connection is designed 
in such a way that when the high-voltage cable is disconnected from the high-voltage battery, the 
bridge of the high-voltage interlock loop is pulled first. Only then are the high-voltage connections dis¬ 
connected from the power supply. When the high-voltage connector is released, the high-voltage sys¬ 
tem is automatically shut off by the opening of the electromechanical switch contactors. This process 
is an additional safety precaution to eliminate dangers posed by the high-voltage system to Service 
Personnel. Service Personnel must nevertheless still observe the electrical safety rules before carrying 
out any work on high-voltage components. 

A 

Before working on the high-voltage connection of the high-voltage battery unit or any other high volt¬ 
age component, it is essential to disconnect the high-voltage system from the power supply, to safe¬ 
guard the system against unintentional starting and to verify its safe isolation from the high voltage 
power supply.

The high-voltage safety connector is responsible for the following tasks: 

• Disconnecting the high-voltage system from the power supply 

• Providing a safeguard to prevent unintentional restarting 

The operating principle of the high-voltage safety connector in the F04 is based on the fact that the 
circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop is designed to be interrupted. The high-voltage system mon¬ 
itors this circuit permanently and powers down the high voltage automatically when an open circuit is 
detected. 


74 


























F04 Complete Vehicle 

6. High-voltage Battery Unit 

6.1.7. Overcurrent protection 

The F04 features several devices for protecting against overcurrent in the high-voltage circuit which 
are integrated in the high-voltage battery unit: 

• Measurement of the current with a precision resistor and shut-off of the high-voltage system 
when a threshold value is exceeded. 

— This is controlled through software by the battery management electronics (SME), which 
opens the contacts of the electromechanical switch contactors. 

• Measurement of the current and shut-off of the high-voltage system when a threshold value is 
exceeded. 

- This is triggered by the shut-off electronics and is specially intended for this purpose (a re¬ 
dundant hardware solution in contrast to the above-mentioned software solution). 

• A safety fuse, connected in series with the cells, interrupts the circuit automatically in the 
event of a short circuit. 

The current is determined with a precision resistor which is connected in series with the cells. The cur¬ 
rent is evaluated by the battery management electronics and by the shut-off electronics. If the battery 
management electronics detects an excessively high current, the shut-off of the current is first com¬ 
municated via bus signals to the electric motor electronics. In the optimum case, the current in the 
high-voltage circuit is thereby reduced to zero and only then are the contacts of the electromechanical 
switch contactors opened. In this way these contacts are subject to a very low load. 

Another type of shut-off is possible by way of special shut-off electronics - in this case, however, the 
contacts of the electromechanical switch contactors are opened directly. These electronic overcurrent 
protective devices are designed in such a way that they intervene before the safety fuse trips. 

The safety fuse has a nominal current of 150 A and will only trigger if the electronic protective mea¬ 
sures do not respond or do not respond quickly enough. When the safety fuse triggers, the high-volt¬ 
age system will no longer go into operation. Because it is integrated in the high-voltage battery unit, 
the fuse cannot be replaced separately. 

6.1.8. Cooling system 

To maximize the service life of the high-voltage battery and obtain the greatest possible power, it is op¬ 
erated in a defined temperature range. The high-voltage battery is essentially operational in the range 
of -13 °F to 131 °F (-25 °C to +55 °C). However, these temperature limits relate to the actual temper¬ 
ature of the cell, not the outside temperature. In terms of temperature behavior the high-voltage bat¬ 
tery is a slow-action system, thus it can take several hours for the cells to reach ambient temperature. 
Therefore having the battery spend a short period of time in an extremely hot or cold environment 
does not mean that the cells will have assumed this temperature. 

The high-voltage battery has been developed in such a way that it provides sufficient power to start 
the combustion engine within a large cell temperature range. Trials have demonstrated that starting 
the combustion engine is possible even at cell temperatures of -13 °F (-25 °C) and below. It is impor¬ 
tant to bear in mind that the cells assume the ambient temperature only when the vehicle has been ex¬ 
posed to this ambient temperature for several days. It is highly unlikely for the combustion engine of an 
F04 not to be able to be started due to low ambient temperatures. However, should this extreme case 
occur, the vehicle must be introduced into a warmer environment. 


75 



F04 Complete Vehicle 

6. High-voltage Battery Unit 

The upper temperature limit does not pose any restriction with regard to starting capability, since tem¬ 
peratures higher than 131 °F (55 °C) at the installation location of the high-voltage battery cannot be 
reached. This has been demonstrated by trials in "hot climates". In order to protect the battery against 
damage at such high cell temperatures, the high-voltage battery current (in and out) is limited by soft¬ 
ware. Cooling the high-voltage battery maintains the cell temperature at a lower level and increases 
the service life of the high-voltage battery. Therefore, the hybrid functions are available even when the 
electric drive is subject to intensive use and at high outside temperatures.

The high-voltage battery in the F04 is cooled by refrigerant. The air conditioning refrigerant circuit has 
therefore been extended in order to cool the high-voltage battery unit. The expansion valves for cli¬ 
mate control of the passenger compartment and for the high-voltage battery are connected in paral¬ 
lel. The battery management electronics can activate and open the combined shut-off and expansion 
valve for the high-voltage battery unit via a pulse-width modulated signal.

Due to the cooling of the high-voltage battery with refrigerant and the resulting large temperature dif¬ 
ferences, water vapor can condense inside the high-voltage battery. This condensation is discharged 
via a drain hose which is connected to the housing base. This drain hose and a gas vent pipe are 
brought together outside the high-voltage battery and led through a grommet out of the passenger 
compartment. The gas vent pipe serves to compensate large pressure differences between the interi¬ 
or and the exterior of the high-voltage battery. Pressure differences of this nature can only arise if a cell 
is damaged. In this case (as a safety measure) the housing of the damaged cell opens in order to re¬ 
duce the pressure. The escaping gases are then directed out of the vehicle through the gas vent pipe. 

The cooling strategy for the high voltage battery is explained below: 

When in the “Low-priority cooling” mode, the battery temperature (in range 1) is not that high, but 
cooling the battery there is also beneficial. When coming from a lower temperature, cooling will start 
at range (3). But once cooling has started, it will continue until the lower end of the range (left margin 
of “2”) is reached, this is referred to as the “Extended cooling range”. This works the same way for the 
“high-priority cooling” (range 4), once cooling has started, it will continue until the lower end of the 
range (left margin of “5”) is reached. The only difference is that cooling of the battery in this range is 
absolutely vital! The “Extended cooling range” is implemented in both cases order to reduce the num¬ 
ber of switch on - switch off cycles of the cooling function and thus extend the life of the related com¬ 
ponents.

12 

Hybrid functions are continuously reduced or switched off in order to

Note: In the “Extended cooling ranges” cooling continues beyond the typical cut off point in 
order to reduce the number of switch on - switch off cycles of the cooling function. This re¬ 
sults in longer but less frequent cooling cycles which extend the life of the related compo¬ 
nents. 

In the temperature range in which the high-voltage battery does not need to be cooled, the expansion 
valve for the high-voltage battery remains closed. 

When the temperature rises and "low-priority cooling" is required, the SME control unit sends a cool¬ 
ing demand for the high-voltage battery to the IHKA control unit via bus signals. The IHKA control unit 
reports back to the SME control unit whether cooling output is available for the high-voltage battery. If 
cooling output is available, the SME control unit opens the shut-off and expansion valve for the high- 
voltage battery. If no cooling output is available, the valve remains closed and no refrigerant is allowed 
to flow through the high voltage battery (priority remains with the cooling of the passenger compart¬ 
ment). 

If the temperature of the cells continues to rise, it is absolutely necessary to cool the high-voltage bat¬ 
tery. The SME control unit signals again the now urgent cooling demand "high-priority cooling" to the 
IHKA control unit. The shut-off and expansion valve for the high-voltage battery is opened in this case 
to protect the high-voltage battery against damage. If the electric A/C compressor was not switched 
on previously, it is now activated by the IHKA control unit in response to this request by the battery 
management electronics. This also occurs if the driver has switched off the air conditioning function 
for the passenger compartment. 

Although the cooling output is generally adequate, the situation may arise under extreme conditions 
where the temperature in the high-voltage battery continues to rise. In such an extreme case, the hy¬ 
brid functions are reduced in stages or no longer made available (e.g. the boost function). Here the fo¬ 
cus is on protecting the high-voltage components. If the temperature increases further, the system is 
protected by electronically limiting the high-voltage battery input and output current.

Note: Because the high-voltage battery is connected to the refrigerant circuit, preliminary work similar 
to that conducted on the air conditioning of conventional vehicles (e.g. evacuation and recycling of the 
refrigerant) will be required prior to removal and installation of some components. Always follow repair 
instructions. 


6.2. Functions 


6.2.1. Starting the high-voltage system 

Starting the high-voltage system occurs in the interaction between the electric motor electronics 
(EME) and battery management electronics (SME) control units. The EME control unit performs the 
role of the primary (master) and the SME control unit that of the secondary. The associated commands 
are transferred as bus signals via the PT-CAN2. 

The EME control unit requests starting of the high-voltage system when either terminal 15 is switched 
on or a request for independent air conditioning is present. The start takes place in multiple steps, 
each of which takes place only if the previous step has been completed successfully. 

1 Testing the high-voltage electrical system 

2 Raising the voltage 

3 Closing the contacts of the switch contactors. 

The first step, testing the high-voltage system, involves checking whether the high-voltage battery and 
the entire high-voltage electrical system are operational. This includes the requirement that the circuit 
of the high-voltage interlock loop be closed in order to start the high-voltage system. 

Even after the tests have been completed successfully, the contacts of the switch contactors still can¬ 
not be closed. Because of the capacities in the high-voltage circuit (link capacitors) a very high switch- 
on current would flow which would permanently damage both the link capacitors and the switch con¬ 
tactors. Therefore, the voltage is raised slowly beforehand. To do so, the negative lead of the switch 
contactor contact is initially closed. A constant current of about 2 A is set in the positive lead via an 
electronic circuit to charge the link capacitors. In this way the voltage in the high-voltage electrical sys¬ 
tem increases within a few hundred milliseconds to a value which is slightly below the voltage of the 
high-voltage battery. Then the positive lead of the switch contactor contact is closed. 

The SME control unit communicates successful starting via the PT-CAN2 to the EME control unit. In 
the same way, faults are signalled if the start was not successful. 

Note: Although the starting of the high-voltage system contains the above-mentioned steps, 
there is no noticeable delay when starting the car as far as the customer is concerned. An F04 
starts practically as quickly as an F01/F02.

6.2.2. Shutting off the high-voltage system 

When it comes to shutting off the high-voltage system a distinction is made between regular shut¬ 
off and fast shut-off. In the case of regular shut-off the emphasis is on protecting the electrical com¬ 
ponents and checking the high-voltage system. For example, the contacts of the electromechanical 
switch contactors are to be opened only when the current has dropped to a value close to 0 A, as they 
are otherwise subjected to heavy load. 

The conditions which trigger a regular shut-off are: 

• Deactivation of terminal 15 

• End of independent air conditioning and programming procedure of a high-voltage control unit 

• Interruption of the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop 

The basic sequence of regular shut-off is then (regardless of the triggering condition) the same: 

1 Regulating currents in the high-voltage electrical system down to zero (EME) 

2 Opening the switch contactors in the high-voltage battery unit (SME) 

3 Discharging the high-voltage circuit, i.e. active discharging of the link capacitors and short-circuit¬ 
ing of the windings in the electric motor (EME) 

4 Checking the high-voltage system, e.g. as to whether the contacts of the electromechanical 
switch contactors were correctly opened. 

The regular shut-off is interrupted if in the meantime starting is initiated again (e.g. because the driver 
switches on terminal 15 again). The regular shut-off is also interrupted if a situation arises that requires 
a fast shut-off of the high-voltage system. 

6.2.3. Fast shut-off of the high-voltage system 

The fast shut-off of the high-voltage system is carried out whenever, for safety reasons, the voltage in 
the high-voltage system must be reduced to a safe value as quickly as possible. 

The following list describes these situations and the signals with which fast shut-off of the high-volt¬ 
age system is triggered: 

• Accident: 

Crash Safety Module detects an impact of appropriate severity -> communication via bus sig¬ 
nals and disconnection of the battery safety terminal from the positive terminal of the 12V 
battery. 

• Short circuit monitoring: 

Current sensor in the high-voltage battery detects an excessively high current in the high-volt¬ 
age cables or the overcurrent cut-out in the high-voltage battery is activated. 

• Cell monitoring detects a critical state, e.g. undervoltage, overvoltage or excess temperature 

• Failure of the 12V voltage supply of the high-voltage battery unit -> SME control unit stops 
working 

In all these cases the contacts of the electromechanical switch contactors are opened and the high- 
voltage circuit is discharged immediately. This ensures the fastest possible shut-off, as is appropriate 
for these safety-relevant condition.

6.2.4. Charging and operational strategy 

The charging strategy for the high-voltage battery has two primary objectives, to maximize the ser¬ 
vice life of the high-voltage battery and to maintain reserves with regard to both energy consumption 
and energy draw. In order to achieve the first objective, the strategy involves not only the already men¬ 
tioned regulation of the cell temperature but also the regulation of the useful energy content. Instead 
of using the full state of charge range from zero to 100 %, only a range between approximately 30 and 
80 % is used. Depending on the cell temperature and the calculated state of health of the high-voltage 
battery, this useful range can be limited further. However, a sufficiently large useful energy content re¬ 
mains available over the full service life in order to implement the hybrid-specific functions and advan¬ 
tages. The state of charge of the high-voltage battery is indicated in the Central Information Display in 
the form of bars. The value displayed there of zero bars to five bars corresponds to the value used by 
the charging strategy of roughly 30 to 80 %. Therefore, there are still power reserves below the mini¬ 
mum displayed value and above the maximum displayed value.

During brake energy regeneration or load point increase of the combustion engine excess energy is 
converted by the electric motor into electrical energy. The high-voltage battery stores this electrical 
energy and makes it available again as required for the following purposes: 

• To supply the 14V electrical system while the combustion engine is switched off 

• To relieve and support the combustion engine (increase efficiency) 

• For the boost function (increase dynamics) 

• For independent air conditioning 

6.2.5. Monitoring functions 

There is a large number of monitoring functions in which the high-voltage battery unit and the battery 
management electronics play a substantial role. 

They include: 

• Monitoring functions to ensure the safety of the high-voltage system 

• Monitoring functions to ensure optimal operating conditions of the high-voltage battery 


82

For the safety-related monitoring functions, we will specifically discuss the role of the high-voltage 
battery unit in the high-voltage interlock loop and the insulation monitoring. 

The principle of the high-voltage interlock loop is described in detail in the "Principles of hybrid 
technology" training material available on TIS and ICR 

In the F04 the high-voltage interlock loop is made up of the high-voltage components in the graphic 
below.

Generator for interlock signal 


The electronics for controlling and generating the test signal for the high-voltage interlock loop is inte¬ 
grated in the battery management electronics. Generating the test signal starts when the high-voltage 
system is to be started and ends when the high-voltage system has been shut down. A square wave 
AC signal is generated as the test signal by the battery management electronics and supplied to the 
test lead. The test lead has a ring topology (similar to that of the MOST bus). The signal of the test lead 
is evaluated at two points in the ring: in the electric motor electronics and finally right at the end of the 
ring, in the battery management electronics. If the signal is outside a permanently defined range, an in¬ 
terruption of the circuit or a short circuit in the test lead is detected. As already described in the sec¬ 
tion "Fast shut-off of the high-voltage system", the high-voltage system is then shut off immediately. 

The insulation monitoring determines whether the insulation resistance between active high-voltage 
components (e.g. high-voltage cables) and ground is above or below a required minimum value. If the 
insulation resistance falls below the minimum value, the danger exists that the vehicle parts will be en¬ 
ergized with hazardous voltage. If a person were to touch a second active high-voltage component, he 
or she would be at risk of electric shock. There is therefore fully automatic insulation monitoring for the 
F04 high-voltage system. It is performed by the battery management electronics at regular intervals 
while the high-voltage system is active. Ground serves as the reference potential. Without additional 
measures only local insulation faults in the high-voltage battery unit could be determined in this way. 
However, it is equally important to identify insulation faults from the high-voltage cables in the vehicle 
to ground. For this reason, all the electrically conductive housings of high-voltage components are di¬ 
rectly connected to ground. This enables insulation faults in the entire high-voltage electrical system 
to be identified, from a central point (the high-voltage battery). 

A 

The proper electrical connection of all high-voltage component housings to ground is an important 
prerequisite for proper function of the insulation monitoring function. Therefore, this electrical connec¬ 
tion must be restored carefully if it has been interrupted during repair work. 


The insulation monitoring responds in two stages. When the insulation resistance drops below a first 
threshold value, there is still no direct danger to people. The high-voltage system therefore remains 
active; no Check Control message is displayed, but the fault status is naturally stored in the fault mem¬ 
ory. In this way the Service technician is alerted the next time the car is in the workshop and can then 


85 











F04 Complete Vehicle 

6. High-voltage Battery Unit 

check the high-voltage system. When the insulation resistance drops below a second, lower threshold 
value, this is accompanied not only by the storage of the fault in the fault memory, but also by the dis¬ 
play of a Check Control message prompting the driver to visit a BMW Service Center. 

However, the service technician does not have to perform a fundamental measurement of the insula¬ 
tion resistance him-/herself - this task is performed by the high-voltage system through the insulation 
monitoring. When an insulation fault is detected, the service technician must run through a test plan in 
the ISTA diagnosis system to find the actual location of the insulation fault. 


6.3. Service Instructions 

6.3.1. Installation and removal 

The high-voltage battery unit can only be replaced as a complete unit and only when indicated by the 
test plan on ISTA BMW diagnostic system. 

A 

Note: Because the high-voltage battery unit is a high-voltage component, it is essential dur¬ 
ing removal and installation to observe the electrical safety rules before starting work. 


In the event that the refrigerant lines have to be removed or any service is being done on the cooling 
system of the high voltage battery that requires the opening of the circuit, the refrigerant must be recy¬ 
cled following approved BMW procedures prior to removal and after installation re-introduced. 

A_ 

A precise description of the work sequence for removal and installation of all the hybrid components 
can be found in the repair instructions. Always follow the proper repair instructions when working on 
BMW vehicles. 


Note: The special tool has been developed to help in lifting the high-voltage battery unit out 
of and back into the vehicle, this tool must be used whenever service is required (A part no. 
was not yet available at the time of this material.) 

6.3.2. Charging and starting aid 

This section discusses the charging process and the starting aid when the high-voltage battery is dis¬ 
charged. If the 12V battery of an F04 is flat, it can be charged as in conventional vehicles. 

The operational strategy controls the state of charge of the high-voltage battery such that the vehi¬ 
cle can be restarted, even after a long immobilization (storage) period. If, despite this, the high-voltage 
battery is discharged deeply enough that it can no longer be started, a corresponding Check Control 
message is displayed. 

In this case, the high-voltage battery can be charged via the 14 V electrical system. However, when 
you connect an approved battery charger to the positive battery connection point and to ground, 
initially only the 14V vehicle electrical system will be supplied with power and the 12V battery is 
charged. 


86 






F04 Complete Vehicle 

6. High-voltage Battery Unit 

The following prerequisites must be satisfied before the high-voltage battery can be charged: 

• High-voltage battery discharged to the extent that engine starting is no longer possible 

• Two unsuccessful attempts to start the engine or Service function "Charge high-voltage bat¬ 
tery" started 

• Terminal 15 switched on 

• Charger with a minimum voltage of 13.5 V connected. We recommend that you use a charger 
with a maximum current of 70 A (or higher) so that not only the 14V electrical system is sup¬ 
plied, but also a significant current is still available to charge the high-voltage battery 

The DC/DC converter in the electric motor electronics now functions as an up converter. Electrical en¬ 
ergy then flows from the 14V vehicle electrical system to the high-voltage electrical system and the 
high-voltage battery is charged. 

A 

During this process, all electrical consumers in the vehicle that are not needed must be switched off. 
The charging process can take several minutes, depending on the battery charger used. The process 
of charging the high-voltage battery should only be ended when a Check Control message issues a 
prompt to that effect.

HYBRID 


Check Control symbol for high-voltage battery 

The same Check Control symbol is used for all Check Control messages displayed in the instrument 
cluster regarding the state of charge of the high-voltage battery. The Check Control messages are ex¬ 
plained by the notes displayed in the central information display. 

If start assistance (emergency jump) has to be given to an F04 with a flat high-voltage battery, pro¬ 
ceed as previously described to charge the high-voltage battery with a battery charger. It must be not¬ 
ed here that after the energy-dispensing vehicle has been connected to the F04 the "Ready to drive" 
status cannot be established immediately. Instead you must wait until the Check Control message in 
the F04 indicates that the high-voltage battery is sufficiently charged. Only then may they energy-dis¬ 
pensing vehicle be disconnected from the F04. 

6.3.3. Safe working practices for working on a high-voltage system 

A 

Before working on high-voltage components of the F04, it is essential to observe and implement the 
electrical safety rules: 

1 The high-voltage system must be disconnected from the power supply 

2 The high-voltage system must be provided with a safeguard to prevent unintentional restarting 

3 The safe isolation of the high-voltage system must be verified 


87 







F04 Complete Vehicle 

6. High-voltage Battery Unit 

The following chapters provide brief descriptions on how to implement the electrical safety rules in the 
F04. 

Preparations 

Prior to beginning any work the following steps must be taken: 

1 The vehicle must be secured against rolling (engage the parking lock of the automatic transmis¬ 
sion and activate the parking brake). 

2 Terminal 15 and terminal R must be switched off. 

3 If a charger is connected, it must be switched off and disconnected. 

Disconnecting the high-voltage system from the supply 

The high-voltage system in the F04 is disconnected from the power supply with the high-voltage safe¬ 
ty connector. To disconnect from the power supply, the high-voltage safety connector must be pulled 
from its socket. This interrupts the circuit of the high-voltage interlock loop.

Safeguarding the high-voltage system against unintentional restarting 

The safeguarding of the high-voltage system against unintentional restarting is performed on the 
socket side of the high-voltage safety connector. A commercially available padlock (for example, 
ABUS 45/40) is required for this purpose.

The high-voltage safety connector cannot be connected when the padlock is inserted in the socket 
and locked. This is an effective way of ensuring that the high-voltage system is not switched on again 
without the knowledge and consent of the service technician working on the vehicle. 

Verifying safe isolation from the supply 

The de-energized state is not verified using a measuring device or via the ISTA diagnostic system. In¬ 
stead, the high-voltage components measure the voltage themselves and transmit the measuring re¬ 
sult via bus signal to the instrument cluster. The instrument cluster does not generate the Check Con¬ 
trol message to display the de-energized state unless all involved high-voltage components consis¬ 
tently signal the de-energized state.

In order to verify the de-energized state, you must switch on terminal 15 and wait until you see the 
Check Control message with the symbol shown above on the instrument cluster. Then, and only then, 
you have ensured that the high-voltage system is de-energized. After the de-energized state has been 
verified, terminal 15 and terminal R must be switched off again before you can start the actual work on 
the vehicle. 

A_ 

If the Check Control message is not displayed, you must not carry out any work on high-volt¬ 
age components! 

You must STOP work and enter a PUMA case for instructions as to how to proceed with the 
repair. 


6.3.4. Procedure after an accident 

The safety concept of the high-voltage system ensures that, even during or after an accident, there is 
no danger to the customer or the Service personal. The high-voltage system is automatically deacti¬ 
vated in the event of an accident in such a way that no dangerous voltages are applied at those points 
on the high-voltage components which are accessible from the outside. 

Deactivation of the high-voltage system is carried as follows: 

In normal operation the battery management electronics is supplied via terminal 30F. The coils of the 
electromechanical switch contactors are also supplied. Deactivation in the event of an accident is done 
by an extended battery safety terminal. It contains an additional normally closed contact. This switch 
contact opens when the battery safety terminal is triggered at the same time as the positive battery 


90 









F04 Complete Vehicle 

6. High-voltage Battery Unit 

cable is severed. This interrupts the voltage supply to the battery management electronics and to 
the switch contactors. The contacts of the switch contactors open so that dangerous voltage can no 
longer be fed by the high-voltage battery into the high-voltage electrical system. A lead to the electric 
motor electronics is also branched from the supply lead of the battery management electronics. The 
electric motor electronics evaluates this lead. In the event of an accident the voltage on this lead drops 
to 0 V, and the electric motor electronics discharges the link capacitors and closes the windings on the 
electric motor briefly. 

After an accident the safety battery terminal remains in the above-described state such that the bat¬ 
tery management electronics is not operational. Thus the high-voltage system remains inactive even if 
terminal 15 is switched on again. 

This is useful for safety reasons, but has two effects, which the Service Technician must be aware of: 

1 The instrument cluster will not display the isolation from the power supply, because the corre¬ 
sponding bus signal from the battery management electronics fails to appear. The Service Tech¬ 
nician therefore must not work on the high-voltage components. 

2 The diagnosis system cannot address the battery management electronics and read out the fault 
memory. Thus diagnosis of the high-voltage battery unit is not possible either. 

Note: If the F04 battery safety terminal has triggered in the event of an accident a special han¬ 
dling procedure is needed. Refer to the repair instructions available in ISTA for more informa¬ 
tion. 

A 

Before working on the high-voltage components or on the battery safety terminal of an F04 
which has been involved in an accident with a triggered battery safety terminal, contact the 
Technical Support (PUMA) of the BMW Group.

7.1. Installation location and connections 

The power electronics of the F04 serves as the control electronics for the permanent-field electrical 
synchronous machine in the powertrain. A bidirectional inverter is used for converting the DC volt¬ 
age (120 V DC) from the high-voltage battery into a three-phase AC voltage (120 V AC) to activate 
the three-phase machine and vice versa in generator mode. A DC/DC converter ensures the voltage 
supply to the 14V electrical system. The entire power electronics of the F04 is located within the alu¬ 
minum housing of the electric motor electronics (EME). This housing contains the control unit, the DC/ 
DC converter and the (DC/AC, AC/DC) bidirectional inverter. The EME can only be replaced as a com¬ 
plete unit, as its components are not available separately. 

Note: The system supplier of the EME for the F04 is the company Continental AG. It was de¬ 
veloped in a cooperation between BMW AG and Daimler AG.

Only high voltage certified Service Technicians are permitted to work on high-voltage compo¬ 
nents. Always comply with the safety rules and procedures and follow the repair instructions 
to the letter. 


Because the EME is installed in the lower area of the vehicle, a vent line is required to prevent water 
(resulting from temperature changes and possible condensation of air moisture) from collecting inside 
the EME. The vent line is situated at the highest possible location, on top of the EME housing. 

The insulation monitoring determines whether the insulation resistance between active high-voltage 
components (e.g. high-voltage cables) and ground is above or below a required minimum value. If the 
insulation resistance falls below the minimum value, there is a risk that the vehicle parts will be ener¬ 
gized with hazardous voltage. If a person were to touch a second active high-voltage component, he or 
she would be in danger of electric shock. 

There is therefore fully automatic insulation monitoring for the F04 high-voltage system. It is per¬ 
formed by the battery management electronics (SME) at regular intervals while the high-voltage sys¬ 
tem is active. Ground serves as the reference potential. Without additional measures only local insula¬ 
tion faults in the high-voltage battery unit could be determined in this way. However, it is equally impor¬ 
tant to identify insulation faults from the high-voltage cables in the vehicle to ground. For this reason, 
all the electrically conductive housings of high-voltage components are connected to ground. In this 
way insulation faults in the entire high-voltage electrical system can be identified from a central point 
by the insulation monitoring. 

A 

The proper electrical connection of all high-voltage component housings to ground is an important 
prerequisite for proper function of the insulation monitoring. Accordingly, this electrical connection 
must be restored carefully if it has been interrupted during repair work to the vehicle. 

The points of contact must be kept clean, e.g. free from oil and grease!

AC/DC bi-directional inverter 


7.3. Functions 

The EME internally comprises three logic units: The bidirectional inverter, the DC/DC converter for 
supplying the 14V electrical system, and the control electronics with the hybrid master functionality. 
The inverter and the DC/DC converter are both activated by the control electronics. 

The EME performs the following functions: 

• Supply of the 14V electrical system via the DC/DC converter 

• Charging of the high-voltage battery from the 14V electrical system for external starting 

• Support of the high-voltage battery during cold starting 

• Regulation of the electric motor (rotational speed, torque or voltage) 

• Connecting to the electric motor via busbars 

• Cooling of the EME 

• High-voltage connection for the electric A/C compressor 

• Connection of the high-voltage battery 

• Communication with other control units 

• Active and passive discharging of the link capacitor to voltages less then 60 V 

• Reverse polarity protection 

• Active evaluation of a signal for the high-voltage interlock loop (interlock) 

• Self-test and diagnostic function 

7.3.1. DC/DC converter 

The DC/DC converter transfers electrical power from the high-voltage electrical system to the 14V 
electrical system and vice versa. There are two operating modes, depending on the direction in which 
the DC/DC converter converts the voltage: 

• Down conversion 

• Up conversion

Voltage level with 14V 


Down conversion 

Down conversion (also known as buck mode) refers to the voltage conversion from the high-voltage 
level to the 14V level. In this operating mode the DC/DC converter has a maximum power output of 2.1 
kW or 150 A. 

The nominal voltage can be specified by the EME in a range from 11.0 V to 15.5 V. The DC/DC con¬ 
verter is operated with a set-point input of 14 V. This operating mode is selected whenever the vehicle 
is being driven. The 14V electrical system is supplied in vehicle mode via the DC/DC converter with 
electrical energy. Thus it replaces the alternator previously used for this purpose. 


97 































F04 Complete Vehicle 

7. Power Electronics 


Up conversion 

Up conversion (also known as boost mode) refers to the voltage conversion from the 14V level to the 
high-voltage level. In this operating mode the DC/DC converter can transfer a power output of 0.5 kW 
and is capable of charging a heavily discharged high-voltage battery. 

The charging process is automatically started by the EME under the following conditions: 

• If the voltage of the high-voltage battery has dropped below a predetermined threshold value 

• If a charger has been detected (vehicle voltage greater than 13.5 V in the 14V electrical sys¬ 
tem) 

• If two engine starts have failed consecutively 

• Terminal 15 must be switched on 

If the voltage of the high-voltage battery is too low and an engine start has failed, the following Check 
Control message is displayed: "Vehicle not ready to drive". 

If a second engine start has failed, the following Check Control message is displayed: "Switch on igni¬ 
tion to charge". 

Alternatively the charging process can be started with the following Service function: "Charge high- 
voltage battery". 

While the voltage is being converted from the 14 V electrical system to the high-voltage electrical sys¬ 
tem (high-voltage battery is being charged), the following Check Control message is displayed: "High- 
voltage battery charging". 

The process is cancelled in the following situations: 

• The charge current of the high-voltage battery has dropped below the threshold value of 1 A 

• The charger has been disconnected from the 14V electrical system 

• A fault has occurred or the ignition has been switched off. Then the following Check Control 
message is displayed: "Charging finished". 

A 

To supply the 14V electrical system and at the same time charge the high-voltage battery, use a suf¬ 
ficiently powerful charger (maximum charge current of at least 70 A). Switch off unnecessary power 
consumers in the vehicle (e.g. exterior lights or air conditioning). 

Note: The BMW recommended Multicharger 1500,100A battery charger (PN 81 39 2 161 
589), is available for use with ActiveHybrid vehicles.

1 Disconnect the high-voltage system from 
the supply 

2 Safeguard the high-voltage system 
against unintentional restarting

7.3.3. Connection for high-voltage battery 

The connection for the high-voltage battery is located in the lower area of the EME and is designed as 
a plug connection. 

The connector for the high-voltage battery contains contacts for: 


100 

























F04 Complete Vehicle 

7. Power Electronics 


Positive battery terminal 
Negative battery terminal 
High voltage interlock loop 



The plug connection is designed in such a way 
that before the high-voltage cable is discon¬ 
nected, the bridge (1) of the high-voltage inter¬ 
lock loop must be unlocked and pulled. 



Then the slide (1) is pulled downwards into 
the first locking position. Here the plug (3) for 
the high-voltage interlock loop is partially con¬ 
cealed by the plastic cover (2). The connector 
of the high-voltage cable (4) can now be pulled 
out to the first locking position. The slide (1) can 
now be pulled into the second locking position 
and the connector of the high-voltage cable (4) 
pulled off entirely. Here the plug (3) of the high- 
voltage interlock loop is fully concealed by the 
plastic cover (2). 


7.3.4. EME low-voltage connector 

All the signal lines are connected via a 28-pin EME low-voltage connector to the wiring harness. 

Voltage supply 

Voltage is supplied to the electronics (12 V) in the EME via terminal 30B. The connection of terminal 
31 in the signal connector is not designed as a supply pin. The actual reference potential of the power 
electronics is provided on series via the housing. The EME housing is secured with four bolts to the oil 
sump, thereby creating the ground connection. 


101 











F04 Complete Vehicle 

7. Power Electronics 


CAN connections 

The EME communicates with other control units via the PT-CAN/PT-CAN2 and with the DME via the 
H-CAN. The EME contains two terminal resistors connected in series for the H-CAN. Each resistor has 
a value of 60 ohms (60 ohms + 60 ohms =120 ohms). The PT-CAN connections of the EME have no 
terminal resistors. 

Temperature sensor 

The windings of the electric motor must not exceed a temperature of 392 °F (200 °C) during operation. 
The temperature is measured in one of the windings with the aid of a temperature sensor. A thermis¬ 
tor with negative temperature coefficient (NTC) is used for this purpose. The electric motor electronics 
uses voltage and current measurements to determine the resistance and calculates the temperature 
from these measurements. If the windings approach the maximum allowable temperature (356 °F), the 
power output of the electric motor is reduced. This function is controlled by the electric motor elec¬ 
tronics. 

Rotor position sensor 

The rotor position sensor senses the exact position of the electric motor's rotor. This is necessary for 
precise regulation of the electric motor, because the voltages must be generated at the stator windings 
to match the position of the rotor. The rotor position sensor outputs an analogsignal, which is read and 
processed by the electric motor electronics. 

High voltage interlock loop (interlock) 

The electronics for controlling and generating the test signal (88 Hz square wave signal) for the high- 
voltage interlock loop is integrated in the F04 in the battery management electronics. The signal of the 
test lead is evaluated at two points in the ring: in the electric motor electronics (EME) and finally (right 
at the end of the ring) in the battery management electronics (SME). The high-voltage system is shut 
off immediately, if the signal is outside a permanently defined range, an interruption of the circuit or a 
short circuit in the test lead is detected. 

When the high-voltage system is shut off, the link capacitors must be discharged in a specified time to 
a determined voltage. In the case of active discharging the voltage at the link capacitors drops below 
60 V within 5 seconds. In the case of a passive discharge circuit the voltage drops below 60 V DC after 
120 seconds. 

Crash signal 

If the Crash Safety Module detects an impact of appropriate severity -»this is communicated via the 
Bus line and to the battery safety terminal via a hardwire line, to disconnect the positive terminal of the 
12V battery -> the SME and the EME are also signaled via a hardwire line.

The semiconductors of the power electronics must be protected against excess temperature. There¬ 
fore, the EME unit is cooled by the cooling circuit. The EME circuit is not directly connected to the 
coolant-to-air heat exchanger. Instead the expansion tank serves here as a mixer, i.e. the coolant from 
the EME cooling circuit dissipates thermal energy to the coolant in the expansion tank. Cooling of the 
EME can thus be controlled independently of the charge air cooling circuit. Thus the cooling of the 
charge air and the Digital Engine Electronics is not affected by this. The coolant is first cooled in the 
coolant-to-air heat (low temperature system) exchanger before flowing to the charge air coolers (inter¬ 
coolers) and the Digital Engine Electronics. Standard coolant (50% water and 50% glycol) is used as 


103

the cooling medium. This circuit includes an electric coolant pump (50 W) which is speed-controlled 
(with a pulse-width modulated signal) and diagnosed by the EME . The flow rate is dependent on the 
power and amounts on average to 6.3 quarts (6 liters) per minute. 

7.3.6. Reverse polarity protection 

Reverse polarity protection serves to avoid consequential damage to the vehicle electrical system and 
electronic components connected to it in the event of the polarity being reversed by the customer dur¬ 
ing an emergency jump start. The diodes in the alternator are generally used to for this purpose but 
because the conventional alternator is not used in the F04 (electric motor in the transmission), this is 
done by the DC/DC converter in the EME. In other words, the F04 does not have a separate reverse 
polarity protection module as in E72. 


7.4. Service Instructions 

The most important service instructions for handling the EME are explained in the following chapter. 

A 

Only high voltage Certified Service Technicians are permitted to work on hybrid high-voltage compo¬ 
nents. Always comply with the safety rules and procedures and follow proper repair instructions. 


A _ 

Make sure that the EME housing and ground cable have a good ground connection. Use the correct 
screws/bolts and observe the correct tightening torque and sequence. 

The points of contact must be kept clean (free from oil and grease). The assembly sequence and the 
repair concept must be observed. Assembly and disassembly of the high-voltage plug connection 
must be observed. 

Insulation monitoring can function only if all electrically conductive housings of the high-voltage com¬ 
ponents are galvanically (electrically) connected to ground, in other words to the body of the vehicle. 
This galvanic connection has to be present in order, for example, for the monitor implemented in the 
power electronics to reliably detect a short circuit in a high-voltage cable to the housing. In the ab¬ 
sence of this galvanic connection between housing and ground the fault would remain undetected and 
would therefore constitute a potential hazard. 


A _ 

Note: The EME itself does not require maintenance. However the fluid level of the coolant circuit does 
have to be checked as regular maintenance. 


A 

For reasons of high-voltage safety the EME must not be opened or otherwise dismantled. It is not per¬ 
mitted to remove the mounting cover and release the contacts of the three busbars (U, V, W). 

In the event of a failure of the component, always replace the EME as a complete unit. 


104 









F04 Complete Vehicle 

7. Power Electronics 


The EME must also be replaced if damaged (e.g. break in the housing, damage to the connector). 
The EME is diagnosed and programmed as the rest of the control units in the vehicle.

The hybrid-specific operating modes are displayed in the instrument cluster and if desired, in the Cen¬

The following hybrid-specific operating modes are displayed in the instrument cluster: 

• "Ready to drive" display 

• Boost function display 

• Energy recovery display 

They are permanently displayed in the lower part of the tachometer (in the info display). Both the dis¬ 
play in the CID and in the instrument cluster are activated when terminal 15 is switched on. 

The energy/power flows and the state of charge of the high-voltage battery can be shown in the CID in 
all the vehicle's operating modes. This provides the driver with a “real time” overview of the operation 
of the hybrid system in the different driving states. The hybrid-specific displays are called up in the CID 
via the "Vehicle Info > Hybrid" menu.

The "Ready to drive" status is signalled to the driver when the tachometer needle points to zero and at 
the same time in the lower part the blue arc flashes with "READY". Here the vehicle is stationary and 
the combustion engine is not running. When the driver's foot comes off the brake pedal, the accelera¬ 
tor pedal is depressed or the steering wheel is moved, the combustion engine will start and the vehicle 
can start moving. 

The combustion engine is switched off when the vehicle is in the "Ready to drive" status. The 
tachometer needle points to 0 rpm. In the CID the current state of charge of the high-voltage battery is 
indicated by the blue color of the five segments. When the driver's foot comes off the brake pedal, the 
combustion engine is started quickly and with minimal vibration. When the Automatic Hold function is 
activated the combustion engine is started only when the accelerator pedal is pressed. Another way of 
starting the combustion engine from stopped is to turn the steering wheel to the left or right. The com¬ 
bustion engine is started to give the driver adequate steering support.

When the vehicle is driving at a constant speed there are no changes in the instrument cluster when 
compared with the F01/F02. Only the battery symbol and the wording "ActiveHybrid" are displayed. 

The display of the energy/power flows in the CID functions according to the following principle: 


107 


















F04 Complete Vehicle 

8. Displays and Controls 

• Blue: Electrical energy 

• Red: Energy of the combustion engine 

• Arrow: Direction of the energy/power flow 

A combustion engine can operate at maximum efficiency when the vehicle is being driven at a steady, 
relatively high speed. Consequently, the combustion engine is the primary source of propulsion for 
driving under these conditions. This is indicated in the CID by the red drive arrow. 

If the high-voltage battery is in a low state of charge, part of the power developed by the combustion 
engine is used to recharge the battery through the electric motor. This is indicated to the customer by 
an active automatic transmission (blue) and the blue arrows flowing in the direction of the battery sym¬ 
bol. 

When the high-voltage battery has a sufficient state of charge the electrical energy can be drawn from 
the high-voltage battery for the electric motor to support the vehicle's drive. The combustion engine 
can thereby be operated at low (favorable) revs. In this case the arrows flow from the battery symbol to 
the symbol for automatic transmission.

Text message for current driving situation "eBOOST" 


In the case of powerful acceleration (boost function) both the power of the combustion engine and the 
power of the electric motor are called up simultaneously to drive the vehicle. In the instrument cluster, 
an arrow appears to the left of the battery symbol as well as the word "BOOST" to indicate the electri¬ 
cal energy output. The tachometer needle indicates the current revs of the combustion engine and the 
red display indicates its fuel economy. 


108

In the CID the boost function is represented by a red arrow (combustion engine contribution) and a 
slightly smaller blue arrow (electric motor contribution). The combustion engine is shown in red here. 
The activity of the electric motor in the automatic transmission is indicated by the blue color of the 
transmission. 

The five segments symbolize the state of charge of the high-voltage battery. Each segment equals 
20% of the state of charge. The last segment (which displays the current state of charge of the HV 
battery) is shown in different shades of blue. This enables the intermediate stages in the range of 0% 
to 20% to be visualized. In the example above four segments are filled, this equates to a usable state 
of charge of 80%. The power flow is depicted with two colors to show that the power flow to the rear 
wheels comes from both drive sources. Red indicates the contribution by the combustion engine and 
blue the contribution by the electric motor.

Arrow for brake energy regeneration 


The display for brake energy regeneration in the instrument cluster takes the form of a blue arrow 
pointing in the direction of the battery symbol. The blue arrow varies in length, depending on the 
deceleration or on the intensity of the brake pedal actuation. Because the combustion engine is no 
longer delivering drive torque, the red drive arrow disappears from the display. 

The transmission is shown in blue because the electric motor is now functioning as a generator and 
generating a braking torque. Here electrical energy flows into the high-voltage battery. This is indicat¬ 
ed by two thin blue lines and the large blue arrow pointing to the high-voltage battery. The power flow 
from the rear wheels to the output shaft is depicted by animated blue arrows.

Explanation 

1 

Display for boost function (European version) 

2 

Display for boost function (US version) 


The hybrid-specific displays for the boost function are inverted in the European compared to the US 
versions. The reason for this is that in Europe the fuel consumption is given in the consumption indica¬ 
tor in liters per 100 kilometers, while in the US the fuel economy it is given in miles per gallon. In other 
words, the fuel consumption indicator in European cars indicates how much fuel (in liters) is consumed 
over a predefined distance travelled (100 km). In US vehicles the situation is reversed in that the indi¬ 
cator shows how far (in miles) one can drive on a predefined amount of fuel (gallons). 

Brake energy regeneration generates energy which can be used later to start the combustion engine 
or for the boost function. This function enhances fuel efficiency and in order to indicate this to the driv¬ 
er, the hybrid-specific display (in US vehicles) are located to the right of the fuel economy indicator (in 
the direction of more miles), in order to indicate to the driver that he/she can drive a greater distance 
thanks to the regenerated energy. In European vehicles, the hybrid-specific displays are located direct¬ 
ly to the left of the fuel consumption indicator, i.e. in the direction of the smaller display for current (in¬ 
stantaneous) fuel consumption.

An electrically driven A/C compressor is used in the F04 as in the E72. Because the A/C compressor 
has an electric motor, it is possible to operate the air conditioning independently of the combustion en¬ 
gine. Thus the customer can enjoy the cooling effect of the air conditioning even while driving in elec¬ 
tric mode (E72) and while the vehicle is stopped. Due to special silencing of the compressor, the air 
conditioning can barely be heard even when the vehicle is stationary and the combustion engine is off. 

The independent (parked-car) air conditioning function is offered for the first time in a BMW produc¬ 
tion vehicle. When the vehicle is parked, for example in the blazing sun, the interior temperature can be 
reduced by virtually half in about two minutes. The customer can activate the independent air condi¬ 
tioning via the remote control button. The car cools down noticeably while the customer, for example, 
loads his/her shopping. When the vehicle is started the full cooling output is then available immediately 
without the (otherwise typical) initial burst of hot air coming out of the air vents.

High-voltage component warning sticker 


Each high-voltage component is clearly tabled, on its housing or casing, to enable Service Personnel 
and vehicle users to identify the possible hazards associated with high voltages and the precautions 
that must be taken when handling them. 

A 

Only high voltage Certified Service Technicians are permitted to work on hybrid high-voltage 
components. Always comply with the safety rules and procedures and follow proper the repair 
instructions. 


Before working on a high-voltage component, you must apply the safety rules to shut down the high- 
voltage system. Once this has been accomplished according to procedure and all high-voltage com¬ 
ponents are no longer live, work can proceed in safety. There is, of course, a remote possibility that 
the correct shutdown procedure might be omitted, so an extra safety precaution is implemented as a 
means of imposing an automatic shutdown of the high-voltage system. Bridges of the high-voltage in¬ 
terlock loop (HVIL) are located both in the signal connector and in the high-voltage connector of the 
compressor. 

The electric A/C compressor in the F04 is installed in the same location as the belt-driven A/C com¬ 
pressor in the F01/F02. Because the electric A/C compressor in the F04 is not driven via the ribbed V- 
belt, it could theoretically have been installed anywhere in the vehicle, but for reasons of space and to 
utilize the existing connections to the condenser the installation location has not been changed.

Electric A/C compressor 


The electric A/C compressor is operated by the electrical energy from the high-voltage battery. The 
high-voltage cables from the high-voltage battery run first to the EME. The connection of the high- 
voltage cable for the electric A/C compressor is located on the EME. The high-voltage fuse serves to 
protect the high-voltage cable between the EME and the electric A/C compressor; this fuse can be re¬ 
placed in a Service. 

Electric A/C compressor control unit and DC/AC inverter 

The electric A/C compressor control unit controls the rotational speed of the three-phase motor in the 
A/C compressor as a function of the requests of the IHKA. The electric A/C compressor communi¬ 
cates with the IHKA via the LIN bus. The IHKA is the master control unit for the electric A/C compres¬ 
sor. The DC/AC inverter converts the direct current voltage into the alternating current that is required 
to operate the three-phase motor. The electric A/C compressor control unit and the DC/AC inverter 
are integrated in the aluminum housing of the A/C compressor and are cooled by the gaseous refriger¬ 
ant flowing past. If the temperature of the DC/AC inverter exceeds 230 °F (110 °C), it is shut off by the 
electric A/C compressor control unit. Attempts are made through different measures such as e.g. in¬ 
creasing the speed of the compressor, which keep the temperature from rising so high. The tempera¬ 
ture is monitored by the electric A/C compressor control unit.

Three-phase motor 

A three-phase AC synchronous motor is used as the drive for the A/C compressor. It is an outer rotor 
design and the magnetic field of the rotor is generated by ten permanent magnets. The synchronous 
motor is infinitely variable and operated in the speed range between 2000 and 8600 rpm. The nominal 
power capacity is 4.5 kW at 6500 rpm.

Outer disc with spiral profile 


The inner disc with spiral profile is driven via a shaft by the synchronous motor and rotates eccentrical¬ 
ly. The gaseous refrigerant at low temperature and low pressure is drawn in through two openings in 
the fixed outer spiral profile disc. There it is compressed and heated by the movement of the two spiral 
discs.

The principle of refrigerant compression 

After three revolutions, the refrigerant drawn in is compressed, heated and exits in a gaseous state 
through an opening in the center of the outer disc. From here, the gaseous refrigerant with high tem¬ 
perature and high pressure is sent via an oil separator (at the connection of the A/C compressor) to the 
condenser. The maximum operating pressure is 30 bar. 

Since the combustion engine on a hybrid vehicle does not run when the vehicle is stopped and thus 
cannot drown the noise generated by the auxiliary component, these are designed to operate as quiet 
as possible. For this reason, the sound of electric A/C compressor is muffled with the use of a special 
silencer installed between the connection of the A/C compressor and the condenser.

The refrigerant circuit of the F04 is essentially the same as that used in conventional vehicles. R134a 
is used as the refrigerant, which circulates in a circuit, absorbing heat at one point in the system and 
releasing it at another point. The heat absorbed from the passenger compartment and high-voltage 
battery is released to the ambient air in a heat exchanger (condenser) on the front of the vehicle. When 
the air conditioning is activated for the passenger compartment or when cooling output is requested 
for the high-voltage battery, the electrically driven A/C compressor is switched on and the system sup¬ 
plies the corresponding area with refrigerant. The passenger compartment cooling and the cooling of 
the high-voltage battery can be operated independently of each other. The energy required for this is 
drawn by the electric A/C compressor from the high-voltage battery. The BMW-approved PAG oil is 
used as the lubricant for the refrigerant circuit. 

So that the battery cooling and the passenger compartment cooling can be operated independently of 
each other, special solenoid valves are integrated into the refrigerant circuit. These open only the por¬ 
tion of the circuit that is actually required. This ensures high efficiency and proper control characteris¬ 
tics of the system. The following table shows how the valves and the electric A/C compressor are con¬ 
trolled.

Switched off 


If the customer switches off the A/C compressor, for example, the LED for switching the A/C com¬ 
pressor goes out, even though the electric A/C compressor may in some cases still be switched on for 
cooling the high-voltage battery. 

Depending on the SoC value of the high-voltage battery, when "ready to drive" is activated (terminal 
15 is switched on), the electric A/C compressor and thus the passenger compartment cooling can be 
requested (star LED is illuminated). 


9.3. New features 


9.3.1. Independent air conditioning 

Due to the high energy and power density of the high-voltage battery and the use of an electric AC 
compressor in the F04, it was possible to implement the independent air conditioning function for 
the first time in a BMW production vehicle.

Button for activating independent air conditioning 


Here the hot passenger compartment can be cooled immediately prior to the start of driving for about 
two minutes. The function can be conveniently activated by pressing the fourth button on the vehicle's 
infrared remote control at outside temperatures > 59 °F (15 °C). If the customer opens a car door 
shortly before these two minutes have elapsed, the cooling period is extended by about 30 seconds. 
Independent air conditioning can be activated again only after engine operation. The prerequisite for 
activating independent air conditioning is a sufficient state of charge of the high-voltage battery (SoC 
> 42 %). The customer is alerted by a Check Control message if the state of charge of the high-voltage 
battery is not sufficient. 

Independent ventilation can also be activated with the remote control above an outside temperature of 
59 °F (15 °C). In this case independent ventilation is activated automatically for a maximum period of 
30 minutes after the end of the independent air conditioning function. Both functions, independent air 
conditioning and independent ventilation are ended when terminal 15 is activated. 

The reception-dependent average range of the remote control is about 49 ft/15 m.

The residual cooling function is an additional climate control function which has been made possible 
by the use of the electrically operated A/C compressor. The customer can activate this function when 
he/she leaves the vehicle for a short time and then wishes to resume driving, for example to refuel the 
car, and would like to retain the pleasant interior temperature. As with residual heating, residual cool¬ 
ing can be activated with the ignition switched off by pressing the button for increasing the air volume. 
The interior temperature is then maintained for up to 6 minutes. With temperatures above 59 °F the 
AC will operate and with temperatures below 59 °F the residual heating will take over.
