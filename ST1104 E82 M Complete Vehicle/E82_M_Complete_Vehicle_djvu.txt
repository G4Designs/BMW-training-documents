E82 M Complete Vehicle 
1. Introduction 


For customers with especially high expectations of the performance characteristics of their BMW 1 
Series, BMW M GmbH now offers an M Coupe based on the BMW E82 135i Coupe with an even more 
powerful engine and a modified BMW E9x M3 chassis and suspension set-up including the M variable 
differential lock. The modifications are designed for a spirited driving experience and encompass the 
powertrain, chassis and suspension as well as the body and interior. 

Owners of the BMW E82 M Coupe will benefit from the company's extensive knowledge in the devel¬ 
opment and production of M vehicles. In terms of the concept, parallels with the BMW E30 M3 cannot 
be denied. Sports visual styling, rigorous use of lightweight design and a powerful, performance-orien¬ 
tated engine. 

Market launch of the BMW E82 M Coupe takes place in May 2011. This vehicle will be produced at the 
Leipzig plant in Germany.. 


1.1. M-specific exterior equipment 

To optimize the visual styling, the airflow and the downforce, the BMW E82 M Coupe has a new front 
and rear bumper cover, rocker panels and M door mirrors. 

The headlights are the same as the E82 LCI model. 



E82 M Coupe front three-quarter view 

The E82 M Coupe is offered in the new exterior color, Valencia orange metallic. It will also be available 
in Alpine white and Black sapphire metallic. 

The visual distinctions from the BMW 135i include not only the exclusive exterior color but also the M 
front bumper, the flared wheel arches, the M3 door mirrors on 1 Series pedestal mounts and the 19- 
inch M wheels with different tire sizes front and rear. 

The front fender is new and has been widened to accommodate the BMW E9x M3 suspension and fin¬ 
ished off with an M gill.

4. Special technical features 

4.1. N54B30T0 engine 

The BMW E82 M Coupe uses the 250 kW/335 bhp N54B30T0 engine familiar from the BMW Z4 
sDrive35is. That puts the increase in power compared with the BMW 135i at 25 kW/35 bhp. The en¬ 
gine in the BMW E82 M Coupe is visually distinguished by the inscription "Powered by BMW M" on 
the engine cover. 



E82 M Coupe N54B30T0 engine 


The engine management (DME) used is once again the MSD81. 

The engine maps have been configured for even greater responsiveness and higher-performance 
power progression. 

A weight-optimized 11.4 kg dual-mass flywheel weight is used (BMW 135i/Z4 sDrive35is weighs 12.8 

kg). 

A_ 

Due to the weight-optimized dual-mass flywheel, slight rattling noises may be discernible under unfa¬ 
vorable conditions such as high outside temperatures, refer to the owners manual for more informa¬ 
tion. 


The clutch is identical the one used on the BMW 135i with the 500Nm (369 ft lbs) torque transmis¬ 
sion.

4. Special technical features 

4.1.2. M Engine dynamics control 

As on the BMW Z4 sDrive35is, the maximum torque of 450Nm/295 ft lbs is briefly raised (for five sec¬ 
onds max.) to 500Nm/369 ft lbs by the overboost function. The precondition for the overboost func¬ 
tion is a demand for acceleration of more than 80%. The increased torque is available from as low as 
1,500 rpm right through to 4,500 rpm. That means that the torque gain can be as much as 100 Nm 
compared to the BMW 135i. 

Although in the first two gears the loss of traction limits the amount of power and torque that can be 
transmitted, more than 450Nm/295 ft lbs can be delivered from third gear on, and 500Nm/369 ft lbs 
from fourth gear on. When the DSC is active and maximum acceleration is called for, forward thrust is 
limited in first, second and third gears in favor of handling stability. Configuration is based on the opti¬ 
mum traction. 

The M button on the steering wheel is an even more high-performance engine map. This function is 
comparable with the M Engine dynamics control Sports mode on the BMW E9x M3. On that model, 
it is activated by the Power button on the center console. When M Engine dynamics control Sports 
mode is active, the DSC modulation may be called into action more frequently. 




E82 M Coupe M button on steering wheel 

On the instrument cluster, the M Engine dynamics control Sports mode is indicated by the word 
SPORT on the display. 



E82 M Coupe M (Sports) mode indication 


The effect of the M Engine dynamics control Sports mode on the BMW E82 M Coupe is to further in¬ 
crease the responsiveness of the acceleration compared with the already very direct response of the 
basic setting (conversion of pedal sensor position to power delivery). 

In addition, control of the turbocharger wastegate valves is programmed for maximum turbocharger 
speed in the lower power band for enhanced responsiveness. This produces a further gain in dynamic 
response when accelerating from a constant speed and adopting a positive driving style. 


14 




E82 M Complete Vehicle 
4. Special technical features 

In normally aspirated mode the wastegate valve control is configured as on the BMW Z4 sDrive35is. 

The Blow-off valves are controlled directly by the intake manifold vacuum as on the N54 engine series 
(control starts at 150 mbar, open at 300 mbar). 

4.1.3. Cooling system 

An extra coolant to air heat exchanger is fitted behind the front left side of the bumper cover (taken 
from the E82 performance package). Furthermore, an 850 W electric fan is used as on the BMW E9x 
M3, (600 W is used on BMW 135i/Z4 sDrive35is).

4.1.4. Exhaust system 

The design of the primary catalytic converters is the same as for the N54B30T0 on the BMW Z4 
sDrive35is except that the flange positioning is different. The catalytic converters are as on the 135i. 
The front muffler has been modified for a more sports-type sound and optimized exhaust flow. The 
rear muffler is a new design with four chrome tail pipes without controlled flaps. 

4.1.5. Service 

As always for M models, a running-in check is required at 2,000 km/1,200 miles. 

The running-in check includes engine oil change, manual gearbox and rear differential. 

Refer to SI BOO 01 10 dated May 2011 

A_ 

Note: The oil level indicator is not M-specific but identical to those for the BMW 135i.. 


4.2. K manual gearbox GS6-45BZ 

The BMW E82 M Coupe uses the GS6-45BZ manual gearbox referred to for short as the K gearbox. 


16 












E82 M Complete Vehicle 
4. Special technical features 

Highlights 

• Six-speed gearbox with optimized transmission ratios 

• Intermediate bearings 

• Dry-sump lubrication 

• Synchromeshes with carbon friction linings 

• Oil change intervals as for BMW E9x M3 manual gearbox, i.e. including at 2,000 km/1,200 
miles running-in check 

High-precision shifting achieved by: 

• The use of a newly developed carbon friction lining on the synchromesh units 

• A newly developed and very low-friction shift mechanism 

• The low drag losses of the gear train 

• Limiting excessive shift travel 

The gearbox has been tested and approved for a maximum torque of 500 Nm for the E82. Testing was 
based on the permissible gross weight and the maximum possible forward thrust. 

To keep the drag losses low, dry-sump lubrication is used. Compared with conventional immersion lu¬ 
brication, this prevents the swash losses from the movement of the gear train in the sump oil. Further 
reduction of losses is achieved by the friction-optimized radial shaft seals.

Conventional manual transmissions normally use splash lubrication. During this process, the gears 
on the countershaft dip into the transmission oil and distribute it throughout the transmission in a dis¬ 
orderly manner as the gear set rotates. Often, additional equipment such as oil partition plates or oil 
grooves are required to bring the oil to the gears, the bearings or to the synchronizers. 

The K transmission with dry sump type lubrication system was used for the first time on the BMW 5 
Series F10.

4.3.1. Driveshaft 

The front section of the driveshaft is based on that of the BMW E82 with N55 engine and the rear sec¬ 
tion on that of the BMW E9x M3 with its length modified. The driveshaft is hollow and for optimum 
crash characteristics has a graduated profile and a flexible disc coupling at the gearbox end. As typical 
on M models, the driveshaft attaches to the differential by means of a constant velocity joint. 

A_ 

The driveshaft center bearing can be fitted facing two ways, as on the BMW E9x M3. It is important 
that the side marked "TOP" is fitted facing the body.

4.3.2. Rear axle final drive 

The BMW E82 M Coupe has the rear differential unit from the BMW E9x M3 and is thus also equipped 
with the "M variable differential lock" including differential enhancements developed over three gener¬ 
ations of the unit. 

The size of the ring gear is 215 mm and the final drive ratio is 3.15:1. 




E82 M Coupe rear differential 


A 

As M differentials continue to be the subject of complaints in this regard, the following note is worth 
repeating: 

For reasons inherent in differential function, the left and right differential output shafts and flanges 
to which the half-shafts are attached are different lengths inside the differential. As a result, when 
they are not under load, there is a noticeably different, design-related amount of vertical play in the 
two flanges. This does not impair the function and is not a justifiable reason for complaint. The larger 
amount of play on one side is present on all models with the M variable differential lock and may, de¬ 
pending on the version and model, affect either the left or the right flange.

Ring gear 


The pinion shaft bearings have been constructed as friction-optimized double angular-contact ball 
bearings since the BMW E9x M3. The differential housing has been modified to accept the double an¬ 
gular-contact ball bearings. The size 215 differential gearing (ring gear diameter 215 mm) has been 
optimized for low temperature and noise generation. A reduced-friction gear-tooth design is used. 

M variable differential lock 

This unique M locking differential design was first used on the BMW E46 M3, then on the BMW E6x 
M5/M6 and the BMW E9x M3. The way it operates is described in ST041 E46 M3 training material. 

The function of the M variable differential lock enables the BMW E82 M Coupe to obtain optimum 
traction at any engine speed an in any driving situation.

4.4. M chassis and suspension 

In order to ensure controlled handling dynamics, the BMW E82 M Coupe benefits from almost the en¬ 
tire BMW E9x M3 chassis and suspension. The only differences are the front subframe carried over 
from the BMW E82 1351 and the absence of the stiffening plate (M3 has stiffening plate). 

The M suspension strut brace (stronger strut mounting attachment than 1351) familiar from the M3 is 
also used. The length of the braces is modified.

4.4.2. Steering 

The hydraulically assisted rack-and-pinion steering has been carried over unchanged from the BMW 
E9x M3. With an average overall ratio for the variable gearing of 12.5:1 it is direct as a sports model 
(16:1 on 1351). The power assistance is controlled by the Junction Box control unit via the Servotronic 
valve according to a set sports characteristic. Active steering is not offered.

4.4.4. M Dynamic Mode 

An M-specific configuration of the DSC dynamic stability control takes account of the greater dynam¬ 
ic handling potential of the BMW E82 M Coupe. That includes the M Dynamic Mode, MDM, which rep¬ 
resents an M-specifically adapted DTC dynamic traction control function with modified modulation 
thresholds. It enables even greater linear and lateral acceleration with limited stability modulation for 
sports handling. Only at the absolute limit of stability does the system intervene by reducing engine 
power and individually operating the brakes to maintain stability. 

M Dynamic Mode is activated by briefly pressing the DSC OFF button between the center air vents in 
the instrument panel.

It is indicated by the inscription MDM together with the DSC OFF symbol on the instrument cluster. 
Pressing and holding the button for > 3 seconds completely deactivates the DSC. The MDM light then 
goes out while the DSC OFF symbol remains lit. 

The braking system on the BMW E82 M Coupe is the same as on the BMW E9x M3. As typical on M 
models, the brake disc is centred by three locating pins (for dimensions see technical data). As distinct 
from the current BMW M models, only the left front and left rear wheels are fitted with brake pad wear 
sensors (typical on M models is front left and right and rear right). 

Optimum transmission of the different acceleration torque and braking torque levels is ensured by the 
different tire sizes front and back fitted on 19-inch, double-spoke design M light alloy wheels (styling 
359 M) from the BMW M3 Competition package (for dimensions see technical data).

5. Service information 

5.1. N54B30T0 engine 

A 

Due to the weight-optimized dual-mass flywheel, slight rattling noises may be discernible under unfa¬ 
vorable conditions such as high outside temperatures. 

Owners are made aware of this in the Owner's Manual. 


A_ 

The oil level indicator is not M-specific but identical to those for the BMW 135i. At the 2,000 km / 
1,200 mile running-in check, the engine oil, gearbox and differential oil is changed. 

Refer to SI BOO 01 10 dated May 2011 


5.2. Driveshaft/Rear axle final drive 

A 

The driveshaft center bearing can be fitted facing two ways, as on the BMW E9x M3. It is important 
that the side marked "TOP" is fitted facing up towards the body. 


A 

As M differentials continue to be the subject of complaints in this regard, the following note is worth 
repeating: 

For reasons inherent in differential function, the left and right differential output shafts and flanges 
to which the half-shafts are attached are different lengths inside the differential. As a result, when 
they are not under load, there is a noticeably different, design-related amount of vertical play in the 
two flanges. This does not impair the function and is not a justifiable reason for complaint. The larger 
amount of play on one side is present on all models with the M variable differential lock and may, de¬ 
pendent on the version and model, affect either the left or the right flange. 


5.3. M chassis and suspension 

On the standard E9x, the front spring strut is a parallel design and is held only by the clamping force of 
the mount. 

The spring strut on the E82 M Coupe/E9x M3 has a taper at its lower end that locates firmly in the hub 
carrier. 

When being fitted, the M spring strut is pulled into the lower taper by a special tool.
