112 Powertrain 

1. Introduction 

1.1. Overview 

A newly developed drivetrain is used with the BMW i8 - development code 112. This innovative drive 
concept combines two high-performance drives in one vehicle. A high-performance 3-cylinder 
gasoline engine with 6-speed automatic transmission provides the drive at the rear axle. An electrical 
machine in combination with a 2-speed manual gearbox provides the drive at the front axle. Due to 
the intelligent interaction of the drives the 112 has the vehicle performance of a sports car with the 
efficiency of a compact car.

112 Powertrain 

1. Introduction 


This axle hybrid configuration (which is being used for the first time at BMW) creates an individually 
controllable all-wheel drive system that was developed without additional components. The 
coordination of the front and rear drive torque enables an efficient drivetrain, which can be individually 
adapted to every driving situation.

1. introduction 


Unlike with the other hybrid systems, with the axle hybrid (D) the respective axles of the vehicles 
are driven independently of each other. The only connection between the two axles is the road. 

It is therefore possible to drive the vehicle with the use of both drive systems at the same time or 
individually depending on the situation. With sufficient capacity of the high-voltage battery, greater 
distances can be covered, emission-free and quietly using the electric drivetrain. The design of the 
combustion engine also enables a larger range and a sporty driving style with low fuel consumption 
(particularly in combination with the electric drive). The installation of two electrical machines allows 
for a high degree of flexibility in the design of the operating strategy. This type of hybrid system is 
designed for coping with future challenges in the urban environment. 


1.2. Mid-engine 

For the first time since 1978 a mid-engine configuration is used again in a BMW. In the BMW Ml (E26) 
a 204 kW / 273 hp 6-cylinder gasoline engine (M88/1) was used. Only a low volume of these engines 
were produced. 

The designation mid-engine describes the installation position of the combustion engine. The 
combustion engine always sits between the axles of a vehicle. The combustion engine with a manual 
gearbox in front of the (driven) rear axle and behind the passenger compartment is characteristic of the 
mid-engine design. This is also the case in the 112. A transverse mounted 3-cylinder gasoline engine 
with a power rating of 170 kW / 231 hp (mounted in front of the rear axle) also drives the rear axle. 

The advantages of the mid-engine design are: 

• Higher cornering speeds are possible 

The mid-engine allows approximately the same weight distribution to the front and rear axle, 
as well as a mass concentration near the vehicle's center of gravity. This results in a neutral 
driveability, which enables high cornering speeds. 

• More spontaneous steering while cornering 

The mass concentration near the vehicle's center of gravity brings about a low inertia torque 
around the vertical vehicle axis. The vehicle is thus more agile and maneuverable. 

• Enhanced passive safety 

The larger space in the front and rear area allows a better design of the crumple zones and the 
pedestrian protection. 

• Increased design possibilities of the front section 

Aerodynamic advantages can be made easier as a result of the greater freedom in design.

1. Introduction 


Unlike in standard design vehicles, the B38 Top engine in the 112 is accessed via the (tailgate) rear 
engine compartment lid. After the cover is removed, the combustion engine is accessible from above. 

It is possible, for example, to top off the engine oil, replace the spark plugs or the air filter element from 
this location. The oil filter element for the engine oil is accessible from below. All other service-relevant 
interfaces can be reached as usual via the front engine compartment lid.

2.3. Changes 

The following list provides an overview of the changes to the previous B38 engines. 

Engine mechanics 

• The crankcase was adapted to the front installation position of the mechanical coolant pump. 
This is necessary for space reasons as the high-voltage starter motor generator and the intake 
air system require more space. 

• The diameters of the main bearings and connecting rod bearings were increased to 50 mm. 

• The cylinder head is manufactured in the gravity casting procedure. As a result, the cylinder 
head has a higher density and a higher stability. 

• The shaft diameter of the exhaust valves was increased to 6 mm. This prevents valve 
vibrations which would otherwise occur due to the high charging pressure with the valve 
overlap. 

Oil supply 

• A 1 kg / 2.2 lbs lighter oil pump, as the function of the integrated mechanical vacuum pump is 
assumed by the electrical vacuum pump. 

• The anti-roll bar link is connected on the front oil sump side. 

Belt drive 

• Newly developed belt drive. The combustion engine is started via a high-voltage starter motor 
generator. A conventional pinion style starter motor is not installed. 

• The bearings of the drive shaft in the housing of the mechanical coolant pump were reinforced 
due to the greater forces in the belt drive. 

• The air conditioning compressor in the belt drive is also not installed. It is replaced with an 
EKK at the electrical machine. 

• Newly developed belt tensioner. 

• Drive belt was widened from six to eight ribs. 

• Adapted vibration damper with disconnected belt pulley. 

Intake air and exhaust emission systems 

• Twin-pipe unfiltered-air intake, actuator depending on the situation. Which can be switched by 
a Local Interconnect Network (LIN) 

• First use of a water-cooled throttle valve. 

• The charge air cooling is carried out using an indirect charge air cooler, which is integrated in 
the intake air system. 

• The turbine housing of the exhaust turbocharger was integrated in the steel manifold. 

• The charging pressure of up to 1.5 bar is reached by modified variable turbine geometry and 
controlled by an electrical wastegate valve. 

• The cooling of the exhaust turbocharger is done via the bearing seat.

112 Powertrain 

2. B38 Top Engine 

2.4. Belt drive 

The belt drive of the B38 Top engine is different to that of the B38 engine. Instead of the alternator, in 
the 112 a high-voltage starter motor generator is used which can provide sufficient electrical energy to 
the high-voltage battery for charging. Other tasks of the high-voltage starter motor generator include: 

• Vehicle electrical system supply 

• Starting the combustion engine 

• Load point increase of the combustion engine 

• Boost function of the combustion engine 

There is no longer a conventional starter motor in the 112. 

The belt drive of the 112 had to be adapted for the integration of the high-voltage starter motor 
generator and the modified loading. A new belt tensioner is used in order to be able to safely transfer 
the maximum torque of 50 Nm / 37 lb ft in the belt drive which the starter motor generator produces 
during engine operation. As a result of the greater forces, the drive shaft bearing of the mechanical 
coolant pump was reinforced, the drive belt widened and the vibration damper with disconnected belt 
pulley adapted to the modified requirements.

2.4.1. Pendulum belt tensioner 

The housing of the pendulum belt tensioner is mounted directly to the housing of the high-voltage 
starter motor generator using three bolts. A tension spring generates the clamping force and transmits 
this to the drive belt via two tensioning pulleys. The two tensioning pulleys can be turned towards each 
other and towards the housing via a radial bearing. Thanks to this intelligent design the pendulum belt 
tensioner is always adapted to the drive belt depending on the load, ensuring sufficient tension in the 
belt drive.

A_ 

After the pendulum belt tensioner is secured at the housing and the drive belt has been properly 
installed, the assembly bolt must be removed. Using the open-end wrench relax the pendulum belt 
tensioner in an counter-clockwise direction until the assembly bolt can be removed. 


Start and Boost function 

BMW engines are typically right-turning engines. When looking at the engine from the front (opposite 
end of the output side) the crankshaft rotates in a clockwise direction. To start the combustion engine 
after a start-stop phase or during an electric drive, the high-voltage starter motor generator has to 
rotate the combustion engine. The upper part of the drive belt is pulled taut and the lower part is 
relaxed. To prevent the drive belt from slipping, the movable pendulum belt tensioner keeps the lower 
part under tension. The operating principle of the pendulum belt tensioner during the Boost function is 
identical to the operating principle applied during start-up.

Energy recovery 

When energy is recovered via the high-voltage starter motor generator, it extracts the energy from the 
combustion engine. The combustion engine now powers the high-voltage starter motor generator. 
The lower part of the drive belt is pulled taut and the upper part is relaxed. To prevent the belt slipping 
during energy recovery, the moveable pendulum belt tensioner keeps the upper part under tension.

2.4.2. Vibration damper with disconnected belt pulley 

Due to the 3-cylinder design, in the belt drive the torsional vibrations of the B38 Top engine must be 
counteracted. For this reason a vibration damper with disconnected belt pulley is used in the 112. Its 
operating principle is similar to that of a dual-mass flywheel.

Similar to other BMW models, the vibration damper consists of a fixed pulley (1, small mass) and a 
flywheel (3, large mass). These are connected by a damping element (2) and can rotate freely by a few 
angular degrees. The fixed pulley (1) is bolted to the front end face of the crankshaft. 


16 



































112 Powertrain 

2. B38 Top Engine 

To avoid a transmission of the torsional vibrations from the engine or the crankshaft to the belt drive, a 
disconnected belt pulley (4) is used. This is positioned on the connection hub using a ball bearing (8) 
and rotates opposite the crankshaft. Two bow springs (5, 6) with different diameters counteract this 
rotation in the inside of the belt pulley (4). They are supported at a connecting flange (9) and thus 
reduce the arising oscillations. The space in the belt pulley where the bow springs are located is filled 
with a grease filling. This grease filling increases the service life of the bow springs and reduces their 
noise emissions. Friction rings (11) between the vibration damper and the belt pulley seal the belt 
pulley, thus protecting the interior from contamination. 

In the event of emerging grease, the vibration damper with disconnected belt pulley must be replaced.

2.5. Intake air and exhaust emission systems 

2.5.1. Intake air system 

The intake air system in the 112 is a completely new development. The most striking feature is the 
twin-pipe unfiltered-air intake. It is divided into a performance path and an acoustic path. A water- 
cooled throttle valve is also used for the first time. A heat exchanger/intercooler in the intake manifold 
is responsible for cooling the charge air.

Intake manifold 


The air inlet of the performance path (12) is located behind the left wheel arch cover at the rear axle. 

At the end of the unfiltered-air pipe is an unfiltered-air flap (13), which is also the intake for the intake 
silencer (14). Via an integrated unfiltered-air flap controller the DME can control the unfiltered-air 
flap (13) with help of a pulse-width modulated signal and thus close the performance path (12). This 
happens between an engine speed of 3000 and 4500 rpm. If the performance path is closed in this 
engine speed range, the intake is carried out via the acoustic path (11). This measure prevents an 
annoying, higher frequency noise. 

A_ 

If annoying noises occur during the operation of the combustion engine, the function of the unfiltered- 
air flap must be checked. 


In order to protect the electronics of the throttle valve (2) against thermal damage, it is water- 
cooled. This is necessary in the 112 as the throttle valve is located upstream of the indirect charge air 
intercooler (16). Due to the high operating temperature the boost pressure sensor (1) was mounted at 
the intake air system. It is connected to the throttle valve via a hose. The water-cooled throttle valve 
is installed in the low-temperature cooling circuit and is located in a parallel path to the high-voltage 
starter motor generator.

The charge air cooling was adapted to the installation location of the engine in the 112. The charge air 
cooler is not located at the front in the cooling module, but directly in the intake air system. It is indirect 
charge air cooling. The heat from the charged air is not emitted directly to the surrounding area via an 
air to air heat exchanger, but to the coolant. The coolant absorbs the heat energy and releases it again 
in the cooling module. With this system, the distance of the charge air line can be very short, whereby 
minimal losses of pressure occur and excellent load charge performance is achieved. 

The plastic intake air system is located at the intake side of the combustion engine. The tank vent 
valve and the intake-manifold pressure sensor are located on the intake air system.

2. B38 Top Engine 


Due to the high exhaust-gas temperatures the exhaust manifold (unlike in the previous B38 engine) 
is made from steel and is cooled using coolant via the bearing seat. The exhaust manifold is also the 
turbine housing of the turbocharger. The turbocharger in the 112 has a conventional design (no variable 
turbine geometry, no twin-scroll). The charging pressure (boost) is controlled via an electronically 
controlled wastegate. 

The B38 Top engine has a catalytic converter with two ceramic monoliths. The catalytic converter is 
arranged close to the engine behind the turbine of the turbocharger. This short exhaust pipe ensures 
the operating temperature of the catalytic converter is reached quickly. The engine satisfies the strict 
requirements ULEV 2 exhaust emission standards. The familiar Bosch oxygen sensors are used: 

• Pre oxygen sensor: LSU ADV 

• Post oxygen sensor: LSF 4.2 

The control sensor is located ahead of the catalytic converter, as close as possible to the turbine 
outlet. The monitoring sensor is positioned between the first and second ceramic monoliths. 

In order to protect the body from excessive heat, insulation elements are attached in the 
corresponding areas at the exhaust system. 

There is an exhaust flap in one of the two exhaust tailpipes which are not visible from the outside. This 
exhaust flap is controlled by the DME and is closed in idle position, at low load and in coasting/overrun 
mode. As a result, the noise level of the combustion engine is reduced. At high load the exhaust flap is 
opened, whereby the exhaust gas back-pressure is reduced and the engine performance is increased. 
The exhaust flap can be replaced separately from the rear silencer. 


2.6. Fuel system 


2.6.1. Fuel preparation 

The following overview shows the fuel preparation of the B38Top engine in the 112. The high pressure 
pump powered by the exhaust camshaft supplies the fuel rail with the directly mounted fuel injectors 
with fuel. The high pressure lines between the fuel rail and fuel injectors could therefore be deleted. 
The fuel enters the cylinder combustion chamber directly via the electrically activated fuel injectors at 
up to 200 bar. The activation of the fuel injectors and evaluation of the rail pressure sensor are done 
by the DME. Overall, this results in a more compact design of the fuel preparation system with fewer 
connection points.

Work on the fuel system is only permitted after the combustion engine has cooled down. The coolant 
temperature must not exceed 40 °C /104 °F. This must be observed at all times, otherwise there is a 
risk of fuel being sprayed due to residual pressure in the fuel system. 


When working on the fuel system, it is essential to adhere to conditions of absolute cleanliness and to 
observe the work sequences described in the repair instructions. Even the slightest contamination and 
damage to the screw connections of the fuel lines can cause leaks.

2.6.2. Fuel supply 

The 112 is equipped with a pressurized fuel tank made from stainless steel to supply the combustion 
engine. As a result during purely electric driving it is guaranteed that the gasoline fumes remain in the 
pressurized fuel tank. Only with the operation of the combustion engine is fresh air drawn in by the 
carbon canister for purging and the gasoline fumes are directed to the combustion chamber via the 
differentiated air intake air system. The fuel tank has a usable volume of 42 liters /11.1 gallons.

The components in the inside of the pressurized fuel tank are technically not new. The electric fuel 
pump is activated via the fuel pump control module. It receives a request from the DME via a pulse- 
width modulated signal to control the electric fuel pump. The fuel pressure in the feed line is about 
5 bar and is regulated at this level via a pressure-limiting valve directly after the electric fuel pump.

The relay for the electric fuel pump was replaced with a corresponding control unit which assumes 
the control of the electric fuel pump. In the event of a crash this control unit immediately switches off 
the electric fuel pump. The control unit receives the information via a separate line from the ACSM. In 
addition, in this case the fuel tank non-return valve is supplied with current and closed by the hybrid 
pressure refuelling electronic control unit. This way possible gasoline fumes are prevented from 
escaping into the ambient air. The fault code entry set prevents subsequent refuelling of the vehicle 
and all other functions of the fuel supply system (OBD, tank leak diagnosis).

Refuelling 

The pressurized fuel tank must be released for refuelling. This is ensured by the fact that the refuelling 
request is indicated to the electronics by a button in the driver's door. 



112 Refuelling button 


Index 

Explanation 

1 

Refuelling button 


The hybrid pressure refuelling electronic control unit (TFE) monitors the current operating condition 
via a pressure/temperature sensor in the fuel tank and then controls the pressure reduction by opening 
a fuel tank isolation valve. The cleaned gasoline fumes are released into the environment by the carbon 
canister. The actuator drive for locking the fuel filler flap is activated and the fuel filler flap with fuel filler 
cap can be opened manually. 

A_ 

Before repair work on the fuel supply is started, the refuelling procedure must be started so that the 
pressure in the fuel tank can be released. Leave the fuel filler cap open during repair work in order to 
avoid pressure building up again. 


At the same time, the driver receives the status of the tank readiness displayed in the instrument 
cluster and in the central information display (CID). If the fuel filler flap is not opened within 10 minutes 
after the fuel filler cap has been released, it is automatically locked again. The position of the fuel filler 
flap is identified using a hall effect sensor. 

After the refuelling procedure and the fuel filler cap is closed the fuel filler flap is locked again via the 
hybrid pressure refuelling electronic control unit and the fuel tank isolation valve closed. 

A_ 

Filling the fuel tank while the high-voltage battery is charging is not permitted! When the charging 
cable is connected, ensure sufficient safety distance to highly flammable materials. Otherwise, there 
is a risk of personal injury or material damage in the event of improper connection or disconnection of 
the charging cable.

2. B38 Top Engine 

Tank leak diagnosis 

The tank leak diagnosis, which is only used in US market vehicles, is a passive diagnosis. In 
conventional vehicles, a defined excess pressure was applied to the fuel tank using a high pressure 
pump. This no longer takes place in the 112. A high pressure pump is no longer used. 

After the journey is ended (terminal 15 OFF) a test of the tank leak diagnosis is initiated by the hybrid 
pressure refuelling electronic control unit (TFE) control unit. This is carried out over a period of about 
6 hours. In this period the temperature and the pressure in the stainless steel tank is measured. As the 
pressure changes depending on the temperature, it is possible for the control unit to identify a loss of 
pressure in the fuel tank. A prerequisite is therefore that the temperature changes over the test period. 
If this does not happen no results can be concluded. 

The ambient air pressure is also included in the calculation. A sensor in the DME calculates this and 
provides the information to the hybrid pressure refuelling electronic control unit via the PT-CAN. 

If during the test phase the vehicle is started no result can be evaluated. After each journey is ended 
the tank leak diagnosis starts anew. 

Following a comparison of the measured pressure readings with the saved characteristic curve in the 
control unit, information is transmitted to the DME via the PT-CAN in the case of a deviation from the 
hybrid pressure refuelling electronic control unit. A corresponding entry is set in the control unit. This 
happens when the ignition is switched on in the vehicle. 


2.7. High-temperature cooling circuit 

In the 112 two separate cooling circuits are used. A high-temperature cooling circuit and a low- 
temperature cooling circuit. This is necessary as the different temperature levels required cannot be 
combined in one circuit. The two cooling circuits guarantee that the thermal operating safety of the 
respective components is achieved in every situation. 

Due to the high efficiency of the electrical machines and power electronics, considerably less heat 
is emitted than with the combustion engine. For this reason the components to be cooled are 
incorporated (according to their heat dissipation and their cooling requirement) into corresponding 
cooling circuits. The components which have high heat dissipation are combined in the high- 
temperature cooling circuit (e.g. combustion engine, exhaust turbocharger). The components which 
have low heat dissipation and a high cooling requirement are combined in the low-temperature cooling 
circuit (e.g. electrical machine, integrated charge air cooler, throttle valve). 

Similar to the cooling systems of current BMW vehicles with combustion engines, the control in 
the 112 is also done depending on the cooling requirement. This control is integrated in the high- 
temperature cooling circuit in the DME. 

Only the high-temperature cooling circuit is described in this training module. As some of the 
components in this training module (such as the indirect charge air cooler) are in the low-temperature 
cooling circuit, a brief description is provided at the end of this chapter for better understanding. More 
precise information on the low-temperature cooling circuit can be found in the "112 High-voltage 
Components" training manual.

Electric heating 


The high-temperature cooling circuit assumes the task of dissipating heat from the combustion 
engine and ensuring the thermal operating safety of the respective components. Similar to 
conventional vehicles, it is also divided into a small and large cooling circuit. 

In order to be able to optimally use the excess heat of the combustion engine, the cooling circuit for 
heating the passenger compartment is integrated in the high-temperature cooling circuit. If the coolant 
has not reached a sufficiently high temperature for heating the passenger compartment, a changeover 
valve redirects the heater circuit from the high-temperature cooling circuit. The coolant is then heated 
by the electric heater and fed to the heat exchanger by a separate electric coolant pump. This may be 
the case, for example for purely electric driving. As the electric heating is a high-voltage component, 
the precise functions and further information can be found in the "112 High-voltage Components" 
training manual. 

The mechanical coolant pump is on the front of the combustion engine (belt drive side). The map 
thermostat was flange-mounted at its housing. The bearing of the drive shaft in the mechanical 
coolant pump was reinforced. This is necessary because the combustion engine is started via the 
high-voltage starter motor generator in the belt drive and greater forces occur in the belt drive. An 
additional electric coolant pump assumes the cooling of the turbocharger. The engine oil-coolant heat 
exchanger together with the oil filter housing is secured directly at the crankcase of the combustion 
engine.

Radiator 


The cooling module in the front of the vehicle consists of a large radiator, three low-temperature 
radiators, an air conditioning condenser with receiver drier and an electric fan. The coolant in the high- 
temperature cooling circuit only flows through the large radiator and dissipates the heat energy to the 
surrounding area. 

There are two versions of the electric fan attached at the inside of the tilted cooling module. In the US 
variant the electric fan delivers up to 850 W. The DME is responsible for the activation of the cooling 
fan. 

The coolant expansion tank is located under the front engine compartment lid on the right. It can hold 
a volume of 2.3 liters and is equipped with an electrical level sensor. 


38 

























112 Powertrain 

2. B38 Top Engine 

In order to reduce the drag and the consumption of the vehicle, the 112 is equipped as standard with 
an active air-flap control. Depending on the cooling requirement, the air flaps only close or open the 
lower cooling air inlet in the front bumper. The DME activates an actuator via a LIN bus which opens 
the air flaps in up to three positions. The cooling air flowing in at the bottom is fed for the most part 
to the front brakes after the cooling module by cooling air ducts. The upper cooling air inlet is always 
done via the upper radiator grille. In the variant for hot countries the inlet opening of the radiator grille 
is bigger. A large amount of the cooling air drawn in at the top flows out again after the cooling module 
through the front engine compartment lid. 

Requirements for opening the air flaps: 

• Cooling requirement of drive components 

• Cooling requirement of heating and air-conditioning system 

• Afterrun requirement of electric fan 

• DSC requirement due to brake cooling 

The electrical auxiliary coolant pump for the turbocharger has a power rating of 20 W and is always 
switched off when the combustion engine is running. The DME activates the electrical auxiliary 
coolant pump after the combustion engine is shut down in order to keep the bearing seat of the 
turbocharger cool. 

An additional electric fan is used in the 112, located in the rear engine compartment (on the right side). 
This engine compartment fan ensures recirculation of the excess heat in the engine compartment and 
thus serves for cooling the combustion engine. To be able to fulfill this task, the engine compartment 
fan runs together with the combustion engine. The DME uses the rpm speed signal of the combustion 
engine. 

It is also possible that the engine compartment fan continues to run when the engine (which is at 
operating temperature) is off and/or the electric drive is used. The engine compartment fan is located 
behind the wheel arch on the right and is not visible from the outside and is mounted with an aluminum 
bracket between the rear axle module and the wheel arch. In order to calculate the temperature in 
the engine compartment, a separate temperature sensor is used. This is located close to the oil filler 
neck and in addition to the calculation of the engine compartment temperature is also used for the 
diagnosis of the engine compartment fan.

2.7.3. Service information 

The familiar mixture of 50:50 split of water and antifreeze and corrosion inhibitors in BMW vehicles is 
used as a coolant. 

Due to the complexity and size of the cooling system the vacuum filling device must always be 
used when filling the two cooling circuits. Only this way is it guaranteed that the cooling system is 
adequately bled. 

A_ 

A depressurized filling of the high-temperature cooling circuit by simple pouring into the coolant 
expansion tank is not permitted as the circuit cannot be adequately bled. The special tool for vacuum 
filling in accordance with the repair instructions must always be used. 

The system must be bled after the replacement of components in the cooling circuit. 


41 













112 Powertrain 

2. B38 Top Engine 

For the bleeding of the high-temperature cooling circuit proceed in the same way as the procedure for 
conventional vehicles. However, unlike in the low-temperature cooling circuit, the bleeding procedure 
does not end automatically, but must be independently completed by a Service employee. 

1 Evacuate and fill cooling system using vacuum filling device. Remove the vacuum filling device 
after the filling procedure is completed. 

2 When the expansion tank is open, open the bleeder screw for 20 seconds. 

3 Close the bleeder screw and expansion tank again. 

4 Terminal 15 ON, set IHKA controls to 28 °C / 82 °F at blower speed 1 and "Air conditioning OFF". 

5 Press the accelerator pedal for about 20 seconds at full load (engine OFF). 

6 Start combustion engine in selector lever position "P" with Automatic Hold brake engaged. 

7 Increase engine speed using accelerator pedal 4 times for about 5 to 10 seconds to roughly 
3500 rpm, with a 10 second interval between the respective engine speed increases. Repeat 
procedure every 2 minutes for about 16 to 18 minutes. 

8 Increase engine speed using accelerator pedal 4 times for about 5 to 10 seconds to roughly 
5500 rpm, with a 10 second interval between the respective engine speed increases. 

9 After 20 minutes carry out a test drive in selector lever position "S" and with heating turned on 
fully. 

10 The ventilation is completed as soon as hot air flows continuously from the air outlets. 

11 Adapt coolant in the cooled down state to MAX filling level. 

A 

The bleeding procedure must be cancelled immediately in the case of a yellow warning light due to 
excess temperature. In this case start again with point 1. 


The engine compartment temperature sensor is not used directly for controlling the engine 
compartment fan, but is required for its diagnosis, among other things. If there is a fault with the 
engine compartment temperature sensor or the engine compartment fan, the output torque of the 
combustion engine is reduced by the DME. 

A_ 

When terminal 15 is switched on the coolant pump and electric fan can be switched on automatically. 

A reason for this may be a cooling requirement in the low-temperature cooling circuit. Therefore 
always ensure terminal 15 is switched off when working with an open engine compartment lid or at the 
cooling module. 


A 

The coolant pump and the electric fan can be switched on automatically when charging the high- 
voltage battery. A reason for this may be a cooling requirement in the low-temperature cooling circuit 
or in the refrigerant circuit. The high-voltage battery cannot be charged when working with the engine 
compartment lid open or at the cooling module.

2.8. Low-temperature cooling circuit 

The low-temperature cooling circuit assumes the cooling of the high-voltage components (except 
the high-voltage battery unit) and the auxiliary units of the combustion engine. The cooling of the 
integrated charge air cooler is particularly important so that the combustion engine reaches its full 
power. Two independent electric coolant pumps (both 80 W) ensure the distribution of the coolant. 
They can be controlled depending on requirements, thus guaranteeing intelligent adaptation to the 
respective operating situation. Three radiators are used in the low-temperature cooling circuit.

2.9. Acoustic covers 



112 Installation locations of the acoustic covers 


The B38 Top engine in the 112 is completely enclosed by acoustic covers. They reduce engine and 
transmission noises. The acoustic covers are manufactured from lightweight foam and have non- 
woven fleece on both sides. Their form is adapted to the respective installation location. They also 
have aluminum covering in specific locations subject to high temperatures. 

As a result of the use of acoustic covers directly at the drivetrain, other acoustic measures at the body 
were able to be deleted so that the overall vehicle weight could be reduced.

2.10. Notes for Service 

For all work at the drive unit the instructions in the current repair instructions must be followed! 

Work on the high-voltage components can only be carried out by Service employees with the relevant 
certification ST 1408112 Complete Vehicle training course completed. 

Heat shields are installed for thermal operating safety in the engine compartment to protect the 
vehicle and engine components. They reflect the heat to insulate the components underneath. 



112 Installation location of heat shields 


Use extreme caution when handling heat shields and acoustic covers. Pay attention to the following: 

• Proper installation according to the repair instructions. 

• Heat shields and acoustic covers must be checked for damage before installation. 

• Any oil, grease or fuel residue must be removed before installation of the heat shields and 
acoustic covers.

The repair instructions must be followed precisely when handling heat shields and acoustic covers. 
Incorrect handling, particularly during installation, can cause serious damage to components or the

112. It has six forward gears and a reverse gear. 

The electronic transmission control (EGS) is located directly on the transmission housing. The selector 
lever position switch is designed as a hall effect sensor and integrated in the EGS. As a result of the 
mid-engine design there is no mechanical connection between the gear selector switch and the EGS. 
The selector shaft is operated using an electric motor with activation rod.

housing, cools the transmission oil. It is integrated in the low-temperature cooling circuit. The coolant 
volumetric flow is adjusted by a bypass valve.

3. Automatic Transmission 


An electric oil pump supplies the automatic transmission during electric driving and in engine start- 
stop phases with transmission oil. 

The following measures enable a high degree of efficiency of the transmission: 

• Transmission oil with low viscosity 

• Lower transmission oil main pressure 

• Low lubricant oil quantity 

• Large steering axis inclination 

• Accurate control of the multidisc converter lockup clutch at low loads by three line activation 

• Automatic transmission designed for automatic engine start-stop function (electrical 
transmission oil pump) 

The high ride and shifting comfort is realized with the following measures: 

• Newly developed mechanical torsional vibration damper 

• Optimized hydraulics with new valves 

• Optimized clutch and brake control 

• Improved direct shifting capability (explained in the following) 

In the Sport program and Manual mode the shift point and shift speed have a more sporty dynamics 
than in drive position D. 

Depending on the drive position (D = Automatic drive position, S = Sport program, M = Manual mode), 
the gearshifts are different in terms of their dynamic character, some have a more sportier dynamics. 
The maximum speed of 250 km/h /155 mph is reached in 5th gear. 

ConnectedShift 

The ConnectedShift function, known from the F10 LCI, is also used in the 112. In SPORT and 
COMFORT mode the ConnectedShift characteristic is adapted to the respective driving program. 

Launch Control 

Launch control enables optimal acceleration when driving off on a smooth roadway. Forced upshifts 
are also performed without a reduction of the engine torque. This enables additional acceleration 
during the gearshifts. 

To avoid premature component wear, launch control is limited to 100 times. The number of starts 
already performed with launch control can be read from the DME with help of the ISTA BMW diagnosis 
system.

3.1. Designation 

The transmission designation in the technical documentation allows it to be uniquely identified. In 
frequent cases, however, only a short designation. This short form is used so the transmission can be 
assigned to a transmission family. The GA8HP transmission family, consisting of the GA8HP45Z, the 
GA8HP70Z and the GA8HP90Z transmissions, among others, is often mentioned. 

The transmission designation GA6F21 AW comprises the following:

With the new automatic transmission of the 112 in most cases direct shifting to the desired gear is 
possible. This also applies if gears are skipped. 

A direct gear change is always possible if the status has to change for one of the switched clutches or 
brakes. Otherwise, a two-stage gear change is effected. However, in general the customer does not 
notice this due to the optimized transmission control unit. 

The following table shows the switched brakes and clutches for each gear.

112 Powertrain 
3. Automatic Transmission 


To rotate the selector shaft of the transmission, an activation rod and a drive position actuator are 
attached outside the transmission. The activation rod is connected on both sides via a ball joint to a 
lever of the drive position actuator and the drive position lever. The swivel motion of the operating lever 
at the drive position actuator is transferred to the drive position lever via the activation rod and the 
drive position is engaged. Changing the drive position from P to D takes less than half a second. 

The drive position actuator is a direct current electric motor with planetary gear and two position 
sensors. All components are located in a housing and form one unit. The electric motor in the drive 
position actuator is activated directly by an output stage in the electrical machine electronics. The 
output stage is current-limited to protect against damage by a short circuit. In order not to overload 
the electric motor, the power consumption is also measured and a current limitation performed in the 
software of the electrical machine electronics. 

The electric motor is supplied with current until the travel sensors display that the drive position 
actuator has adopted the desired condition. The travel sensors work according to the hall-effect 
principle and record the movement in the transmission of the drive position actuator. For reasons of 
redundancy, two travel sensors are used and their values are adjusted to those of the selector lever 
position switch.

The connection between the activation rod and drive position lever can be removed. In this way the 
parking lock can be manually unlocked by the Service employee in the event of a fault. The drive 
position lever must be put into selector lever position N. This is only possible when the intake silencer 
is removed. There is no option planned for the customer to perform an emergency operation of the 
parking lock.

Unlocking the parking lock serves only to be able to move the vehicle in an emergency. The 112 
cannot be towed away in the traditional way. It can only be transported on a flatbed truck. 

The EME performs several self-diagnosis functions in order to ensure the proper function of the drive 
position actuator and to protect the components against damage. These self-diagnosis functions are: 

• Monitoring of lines for the electric motor, the travel sensors and the solenoids for short circuit 
against ground and supply voltage, as well as for open circuit. 

• Monitoring of the current level for the electric motor with regards to the maximum value and 
plausibility for the signals of the travel sensors. 

• Monitoring of the signals of the travel sensors (plausibility of the two signals to each other). 
The drive position actuator must be taught in using the diagnosis system, if: 

• the automatic transmission has been replaced 

• the activation rod has been removed or replaced 

• the drive position actuator has been replaced 

• the EME or the EGS has been replaced 

• the software of the EME has been updated 

Before the initialization via the diagnosis system, several prerequisites must be satisfied: 

• The vehicle must be secured against rolling away. 

• The drive position actuator and the drive position lever are secured properly. 

• The drive position actuator and the drive position lever at the transmission are at position N. 

• The locking element at the thread of the activation rod is engaged. 

• The high-voltage system is deactivated. 

• Terminal 15 is switched on.

3.6.1. Electrical transmission oil pump 

Similar to all automatic transmissions, in the GA6F21 AW an internal mechanical transmission oil 
pump at the transmission input assumes the oil supply of the hydraulic system. However, there are 
driving situations in which the combustion engine is switched off and the electric motor is used. This 
means for the automatic transmission no speed at the transmission input (resulting in no oil supply by 
the mechanical transmission oil pump), but a speed at the transmission output via the wheels. This 
difference in speed is reduced in the automatic transmission and requires lubrication. 

Due to the internal leakage, the oil in the transmission mechatronics flows back to the oil sump. 

This effect must be prevented upon a restart of the combustion engine (automatic engine start-stop 
function or from electric driving to driving with combustion engine) so that gears can be changed as 
quickly as possible. 

In order to be able to perform these two necessary functions, an additional electrical transmission oil 
pump with a power rating of 80 W is installed. 

The entire system of the electrical transmission oil pump is similar to a power steering pump (internal 
gear pump) and the electric motor at the converter housing, as well as the control electronics for the 
transmission oil pump, which is designed as a separate control unit. It sits at the rear axle module 
directly above the range extender electrical machine electronics and does not have diagnostic 
capability. The electric motor of the electrical transmission oil pump is supplied with AC voltage 
(low voltage). The inverter (DC/AC converter) required for this is in the control electronics for the 
transmission oil pump. 



112 Control electronics for the transmission oil pump 


The following faults of the electrical transmission oil pump can be identified: 

• Line disconnections 

• Short circuit to ground 

• Internal short circuit 

• Faulty electric motor 


58 





112 Powertrain 
3. Automatic Transmission 


The electrical transmission oil pump is constantly in operation during electric driving. It is controlled as 
required depending on the transmission oil temperature and the driving speed. The EGS calculates the 
necessary power and requests this from the control electronics for the transmission oil pump. 

3.6.2. Transmission oil cooler 

The transmission oil cooler is designed as an oil-to-water heat exchanger and sits directly on the 
transmission housing below the intake noise damper. It is integrated in the low-temperature cooling 
circuit. In addition to the coolant and oil connections, it has a bypass valve. This bypass valve is open 
at cold transmission oil temperatures so that no coolant runs via the transmission oil cooler. An optimal 
operating temperature of the transmission oil is thus reached more quickly. The bypass valve closes at 
a transmission oil temperature of about 76 °C /168 °F. The coolant flows through the transmission oil 
cooler and can then absorb heat energy from the transmission oil. 

The bypass valve is controlled using a wax element, which is heated by the transmission oil, expands 
and closes the bypass valve. 


3.7. Notes for Service 

The following components of the automatic transmission are available as spare parts in addition to 
various retaining and sealing elements: 

• Drive position actuator 

• Drive position lever 

• Electronic transmission control (EGS) 

• Activation rod 

• Oil filler plug 

• Electrical wiring set 

• Gearbox input-speed sensor 

• Hydraulic shift unit 

• Cover (hydraulic shift unit) 

• Transmission oil cooler 

• Oil drain plug (with overflow) 

• Torque converter 

• Radial shaft seals for transmission input shaft, as well as left and right axle shaft 

When replacing the EGS an initialization of the selector lever position switch must be carried out.

The electric motor of the 112 sits in the front axle carrier and drives the front wheels. It includes the 
electrical machine, the Electrical Machine Electronics (EME), the 2-speed manual gearbox and the 
output shafts. There is no mechanical connection with the combustion engine.

112 Electrical machine 


The electrical machine in the 112 provides the necessary torque for the drive at the front axle. It can 
also charge the high-voltage battery with electrical energy through brake energy regeneration (energy 
recovery). 

The differences to the electrical machine in the 101 are minimal. The two variants only differ in 
the design of the housing (flange and assembly connection) and in their performance data. The 
mountings for the EKK and the anti-roll bar link are also deleted in the 112. The electrical machine in 
the 112 provides a peak performance of 96 kW (131 HP) and a torque of 250 Nm (184 lb ft). The inner 
structure, the operating principle and the cooling of the housing are identical. 

Several components and control units are involved in the drive control: 

• Digital Engine Electronics (DME), master control unit for the drive 

• Electrical machine electronics (EME) 

• Battery management electronics (SME) 

• Range Extender Electrical Machine Electronics (REME) 

• Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

The DME detects the driver's desired load via the accelerator pedal. As a result, it calculates, 
depending on the current driving mode, state of charge and temperature of the high-voltage battery 
and current driving situation, the corresponding drive torques and requests these from the drive units. 


61 



112 Powertrain 
4. Electric Motor 


The DSC continuously sends the wheel slip via the FlexRay to the DME and the EME. The DME 
includes this in the torque request. The EME can independently restrict the torque of the electrical 
machine in the case of unstable driving conditions. The deceleration request comes from the DSC for 
brake energy regeneration. The DME activates the electrical machine electronics accordingly. 

The electrical machine is able to drive the vehicle along or support the combustion engine (Boost 
function). 

The precise operating and energy recovery strategies are explained in detail in chapter 6 "Operating 
strategy".

The maximum power of 96 kW (130 hp) can only be made available for a maximum duration of 5 
s. Otherwise, the components of the electric motor would be damaged through overheating - this 
affects not only the electrical machine, but also the high-voltage battery and the electrical machine 
electronics. The maximum power applies for motorized mode. In alternator mode, however, only some 
of this maximum value is used in order not to overload the high-voltage battery and have a negative 
influence on the driving characteristics.

4.3.2. Function 

The GE2I12GK is an electromechanically actuated 2-speed manual gearbox. The driver can only 
influence the gear shift indirectly through the selection of the driving mode. The EME activates a gear 
selector actuator which engages the gears. The transmission does not have a clutch or parking lock 
function. The parking lock function is assumed by the automatic transmission.

To highlight the sporty character of the 112, first gear is engaged in Max eDrive mode. A gear shift is 
only effected upon activation or deactivation of the Max eDrive mode. 

The torque generated by the electrical machine reaches the transmission input shaft via the positive 
connection. From there the first or second gear is switched via a selector sleeve. The torque then 
reaches the differential via the respective gear set and an intermediate shaft. The differential 
distributes the torque to two outputs and enables the engine speed adjustment between the two drive 
gears.

PLCD sensor 

The position of the gearshift fork is captured by a PLCD sensor (Permanentmagnetic Linear 
Contactless Displacement). The PLCD sensor generally consists of a special core made from soft 
magnetic material. The entire length of the core is wrapped with a coil (primary coil) and has an 
evaluation coil at the ends.

Saturated area 


A permanent magnet at the gearshift fork results in local magnetic saturation and with it a virtual 
division of the core. 

When a suitable alternating current is applied to the primary coil, a voltage dependent on the position 
of the saturated area is induced in the evaluation coils. This enables the length of the virtual division of 
the core and thus the position of the saturated area to be determined. 

The supply of the sensor and the processing of the signals are effected by the EME. The AC voltage 
necessary for the primary coil is made available by the PLCD sensor.

112 Powertrain 

4. Electric Motor 


Gearshift 

The shifting of the two gears is assumed by the gear selector actuator. This consists of a 12 V direct 
current motor and a spindle gear. The spindle gear converts the circular movement of the engine into a 
linear movement and moves the gearshift fork. 

The gears are always shifted without a load. Before the gear shift the load of the electrical machine 
is withdrawn. After the gear is disengaged by the gear selector actuator, the speed of the electrical 
machine is adjusted to the gear being shifted. The speed adjustment and the activation of the 
electrical machine is effected by the EME. Then the gear selector actuator engages the new gear. 

Only after the PLCD sensor confirms the engaging of the gear and the speed of the electrical machine 
has been adapted by the EME, is the load of the electrical machine increased again. The driver can 
generally not notice the entire gear shift. In the event of a failure of the gear selector actuator or the 
EME, the gearshift fork remains in the current position. 

The gear selector actuator must be taught in using the diagnosis system, if: 

• the 2-speed manual gearbox has been replaced, 

• the electrical machine electronics has been replaced. 


Transmission oil 

A manual gearbox oil known from BMW vehicles is used as a transmission oil (Castrol BOT 338). The 
transmission housing made from die-cast aluminum is also used as an oil sump and holds the full 
capacity of about 0.65 I transmission oil. The spur gear of the intermediate shaft and the differential 
run in the transmission oil and ensure the entire transmission is lubricated (oil sump lubrication). The 
transmission oil is designed for the operating life of the 112 meaning there is no need for a replacement 
of the transmission oil.

The 2-speed manual gearbox is secured at three places. On the electrical machine and on the other 
via two engine support arms. The upper engine support arm supports the 2-speed manual gearbox by 
a bearing at the front axle carrier. Using the lower engine support arm the transmission is connected 
to the front axle carrier. This design allows the deletion of the anti-roll bar link known from the 101. The 
upper and lower engine support arms are each screwed on at the transmission housing using three 
screws. The housing of the 2-speed manual gearbox also serves as a fixture for the EKK and the gear 
selector actuator.

The torque is transmitted by a positive connection from the drive shaft of the electrical machine to the 
transmission input shaft. For this purpose, both shafts have gearing. 

A__ _ 

When joining the transmission and the electrical machine the procedure described in the repair 
instructions must be followed. Ensure axial alignment of the transmission input shaft and output shaft 
to avoid distortion during assembly. In addition, the two gearings must be greased before joining. Do 
not exceed the specified quantity of grease! 


There is a sealing ring at the joining connection between housings of the electrical machine and the 
transmission, whose cross-section is shaped like the letter "X". This X-sealing ring and the O-sealing 
ring on the transmission input shaft must be wet with the oil before joining. 

The transmission is not integrated in the cooling system of the electric motor and therefore has no 
connections for coolant lines. Sufficient heat is discharged via the air flowing by at the transmission 
housing and the connection for the electrical machine. Due to temperature fluctuations, excess 
pressure and a vacuum would occur in a completely sealed housing. To avoid this, there is a vent in the 
area of the intermediate shaft. The vent has a cap to protect against contamination.

The goal of the operating strategy is to guarantee a high degree of efficiency and driving dynamics of 
the vehicle. It enables intelligent and innovative interaction of the drive components and makes the 112 
diverse. This diversity is also seen in the driving modes, with which the driver can always have a direct 
influence on the operating strategy and thus the drivability of the 112. The driving modes are divided 
into: 


• COMFORT 

• ECO PRO 

• SPORT 

In COMFORT mode the driver's torque requirement for example is divided between the electrical 
machine and the combustion engine depending on the situation, so that the vehicle is always driven 
at maximum efficiency. Upon request the driver can drive using pure electric means (Max eDrive). 

In contrast, in SPORT mode the full system power is available and the electric motor supports the 
combustion engine with the Boost function. 

The driving modes thus have a direct influence on different performance features: 

• Selection of the driven axle 

• System power 

• Driving dynamics 

• Range 

• Load point increase 

• Boost function 

• Energy recovery

COMFORT mode is the standard mode. It is activated each time the vehicle is started and can be 
selected using the driving experience switch.

Explanation

Driving experience switch 


Depending on the position of the accelerator pedal, a situation-dependent torque distribution is 
effected between the electric motor and the combustion engine with regard to efficiency, traction, 
energy recovery and dynamics. When the high-voltage battery is fully charged up to a speed of about 
90 km/h (55 mph) the electric motor is mainly used and the high-voltage battery is discharged. This 
driving condition is also called Auto eDrive and is used in urban environments. The combustion engine 
is then switched off. Through energy recovery by the front electrical machine, e.g. when approaching a 
red light, traffic, electrical energy is fed to the high-voltage battery and stored there.

The combustion engine is only switched on automatically in the case of an increase in the driver's 
desired load. 

Outside the urban environment the combustion engine is used more frequently than the electric motor 
and the high-voltage battery is charged at the same time. The state of charge is then maintained in 
a certain range in order to be able to provide sufficient electrical energy for the Boost function. The 
deceleration which occurs during energy recovery is approximately at the level of the normal engine 
drag torque for conventional vehicles.

• High load requirement (large accelerator pedal angle) 

• Very low state of charge 

• Kickdown 

The combustion engine is switched off in the following situations: 

• Operation of the brake pedal and driving speeds below 75 km/h (46 mph) 

• Vehicle standstill (automatic engine start-stop function)

6.3.2. ECO PRO mode 

The driver of a 112 can drive his vehicle even more efficiently upon request. The ECO PRO mode 
consistently supports a driving style at reduced consumption levels and ensures coordination of the 
hybrid drive for achieving maximum range of the vehicle. ECO PRO mode is activated using the driving 
experience switch. Essentially the following measures help to increase the range: 

• A modified accelerator pedal characteristic curve and shift program with automatic 
transmission helps the driver adopt a driving style that optimizes fuel consumption. 

• In order to use the Boost function a larger accelerator pedal angle is necessary (due to the 
modified accelerator pedal characteristic curve). 

• Power reduction of the electrical comfort consumers (e.g. mirror heating). 

• Power reduction of heating/air-conditioning system.

Reduction of electrical comfort consumers 

In ECO PRO mode a certain measure of reduction in comfort is tolerated. Under certain conditions the 
power of the following comfort consumers can be reduced: 

• Mirror heating 

• Heated seats 

• Heated rear window 


Power reduction of heating/air-conditioning system 

For the climate control an operating strategy with lower energy consumption at acceptable comfort 
restrictions are used. The air-conditioning works in a more efficient manner with reduced drying of air 
and less air cooling. Less electrical energy is used. 

The cooling of the high-voltage battery always has top priority and is not affected by the activation of 
ECO PRO mode. 

If the required temperatures can be achieved without the air conditioner compressor, the electric A/C 
compressor is switched off.

6.3.3. SPORT mode 

In SPORT mode the 112 can develop its full system power of 266 kW (362 HP). The driver must move 
the gear selector switch to the left. Manual shifting of the gears in the automatic transmission is also 
possible. In SPORT mode the combustion engine is always active. The automatic engine start-stop 
function is deactivated. 

The electrical machine is used in SPORT mode for the Boost function. In this driving mode purely 
electric driving is not possible. The high-voltage battery can be actively charged via the high-voltage 
starter motor generator so that there is always sufficient energy available for the Boost function. The 
state of charge is thus maintained at a higher level than is the case for other driving modes.

The energy recovery and Boost power (electrical machine and high-voltage starter motor generator) 
are at their maximum in this driving mode. 

If in SPORT mode the state of charge of the high-voltage battery drops too much as a result of a 
driving situation with few energy recovery phases and the high-voltage starter motor generator no 
longer delivers sufficient electrical energy, the front electrical machine is activated in order to generate 
electrical energy. This situation occurs for example during a long uphill journey, which is handled in 
SPORT mode. Some of the drive generated by the combustion engine is used directly in order to 
charge the high-voltage battery during driving via the front axle. 

In this situation the deceleration which occurs at the front axle by the energy recovery of the electrical 
machine is accepted in order to avoid a significant drop in the state of charge.

6.3.4. Max eDrive mode 

Upon request the driver can drive using purely electrical means up to 120 km/h (75 mph) using Max 
eDrive mode. The range is about 37 km (23 miles). For the activation the eDrive button below the start/ 
stop button must be pressed. Max eDrive mode can be activated in COMFORT and ECO PRO mode in 
order to prevent the combustion engine starting up.

2 Energy recovery 


With a kickdown the combustion engine is switched on and deactivates the Max eDrive mode. In the 
process COMFORT mode is automatically activated. 

The electrical range that can be attained is heavily dependent on the driving style (acceleration and 
speed) and the ambient temperature - and the secondary consumers. In order to reach a maximum 
electrical range, a preheating/precooling of the passenger compartment should be carried out during 
external charging. The energy which would be required for this during the journey can then be used for 
a higher electrical range. 

If the vehicle is started in Max eDrive mode after a long stationary off period and very cold ambient 
temperatures, it may cause a power reduction of the electric motor. A reason for this may be an 
excessively low cell temperature in the cell modules of the high-voltage battery unit. 


86 








112 Powertrain 
6. Operating Strategy 

6.4. Drive control 

Depending on the position of the accelerator pedal and the speed at which it is pressed, the DME 
calculates the desired drive torque. The drive torque is thus always distributed variably to the individual 
axles depending on the situation, so that there is always an optimal balance between dynamics, driving 
safety, traction and efficiency. The DME is the master control unit for the drive control. 

With a low accelerator pedal angle the electric motor is used for driving off (except in SPORT mode). 

If a higher drive torque is requested via the accelerator pedal, the combustion engine is switched on 
and provides the drive. If the combustion engine is switched on, the front axle assumes the drive part, 
should this be required for example due to traction reasons or by the Boost function. The front and rear 
transmissions distribute drive torque to the same components on both sides. 



112 Example of longitudinal distribution of the drive torque

Explanation 

1 

Drive torque distributed by the DME

Drive torque available at the wheel 


The intelligent torque distribution of the axle hybrid also results in typical all-wheel drive behavior. Up 
to 100% variable torque distribution between the front and rear axle can actively influence the self¬ 
steering response and the driving dynamics. The axle hybrid enables a neutral and safe drivability 
up to the limit range. Upon initial instability, e.g. understeering, the drive torque is also distributed 
between the front and rear axle, this prevents sliding by the front axle. The drive torque at the front axle 
is reduced and the drive torque at the rear axle increased. 

This is clarified using the example of driving around a sharp bend in which the front axle is also driven 
by the Boost function when entering the bend.

Drive torque at the rear axle 

2 

Drive torque at the front axle 


The optimal traction can also be achieved in bends, whereby quicker acceleration from the bend is 
possible. 

If the driving stability reaches the limit ranges, it may naturally bring about a DSC intervention. 
However, the DSC intervention is carried out more rarely, whereby the ride comfort is noticeably 
improved. 

The DSC plays a role not only in the dynamic handling characteristics of limit ranges, but also supplies 
the maximum transferable torque to the DME at any time. Both during acceleration and energy 
recovery. These torque specifications are processed in the DME and always considered in the drive 
torque distribution. For example, the Boost or energy recovery power of the front electrical machine 
is always adapted to the driving situation and reduced if necessary. In contrast, the negative torque 
from the energy recovery can also be specifically used to intervene for driving stability. In this way the 
different drive systems are constantly working on a common objective and complement each other. 

Kickdown 

The kickdown is a special position within the drive control. Kickdown means that all drive sources are 
activated to enable the maximum drive. These include: 

• Combustion engine 

• Electrical machine 

• High-voltage starter motor generator 


88 








112 Powertrain 
6. Operating Strategy 

6.4.1. Boost function 

In the 112 the front electrical machine and the high-voltage starter motor generator can be used to 
support the combustion engine. The function is called the Boost function. This process differs from 
the previous hybrid cars by the fact that the support of the combustion engine is provided individually 
and independently for the respective axle. 



112 Boost function 


Index 

Explanation

Drive torque at the rear axle

The support of the combustion engine and thus the rear axle is carried out in COMFORT, ECO PRO 
and SPORT modes. In COMFORT and in ECO PRO modes only in the lower engine speed range 
of the combustion engine is the high-voltage starter motor generator used as a support (with 
corresponding torque requirement via the accelerator pedal). 

The kickdown is an exception. In this case the full power of the high-voltage starter motor generator is 
provided over the entire engine speed range (Overboost). In order to be able to request the full system 
power of the 112 in SPORT mode, the full power of the high-voltage starter motor generator is available 
in this driving mode from the beginning. 


89 





112 Powertrain 

6. Operating Strategy 

The level of additional acceleration generally depends on: 

• State of charge (SOC) of high-voltage battery 

• Driving mode selected 

• Temperature of the respective components 

• Torque that can be transmitted between wheel and road 

• Driving speed 

At a very low state of charge of the high-voltage battery, the Boost power is reduced in a linear fashion 
independent of the driving mode selected. 

6.4.2. Load point increase 

Raising the load of the combustion engine at consistent engine speed is called load point increase. 
This results in an increase in performance and the option to operate the combustion engine in the 
optimal range. 

The arising resistance, which counteracts the combustion engine, must be compensated so that on 
the one hand the load of the engine increases, and on the other hand the speed remains constant. An 
example here is switching on the heating and air-conditioning system or the heated rear window. The 
compensation of the additional resistance is assumed by the DME. The DME supplies the combustion 
engine with more fresh air by activating the throttle valve. The injected fuel quantity is also increased. 
The load of the combustion engine increases and is in a more optimal range in terms of efficiency and 
fuel consumption. However, this control happens so precisely that there is no engine speed increase, 
but only the occurring resistance is compensated. 

In the 112 the high-voltage starter motor generator in alternator mode generates a counter-torque in 
the belt drive. As described above, the DME compensates this counter-torque and the combustion 
engine is operated more optimally. The electrical energy gained is used to charge the high-voltage 
battery. In this way the combustion engine is also positively influenced during charging of the high- 
voltage battery. 

The B38 Top engine in the 112 is not operated at anytime as a range extender, unlike the W20 engine 
in the 101. The combustion engine only runs when drive torque should be transferred to the rear axle. 
The load point increase happens in addition to the already existing power requirement. This process is 
unnoticeable to the driver. 

Factors which are decisive over time and level of the load point increase: 

• State of charge of the high-voltage battery 

• Drive mode 

• Load of the combustion engine 

• Temperature of the combustion engine

112 Powertrain

6.4.3. Energy recovery 

In the 112 brake energy regeneration (energy recovery) takes place both via the front and rear 
axle. Power ratings up to 50 kW can be recovered via the electrical machine at the front axle. The 
braking power which can be generated at the rear axle via the high-voltage starter motor generator is 
considerably lower. This means that the wear of the brake discs and brake pads will be extremely low, 
providing a forward-thinking driving style is adopted. 



112 Energy recovery

Explanation 

1 

Deceleration torque at the rear axle

Deceleration torque at the front axle 


The energy recovery generally functions in coasting (overrun) mode similar for BMW hybrid cars. If the 
DME detects an accelerator pedal angle of 0°, the electrical machine electronics (EME) and the range 
extender electrical machine electronics (REME) are requested to start energy recovery in coasting 
mode by activating the electrical machines accordingly. In this way the electrical energy is generated 
and stored in the high-voltage battery. 

A special feature in the 112 is the different strengths of energy recovery in coasting mode. It is primarily 
dependent on the respective driving mode and the state of charge of the high-voltage battery. The 
maximum deceleration is achieved in SPORT driving mode, while it is lower in COMFORT, ECO PRO 
and Max eDrive modes (slightly above the level when it causes the engine drag torque in conventional 
vehicles). 


91 






112 Powertrain 
6. Operating Strategy 

If the driver has a stronger deceleration request and presses the brake pedal, the DSC control unit 
detects the level of the desired deceleration by the brake pedal travel sensor and transfers the 
information to the DME. The DME calculates the power requirement for the electrical machine and 
the high-voltage starter motor generator corresponding to the deceleration request and activates a 
stronger energy recovery by the EME and the REME. The wheel brakes are not operated until the 
maximum energy recovery is reached. Only for a higher deceleration request, is the service brake also 
used. If the recuperative braking system is omitted, for example by emergency braking, a fault in the 
high-voltage system or a fully charged high-voltage battery, the necessary brake force is only made 
available by the service brake. The driver does not notice this change at the brake pedal. 

Parallel to this, the DSC control unit also permanently monitors the driving situation during energy 
recovery and intervenes where necessary. Before an unstable driving situation occurs during energy 
recovery, the DME is requested by the DSC control unit to reduce the negative torque at the respective 
axle. If this is not sufficient to re-establish a stable driving situation, the energy recovery is completely 
adjusted and a DSC intervention via the brake occurs. 


6.5. Driving and energy recovery strategy 

The main objective of the driving and energy recovery strategy is the provision of a sufficiently high 
state of charge of the high-voltage battery over the entire driving time. "Sufficient" means providing 
enough electrical energy for the electric motor. Only this way is the maximum system power of the 
vehicle during driving guaranteed. Electrical energy is generated via: 

• Energy recovery (electrical machine and high-voltage starter motor generator) 

• Load point increase of the combustion engine (high-voltage starter motor generator) 

It is not the objective of the driving and energy recovery strategy to increase the state of charge of the 
high-voltage battery to 100% during driving. This is what external charging is used for. In the case of a 
high state of charge (SoC), the energy is used by the high-voltage battery to keep the electrical part of 
driving as high as possible or to drive purely using electrical means. 

With a reducing state of charge the proportion of electrical driving also reduces so that the combustion 
engine, irrespective of the pedal sensor position or the speed driven, is often switched on in order 
to take over the drive and charge the high-voltage battery. This range serves to maintain the state of 
charge. If the state of charge continues to fall, e.g. by more frequent use of the Boost function, there 
is a reduction of the electrically driven speed from 60 km/h to 50 km/h (37 mph to 31 mph) and an 
acceleration of the electric motor. This reduction sets in depending on the driving style at a state of 
charge of about 25%. 

Shortly before reaching a critical value the energy for electric driving and the Boost function is 
withdrawn in a linear fashion. The automatic engine start-stop function is also deactivated so that the 
combustion engine can also charge the high-voltage battery at a standstill.

The threshold value from which the state of charge is maintained depends on several factors: 


• Activation of SPORT mode 

• Setting for maintaining the state of charge 

• Active route guidance of the navigation system 

As described in SPORT mode, the high-voltage battery is actively charged in order to be able to 
provide sufficient electrical energy for the Boost function. The threshold value for maintaining the state 
of charge of the high-voltage battery is therefore higher. 


93 














112 Powertrain 
6. Operating Strategy 

Maintain state of charge 

Should it become necessary, for example to use the stored electrical energy at a later stage of the 
journey, a corresponding selection can be made via Drive under the menu item "Settings" and "Auto 
eDrive". The current state of charge of the high-voltage battery and the electrical range are displayed 
in the menu. The prerequisites for the selection of the "Maintain state of charge" function are: 

• COMFORT or ECO PRO modes are deactivated 

• State of charge is higher than about 10 % 



Upon activation of the function the combustion engine switches on more frequently in order to be 
able to maintain the state of charge of the high-voltage battery via the high-voltage starter motor 
generator. An activation is already possible with a fully charged high-voltage battery. However, the 
state of charge is reduced minimally in order to be able to absorb electrical energy during energy 
recovery, for example. 


Depending on the driving style the state of charge can be maintained at the current level. With the 
"Maintain state of charge" function it is not possible to increase the state of charge at the time of 
activation. The following events lead to the deactivation of the "Maintain state of charge" function: 


• Deactivation via Drive 

• Activation of SPORT or Max eDrive mode 

• Terminal change 


While the "Maintain state of charge" function is activated, the automatic engine start-stop function is 
available. If the current level of the state of charge equals the level to be maintained, the combustion 
engine is shut down at a vehicle standstill. If the current level of the state of charge is below the level to 
be maintained, the combustion engine is not shut down during a vehicle standstill. 

Route guidance of the navigation system 

With active route guidance by the navigation system the route is analyzed and the operating strategy 
adapted to the topography. The navigation data of the individual distances permit a calculation of the 
power required to cover the distances. Based on these power forecasts and the state of charge of the 
high-voltage battery, a decision is made on whether the combustion engine or the electric motor is 
used for this distance. The aim is to increase the electrical energy for the destination zone and the 
urban environment. There are three situations which reacts proactively to the operating strategy: 


94 



112 Powertrain 
6. Operating Strategy 


Low speed zone 

An attempt is made to guarantee electric driving in a low speed zone. If necessary, the high- 
voltage battery must be actively charged beforehand. 

Downhill gradients 

With a fully charged high-voltage battery and oncoming downhill gradients, there is a 
reduction of the state of charge in order to be able to use the entire electrical energy from 
the energy recovery during the downhill gradient. Reduction of the state of charge is effected 
before the downhill gradient by the high-voltage starter motor generator, where it supports the 
combustion engine (Boost function). 

Destination zone 

An attempt is made to guarantee electric driving before reaching the destination and at the 
destination. If necessary, the high-voltage battery must be actively charged beforehand.
