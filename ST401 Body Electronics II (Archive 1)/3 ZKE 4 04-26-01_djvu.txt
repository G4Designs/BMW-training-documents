The ZKE IV system was introduced on the E36 Convertible and is also used in the Z3. Most 
of the functions operate the same on these vehicles with minor changes and added fea¬ 
tures to the system. ZKE IV is the fourth generation of central body control systems. 

The GM IV is responsible for controlling most of the Body Electronic Functions from one 
central module.

System Components 


General Module (GM IV): The GM is a micro¬ 
computer that is the central component (heart) 
of the Central Body Electronics. The GM is loc¬ 
ated behind the glove box. 

The main objectives for using the GM are: 

• Increase Overall Reliability 

• Centralize Electronic Systems 

• Decrease Assembly and Service Repairs 

• Centralized Diagnosis of all ZKE Components 

• Individualization of Features (Coding) 



The GM requires input data to perform Central 
Body Electronics functions. The inputs are sup¬ 
plied by digital switched signals such as: 

• Driver’s Door Lock Microswitch: supplies vol¬ 
tage (KL 30) to the GM when switched. A 
path to ground is provided by the GM (inter¬ 
nally). The GM monitors the input voltage. 

• Central Lock Button (E36 from 96 MY): sup¬ 
plies a ground circuit to the GM when switc¬ 
hed. The GM supplies and monitors a refer¬ 
ence voltage (5v) that is “pulled” low when the 
switched ground path is provided. 



The GM processes the input information and 
contains “coded” instructions that allow a spe¬ 
cific output control of functions. 

The GM will produce output controls using int¬ 
ernal transistors to switch relays allowing cur¬ 
rent flow (providing voltage or ground) through 
circuits and actuators. Actuators ( such as 
relays and motors) are used by the GM to oper¬ 
ate or control various output functions.

Windshield Wiping/Washing 

Purpose of the System 

The windshield wiping/washing functions are controlled by a separate wiper module 
(WWM). The system has never been directly controlled by the ZKE, even though it is a body 
electrical system. 

The system has four wiping stages including one interval wip¬ 
ing speed when the ignition is in position KL R or KL15. The 
wiper motor output control is by the WWM located behind the 
glovebox. 

System Components E36 Wiper stalk 

- with Principle of Operation 

Wiper Stalk Switch Input 

The wiping stage inputs are through a coded combination switch that supplies a ground 
signal to the WWM. The wiping stages include: 

Single (S): Momentarily holding the wiper switch down in the single position provides a 
momentary ground signal to activate a single sweep in slow speed. 

Slow (I) and Fast (II): The stage I and stage II wiping speeds are road speed dependent. 
Stage I switches to intermittent when the vehicle is stopped and stage II switches to stage 
I when stopped. 

Windshield Washing: The wash request provides a switched ground input to the WWM 
by pulling the stalk rearward. The WWM activates the windshield washer pump directly. 
When the washing function is activated, the pump runs as long as the switch is held. The 
wipers switch on and will continue to for 3 wiping cycles after the switch is released. 

Intermittent: The interval time of the wipers is vehicle speed dependent. As the vehicle 
speed increases, wiping interval times decrease. This timed interval is set in the control 
module and is not programmable. The programmed intermittent cycles are as follows: 



0-10 mph 

10-25 mph 

25-50 mph 

50-69 mph 

69-93 mph 

>93 mph

Blocking Protection 


The wiper module receives a feedback signal from the wiper motor when the wipers are 
switched on. If this feedback signal is missing for several seconds after the wipers are 
switched on, the module will switch the motor off. 

The wiper switch must be moved to the off position before another attempt can be made 
to turn the wipers on. If this blocking protection has activated several times, the ignition 
must be cycled before the wipers can be switched on again. 

The wiper module is not connected to the diagnostic link for troubleshooting purposes. 
Standard troubleshooting procedures using an ETM and DISplus multimeter must be 
employed to diagnose the wiper/washer.

318ti Rear Window Wiper/Washer 


The rear glass of the 318ti has a wiper/washer. This system has an additional set of con¬ 
tacts in the wiper stalk switch that operates the rear window system as well as front win¬ 
dow wiper/washer system. Operation is as follows: 


• Intermittent Wiping: Push the wiper switch away from the steering wheel briefly to acti¬ 
vate intermittent wipe. Pressing a second time will switch the wiping off. 


• Wash/Wipe: Push the lever away from the steering wheel and hold, this will activate the

Central Locking 

Purpose of the System 

The Central Locking System provides locking/ 
unlocking of the entire vehicle from one central 
exterior point. 

From the driver’s door, passenger’s door or lug¬ 
gage compartment (>96 MY), a lock/unlock 
request will lock/unlock all exterior doors, lug¬ 
gage compartment and the fuel filler flap (and 
glove box E36iC only). 

Locking from the luggage compartment lock 
cylinder and leaving the lock cylinder in the hori¬ 
zontal position will manually lock the luggage 
compartment in the “valet” position. 

From inside, the vehicle can be locked using one of the front 
door lock knobs or a central locking button (>96 MY E36 
which also unlocks the vehicle) located in the center console. 

The doors can be unlocked by pulling twice on the interior door 
handle. 

Locking the vehicle from the central switch or door lock knob 
will “single lock” all doors, luggage compartment and not lock 
the fuel filler flap (or glovebox on the E36iC). 

The Central Locking System utilizes the GM IV to carry out all of the locking/unlocking fea¬ 
tures: 

• When locked from the outside, the vehicle will double lock and arm the alarm system (only 
if equipped with DWA, not the accessory Alpine Alarm). The ignition must be switched 
off and the driver’s door must be opened and closed. 

• The EWS II is interfaced for double lock monitoring and unlock functional/95 Production 
Date). With the presence of an accepted EWS II key and switching the ignition “on”, the 
GM IV will unlock the vehicle. 

• In the event of an accident (ignition must be switched on), the GM IV will be signalled to 
unlock all of the doors. 

Central Body Electronics ZKE 




< CD 



• Anti-theft drive away protection feature with double lock (>1/95 Production Date when 
locking the vehicle from the exterior). 

• Comfort closing of the windows is posible from both front door locks if held in the lock 
position. 

• 1996 E36 - Sunroof added to comfort closing feature. 

• E36iC - The trunk is locked out when the convertible top is in operation. Fully automatic 
convertible top added to comfort closing feature (97 MY and later vehicles). 


Hardware Features 


• The door lock buttons are mechanically uncoupled from the 
lock actuators when locked. The door lock buttons also 
“mechanically” lock the individual doors. This provides man¬ 
ual locking in the event of a central locking malfunction. 

• Child safety locks (located in the rear doors on a four door 
vehicle) are actuated by sliding a lever. The door can now 
only be opened from outside. 



• The luggage compartment can be manually locked with a 
“Master Key” and leaving the lock cylinder in the horizontal 
position which prevents opening by any other method (sec¬ 
ured for valet). 

• The Fuel Filler Flap mechanical release is found in the right 
side of the luggage compartment. 


• The glove box has a lock cylinder to secure the contents by 
manual locking with a “Master Key” and leaving the lock cyl¬ 
inder in the horizontal position which prevents opening by 
any other method (secured for valet). 


The valet key is not mechanically capable of entering either of 
these lock cylinders.

Central Body Electronics ZKE IV 





Central Locking - ZKE IV 


The locking and unlocking of the lock actuators is controlled from three relays in the GM. 
The door lock actuator “Pin Contacts” and lock micro-switches provide the inputs to the 
GM for locking/double locking and unlocking of the doors, trunk, fuel filler flap (and glove 
box on the E36iC only). The relays in the GM provide both power and ground depending 
on the direction of actuator movement (lock/unlock).

Lock Actuator Operation 

The lock actuators contain the electrical motor drive, the lock/ 
unlock switch contacts and the integral single/double lock lim¬ 
iting switch. 

The actuators control the mechanical locking/unlocking func¬ 
tion of the doors by sliding two protruding levers. The precise 
positioning of the levers provides the unlock, single lock and 
double lock positions of the latch mechanism. 

The electro-mechanical operation of all the lock positions are 
provided on the following pages:

Central Locking System Terminology 

“Single lock”, “Central lock”: Vehicle is locked via the lock knob, or the console mounted 
central lock button (>12-95 prod). 

“Double lock”, “Central arrest”: Vehicle has been locked from the exterior with the key at 
the driver’s door, passenger’s door or trunk.

• The lock button and key mechanically rotate the lock lever which decouples the exterior 
door handle from the latch. 

• When rotated, the lock lever also slides an internal switch ramp to the left closing the lock 
microswitch. 

• This provides the lock signal to the GM (cont’d on next page.) 


13 

Central Body Electronics ZKE IV 



SINGLE LOCK - Phase 2, activation of actuators at all door locks 


When the GM receives the lock signal it activates internal relay #1, providing power through 
the closed single lock contact to the actuator motor. Ground is provided through the mod¬ 
ule’s closed contact of relay #3. 


All of the vehicle’s actuator motors are energized until the single lock circuit is opened by 
the gear driven slider. The actuators stop at the single locked position. 


At this point, the external door handles are decoupled from the latch mechanism prevent¬ 
ing entry from outside of the vehicle.

DOUBLE LOCK - Electrical Activation 


Turning the key from any outside lock cylinder causes the external double lock micro-switch 
to close. The GM recognizes this high signal as a double lock request. 


The GM activates internal relay #2, providing continued motor operating power through the 
closed contacts of the internal double lock circuit. Ground is provided through the GM’s 
internal relay # 3. The actuator motors are energized until the internal double lock circuit is 
switched back to the single lock circuit by the gear driven slider.

DOUBLE LOCK - Mechanically Decoupled 


When the slider switches the circuit back to single lock it also pushes the double lock lever 
to the left until it stops. In this position, the double lock lever decouples the lock button from 
the latch mechanism. The lock button can be pulled but will not unlock the door since it is 
not coupled to the mechanism. Spring pressure pulls the button back down when released. 


At this point, unlock is only possible when a key is turned to the unlock position from an outside 
door lock or if the GM receives the unlock signal from the EWS II control module.

UNLOCK FROM DOUBLE LOCK 

When the GM receives the unlock request from a key location it activates internal relay #3 
providing operating power to the actuator motor in the opposite direction. 

The single and double lock circuits (internal relays 1 & 2) are not activated at all during the 
unlock function providing ground for the motor to bring the actuator back to the fully un¬ 
locked position.

Locking Protection 

Power protection for the door locking circuit is provided by a “time monitored” activation of 
the door lock actuators by the GM. The door lock actuators are provided power for the 
duration of time needed to run the actuator to the desired position. 

• The maximum on time for the actuators is 0.7 seconds. 



Crash Signalling 

The Supplemental Restraint System control module provides a switched signal to the GM 
in the event of an accident. This signal was previously provided by the Crash Alarm locat¬ 
ed in the left front kick panel on earlier models (<97 MY). 

The signal is an output function of the control module and becomes active when the impact 
threshold has been exceeded. The GM unlocks the vehicle, switches on the interior lights 
and signals the Crash Alarm Relay to flash the exterior lights when this signal is active.

Door Lock Heating (optional) 

Purpose of the System 

The Driver’s door lock cylinder is surrounded by a heating coil to warm the lock cylinder if 
in case it is frozen due to moisture and below freezing temperatures. 

Principle of Operation 

The GM controls the lock heater by providing voltage through a final stage transistor. The 
heater is switched on by raising the driver’s door handle. Prerequisites for heater operation 
include: 


• Vehicle locked 

• Door handle raised for approximately 3 seconds 


Power is applied to the heater for a maximum of 32 seconds. A timed arrest of 16 minutes 
is activated after 3 heating attempts. The door lock heater is switched off immediately after 
unlocking the door.

Power Windows/Sunroof 


Purpose of the System 

The features of the power windows and sunroof system include: 

• One-touch operation in both directions (up/ 
down) on the front windows, down only on 
the rear windows. 

• Anti-trap detection is on the front windows 
only (initialization required for one touch oper¬ 
ation). 

• The control of the rear windows is carried out 
through a Relay Module (RM IV). 


• The switches in the center console controls 
all four windows and the rear window lock 
out feature. 

Principle of Operation 

All window operation request signals are digital inputs to the GM. 

• Comfort Closing of the windows from the driver’s or passenger’s lock cylinder when held 
in the locking position. 

• When the ignition key is in accessory or “ON” press the switch to open or close the win¬ 
dows. Window operation is possible with the ignition switched off until a front door is 
opened or 16 minutes (maximum) has elapsed. 

• Power protection against a jammed or seized motor is monitored by the hall sensors in 
the window motors. The GM will interrupt the power to a jammed motor. Rear windows 
utilize current sensing for shut off. 

• The one-touch function is activated by momentarily pressing the window switch to the 
second detent. Window travel will cease when the full up or down position has been rea¬ 
ched. One-touch can be canceled by pressing the window switch a second time. Anti¬ 
trap is provided by the GM monitoring the door glass movement from the hall sensor. If 
the door glass encounters resistance in the closing direction (>100Nm) the motor 

will stop and reverse direction for 50 mm of travel. 



20 

Central Body Electronics ZKE IV 




Window Operation specific to the E36 Convertible: 

• Central Window Switch: Located in the center console, the switch will raise or lower all 
four windows at the same time. The window lowering has the one-touch feature. 

• Convertible top operation: Prior to lowering 
the top, the top control module signals the 
GM to lower all four windows half way. 

- If the top switch is held after the top is fully 
lowered, the windows will close fully. 

- If the top switch is held after the top is fully 
closed the GM will close the windows. 

• With the introduction of the fully automatic 
convertible top, the comfort close feature of 
the convertible was also added. 



Window Operation specific to the Coupe, Convertible and Z3 Coupe: 

The design of the E36 Coupe, Convertible and Z3 Coupe required changes in the window 
operation. 

• When opening the door, the door glass is automatically lowered by approximately 10mm. 
When the door latch opens (switch closes), the window will drop. It remains down until 
the door contact switch opens when the door is closed. The window will then raise back 
into the door seal. 

• When the door is closed, the glass is raised 
back into the seal. 

This allows the glass to drop out of the door 
seal when opening the door and provides a 
tighter seal when the door and glass are 
closed. 


• The window motor contains a Hall sensor for 
this feature that is monitored by the GM. 



21 

Central Body Electronics ZKE IV 





System Components 

Window Switches: The signals from the window switches 
are monitored by the GM. 

The power window switches have a second detent position 
for the purpose of signalling the one touch feature. 


CLOSE OPEN 


LIGHTING 



Relay Module: The RM IV was added for rear window oper¬ 
ation in the 4 door and convertible models only. 

Similar to the front window relays in the GM, the Relay Module 
contains the relays for the rear window motors on these vehi¬ 
cles. 

The RM IV is located behind the glove box in the electrical car¬ 
rier next to the GM.

Initialization of Window Circuits 


Initialization of the window circuits is required for the one-touch and anti-trap features to 
function. Closing the window and holding the switch for an additional two seconds will ini¬ 
tialize the system. However the window drive motor switches off automatically after the 
motor ceases rotation for approximately 0.3 seconds. 


Sunroof 


Purpose of the System 


When the ignition key is in the accessory or “on” 
position press the switch to lift (1), close the sun¬ 
roof (2) or open the sunroof (3). 

When lifting, the headliner retracts several inch¬ 
es. The sunroof can continue to operate after the 
ignition has been switched off (up to 16 minutes) 
as long as one of the front doors has not been 
opened. 

E36 vehicles are equipped with the steel roof 
while the Z3 Coupe is equipped with the glass 
(moon) roof. Mechanically, the sunroofs are sim¬ 
ilar in design. 



Principle of Operation 

The motor incorporates a sunroof module (>96 MY) which receives inputs from the sunroof 

switch (1) for operation. This sunroof system has the one touch open function. 

The sunroof module is linked to the GM for two purposes: 

• The comfort closing feature when the key is held in the lock 
position in one of the door lock cylinders. 

• Unloader signal. This signal (30h) informs the sunroof motor 
module to stop running the sunroof motor when the GM 
receives a start signal (KL 50).

Interior Lighting 


Purpose of the System 

The GM controls the interior lighting automatically with the 
status change of several monitored inputs. 

The lighting can also be manually controlled using the interior 
light switch (2). 

In addition to the various time controls, the interior lights are 
also subject to the 16 minute shut down of the GM (con¬ 
sumer protection). 

Principle of Operation 

The interior light switch is a rocker switch that will activate the interior lights “On or Off” 
(left/right positions). When the light switch is in the center position (automatic): 

• If the interior lights are switched “ON” by the button with the ignition switched ON, the 
interior lights will remain on until they are switched off by the button. 

• If the interior lights are switched “ON” when the ignition is switched OFF, the lights will 
remain on for 16 minutes (consumer cutout). 

• Locking the vehicle from the outside will immediately switch off the interior lights. 

The ON/OFF conditions for the interior lights in the automatic mode are as follows: 

ON Conditions 

• Door Open. 

• Switching off ignition after exterior 
lights have been switched off. 

• Crash Alarm/MRS input.

OFF Conditions 

• All doors closed with ignition on. 

• All doors closed with ignition off after 20 
seconds. 

• 20 seconds after switching off ignition with 
lights off. 

• 8 seconds after switching the ignition off. 

• 16 minutes with door(s) open. 

• When doors are locked.

LIGHTS 


• The GM in 3 Series convertibles 
provide power to the manual 
circuit of the interior lights (See 
the Consumer Cutout feature). 

• Through the production range 
there are minor changes in the 
lighting fixtures. 

For example: the additional map 
light switch on rear seat interior 
lights on 1997 models. Always 
refer to the specific ETM for the 
vehicle being serviced.

General Functions of ZKE IV 


Consumer Cut Off 


The Consumer Cut Off function interrupts battery voltage to circuits preventing inadvertent 
battery drain if one of the consumers were to remain activated. The GM will deactivate the 
interior lights after 16 minutes if one of the doors is left open. Convertibles also have the 
following lighting circuits controlled by this feature: 

• Glove Box Light 

• Trunk Light 


The circuit will switch back on when any monitored wake up trigger such as the door con¬ 
tacts or the lock/unlock signals become active. 

Overload Protection 

The Central Locking circuit of the GM is protected against overloads and short circuits by 
the electronic Overload Protection which is an integral part of the GM. 


• Power protection for the door locking circuit is provided by a “time monitored” activation 
of the door lock actuators by the GM. The door lock actuators are provided power for 
the duration of time needed to run the actuator to the desired position. The maximum on 
time for the actuators is 0.7 seconds.
