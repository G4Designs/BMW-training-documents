G29 Body 
2. Body Structure 

2.1. Materials 



G29 body structure materials 


Index 

Explanation 

1 

Multiphase steels (high-strength steels > 300 N/mm 2 ) 

2 

Hot-worked steels (ultra high-strength steels > 900 N/mm 2 ) 

3 

Aluminum 

4 

Other steels 


The engine supports and spring supports of the G29 are made of aluminum. This allows an optimal 
weight distribution of the body structure. 

In the areas of the body structure that are relevant in the event of an accident, mainly high-strength 
and ultra high-strength steels are used. For example, the A-pillar and the windscreen frame are 
reinforced with ultra high-strength, hot-worked steels. Thanks to the particularly rigid windscreen 
frame in conjunction with the rollover protection bars, the survival space of the occupants is 
guaranteed in the event of a rollover.

G29 Body 
2. Body Structure 

2.2. Stiffening measures 

The body structure of the G29 is reinforced by numerous struts. A stiffening plate at the front axle 
provides stability. 

The G29 has a fixed rollover protection bar for the driver and front passenger. This also serves to brace 
the body, thus ensuring high driving dynamics.

6.3. Notes for Service 

6.3.1. Diagnostics 

The non-electrical diagnosis (NED) in the ISTA workshop information system should also always be 
included in all diagnostic work relating to water ingress, wind noises or operating noises. This includes 
information to assist in determining the causes of interference noises and leaks. In addition, remedial 
measures in the form of repair instructions, graphics or video sequences are shown. 

6.3.2. Close soft top manually 

The soft top can be closed manually in an emergency. This chapter describes the manual unlocking 
of the convertible top drive units as well as the manual locking of the soft top at the cowl panel. If the 
soft top is closed manually, the steps in the repair instructions must be observed in the prescribed 
sequence. 

Manual unlocking of the convertible top drive units 

There is a hex fitting under each of the linkage aperture flaps. The convertible top drives are unlocked 
via the hex fittings at the respective transmission. 

The hex fittings lock in the normal operating condition of the ring gear of the respective planetary 
gear set. If the ring gear is released, the transmission rotates freely. The soft top can then be closed 
manually. 

There are marks on the upper side of the hex fittings. They show the current operating condition of the 
convertible top drive units (locked/unlocked). 

A 

In order to lock the convertible top drive units again that were previously unlocked manually, the hex 
fittings must be turned when the soft top is opened. You must rock the front bow slightly in order to 
move the hex fittings into the correct position. Otherwise, the hex fittings could break.

Manual locking at cowl panel 

The soft top can be manually locked or unlocked at the cowl panel. The shaft of the drive pinion of the 
cowl panel lock drive is turned manually. 

Two people are required for the manual locking of the soft top at the cowl panel. While one person 
presses the front bow in the middle down towards closing, the other person actuates the cowl panel 
lock drive. 

A plastic adapter is used in order to connect the hexagon socket wrench in the toolkit with the square 
bolt of the cowl panel lock drive. It is located behind the trim at the soft top bow at the front.
