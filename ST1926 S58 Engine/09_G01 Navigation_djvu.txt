parameters. 


The vehicle must satisfy the following prerequisites: 


Navigation system Professional (OE 609)

The scale for the navigation map must not be set to more than 500 m (1/4 mile) to allow an overview of 
the parking information to be displayed in the navigation map. The parking information is displayed for 
a radius of 2 km (1.2 miles) around the current position of the vehicle.

Time information concerning parking spaces freed up by DriveNow vehicles 


A “P” in the map display indicates when a DriveNow vehicle leaves a parking space free. The circle 
around the “P” runs down, like a stopwatch. This lets you see how long ago the DriveNow vehicle left 
the space. A complete revolution of the circle takes 5 minutes. 


3.1.3. Cover 


Parking information is a ConnectedDrive service and is available in selected cities. A list of these can 
be accessed via the menu. At the start, parking information relates principally to a few major cities in 
Germany. The list can change at any time as this is a ConnectedDrive service. This means that other 
cities will be added.
