S58 Engine 
1. Introduction 

1.1. Highlights 

The S58 engine is the successor to the S55 engine. Like the S55 engine in the BMW M4 and BMW 
M2 Competition, the S58 engine is based on a BMW AG standard production engine. The S58 engine 
is based on the B58TU engine, as the engine identification highlights. 

Technical updates and modifications of M GmbH make the engine suitable for motor racing. 

With its turbocharged, high-revving design, the new M engine delivers impressive and undreamt-of 
power development with a nominal output of 353 kW/480 hp compared with the 317 kW/431 hp of 
its predecessor. The maximum torque, an indicator of the power delivery and performance perceived 
by the driver, has risen from 550 Nm to 600 Nm. This has been achieved despite the fact that fuel 
consumption and CO 2 emissions have been reduced with the aid of the BMW EfficientDynamics 
measures. 

As the S58 engine is based on the B58TU engine, it has been possible to carry over a number of 
engine components from the B58TU standard production engine. The other 90% of the engine 
components are new developments or synergy parts with the B58TU engine. All the technical data is 
above that of the predecessor.

4. Engine Mechanical 

4.1. Engine housing 

The engine housing comprises the crankcase, the cylinder head, the cylinder head cover, the sump 
and the gaskets. 


4.1.1. Oil sump 

The sump of the S58 engine is a cast aluminium design made of AISi9Cu3. The sump originally made 
of magnesium on the S55 engine was also replaced by cast aluminium sump in the course of life-cycle 
development of the S55 engine. An additional partition in the area of the drive shaft passages in the 
forward area of the sump further restricts oil movement under longitudinal and lateral acceleration 
forces.

Oil drain plug 


To ensure that the engine oil in the front, smaller sump is drained completely during an engine oil 
service, the sump features a small drain hole through which the engine oil can flow into the rear sump. 

Sealing of the sump against the crankcase is provided by means of a spray-on silicon sealant. 


13 









S58 Engine 
4. Engine Mechanical 

A 

The precise procedure for sealing the sump can be found in the up-to-date information in the BMW 
workshop system ISTA. 


4.1.2. Crankcase 

The crankcase of the S58 engine is made of gravity die-cast Al Si 7 Cu 0.5 Mg. 

As a heat management module is not used on the S58 engine, the coolant ducts and the coolant 
pump mounting have had to be adapted to the crankcase. 

That involved increasing the cross-sections of the water chambers in order to minimize the flow 
velocity of the coolant in the crankcase as much as possible due to the high delivery rate of approx. 
300 l/min of the new coolant pump. 

Furthermore, the mounting points for the ancillary components specific to the S58 engine have been 
adapted to the crankcase, and the oil ducts for piston cooling via the oil spray nozzles have been 
integrated.

S58 engine, ventilation bore holes in the crankcase 

The crankcase has drilled longitudinal ventilation holes (a). Those longitudinal ventilation holes 
(a) improve pressure equalization between the oscillating air columns created by the up and down 
movement of the pistons. 

In addition, adaptations of the connections to the two exhaust turbochargers, were necessary for the 
oil supply and coolant cooling. 

4.1.3. Cylinder head gasket 

In contrast with the B58TU engine, the cylinder head gasket in the S58 engine is made up of 4 layers 
(3 layers in the B58TU engine) because the combustion pressure is higher than in the S58 engine. 
Furthermore, the contact faces with the cylinder head and cylinder block are no longer fully coated 
but instead have a partial screen print coating. The cylinder head gasket has been adapted to the 
crankcase and the cylinder head in terms of the sealing bead pattern.

4.1.4. Cylinder head 

The cylinder head of the S58 engine has been adapted to motor racing requirements. The basic 
design of the cylinder head matches that of the B58TU engine. In addition, the cylinder head has 
a core manufactured using a 3D printing process. The additive manufacturing process makes it 
possible to produce geometrical shapes that cannot be achieved with conventional metal casting 
methods. Thanks to 3D printing technology, the cylinder head core of the new engine is lighter in 
weight and has optimized coolant duct routing in temperature management terms. The S58 engine 
again features direct injection, turbocharger aspiration and Valvetronic valve timing. The cylinder head 
is very compact and is equipped with the 4th-generation Valvetronic technology. 

A 

The combination of exhaust turbocharger, Valvetronic and direct fuel injection is known as 
Turbo Valvetronic Direct Injection (TVDI). 


17 











S58 Engine 
4. Engine Mechanical 



S58 engine, cylinder head 

The cylinder head of the S58 engine has been redesigned with regard to coolant duct routing. 

Thus, the S58 engine does not feature the split-cooling concept used on the B58TU engine. 

In addition, the mountings for the two high-pressure pumps on the cylinder head have been adapted. 

4.1.5. Cylinder head cover 

Design 

The cylinder head cover is a new part on the S58 engine. As distinct from the cylinder head cover of 
the B58TU engine, the mounts for the two high pressure pumps are machined into the cylinder head 
cover of the S58 engine. 

All the components for crankcase ventilation and the blow-by ducts are also integrated in the cylinder 
head cover. The integrated valves ensure that the blow-by gases are reliably fed into the intake air. 

The S58 engine is equipped with a positively controlled crankcase ventilation system.

The blow-by gases pass through the opening in the area of no. 6-cylinder into the settling chamber 
in the cylinder head cover. From the settling chamber, the blow-by gases pass through the particle 
separator with ball valve where they are separated from the oil by an artificial-felt element. The blow- 
by gases separated from the oil next pass either through the crankcase vent valve via the cylinder head 
into the intake area upstream of the intake valves or to the intake area upstream of the turbocharger, 
depending on the engine operating mode. The separated oil is directed via a return duct discharging 
into the sump below the oil level. A non-return valve in the lower part of the crankcase in the area of the 
sump ensures that no oil from the sump can pass into the crankcase ventilation system from the sump. 

A 

The precise procedure for removing and installing the cylinder head cover can be found in the up-to- 
date information in the BMW workshop system ISTA. 


Operating principle 

The standard function can only be utilized while there is a vacuum in the intake plenum, i.e. in naturally 
aspirated mode. 

In naturally aspirated mode, the crankcase vent valve and the ball valve in the particle separator in the 
cylinder head cover are opened by the vacuum in the intake plenum. The blow-by gases are routed via 
the distributor rail integrated in the cylinder head cover directly into the cylinder head intake ports.

Blow-by gas ducts 


Once the pressure in the intake plenum rises, it is no longer possible for the blow-by gases to be 
introduced via this route. The crankcase vent valve seals off the duct to the intake plenum. 


The then greater intake-air demand generates a vacuum in the clean air pipe between the 
turbocharger and the intake silencer. That vacuum is sufficient to keep the ball valve in the particle 
separator in the cylinder head cover open and draw off the blow-by gases.

If there is a complaint about higher oil consumption and at the same time an exhaust turbocharger 
fouled with oil is diagnosed, then it cannot be immediately concluded that the exhaust turbocharger 
is faulty. If the fouling is already present after the introduction of the blow-by gases, then the entire 
engine must be checked for leaks. The cause of an excessive blow-by gas flow rate may be faulty 
gaskets or crankshaft seals. Leaking crankshaft seals may generate oil consumption of up to 3 
liters/1000 km (620 miles). 


4.1.6. Engine cover 

The engine cover was adapted to the S58 engine. The engine cover is also the intake silencer of the 
S58 engine.

4.2. Crankshaft 


4.2.1. Crankshaft with bearings 

Crankshaft 

The crankshaft is an optimized-weight design and has been adapted to the high-revving 
characteristics and greater power output of the S58 engine. Thus the crankshaft of the S58 engine 
weighs approx. 21.2 kg (47 lbs). The crankshaft is also called a lightweight construction crankshaft. 
The crankshaft is made from a steel alloy 42CrMoS4 Mod and is then nitrocarbonized in the gas. 
The timing chain and oil pump are connected by gears.

Crankshaft main bearing 

The crankshaft main bearings are adapted to the S58 engine. Adaptations were necessary in order 
to satisfy the higher demands of the high-revving design. The bearings are a lead-free design. The 
material combination for the lower bearing shells takes the form of a Federal Mogul G488. For the 
upper bearing shells a Federal Mogul G490 is used. The thrust bearing is located at the 4th bearing 
position.

When replacing the crankshaft main bearings, the bearing shell classification must be taken into 
account. The precise procedure for replacing the crankshaft main bearing shells can be found in the 
up-to-date information in the BMW workshop system ISTA. 


4.2.2. Connecting rod with bearing 

The forged connecting rod of the S58 engine has a nominal length of 151.1 mm. The connecting 
rod is a carry-over part from the S63B44T4 engine. As with other BMW engines, the small end has a 
profiled bore. The force acting from the piston via the wrist pin is optimally distributed to the bushing 
surface by this shaped bore and the edge load.

The big-end bearing shells are of the lead-free type. Consequently, a Federal Mogul G488 is used on 
both the rod side and the bearing-cap side.

4.2.3. Piston with wrist pin and piston rings 

The shape and material properties of the piston have been adapted to the higher demands in terms of 
the high-revving design of the S58 engine with a rated engine speed of 7500 rpm. 

A forged slipper-skirt piston made by the manufacturer Mahle is used. The piston is made from the 
M142P alloy (AISi12Cu3Ni2Mg). This alloy is particularly suitable for high-performance petrol engines. 
For the S58 engine, the piston alloy is formed by forging, which produces slightly different micro¬ 
structures and properties. That is indicated by the suffix "P" in the alloy designation. 

The piston skirt is Grafal-coated, which is necessary due to the LDS-coated cylinder liners. 

The piston diameter is 84 mm. The first piston ring is a nitride plain rectangular compression ring. 

The 2nd piston ring is a taper-faced piston ring. The oil scraper ring is a nitride ES oil scraper ring.

Wrist pin 

The wrist pin with circlip was revised accordingly to the higher requirements in the S58 engine. 
The material and the strength were adapted to satisfy the high-speed concept. 

A so-called wrist pin with restricted volume change with 23 mm diameter is used. The wrist pin is 
made from the alloy 16MnCr5 and then case hardened (DLC diamond-like carbon). 


4.3. Camshaft drive/chain drive 

The entire chain drive system driving the camshafts on the S58 engine has been carried over from the 
N58TU engine. As on the B58TU engine, the composite camshafts are driven by an adapted single 
bushed-roller chain with 154 links. The tensioning rail is a carry-over part from the B58TU engine, 
while the bushed-roller chain itself and the guide rail have been adapted to the high-revving concept 
and higher power of the S58 engine.

The following graphic shows the design of the cylinder head on the S58 engine with the combination 
of Valvetronic IV and direct injection.

5.1.1. Camshafts 

In the S58 engine, similar to the S55 engine, only lightweight construction camshafts are used. The

engines.

The camshafts have been adapted to the high-rewing concept of the S58 engine in terms of cam

pump. The reluctor rings for the camshaft sensors have been realigned in comparison with the B58TU 
engine.

5.1.3. Intake and exhaust valves 

The valve stem of the intake valve has a diameter of 4.92 mm. For the exhaust valve the diameter is 
5.92 mm. The reason for the larger diameter is that the exhaust valve is hollow and has a sodium filling. 
In addition, the valve seat of the exhaust valve is armor-plated. 

In contrast with the B58TU, the intake valve material for the S58 engine, has been upgraded to a 
higher-quality alloy material to cope with the thermal and higher stress on the engine. 

5.1.4. Valve springs 

Due to the different shaft diameters between the intake and exhaust valves the valve springs are 
different. 


5.2. Valvetronic 


5.2.1. VANOS 


Overview 

The design and function of the variable camshaft timing system on the S58 engine is the same as on 
the B58TU engine. The VANOS system had already been optimized by virtue of the single chain drive 
on the B58TU engine in comparison with the B58 engine. That optimization resulted in shorter and 
more compact adjusters. 

The camshaft sprockets of the VANOS units have been adapted to suit the single bushed-roller chain 
on the S58 engine. 

VANOS solenoid valve actuators 

The VANOS solenoid valves used on the S58 engine are identical to those on the B58TU engine.

Overview 

As can be seen from the following graphic, the design of the valve lift control system has not changed 
in comparison with the B58TU engine. 

Due to the higher engine speeds of the S58 of up to 7500 rpm, the working curve of the eccentric 
shaft and intermediate lever has been adapted.

6. Belt Drive & Ancillary Components 

6.1. Belt drive 

Due to the modified design, the belt drive stem has had to be adapted. Between the combined 
vibration absorber and belt pulley on the crankshaft and the air conditioning compressor, an additional 
tensioning pulley is used. With help of the additional tensioning pulley possible oscillations of the drive 
belt between the vibration absorber with belt pulley and air conditioning compressor are suppressed.

6. Belt Drive & Ancillary Components 

The belt pulley for driving the coolant pump has been made as large in diameter as possible in 
order to reduce the speed of the pump and, thereby, the coolant delivery rate at high engine speeds 
(cavitation). 

The diameter of the belt pulley for driving the alternator has been changed in comparison with the one 
on the B58TU engine. That was necessary because, as a result of the higher revving speeds of the 
S58 engine compared with the B58TU engine, the alternator would otherwise have been driven too 
fast.

S58 Engine 
7. Oil Supply 

7.1. Differences in the oil supply 

• Sump with a small front oil sump as a volume buffer 

• Aluminium frame with oil extraction pipes and ducts bolted to the crankcase 

• Plastic cover with integrated gasket for better separation of the front and rear sump partitions 

• Oil pump as external gear pump with map control 

• Additional twin oil return pumps 

• Two oil spray nozzles per cylinder, plus one switchable nozzle 

• Centrally controllable piston cooling via oil spray nozzles. 


7.2. Oil supply adaptations 

The controlled-volumetric-flow pendulum vane pump familiar from the B58TU engine is not used 
on the S58 engine. The reason for this is that the S58 engine has an additional suction pump for the 
front oil sump. With the same concept involving a volume-flow-controlled pendulum-slide pump, this 
would have been too large for the limited packaging space. In addition, the volume-flow-controlled 
pendulum-slide pump used in the B58TU engine would not have been capable of providing a reliable 
oil supply in the high engine speed ranges that occur in the S58 engine. 

Therefore, a spur-gear pump with integrated twin oil return pump, which is also a spur-gear pump, is 
used on the S58 engine. This combination is more compact at a higher delivery rate than the volume- 
flow-controlled pendulum-slide pump. 

The external gear pump is volume-flow-controlled and is supplemented by a map control. 

Bolted onto the intake side of the crankcase is the oil filter module. The oil pressure sensor, the oil 
temperature sensor and the data-map control valve for the data-map controlled oil pump are bolted to 
the crankcase behind the oil filter module. 

The sump has a silicon sealant coating and is bolted to the crankcase. The sump is made of die-cast 
aluminium and holds the oil level sensor and the oil drain plug. 

The position and length of the oil pump intake snorkel has been adapted to the geometric shape of the 
oil pump. An additional twin oil return pump is flange-mounted on the oil pump. This was necessary in 
order to adapt the oil supply to racetrack use. This ensures a secure oil supply, even when the oil level 
is displaced during lateral and longitudinal accelerations, as can occur during racing applications.

Engine oil duct 


From the oil intake snorkel, the oil is conveyed by the external gear oil pump via the gears into the 
engine oil duct, into the engine block and to the oil filter. 


The non-driven oil pump gear can be axially shifted in this pump, thereby varying the delivery rate. 
Axial shifting is effected by the oil pressure from the filtered oil duct coming from the main oil duct, 
which can be varied via the map control valve by means of a control piston. The operating principle of 
the external gear oil pump ensures that the required oil quantity and the oil pressure are supplied in 
each case.

A spring diaphragm (6) is installed at the end of the intake pipe. The spring diaphragm dampens any

7.3.1. Maximum delivery 

In its basic position, the oil pump is held in the maximum delivery position by the pressure control 
spring (1). This position can also be actively approached via the map control valve from the minimum 
delivery position. The map control valve is switched so that the oil can flow into the sump via the map 
control valve. This position of the data-map control valve simultaneously directs the oil pressure from 
the filtered oil duct (2) via the oil duct (12) to the back of the piston pressure side (9) of the axially 
variable pump impeller (3). This oil pressure on the piston (9) supports the pressure control spring (1) 
and presses the axially movable impeller (3) into the maximum delivery position.

7.3.2. Minimum delivery 

If the data-map control valve directs the data-map control pressure via the control line (6) to the larger 
face of the control piston (8), the data-map control pressure overcomes the second-level control 
pressure due to the difference in surface area on the control piston (8). The map control pressure 
presses against the control piston spring and thus adjusts the control piston (8) toward minimum 
delivery. By being moved to the minimum delivery position, the control piston (8) opens the oil duct 
to the piston pressure side (15). The filtered oil from the oil duct (12) is now conveyed to the front 
piston pressure side (9) of the axially movable impeller (3). On account of the axial shift caused by the 
oil pressure, the planes of contact of the external gear wheels are reduced and the delivery rate of the 
filtered oil decreases. The oil on the rear piston pressure side can flow back into the sump via the oil 
duct outlet (13) and the oil return flow (14).

Through the interaction of the map control with the control piston (8), the delivery rate of the oil can be 
influenced via the axially movable impeller (3) by means of the Digital Motor Electronics (DME). 

7.3.3. Second-level control (emergency operation) 

During normal operation or if the map control fails, the delivery rate is determined via the second level 
control. The second-level control pressure (2) acts on the smaller, rear surface of the control piston (8). 
The second level control pressure (2) presses against the control piston spring and thus adjusts the 
control piston (8) toward minimum delivery. By being moved towards the minimum delivery position, 
the control piston (8) opens the oil duct to the forward piston pressure side (15). The filtered oil from 
the oil duct (12) is now conveyed to the front piston pressure side (9) of the axially movable impeller 
(3). On account of the axial shift caused by the oil pressure, the planes of contact of the external gear 
wheels are reduced and the delivery rate of the filtered oil decreases. 


7.4. Map control valve 

On the S58 engine, the data-map control valve is mounted on the crankcase and connected to the oil 
pump via holes drilled in the crankcase. 

The map-controlled control valve is a proportional valve which can control the oil pressure steplessly.

The oil pressure sensor and the oil temperature sensor are connected to the main oil duct and supply 
the actual oil pressure and the engine oil temperature to the DME control unit. The DME calculates 
the required target oil pressure based on the engine's operating point and the temperature. A pulse- 
width modulated signal is sent to the map-controlled control valve based on the determined setpoint 
deviation. Depending on the pulse-width modulated signal, the width of the valve spool opening in the 


47 










































S58 Engine 
7. Oil Supply 

map-controlled control valve varies. Depending on the available opening cross-section, more or less 
engine oil can flow from the oil duct of the oil filter into the oil duct and to the oil pump. This oil flow 
changes the position of the control piston in the oil pump, and therefore the delivery rate of the pump. 


7.5. Oil supply during high acceleration 

In order to adapt the oil supply system to motor racing requirements, a twin oil return pump has been 
installed to ensure the system functions effectively. The oil return pump assists return of the oil from 
the turbochargers and from the forward sections of the sump back to the rear section of the sump.

With these changes, the oil supply can be guaranteed up to a longitudinal acceleration of 1.3 g. Even in 
the case of lateral acceleration, for example during cornering, this structure enables a secure oil supply 
up to constant 1.3 g. 

In such driving situations, the engine oil is drawn out of the front of the sump through the front oil 
intake snorkel by the return pumps during longitudinal acceleration. The oil drawn off is pumped back 
to the rear part of the sump via the return pipe in the aluminium frame. There the external gear oil 
pump can take up the oil again via the rear oil intake snorkel and deliver it to the engine lubrication 
points. 

Also at the bearing positions of the exhaust turbocharger the engine oil may collect due to the 
centrifugal force during lateral acceleration conditions. This prevents a normal backflow to the oil 
sump and thus also a supply of fresh cool engine oil at the bearing positions. 

To counteract this effect, at the bearing positions of the exhaust turbocharger the engine oil is 
continuously drawn in by the suction pump and delivered to the oil sump.

The twin oil return pumps are spur-gear oil pumps. The outer upper chamber of the gear pump is the 
suction chamber. The oil intake snorkels from the front part of the sump are connected to the suction 
chamber and the engine oil is drawn off through the aluminium frame with integral oil return pumps. 

The lower chamber is a pressure chamber. Via the pressure chamber, the drawn-in engine oil is 
delivered back to the rear oil sump via the return opening in the upper section of the oil pump unit. 
The engine oil in the rear oil sump is thus available again to the oil pump via the oil intake snorkel.

7.6. Oil spray nozzles 

Two types of oil spray nozzle are used on the S58 engine. They are the conventional regulated oil 
spray nozzles with a permanently set opening and closing pressure, and the switchable oil spray 
nozzles.

The controlled oil spray nozzles used on the intake side of the crankcase are conventional oil spray 
nozzles with a permanently set opening and closing pressure. 

The oil spray nozzles do not open until the oil pressure reaches 4.3 bar in order to ensure sufficient 
piston crown cooling regardless of the load at high engine speeds. The oil spray nozzles close again if 
the oil pressure falls below 4 bar. 

The switched oil spray nozzles on the exhaust side are brought into action for cooling at high loads and 
engine speeds and also for lubrication at very low engine speeds with high engine loads. 

A 

In order to achieve an optimum cooling effect, it is essential to position the oil spray nozzles exactly. 
Non-compliance may lead to damage to the engine. Please observe the current repair instructions in 
the BMW workshop system ISTA.

7. Oil Supply 

7.7. Centrally controllable piston cooling via oil spray nozzles 

In addition to the bearing positions, the oil pump also supplies the oil spray nozzles with the required 
volumetric flow, whereby the consumption of the oil spray nozzles significantly influences the power of 
the oil pump. 

For that reason, the S58 engine is the first petrol engine to feature centrally controllable piston cooling. 
Deactivating the piston cooling reduces the oil pump power. In turn, this reduces the power loss of the 
engine and saves fuel in the partial load range with the same vehicle performance. 

The centrally controllable piston cooling has the following special features: 

• Additional oil ducts in the cylinder crankcase 

• Oil spray nozzles without defined opening pressure 

• Piston cooling control valve 

• Piston cooling relay valve. 

The central valve controls the oil spray nozzles on the exhaust side of the crankcase. This enables 
requirement-based piston cooling over the entire characteristic map range of the engine. 

The following system overview provides an initial outline of the structure of the piston cooling in the 
S58 engine.

As a result of the controllable piston cooling used on the S58 engine, the piston cooling can be 
selectively deactivated independently of engine oil pressure with the following benefits: 

• Lower drive power of the oil pump 

• Smaller dimensioning of the oil pump 

• Lower fuel consumption 

• Lower exhaust emissions 

7.7.1. Relay valve control valve 

The valves have the task of selectively activating or deactivating the piston cooling and consist of the 
following two components: 

• Piston cooling control valve 

• Piston cooling relay valve 

Piston cooling control valve 

The piston cooling control valve is necessary in order to operate the piston cooling relay valve. 
Actuation is performed on demand by the DME control unit.

The following operating condition opens the piston cooling relay valve and activates piston cooling: 

• Oil pressure from the main oil duct > 1 bar. 

Piston is moved against the spring force. 

Channel to the oil spray nozzles is opened and the pistons are cooled. 

Oil that is behind the piston can drain into the crank chamber via the control channel, the 
piston cooling control valve and the return channel. 

The following operating conditions prevent the piston cooling relay valve from opening and deactivate 
piston cooling: 

• Oil pressure from the main oil duct < 1 bar. 

Spring force is greater than the oil pressure from the main oil duct. 

Channel to the oil spray nozzles is not opened. 

• Piston cooling control valve energized. 

Oil is directed from the piston cooling control valve through the control channel to the 
space behind the pistons of the piston cooling relay valve. 

Oil pressure and spring force generate a back-pressure and seal off the piston cooling relay 
valve from the main oil duct. 

The channel to the oil spray nozzles can no longer be opened.

7.8. Oil filter and engine oil cooling 

The oil filter housing is made from aluminium. For engine cooling, a discrete engine oil cooler is used 
which is fitted horizontally in front of the radiator module. Depending on the engine oil temperature, a 
thermostat at the oil filter housing enables the oil flow to the engine oil cooler.

The thermostat opens and closes under the following three operating conditions: 

• Engine oil temperature < 100 ±2 °C (212 ±35 °F): The entire oil flow is passes directly through 
the oil filter. 

• Engine oil temperature 100 ±2 °C -114 ±2 °C (212 ±35 °F - 237 ±35 °F): Part of the oil flow 
passes through the engine oil cooler and then through the oil filter, the rest passes directly 
through the oil filter. 

• Engine oil temperature > 114 ± 2 °C (237 ±35 °F): The flow through the engine oil cooler is 
regulated in order to obtain the target engine oil temperature. 

100 °C (212 °F) is chosen as the initial opening temperature because then the condensation water in 
the oil evaporates through the crankcase ventilation system. 


7.9. Engine oil monitoring 

7.9.1. Oil pressure 

Because the S58 engine has a data-map controlled oil pump, it is necessary to precisely register the 
oil pressure. For that reason, an oil pressure sensor is used. 

The advantages of the sensor are: 

• Measurement of the absolute pressure (previously used relative pressure) 

• Characteristic map control possible at every engine speed 


7.9.2. Oil temperature 

The familiar oil temperature sensor from the N55 engine is used to measure the oil temperature. 

7.9.3. Oil level 

The familiar oil-level sensor, which simultaneously measures the temperature in the sump, is used to 
measure the oil level.

7.10. Service information 

At present, as with other BMW M models with S engines, an engine oil change at 
2,000 km (1200 mile) (running-in check) is provided for in the case of the S58 engine. 

To ensure that the engine oil in the front, smaller sump is drained completely during an engine oil 
service, the upper section of the sump features a small drain hole through which the engine oil can 
flow to the rear sump.

8. Intake Air and Exhaust System 

8.1. Air intake system 

8.1.1. Overview 

For the S58 engine the intake air system had to be completely realigned. 

• Air intake duct up to the intake silencer 

• Clean air duct due to new exhaust turbochargers completely new 

• Crankcase venting components 

• Indirect charge air cooling 

• Coolant-cooled electromotive throttle controller 

• Tank ventilation system adapted. 

As can be seen from the graphics, the design of the intake air system is more complex, 
as two turbochargers are fitted and indirect charge air cooling is employed.

8.1.2. Air mass determination 

On the US and Europe versions, the intake air mass flow is not measured by a hot-film air mass meter 
but calculated by the DME. For this calculation, an experience-based filling calculation (filling model) is 
programmed in the DME. The following signals are applied to this calculation. 

Signals: 

• VANOS setting (load sensing) 

• Throttle valve position (throttling) 

• Intake air temperature (air density correction) 

• Engine temperature (air density correction) 

• Engine speed (cylinder charging) 

• Intake manifold differential pressure (throttling correction) 

• Ambient pressure (air density based on altitude correction). 

The air mass calculated in this way is adjusted and corrected if necessary in line with the oxygen 
sensor signals (air/fuel ratio) and the injection period (fuel quantity). Should the oxygen sensors fail, a 
fault memory entry is made in the DME (air mass plausibility). Adjustment to the calculated air mass 
does not apply in this case. 

The monitoring of the tank ventilation system for leaks that is legally required on the US is performed 
by the venturi nozzle pressure sensor on the S58 engine. Therefore, it has been possible to dispense 
with the hot film air mass meter. 


8.1.3. Tank ventilation system 

In a carbon canister the fuel vapors are stored temporarily and fed for combustion via the tank vent 
valve. With turbocharging it is necessary to also adapt this system to the specifications.

8.1.4. Venturi nozzle pressure sensor 

The flow of scavenging air is generated by the vacuum in the intake pipe. In order to be able to 
scavenge in turbocharged mode as well, vacuum is generated by means of a venturi nozzle. The 
venturi nozzle is powered by an air mass flow which is tapped downstream of the intercooler and fed 
back in upstream of the impeller. The venturi nozzle pressure sensor in the tank vent pipe is used to 
diagnose the second feed-in point of the tank ventilation system. 

Strain gauges are used to determine the pressure. A steel diaphragm in the sensor fitted with strain 
gauges is deformed by the pressure present. The changes in resistance of the strain gauges are 
electronically analyzed by a Wheatstone bridge. The voltage measured is then included in the tank 
ventilation diagnosis as an actual data reading. The venturi nozzle pressure sensor is a differential 
pressure sensor. 

8.1.5. Carbon canister 

To meet emission standards in the US, a carbon canister with a larger volume is used. The basic 
function of the carbon canister has not changed. The increase in volume is solely for the purpose of 
collecting larger amounts of fuel vapor and retaining them for longer before a flushing operation by the 
tank vent valve takes place. 


8.2. Exhaust emission system 

8.2.1. Overview 

The exhaust emission system has a different structure in the S58 engine with the two exhaust 
turbochargers than in the B58TU engine with a twin-scroll exhaust turbocharger. The exhaust system 
is a cylinder-dependent twin-pipe design. 

The exhaust system was designed for minimum exhaust gas pressure. With this dethrottling of the 
exhaust system, the efficiency of the gas exchange could be optimized even further.

8.2.2. Exhaust manifold with turbocharger 

The exhaust manifold is designed in relation to the bank. One exhaust manifold is used for every bank. 
The condensing of the three exhaust ducts into a single exhaust duct results in an optimal inflow of 
the turbine of the exhaust turbocharger. The exhaust manifold is cast into one part together with the 
turbine housing of the exhaust turbocharger and is thus one component.

The S58 engine has a twin-turbocharger system using mono-scroll turbochargers as also used on the 
S55 engine. The system supplier for the mono-scroll turbocharger assembly on the S58 engine is the 
MHI Group. 


8.2.3. Electrical wastegate valve actuator 

The S58 engine uses an electric wastegate controller. The function of the electric wastegate controller 
on the S58 engine is the same as on the BMW AG engines. 

The fundamental advantages of the electric wastegate controller are: 

• High adjustment speed 

• Precise charging pressure control 

• High closing force, thus less leakage and quicker build-up of charging pressure 

• Complete opening of the wastegate valve possible. This supports quick heating up with a cold 
catalytic converter. 

• Thus lower exhaust emissions 

• Fuel economy 

The electric wastegate controller is controlled directly by the DME control unit using a pulse-width 
modulated (PWM) signal. 

8.2.4. Catalytic converter 

The S58 engine has one close-to-engine catalytic converter per cylinder bank, each with a ceramic 
monolith.

8.2.5. Front oxygen sensor 

The oxygen sensor (LSU 5.2) from Bosch is used as a control sensor before the catalytic converter. 
The function is comparable to the oxygen sensor (LSU AVD) and therefore is not described in detail 
here. 

The oxygen sensor before catalytic converter (LSU 5.2) is characterized by the following advantages: 

• High signal running, especially in charged operation due to lower M dynamic pressure 
dependence 

• Increased durability thanks to reduced pump voltage 

• Increased accuracy 


70 









S58 Engine 

8. Intake Air and Exhaust System 


• Rapid operating readiness < 7 s 

• Higher heater output at 10 W 

• Increased temperature compatibility 

• Improved system connector with better contact properties 

The LSU 5.2 has an extended measuring range. It is thus possible to measure precisely from oxygen 
sensor 0.65 and higher. The new oxygen sensor is operational earlier, meaning exact measured values 
are available after only 7 s. 

The measuring dynamics of the sensor is higher, whereby it is possible to determine the air/fuel ratio 
in each cylinder separately and thus also control it. As a result, a homogeneous exhaust flow can be 
adjusted, the emission levels lowered and the long-term emission behavior optimized. 

8.2.6. Monitoring oxygen sensor 

The oxygen sensor after the catalytic converter is also called a monitoring sensor. The monitoring 
sensor LSF XFOUR from Bosch is used which is the successor sensor to the LSF 4.2. 

The LSF Xfour needs the DME 8.6.S for signal analysis and is distinguished by the following 
characteristics: 

• To achieve quicker response characteristics after engine start (half of the LSF 4.2 value), 
a stronger controlled heater has been integrated in the LSF Xfour. 

• This improves signal stability. 

• Less space is required for installation. 

• Thanks to the high temperature resistance and optimal thermoshock protection, the 
resistance to condensation in the exhaust tract following a cold start has been improved. 


A_ 

Depending on the conditioning of the emission control systems, it may take around 30 seconds 
for the full power of the engine to be available after it is started. In that period, the DME control unit 
activates a substitute program that is required in order to quickly bring the emission control systems 
up to operating temperature. In that situation the full power of the engine is not available as normal. If 
necessary, the driver is notified of the situation by a CCM (check control message). 


8.2.7. Rear silencer 

The rear silencer has the typical M chrome-plated exhaust tailpipe trims. 

The electrical exhaust flaps are activated directly by the DME by a pulse-width modulated signal.

8.2.8. Electrically controlled exhaust flaps 

The exhaust flaps are integrated in the rear silencer in the outer exhaust tailpipes. The exhaust flaps 
are operated by an axially aligned electric motor with integrated gears and electronics. The electric 
controller for the exhaust flaps has the following connections: 

• Voltage supply (+) 

• Ground (-) 

• Actuating wire (signal line) 

The exhaust flaps can be used influence the acoustics of the engine at low engine revs and low loads 
for reasons of comfort. In addition, the exhaust flap is intended to reduce the external noise levels in 
everyday urban use. 

At high engine speeds and high engine loads, the exhaust gas counterpressure can be reduced by 
opening the exhaust flap. 


72 











S58 Engine 

8. Intake Air and Exhaust System 

If the electric controller detects an internal fault, it notifies the DME control unit engine management. 

The exhaust flap cannot adopt an intermediate setting; it is either fully opened or closed. The flap is 
moved to the respective mechanical end stops by means of pulse-width modulated signals (PWM 
signals). 


Electrical exhaust flap

Installation location right and left 

PWM signal open 10% duty cycle 

PWM signal closed 90% duty cycle 


A_ 

The electrical controller of the exhaust flap can be replaced separately. The controller can be moved 
into an installation position using the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 


The exhaust flaps are operated on a demand-oriented basis and can be influenced by setting the 
engine dynamics control buttons to “Efficient”, “Sport” or “Sport+”. 

Apart from the engine dynamics control buttons, the position of the exhaust flaps can also be 
influenced by the sound button in the center console switch cluster. 

In default mode the button is deactivated and the acoustic characteristics linked to the modes. If the 
Sound button is pressed then the vehicle interior acoustics are trimmed to the maximum comfort 
setting. That is independent of the selected driving mode - in other words the Sound button overrides 
other acoustics settings. 

Thus, in order to obtain maximum comfort (quietness) when the Sound button is active, the exhaust 
flap is kept closed for as long as possible. Therefore, it no longer opens when the driver calls for more 
power but instead in response to the exhaust mass flow rate. It remains closed as long as it does not 
affect performance and fuel consumption or until the perceived noise level in the vehicle interior is 
more comfortable. 

Activation of the Sound button also reduces all other activities that have an effect on the interior 
acoustics (ASD). 

If the vehicle has not entered sleep mode, i.e. is started up again after being parked for a short period, 
the settings are retained. The same applies to the Auto Start/Stop function. 

Due to the internal interconnection of the exhaust tailpipes, the exhaust always flows through both 
pairs of tailpipes regardless of the flap setting. 

The sound button is connected with the Body Domain Controller (BDC) via a LIN bus. 

8.2.9. M Sport exhaust system 

The M Sport exhaust system SA 1MA comes as standard with Competition package SA 7MN on the 
F97/F98.) 


73 







S58 Engine 

8. Intake Air and Exhaust System 

The design of the sports exhaust system only differs from the standard production exhaust system by 
virtue of the internal design of the rear silencer. That design feature in the area of the rear silencer and 
the controlled exhaust flaps has made it possible to give the F97/F98 with M Sport exhaust system an 
even more distinctly powerful, richer and more emotive sound than the standard production exhaust 
system.

In contrast with the exhaust flaps on the standard exhaust system, the exhaust flaps of the M Sport 
exhaust system can adopt intermediate positions. Therefore, it is possible for the exhaust flaps to 
be continuously variably adjusted to any position. On vehicles with the M Sport exhaust system, the 
exhaust flap is fully open in Sport mode. 

The sports exhaust system of the F97/F98 features black chrome-plated tailpipe trims as a visual 
identification feature. 

A further, more emotive adaptation of the interior sound in the F97/F98 with M Sport exhaust system is 
made possible by a different Active Sound Design (ASD) tuning.

The following overview shows the entire fuel preparation. The fuel preparation of the S58 engine is 
closely related to the fuel preparation of the B58TU engine. As distinct from the B58TU engine, the 
S58 engine uses twin high-pressure pumps. This is necessary in order to provide the higher fuel level 
in the rail to achieve the required performance data and engine speeds of the S58 engine.

10.2. Low-pressure fuel system 

The F97/F98 with S58 engine is fitted with a 65-liter fuel tank. 

The fuel is delivered from the fuel tank through the electric fuel pump via the feed line at a primary 
pressure of 5 bar to the high pressure pumps. The fuel is conveyed from the electric fuel pump as 
required. 

To monitor the fuel pressure, a fuel low-pressure sensor is used that measures and monitors the fuel 
pressure on the low-pressure side. The fuel low-pressure sensor is connected to and monitored by the 
DME. 

In the event of a failure of the fuel pressure sensor the electric fuel pump continues to operate at 100% 
delivery rate with terminal 15 ON. 


10.3. High-pressure fuel system 

For the S58 engine, the high-pressure injection HDE 6 is used. 

Changes were made in regard to the fuel injection pressure, which can now range up to 350 bar. 
Increasing the fuel injection pressure from 200 bar to 350 bar results in the following advantages: 

• Improved fuel atomization 

• More efficient delivery 

• Reduced fuel wall film formation 

• Shorter injection periods 

These advantages due to the fuel injection pressure increase to 350 bar led to the following 
improvements: 

• Reduction in particle emissions 

• Improved engine response under high engine load 

• Improved engine response under M dynamic engine operation 

Bosch high-pressure fuel injection valves with the designation HDEV 6 with CVO are used. Due to 
the fuel system pressure increase from 200 bar to 350 bar, the solenoid valve injectors HEDV6 were 
optimized using suitable materials and coatings.

S58 Engine 

10. Fuel Preparation 

The S58 engine has two high-pressure pumps connected in parallel. The two high-pressure pumps 
are operated in alternation every 30 seconds. That ensures that both high-pressure pumps are evenly 
loaded when the vehicle is being driven moderately. When the vehicle is being driven harder or at 
full power, both high-pressure pumps are operated simultaneously. This was necessary in order to 
satisfy the higher throughput volume of fuel at high engine speeds. Control is effected by means of the 
volume control valve of the high-pressure pumps using a PWM signal. 

The piston and tappet of the high-pressure pump have been modified and materials adapted but its 
general design is familiar from the previous 3, 4, 6 and 8-cylinder engines. The triple cams on the high- 
pressure pump drive mechanisms for each pump have an interval of 120° in each case. The two drive 
cam pairs, which drive the two high-pressure pumps, are arranged so that there is a delivery every 60°. 

A 

Work on the fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. The coolant temperature 
must not exceed 40 °C. This stipulation must be observed without fail, as otherwise there is a risk of 
fuel being sprayed back on account of the residual pressure in the high-pressure fuel system. 

When working on the high-pressure fuel system, it is essential to adhere to conditions of absolute 
cleanliness and to observe the work sequences described in the repair instructions. Even the slightest 
contamination and damage to the screwed fittings of the high-pressure lines can cause leaks. 

When working on the fuel system of the S58 engine, it is important to ensure that the ignition coils are 
not fouled with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by sustained contact 
with fuel. This may result in flashovers on the spark plug head and thus in misfires. 

• Before making any modifications to the fuel system, without fail remove the ignition coils and 
protect the spark plug shaft against ingress of fuel by covering with a cloth. 

• Prior to a new installation of the solenoid valve injectors, the ignition coils must be 
disassembled and the highest possible level of hygiene ensured. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced. 

• The CVO function comprises the "injector" and "digital engine electronics" (DME) system 
components. These components therefore have to be identified with the vehicle identification 
number in the EPC in the event of a replacement. 

• Where injectors and DME support the CVO function, the injection quantity compensation 
during the replacement of one of the components is omitted. 

• An excessive rotational angle at the injector shank, and excessive tensile and compressive 
forces during removal and installation can lead to damage and therefore leaks in the fuel 
system. 

• For any service work required, the current information and specifications in the documents in 
the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA) must be observed in each case.

The thermostat used is a data-map thermostat which can be controlled by the DME. The thermostat 
starts opening at a coolant temperature of 101 °C (214 °F). The thermostat is fully open at a coolant 
temperature of 120 °C (248 °F).

Electric coolant pump for exhaust turbocharger

Exhaust turbocharger 


The electric coolant pump for the turbochargers is a 20 W pump which communicates with the 
DME via a LIN bus. The conventional coolant pump is driven via the drive belt and cannot be used 
for cooling the exhaust turbocharger after the engine has shut down. This is why there is an electric 
coolant pump for this separate cooling circuit. But also during engine operation the electric coolant 
pump is switched on taking into account the following factors: 

• Coolant temperature at the engine outlet 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected fuel quantity 

Using these values the heat input into the engine is calculated. The run-on period of the electric 
coolant pump can last up to 30 min. To improve the cooling effect, the electric fan also cuts in and may 
run on for up to 11 min. 

11.2.2. Charge air cooling 

In the S58 engine, like in the B58TU engine, so-called "indirect" charge air cooling is used. During 
the indirect charge air cooling the charge air is cooled via a low-temperature cooling circuit. The low- 
temperature coolant circuit is then cooled again by the atmospheric airflow induced by vehicle motion 
acting on two water-to-air heat exchangers.

The capacity of the charge air cooling circuit is approx. 4 liters. The coolant in the charge air cooling 
system is circulated by a 130 W electric coolant pump which communicates with the DME via a LIN 
bus. The two water-to-air heat exchangers are connected in parallel and are supplied via an expansion 
tank, which is attached to the vehicle. The indirect charge air cooler has a cooling power of 36 kW.

12.1. Engine control unit 

A new generation of Bosch engine control units is used in the S58 engine. 8th-generation engine 
electronics (DME) features a common control unit platform for petrol and diesel engines that is already 
used with modular engines. Its appearance is characterized by a uniform housing and a uniform 
connector strip. However, the hardware inside has been adapted to the various applications. 

The control unit code (DME 8.6.S) can be deciphered as follows: 

Abbreviation Meaning 

DME Digital Motor Electronics 

8 Control unit generation (modular operating system for petrol and diesel engine) 

6 Number of cylinders as hexadecimal figure 

S M Sport engine management 

Number of cylinders as a hexadecimal figure: 

• 3 = 3-cylinder engine 

• 4 = 4-cylinder engine 

• 6 = 6-cylinder engine 

• S = 8-cylinder engine 

• C = 12-cylinder engine 

Hardware variant: 

• S = M Sport engine management 
Examples for petrol engines: 

DME 8.4.OH = B48 PHEV* * (variant electrical system 1) 

• DME 8.6.1 = B58 ( electrical system 2 variant) 

• DME 8.6.S = S58 (electrical system 2 variant)

12.1.2. Overall function 

The Digital Engine Electronics (DME) is the computing and switching center of the engine control 
system. Sensors on the engine and on the vehicle deliver the input signals. The signals for activating 
the actuators are calculated from the input signals, the setpoint values calculated using a computing 
model in the DME control unit and the stored characteristic maps. The DME control unit activates the 
actuators directly or via relays. 

The PT-CAN wakes up the DME control unit. 

The after-run begins once the terminal is switched to OFF. The adaptation values are stored during the 
after-run. The DME control unit uses a bus signal to signal its readiness to "go to sleep". When all the 
participating control units have signalled their readiness to "go to sleep", the bus master outputs a bus 
signal and the control units terminate communication 5 seconds later. 


93

12. Engine Electrical System 

The printed circuit board in the DME control unit accommodates two sensors: a temperature sensor 
and an ambient pressure sensor. The temperature sensor is used to monitor the temperature of the 
components in the DME control unit. The ambient pressure is required for calculating the mixture 
composition.
