G01 Introduction and Body 

1. Introduction 

1.1. Overview 

In November 2017, the 3rd generation of the BMW X3 Series is being launched on the market with 
the G01. The G01 has adopted a wealth of technologies from the current BMW 5 Series and 7 Series. 
The design was developed further and now bears the typical BMW look with its wider kidney grills and 
distinctly larger headlights. The closed radiator grill and the precise contours of the hood lend the front 
of the new BMW X3 Series a sporty character. The elegant lines of the side view are emphasized by 
the accentuated Hofmeister kink. 

The new BMW X3 is technologically based on the G12 and G30. The topics listed below are described 

in the ST1501 G12 Complete Vehicle and ST1604 G30 Complete Vehicle product information.

1.5.2. Underbody 

The almost fully closed vehicle underbody plays an important role in the aerodynamics. The acoustics 
in the vehicle are also significantly improved as a result. In the front section, the air flow is directed 
past the front wheels with precision by the displacers. In this way, direct impact of the flow on the front 
wheel is reduced. Two wind deflectors in the rear area at the axle create an optimal underbody airflow. 
Most of the technical components are protected by the underbody panelling.

G01 Introduction and Body 

2. Bodyshell 

2.1. Body structure 

The lightweight body construction concept of the G01 comprises high-strength steel and aluminium 
components. Thanks to the material mix, the materials are able to contribute their specific strengths 
to the vehicle in the best possible way. As a result of the strict lightweight construction philosophy, 
the weight of the body has been reduced over that of the predecessor F25, but crash safety has been 
further improved. No carbon parts are integrated in the body structure.

2.1.2. Aluminium 

The use of aluminium extruded profiles and complex die-cast aluminium parts permits realization of 
high body rigidity in combination with low weight. All requirements relating to passive safety are also 
met.

G01 Introduction and Body 

2. Bodyshell 

The spring strut domes at the front in the BMW X3 are now also manufactured using the aluminium 
die casting method and the engine support is produced from an aluminium extruded profile. This 
contributes to excellent weight distribution in the body structure. New aluminium cast alloys were 
developed in order to increase the crash safety of these components.

2.2. Screw connections 

Some of the aluminium-steel connections in the G01 body structure are produced using a new body 
joining technique: flow drill screws. These include, for example, the connection between the engine 
support (aluminium extruded profile) and the bulkhead carrier support (ultra-high-strength hot-formed 
steel). 


7 










G01 Introduction and Body 

2. Bodyshell 

Flow drill screws are driven directly into the superposed sheets. When this happens, the specially 
shaped tip produces a flow hole and a thread is then cut. This joining technique is used exclusively in 
production.

Once a self-tapping screw connection has been loosened, it must not be re-joined using self-tapping 
screws. Otherwise this will lead to a considerable reduction in strength. 

During repairs according to body repair levels 2 and 3, the self-tapping screws are replaced by blind 
rivets.

3. Body Repair Level 1 

3.1. Repair Level 1 

Taking into account the repair stages of the BMW workshop information system, the body repair work 
in the Technical Qualification is divided into 3 repair levels. Each of the 3 Body Repair Levels includes 
certain prerequisites in terms of the qualifications of the employees and the workshop equipment. 

The special characteristics of the add-on body parts and the materials used in the outer body skin are 
described in this chapter. However, the basic functions of the roof and the outer body skin components 
made of plastic are the same as on other current BMW models. For this reason, these components will 
not be described in detail here.

3. Body Repair Level 1 

Compared to the predecessor F25, the front doors, hood and the front fenders of the G01 are made of 
aluminium. The rear doors are made of bake-hardening steel. This use of material leads to a significant 
reduction in weight. 

The bumper panels at front and rear as well as the rocker panels are made of plastic (PP + EPDM) 
as before. However, further development of this material made it possible to reduce the density and 
weight. 


3.3. Light carpet 

In addition to the G12 BMW 7 Series, the G01 BMW X3 is now the second vehicle to be equipped 
with the light carpet as welcome lighting. The light carpet is a graphic projection in the entrance and 
exit area on the driver's and front passenger's sides that is generated by an LED element. The LED 
element is installed behind the side sill trim panel and can be adjusted from the outside. 

Further information on the light carpet and the settings can be found in ST1501 G12 Body.

3.4. Tailgate 

The new X3 features a steel tailgate in monocoque construction. Through the use of an IHU (internal 
high pressure forming) in the tailgate structure, it was possible to reduce the weight by 2.2 kg / 4.8 lbs 
compared to the F25. This design alos allows better rear window visibility. Forming of or damage to 
the IHU profile must be avoided. The multi-part layout of the tailgate is achieved with the aid of state- 
of-the-art laser welding techniques.

4.1. Instrument panel overview 

The vehicle interior shows significant improvements in comparison to the F25. The interior look and 
all-round visibility have been improved. This is further supported by the very flat design of the roof 
function center. In addition, the headliner, which is equipped with sound insulation, helps to make it 
noticeably easier for passengers to have conversations with each other between the first and second 
rows of seats.

4.4.3. Rear seats 

The decorative stitches and back stitching, which are already in use in the first row of seats, are also 
carried over into the second row of seats, where they help create a harmonious overall impression. The 
second row of seats offers space for up to 3 passengers and for transporting 3 child seats, of which 
the 2 outer seats can be secured using the ISOFIX system. Functionality is underlined thanks to the 
easily accessible ISOFIX attachments and the cup holders in the center armrest. A high degree of 
customer benefit is derived from the usual 40:20:40 foldable rear seat backrest, which is integrated as 
standard equipment and can be conveniently unlocked remotely from the luggage compartment. The 
rear seat position for the passengers can be individually adjusted by adjusting the backrest tilt. This 
setting is adjusted via cables and positions the backrest in 4 different positions. The customer can 
select seat heating in the rear as optional equipment (OE 4HA).

The luggage compartment capacity of the new G01 X3 is identical to the F25 and remains at 550 
liters. The addition of an space-saver spare (OE 300) as optional equipment reduces the luggage 
compartment capacity. In vehicles with the space-saver spare optional equipment (OE 300), the 
customer can restore the luggage compartment capacity back to 550 liters by taking out the insert 
along with the space-saver spare.

6.1. Concept 

The G01 X3 will be the first BMW SAV in the US to feature a optional factory installed trailer hitch (OE 
3AC). The hitch will come equipped with a 2” square receiver that will enable customers to use a broad 
range of BMW Accessories including tongues, drop tongues, tow balls and step to help access roof 
mounted accessories and several varities of bike racks. 

The maximum towing capacity of the G01 will be approximately 2000 kg (4400 lbs) with a nose weight 
of 200 kg (441 lbs).
