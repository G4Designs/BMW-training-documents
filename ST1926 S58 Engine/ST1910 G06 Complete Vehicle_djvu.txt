G06 Complete Vehicle 

1. Introduction 


The new BMW X6 with the development code G06 will be launched in November 2019. It places 
the emphasis on power and athleticism. The G06 combines the presence of an X model with the 
sportiness of a Coupe. Based on the G05, the G06 has a sportier design without compromising on 
functionality. 

Since the G05 forms the basis for the G06, this product information module only describes the 
particular features specific to the BMW X6. Details of all the shared features can be found in the 
product information modules for the G05 and G07.

2.1. Exterior equipment 

2.1.1. Exterior design 

Even though the G06 is based on the G05, the exterior design of the BMW X6 differs from that of the 
BMW X5. Particularly striking at the front is the kidney-shaped radiator grill with its distinct design. The 
individually fashioned front and rear bumpers and the roof and rear spoilers underline the emphatically 
sporty character of the G06.

♦ Activating the ambient lighting. 

It can also be used while driving by activating the ambient lighting. 

2.1.3. Flow-optimized A-pillar and exterior mirror 

The A-pillar and the exterior mirror are flow-optimized in the new BMW X6. These measures reduce 
the generation of noise at the front side windows and thereby enhance passenger comfort.

2.2.3. Second-row seating 

The second-row seating in the G06 is designed as a rear seat bench with the usual 40:20:40 split and 
mechanically folding backrests. The backrests are folded by means of the release mechanism on the 
respective backrest itself or via the release handle in the luggage compartment. 

The outer seats have the same decor as the driver's and front passenger seats. The contour of the 
outer seats also adopt the design of the front seats and lend the rear seat bench a sporty character. 
The head restraints are integrated in the backrest and are non-adjustable. The center armrest with 
integrated cupholder familiar from the G05 is already included in the standard equipment.

(SA ZDY). 

The Assisted Driving View visualizes the behavior of the individual driver assistance systems. This 
enables the customer to identify the status and the limits of the driver assistance systems more easily. 
The new transparent display increases confidence in the driver assistance systems. The upshot of 
increased confidence is that the customer uses the assisted and semi-automated driving systems 
more frequently. 

The fundamental principles here are: 


View - See what the vehicle actually sees. 

Intention - See what coming action the vehicle is planning.

Too many details in a display can distract from the actual function. In addition, the customer's 
expectations with regard to the performance of the driver assistance systems increase. Too high a 
degree of detail can lead to the miscalculation that the vehicle offers a higher level of automation. The 
representation of the Assisted Driving View is kept abstract for this reason. The degree of detail is 
chosen in such a way that the current status of the driver assistance systems is shown appropriately. 

The display of information on the surroundings may be accompanied by errors caused by sensors and 
their limits. 



The general view of the Assisted Driving View is not trouble-free. The driver remains responsible for 
controlling and directing the vehicle. 


The emphasis of the Assisted Driving View is not on showing all the data acquired by the sensors, but 
instead on supporting the driver. Therefore objects that are not relevant to the driving situation are 
filtered out. 

7.4.2. System activation 

The Assisted Driving View can be activated in Drive by means of the following settings: 

• "Display settings" 

• “Instrument cluster” 

• "Central display area"

Assisted Driving View 


The Assisted Driving View consists of a basic scene, animations and additional elements. The basic 
scene is always shown when Assisted Driving View is activated.

Horizon 


The horizon serves to provide a perspective view. 

The driver's own (subject) vehicle is shown statically in the display. The surface grid is moved to 
simulate vehicle movement. This enables both fast and slow movements (forward and reverse) of the 
subject vehicle to be shown. 

The neighboring lanes to the left and right of the actual lane are superimposed in and removed from 
the display on the basis of their relevance. A time offset may be experienced in the display at the 
beginning/end of a neighboring lane. The aim is to superimpose the neighboring lanes only if the lanes 
are required for the current driving situation. Hard shoulders are only displayed if the hard shoulders 
are used for a limited time in heavy traffic. In all other driving situations the hard shoulders are not 
shown. 

Oncoming lanes are not shown apart from display errors. Road junctions, curves and intersecting 
roads are not shown either.

A selection of other road users can be shown in the Assisted Driving View. The selection is based on 
the relevance to acceleration/deceleration and the lane change of the subject vehicle. The scenario is 
subdivided into 5 sectors for this purpose. Each sector can contain one road user.

More than 5 road users may be depicted briefly in the event of overlapping animations. The display is 
basically limited to 5 road users. Apart from lane changes, road users are always shown in the middle 
of their lane. 

Other road users are subdivided into 3 object types so as to be able to tell them apart on the basis of 
their size. The object types are: 

• Car 

• Truck 

• Motorcycle 

The displayed size of the objects does not correspond to their actual size. Car and motorcycle models 
are displayed irrespective of the real size of the actual road users. Due to the great differences in 
length of trucks, an approximated representation of truck models to the real length of the road users is 
provided. Appropriate distances can thereby be visualized. 


28 







G06 Complete Vehicle 

7. Driver Assistance Systems 

Like the road users in sectors 1 to 5, the subject vehicle is shown in the middle of its lane. In the 
following driving situations the real transverse position of the subject vehicle in relation to the actual 
lane is displayed: 

• When assisted (lane change assistant) or manual lane changes are performed on roads with 
lane markings. 

• When the driver consciously deviates from the middle of the lane while the steering and lane 
control assistant is activated. 

• When the lane departure warning with lane return responds and the subject vehicle is returned 
to a safe position. 


Limits of the system 

The depiction of other road users and lanes is restricted by the limits of the sensors. Incorrect 
displays may therefore occur (incorrect lanes, incorrect objects or placements, missing elements). 
The neighboring lanes are blanked in the low speed range to reduce incorrect displays. This 
reduces implausible displays. When the vehicle is being driven with the Active Cruise Control 
with Stop&Go function only the subject lane with the vehicle travelling in front is then visible. To 
facilitate understanding the blanking always relates to the driver's own speed. The same blanking of 
neighboring lanes is also displayed when driving with Park Distance Control (PDC) or in reverse gear 
since Assisted Driving View is not designed to visualize the parking manoeuvre. 


In the Assisted Driving View any depictions of collisions between the subject vehicle and other road 
users are avoided since this can lead to driver irritation. Sensor limits could lead to the incorrect 


display of collisions which in reality do not happen. To prevent this from happening, other road users 
close to the subject vehicle are first displayed transparently and then removed. Transparent display 
and removal from the display are performed on the basis of the relative speed to the subject vehicle. 
This logic can give rise, for example in tight overtaking manoeuvres, to transparent road users in 
the Assisted Driving View. The target object of the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function is 
excluded from this logic.

Due to statutory provisions the Assisted Driving Plus function is for the time being only available in the 
USA, Canada, China and Japan. Accordingly, its depiction via the Assisted Driving View function is 
only available in these national-market versions. 

7.4.9. Latency monitoring 

Delays (so-called latency) may be encountered in the signal chain from the sensor to visualization in 
the Assisted Driving View; for example, when the head unit is subject to extremely high load such as 
during a software update. For legal reasons the latency must not exceed a defined threshold value. 
This prevents the risk of inaccurate visualizations which suggest an incorrect status on the part of the 
driver assistance systems. The latency is monitored in order to comply with the legal provisions. 

The Assisted Driving View is removed from the display if the latency exceeds the predefined threshold 
value. The central display area initially remains black. The visualization is continued only when the 
latency drops below the threshold value under stable conditions. If there is no stabilization over a 
defined period, the content of the central display area switches to the set alternative display. The 
alternative display is found in the "Central display area" settings. 

7.4.10. Navigation 

When the Assisted Driving View is activated, the large navigation display in the central display area of 
the instrument cluster is omitted. Direction arrows continued to be displayed in the Assisted Driving 
View. When navigation mode is active the navigation display can be provided via the CID or optionally 
via the BMW Head-Up Display (SA 610).

7.4.11. Speed Limit Assistant 

The Speed Limit Assistant function supports the driver by adopting the speed limits. This was first 
introduced on the G05 

Manual adoption of the speed limit is executed via the SET button.

With Speed Limit Assistant the speed limit can be adopted, after driver confirmation, as the new set 
speed when the cruise control is activated. 

Manual adoption of the upcoming speed limit must be activated in the iDrive menu and can also be 
configured and deactivated in the same place. Manual adoption is executed by pressing the "SET 
button" on the multifunction steering wheel (MFL). Automatic adoption of the upcoming speed limit 
is not available for the US market.
