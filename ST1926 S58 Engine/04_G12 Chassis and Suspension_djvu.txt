The following optional equipment is available in addition to the basic chassis and suspension: 

• Integral Active Steering 

• Active Comfort Drive 

Both equipment options can be combined with each other and are available for all drive variants (also 
xDrive). It was possible to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions and increase the control dynamics 
through complete electrification of the two optional equipment systems. In the customer's perception, 
this is expressed in a lower fuel consumption with increased comfort as well as a sportier driving 
feeling. 

The driver can influence the control characteristics of the different suspension control systems 
by means of the driving experience switch. Further information on this is provided in the Technical 
Training Manual “G12 Driver Assistance Systems”.

2.1. Front axle 

The double-wishbone front axle offers optimum alignment of the camber of the front wheels in relation 
to the roadway in every driving situation. During the compression and rebound movements, a wheel 
therefore always has exactly the camber value that guarantees optimum transfer of cornering forces in 
relation to the roadway. This ensures excellent tire contact with the road and the tire is able to transfer 
high lateral forces. The attainable high lateral acceleration forces are thus possible without 
the otherwise necessary firm chassis and suspension setup. 

With the double-wishbone front axle, the shock absorber does not perform any wheel control tasks. 
This means that the shock absorber are practically free of lateral forces and can react sensitively to 
road bumps. 

Since the double-wishbone front axle has a small kinematic lever arm, disturbance variables such 
as road joints or potholes generate only a small torque about the steering axis. 

The sum of all advantages means that the double-wishbone front axle makes it possible to resolve 
the conflict of goals between comfort and sportiness.

In order to achieve the lowest possible vehicle weight, the front axle components are made almost 
completely from aluminium. 

The design of the double-wishbone front axle offers the following advantages: 


• High agility due to absorption of high lateral acceleration forces. 

• Outstanding roll stabilization when cornering without any reduction in ride comfort. 

• Comfortable, good spring response of the axle and good directional stability. 

• High comfort due to minimum influence of disturbance variables. 

In addition to ensuring driving dynamics and ride comfort, the double-wishbone front axle also 
performs various crash functions. The front axle support is part of the crash structure of the body 
and forms an additional load path. This ensures that the increased requirements relating to 
pedestrian protection are met. 

A_ 

Driving without a stiffening plate is not permitted due to the resultant lack of vehicle stability.

The five-link rear axle of the G12 is characterized by precise wheel guidance, which comes into its own 
in various driving situations, such as during load reversals or the transition from cornering to straight¬ 
ahead driving. In addition, the five-link rear axle offers very high comfort in combination with sporty 
driving dynamics. 

It was possible to resolve this conflict of goals by means of the following measures: 

• Double flexible rear-axle rubber mounts 

• High structural rigidity of the rear axle support 

• Large support area of the rear axle support 

It was possible to keep the unsprung masses of the five-link rear axle low through the use of an 
aluminium wheel carrier as well as various forged aluminium and sheet steel control arms. 

Clever definition of the kinematic points as well as precise design of the ball joints and rubber mounts 
result in a large spring travel range in combination with optimum wheel guidance. The small acting 
lever arms ensure particularly good insensitivity to bumps in the road. The extremely rigid control arms 
as well as the torsion-free rear axle support and body connections realized by means of compression 
struts result in extremely precise wheel guidance. 

The air deflectors under the control arms minimise swirl and thus increase the efficiency of the vehicle.

On the G12, no centering mountings are used on the body for alignment of the rear axle. This makes 
it possible to ensure during assembly that the rubber mounts of the rear axle are screwed to the body 
completely without any tension. Bumps in the road are isolated and are not transmitted to the body 
due to direct contact of the rubber mounts. 

New special tools are used for removal and assembly of the rear axle support. The rear axle support is 
held in the correct position for installation by means of 2 guide pins. For the detailed procedure, refer 
to the current repair instructions.

G12 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Air Suspension 

In order to guarantee uniform ride comfort independently of the load status, the G12 is equipped as 
standard with air suspension on the front and rear axles. The two-axle ride level control of the G12 is 
offered only in combination with electrically controlled shock absorbers. 

The air suspension increases the ride comfort. The system performs adjustment mainly at standstill, 
e.g. in order to compensate for a change in height due to the vehicle load. The inertia of the system 
means that it cannot react to driving dynamics disturbance variables, which may occur when the 
vehicle is driven quickly on twisting roads. Dynamic control when driving serves only to compensate 
for changes in height due to a falling fuel tank volume as well as temperature changes of the air in the 
air suspension struts. 

The air suspension offers the following advantages: 

• Increase in driving safety, since the self-levelling suspension automatically keeps the height of 
the vehicle body at a predefined nominal ride-level in all load states. 

• High ride comfort due to automatic adaptation of the oscillation behavior to the vehicle weight. 

• Increased customer benefit through manual level adjustment by means of the ride height 
selection switch.

The central control unit for controlling the air suspension is the Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP). 

The Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) control unit reads in the current ride height values by means of 
the 4 ride height sensors. The Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) activates the solenoid valves of the 
solenoid valve block in order to perform control actions. 

Control actions at standstill and at low vehicle speeds (0 - 20 km/h / 0- 12 mph) are achieved by using 
the storage volume of the two pressure accumulators. For control actions when driving (> 20 km/h / 
>12 mph), the required compressed air is not taken from the pressure accumulator, but is generated 
by the compressor and forwarded directly to the corresponding air suspension struts. In exceptional 
situations, the compressor can also be switched on when the vehicle is at standstill. 

The increase in volume in the air suspension strut lifts the vehicle body. Achievement of the nominal 
ride-level height is detected by the 4 ride height sensors and activation of the corresponding solenoid 
valves is interrupted. Three-point control is used for processing in order to avoid frequent re¬ 
adjustment. The rear axle is controlled individually by means of both ride height sensors. In the case 
of the front axle, the corresponding ride height is adjusted on the basis of a mean value. 

The compressed air lines have different colors in order to avoid confusion during servicing work on the 
solenoid valve block. The following table contains an overview of the color codes.

3.1. Air supply system 

The air supply system is made up of the following components: 

• Electrical compressor 

• Solenoid valve block 

• Holder with vibration damper 

The air supply system has the task of generating the required compressed air and coordinating the 
air flows between the electrical compressor, pressure accumulators and the 4 air suspension struts 
corresponding to the requirements. The calculations required for this are performed by the Vertical 
Dynamics Platform (VDP). 

For package reasons, the system comprises two separate pressure accumulators with a total volume 
of 6 liters and a maximum storage pressure of 17.5 bar. A total volume of 105 liters is available to the 
system at maximum pressure.

The electrical compressor is switched via a relay. The relay is activated by the Vertical Dynamics 
Platform (VDP). In order to prevent vibrations from being transmitted into the vehicle interior when the 
compressor is running, the air supply system is secured to the vehicle body by means of a holder with 
vibration dampers. 

To prevent the driver from being irritated by the start-up noises of the compressor, this is switched on 
almost exclusively while driving. The compressor can also be switched on at vehicle standstill if the 
following preconditions are all met: 

• Vehicle condition Residing/Awake 

• Sufficient vehicle voltage 

• Ride height - 40 mm of the initializes value 

• Insufficient pressure in the pressure accumulator for control 

The intake air is cleaned by the air cleaner upstream of the compressor and dried by the air drier 
downstream of the compressor. Cleaning is necessary so that the valves are protected against 
soiling. The water is extracted from the air in order to protect the valves against icing at low ambient 
temperatures. If the valves were to freeze due to excessively high air humidity in the air supply system, 
this would mean that level control by the air suspension would no longer be possible. To avoid this, 
the air drier is permanently cleaned or dried. 

The granulate in the air drier absorbs moisture at high pressure and gives this off again at low 
pressure. The moisture is extracted from the air when air flows through the granulate when filling the 
system. When the vehicle height is lowered, the excess air with low pressure is routed through the air 
drier. The stored moisture is then give off to the air again as it flows past. This permanent regeneration 
of the air drier ensures fault-free operation of the system without the need for maintenance work.

Sensor signal output (pressure sensor) 


The different electrical solenoid valves are located in the solenoid valve block. These are used 
to forward the compressed air to the different components of the air suspension. The required 
calculations for control of the electrical solenoid valves take place in the Vertical Dynamics Platform 
(VDP) control unit. 

The following control speeds can be achieved for axle-based changes in the ride height 
by the system: 

• Control via the pressure accumulators ~ 10 mm/s 

• Control via the electrical compressor ~ 2 mm/s 

An advantage of the installation position of the pressure sensor is that the filling pressures of the 
pressure accumulators and air suspension struts can be read in with only one sensor depending 
on activation. 

When the electrical solenoid valve of the pressure accumulators is activated, a pressure sensor 
supplies information about the current filling pressure of the system to the Vertical Dynamics Platform 
(VDP) control unit. If the stored pressure is not sufficient for a pending change in ride height, the 
Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) control unit switches on the compressor for pressure build-up. 
However, the compressor is switched on only subject to certain preconditions when the vehicle is at 
standstill so that comfort is not impaired (see Air supply system). 

In the event of activation of the solenoid valves for operation of the air suspension struts, the pressure 
sensor supplies the filling pressures of the corresponding air suspension struts. 


3.2. Air suspension strut 

The height of the vehicle body is automatically controlled via the pressure in the air suspension strut in 
all load states. This prevents the vehicle body from sinking when the vehicle is loaded. The air supply 
for the air suspension struts is provided by an electrically driven compressor and 2 air accumulators. 
The air suspension thus functions independently of the operating condition of the combustion engine 
and can also compensate uneven loading (e.g. sloping load) by individual wheel control on the rear 
axle.

On the air suspension strut, the coil spring is replaced by a U-type bellows. The air is pressed into the 
air suspension strut via a compressed air connection. The U-type bellows of the air suspension strut 
unrolls as a result of the pressure increase and raises the vehicle body. When the air suspension strut 
is vented, the pressure falls and the U-type bellows rolls up again so that the vehicle body is lowered.

There is a residual pressure holding valve inside the pneumatic connections to prevent complete 
pressure reduction in the air suspension strut. A residual pressure of 1.8 - 2.7 bar is held when the 
compressed air lines are removed.

The pneumatic connections with integrated residual holding valve on the air suspension strut cannot

In the speed range between 0-40 km/h 10 - 25 mph, the High level (+ 20 mm) can be activated 
manually via the ride height selection switch. This ride height setting is intended to allow the driver 
to drive over shoulders or ramps with a large gradient angle without damaging the vehicle due to the 
increased ground clearance. The following ride heights are set automatically if this speed range is 
exceeded. 

1 If the driving experience switch is in Comfort position, the ride height is lowered 
to Normal level (+/- 0 mm). 

2 If the driving experience switch is in Sport position, the ride height is lowered 
to Sport level (-10 mm).

When a driving speed of ~ 140 km/h / ~ 87 mph is exceeded, the vehicle body is automatically lowered 
from Normal level to Sport level (-10 mm) independently of the respective switch settings. Lowering to

Sport level (-10 mm) offers the highest driving dynamics of all ride heights due to the low vehicle 
center of gravity. The fuel consumption also falls due to the improved aerodynamics. 


3.5. Notes for Service 

Complete (100%) tightness of the air suspension cannot be guaranteed due to the numerous flexible 
compressed air lines with the corresponding compressed air connections. A defined low loss of 
compressed air is therefore permissible. If the vehicle is parked at Normal level, the ride height may be 
lowered by up to a maximum of - 2 mm after 24 hours. This means that the ride height may be lowered 
by up to - 60 mm for a vehicle that has been parked for 30 days without there being a fault caused by a 
leak. 



Side view of the G12 with air suspension lowered to maximum extent 


Since components do not all leak to the same extent for tolerance reasons, it is also possible that the 
vehicle will be sloping at an angle after a prolonged standstill time. 

Low and sloping vehicle positions are automatically compensated by the air suspension after 
detection of the vehicle condition Residing/Awake. For this purpose, the missing compressed air is 
forwarded to the corresponding spring struts by the pressure accumulator. If the filling pressure of 
the pressure accumulators is too low, the lack of air is compensated by switching on the electrical 
compressor. 

The following scenarios for activation of the electrical compressor are possible: 

1 If the ride height is less than - 40 mm, the compressor will be switched on only when 
the engine is running. 

2 If the ride height is more than - 40 mm and the vehicle electrical system has sufficient 
voltage, the compressor will already be switched on when the vehicle condition 
Residing/Awake is detected. 


3.5.1. Lifting the vehicle 

The air suspension has a jack detection function. This prevents control action of the air suspension 
when the vehicle is lifted. 


36 



G12 Chassis and Suspension 

3. Air Suspension 

3.5.2. Transport mode 

The air suspension is in transport mode when new vehicles are delivered. A change in the ride height 
is not possible. Transport mode must be deleted using the BMW diagnosis system ISTA during 
the pre-delivery check. The different ride heights of the air suspension can be selected only after 
successful start-up of the air suspension (transport mode deleted). 

3.5.3. Bleeding the air suspension 

When working on components of the air suspension system, it is necessary to depressurize the 
system before undoing the various compressed air lines. This can be done using the BMW diagnosis 
system ISTA by means of a bleeding routine. Here, the various solenoid valves of the air suspension 
struts and the electrical drain solenoid valve are activated simultaneously. In order to protect the valves 
against overheating, the bleeding routine cannot be performed an arbitrary number of times 
in succession. However, the function is available again after a defined waiting period. 

A 

In order to avoid damage to the air suspension struts, the vehicle should be raised slightly using 
a vehicle hoist during the bleeding routine. 


However, it is not recommended to completely lift the vehicle during the bleeding routine as this 
hampers complete emptying of the compressed air from the air suspension struts. 

3.5.4. Filling the air suspension 

The system is filled automatically via the vehicle's electrical compressor as soon as the marginal 
conditions for this are met. In order to perform a leakage test of the air suspension in Service, the 
electrical compressor can be switched on manually to fill the system using the BMW diagnosis 
system ISTA. If the air suspension is filled several times, the electrical compressor may be 
switched off to prevent the compressor from being damaged.

4.2. Parking brake 

The BMW E65/E66 (BMW 7 Series from 2001 - 2008) was the first production vehicle in the world 
with an electromechanical parking brake EMF. This was followed by many other BMW models with 
different electrical parking brake systems. 

The following advantages result from the use of such a system: 

• More storage space due to omission of a parking brake lever and parking brake Bowden cable. 

• Contact pressure of brake pads correctly adjusted at all times. 

• Various additional functions to assist the driver (e.g. automatic release when driving off). 

• Higher braking power of auxiliary brake system. 

The following 2 different electrical systems are currently used at BMW: 

• Electromechanical parking brake = Cable pull system via duo-servo parking 
brake (Kuster system). 

• Electric parking brake = Combined brake caliper (TRW/Continental system).

Central gateway module 


In contrast to the cable pull system in the F01/F02, the electric parking brake system with a combined 
brake caliper familiar from the smaller series is used in the G12. 

Previously, the parking brake was realized by means of a duo-servo parking brake in the heavy upper 
class vehicles. The advantage of this system is the high self-locking force of the brake pads when the 
parking brake is applied. 

Due to the increase in the preload forces of the combined brake caliper with electric parking brake, 
it was possible to dispense with the previously used cable pull system in the G12. Omission of the 
associated components is beneficial for weight reduction and also for the repair friendliness of the 
G12. 

The electric parking brake of the G12 is differentiated above all by the fact that there is no separate 
control unit. The electric parking brake is activated via the control unit of the Dynamic Stability Control 
(DSC). There is a parking brake button on the center console for activating or deactivating the electric 
parking brake. The driver is informed about the current system status via the instrument cluster 
KOMBI. 

The brake pad is applied with a precisely calculated preload force via two actuators screwed onto 
the brake calipers. A temperature model is stored in the DSC control unit which makes it possible to 
draw conclusions about the brake disc temperatures. As the contact pressure decreases when the 
brake discs cool down, the system must adjust the brake pads as appropriate, particularly if the brake 
discs are hot. The time and frequency of the adjustment varies depending on the initial temperature 
calculated. 

When the electric parking brake is opened, the actuators are moved back only until the brake pads 
have reached their correctly set clearance. Due to this readjustment function, the actuators must be 
moved back before exchanging the brake pads in Service. For the detailed procedure, refer to the 
current repair instructions.

Electric motor (DC) 


There is an electric motor with belt drive and planetary gear on the housing of the combined brake 
caliper with electric parking brake. When the electric motor is activated, the force is transmitted via the 
belt drive and planetary gear to the spindle nut. The spindle nut generates the required stroke to apply 
the brake pad. The control unit of the Dynamic Stability Control can determine the preload force on the 
basis of the rise in current of the electric motor. 

When carrying out servicing work, an extended spindle nut can be travelled back to its initial position 
as follows: 

• Special tool for mechanically turning back 

• Service function “Workshop mode” in the BMW diagnosis system ISTA 


4.2.1. Functions 

Dynamic emergency braking 

If the parking brake button is operated during the journey above a defined driving speed, the DSC unit 
initiates a dynamic emergency braking operation. A pressure build-up occurs in all 4 wheel brakes 
due to activation of the 6-piston pump and the changeover valves in the DSC unit. The slip limits of all 
wheels are monitored with the assistance of the four wheel speed sensors to ensure a stable braking 


47 










G12 Chassis and Suspension

operation until the vehicle comes to a standstill. The two actuators of the electric parking brake are 
activated as soon as the vehicle comes to a standstill. The vehicle is then secured to prevent it from 
rolling away only by means of the parking brake. 

Automatic release of the parking brake 

This function allows the driver to drive off when the parking brake is activated without operating the 
parking brake button to release the brake. 

Prerequisites for releasing the electric parking brake: 

• Driver's door is closed 

• Vehicle condition DRIVING 

• Electric parking brake actuated 

• Drive position engaged 

• Accelerator pedal operated 


4.2.2. Brake test stand 

The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) has a roller mode so that the braking power of the electric 
parking brake can be checked on a brake test stand. When roller mode is activated, the vehicle is 
braked via the actuators of the electric parking brake when the parking brake button is pressed. A DSC 
pressure build-up in the 4 wheel brakes does not take place. This makes it possible to determine the 
brake forces of the electric parking brake. 

In the G12, roller mode is automatically detected on the basis of a plausibility check (wheel speed 
comparison). The detection takes a maximum of 5 seconds (can be recognized by slow flashing of the 
red parking brake indicator light). 

After activation of test stand mode the system is in test stand mode. This condition is acknowledged 
by the indicator light of the parking brake starting to flash at a frequency of 1 Hz. The parking brake 
can be applied in 5 stages using the parking brake button. In this case, the braking varies between 
the minimum braking power in the first stage and the maximum braking power once the parking brake 
button has been pressed five times. If the button is operated continuously, the system increases the 
braking power automatically incrementally up to the maximum braking power. The flashing frequency 
of the parking brake indicator light changes from 1 Hz to 3 Hz when the parking brake button is 
pressed in test stand mode. 

The following points must be observed during the test: 

• Do not press the accelerator 

• Drive position N (neutral) 

• Do not press the footbrake

4. Brakes 


Before the wear limit of the brake pad is reached, the sensor wire of the one-stage brake pad wear 
sensor is cut through by the rotating brake disc while driving. As from this point, the vehicle status of 
the brake pads can be checked on the Central Information Display (CID). The remaining distance until 
the wear limit of the brake pad is reached is 4000 - 5000 km / 2500 - 3100 miles, depending on driving 
style. 

In addition, the driver is informed about the condition of the brake pads by means of the following 
warnings.

The current repair instructions must always be observed in order to avoid interference noises after 
brake pad replacement. 


4.3.2. Parking brake 

Replacing brake pads 

In order to replace the brake pads of the rear parking brake calipers, it is first necessary to turn back 
the drive spindle in the brake caliper. This can be done either manually using a special tool or using the 
BMW diagnosis system ISTA. The parking brake button is blocked to prevent use after activation of 
workshop mode via the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. This prevents injury during the brake service. 
The parking brake button is enabled again at the start of driving or after exiting workshop mode. 

After enabling via the speed threshold of 3 km/h /1.8 mph, the parking brake must be re-initialized by 
button operation (apply/release brake). 

Emergency release 

It is possible to mechanically turn back the drive spindle to release the parking brake after removing 
the actuator housing from the brake caliper. To prevent accidents, the vehicle must first be secured to 
prevent it from rolling away. 

A_ 

Emergency release of the electric parking brake is permitted only by correspondingly trained 
personnel.

Run-flat tires 


In the event of tire pressure loss in a run-flat tire, the customer can still drive at a restricted speed (max. 
80 km/h / 50 mph) for a remaining distance that is dependent on the vehicle load. On vehicles with the 
optional chassis and suspension package “Active Comfort Drive”, the vehicle weight is automatically 
distributed via the active electric stabilizers when driving with an unpressurised run-flat tire so that 
the unpressurised wheel (< 0.5 bar) is relieved to the maximum possible extent and the intact wheels 
loaded correspondingly. This ensures that the maximum possible remaining distance can be driven. 
The maximum permitted remaining distance with medium load is 80 kilometres / 50 miles. 

Further information on the function of the active electric stabilizer is provided in the section 
“Autobahan Package”. 

A damaged run-flat tire can also be replaced by a tire without emergency running properties in the 
event of tire failure. However, the tire without emergency running properties must be replaced at the 
earliest opportunity by a run-flat tire.

The G12 is equipped with the RDCi already familiar from the FI 5. The RDCi is a system which 
performs direct measurement and which determines the real tire pressures by means of wheel 
electronics in each wheel. Unlike with the RDC low, a separate RDC control unit is not required for the 
RDCi. The functions of the RDCi are integrated into the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) control unit. 
The remote control receiver (FBD) acts as a receiver for the sent reports of all wheel electronics. It then 
forwards this information via bus to the DSC control unit. 

The previous RDCi systems were supplied by Continental. The system supplier of the RDCi in the G12 
is the company Schrader. In order to ensure fault-free operation of the system, it is essential that only 
Schrader wheel electronics are used. It is not possible to assume any liability for malfunctions with 
third-party wheel electronics. 

On the G12, the rest times required by the system before the new wheel electronics can be taught, 
have changed. Previously, a vehicle with RDCi had to be stationary for an uninterrupted period of at 
least 8 minutes independently of the terminal status before the DSC control unit accepted the IDs 
of the new wheel electronics. 

On the G12, the vehicle condition is decisive for the times required by the system before the IDs 
of new wheel electronics are accepted and taught. The following table provides an overview of the 
different conditions.

So that new wheel electronics can be taught by the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), a standing 
time of at least 5 minutes (Residing/Awake) or 17 minutes (driving) must be observed after a wheel 
exchange. 


If the standing time of at least 5 minutes (Residing/Awake) or 17 minutes (driving) was not reached 
before starting a journey with new wheel electronics, a Check Control message will be displayed to 
the driver after a certain time. In this case, the vehicle must only remain stationary for an uninterrupted 
period of longer than 5 minutes in Residing/Awake mode or 17 minutes in Driving mode. The new 
wheel electronics will then be automatically taught by the control unit of the Dynamic Stability Control 
(DSC).

The vehicle can also be in the vehicle condition Driving when the engine has been switched off by the 
automatic engine start-stop function MSA.

The system must be re-initialized in the event of changes in the tire pressures as well as after wheel 
exchange. Initialization of the new tire pressures can be performed using the controller on the Central 
Information Display (CID). 


5.2.1. Wheel electronics 



Wheel electronics from Schrader in the G12 


The wheel electronics are in the following modes, depending on the system status: 

• Sleep mode 

• Teach-in mode 

• Readiness mode 

There are also changes in the transmission modes of the Schrader wheel electronics in comparison 
with the transmission modes of the wheel electronics from Continental. In order to guarantee the 
longest possible battery capacity, the wheel electronics require longer standing times before they 
switch to teach-in mode. 

After 15 minutes in rest mode (wheel standstill), the wheel electronics start to transmit in teach-in 
mode as soon as they are accelerated to a speed faster than around 20 km/h. In teach-in mode, the 
reports are sent to the DSC control unit every 15 seconds for approximately 9 minutes (40 reports). 
Transmission in teach-in mode allows the DSC control unit to calculate the installation position of the 
respective wheel electronics. The wheel electronics will start to transmit in readiness mode if a wheel 


54 






G12 Chassis and Suspension 

5. Wheels / Tires 


set was changed from one vehicle to another without the wheel set having been in rest mode (wheel 
standstill) for an uninterrupted period of more than 15 minutes. Teaching of the wheel electronics is 
not possible in readiness mode. 

Balancing of the wheel set shortly before fitting on the vehicle is not a problem. Since only a small 
number of reports are transmitted in teach-in mode during balancing, the remaining reports are 
sufficient to reliably teach the wheel electronics. 

The battery status of the wheel electronics can be read out via the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 
The remaining battery life is specified in percent. 

Detailed information on the operating principle of the RDCi is provided in the Training Reference 
Manual “101 Complete Vehicle”.

6.1. Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

Alongside the Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) control unit, the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 
represents the core element of the driving dynamics control systems used to increase active safety. It 
optimizes driving stability in all driving conditions and also traction when driving off and accelerating. 
It also identifies unstable driving conditions such as understeering or oversteering and helps maintain 
the vehicle on a steady course.

The DSC control unit and the DSC hydraulic control unit are screwed together. The DSC control unit 
can be replaced individually to reduce servicing costs. 

In older series, the different driving dynamics systems are connected via the Integrated Chassis 
Management (ICM) control unit. The control unit of the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) in the G12 
has an additional storage element (black box) in which some of the functions of the Integrated Chassis 
Management (ICM) are stored. The different driving dynamics control systems are coordinated 
perfectly by means of the algorithms stored in the black box. 

The functions of the tire pressure control (RDC) and electric parking brake (EPB) were integrated in the 
DSC control unit.

Different DSC versions are used depending on the drive type and equipment range. In the hybrid 
version, there is an additional brake pedal travel sensor on the footbrake lever. 

If the vehicle is equipped with the optional equipment “Active cruise control with Stop & Go function”, 
there are 2 additional pressure sensors in the hydraulic unit. 

6.1.2. Functions 

The following table provides an overview of the different functions of the DSC unit. 


Function 

Explanation 

Antilock Brake System 
(ABS) 

Prevents blocking of individual wheels when braking through targeted 
modulation of the brake pressures. Vehicle steerability is maintained. 

Dynamic Stability 
Control (DSC) 

If the vehicle starts to understeer or oversteer, it is stabilized by targeted 
brake interventions at individual wheels. 

Dynamic Traction 
Control (DTC) 

This is a special mode of the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). 

In interaction with ASC and DSC, this mode features extended 
intervention thresholds and permits an even sportier driving style 
without interventions on normal surfaces as well as maximum 
propulsion on loose ground such as snow, sand or coarse gravel. 

Cornering Brake 

Control (CBC) 

Prevents the vehicle from turning in when it is braked lightly under high 
lateral acceleration forces by means of asymmetrical control of the brake 
pressure. The cornering stability is improved. 

Automatic Stability 
Control (ASC) 

Prevents the drive wheels from spinning by targeted braking of these 
wheels and adaptation of the drive torque delivered by the engine. 

Vehicle propulsion is optimized as a result and driving stability is 
maintained. 

Dynamic Brake 

Control (DBC) 

In the event of panic braking initiated by the driver, the system supports 
the driver by automatically immediately applying the maximum brake 
pressure to ensure the best possible deceleration. 

Automatic Differential 
Brake (ADB-X) 

Replicates the function of a differential lock. If a wheel displays a 
tendency to spin, this wheel is automatically braked so that propulsion 
can still be achieved via the other wheel of the driven axle. 

Trailer stabilization 
control 

Automatically detects when a vehicle with trailer is starting to snake, 
stabilizes the outfit by targeted brake interventions and simultaneously 
decelerates it to an uncritical speed for snaking. 


62 












G12 Chassis and Suspension 

6. Driving Stability Control 


Function 

Explanation 

Brake standby 

Builds up a moderate brake pressure in the system when the driver takes 
his foot off the accelerator pedal very quickly. The brake pads are applied 
slightly as a result. The braking effect then acts more quickly if the driver 
then performs panic braking. 

Dry by applying brake 

Depending on operation of the wiper, applies the brake pads gently at 
intervals in order to dry the brake discs. The braking effect is significantly 
improved by this when the vehicle is braked. 

Fading support 

Supports the driver when braking if the brake temperature has become 
very high due to an extreme driving style and the desired deceleration 
can be achieved only by applying a higher brake force. 

Drive-off assistant 

Holds the vehicle for approximately 1.5 s on uphill gradients when the 
driver releases the brake to drive off. This allows the driver to drive off 
comfortably without the vehicle rolling away on its own. 

Automatic Hold 

Automatically holds the vehicle after it has come to a standstill without 
it being necessary to still press the brake when the drive position is 
selected. The brake is automatically released when the accelerator pedal 
is pressed and the vehicle drives away normally. The function can be 
switched on and off by means of a button. 


A 


If a trailer tow hitch is retrofitted, the function “trailer stabilization logic” must be encoded in the DSC 
control unit.

In addition to the pure support function, the front wheels can in principle be made to perform any 
steering movement independently of the manual torque applied at the steering wheel. This system is 
therefore a prerequisite for realization of a large number of assistance functions such as the Parking 
Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA). 

The Electronic Power Steering (EPS) permits a reduction in the average fuel consumption of 
approximately 0.3 I per 100 km / 62 miles. A further advantage is that no oil is needed for steering 
assistance.

The rear axle slip angle control (HSR) mounted on the rear angle permits a maximum steering angle of 
the rear wheels of +/- 3°. As a result, it was possible to reduce the turning circle by approximately 1 m 
in comparison with vehicles without rear axle slip angle control (HSR). The rear axle slip angle control is 
available from a speed of approximately 5 km/h / 3 mph up to the maximum speed. 

The request to adjust the steering angle at the rear axle is issued by the Dynamic Stability Control 
(DSC). A spindle drive inside the component is rotated via the electric motor. This produces a linear 
movement at the two track control arms. Using the position sensor, the control unit of the rear axle 
slip angle control (HSR) can determine the linear displacement and thus calculate the steering angle 
of the two rear axle wheels. 

The spindle drive of the rear axle slip angle control (HSR) is self-inhibiting. This means that the vehicle 
has the identical drivability to a vehicle without rear axle slip angle control (HSR) in the event of system 
failure.

A special fixture is required for alignment in order to assemble the carrier plates. This is not available 
in Service. For this reason, the carrier plates on the rear axle slip angle control (HSR) must not be 
undone. If this is not observed, the wheel alignment on the rear axle will become incorrectly adjusted.

Opposite steering

In the speed range up to approximately 60 km/h / 37 mph, the rear axle slip angle control (HSR) steers 
in the opposite direction to the steering angles of the front axle steering. This permits increased 
vehicle manoeuvrability. 

As from the speed range of approximately 60 km/h / 37 mph, the rear axle slip angle control (HSR) 
steers in the same direction. This improves the directional stability of the vehicle.

6. Driving Stability Control 

Driving dynamics control interventions when cornering 

When changing lanes quickly, all vehicles have a tendency to produce a significant yaw response and 
can sometimes start to oversteer. If the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) detects a deviation between 
the driver wish and vehicle response, the vehicle is stabilized by means of a steering intervention at 
the rear axle. The speed of the stabilizing intervention is such that it is hardly discernible by the driver. 
It is possible to largely do without decelerating DSC brake interventions. As a result, the vehicle is 
more stable and the driving dynamics are preserved.

If the driver underestimates a bend when driving rapidly, he may be surprised by sudden understeer. 
The rear axle slip angle control (HSR) can also perform a corrective intervention in understeer 
situations and thus additional increases active safety.

Driving dynamics control on different surfaces 

Hard braking manoeuvres on roadways that are slippery on one side make the vehicle yaw to the 
vehicle side with more grip. In the event of emergency braking, the driver of a conventional vehicle 
must take corrective action. With this so-called p-split braking, the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 
provides a stabilizing yaw moment via a steering intervention at the rear axle.

Further to A) Without DSC 

When braking with a vehicle without DSC, maximum brake force is supported on the dry side of the 
road and only low brake force on the wet or icy side. An anti-clockwise yaw moment is produced which 
can lead to the vehicle skidding to the right. 

Further to B) With DSC 

When braking with a vehicle equipped with DSC, the brake forces at the wheels are metered so 
that the yaw moment acting on the vehicle is reduced. The vehicle therefore remains controllable. 

The stopping distance may be increased slightly.

6. Driving Stability Control 

Further to C) With DSC and rear axle slip angle control (HSR) 

When braking with a vehicle equipped with DSC and rear axle slip angle control (HSR) (optional 
equipment Integral Active Steering SA 2VH), the DSC control unit calculates the steering angle for 
the rear wheels. The actuators of the rear axle slip angle control (HSR) convert the calculated steering 
angle into an active steering angle at both rear wheels. The resultant stabilizing yaw moment allows 
the maximum brake forces to be applied in order to achieve the shortest possible stopping distance. 
The perfect interaction of steering and brake intervention therefore increases active safety and 
enhances the driving dynamics of the vehicle. 

6.2.5. Service information 

In the event of a repair, the steering gear can be fully lowered. This eliminates the need for complex 
axle disassembly and repair costs are reduced significantly. 

Steering angle 

The steering angle is calculated by the control unit of the electromechanical power steering using 
the rotor angle sensor. In the event of a loss of the voltage supply, this stored value is lost and must 
be taught again. This can be done statically by turning the wheels to the right and left with the engine 
running or dynamically when driving slowly.

In order to avoid damage to the wheel arches when driving with snow chains, the rear axle slip

the controller on the Central Information Display (CID). The maximum permitted speed is 50 km/h (31 
mph) his speed is exceeded, the rear axle slip angle control (HSR) switches on again automatically.

6.3. Electronic Damper Control (EDC) 

In order to meet the high customer demands with respect to comfort and driving dynamics, the G12 
is equipped as standard with Electronic Damper Control (EDC). The electronically controlled shock 
absorbers form a unit with the respective air suspension strut and cannot be replaced separately. 
There are 2 electric control valves on each shock absorber which allow the compression and rebound 
stages of the regulated shock absorbers to be adjusted separately from each other. This makes it 
possible to perfectly counteract the vibrations of the body and wheels. This increases safety, comfort 
and driving dynamics. 

6.3.1. Shock absorber design 

The shock absorbers are single-tube gas-filled shock absorbers. The gas cushion consists of nitrogen 
at a pressure of 16.5 bar. This is pressed together and thus compressed further by the oil displaced 
when the piston rod is retracted. The high gas pressure prevents foaming of the oil under all operating 
conditions and thus guarantees optimum shock absorber operation. In addition, the high gas pressure 
ensures that the piston rod is pressed out with a force of approximately 400 N (~ 40 kg). Compression 
of the shock absorber by hand is therefore hardly possible. 

The following graphic shows the internal design of an electrically regulated shock absorber.

In order to permit a sporty driving style on good roads while still absorbing bumps on rough road 
surfaces as comfortably as possible, the oil flow inside the shock absorber can be variably adjusted. 
The changes in the oil flow change the forces acting on the shock absorber. 

The shock absorber has 2 control valves, which allow separate adjustment of the damping force for 
rebound (rebound stage) and compression (compression stage). 

The control valves adjust the damping force by changing a restrictor cross-section through which an 
oil flow is pressed. The following relationship exists between the restrictor cross-section and damping 
force: 


• Large restrictor cross-section = low damping force. 

• Small restrictor cross-section = high damping force. 

The restrictor cross-section and thus the damping force can be adjusted seamless few milliseconds. 

Compression stage 

During compression, the shock absorber is pushed together telescopically and operated in the 
so-called compression stage. 

Rebound 

During rebound, the shock absorber is extended telescopically and operated in the so-called rebound 
stage. 


6.3.2. System overview 

The driving experience switch is used to configure the shock absorber adjustment setting. 

It is possible to choose between a sportily firm or comfortably soft chassis and suspension setup. 
The following table provides an overview of the setting options.

The Electronic Damper Control (EDC) comprises the following components: 


• 4 electrically controlled shock absorbers with 2 control valves each 

• Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) control unit 

• 4 ride height sensors for determination of wheel movement 

• Sensor cluster for determination of body movement (lift, pitch and roll) 


88 










































G12 Chassis and Suspension 

6. Driving Stability Control 

The Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) control unit uses various data such as body movement, 
transverse and longitudinal acceleration, steering angle and the road condition to calculate wheel- 
individual control commands for the electrical control valves in the shock absorbers. In this way, the 
damping force of the individual shock absorbers is continuously changed approximately 100 times 
per second. This means that demand-based adjustment of the damping force is always possible 
corresponding 
to the driving situation. 

Fewer vehicle body movements are permitted if a sportier driving mode is selected. The shock 
absorbers are adjusted to a hard setting more quickly and more often. This automatically results 
in a loss of comfort. 

In the standard equipment configuration, information about the vertical body movements (pitch, roll 
and lift) is made available by the Crash Safety Module ACSM-High. The retraction and extension 
speeds of the shock absorbers are determined by means of the ride height sensors. 

If the vehicle is equipped with the optional equipment “Active Comfort Drive” (SA 2VS), there are 
additional wheel acceleration sensors. These are used among other things for more precise regulation 
of the Electronic Damper Control (EDC). 

The following table shows the different components used depending on the chassis and suspension 
package.

6.3.3. Electrical shock absorber control 

The control valves of the rebound and compression stages are activated via pulse-width modulated

When the piston rod is retracted, the oil volume displaced by the retracting piston is pressed through 
the bottom valve into the compensating reservoir and generates a damping force at the bottom valve 
in the process. The oil volume displaced by the working piston is pressed through the comfort and 
control valve of the compression stage and thus passes from the working chamber below the working 
piston into the working chamber above the piston. The restrictor cross-section in the control valve 
adjusts the damping force. The oil flow is forced through the main valve when the control valve is 
closed. The maximum possible damping force is then set.

When the piston rod is extended, the gas pressure forces the necessary compensation volume out 
of the compensating chamber through the bottom valve into the working chamber below the working 
piston. The oil volume displaced by the working piston is pressed through the comfort and control 
valve of the rebound stage and thus passes from the working chamber above the working piston into 
the working chamber below the piston. The restrictor cross-section in the control valve adjusts the 
damping force. The oil is forced through the main valve of the rebound stage when the control valve 
is closed. The maximum possible damping force is then set.

• Optional equipment (“Active Comfort Drive” SA 2VS) 

Electric active roll stabilization on front and rear axle EARSW/EARSVH.

When cornering, the lateral acceleration (aq) acts at the vehicle center of gravity (SP). The body rolls 
about the roll axis (RA), which is defined by the kinematics of the front and rear axles. This results in 
the roll angle (cp). 


On vehicles with the optional equipment “Active Comfort Drive” (SA 2VS), the roll moment (Mw) can 
be compensated solely by the active stabilizers up to a certain lateral acceleration. A roll angle (cp) 
builds up only when the roll moment (Mw) exceeds the counter-torque (Ma) set by the active stabilizer.

Rear axle anti-roll bar

Front axle anti-roll bar 


As standard, conventional anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles reduce the roll tendency of the 
body during fast cornering or fast avoidance manoeuvres. However, there are also comfort losses in 
the case of one-sided road bumps due to the torsion spring characteristics of a conventional anti¬ 
roll bar. If a conventional anti-roll bar is excited by a pulse at a wheel on one side, this leads to spring 
oscillations of the anti-roll bar so that the wheel at the other end of the anti-roll bar also performs or 
"copies" these oscillations. Since the anti-roll bar is pivot-mounted on the body, the driver also feels 
the roll oscillations caused by this so-called "copying". 

6.5.1. Chassis and suspension setup 

Vehicle drivability when cornering can be greatly influenced by anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles. 
A decisive factor here is the roll moment ratio between the front and rear vehicle axles. 

This ratio depends on the respective anti-roll bar moments of the two axles. 

The following table provides an overview of the possible roll moment ratios and the resultant handling 
of the vehicle.

With a conventional anti-roll bar, the roll moment ratio is optimally adapted to the respective vehicle. 
It is aimed to achieve handling with slight understeer. For normal drivers, an oversteering vehicle is 
more difficult to control than an understeering vehicle. 


6.6. Active Comfort Drive 

The previously known optional equipment Adaptive Drive is replaced in the G12 by the enhanced 
suspension control system “Active Comfort Drive”. 

The various driving dynamics control systems are networked together in the optional chassis and 
suspension package “Active Comfort Drive” in order to achieve perfect driving dynamics combined 
with high ride comfort. Information is read in from a large number of sensors by the Vertical Dynamics 
Platform (VDP) control unit and the corresponding control commands are output to the different 
actuators. The aim is to above all detect road bumps and obstacles ahead as early as possible and 
to derive appropriate counter-measures.

The optional chassis and suspension package “Active Comfort Drive” has the following additional 
components: 

• Wheel acceleration sensors on all 4 wheel carriers 

• Electric active stabilizers on the front and rear axles 

• An additional 12V battery as well as a DC/DC converter 

• A stereo camera in the windscreen 

Wheel acceleration sensors are used in the optional chassis and suspension package “Active Comfort 
Drive” for the following reasons: 

• More precise disturbance variable control of the electric active stabilizers (EARSV) possible. 
Avoidance of so-called copying from one wheel to the other in the event of road bumps. 

• Precise regulation of the Electronic Damper Control (EDC) is possible through detection 
of the wheel movement via the wheel acceleration sensors and the body movement via the 
ride height sensors. 

Processing of the two information sources allows use of a simplified control unit version 
of the Crash Safety Module (ACSM-Low).

In order to prepare the chassis and suspension for the different road conditions as early as possible, 
the following data is read in from various control units and processed to allow predictive control: 

• If ADAPTIVE driving mode has been activated via the driving experience switch, the Dynamic 
Stability Control control unit processes the navigation data to analyses the route and 
influences the driving program to be activated if necessary. If the vehicle is approaching a 
sharp bend at high speed, for example, the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) activates Sport 
mode without any action on the part of the driver. The Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) reads 
in this information and activates the corresponding chassis components for Sport mode. 
Conversely, an automatic change in driving program from Sport to Comfort is also possible. 

If the vehicle exits a twisting section of road through which it has been driven at speed and 
then drives at constant speed on a straight section, this results in automatic changeover to the 
Comfort driving program. This means that the optimum driving mode with respect to comfort 
(Comfort) and driving dynamics (Sport) is automatically set without manual operation of the 
driving experience switch depending on the driving style and probable route. 

Route guidance need not be activated for this. 

• The Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) reads in the information of the stereo camera in the 
windscreen independently of the selected driving mode and processes this. 

In addition, a large quantity of additional information such as the driving style analysis is read in by the 
Vertical Dynamic Platform (VDP) control unit and used for predictive control of the standard Electronic 
Damper Control (EDC) as well as the electric active stabilizers (EARSV). 

Obstacles can therefore be overcome predictively and with even more comfort. The driver is even less 
aware of bumps. The body of the vehicle does not have to move vertically to the same extent since the 
chassis and suspension react intelligently and predictively to road bumps. 

The optional chassis and suspension package “Active Comfort Drive” therefore offers the following 
advantages: 

• Reduced compression and rebound (EDC). 

• Reduced pitch movement (EDC). 

• Faster decay of vehicle body reverberations (EDC). 

• High driving dynamics when cornering thanks to active roll stabilization (EARSV). 

• High comfort for straight-ahead driving due to decoupling of anti-roll bar halves 
and thus avoidance of road bump "copying" (EARSV). 

The functions of the chassis and suspension package "Active Comfort Drive” are available in different 
forms in the following positions of the driving experience switch.

The ride comfort and driving dynamics thus remain at a very high level under all conditions.

6.6.2. Electric active roll stabilization (EARSV) 

As the first vehicle manufacturer worldwide, BMW uses electric active stabilizers instead of the 
previously used hydraulic active stabilizers. The electric active stabilizers in the optional equipment 
“Active Comfort Drive” (SA 2VS) reduce the roll tendency of the body in bends by targeted application 
of mechanical moments on the stabilizer halves by means of an electric motor. 

The following graphic shows a schematic system comparison between the active hydraulic stabilizer 
and the active electric stabilizer.

Electrification of the active stabilizer offers the following advantages: 

• Simple integration in “full hybrid” drive systems 

Active roll stabilization is possible during purely electric driving. 

• Simple decoupling of the stabilizer halves during straight-ahead driving 
Improved ride comfort due to prevention of road bump "copying" 

• Increased efficiency 

Energy is required exclusively during the control actions and does not need to be 
kept permanently available like in a hydraulic system. 

Self-aligning forces which act on the electric motor in the stabilizer can be partially 
converted into electric current and fed back into the vehicle electrical system.

A particular advantage which contributes above all to increasing ride comfort is the prevention of 
so-called "copying". When the vehicle is driving straight-ahead and drives over road bumps, electric 
active roll stabilization EARSV permits practically full decoupling of the left and right sides to that 
copy vibrations are almost excluded. The electric active stabilizers therefore compensate for the 
disadvantages of conventional anti-roll bars. 

The following variables are mainly used for calculation of the required activation of the electric active 
stabilizers. 

• Current lateral and longitudinal acceleration 

• Vehicle speed 

• Steering angle 

• Wheel acceleration 

• Ride heights 

The incipient roll moment (Mw) is rapidly counteracted by fast processing of the data and activation 
of electric active roll stabilization (EARSV).

The active stabilizers receive the control request from the Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) control 
unit. The bus telegrams are read in and processed by the control units of the two active stabilizers 
(EARSW/EARSVH). The two stabilizer halves are twisted with respect to each other by activation of 
the electric motor. Central energy conversion takes place in the permanently excited synchronous 
motor, whose direction of rotation, torque and speed are controlled via the set rotating field. 

Power transmission takes place via the three-stage planetary gear, which converts the torque of 
the electric motor to the required stabilizer output torsion torque with a ratio of 1:158. A maximum 
stabilizer torsion torque of 750 Nm is currently implemented in the G12. The system is designed for 
significantly higher torsion torques in order to also permit compensation of superposition effects 
due to road bumps. 

The elastomer decoupling element between the planetary gear and stabilizer torsion spring has the 
task of decoupling highly dynamic, low-amplitude excitations from the road. This thus makes a further 
contribution to meeting the high comfort goals.

A torque sensor inside the component provides feedback on the current control torques to the control 
unit. A plausibility check of the data allows various faults to be detected and then stored in the form of 
a fault code entry. However, repair of the component is not possible. The active electric stabilizer must 
be replaced as a complete unit in the event of a mechanical component defect. 

Since the electric active stabilizer will be available in other vehicle models in future, the control unit 
must be taught for the respective vehicle by means of version encoding after installation. This ensures 
that the electric active stabilizer provides the correct control torques for the vehicle in question.

The above graphic shows the current consumption and output of the electric active stabilizer for a 
driving manoeuvre with approximately 30 % energy recovery. It must be noted that this diagram is just 
a snapshot representation. Depending on the driving manoeuvre, the activation power and energy 
recovery of the electric active stabilizer may differ considerably.

In order to ensure that the consumers of the 12 V vehicle electrical system in the G12 are not 
influenced by the high load currents of the two electric active stabilizers, the stabilizers have been 
isolated from the basis vehicle electrical system by means of a DC/DC converter (500 W). 

The require energy for activation is provided by an additional 12 V battery located in the engine 
compartment. This means that other consumers are not affected by the high energy consumption. 

The battery is an auxiliary batter which supplies the vehicle electrical system with power depending 
on the vehicle equipment. For this reason, the battery may also be present even if the vehicle is not 
equipped with electric active stabilizers.

6.6.3. Control strategy 

Vehicle drivability when cornering can be greatly influenced by anti-roll bars on the front and rear 
axles. A decisive factor here is the roll moment ratio between the front and rear vehicle axles. This ratio 
depends on the respective anti-roll bar moments of the two axles. 

The following table provides an overview of the possible roll moment ratios and the resultant handling 
of the vehicle.

The active stabilizer allows the roll moment ratio to be adapted to the respective driving situation in 
order to increase the driving dynamics. The roll moment ratio is 50 : 50 (neutral) in the lower speed 
range (0 ~ 50 km/h). The roll moment ratio is adjusted towards understeer with increasing speed. 

Application of roll moments via the active stabilizer influences the cornering forces that can be 
transferred by the tires. 

The following graphic shows the maximum cornering forces that can be transferred when cornering 
as a function of the applied stabilizer moments.

When cornering, a counter-torque (Ma) is applied by the active stabilizers to counteract the acting 
roll moment (Mw). The moments (Ma) applied depending on the action of the active stabilizers either 
increase or reduce the tire contact forces of the different wheels. 

If a wheel is loaded with a particularly high force by the active stabilizer, its transferable cornering force 
increases due to the higher tire contact force. In contrast, the load on the opposite wheel is relieved, 
and its cornering force is thus reduced due to the lower tire contact force. The resultant tire contact 
forces characterise the transferable cornering forces of the wheels on an axle. 

Since the reduction in the transferable cornering forces of the relieved wheel is proportionately higher 
than the increase in the transferable cornering forces of the loaded wheel as a result of increasing 
active stabilizer force, this means that there is a reduction in the resultant cornering force of the wheels 
on this axle. 

In the direct comparison of the two axles in the above diagram, it can be seen that the rear axle can 
transfer a higher resultant transferable cornering force than the front axle. In the limit range, the vehicle 
would therefore push over the front wheels, i.e. understeer. 

It is easier for an inexperienced driver to regain control over the vehicle again in this situation than if 
the vehicle were to oversteer (vehicle skids at the rear axle).
