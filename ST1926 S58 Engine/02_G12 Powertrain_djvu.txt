2. Drive Variants 


Like the predecessor, the G12 is also optionally available with all-wheel drive. For the market 
introduction, it is possible to choose between 6 and 8-cylinder engines. Further engines will follow 
at a later date. 

The 6-cylinder engine is a newly developed gasoline engine of the modular family (B-engines) which 
have their series introduction in the F30 LCI and G12. 

The 8-cylinder gasoline engine N63TU2 has also been revamped for the second time and also has 
its series introduction in the G12. 

All engines comply with the exhaust emission standard ULEVII. Lower exhaust emission standards.

Resonator 

The pulsating air flow of the rotating engine is damped in the air intake duct by using resonators. 
The B58 engine of the G12 has a total of 2 resonators. 

Broadband silencer 

If a blow-off valve is no longer used on turbo engines, a transient high-frequency noise occurs 
when the engine load is reduced. This is caused by the turbocharger pressure on the intake side. 
Broadband silencers are matched to this to a frequency of approximately 3 kHz to eliminate it.

Digital Motor Electronics (DME) 


The exhaust flap is integrated in the rear silencer. The exhaust flap is driven via an electric motor with 
integrated transmission and electronics. The actuator of the electrically adjustable exhaust flap has 
the following electrical connections: 


• Voltage supply (+) 

• Ground (-) 

• Actuating wire (PWM signal line) 


At low engine speed and low load, the exhaust flap allows the noise level to be significantly reduced by 
closing the exhaust flap. At high engine speed and high load, the exhaust gas counterpressure can be 
reduced by opening the exhaust flap. 


27 



















G12 Powertrain 

3. Gasoline Engines 

The exhaust flap is activated by the Digital Motor Electronics (DME) by means of a pulse-width- 
modulated signal. The input variables are: 

• Engine speed 

• Load 

• Driving speed 

The exhaust flap cannot travel to an intermediate position and is either completely open or closed. 
The flap is moved to the respective mechanical end stops by means of pulse-width modulated signals 
(PWM signals). The preferred position is the open position in the event of detected faults or loss of 
activation or after the engine is switched off.

4.1. Active air-flap control 

The cooling surfaces at the front of the vehicle can be closed by means of two separate air flaps. 
This reduces the drag coefficient and thus saves fuel. A further advantage is faster heating up of 
the engine after a cold start. It is possible to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions by a maximum of 
0.8 g/km. 



Ambient air flow with closed air flaps on G12 


The current cooling air requirement for engine cooling, brake cooling and air conditioning is 
determined by the Digital Motor Electronics (DME). The adjustable flaps are then moved to the 
proper position. The air flaps are opened as required. The flaps can be adjusted to different positions. 
The flaps of the BMW radiator grill are opened only when there is a high cooling requirement. The flaps 
can also be closed at high driving speeds.

5 of the 6 connector module of the engine control unit are equipped with a nano MQS plug connection 
(Micro Quadlok system) (see 3). 

The nano MQS plug connection offers the following advantages: 

• Low space requirement 

• Minimum mass 

• High vibration resistance 

With a minimum wire cross-section of 0.13 mm 2 - 0.35 mm 2 , the compact nano MQS plug connection 
offers a significant weight advantage combined with exceptionally good vibration resistance. As a 
result of the reduced installation dimensions, it was possible to reduce the space requirement on the 
PC board. The nano MQS plug connection can be operated with currents of up to a max. 3 A.

Measurements on the wiring harness must be performed exclusively using the measuring procedures 
approved by BMW. Use of the incorrect tools, such as measuring probes, can damage the plug-in 
contacts.

G12 Powertrain 

6. Engine Electrical System 

The comfort and availability of MSA 2.3 have been further increased compared with MSA 2.2. 

The following measures help enhance the comfort: 

• The automatic engine start-stop function is initiated at < 3 km/h / < 1.8 mph. 

This increases the availability of the automatic engine start-stop function and 
makes it easier for customers to understand its operation. 

• The automatic engine start-stop function stop is also initiated when the vehicle 
is at a standstill on uphill and downhill gradients. 

• Starting times and starter turning over are reduced. 

• Initiation of automatic engine start-stop function stop at driver request. 

• Prevention of automatic engine start-stop function stop by targeted "underbraking". 

• Reflex start up to higher engine speed is possible in the event of a sudden change in mind. 

• Improved stopping and starting comfort. 

• Manoeuvrability during automatic engine start-stop function coasting. 

• Manoeuvrability during reflex start. 

• Steering when at standstill during engine shutdown (straighten steering wheel). 

6.2.1. Automatic mode 

The automatic engine start-stop function is ready for operation following every engine start. 

The automatic engine start-stop function is activated as from a certain driving speed: 

• >5 km/h/> 3 mph 


6.2.2. Driving 

As long as the vehicle is in motion the driver will not be aware of the automatic engine start-stop 
function.

Explanation 

1 

Vehicle moving. 

2 

Selector lever in drive position "D", driver operates accelerator pedal. 

3 

Engine running, the engine speed display and fuel consumption display 
correspond to the driving situation. 


The goal of the automatic engine start-stop function is to switch off the engine when the vehicle speed 
falls below 3 km/h /1.8 mph on the flat or when the vehicle is at a standstill on uphill and downhill 
gradients. 


6.2.3. Stopping 

The stopping process with subsequent engine stop from the driver's point of view is as follows: 



Index 

Explanation 

1 

Vehicle is decelerated at a red traffic light, for example. 

2 

Selector lever remains in the "D" drive position, driver presses the brake pedal 
to decelerate the vehicle and the vehicle speed drops to < 3 km/h /1.8 mph or 
= 0 km/h / 0 mph on uphill or downhill gradients. 

3 

Engine is switched off, engine speed display shows “Ready”. The vehicle is 
held by the DSC hydraulics on uphill or downhill gradients. 


In the situation depicted above the driver holds the vehicle at a standstill by operating the brake pedal. 

Alternatively, the driver can move the selector lever from the "D" to the "P" position and release the 
brake pedal. The engine remains switched off. 


45 


















G12 Powertrain 

6. Engine Electrical System 

6.2.4. Pullaway 

The driver indicates his intention to drive off by releasing the brake pedal then operating the 
accelerator pedal. 



Index 

Explanation 

1 

Driver wishes to continue the journey (green light). 

2 

The selector lever remains in the "D" drive position, driver releases the brake 
pedal and then operates the accelerator pedal. 

3 

The engine is started, the engine speed display changes from “Ready” to idle 
speed. The vehicle drives off upon subsequent operation of the accelerator 
pedal. The DSC hydraulics is additionally released on uphill and downhill 
gradients. 


If the driver held the car at a standstill up to this point by operating the brake pedal, the engine starts 
as soon as the driver releases the brake pedal. 

If the driver put the selector lever into position "P" after the engine was switched off automatically, 
the engine starts automatically if the selector lever is now moved to position "D". 

In this case, the automatic engine start is activated by the DSC control unit that monitors the brake 
pressure, and not automatically via a signal from the brake light switch. 

Automatic Hold 

If the driver has activated the "Automatic Hold" function, he can also release the brake pedal once the 
vehicle has come to a standstill. The automatic engine start-stop function also switches the engine off 
in this case. The vehicle is held at a standstill by the DSC hydraulics. The engine only starts when the 
driver operates the accelerator pedal.

6.2.5. Automatic engine start-stop function stop on uphill gradients 

In contrast to the MSA 2.2, which immediately stopped the engine only up to an uphill or downhill 
gradient (up to approx. 3.5 %), with the MSA 2.3 the engine is also stopped on uphill or downhill 
gradients at vehicle standstill..

Explanation

This is made possible by communication of the MSA via the engine control DME, electronic 
transmission control (EGS) and Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). If an engine stop is initiated via 
MSA 2.3, the vehicle is simultaneously also held on uphill gradients via the DSC hydraulics (drive-off 
assistant). The vehicle does not roll back on uphill gradients even if the driver changes his mind with 
a so-called reflex start. 


47 












G12 Powertrain 

6. Engine Electrical System 

6.2.6. Comfort concept 

It was possible to further improve the stopping and starting comfort by intelligent interaction of the 
engine control DME, electronic transmission control (EGS) and the brake DSC. 

• By inclusion of the Valvetronic for the gasoline engine, the Valvetronic is adjusted almost 
completely to zero lift while the engine is being switched off. After the engine has stopped, the 
Valvetronic is adjusted to idle position again in order to be prepared for a possible engine start. 

• The vehicle can also be held securely on uphill and downhill gradients for an automatic engine 
stop and start by targeted use of the DSC hydraulics (drive-off assistant) in combination with 
the MSA 2.3. 

• The MSA 2.3 permits comfortable engine stopping and starting due to the fact that the 
transmission in the G12 can now be disconnected via the release at standstill function for the 
torque converter and thus for the automatic transmission. Without this release at standstill, 
any disturbing torque fluctuations that occur as a result of the automatic engine stop or start 
will be felt in the drive train.

With the MSA 2.3, the automatic engine start of the G12 with automatic transmission was further 
optimized by use of the release at standstill function. 

It is now possible to start the engine with even more comfort and without any influence on the drive 
train at the system start by using the release at standstill function. 


System start via release 
at standstill 

Convenient start 

Dynamic start 

The automatic engine start is 
effected by a system switch- 
on request (e.g. by the heating 
and air conditioning system), 
the brake pedal remains 
pressed. 

The automatic engine start 
is effected by releasing the 
brake, the accelerator pedal 
is not pressed. 

The automatic engine start 
is effected by releasing the 
brake, the accelerator pedal 
is pressed for drive off. 

The engine speed is slowly 
increased until it reaches the 
idle speed. 

The engine speed is slowly 
increased until it reaches 
the idle speed. 

The engine speed is increased 
quickly. 

The engine remains 
disconnected from the 
automatic transmission and 
thus from the drive train via the 
release at standstill function. 

The multidisc clutch in the 
automatic transmission 
closes slowly. 

The multidisc clutch in the 
automatic transmission 
closes quickly. 

This means that there is 
no influence on the drive 
train, thereby preventing a 
longitudinal jerk by the drive 
train which can be felt by the 
driver. 

Smooth and comfortable 
drive-off is made possible. 

Quick drive off is therefore 
made possible. 


For an engine start with fewer vibrations, with the system start and convenient starting the engine 
speed is initially increased quickly and then slower until it reaches the idle speed. The ignition timing 
is adjusted to the "late" direction for this.

6. Engine Electrical System 


6.2.8. Reflex start in the event of a change in mind 

The so-called reflex start is a significant challenge for the automatic engine start-stop function. This 
is the situation where the engine has not yet completely stopped after an automatic engine start-stop 
function stop, but an automatic start is already requested again. It was not possible with conventional 
starter motors to engage in a rotating ring gear during this reflex start. With the MSA 2.2, a new starter 
motor technology was used for the first time which enabled comfortable engagement up to an engine 
speed of 150 rpm. 

With the introduction of the MSA 2.3, it has now been possible to increase this to > 500 rpm. Since 
the possibilities with a conventional starter motor are exhausted here, this reflex start is done by the 
engine control DME. This function is referred to as a “flying start”: 

• Engine speed > 500 rpm 

The "flying start" function can be applied up to an engine speed of > 500 rpm. For this 
purpose, combustion is resumed again during the engine stopping process in the event of an 
automatic engine start-stop function stop and an initiated reflex start. This is achieved on the 
gasoline engine by targeted ignition in the relevant cylinders. 

• Engine speed < 500 rpm 

If the speed drops to below 500 rpm, the "flying start" function for a reflex start is no longer 
possible. In this case, it is necessary to wait until the engine speed has fallen below 150 rpm. 
The engine can be started again by means of the starter motor when the engine speed has 
dropped below 150 rpm.

6.2.9. Automatic engine stop at driver request 

Under certain conditions, it is possible that the driver would like to initiate an automatic engine start- 
stop function stop, e.g. with active switch-off inhibitor. 



Index 

Explanation 

1 

Vehicle is decelerated to a standstill at a red traffic light, for example. 

The engine continues running. 

2 

After the vehicle has come to a standstill, the brake pedal is briefly pressed 
forcefully and then is immediately held with the usual pedal force or "P" is 
selected briefly. 

3 

Engine is switched off, engine speed display shows “Ready”. 


6.2.10. Manoeuvrability for automatic engine start-stop function 
coasting or stop 

With MSA 2.3, steering is possible during automatic engine start-stop function coasting below V < 3 
km/h /1.8 mph or when the vehicle is stopped V = 0 km/h. In addition, a second 60 Ah AGM auxiliary 
battery may be used, depending on the optional equipment (SA), which supports the vehicle electrical 
system at engine standstill, e.g. in the automatic engine start-stop function stop phases, and thus also 
supports steering via the EPS when coasting below V > 3 km/h /1.8 mph or in the event of an engine 
standstill V = 0 km/h. 

Further information on the voltage supply for the 12 volt systems is provided in the Technical Training 
Manual “G12 General Vehicle Electronics”. 


6.2.11. Switch-off inhibitors 

Under certain conditions it is necessary to suppress the automatic engine start-stop function. 
The following parameters change with the MSA 2.3 compared with the MSA 2.2: 

• The vehicle is rolling on uphill or downhill gradients (driving speed > 1 km/h / .6 mph). 

• The ambient temperature is above 35 °C / 95°F with the air conditioning switched 
on (30 °C / 86°F for MSA 2.2).

The engine control unit controls the Active Sound Design (ASD) of the vehicle using characteristic 
data such as engine speed, load and driving speed. The ASD transports the optimum sound into the 
vehicle interior. 

The Active Sound Design (ASD) can be temporarily deactivated during a test drive (noise analysis 
drive) by means of the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. However, permanent deactivation of the ASD is 
not possible. If the ASD is deactivated via the ISTA function "ASD muting ON", the ASD will remain 
switched off only until the next terminal change.

7.2. Highlights 

The following further developments made it possible to increase the comfort, dynamics and efficiency 
of the revamped 8-speed automatic gearbox: 

• Improved driving comfort through hot-end decoupling of the rotational 
imbalance of the engine by means of a centrifugal pendulum. 

• Improved shifting comfort through slightly increased gear steps 
(2 modified planetary gear sets). 

• Increased efficiency through optimum gear spread and gear stepping. 

• Reduction of vehicle-specific insulation measures due to acoustic 
encapsulation on the transmission. 

• Functional enhancements in the area of ConnectedShift. 

• Enhanced customer experience due to new operating possibilities 
with the driving experience switch or shift paddles.

7.6. Torque converter with centrifugal pendulum 

In order to reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, high-charged engines are used, 
the number of cylinders is reduced and the drivable speeds are lowered. 

However, with these measures the rotational imbalance at the crankshaft is increased which 
is caused by the acceleration during the power cycle and deceleration during the compression 
cycle. This irregular rotation is the reason for torsional vibrations in the drive train. 

The occurring torsional vibrations near the source, i.e. in the torque converter, are therefore minimized. 


58 
















G12 Powertrain 
7. Automatic Transmission 


When the converter lockup clutch is open there is a difference in speed or a slip in the torque converter 
between pump and turbine wheel. The torsional vibrations of the engine can be compensated by 
this slip and the hydrodynamic power transmission. However, the slip has a negative effect on the 
efficiency. 

When the converter lockup clutch is closed there is a positive connection between the impeller and 
the turbine wheel. A slip is avoided, however there is no longer any vibration-reducing effect. This is 
why a spring/damper system is installed which reduces the torsional vibrations of the engine.

Torsional vibrations of the engine 


The centrifugal pendulum consists of 2 guide plates which are attached to each other and which 
allow damping masses to move between them on defined paths. Arch-shaped curved tracks are 
integrated in the sheet metal and in the masses, which serve as running tracks. The damping masses 
are connected with the guide plates by two rollers in each case and can move along the curved paths. 

The centrifugal pendulum consists of several oscillating masses (dynamic vibration absorbers). 

They vibrate contrary to the torsional vibrations and compensate for these. At low engine speeds, 
i.e. precisely when the annoying vibrations occur most, the deflection of the dynamic vibration 
absorbers is particularly big. 


61 







G12 Powertrain 
7. Automatic Transmission 


The following advantages result from deleting the torsional vibrations: 

• The converter lockup clutch can remain closed over a larger engine speed range. 

• The slip in the converter lockup clutch can be reduced and thus also the slip percentage 
in the torque converter. The efficiency is therefore improved. 

• Lower engine speeds can be driven. 

These measures lead to a reduction of the fuel consumption and improved acoustics in the passenger 
compartment. 


7.7. Sport automatic transmission 

In the standard equipment Steptronic Sport transmission (2TB), the customer additionally receives 2 
shift paddles on the steering wheel and additional functions such as the Launch Control. 

7.7.1. Launch Control 

As an additional customer function, vehicles with the optional equipment Steptronic Sport 
transmission (2TB) are equipped with a Launch Control. This function allows customers to reproduce 
the manufacturer's specifications for 0-100 km/h / 0 - 62 mph acceleration (racing start) in good 
ambient conditions when the transmission is at operating temperature. 

The following illustration shows the 5 steps for activation of Launch Control.

Downshift 


The driver can change to manual shift mode by means of the shift paddles. The driver can manually 
shift to the next higher or lower gears by actuating the +/- shift paddles. 

Activation of manual shift mode in "D" position (Drive) 

If one of the two shift paddles (+ or -) is pressed in "D" position, the electronic transmission control 
(EGS) switches to a time-limited manual shift mode. Depending on the route profile, this mode is 
cancelled automatically either earlier or later (normal value approximately 20 s) if one of the two shift 
paddles is not actuated in this time. The driving profile is detected by means of the steering wheel 
movements as well as the dynamic acceleration forces acting on the vehicle. 

It is possible to cancel manual mode prematurely by a long pull on the + shift paddle. 


63 









G12 Powertrain 
7. Automatic Transmission 


Activation of manual shift mode in "S" position (Sport) 

If one of the two shift paddles (+/-) is actuated, the electronic transmission control (EGS) permanently 
switches to manual shift mode. 

It is possible to cancel manual mode again by a long pull on the + shift paddle. 


Activation of coasting 

The driver can manually activate coasting mode by means of the following configuration: 

• Gear selector switch in D position (Drive) 

• Driving experience switch in ECO PRO mode 

• Accelerator pedal not actuated 

• Coasting mode activated in ECO PRO configuration menu (CID) 

• Multiple operation of + shift paddle until no logical higher gear selection is possible 

The vehicle now switches to coasting mode. The engine is disengaged from the transmission in 
coasting mode. The engine continues running at idle speed. 

Coasting mode is cancelled again by actuating the - shift paddle or the accelerator pedal. 

The respective mode is displayed to the driver by means of the BMW EfficientDynamics display in the 
instrument cluster.

7.8. ConnectedShift 

ConnectedShift uses the following systems for a predictive shift strategy: 

• Use of the navigation data 

• Use of the radar sensors 

Use of the navigation data is already known from the 5 Series LCI. Use of the navigation data is 
mentioned in this document to better understand the system. 

7.8.1. Use of the navigation data 

ConnectedShift uses navigation data for a forward-thinking shift strategy of the automatic 
transmission. If, for example, a sharp bend is detected, the automatic transmission shifts down 
early and the gear is retained in the bend. 

The route guidance of the navigation system does not need to be activated for the function. However, 
the identification of a turn-off request, for example by the active route guidance or operating the turn 
indicator, helps to control the system more accurately. Up-to-date navigation map data also influences 
the control accuracy. 

Advantages 

ConnectedShift offers various advantages depending on the route: 


Traffic guidance 

Advantages 

Bend/Subsequent bend 

• Higher engine braking effect before the bend 

• Tensile force reserve for accelerating from the bend 

• Optimized shift characteristics in the bend 

Intersections 

Upon recognized turn-off request by active route guidance 
or operation of the turn indicator: 


• Higher engine braking effect before intersections 

• Optimized shift characteristics in the intersections 

Traffic circle 

• Higher engine braking effect before the traffic circle 

• Tensile force reserve before entry 


• Optimized shift characteristics in the traffic circle 
and in the exit

ConnectedShift can select downshifts before curves and avoid up and down shifts between 
consecutive curves. A higher engine braking effect before a curve is achieved, as well as a reduction 
of the shift frequency in curves and optimal exiting from the curves. 


7.8.2. Use of radar 

The radar-based ConnectedShift is new and available for the first time in a BMW vehicle. 

A prerequisite for use of this function is equipment with front and rear radar systems. The following 
table provides information on the vehicle equipment in which a radar system is used.

If a vehicle detects rapid approach to an obstacle via the front radar, the electronic transmission control 
(EGS) automatically shifts down to a lower gear. 

The lower gear offers the driver the following advantages: 

• The higher engine braking torque reduces the driving speed if the driver 
is not trying to overtake. 

• If an overtaking manoeuvre is about to take place, the driver has a higher 
tractive power reserve of the engine available. 

In addition to the front radar, the system also uses the side radar, e.g. in order to make it easier to feed 
into flowing traffic thanks to an optimum gear selection.

G12 Powertrain 
7. Automatic Transmission 

7.8.3. Characteristics and availability 

In SPORT and COMFORT modes the characteristics of ConnectedShift are adapted to the respective 
driving program, in ECO PRO mode ConnectedShift is not available. ConnectedShift is also not 
available during control operation of cruise control. 

A prerequisite is that the navigation map data and the required additional information for the country 
are available. This is dependent on the navigation map provider and is not available worldwide for all 
countries. 

A prerequisite for radar-based ConnectedShift is the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Plus 
(5AT). 


7.9. New functions 


7.9.1. Transmission behavior when driving off 

When the vehicle is at standstill with the brake pedal pressed and the selected drive position, a defined 
converter slip of the automatic transmission is not set as previously. Instead, the clutch remains 
completely open for selection of a gear (release at standstill). When the brake is released after vehicle 
standstill, the vehicle does not crawl (roiling away possible). Crawling can be activated on request by 
pressing the accelerator pedal. The crawl function is cancelled again only when the vehicle is once 
more at standstill. 


7.9.2. Stepped Sport shift mode 

A new feature in the G12 is an additional sport shift map which offers the driver a further configuration 
option between "D" (Drive) and "S" (Sport) drive positions.

With previous automatic transmissions, it was possible to change to Sport mode for a sporty driving 
style only by means of the gear selector switch. 


In the G12, there is an additional stepped Sport shift mode, which can be activated as follows: 

• Gear selector switch in D position (Drive) 

• Driving experience switch in Sport 

In stepped Sport shift mode, upshifts take place later and downshifts earlier than in D (Drive) mode. 
However, the shift points are not at the same level as for pure Sport mode (gear selector switch in S). 

The stepped Sport shift mode can be activated or deactivated by means of the personalization menu 
on the Central Information Display (CID). 

This additional configuration option allows the driver to adapt the vehicle to his gearshift wishes 
more exactly.

7.10.2. Electronic transmission emergency release 

Operation of the electronic transmission emergency release was simplified in the G12. The required 
conditions and procedure are explained in more detail below. 

Electronic transmission emergency release is possible only when the engine does not start but the 
starter motor turns. 

The electronic transmission emergency release is active for 30 minutes. Wheel speed signals due 
to movement of the vehicle do not have any influence on the predefined period, but they prevent the 
parking lock from being engaged as long as they are transmitted. If a vehicle is moved shortly before 
expiry of the 30 minutes, for example, the parking lock will be engaged only when the vehicle comes 
to a standstill again. The time specified is also dependent on the battery capacity. Time-independent 
activation of the parking lock takes place if the battery voltage falls below defined voltage thresholds.

Towing of the automatic transmission on the driven vehicle axle is not permitted. Limited time and 
speed-dependent towing would not technically damage the automatic transmission, but permanent 
release of the parking lock cannot be guaranteed due to the changed mechanical and electronic 
transmission emergency release. Sudden engagement of the parking lock during a towing operation 
on the driven vehicle axle can lead to damage to the vehicle and to serious accidents.

8.1. Overview of all-wheel drive systems 

The all-wheel drive variants used at BMW differ with respect to the different drive platforms. Although 
the all-wheel drive system of the front-wheel drive-based vehicles such as the XI F48 differs from that 
of the rear-wheel drive-based vehicles, both all-wheel drive systems are referred to as xDrive at BMW.

8.2. New features in xDrive 

The optional all-wheel drive of the G12 does not differ visually from the rear-wheel drive-based xDrive 
systems currently used. 

However, the xDrive of the G12 offers the following new features: 

• The maximum transferable torque to 1300 Nm. 

• Reduction in the thermal load by over-opening of the all-wheel drive multidisc clutches. 

• Reduced fuel consumption by intelligent all-wheel drive control and demand-based 
oil level control in the transfer box (Efficiency Mode).

The torque generated by the engine is stepped up in the automatic transmission and is supplied 
via the transmission output shaft to the transfer box. The downstream transfer box in the drive train 
has the task of variably distributing the torque to the front and rear axles depending on the driving 
situation. Since a rigid connection of the rear axle with the front axle is not possible due to possible 
differences in the wheel speeds, there is a multidisc clutch inside the transfer case. The multidisc 
clutch performs the task of variable torque distribution between the two drive axles.

8. Four-Wheel Drive 


The multidisc clutch in the all-wheel drive transfer box allows the torque to be distributed to both axles 
within certain limits. Seen statistically, the torque distribution between the front and rear axles on the 
current BMW all-wheel drive vehicles is 40:60. In the G12, the torque distribution to the two drive axles 
was split equally in the direction of 50:50. In terms of dynamics, however, other important parameters 
such as different wheel slip values play a part. It is no longer possible to speak of a 50:50 torque 
distribution with different wheel slip values at the two drive axles. In this case, the drive torques are 
distributed variably in the range between theoretically 0:100 and 100:0 corresponding to the driving 
situation. 

The entire torque is transmitted to the rear axle when the multidisc clutch is open. The multidisc clutch 
must be closed in order to transfer torque to the front axle. 

The clutch torque to be transmitted is calculated in the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and is 
forwarded to the transfer box control unit via a FlexRay bus. The transfer box control unit calculates the 
angle to be set at the toothed adjusting ring from the requested clutch torque. The adjusting torque 
required for control is generated by an electric motor. 

The contact pressure of the multidisc clutch is increased depending on the requested torque 
distributions. As a result, the stepped-up engine torque is seamlessly distributed between the two 
drive axles corresponding to the driving situation.

“Efficiency Mode” is a new development in the area of drag torque reduction and is designed to 
increase efficiency. The multidisc clutches of the transfer box are opened depending on the driving 
situation by intelligent control of the all-wheel drive system. This permits reduction of the lubrication 
in the transfer box. A distinction is made between the following functions: 

• Oil stop 

• Oil reservoir 

Both of these functions are described in more detail below. Both functions have the task of minimizing 
losses in the transfer box. They are always activated in parallel, but act in different areas of the unit. 

Efficiency Mode is always used when there is no all-wheel drive request from the DSC control unit and 
the multidisc clutch is therefore open.

The oil stop function of the xDrive transfer box offers the following advantages: 

• Reduction in the engine drag torques when the multidisc clutch is open. 

• Fast availability of lubrication oil for the multidisc clutch thanks to small oil 
reservoir directly in front of the disc set. 

The oil supply to the clutch pack is blocked when the multidisc clutch is open. The oil is stored in the 
line and in the oil reservoir. The toothed adjusting ring is rotated by means of the worm shaft in order to 
activate and deactivate the oil stop. The oil flow to the multidisc clutch is interrupted by rotation of the 
adjusting ring. In the event of a torque request to the transfer box (multidisc clutch is closed), the oil 
supply is opened again due to rotation of the adjusting ring and the multidisc clutch is lubricated and 
cooled. 

The lower oil fill level means that churning losses, which are caused by immersion of the rotated 
multidisc clutch, are eliminated. This reduces fuel consumption as well as wear on the multidisc clutch.

The oil reservoir is closed when no torque request is made to the transfer box (multidisc clutch is 
open). The oil reservoir has the task of storing the oil in a defined space (oil chamber 2). The oil 
reservoir function is done by a lever system which is supported in the housing and which closes 
a defined opening by means of an elastomer seal. 

A switching shaft, which is moved by the toothed adjusting ring, actuates the oil reservoir and keeps 
it in the designated position. The oil chambers are closed off with respect to each other, reducing 
churning losses to a minimum. A defined quantity of oil always remains in circulation in order to 
guarantee lubrication of bearings and sealing rings. This is ensured by an overflow between the 
1st and 2nd oil chambers.

8.5. Operating strategy 

The all-wheel drive (xDrive) was designed as an intelligent system in the G12. Intelligent control of 
the xDrive supports efficient and thus fuel-saving operation of the vehicle. However, the all-wheel 
drive is not switched off or deactivated, for example, but is adapted corresponding to the current 
driving situation. A large number of different sensors supply information about the current traction 
requirement. The drive torque is distributed to the different drive wheels as required corresponding 
to the traction and driving dynamics.

xDrive 


In many driving situations the all-wheel drive multidisc clutch is open and only the rear wheels are 
driven. Only in certain driving situations is some of the drive torque also transmitted to the front 
wheels. The distribution of the drive torque takes place proactively. Calculation of the required 
distribution takes place in the control unit for Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). 

The DSC takes into account the following criteria for calculation of the torque distribution: 

• Vehicle speed 

• Lateral and longitudinal acceleration 

• Yaw rate 

• Brake control (ABS) 

• Steering angle 

• Wheel speeds 

• Vehicle longitudinal inclination 

• Pedal sensor position 

• Driving program (SPORT, COMFORT, ECO PRO) 

• DSC status (DSC activated/deactivated, DTC activated/deactivated) 

Depending on the driving situation, some of the drive torque is transmitted to the front wheels. 

The exact ratio of the torque distribution is dependent on the activation of the multidisc clutch, 
as well as the slip of the wheels. Some of the influencing factors are listed below. 

The all-wheel drive clutch torque is increased in the following driving situations if there are no other 
criteria present that prevent this: 

• Road speed < 20 kph / <12 mph 

• Driving program SPORT activated 

• Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) deactivated 

• Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) activated 

• Oversteering vehicle 

• Increased difference in speed between front and rear wheels 

• Large vehicle longitudinal inclination (e.g. on inclines) 

• High accelerator pedal input, e.g. kick-down position 

• Load reversal conditions such as transition to coasting overrun 
(driver takes his foot off the accelerator pedal) 


89 








G12 Powertrain 

8. Four-Wheel Drive 

The all-wheel drive clutch torque is reduced in the following driving situations if there are no other 
criteria present that prevent this: 

• Driving speeds >180 km/h / >111 mph 

• Understeering vehicle 

• With increasing steering angle (to avoid distortions in the drive train) 

• Strong braking (ABS braking) 

To assess the road condition and to ensure effective, proactive longitudinal torque distribution, 
the coefficients of friction between the tires and roadway are determined by the DSC control unit. 

The wheel slip as well as the longitudinal and lateral acceleration are evaluated for this purpose, 
for example. 

If wheel speed information received by the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) suggests different tire 
rolling circumferences of the wheels (e.g. in the case of tires with significant differences in the amount 
of wear), the all-wheel drive multidisc clutch is closed to a lesser extent than in the normal case. This 
prevents excessive distortion in the drive train, which would lead to high power losses of the xDrive. 

8.5.1. Determination of the wheel slip 

Wheel slip occurs on the wheels of the different axles both as a result of acceleration and deceleration. 
The wheel slip is determined using the sensor signals from all wheel speed sensors as well as an 
arithmetic model in the DSC control unit. 

The wheel slip can be defined as follows: 

• Wheel slip is the deviation of the wheel circumferential velocity from the driving speed. 

If a wheel is accelerated or braked to such an extent that the maximum static friction force is exceeded, 
the slip then increases until the wheels spin or locks. 

Two types of slip occur in practice. 

• Traction slip 

• Brake slip 

Traction slip can be reduced by the following measures. 

• DSC intervention by reduction of the engine torque. 

• Increase in the clutch torque to be transmitted by the xDrive 
(torque distribution to both drive axles). 

Brake slip can be reduced by the following measures. 

• ABS control operation (Antilock Brake System). 

In order to permit individual wheel control of the brake forces at a wheel during strong braking (ABS 
or DSC control operation) and avoid any influence on the other drive axle, the all-wheel drive clutch 
torque is decreased as required or completely reduced if necessary.

Calculation example for traction slip 

• Wheel circumferential velocity = 16.67 m/s (corresponds to approx. 60 km/h / 37 mph) 

• Driving speed = 13.89 m/s (corresponds to 50 km/h / 31 mph) 

Since the wheel circumferential velocity is higher than the driving speed for the specified values, 
the slip here is so-called traction slip.

8.6. Notes for Service 

• The vehicle must not be driven when the front drive shaft has been removed. 

• When carrying out work on a brake test stand, it is not necessary to take into 
account any all-wheel drive-specific points. 

(roller mode for testing the brake system is detected automatically.) 

• The vehicle must not be towed if only one axle is raised. 

• The oil filling of the transfer box is designed for the entire unit service life. 

However, a fault code entry with an oil change recommendation for the transfer 
box oil is stored when a mileage of 150,000 km /100,000 miles is exceeded. 

When refilling the transfer box oil, it is necessary to move the oil reservoir to the 
open position using the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 

• Various test plans are available in the BMW diagnosis system ISTA for Service. 

A 

The tire tread depth, tire rolling circumference as well as the tire manufacturer should be the same 
on the front and rear axles if possible, in order to ensure proper functioning of the xDrive. It is also 
recommended to use only tires that have been approved or recommended by BMW.

The joint of the front drive shaft is located on the output inside the transfer box. This is beneficial for 
the small package dimensions of the transfer box. The component sharing concept with other vehicle 
series can also be ensured in this way. 

The front drive shaft is inserted in the output with joint by means of a plug connection. A dust boot 
protects the connection against dirt. 

Since the output with joint is no longer fixed when the front drive shaft is removed, the vehicle must no 
longer be driven in this condition. The lacking guide would lead to an uncontrolled movement of the 
output when the vehicle is accelerated, thus causing damage to the transfer box.

The vehicle must not be driven when the front drive shaft has been removed.

8.6.1. Oil change for transfer box 

The oil filling of the transfer box is designed for the entire unit service life. This corresponds to 
a mileage of approximately 150,000 km /100,000 miles. A fault code entry with an oil change 
recommendation for the transfer box is stored when this mileage is exceeded. 

The transfer box does not have an oil drain plug. The oil filling to be renewed must be removed 
using an extractor unit. 

The new transfer box oil can be filled using an oil filler plug. 

In order to ensure that the entire oil filling has been exchanged, the oil reservoir must remain 
open for the duration of extraction and filling.

The Service employee can move the oil reservoir to the open position by means of the “Service 
function > Transfer box VTG > Oil change” in the BMW diagnosis system ISTA.

Due to the permitted component tolerances of the different components of the transfer box, the stroke 
of the ball ramp for closing the multidisc clutch in the transfer box differs in each case. However, these 
tolerances can be compensated by adapted control of the electric motor for closing the multidisc 
clutch. For this purpose, the tolerance class must be entered in the control unit for the transfer box. 

The respective tolerance is determined during production and entered on a type plate on the transfer 
box (see graphic above). 


The tolerance can be determined as follows in Service: 

• Reading off the tolerance class on the type plate on the transfer box. 

• Reading out the tolerance class via the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 

The four-digit classification code can be entered in the control unit for the transfer box VTG by means 
of a service function in BMW diagnosis system ISTA. This must be within a stored classification range 
in order to be accepted by the VTG control unit. 

The following table shows the complete classification range of the transfer box in the G12.
