1. Introduction 

1.1. Further information 

This product information introduces the new features of and adaptations to the display and controls. 
The focus is particularly on system-specific features. The vehicle-specific descriptions of the 
display and operating elements can be found in the product information G05 Displays and Controls 
and G15 Displays and Controls. 


1.2. Overview 

With the introduction of the new Head Unit High 3 (HU-H3), a new display and operating concept (ID7) 
is used at BMW. The head unit functions of the new user interface are displayed in the 12.3" Central 
Information Display. 

In the G12 the user interface ID5 was introduced. This was designed especially for touch operation. 

In the G30, ID6 with tiles, which can show the content in real time, was introduced shortly thereafter. 

ID7 is also designed for touch operation. The most obvious difference is the display of the tiles. With 
ID7 they are described as widgets and can be individually arranged.

The multi-functional instrument panel receives a completely new design and extended display 
options. The Central Information Display and the multi-functional instrument panel continue to form a 
single unit for ID7. 


Besides the controller and the touch operation, new gestures enable an even better way of 
performing certain functions. 

The voice control system is based on that of the G12. The hardware in the head unit is prepared fora 
functional enhancement in the near future.

1. Introduction 


The BMW Head-Up Display is also still one of the most important display instruments in the vehicle 
thanks to newly designed displays and a larger display field, as the customer can keep his eyes on the 
road whilst receiving important information. 


Showroom mode presents the customer a living vehicle with new animations in the showroom. 
Animations run in a continuous loop in the Central Information Display in order to arouse the 
customer's interest and to give an initial impression of the functions in the infotainment area.

2. Operating Elements 

2.1. Overview 

The latest generations of the operating elements are increasingly designed around several operating 
options. Some of the key operating options with ID7 (7th generation Drive) include the touch 
operation of the Central Information Display (CID), the option of natural voice input and gesture control. 
The controller with touch operation is also the central operating element in vehicles with ID7. 



Overview of operation of the previous generations 


2.2. Central Information Display with touch function 

In conjunction with the BMW Live Cockpit Professional (SA 6U3), a Central Information Display with 
a maximum screen diagonal of 12.3" or 10.25" is installed depending on the vehicle. The display 
resolution is 1920 x 720 pixels.

Both steering column switches (turn signal/high beam switch and the wash/wipe switch) lock when 
actuated. 

The right instrument cluster display (combo widget) including the on-board computer data is operated 
using a button on the turn signal/high beam switch. As the reset button is deleted in the instrument 
cluster, the functions of the reset button are also operated via the on-board computer button, such as 
resetting the trip distance.

Voice control is another way of operating some vehicle functions and services. As already known from 
the G12, it is voice control, which can be carried out using natural voice commands, e.g. "Take me 
home" or "Call my boss". 



Natural language understanding (NLU) 


If an Apple iPhone is connected to the head unit via Bluetooth (Apple CarPlay is not activated), with a 
long press on the voice input button (3 s) SIRI is activated. 


If no mobile phone is paired with the head unit, then with a long press on the voice input button the 
connection menu in the Central Information Display (CID) is opened.

Alexa 

A new option of voice input in the vehicle is the integration of Amazon Alexa in the vehicle. This 
function is currently only possible for vehicles with a Head Unit High 2 or Head Unit Basic 2 
from production date July 2016. An extension of the Alexa functions to the HU-H3 is planned for 
autumn 2018. More information about Amazon Alexa in Car can be found in the product information 

Infotainment 2018. 

More information about Natural Language Understanding (NLU) can be found in the product 
information G12 Navigation Systems. 


2.7. Controller 

The new generation of the controller has a new design. With the direct access keys of the controller it 
is a user interface with active haptic feedback, which depending on the position of the finger provides 
haptic feedback by pressing the respective button. The controller now has 8 instead of 7 direct access 
keys. The Apps menu (ConnectedDrive) has its own direct access key. The direct access key for 
ConnectedDrive on the radio operating facility is deleted. 

Input and operation via the touch control box is still possible. The touch recognition takes places in the 
head unit like in other vehicles.
