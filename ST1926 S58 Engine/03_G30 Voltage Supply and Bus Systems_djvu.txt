The FlexRay overview includes all engine versions and optional equipment. The DME (item 6) is used 
for 4 & 6-cylinder engines. On 8-cylinder engines the DME2 (item 2) is used. The terminating resistors 
for line termination are located in the DME control units and in the Body Domain Controller. 

The FlexRay has a data transfer rate of 10 MBit/s. 

2.2.5. Ethernet 

On the G30 the 2-wire OABR Ethernet (OPEN Alliance BroadR-Reach) from the G12 is used. 

The Ethernet variant with 5 lines (4 data lines and 1 activation line) is still used on the G30 by the 
OBD2 interface to the Body Domain Controller. 

Use of 2-wire OABR Ethernet on the G30 

The following control units are connected to the vehicle electrical system via 2-wire OABR Ethernet 
in the G30: 

• Active Cruise Control (ACC) 

• Camera-based driver support systems (KAFAS) 

• Top Rear Side View Camera (TRSVC) 

• Rear view camera (RFK)

The following control units are additionally connected via 2-wire OABR Ethernet in the G30: 

• Head unit 

• Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE) 

• Optional equipment system (SAS) 

• Telematic Communication Box 


Ethernet in the vehicle 

The standard "Open Alliance BroadR-Reach" (OABR Ethernet) has been specially developed as a 
new data transmission layer for use in vehicles. OABR Ethernet only requires an unshielded twisted 
two-wire connection. OABR Ethernet supports bidirectional 100 MBit/s communication between 2 
nodes. This means that both nodes can simultaneously send and receive at a data transfer rate of 
100 MBit/s. OABR Ethernet requires point-to-point networking. This means that the bus system is 
not split up between multiple nodes, as is the case e.g. with Controller Area Network (CAN) systems. 
Instead, Ethernet switches are used for the connection of further nodes. Today, Ethernet switches 
are integrated in the following control units: Body Domain Controller (BDC), Head Unit (HU), optional 
equipment system (SAS), Top Rear Side View Camera (TRSVC). An Ethernet switch (ENS) is used 
on the G30 depending on the vehicle equipment. In the event of failure of an Ethernet switch, all 
bus users connected by it are disconnected from the rest of the network and are no longer able to 
communicate via Ethernet. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, the control units are connected to the vehicle electrical 
system in different ways. 

On vehicles with Navigation, the data transfer takes place from the Head Unit High to the instrument 
cluster via an APIX data cable. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment an Ethernet switch may in some cases be required. 

A wake-up line may be required for control units that are only connected to the Ethernet and 
are not additionally connected to a body CAN. 

Control units on the Ethernet cannot be woken up via the bus. Instead, the control units are activated 
via the wake-up line or switched directly via terminal 15. As a result of the activation via a wake-up line, 
so-called partial network operation is also possible. In partial network operation, individual control units 
can switch to a rest state in different vehicle conditions. 

The Ethernet topology of the G30 is listed below. 

Ethernet topology with Head Unit High 

In the wiring diagram the connection of the Top Rear Side View Camera (TRSVC) control unit and 
rear view camera (RFK) is shown. In the vehicle, either TRSVC is installed for a vehicle with multiple 
cameras, or RFK for a vehicle with a rear view camera (standalone). 

On vehicles with Head Unit High, the Telematic Communication Box (TCB) and the Rear Seat 
Entertainment are directly connected to the head unit. The data transfer from the Head Unit High to 
the instrument cluster takes place via APIX. The instrument cluster does not require Ethernet. As a 
result, the Ethernet interfaces on the Body Domain Controller are sufficient, and no Ethernet switch 
(ENS) is required.

4.2.12. PCU with vehicle electrical system assistance measure 

Modern vehicles have a high energy consumption due to the many electrical consumers. As a result, 
there is a high demand on the battery particularly in phases in which the combustion engine is not 
running and the alternator supplies no energy (e.g. engine start/stop phases). 

In order to protect the vehicle battery, a DC/DC converter is installed in the Power Control Unit (PCU) 
and an auxiliary battery in the engine compartment in the G30. 

The preconditions for the direction of the energy management are calculated from the use of the 
vehicle. When the engine is running the auxiliary battery is charged from the conventional vehicle 
electrical system. During the phases in which the combustion engine is not running, e.g. automatic 
start/stop function, the energy is supplied from the auxiliary battery into the conventional vehicle 
electrical system. 

The Power Control Unit PCU contains a control unit which is connected to the PT-CAN2 and a DC/DC 
converter with a power of 500 W. 

On vehicles with the equipment electric active roll stabilization, this is supplied by the auxiliary battery 
in the engine compartment. 

4.2.13. 24 V Electronic Power Steering 

The greater weight of the engines in the G30 on vehicles with 8-cylinder engines results in a higher 
front axle load. This has the effect that the required power of the steering assist increases. Due to 
these high currents, it is necessary to increase the voltage supply of the EPS to 24 V. 

An auxiliary battery, separating element and a charging unit for the auxiliary battery are required for 
this. These components are installed in the luggage compartment of the G30. 

The charging unit monitors the state of charge and also charges the auxiliary battery using a DC/DC 
converter. The EPS is only supplied with 24 V once this relay has been activated. The EPS can also be 
operated with 12 V in the event of a fault.

5. Terminal Control 

5.1. Introduction 

The terminal control in the G30 is identical to the terminal control of the G12. In the G30, the vehicle 
is always in the right condition from the point of view of the customer. The terminals are controlled 
via a customer-oriented condition management. The terminal control is dependent on the driving 
conditions. 

5.2. Vehicle conditions 

The G30 vehicle may be in the following conditions: 

• PARKING (asleep) 

• RESIDING (awake) 

• DRIVING (ready) 

The different vehicle functions are possible depending on the relevant conditions. 

PARKING (asleep) 

• Customer not in the vehicle. 

• Vehicle secured or not used for a certain time. 

• Vehicle functions cannot be operated. 

RESIDING (awake) 

• Customer in the vehicle. 

• No driving readiness. 

• Functions that are relevant when the vehicle is stationary can be operated. 

DRIVING (ready) 

• Customer in the vehicle. 

• Driving readiness established. 

• All functions are available. 

The driving conditions are changed by condition management, taking into account the customer 
behavior. Additional information is also evaluated that may help to determine the vehicle condition, 
e.g.: 

• Door opening 

• Door closing 

• Operations in the vehicle

In the menu "Doors/Keys", an immediate change from the vehicle condition RESIDING to the vehicle 
condition PARKING can be activated. 

If this option is activated, then the system will immediately change to the vehicle condition PARKING 
when the driver's door is opened. The omission of the after-running period in the vehicle condition 
RESIDING saves energy. 


5.3. Power supply terminals 

Control units in the vehicle must be supplied with power only when they are needed. The following 
terminals are used in the G30: 

• Terminal 15N 

• Terminal 30B 

• Terminal 30F 

• Terminal 30 

Terminal 15N supplies control units which are needed only when driving and which may be needed to 
safely end a journey. After-run of 5 s starts at the transition from DRIVING to RESIDING. 

Terminal 30B is used to supply control units that are needed in the stationary mode RESIDING and for 
stationary functions where the customer is not in the vehicle. An after-run of 6 minutes starts at the 
transition from RESIDING to PARKING, and terminal 30B is then switched off. 

Terminal 30F is used to supply control units which must perform functions in PARKING condition. 
Terminal 30F is normally switched on in PARKING condition, but may be switched off due to faults in 
the vehicle electrical system. The terminal is switched off with an after-running period of 1 min if a fault 
is detected. 

Terminal 30 control units (e.g. alarm system) are always supplied with voltage and are also not 
switched off in the event of a fault.

Programming-analysis-diagnosis (PAD) mode 

The vehicle condition programming-analysis-diagnosis is still present for diagnosis. All terminals are 
switched on in this mode. This ensures that diagnosis can be performed with all control units. This 
vehicle condition is displayed in the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 

Activation of the PAD mode: 

• Operation of the start/stop button (three times within 0.8 s) + valid remote control or valid ID 
transmitter in the vehicle interior. 

• By the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 

The PAD mode is exited by pressing the start/stop button or by closing the diagnosis with the BMW 
diagnosis system ISTA. 


5.4. Partial network operation 

Today's premium vehicles contain up to 70 control units with well over 100 micro-controllers which 
are networked with each other. However, depending on the current vehicle condition or the vehicle 
user requirements, not all convenience and assistance systems may always be needed. 

It is possible to save energy, relieve the load on the battery and also prolong the battery life by targeted 
deactivation and activation on control units which are not needed, so-called selective partial network 
operation. 

If functions are not used or needed when driving, e.g.: 

• Seat adjustment 


5.4.1. Prerequisites for partial network operation 

The partial network in the Body Domain Controller calculates the partial network status on the basis 
of the current vehicle condition and the required functions. The control units that are not required are 
switched off by means of the corresponding bus messages. 

5.4.2. Prerequisites of control units for partial network operation 

Different transceivers are used in order to operate the partial network operation in control units. 

These transceivers are able to evaluate and interpret messages. This control unit remains switched 
off as long as any bus communication takes place without a valid wake-up event for the corresponding 
control unit being present. If a valid wake-up event for the corresponding control unit is sent on the 
bus, the transceiver can activate the voltage regulator of the micro-controller and the control unit starts 
up. The control unit is switched off by deactivation of the voltage regulator.
