in requirements for environmental protection, customer benefits and design render necessary 
continuous development of systems and components. Consequently, there may be discrepancies 
between the contents of this document and the vehicles available in the training course. 

This document basically relates to the European version of left hand drive vehicles. Some operating 
elements or components are arranged differently in right-hand drive vehicles than shown in the 
graphics in this document. Further differences may arise as the result of the equipment specification in 
specific markets or countries.

1. Exterior Lights 

1.1. Versions 

The following exterior light versions are offered for the G01: 

• LED headlights (Standard on the xDrive 30i) 

• LED headlights with cornering lights (OE 5A4 optional on xDrive 30i) 

• Adaptive full LED headlights (Standard on the M40i) (optional OE 552 on xDrive 30i).

1.5.2. Ground lights 

The ground lighting is integrated in the corresponding door modules. The LEDs of the ground lighting 
are activated by the Body Domain Controller (BDC). 

1.5.3. Light carpet 

The light source is integrated in the side sill so that it is invisible for the customer. The function can be 
realized in a very small installation space through the use of a multi-lens array system. A very flat angle 
of radiation is also possible. The graphic is superposed several times by the multi-lens array system 
and is therefore insensitive to dirt contamination. The light carpet is activated by the Body Domain 
Controller (BDC).

RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LED modules are used for the ambient lighting. 

The lighting for the ambient interior lighting is controlled via a separate LIN bus. The individual LED 
modules are connected via a local interconnect network bus. The LED modules are connected in 
series to the LIN bus around the vehicle. 

If the LIN bus is interrupted at a certain point or the micro controller on the LED is faulty, then further 
light transmittance is interrupted at this point. A search for the fault must be carried out at the location 
where the last LED illuminates.

4.2.2. Function 

The function of the central locking system of the G01 is based on that of current BMW models. All 
functions relevant for the central locking system are controlled by the Body Domain Controller. The 
function is as follows: 

• The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the remote control receiver. 

• The signal causes the BDC to activate the central locking system and the interior lighting. 

• The BDC evaluates the status of all door contacts of the tailgate and the hotel position switch. 

• The status of the central locking system button is also evaluated by the BDC. The BDC 

activates the central locking system, depending on the status. 

• The BDC is responsible for activation of the central locking system and the drive for automatic 
soft-close in the tailgate. 

• Activation of fuel filler flap unlocking is also performed by the BDC.

The alarm system in the G01 is equipped with an ultrasonic interior movement detector for monitoring 
the passenger compartment. The ultrasonic interior movement detector (USIS) is fully integrated in 
the roof function center (FZD). 

The door contacts, engine compartment lid contact switch and the opening of the tailgate are 
monitored by the Body Domain Controller. As soon as a status changes, the ultrasonic interior 
movement detector receives this information via the K-CAN2. If the alarm system is activated, the siren 
with tilt alarm sensor is activated by the control unit in the event of a break-in. 

The siren with tilt alarm sensor SINE is connected with the roof function center via a local LIN bus. 

The status of the alarm system is displayed via the LED at the interior mirror.

Steering column switch cluster (SZL) 


The turn signal/high beam switch on the G01 engages mechanically in the corresponding position 
when operated. The return is mechanical via the steering wheel. 

All signals of the buttons and switches of the multifunction steering wheel (MFL) and the steering 
column switch cluster (SZL) are transmitted via Local Interconnect Network to the Body Domain 
Controller (BDC).

The instrument cluster receives the value of the ambient temperature from the outside temperature 
sensor and makes this available via the PT-CAN. The Body Domain Controller evaluates the signal 
and triggers the activation of the mirror heating via the local interconnect network bus. The control 
of the heater output is dependent on the ambient temperature and the switch position of the driving 
experience switch. 

The mirror servomotors are activated by the mirror electronics. The request for adjusting the exterior 
mirror is received by the mirror electronics via the local interconnect network bus.
