F97/F98 Complete Vehicle 

1. Introduction 


The BMW M family is being extended by the addition of another series in the BMW X family. The F97 
and F98 will debut as BMW X3 M and BMW X4 M in the sports activity vehicle and sports activity 
coupe sectors. As is already the case with their bigger brothers, the F85 and F86, the F97 and F98 will 
be equipped with M TwinPower turbocharged engine, M Sport automatic transmission, xDrive, Vertical 
Dynamics Management (VDM) and M Servotronic. 

The new BMW X3 M and BMW X4 M will be launched onto the market in the second quarter of 2019. 


1.1. M history 

In 1972 the then BMW Motorsport started out with the legendary Ml. For over 45 years today's BMW 
M GmbH has been developing BMW M vehicles with a motor-sport pedigree based on the standard 
production models. 

The typical M driving experience was also made to come alive for the first time in the Sports Activity 
Vehicle/Sports Activity Coupe segment in July 2009. The E70 M and E71 M were the first BMW 
M models with M TwinPower turbo engine, M Sport automatic transmission, xDrive, Dynamic 
Performance Control, Dynamic Drive and run-flat tires.

Cooling air routing 

The air ducting is identical on the F97 and F98. 

The air inlet areas for the required cooling air on the front bumper panel have been enlarged and 
optimized in such a way that there is more air inlet area available for cooling air compared with the G01/ 
G02. There is an adapted air duct both for the center radiator assembly including low-temperature 
radiator and for the two discrete radiators in the wheel arches. This design feature has had a positive 
effect on the cooling capacity for charge air cooling, engine cooling and transmission cooling.

3.2.4. Underbody and thermal protection 

Underbody 

The stiffening plate has been carried over from the G01/G02. The engine underguard is a new part 
with an integrated air outlet for the additional, horizontal, forward-mounted engine oil cooler. The air 
ducting for the brake system has been adapted on the F97/F98, featuring new air ducts between the 
bumper panel and the inner wheel arch liner. 

In order to achieve an additional optimization in terms of reducing the lift on the F97/F98, M-specific 
air guides in front of the front wheels that differ geometrically from the G01/G02 have been developed 
in a wind tunnel. 

The center underbody trim panel has been adapted specifically for the M model to achieve optimum 
airflow over the protruding cooling fins of the aluminum transmission sump (BMW AG base model: 
plastic oil sump). 

Thermal protection 

• Additional heat insulation on the right engine subframe (turbocharger) 

• Exhaust system heat insulation as a new part to the right of the automatic transmission 

• Additional exhaust system heat insulation for fuel tank and the front prop shaft universal joint 

• Additional exhaust system heat insulation above the rear silencer.

4.2. Transmission 

4.2.1. M automatic transmission 

As already used on the F85/F86 and F90, the F97/F98 features an M automatic transmission with 
Drivelogic designated the GM8HP76Z. This is referred to as M8HP76 in the following sections.

T018-1635 






F97/F98 Complete Vehicle 

4. Powertrain 


With the M8HP76 M Sport Steptronic transmission, which is based on the BMW AG 8HPTU2 gearbox, 
customers benefit from significantly improved gear shift responsiveness and even further optimized 
control of the converter lock-up clutch. 

This has been made possible by the further development of converter technology to effectively damp 
rotational irregularities in the drivetrain with a turbine torsional vibration damper. As a result, the 
operating ranges in which the converter lock-up clutch has to be controlled are reduced even further 
because the converter lock-up clutch is fully engaged in the vast majority of driving situations. This 
provides for an even more direct connection of the M8HP76 transmission to the complete drivetrain, 
resulting in an even sportier driving experience and reduced fuel consumption. 

The power transmission capacity of the torque converter has been adapted to the S58B30T0 engine. 

In the F97/F98 the “Idle coasting” function known from the BMW AG vehicles is not implemented. 
However, the M8HP76 supports, as known from the BMW AG vehicles, the “ConnectedShift” 
function.

4.2.2. Transmission oil cooling 

The plastic transmission sump has been replaced by an aluminum version with larger cooling fins and 
the opening point of the transmission oil thermostat lowered, thereby improving the cooling of the 
M8HP76 transmission. 

A transmission oil cooler with a thermostat is used to cool the M8HP76 on the F97/F98. This 
additional transmission oil cooler, which is designed as a plate heat exchanger, operates according to 
the oil-to-air heat exchanger principle and is installed vertically in front of the radiator assembly.

Some of the external pipes and hoses carrying transmission oil to the supplementary transmission oil 
cooler have had their cross-sectional area optimized. This results in a greater oil flow rate, translating 
into more efficient cooling of the M automatic transmission. 

The thermostat of the transmission oil cooler starts opening at 76 °C (169 °F) and is fully open at 
96 °C (205 °F). 

4.2.3. M gear selector lever/M GWS 

The M automatic transmission is operated using the M gear selector lever (M GWS) or the shift 
paddles on the steering wheel. 

The gear selector switch used on the F97/F98 is a combined M gear selector switch with integrated 
Drivelogic switch and parking lock button as familiar from the BMW M5. 

The M-specific shift pattern, as used for the M double-clutch transmissions, was retained for the 
M gear selector switch.

Drivelogic 

A rocker switch is used on the F97/F98 for changing the transmission mode up or down. 

After each change between manual mode and Drive mode, the last selected driving program is active. 
After each engine start driving program 1 is active in Drive mode. 

In automated mode, all forward gears are shifted automatically. Kickdown is triggered by depressing 
the accelerator pedal beyond the pressure point. 

It is possible to choose and change between an automatic “D mode” and a sequential “Manual 
mode”. In each mode there are 3 driving programs, which can be selected and activated using the 

"Drivelogic switch". 

D mode/Drive mode 

Three driving programs are available for selection: 

1: Efficient driving, comfort shifting time 
2: Fast driving, sport shifting times 
3: Sports mode/Sports shift point 


23 








F97/F98 Complete Vehicle 

4. Powertrain 


Manual mode/sequential mode 

The gears can be shifted manually at the appropriate road speed and engine revs by means of"+" 
and gearshift paddles on the steering wheel or by moving the gear selector lever "forward" or 
"back". The selected gear is maintained even when the engine speed limitation is reached, but an 
automatic downshift is performed when the vehicle drops below the gear-specific minimum driving 
speed. 

When manual mode is selected for the first time after a change of terminal status (engine restart), the 
last Drivelogic level used is active. 

Three driving programs are also available here for selection: 

1: Comfortable, smooth gearshifts in all driving conditions 

2: Sporty, fast gearshifts, light gearshift jolts permitted at higher engine loads and speeds 
3: Maximum sporty shift speed and gearshifts are the requirement for the activation of Launch Control. 
Using the highest program, i.e. 3, does not require the M DSC to be deactivated. 

4.2.4. Launch Control 

A 

During the first 5000 km (3100 miles) run-in distance, the Launch Control must not be used. 

The Launch Control is released at the factory. Release of the Launch Control is no longer restricted to 
the 2000 km (1200 miles)running-in check. 

Premature wear occurs as a result of the high load on the vehicle components when using Launch 
Control. 


Launch Control 

Function: Launch Control enables optimal acceleration when driving off on a non-skid roadway. 

Sequence 

Precondition/Action 

1 . 

The vehicle must be stationary, the engine running and at operating 
temperature (approx. 10 km (6 mph) warm-up journey). 

2. 

The M Dynamic Stability Control (M DSC) is deactivated. (4WD) 

3. 

The manual mode and the third Drivelogic driving program are selected. 

4. 

The brake pedal is gently pressed with the left foot and held. 

5. 

The accelerator pedal is depressed fully and held in this position. 

6. 

In the M instrument cluster a flag symbol must appear (if not, check notes and 
steps 1-5). 

7. 

An optimum engine speed for pulling away is adjusted. 

8. 

The left foot is taken off the brake within 5 seconds. 


24 










F97/F98 Complete Vehicle 

4. Powertrain 


Effect 


• Launch Control automatically shifts up using the shortest possible gearshift times and 
performance-optimized shift points as long as the driver keeps the accelerator pedal fully 
depressed. 

• The start flag in the instrument cluster remains active. 

A renewed Launch Control start is possible as long as the transmission oil temperature satisfies the 
preconditions for this. 

Automatic deactivation 

• The driver leaves (even if only briefly) the accelerator pedal full-load range during acceleration. 


A_ 

A manual intervention in the automatic upshift, for example via the gearshift paddles on the steering 
wheel or the gear selector lever, does not interrupt the Launch Control process. 


If one of these preheating/precooling conditions is breached, it is not possible to activate the Launch 
Control. 

Also at excessive transmission oil temperature (e.g. repeat Launch Control or race-like start), activation 
is blocked up until an acceptable temperature threshold is reached. 

The start flag goes out with every deactivation and the automatic forced upshift is cancelled. 

A 

Premature wear occurs as a result of the high load of the vehicle with use of the launch control. 


4.2.5. Emergency gearbox release 

A_ 

A mechanical emergency transmission release is available and can be accessed through the vehicle 
underbody. In addition, an electronic emergency gearbox release is implemented as it is in automatic 
transmissions of the BMW AG vehicles. If the vehicle needs to be towed, the guidance in the owner's 
manual for the vehicle must be followed. 


Release is possible if the starter motor can crank the engine. Before the parking lock is released, the 
parking brake must be applied in order to prevent the vehicle rolling away. 

Sequence 

Precondition/Action 

1 . 

Engage selector lever position N. 

2. 

Press and hold the brake. 

3. 

Press the start/stop button (the starter motor must start up audibly). 

4. 

Keep the start/stop button pressed.

7. 

Release the start/stop button and the selector lever. 

8. 

Release the brake as soon as the starter motor stops. 


Maneuver the vehicle out of the danger area and then secure to prevent it from rolling away. Observe 
the additional information in the owner's manual for the vehicle. 


4.2.6. Service information 

For work required on the oil circuit of the automatic transmission, for example after an accident, or if 
the oil circuit has to be opened owing to a repair, there must be maximum cleanliness. They include: 

• Optimal cleaning of the outer oil circuit areas before disassembly of the components or 
opening the oil circuit. 

• Immediate closure of openings and lines after disassembly without delay and using clean 
original plugs. Do not use unsealed components or replacement parts of the oil circuit without 
checking for cleanliness and where possible competent repair. 

• The work bay in which an automatic transmission is opened up must be absolutely clean and 
protected from dirt contamination, including during work interruptions, e.g. by means of an 
adequate, clean and lint-free cover. 

Lifetime oil filling 

At present, as is the case with the F85/F86 and F90 with automatic transmission, a transmission oil 
change at 2000 km (1200 mile running-in check) and at every 3rd engine oil change is not required for 
the F96/F97 with M automatic transmission. 


4.3. M xDrive 

"High-performance dynamic handling on the one hand and the everyday usability of an SUV/SAV 
on the other" is how we could summarize the typical M concept approach in which the individual 
drivetrain components are perfectly matched with the M xDrive system. That enables the new BMW 
X3 M and BMW X4 M to have the same familiar precise sports handling whether being driven on the 
race track or the public road. In addition, they are also a delight to drive even in unpleasant weather 
conditions such as rain and snow or off road thanks to noticeable extra traction and controllability 
right up to the limits of handling stability. The agile rear-oriented design is achieved by allowing the M 
xDrive to bring the front axle to bear only when the rear wheels have reached their limits and additional 
traction force is required. Even when adopting a very vigorous driving style using a lot of power, the 
new BMW X3 M and BMW X4 M with M xDrive show themselves to be predictable and effortless to 
control for the driver, so that the outstanding performance of the vehicles can be experienced even 
more intensely.

4.3.1. Four-wheel drive 

The M xDrive system used on the F97/F98 is based on the all-wheel drive system of the G12 with the 
ATC13 transfer box and has been carried over from the F90. 

The torque generated by the engine is stepped up in the automatic transmission and is supplied 
via the transmission output shaft to the transfer box. The transfer box forming the next stage in the 
drivetrain has the task of varying the torque distribution between the front and rear wheels across the 
full range from 0:100% to 100:0% as demanded by the driving situation. Since a rigid connection of 
the rear axle with the front axle is not possible due to possible differences in the wheel speeds, there 
is a multidisc clutch inside the transfer box. The multidisc clutch performs the task of variable torque 
distribution between the two drive axles. 

General information on BMW xDrive can be found in the product information publication "ST 1501 G12 
Drivetrain".

• The vehicle must not be driven when the front propeller shaft has been removed. 

• When carrying out work on a brake test stand, it is not necessary to take into account any all¬ 
wheel drive-specific points. 

(roller mode for testing the brake system is detected automatically.) 

• The vehicle must not be towed if only one axle is raised. 

• The oil filling of the transfer box is designed for the entire unit service life. 

However, a fault memory entry with an oil change recommendation for the transfer box oil is 
stored when a usage of 150,000 km / 9300 miles is exceeded. 

When refilling the transfer box oil, it is necessary to move the oil partition to the open position 
using the BMW ISTA diagnosis system. 

• Various test plans are available in the BMW diagnosis system ISTA for Service. 

A_ 

The tire tread depth as well as the tire manufacturer should be the same on the front and rear axles if 
possible in order to ensure proper functioning of the xDrive. It is also advisable to only use tires that 
have been approved or recommended by BMW M. 


4.3.4. Lifetime oil filling 

The oil filling of the transfer box is designed for the entire unit service life. This corresponds to a usage 
of approximately 150,000 km / 9300 miles. A fault code entry with an oil change recommendation for 
the transfer box is stored when this mileage is exceeded. 

The transfer box does not have an oil drain plug. The oil filling to be renewed must be removed using 
an extractor unit. 


The new transfer box oil can be filled using an oil filler plug. 

In order to ensure that the entire oil filling has been exchanged, the oil bulkhead must remain open for 
the duration of extraction and filling.

4.3.5. Active M differential 

The active M differential on the rear axle is an integral part of the M xDrive. 

This electronically/electromechanically controlled M rear differential lock was developed specifically 
for the F10 M5 and is also used on the F06/F12/F13 M6, F80/F82/F83/F87, F90 and now on the new 
F97/F98. 

The active M differential has been reworked for the F97/F98, which specifically involved adapting the 
rear differential housing to the rear suspension subframe of the F97/F98. 

The M rear axle differential, size HAG 225 (crown wheel 0 225 mm), is used with a M rear axle 
differential lock. The system designation is "M regulated rear differential lock" and accordingly the 
control unit designation is M GHAS. 

The gear ratio of the rear axle differential HAG 225 is 3.154:1. 

This M rear axle differential can be recognized by an aluminum oil sump assembled from below and an 
electric motor which is visible from the outside. 

The HAG 225 weighs 43 kg.

Demand-controlled lock 

The lock is a demand-controlled rear axle differential lock which is active in the following situations: 

• Pullaway 

• Differential speed at the rear axle for straight-ahead driving under tension due to various 
coefficients of friction, left/right 

• M dynamic cornering tensioned 

• Power oversteer (slight steering drift in MDM mode) 

• Stabilization in coasting/overrun mode. 

Traction, handling and driving stability are optimized by adjusting a defined differential speed or 
differential torque at the rear axle. 

The regulated M rear axle differential lock works with a position-controlled electric motor and a ball 
ramp. 

4.3.6. Structure/Function 

The lock-up torque is generated by a multidisc clutch. The necessary axial pressure is applied to the 
multidisc clutch by the position-controlled direct current motor by means of gears and a ball ramp 
mechanism. The clutch package operates between the expansion tank housing (steel outer discs) and 
the right output (steel inner discs with carbon friction lining).

Differential housing (connected to outer discs) 


The electric motor (1) is bolted onto the housing and the pressure plate fixed to the 2nd half of the ball 
ramp (5) in the housing. The mobile components of the ball ramp (2, 3 and 4) generate the necessary 
axial displacement of the pressure disc (5). These components are not subject to the differential 
transmission rotation and are disconnected from the rotating components by an axial needle bearing 
( 6 ). 

The components with the index 6 to 18 belong to the differential and rotate proportional to the rear 
axle gear speeds. 

The lock is effected between the right output (16) and the differential housing (18) and counteracts a 
difference in speed between the output bevel gears (16 and 17). The disc spring (11) opens the lock 
when the engine is not supplied with current. 

4.3.7. System information 

The M DSC control unit evaluates the dynamic handling characteristics parameters made available 
by other control units via the FlexRay data bus and determines the lock-up torque to be applied. The 
M DSC control unit can also request separate and higher-level locking interventions to stabilize the 
vehicle both when the M DSC is activated and deactivated. 

The position-controlled direct current motor is activated directly by the power electronics of the 
M GHAS control unit with vehicle voltage via a pulse-width-modulated signal. The frequency is 
approximately 4 kHz and the maximum current level is 30 A. 

To determine the position and the direction of rotation of the electric motor it is equipped with 2 hall 
effect sensors.

Electric motor location determination 

To determine the position of the electric motor, 2 hall effect sensors in the engine are evaluated. 

To calculate the characteristic curve for lock-up torque over motor position, recalibration is performed 
at regular intervals to compensate for wear in the clutch. 

To be able to assign a certain position of the servomotor a certain coupling lock-up torque and to take 
the wear influences into account while doing so, a reference run is performed after the vehicle engine 
is switched off. During this reference run the engine is subjected to a defined current level. The lock¬ 
up torque of 0 Nm is assigned to the resulting position.

Temperature monitoring 

A total of 3 temperature sensors are installed. The temperature of the control unit (driver output stage), 
the temperature of the electric motor and the transmission oil temperature are monitored. 

The temperature thresholds are: 

• Control unit 85 °C (185 °F) 

• Electric motor 160 °C (320 °F) 

• Oil temperature 190 °C (374 °F) 


4.3.8. Service information 

• If the M GHAS control unit is replaced, coding (activation of a vehicle-related characteristic 
curve) and then initial calibration are necessary, after which the fault memory must be erased. 

• After the replacement of the entire M rear axle differential a calibration must be performed and 
then the fault memory must be deleted. 

• If the electric motor, the electric motor and intermediate gearing or the oil temperature sensor 
is replaced, erasing the fault memory is all that is required. 

The rear differential fluid is currently replaced at 2000 km (1200 mile running-in check) and every 3rd 
engine oil change. 

A 

Because of the change of clutch plate material to one with carbon content on the F90 and F97/F98, 
a new differential fluid is used. The initial filling is with Fuchs Titan 5037B. 


A_ 

Current rear axle differential box oil recommendations and capacities can be found in the current 
documentation of the BMW workshop information systems. 


A_ 

If, due to a fault, the M GHAS lock function is switched off or fails, a blocked differential is automatically 
reopened as the lock function is not self-locking. The driver is warned/informed and the following 
effects can be expected: 

1. Deterioration of traction with dynamic driving style and low coefficients of friction, 
particularly with different coefficients of friction, left/right. 

2. Possible deterioration of stability in dynamic driving situations.

5.1.1. Steering 

Within the framework of the EfficientDynamics measures for the F97/F98, the steering used is a rack- 
and-pinion steering with electrical steering wheel support “M Servotronic based on an EPS”. 

For power assistance during steering an electric motor is mounted parallel to the rack on the steering 
gear housing with the power transmitted via a ball screw.

The M Servotronic (M EPS) is has been developed independently for the F97/F98. All components of 
the M Servotronic (M EPS) have been developed specifically for the F97/F98. With this measure the 
development of the steering was able to be coordinated to the typical M properties. Special attention 
was paid here to the typical M features:

• Direct steering sensation 

• Driving condition feedback 

• M dynamic driving in the limit range 

The ratio of M Servotronic (M EPS) has been adapted to the F97/F98; of particular note is the fact after 
an eighth of a turn of the steering wheel the rack ratio increases by 8%.

5.1.2. M Servotronic 

The Servotronic function familiar from conventional hydraulic power-steering systems is also used on 
the M Servotronic (M EPS) and is available as standard on the F97/F98. It is a M Servotronic, which 
functions according to the same operating principle as in production vehicles. The difference in the 


46 

























F97/F98 Complete Vehicle 

5. Chassis and Suspension 

M Servotronic is that 3 stages can be selected in comparison to 2 stages in the production vehicles, 
and it has a separate button in the M driving dynamics button panel in the center console. Using the 
button or via the M1/M2 buttons, the driver can switch between "Comfort", "Sport" and "Sport+". 

Here the corresponding characteristic curve is activated and in Sport direction the power steering 
support is also noticeably withdrawn. The program selection can also be preconfigured in the head 
unit HU and selected using the M1/M2 buttons on the steering wheel. 

M drive dynamic control switch, program description, M Servotronic: 

• “COMFORT”: Focus on light and comfortable steering torques with perfect feedback from the 
road surface at the same time. 

• "SPORT": Greater rise in the steering force and perceptibly more feedback for sporty M 
dynamic driving, both for every day use and at the dynamic driving limit. 

• "SPORT+": Even greater rise in the steering force and high steering force level for the greatest 
possible feedback and clear sporty steering sensation. 


5.1.3. Steering angle sensor 

The information on the steering angle in the F97/F98 is not recorded by the Electronic Power Steering 
(EPS) and not via a separate sensor on the steering wheel and instead is computed based on the 
motor position angle of the EPS motor in relation to the steering wheel. 

The EPS delivers the position of the rack via FlexRay to the M Dynamic Stability Control (M DSC). 
During this process, the EPS calculates the absolute position of the rack based on the current motor 
position of the EPS motor and the number of complete revolutions performed by the motor starting 
from the zero position (straight-ahead driving position). 

Taking this position as the starting point, the M Dynamic Stability Control (M DSC) determines the 
wheel-specific steering angle among other things using the stored ratio parameters (rack to wheel- 
specific steering angle) and transmits this via FlexRay. This wheel-specific steering angle is used 
by the M Dynamic Stability Control (M DSC) among other things as a reference variable for internal 
control functions. 

In cases where the absolute value is not available from the EPS (loss of terminal 30, flash process), the 
absolute value is determined through interaction between the M Dynamic Stability Control (M DSC) 
and EPS using an adaption function in which the steering wheel is turned from end stop to end stop 
(e.g. straight-ahead position -> left -> right -> straight-ahead position).

The M compound brake provides even greater braking power than the sports brake offered on the 
G01/G02 BMW X3/X4 M40i. In a direct comparison it also offers: 

• Reduction in the vehicle weight, resulting in improved agility and dynamics, accelerating ability 
and fuel consumption 

• Reduction in the rotating mass, resulting in improved accelerating ability, response and 
handling 

• Increased fading stability and greater thermal resistance 

• Perforated disc ring, sports-style look, optimized response characteristics in the wet 

• Usage of intelligent lightweight construction 

• Technology transfer from M sport 

• Unique, authentic M design.

The front brake is entirely specific to the F97/F98. It is a large, perforated M compound brake disc 
combined with a four-piston fixed caliper. The brake disc diameter is 47 mm larger than that of the 
G01/G02 M40i. The exterior of all brake calipers is blue metallic in color with the M logo.

The diameter of the rear perforated M compound brake disc is 25 mm larger than that of the G01/G02 
BMW M40i. Apart from the blue paint finish, the rear brake caliper including the electromechanical 
parking brake has been carried over from the standard production models and is a single-piston 
floating caliper. 

The characteristic maps of the M Dynamic Stability Control have been adapted specifically to the 
M design. 

M carbon ceramic brakes

A 

Brake noise 

• Humming of the BMW M compound brake disc at high speeds 

• Squeaking brakes shortly before coming to a halt 

• Cracking noises from the area of the BMW M compound brake discs when hot. 

Explain to the customer at this point that such noises occurring temporarily or in specific situations are 
inherent in the design and do not represent a quality problem. They are a consequence of the special 
performance of the brakes and do not pose any danger or risk of damage. 

Point out that the customer can use his/her braking technique to help prevent the noises occurring or 
ensure they quickly disappear again. For example, after washing the vehicle it is important to dry the 
brakes out by braking (braking a few times from 50 km/h (31 mph) to 0 is sufficient). Or that the brakes 
can have a tendency to squeak if they go through long periods when they are only exposed to light 
braking, which is why braking hard a few times can help out (= higher brake temperature). After driving 
the vehicle very hard and subjecting the braking system to high loads (high brake disc temperatures) 
the driver should try to make sure that the brakes are able to cool down while the vehicle is moving 
and not to keep the brakes on the first time the vehicle comes to a stop. As a result of the increased 
material transfer from the brake pads to the disc after very hard driving, a humming noise can occur 
which disappears again after a short time. 

Brake dust 

Is an effect of a high-performance braking system. The BMW M models are high-performance 
vehicles which are designed for fast and dynamic driving and embody a racing pedigree. The specially 
designed brakes make possible the high braking performance required by the vehicle and in so doing 
generate larger amounts of dust due to the greater levels of friction. The brake dust tells the customer 
that his/her BMW M vehicle has been driven in an appropriate manner. What is important is to ensure 
that it is regularly removed by washing the vehicle, as otherwise it will eat into the surface of the wheel.

The components of the above-listed wheel/tire combinations have been developed specially for the 
F97/F98. This can be recognized by the star on the outer side of the tire, among other things. 

Other combinations may have a negative effect on the performance and the driveability of the F97/F98 
and lead to forfeiture of the operating licence with forfeiture of the insurance cover. 


5.4. Driving dynamics systems 

The M-specific coordination of the driving dynamics (longitudinal, transverse and vertical) was 
effected on the Nurburgring Nordschleife. The main criteria were handling and the lap times. 

5.4.1. Vertical Dynamics Management 

The EDO function integrated in the M vertical dynamic platform (M VDP) controls the adjustable 
dampers. 

The drivability can be shifted toward the individual driving dynamics direction via the EDO button 
in the M drive dynamic control switch on the center console. The program selection can also be 
preconfigured in the head unit HU and selected using the corresponding M1/M2 buttons on the 
steering wheel. 

Adaptive M suspension on Competition model (Dynamic Damper Control) 

There are no EDC control valves as familiar from the G01/G02 fitted on the outside of the shock 
absorbers but instead typical M-only internal control valves. The shock absorbers have been 
developed with the supplier ZF Sachs and the system adapted to the F97/F98. 

The EDC works with infinitely variable valves in the absorbers. The hydraulic oil flow is controlled 
via electromagnetic control valves. It is thus possible to make available the damping force actually 
required at all times. The infinitely variable control principle was introduced for the first time in the E65 
and has consistently been further developed.

The following variables, among others, were processed into the corresponding control variables in 
the M Vertical Dynamic Platform (M VDP): vertical acceleration, wheel speed M DSC, steering angle 
change M EPS, angle change rate ACSM and damper piston speed . 

In addition, the ride height between the wheel suspension and body is used as a control, reference and 
load variable and is read off of the ride height sensors of the headlights. There is one sensor each at 
the front and rear. They operate on the basis of the potentiometer principle and their signal is made 
available to the M Vertical Dynamic Platform (M VDP).

System function 

The Electronic Damper Control (EDC) is a variable, electronically controlled shock absorber 
adjustment system that controls the vertical dynamics. The front axle damper and rear axle damper 
can be controlled independent of each other. The EDC adapts the damping forces of the shock 
absorber more or less instantly to the changing road or driving conditions. 

The EDC consists of: 

• 4 continuously variable shock absorbers with coupled rebound/compression stage adjustment 

• M VDP control unit 

• 2 vertical acceleration sensors on the front axle (swivel bearing) for determining the wheel 
movement 

• 2 vertical acceleration sensors on the rear axle (wheel bearing) for determining the wheel 
movement 

• 2 ride height sensors 

• Body Domain Controller as gateway. 


59 












F97/F98 Complete Vehicle 

5. Chassis and Suspension 

The sensors in the vehicle permanently measure: 

• The body and vertical acceleration 

• The current lateral and longitudinal acceleration 

• The vehicle speed 

• The steering wheel position. 

Based on this measured data, the M VDP control unit calculates the control commands to be sent 
to the electromagnetic valves in the shock absorbers for each individual wheel according to the road 
profile and driving situation. This means that the damping forces will always be applied according to 
requirements. 

This improves ride comfort and also increases driving dynamics. 

This improves the vehicle's: 

• Suitability for long-distance journeys 

• Enhanced body stability and agility 

• Improves driving safety by minimizing wheel load fluctuations 
and reducing the stopping distance. 


Adaptive suspension (EDC) button options 

The EDC button is connected with the Body Domain Controller (BDC) via the LIN bus. The Body 
Domain Controller (BDC) forwards this information via the FlexRay bus to M VDR 

The Dynamic Damper Control on the F97/F98 offers the options "Comfort", "Sport" and "Sport+". 

All three programs feature M dynamic control on the F97/F98. 

Note: 

In the first E92/E90 M3 models, the EDC had the three options, "Comfort", "Normal" and "Sport", 
whereby with the "Sport" option there is no M dynamic control, but the dampers are set very hard. 
This is primarily suited for a cone slalom on an even surface. However, the fastest possible times on 
normal roads cannot be achieved with the "Sport" option. The E93 M3 was dynamically controlled in 
"Sport" mode on standard production models upwards, and all succeeding models including the F97/ 
F98 are dynamically controlled in "Sport+" mode. 


60 



F97/F98 Complete Vehicle 

5. Chassis and Suspension 

M drive dynamic control switch, EDC program description: 

• "Comfort" mode on the F97/F98 delivers a distinctly comfortable ride to satisfy any demands 
for comfort on the part of BMW X3 M or BMW X4 M customers. The basic damper hardness 
is comfortable without forfeiting safe handling in an emergency (such as during rapid evasive 
maneuvers). 

• "Sport" supports a demanding M dynamic and sporty driving style with increased basic 
damper hardness and sufficient remaining comfort (for example on country roads or bumpy 
racetracks such as the Nurburgring Nordschleife). 

• "Sport+" on the F97/F98 now also means that M dynamic control comes into effect, with 
the basic shock absorber stiffness being further increased relative to "Normal". It may 
therefore also be the best selection for the fastest times on different route profiles on very 
even surfaces, unlike a route profile similar to a "cone-lined slalom". 


5.4.2. M Dynamic Stability Control (M DSC) 

The M Dynamic Stability Control (M DSC) represents the longitudinally dynamic system network. This 
control unit coordinates the interaction between the M Servotronic, engine control, M VTG and the 
regulated M rear axle differential lock M GFIAS.

5.4.3. Integrated actuation (longitudinal transverse dynamics) 

What is known as integrated actuation is used on the F97/F98. The integrated actuation in the M DSC 
comprises the DSC, which is responsible for the longitudinal dynamics, and an transverse dynamics 
management control unit (QDM) integrated in the DSC control unit. This means that the current 
driver's choice is distributed to the appropriate actuator via this M DSC control unit. That results in the 
following benefits when driving the F97/F98: 

• Excellent traction, especially on low coefficients of friction 

• M-specific agility and playfully intuitive control of the vehicle 

• Superiority in every day use 

• Variable functions of the M xDrive are possible, depending on the driver's choice. 

The actuator and control units that are used depending on the driver's choice are:

5.4.4. M dynamic mode and M DSC OFF mode 

In M Dynamic Mode (MDM) the control threshold of the brake interventions is expanded/raised and the 
engine power reduction by ASC is applied significantly later. This enables driver-oriented dynamic and 
sporty driveability. The "M DSC OFF" mode is described separately in one of the following chapters. 

The DTC button is connected with the Body Domain Controller (BDC) via the LIN bus. The Body 
Domain Controller (BDC) forwards this information via the FlexRay bus to M Dynamic Stability Control 
(M DSC).

Explanation

M2 Button 


The activation of an M configuration is displayed by a Ml or M2 symbol in the instrument cluster. The 
corresponding symbol flashes if, for example, ABS, M DSC or M xDrive intervene upon activation of 
the request or if a malfunction exists in the system. A renewed activation is only possible after the 
intervention is completed or the malfunction has been eliminated. 

During a journey, the retrieved configuration can be changed at any time. The corresponding M driving 
dynamics control switch must be operated for this purpose. The Ml or M2 symbol in the instrument 
cluster goes out. 

An efficient/comfortable configuration is set by default in the factory for the Ml button and a sporty 
configuration for the M2 button. This setting can be adapted in the M configuration menu to the 
customer's needs and also reset again to the factory setting. Each M button is individually configurable 
and the overall configuration is also assigned to the vehicle remote control being used. 

The following functions and configurations can be selected and set: 

M Dynamic Stability Control (M DSC) 

• ON Maximum possible driving stability with 4WD 

• MDM Reduced stabilizing intervention with 4WD Sport. Permits driving 
with a higher lateral and longitudinal acceleration on dry and wet roadways 

• OFF Stability control switched off. ABS control remains active. 


M DSC OFF 

When M DSC is deactivated, the M xDrive menu is automatically displayed in the head unit HU in the 
Central Information Display (CID). In the M DSC OFF mode, the customer can select 1 of 2 M xDrive 
modes:

Configuration quick save 

The modified setting or a new setting performed using the M driving dynamic control switch can also 
be assigned permanently to one of the two M buttons on the steering wheel. The corresponding M 
button on the steering wheel must be held down for a longer period until confirmed by an acoustic 
signal. The current configuration is assumed and overwrites the previously saved setting. This enables 
a quick adaptation or saving without calling up the M configuration menu. 

A 

If the driver is not aware that holding down an M button overwrites the current configuration/setting, 
this may lead to an unjustified customer complaint. 


Live adjustment 

During the journey, the desired ideal tuning of the individual driving dynamics systems is determined 
using the drive dynamic control switches and then, before "Residing OFF", one of the two M buttons 
on the steering wheel is pressed for a long period until the acoustic signal is heard. 

6.2.2. M instrument cluster 

The M instrument cluster in the F97/F98 is based on the multifunction instrument display 
(12.3" TFT display) of the F90. 

The following M-specific changes exist in comparison with the G01/G02: 

• Speed and engine speed display correspond to the drive concept (330 km/h in 30 km 
classification, 8000 rpm) 

• Typical M red needles, dial illuminated in white (including in daylight without headlights 
switched on), X3 M/X4 M insignia. 


79 




F97/F98 Complete Vehicle 
6. General Vehicle Electronics 



F97, instrument cluster 


M-specific displays: 

• M Dynamic Mode (MDM) symbol in place of the DTC 

• Additional digital speed indicator 

• Display of all-wheel-drive mode 

• Ml = M Setup 1 

• M2 = M Setup 2 

• Display of gear 

• Display of Drivelogic (bar symbol such as a button) 

• Display of system status: Engine dynamics, damper control and M Servotronic 

• Shiftlight function inside the rev counter (only active when not activated on the HUD) 

• Temperature-dependent, variable engine-revolutions advance-warning field 

• Yellow indicator light to indicate standard drive. 

In the instrument cluster, the current configuration of the engine dynamics, damper control and 
Servotronic systems is shown in the upper area between the speed indicator and the engine speed 
display. This function can be activated under Settings in the Configuration menu display. 

The confirmation of the M configuration for M DSC, engine dynamics, transmission, EDC and M 
Servotronic is also issued centrally in the instrument cluster. 

For setting/adjustment work in the engine dynamics, EDC and M Servotronic systems the response of 
the button activation is also effected as a list in the instrument cluster. 

6.2.3. M Head-Up Display 

The multi-color head-up display available as option SA 610 can switch to the M-specific display. 

The following information/parameters can be shown:
