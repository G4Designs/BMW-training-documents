1. Introduction 


1.1. Initial information 

With the new BMW 745e xDrive, BMW is adding a further innovative model variant to The Ultimate 
Driving Machine. With its plug-in hybrid drive, the latest BMW 7 Series variant combines brand- 
typical driving dynamics with the option of driving electrically and emissions-free during shorter local 
journeys, while at the same time offering maximum efficiency over long distances. 

This reference material only covers the new BMW 745e xDrive in comparison with its predecessor, 
the BMW 740e iPerformance. Here, knowledge of the predecessor (G12 PHEV) and high-voltage 
technology of hybrid generation 3.0 is a requirement. 

Further information can be found in the listed documents:

Only Service employees who meet all the requirements are permitted to work on the designated high- 
voltage components: suitable qualifications, compliance with the safety rules, procedure following the 
exact repair instructions.

G12 LCI PHEV High-voltage Components 

1. Introduction 


A_ 

Work on live high-voltage components is expressly prohibited. Prior to every operation which involves 
a high-voltage component, it is essential to disconnect the high-voltage system from the voltage 
supply and to secure it against unauthorized return to service. 

1 Charging plug is not connected to the vehicle. 

2 Enter the PARK vehicle condition (e.g. by holding down the volume control button). 

3 Wait until the vehicle enters "Sleep" mode (identifiable by the fact that the inscription in the 
START/STOP button is not illuminated). 

4 Open high-voltage service disconnect. 

5 Secure the high-voltage service disconnect to prevent the high-voltage system against restarting. 

6 Activate PAD mode (e.g. by operating the start/stop button three times within 0.8 s). 

7 Wait until the Check Control message "High-voltage system switched-off" is displayed in the 
instrument cluster. 

8 Enter PARK vehicle condition. 


1.2. Positioning 

The BMW 745e xDrive, whose development code is G12 LCI PHEV, is based on the G12 LCI. It is 
the first vehicle of the new hybrid generation 4.0, laying the foundation stone for a series of plug-in 
hybrid electric vehicles which above all have greater ranges than their predecessor models. 

The model designation "Performance" and the associated exterior identifying features are no longer 
used for vehicles of hybrid generation 4.0. 

Technically, hybrid generation 4.0 is mostly based on the drive technology used in the BMW 
iPerformance models (hybrid generation 3.0). The G12 LCI PHEV is a full hybrid vehicle with a lithium- 
ion high-voltage battery, which can be charged, for example, using a household socket. 

The abbreviation PHEV in the development code stands for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle.

The higher model designation in comparison with the predecessor model is already an indication 
of this. The drive of the G12 LCI PHEV consists of a 6-cylinder engine with TwinPower exhaust 
turbocharger technology, an 8-speed automatic transmission and an electrical machine. The main 
advantage of the drive system deployed in the G12 LCI PHEV is the enhanced drive power compared 
to the predecessor model (293 kW (398 hp) combined system power). 

The electric drive of the G12 LCI PHEV enables all-electric driving and thus emissions-free driving at 
speeds up to 87 mph. The maximum electric range is approx. 24 miles with xDrive. 

The driving and drive system modes have been merged and simplified. With the newly assigned 
Driving Experience Control in the G12 LCI PHEV, the driving modes ADAPTIVE, SPORT, HYBRID 
and ELECTRIC can be selected. Each of the last two driving modes can be individualized with regard 
to efficiency or dynamics. The drive system modes are no longer used in the familiar form. With the 
ELECTRIC drive system mode, the G12 LCI PHEV runs with all-electric driving at up to 87 mph.

The most extensive changes / new features in the vehicle compared to hybrid generation 3.0 are: 

• 6-cylinder engine replaces the 4-cylinder engine 

• Increase in the cell capacity in the high-voltage battery 

• Variant of the drive system modes. 

Many high-voltage components and hybrid-specific adaptations have been adopted for the 
G12 LCI PHEV unchanged from hybrid generation 3.0 (excluding minor changes to software or 
adaptations to the 6-cylinder engine): 

• Electrical machine 

• Automatic transmission GA8P75HZ 

• Electrical Machine Electronics (EME) 

• Convenience charging electronics (KLE) 

• Electric A/C compressor (EKK) 

• Electrical heating (EH) 

• Fuel supply with pressurized fuel tank below the luggage compartment

Some of the changes are discussed in more detail in the following subchapters. 


2.1.1. Belt drive 

For deployment in the G12 LCI PHEV, the belt drive has been modified compared to the B58TU 
engine in a conventional vehicle. The elimination of the alternator and mechanical air conditioning 
compressor enabled a reduction in the width of the belt from 6 ribs to 3 ribs. 

The vibration damper has also been adapted to the modified belt drive. A viscous vibration damper 
with rigid belt pulley is used.

A belt that is not tensioned in line with accepted technical principles can lead to loss of function of the 
driven component or to damage. The notes and instructions in the current repair instructions therefore 
apply.

2.3. Electrical machine 

The electrical machine is a component that has been adopted from vehicles of hybrid generation 3.0. 
However, the permanently energized synchronous machine is activated with higher currents by the 
Electrical Machine Electronics (EME), increasing the maximum torque from 250 Nm to 265 Nm. 

The torque increase meant that a new type approval test was carried out and the last letter in the 
designation of the electrical machine was changed as follows: GC1P25M. 

The electrical machine is a high-voltage component!

With the introduction of the more powerful B58TU engine in the hybrid drive, the driving dynamics 
systems were also optimized and given a more sporty configuration. The following graphic provides an 
overview of the changes to the standard suspension in comparison with the standard suspension of 
the G12 PHEV.

3. Chassis and Suspension 

In contrast to the predecessor model, the new DSCi brake system is deployed. A comparison of 
the previous system structure of the DSCi brake system reveals a clear reduction in the number of 
components required. The regenerative braking within the DSC brake system, which was previously 
implemented, is easily performed with the DSCi brake system. This means it does not need any extra 
DSCi variant for a hybrid vehicle.

3.2.3. Regenerative braking 

The regenerative braking enables brake energy regeneration. The electrical machine works here 
as an alternator and brakes the sprockets via automatic transmission - propeller shaft - rear axle 
differential - output shafts. Using the energy generated here, the high-voltage battery is charged via 
the electrical machine electronics (EME). 

Energy recovery takes place as soon as the accelerator is not operated. Depending on the driving 
mode selected, the deceleration which occurs during the coasting energy recovery is different. 

When the driver presses the brake pedal, the brake request is sensed via a brake pedal travel sensor 
integrated in the DSCi unit. Two driver separator valves prevent the hydraulic pressure generated from 
being able to act in the direction of the wheel brake. Instead, the hydraulic pressure passes through the 
opened simulator valve to the brake pedal force simulator. An elastomer inside the brake pedal force 
simulator generates the customary counter-force. 

The sensor signal of the brake pedal travel sensor is processed by the DSCi control unit and the 
"recuperation torque" is forwarded to the Electrical Machine Electronics (EME). In response, the EME 
activates the electrical machine as an alternator and the vehicle is decelerated by the energy recovery. 

The maximum permissible brake force by brake energy recovery is subject to stability monitoring of 
slip, lateral accelerations and stability control processes. It is thus ensured that the vehicle constantly 
remains in a stable driving condition, also during brake energy regeneration. 


23 









G12 LCI PHEV High-voltage Components 

3. Chassis and Suspension 

The energy recovery level is reduced or is not permitted in the following operating conditions: 

1 On detection of adversely affected driving stability, the energy recovery level is reduced. 

2 If emergency braking is detected, the deceleration request is implemented purely hydraulically 
in order to ensure fast implementation of the hydraulic interventions at the individual wheels as 
required. 

3 If no energy recovery is available (for example fully charged high-voltage battery or temperature 
limits exceeded), the deceleration is implemented purely hydraulically. 

4 At driving speeds below approx. 10 mph. 


3.2.4. Hydraulic braking 

If the brake request exceeds the deceleration possible as a result of energy recovery, the linear 
actuator is activated. The electro-hydraulic brake pressure generated in this way is routed through the 
opened linear actuator changeover valves in the direction of the wheel brakes. The vehicle decelerates 
in this situation both hydraulically and via the electrical machine.

4.1. Overview 

With the G12 LCI PHEV, high-voltage battery generation 4.0 is deployed for the first time. The basic 
layout of the lithium-ion battery is the same as that for the high-voltage battery of the G12 PHEV and 
the G30 PHEV. The most significant change from the predecessor model is that the cell capacity has 
been increased from 26 Ah to 34 Ah.

6. Displays and Operation 

6.1. Driving modes 


6.1.1. Overview 


The driving and drive system modes have been merged and can be activated using the new Driving 
Experience Control. The separate eDrive button which can be used to shift through the drive system 
modes is no longer used. Its place is taken by the Battery Control button. 



G12 LCI PHEV Overview of driving modes 


The HYBRID driving mode is divided into 3 specified variants and/or attributes. It is possible to shift 
through these variants by repeatedly pressing the corresponding button on the Driving Experience 
Control. Alongside the standard variant, the SPORT and ELECTRIC driving modes have an individual 
variant which the driver can also shift through by repeatedly pressing the Driving Experience Control. 
In addition, these two driving modes can be configured using the controller. 


The familiar ECO PRO functions can be activated in the HYBRID ECO PRO and 
ELECTRIC INDIVIDUAL driving modes. 


A shift of the gear selector switch to the manual position is possible in almost any driving mode. It is 
only in the case of the ELECTRIC driving mode that manual shifting (also via the shift paddles on the 
steering wheel) leads to a switch into the HYBRID driving mode with its last selected variant. 


6.1.2. HYBRID 

In the HYBRID driving mode, the vehicle chooses the optimum drive combination depending on the 
state of charge of the high-voltage battery and accelerator pedal position. If the driver's power request 
exceeds the maximum available electrical power, the combustion engine is activated automatically and 
comfortably.

G12 LCI PHEV Attributes of HYBRID driving mode 


The HYBRID driving mode is available with 3 attributes: 

• STANDARD 

• ECO PRO 

• COMFORT. 

STANDARD 

The attribute of the HYBRID STANDARD driving mode corresponds to the combination of COMFORT 
and Auto eDrive mode from the predecessor model. HYBRID STANDARD is always active after a new 
vehicle start. 

Exception: 

• The gear selector switch is in the Manual / Sport program position. 

• The ELECTRIC INDIVIDUAL driving mode has been selected as the standard driving mode 
and is available. 

The HYBRID STANDARD mode can in principle be divided into 2 parts: The charge depleting phase 
and the charge sustaining phase. 

In the charge depleting phase, the G12 LCI PHEV can be driven electrically at up to approx. 68 mph. 
The combustion engine is activated at speeds above 68 mph or for high power requirements. The 
combustion engine is switched off if the speed falls below 65 mph into the electric driving range. 

In the charge sustaining phase, accelerations up to approx. 25 mph and constant-speed driving up 
to approx. 37 mph are possible as all-electric driving. During operation at low speeds, driving states 
in which the combustion engine is off alternate with driving states in which the combustion engine is 
running. 

Outside this efficiency-optimized eDrive range, the combustion engine is automatically started in case 
of high load and speed demands. 

In general, the following applies to the electric drive: If the vehicle is driven after a long immobilization 
period at very cold ambient temperatures, this may result in a power reduction of the electrical drive or 
it may not be available at all. The reason for this may be an excessively low cell temperature in the cell 
modules of the high-voltage battery. 

ECO PRO 

The HYBRID ECO PRO driving mode rigorously supports a driving style that reduces consumption 
and its attribute corresponds to the combination of ECO PRO and Auto eDrive of the predecessor 
model. In this driving mode, the G12 LCI PHEV offers its maximum range. Essentially the following 
measures help to increase the range: 


34 






G12 LCI PHEV High-voltage Components 

6. Displays and Operation 

• A modified accelerator pedal characteristic curve and shift program with automatic 
transmission helps the driver adopt a driving style that optimizes fuel consumption 

• No boost function available (except with kickdown) 

• Coasting 

• The combustion engine is switched off in the case of coasting at up to 100 mph 

• Power reduction of the electrical comfort consumer units such as mirror, 
seat or rear window heating 

• Power reduction of heating / air-conditioning system. 

Individualization in the same way as in the predecessor model is no longer possible in the 
HYBRID ECO PRO mode. The attribute corresponds to specified parameters. 

COMFORT 

The attribute of the HYBRID COMFORT driving mode corresponds to the combination of COMFORT 
PLUS and Auto eDrive mode from the predecessor model. 

Here, the combustion engine and automatic transmission are shifted into a very comfortable attribute; 
the Electronic Damper Control (EDC) is shifted into a soft attribute. In this way, a vehicle setting 
configured for comfort is assumed, ensuring optimal travel comfort. 


6.1.3. ELECTRIC 

The attribute of the ELECTRIC driving mode corresponds to the combination of COMFORT 
and MAX eDrive mode of the predecessor model. In contrast to the HYBRID driving mode, in 
ELECTRIC INDIVIDUAL the driver has the possibility to adjust settings with regard to efficiency 
and driving dynamics. 



G12 LCI PHEV Attributes of ELECTRIC driving mode 

The ELECTRIC driving mode is available with 2 attributes: 

• STANDARD 

• INDIVIDUAL 

STANDARD 

With a sufficient charge state of the high-voltage battery, all-electric driving of the vehicle with 
maximum output of the electric drive is possible for up to 24 miles . In this case, the maximum speed 
of 87 mph is the same as in the predecessor model. 

In the STANDARD variant, all ECO PRO settings are switched off and the damping and steering are set 
to "Comfort" (see ELECTRIC INDIVIDUAL). 


35 








G12 LCI PHEV High-voltage Components 

6. Displays and Operation 

The following events can mean that the ELECTRIC driving mode cannot be selected or is disabled: 

• High-voltage battery state of charge too low 

• Kickdown (switch to HYBRID STANDARD) 

• Speed too high 

• Gear selector switch in Manual / Sport program (change to HYBRID with the last selected 
variant) 

• Shift paddles on the steering wheel actuated (change to HYBRID with the last selected variant) 

• Cell temperature too high / low 

• System fault. 

INDIVIDUAL 

In the new G12 LCI PHEV, the driver has the possibility to individualize the ELECTRIC driving mode 
and make settings with regard to efficiency and sporting character. ELECTRIC INDIVIDUAL can 
be selected as the standard driving mode so that this driving mode is active at every engine start. 
Alongside all other settings, this is saved for the driver profile currently in use. 

There is no longer a display of the ECO PRO potential. 


6.1.4. SPORT 

In the SPORT driving mode, a sporty engine and suspension setting provides an assured and dynamic 
driving experience.

G12LCI PHEV Attributes of SPORT driving mode 

The SPORT driving mode is available with 2 attributes: 

• STANDARD 

• INDIVIDUAL 


STANDARD 

In the SPORT STANDARD driving mode, the combustion engine is always running or running in 
addition while the vehicle is being driven as soon as the driving mode is activated. 

Essentially the following measures contribute to increasing the output and dynamics: 

• Alteration of the attributes of the accelerator pedal characteristic curve and the shift program 
in automatic transmissions for a sporty driving style 

• More sporty setting of the driving dynamics systems (damping and steering) 

• Higher boost output available

6. Displays and Operation 


Combustion engine is not switched off while the vehicle is being driven (only at a standstill) 

No coasting available 

Greater increase in the load point of the combustion engine to ensure sufficiently high battery 
charge for provision of the boost function. 


INDIVIDUAL 

In exactly the same way as in ELECTRIC, the SPORT driving mode can be individualized. Here, setting 
options from the predecessor model are used. 


6.1.5. ADAPTIVE 

With the ADAPTIVE driving mode, the entire engine and vehicle setting automatically adapts to both 
the driving situation and the driving style. 

6.1.6. Service note 

The combustion engine can be started with the vehicle at a standstill, for example for an emission 
inspection. To achieve this, with activated driving readiness, the brake and accelerator must be 
pressed while drive position P or N is engaged. 


6.2. BATTERY CONTROL 

The BATTERY CONTROL mode is selected using the separate Battery Control button. Another 
new feature is the charge target value. This can now be set to a charge state of 30-100% (previously 
30-80%).
