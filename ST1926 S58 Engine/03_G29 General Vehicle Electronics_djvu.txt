4.4. Lighting 

There are 2 different equipment specifications available for the lighting: 

• LED headlights (standard equipment) 

• Adaptive Full LED lights (SA 552) 

The LED modules are activated via the two control units Frontal Light Electronics Left (FLEL) and 
Frontal Light Electronics Right (FLER). 

The G29 does not have a headlight cleaning system. This is not required by law for these LED 
headlights.

4.4.1. Headlight 

The headlights only have one projection module per side. The low-beam headlight and the high beam 
are produced via this projection module. The projection modules can only be swivelled vertically.

Static adaptive headlight with cornering light 


For the function of the static Adaptive Headlight the LED of the cornering light is switched on for the 
low-beam headlight in order to better illuminate the inside area of the bend. The prerequisites are: 


• Bend detected (steering angle and yaw rate) 

• Speed up to 70 km/h (45 mph) 

Cornering light 

For a cornering manoeuvre the LED for the cornering light is switched on at the respective side in 
order to better illuminate the area at the side. The prerequisites for activating the cornering light are: 

• Cornering detected (steering angle or turn indicator) 

• Speed up to 40 km/h (25 mph)

4.4.3. Lighting functions 

With the introduction of the new light switch (buttons) in the 2018 service pack and as a result of 
statutory provisions, the operating logic of the lighting functions is changing. The following table 
should illustrate the logic in the different driving conditions:

4.5. Heating and air conditioning system 

The following climate control system is installed: 

• 2/1 -zone Automatic air conditioning 

From a technical perspective the climate control is divided into zones (e.g. driver, front passenger). 
The first digit represents the individually adjustable temperature settings, whilst the second digit 
represents the zones in which the amount of air can be individually adjusted. 

4.5.1. Control panel

4.5.2. Overview of refrigerant circuit 

A compact coolant-cooled condenser is installed. The line from the evaporator to the air conditioning 
compressor and from the air conditioning condenser to the evaporator is double-walled. The 
refrigerant for the evaporator is already pre-cooled.

5. Driver Assistance Systems 

The G29 receives assistance systems and sensors introduced with the 2018 service pack. This 
product information shows only an overview of the available assistance systems and sensors. Further 
information on the assistance systems is provided in the product information 

ST1858 Driver Assistance Systems 2018. 


5.1. Overview 

The purpose of the following tables is to provide an overview of the dependencies between the offer 
structure and assistance systems used as well as their system components. Furthermore, they also list 
all assistance systems available in the G29. 

5.1.1. Offer structure "Driving" 

Standard equipment 

Active Guard (SA 5AV) and Dynamic Cruse Control (SA 544) are standard in the G29. All G29 vehicles 
are always equipped with the KAFAS-Mid-Camera. 

Optional equipment 

In the G29 the customer has a choice of optional equipment for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems 
(ADAS). 

Below you can see the standard and options that are available: 


Active Guard (5AV standard) 


- Lane Departure Warning 

- Front Collision Mitigation 

- Daytime Pedestrian Protection 

- Speed Limit Info 

- Speed Limiter

Active cruise control with Stop&Go 
function (OE 5DF optional) 


- Active cruise 
control with 
Stop&Go 
(up to 160 km/h 
(100 mph)) 




Driving Assistance Package (ZDA) 


Includes all features of the Active Driving 
Assistant (OE 5AS) and the following: 

- Blind Spot Detection 

- Lane Departure Warning 



KAFAS 



Dynamic Cruise Control (standard) 

- Cruise Control with braking function 

- Speed Limiter 


28 


























G29 General Vehicle Electronics 

5. Driver Assistance Systems 

5.1.2. Offer structure "Parking" 

The familiar optional equipment Park Distance Control (PDC) (SA 508) and Parking Assistant (SA 
5DM) are also offered in the G29. 

Vehicles not equipped with the Parking Manoeuvre Assistant (PMA) but with the Park Distance Control 
(PDC) have a separate control unit, which is recognized as the PMA control unit by the diagnosis and 
is also referred to by this name in the bus diagram. In other words, there is no longer a difference in 
the naming of the PDC and PMA control unit (there are however differences in the hardware design 
between the control units and the software is adapted to the equipment specification). 


Parking Assistant (SA 5DM) is included in M Sport Package (ZMP) and Convenience 
Package (ZCV) 


• Automatic Parking with parallel parking 
and manoeuvring out of parking spaces 

• Back-up Assistant 

• Auto PDC 

• Front and rear Park Distance Control 
(PDC) 

• Side protection 

• Rear view camera 





As can be seen in the overview, the G29 does not have the optional equipment system SAS control 
unit. Therefore, the PMA and DSC control units assume the longitudinal and lateral guidance of the 
Parking Manoeuvring Assistant PMA.

The fault-free function of the FRS is very much dependent on the exact setting. With the adjustment 
option the FRS can be adjusted during start-up using special tools. The start-up of the FRS must be 
carried out in the following situations: 


In the case of a fault memory entry 

After the removal and installation of the front radar sensor 

After the installation of a new front radar sensor 


32 












G29 General Vehicle Electronics 

5. Driver Assistance Systems 

A 

In the case of an incorrectly set front radar sensor FRS it can happen that objects and vehicles are 
not properly detected or not detected at all. The functions of the related assistance systems may be 
restricted or fail. Therefore, the instructions and conditions for a start-up from the current version of 
the repair instructions must be observed.
