Omitted control units: 

• The Light Effect Manager (LEM) is omitted. Actuation of the LEDs of the panorama roof is 
performed by the Body Domain Controller (BDC). Actuation of the LEDs of the speakers in the 
HIGH-End audio system is performed by the Receiver Audio Module (RAM). 

• Active Sound Design is omitted. Active Sound Design has been integrated in the Receiver 
Audio Module (RAM). If necessary, the booster is still required for the outside sound. 

• The high-beam assistant (FLA) is omitted from all European versions. The function is 
performed by the camera-based driver assistance systems (KAFAS). 


3.2. Ethernet 

The established 2-wire OABR Ethernet (OPEN Alliance BroadR-Reach) is used in all vehicles. The 
Ethernet variant with 5 lines (4 data lines and 1 activation line) is still used by the OBD2 interface to the 
Body Domain Controller (BDC). 

The standard "Open Alliance BroadR-Reach" (OABR Ethernet) has been specially developed as a 
new data transmission layer for use in vehicles. OABR Ethernet only requires an unshielded twisted 
two-wire connection. If the Ethernet line is situated in the area of antennas in the vehicle, this is if 
necessary shielded in order to avoid interference. OABR Ethernet supports bidirectional 100 MBit/s 
communication between 2 nodes. This means that both nodes can simultaneously send and receive at 
a data transfer rate of 100 MBit/s. OABR Ethernet requires point-to-point networking. This means that 
the bus system is not split up between multiple nodes, as is the case e.g. with CAN (Controller Area 
Network) systems. Instead, Ethernet switches are used for the connection of further nodes. 

Ethernet switches are integrated in the following control units: 

• Body Domain Controller (BDC) 

• Optional equipment system (SAS) 

• Head Unit High 3 (HU-H3). 

The top rear side view camera (TRSVC) is the master and the Ethernet switch for the: 

• Front camera 

• Exterior mirror camera, left 

• Exterior mirror camera, right 

• Rear view camera 

The instrument cluster (KOMBI) is connected to the Driver Camera System (DCS) by Ethernet. 

The Receiver Audio Module (RAM) is the master for the booster. 

The booster is not shown by the ISTA diagnosis system in the bus overview.

General Vehicle Electronics 2018 

3. Bus systems 

In vehicles with the Head Unit High 3 (HU-H3) the following control units are connected directly to the 
head unit: 

• Telematic Communication Box (TCB) 

• Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE) 

• Driver Camera System (DCS) 

• and Receiver Audio Module (RAM) 

As a result, the Ethernet interfaces on the Body Domain Controller (BDC) are sufficient, and no 
additional Ethernet switch (ENS) is required. 

An Ethernet switch (ENS) is used in vehicles with the Head Unit Basic, depending on the vehicle 
equipment. In the event of failure of an Ethernet switch, all bus users connected by it are disconnected 
from the rest of the network and are no longer able to communicate via Ethernet. 

In the wiring diagram the connection of the top rear side view camera (TRSVC) control unit and 
rear view camera (RFK) is shown. In the vehicle, either TRSVC is installed for a vehicle with multiple 
cameras, or RFK for a vehicle with a rear view camera (standalone). 

The wiring diagram shows the Ethernet on the example of the G05.

General Vehicle Electronics 2018 

5. Dual Storage System 


The dual storage system serves to support the vehicle electrical system. A 12 V lithium ion battery and 
a 12 V lead-acid battery are installed for this purpose. The dual storage system serves to power the 
vehicle electrical power system in a safe and reliable way. 

The two batteries are connected in parallel and are isolated only in the event of a fault by the battery 
isolating switch installed in the lithium ion battery. 

The dual storage system is installed: 

• so that the emissions threshold values are adhered to 

• if necessary instead of the familiar vehicle electrical system support with a 
50 Ah or 60 Ah lead-acid battery and Power Control Unit (PCU). 

Depending on: 

• the engine version 

• the optional equipment 

the dual storage system is installed. 

Exception: 

The vehicle electrical system support with a 50 Ah or 60 Ah lead- acid battery and Power Control Unit 
(PCU) is installed in vehicles with electric active roll stabilization. 

Benefits from the dual storage system: 

• Reduced C02 

• Weight saving with regard to vehicle electrical system support with AGM battery 

• Emergency starting function 

The lithium ion battery can be charged or discharged with higher currents than a lead-acid battery. 

In this way, more energy can be stored for example in coasting overrun mode and exported where 
necessary. This results in a reduction in C02 emissions. 

If the dual storage system is installed instead of the vehicle electrical system support with lead-acid 
battery, a weight saving of 17 kg (37 lbs) or 19 kg (42 lbs) is made, depending on the capacity of the 
lead-acid battery. 

If the starter battery is so flat that the engine cannot be started, the engine can if necessary be started 
via the lithium ion battery. 

C02 potential through energy recovery (1-2 g/km) 

The dual storage system improves the energy recover capability of the 12V system. The energy 
recovery power output increases from approx. 0.5 kW to approx. 2 kW. This enables a large part of the 
base load in the vehicle to be compensated. In this way, the drivetrain is only subjected to minimal load 
by the alternator during acceleration phases. 

MSA start quality 

The lithium ion battery increases the power output at the starter motor. Improved engine starting 
reduces the engine vibrations.

General Vehicle Electronics 2018 

5. Dual Storage System 

Protection of the lead-acid battery 

Thanks to the dual storage system the cyclisation of the lead-acid battery is dramatically reduced and 
taken on by the lithium ion battery. This significantly prolongs the service life of the lead-acid battery.

If the permissible values for: 


• Voltage 

• Current 

• Temperature 

• State of charge 

are exceeded or undershot, the battery isolating switch opens to prevent damage to the lithium ion 
battery. 

The battery isolating switch is automatically closed when the permissible values are reached. 

The battery isolating switch is opened when the safety battery terminal of the vehicle battery is 
triggered. The battery isolating switch is closed only after repair has been completed and with terminal

6. ID Transmitter 


The ID transmitter is equipped with a motion sensor. 

The ID transmitter is already incorporated in current G series as of March 2018 and is not a Service 
Pack 2018 measure. All G series with Comfort Access receive this ID transmitter.

ID transmitter sleeping (no motion detected) 

B 

ID transmitter awake (motion detected) 


6.1.1. ID transmitter sleeping 

If no motion is detected by the ID transmitter because it is lying for example on a table, it goes to 
sleep after 2 minutes. Hence, no communication is possible from the vehicle to the ID transmitter. The 
vehicle cannot be unlocked or started with a wireless range extender whereby the wireless path from 
and to the vehicle is increased. This measure thus effectively prevents vehicle theft using this method. 

6.1.2. ID transmitter awake 

The ID transmitter is woken by: 

• detection of motion 

• or operation of a button. 

This re-establishes communication with the vehicle.

6.2. ID transmitter in the vehicle 



ID transmitter in the vehicle 

If the ID transmitter is in the vehicle, it must remain awake so that communication with the vehicle 
is possible. Communication with the ID transmitter occurs when the start/stop button is operated. 
Engine starting would not be possible if the ID transmitter were sleeping. 

If the ID transmitter is in the vehicle, communication occurs every 45 minutes: 

• from the vehicle to the ID transmitter 

• and from the ID transmitter to the vehicle. 

This prevents the ID transmitter from going to sleep. 

If an ID transmitter is in the vehicle, it goes to sleep when the vehicle is locked or doublelocked with 
different ID transmitter.

Comfort Access antennas in the side sill 

When the vehicle is exited, the Comfort Access antennas in the left and right side sills are activated by 
the Body Domain Controller (BDC). 

Both antennas are also activated when selective unlocking is set. Selective unlocking is a key function 
and accordingly only active on the corresponding ID transmitter. This makes it possible to unlock the 
vehicle from the passenger's side with a different ID transmitter on which selective unlocking is not 
active.

General Vehicle Electronics 2018 

7. Comfort Access 2.0 


The Comfort Access antennas in the left and right side sills transmit every 0.4 s at a frequency of 
125 kHz. If there is no ID transmitter in the transmission range of the antennas, these are activated 
with 400 mA per antenna. 

If an ID transmitter is in the transmission range of the antennas, activation per antenna is reduced to 
50 mA, depending on the distance between the ID transmitter and the vehicle. To prevent the vehicle 
battery from being excessively discharged, the Comfort Access antennas are deactivated after the 
vehicle has stood idle for 2 days. A driving cycle must happen in order to reactivate this function. In this 
way, the automatic functions are inactive without actuation by the customer. Comfort Access functions 
with deactivated antennas as in the 1st generation. 

ID transmitter 

When an ID transmitter receives a signal from a Comfort Access antenna in the side sill, it transmits 
a message to the remote control receiver (FBD). The ID transmitter transmits, depending on the field 
strength of the signal received, a corresponding message to the remote control receiver. This message 
is evaluated and consequently the distance is determined by the Body Domain Controller (BDC). The 
different actions can therefore be activated, depending on the distance between the ID transmitter and 
the vehicle.

9.1.1. ID transmitter 

The ID transmitter can be positioned with centimeter precision. The Comfort Access antennas are 
activated by the Body Domain Controller (BDC). Communication from the Comfort Access antennas to 
the ID transmitter is performed at 125 kHz. Depending on its position, the ID transmitter receives the 
data of: 


• the antennas in the side sills 

• the antennas in the vehicle interior 

• the antennas in the luggage compartment 

The ID transmitter transmits, depending on the data received and their field strength, a corresponding 
message to the remote control receiver. Communication from the ID transmitter to the remote control 
receiver is performed at 434 MHz (frequency dependent on the national-market version). The data 
received by the remote control receiver (FBD) are evaluated by the Body Domain Controller. This 
makes it possible to pinpoint precisely the position of the ID transmitter. 

Security against manipulation is ensured by secure hardware. 


9.1.2. NFC 

Precise positioning is automatically achieved by the short range of NFC. 

Security is ensured by a Secure Element in the mobile phone. 

9.1.3. Bluetooth 

The long range of Bluetooth can give rise to strong reflections and to damping. This makes precise 
positioning impossible. 

Security is not guaranteed due to software-manipulation of the operating system.
