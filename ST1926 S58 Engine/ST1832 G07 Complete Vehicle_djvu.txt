G07 Complete Vehicle 

1. Introduction 


The new G07 has a distinctive and confident presence. It sets new standards in elegance and luxury 
and is satisfyingly generously appointed. Based on the concept of the G05, the G07 is a larger design 
and, with 3 rows of seats as standard, offers comfortable seating space for six or seven people. 

Since the G05 forms the basis for the G07, this product information module only describes the 
particular features specific to the BMW X7. Details of all the shared features can be found in the 
product information modules for the G05.

2.1. Exterior equipment 

2.1.1. Exterior design 

Even though the G07 is based on the G05, the exterior design of the BMW X7 is individually styled. As 
a result, the two vehicles are easily distinguishable from one another by their visual appearance. The 
particular features of the exterior trim include the larger symmetrically split and rounded radiator grill, 
the distinctively styled headlights and the full-width trim strip and vehicle-specific rear light cluster.

2.2.4. 2nd-row seats 

As the G07 always has 3 rows of seats, the adjustment of the 2nd row of seats is fully electric as 
standard. 

Comfort seats in the rear 

As standard, the G07 has comfort seats in the rear. As on the G05, the G07 offers the usual 40:20:40 
folding backrests. The two outer backrests are electrically operated, whereas the center backrest is 
folded manually and is locked to the left-hand backrest. In addition, 145 mm of fore/aft adjustment of 
the individual seats powered by two electric motors provides extra comfort or more load space in the 
luggage compartment. Those functions are controlled separately left and right by two control units. 

If seats are replaced in a vehicle, they must be retaught with the ISTA diagnosis system. 

The seat belts on the 2nd row of seats are vertically adjustable as standard.

2.3. Heating and air-conditioning systems 

Two versions of the integrated automatic heating/air conditioning system (IHKA) are available for the 
G07. The IHKA regulated on the air side is based in part on the G12 and G01. More in-depth topics 
can be found in the product information ST1501 G12 Climate Control. 

• 4/3-zone IHKA (standard equipment) 

• 5/4-zone integrated heating and air conditioning system (option SA 4NN). 

From a technical perspective the climate control is divided into zones (e.g. driver, front passenger, 
rear passenger compartment, temperature...). The 1st digit represents the number of individually 
adjustable temperature zones, while the 2nd digit represents the number of zones in which the air 
volume is separately controllable. On the G05 and G07 the heating/air conditioning display is fitted 
between the center air vents for the first time.

2.3.1.4/3-zone IHKA 

A 4/3-zone IHKA is already installed as basic equipment in the G07. Four different temperature zones 
can be set by the driver, front passenger and in the rear passenger compartment. The air volume and 
temperature in the 1 st row of seats can be regulated by the driver and front passenger. 

For the rear seats, there is a 2nd air conditioning control panel. It enables control of two temperature 
zones and the shared air volume and air distribution in the rear passenger compartment.

2.3.2. 5/4-zone IHKA 

If fitted with equipment option SA 4NN, the G07 has a 5/4-zone integrated heating and air conditioning 
system. With this automatic heating/air conditioning system, an additional air conditioning control 
panel for the 3rd row of seats is fitted in the roof. That means that a separate temperature zone and 
common air volume can be set for the 3rd row of seats. In addition, individual air distribution and an 
automatic programme are also possible. With the 5/4-zone integrated heating and air conditioning 
system for the 3rd row of seats, there are additional air vents in the footwell area and in the roof.

2.4. Luggage compartment 

2.4.1. Luggage compartment volume 

The luggage compartment capacity of the new BMW X7 varies according to the position of the 3rd row 
of seats. If the 3rd-row seats are folded down, the luggage compartment capacity is 750 liters. If the 
3rd-row seats are in the upright position, the luggage compartment capacity is reduced to 300 liters. 
The luggage compartment roller cover can be stowed in a separate compartment under the luggage 
compartment floor. Due to the length of the luggage compartment roller cover, stowage or removal of 
the roller cover requires the side covers in the luggage compartment to be removed.

2.4.2. Switch panels 

On the left-hand side of the luggage compartment there is a switch cluster for controlling the 
backrests of the 2nd and 3rd seat rows. It enables the backrests to be electrically operated from the 
luggage compartment. 

As well as the buttons for folding the individual backrests, there are two other buttons. The button for 
maximum passenger convenience raises all the 2nd and 3rd seat row backrests. At the same time, the 
2nd row of seats is moved forwards to make enough space for the 3rd row of seats. 

The cargo adjuster button folds down the backrests of the 2nd and 3rd seat rows. At the same time, 
the 2nd row of seats moves backwards to close the gap between the luggage compartment floor and 
the 2nd row of seats. That creates a continuous load-space floor. 

In the lower tailgate switch panel there is a button for lowering the vehicle. When that button is 
pressed, the height of the vehicle is lowered by 40 mm to make loading and unloading the luggage 
compartment easier.

3. Chassis and Suspension 

3.1. Air suspension 

The G07 already has front and rear air suspension as standard. As a result, even the basic version of 
the BMW X7 has four-wheel ride-height adjustment, which on the G05 is offered as an option. The 
highlight of the four-wheel ride height adjustment is the design of the sealed system in which the air 
pressure is not constantly equalized between the external atmosphere and the control system but 
internally within the control system between the pressure accumulator and the air suspension struts. 

The table below provides an overview of the components of the four-wheel ride-height adjustment 
system:

4.2.1. Telematic Communication Box (TCB) 

The G07 is fitted with the TCB 3. Compared with the TCB 2, the casing dimensions have been 
reduced. The unit is a modular design. The configuration can be adapted to suit the basic or optional 
equipment, which simultaneously reduces the number of variants. Equipment retrofits are also 
possible. 

4.2.2. Top Rear Side View Camera (TRSVC) 

The TRSVC control unit on the G07 is located in the luggage compartment behind the right-hand 
side trim panel. On the G05, the control unit was fitted at the front on the left in the instrument panel 
support. 


4.3. Headlight 

4.3.1. Overview 

The following exterior light versions are offered for the G07: 

• Adaptive Full LED Lights (standard) 

• Icon Adaptive LED Headlights with Laserlight (Option SA 5AZ). 

Like the G05, the G07 no longer features the customary rotary light switch. The new light switch panel 
only has buttons. 



The low-beam headlight is automatically switched on when the system recognizes that it is dark, even 
in the OFF mode and when driving readiness is activated (country-specific).

4.5. Driver Camera System 

The DCS driver camera system includes a camera on the instrument cluster to observe whether the 
driver's eyes are open and which direction the driver is facing. The DCS is connected to the electrical 
system via OABR Ethernet and has a separate wake-up line. 





Driver Camera System 


The DCS is able to detect the alertness and tiredness of the driver. The system also detects a change 
of driver. The following assistance systems use the data from the driver camera system: 

• Alertness assistant 

• Front collision mitigation 

Active cruse control with Stop&Go 

• Steering and traffic jam assistant 



The driver camera system processes all data in real time and does not have a memory for permanently 
storing the data recorded. 


More information on the driver camera system can be found in ST1858 Driver Assistance Systems 
2018. 


4.6. Rear Seat Entertainment system 

The control unit for the rear seat entertainment system is the Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE) control 
unit. The Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE) is always adapted to the installed head unit. 


4.6.1. Head Unit High 3 

The G07 uses the RSE rear seat entertainment system in conjunction with the Head Unit High 3 
(HU-H3).
