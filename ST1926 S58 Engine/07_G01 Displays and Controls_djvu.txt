in requirements for environmental protection, customer benefits and design render necessary 
continuous development of systems and components. Consequently, there may be discrepancies 
between the contents of this document and the vehicles available in the training course. 

This document basically relates to the European version of left-hand drive vehicles. Some operating 
elements or components are arranged differently in right-hand drive vehicles than shown in the 
graphics in this document. Further differences may arise as a result of the equipment specification in 
specific markets or countries.

Navigation System Professional (OE 609) CID 10.25" with touch operation 


4.2. Touch operation 

The G12 as well as the G30 with a Professional navigation system had, in conjunction with the CID 
touch operation, infrared LEDs integrated in the housing of the CID. Their task was to detect a hand 
moving toward the CID. If a hand was detected, the interface switches to a resolution that is optimized 
for touch operation. The new ID6 user interface is already optimized for touch operation. This is why 
infrared LEDs are no longer required. At a later time, the infrared LEDs will be completely omitted.
