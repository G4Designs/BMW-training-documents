guarantee the smooth operation of the system. 


Information status and national-market versions 

BMW Group vehicles meet the requirements of the highest safety and quality standards. Changes 
in requirements for environmental protection, customer benefits and design render necessary 
continuous development of systems and components. Consequently, there may be discrepancies 
between the contents of this document and the vehicles available in the training course. 

This document basically relates to the European version of left hand drive vehicles. Some operating 
elements or components are arranged differently in right-hand drive vehicles than shown in the 
graphics in this document. Further differences may arise as the result of the equipment specification in 
specific markets or countries.

RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LED modules are used for the ambient lighting. 

The lighting for the ambient interior lighting is controlled via a separate LIN bus. The individual LED 
modules are connected via a local interconnect network bus. The LED modules are connected in 
series to the LIN bus around the vehicle. 

If the LIN bus is interrupted at a certain point or the micro controller on the LED is faulty, then further 
light transmittance is interrupted at this point. A search for the fault must be carried out at the location 
where the last LED illuminates. 


2.2. Light Effect Manager 

On a vehicle with a Bowers & Wilkins audio system, the actuation of the lighting of the speaker trims is 
implemented via the Light Effect Manager.

The wiper motor is a 12 V motor with transmission. The control unit, wiper motor and the transmission 
form one complete unit. This wiper motor unit consists of: 

• A permanently excited direct current motor with attached reduction gear. 

• Control unit electronics with eccentric shaft sensor with attached plug connection. 

The control unit in the wiper motor is able to identify the following faults: 

• Faults in the control unit electronics. 

• Short circuits at the motor and sensor system. 

• Open lines at the motor and sensor system. 

The control unit in the wiper motor does not have a fault memory. The fault code entry is stored in the 
Body Domain Controller (BDC). 

The heated washer jets are activated by the Body Domain Controller. 

The Body Domain Controller is also responsible for actuation of the windshield washer pump and 
evaluation of the washer fluid level switch.

4.2.2. Function 

The function of the central locking system of the G30 is based on that of current BMW models. 

All functions relevant for the central locking system are controlled by the Body Domain Controller. 
The function is as follows: 

• The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the remote control receiver. 

• The signal causes the BDC to activate the central locking system and the interior lighting. 

• The BDC evaluates the status of all door contacts of the trunk and the hotel position switch. 

• The status of the central locking system button is also evaluated by the BDC. The BDC 

activates the central locking system, depending on the status. 

• The BDC is responsible for activation of the central locking system and the drive for 
automatic soft-close in the trunk. 

• Activation of fuel filler flap unlocking is also performed by the BDC.

The alarm system in the G30 is equipped with an ultrasonic interior movement detector for monitoring 
the passenger compartment. The ultrasonic interior movement detector (USIS) is fully integrated in 
the roof function center (FZD). 

The door contacts, engine compartment lid contact switch and the opening of the trunk are monitored 
by the Body Domain Controller. As soon as a status changes, the ultrasonic interior movement 
detector receives this information via the K-CAN2. If the alarm system is activated, the siren with tilt 


alarm sensor is activated by the control unit in the event of a break-in. 

The SINE is connected to the FZD via a local interconnect network bus. 

The status of the alarm system is displayed via the LED at the interior mirror.

Steering column switch cluster (SZL) 


The turn signal/high beam switch on the G30 mechanically engages in the corresponding position 
when operated. The return is done mechanically by the steering wheel upon returning to center. 


All signals of the buttons and switches of the multifunction steering wheel (MFL) and the steering 
column switch cluster (SZL) are transmitted via Local Interconnect Network (LIN) to the Body Domain 
Controller (BDC).

The instrument cluster receives the value of the ambient temperature from the outside temperature 
sensor and makes this available via the PT-CAN. The Body Domain Controller evaluates the signal and 
triggers the activation of the mirror heating via the local interconnect network bus. The control of the 
heater output is dependent on the ambient temperature. 

The mirror servomotors are activated by the mirror electronics. The request for adjusting the exterior 
mirror is received by the mirror electronics via the local interconnect network bus. 

The exterior mirrors still retain the folding in function, but now they can be programmed to 
automatically fold inward when the vehicle is locked. This feature must be activated in the CID by 
selecting My Vehicle. 


First select “My Vehicle” 



Next select “Vehicle settings”

13.3. Massage 

Eight different massage functions in the backrest and seat cushion are available to activate or relax 
muscles. This allows the back muscles to be relaxed and the strain on the spinal discs to be relieved. 
The 8 programs are divided into 3 categories: 

• Mobilization 

• Relaxation 

• Vitalization 

In the case of mobilization, the strain on the spine is relieved by targeted body movements. 

In the relaxation program, the muscles are relaxed by massage. 

The vitalization program is made up of both mobilization and relaxation. The combination of movement 
and massage ensures relaxation and recuperation, particularly on long drives.

Signal path of horn: 

• When the horn is pressed the signal is received by the steering column switch cluster (SZL). 

• The SZL sends the information via the LIN bus to the Body Domain Controller. 

• The Body Domain Controller evaluates the information and activates the relay for the horn.
