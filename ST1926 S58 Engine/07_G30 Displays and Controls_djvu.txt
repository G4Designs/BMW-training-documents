BMW Group vehicles meet the requirements of the highest safety and quality standards. Changes 
in requirements for environmental protection, customer benefits and design render necessary 
continuous development of systems and components. Consequently, there may be discrepancies 
between the contents of this document and the vehicles available in the training course. 

This document basically relates to the European version of left hand drive vehicles. Some operating 
elements or components are arranged differently in right-hand drive vehicles than shown in the 
graphics in this document. Further differences may arise as the result of the equipment specification in 
specific markets or countries.

1. Control Elements 

1.1. Introduction 

In the BMW 5 Series, interior design, functionality and comfort have reached an even higher level. The 
G30 is a pioneer in intuitive operation. The continually upgraded BMW iDrive system makes a range of 
fascinating new vehicle comfort and infotainment features available to both the driver and 
the passengers. 

1.1.1. New features in the G30 

The G30 is largely based on the G12 in regard to the displays and controls. 

The following table compares the new features and changes to the displays and controls 
in G30 with those in the G12:

1.2. Steering column switches 

In the G30, the turn signal/high beam switch and the wash/wipe switch immediately engage when 
operated. The one-touch signalling and headlight flasher continue to function as before. This measure 
was implemented in response to customer requests. The one-touch button will gradually disappear 
from BMW vehicles.

1.2.1. Wash/wipe switch 

The rain sensor mode is activated at the first detent position. An LED on the wash/wipe switch 
indicates that the rain sensor mode is activated. 

Following a terminal change, the rain sensor mode is automatically activated when the vehicle travels 
over 5 km/h / 3 mph. The LED on the wash/wipe switch indicates that the rain sensor mode has been 
reactivated. 

The rain sensor mode is already included in the standard equipment.

1.2.2. Service 

To avoid damage to the wiper blades when the windscreen is iced over, the rain sensor mode is not 
activated at temperatures of -5 °C / 23 °F or lower until the vehicle is travelling at a speed of more than 
7 km/h/4 mph.

2. Instrument Cluster 

2.1. Introduction 

There is only one instrument cluster available with the launch of the G30. The instrument cluster has 
an 8.8” TFT display and therefore allows for situation-dependent display of information that is relevant 
to the driver. This flexible display of information achieves a maximum degree of clarity and comfort and 
is used among other things for the following improvements: 

• Minimization of driver distraction by optimum arrangement of related functions and situation- 
based displays. 

• Improvement of the driving experience by the display hierarchy and design adapted to the 
driving situation. 

• Improved driving comfort through the display of new indicating instruments and functions 
(e.g. picture-in-picture map display on the instrument cluster).

2.4. Connection 

2.4.1. APIX connection 

A Head Unit 2 (HU H2) is installed in the G30, the instrument cluster is connected to the head unit 
via an APIX line. The APIX connection is needed to show the high-quality graphic displays in the 
instrument cluster (navigation instructions, etc.).

2.4.2. Overview 

The following graphic shows an overview of the instrument cluster connections:

2.5. Showroom mode 

The Showroom mode enables you to view the various instrument cluster displays and the Head-Up 
Display during a "virtual" journey. 

The Showroom mode is started via the test functions of the instrument cluster. 

The following steps must be followed: 

• Activate the PAD mode (press the start/stop button 3 times within 0.8 s) 

• Press and hold the setting button in the instrument cluster for 10 s 

• Activate the "Showroom mode" test function. 


2.5.1. Test functions 

There are further test functions in addition to the Showroom mode. An overview of the test functions 
of the G30 is provided in the following table:

2.6. Presentation mode 

The Presentation mode is used to operate the vehicle functions in showroom and trade show vehicles 
to demonstrate these to the customer. 

This mode enables the vehicle functions to be demonstrated to and operated by the customer without 
a vehicle-specific ID transmitter and without starting the engine. 

In addition, vehicle functions that could potentially cause damage in showrooms are deactivated. For 
example: Wash/wipe functions, power window or the electrical slide/tilt sunroof. If the ID transmitter is 
located in the vehicle interior, these functions will be operable. 


The Presentation mode is activated in the service menu via the BMW diagnosis system. Furthermore, 
this mode is only effective in the "Residing" driving condition.

The G30 contains a new user interface. It is referred to as the ID6 (BMW Drive of the 6th generation). 
Marketing refers to the user interface of the G30 as the "New Interface Design". 

The user interface of the G12 is referred to as the ID5. Although they have the same head unit (HU- 
H2), the vehicles have a different user interface. The breakdown of the individual menus is identical to 
the user interface of the G12.
