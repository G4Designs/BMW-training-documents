G05 Body 
1. Introduction 

1.1. Overview 

In November 2018 after 5 years the G05 will replace its predecessor the FI 5 with the 4th generation 
of the BMW X5. The G05 contains an abundance of new technologies and further developments. 

From a design perspective there is no longer a direct connection between the headlights and the 
BMW radiator grill. This design feature has already been introduced in the G01 (BMW X3). The larger 
wide BMW radiator grill, however, features more prominently in a more upright arrangement in the air 
stream. 

In terms of technology, the new BMW X5 is based on the G12. The topics listed below are described in 
the G12 product information brochures.

1. Introduction 

1.2. History of X5 

In autumn 1999 BMW presented the first generation of the BMW X5, the E53, at the North American 
International Auto Show and in doing so justified the segment of Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV). 

The second generation, the E70, followed at the end of 2006 and from November 2013 the third 
generation, the FI 5, will be available in dealerships. The appearance characteristic of BMW X models 
combines design features typical of the BMW brand with clear signals for presence, robustness and 
diversity. The resulting design was further developed for the new BMW X5 in a modern and distinctive 
way.

2.2. Vehicle underbody 

The almost fully closed vehicle underbody plays an important role in the aerodynamics and in reducing 

CO 2 emissions. The acoustics in the vehicle are also significantly improved as a result. The use of 
textile material improves the external acoustics and at the same time reduces weight. In the front 
section, the air flow is directed past the front wheels with precision by the diffusers. In this way, direct

impact of the flow on the front wheel is reduced. In the rear area, the 2 wind deflectors on the axle and 
the cover of the rear axle differential contribute to optimized underbody flow together with the diffuser, 
which is adapted to suit the motorization.

3. Bodyshell 

3.1. Body structure 

The lightweight body concept of the G05 consists of high-strength and hot-formed steel and 
aluminum components, where the proportion of diecast aluminum and extruded components has 
increased significantly. Compared with the FI 5, the engine supports, front side panel carrier supports 
and various bolted struts are now also made of aluminum. Thanks to the material mix, the materials 
are able to contribute their specific strengths to the vehicle in the best possible way. As a result of 
the strict lightweight construction philosophy, the weight of the body has been reduced by around 
15.5 kg compared with the predecessor FI 5, but crash safety has been further improved and comfort 
enhanced.

4. Body Repair Level 1 

4.1. Repair Level 1 

Taking into account the repair stages of the BMW workshop information system, the body repair work 
in the Technical Training is divided into 3 repair levels. Each of the 3 Body Repair Levels includes 
certain prerequisites in terms of the qualifications of the employees and the workshop equipment. 

The special characteristics of the add-on body parts and the materials used in the outer body skin are 
described in this chapter. However, the basic functions of the roof and the outer body skin components 
made of plastic are the same as on other current BMW models. For this reason, these components will 
not be described in detail here. 

Information on the basic procedure for adjustment work on add-on body parts can be found in the 
Product Information "Body Repair Level 1 " of the standard body training "Body Repair Level 1" 
as well as in the ISTA workshop information system.

As with the predecessor FI 5 the bonnet is made of aluminum. The front side panels and all 4 doors 
are also made of aluminum. This increase in aluminum components leads to a significant reduction in 
weight. The roof and the entire outer side frame are made of deep-drawing steel. 

The front and rear bumper panels as well as the wheel arch and side sill trim panels are made of plastic 
(PP + EPDM) as before. However, further development of this material made it possible to reduce the 
density and thus the weight. 


4.3. Upper section of tailgate 

The tailgate of the G05 is made of two parts, similar to the FI 5. The basic equipment already features 
electric spindle drives on the left and right for the tailgate upper section. The tailgate lock and the drive 
for Automatic Soft Close are fitted in the tailgate lower section.

4.4. Lower section of tailgate 

In combination with the optional equipment Comfort Access on the X5 xDrive 40i (SA 322) the tailgate 
lower section now also opens and closes automatically on the G05. A spindle drive integrated in the 
tailgate moves the tailgate lower section via a kinematic deflection mechanism on the bonnet hinge. 
Here the axial movement of the spindle drive is converted by the kinematic mechanism into a rotational 
movement of the tailgate, enabling the tailgate to open and close by fully automatic means. Opening 
and closing of the tailgate sections can be performed as follows: 

• *Both tailgate sections can be opened or closed with the button in the driver's door. 

• The tailgate upper section can be opened or closed with the button on the ID transmitter. 

• The tailgate upper section can be opened with the outside button on the tailgate. 

• Both tailgate sections can be contactlessly opened or closed with the corresponding foot 
movement. 

• Both tailgate sections close automatically when the button on the tailgate upper section is 
pressed. 

• When the button on the tailgate lower section is pressed, only the tailgate lower section opens 
or closes automatically (optional equipment). 

*The driver can also make an adjustment in the CID under Setting Tailgates so that only the tailgate 
upper section opens or closes with the button in the driver's door trim panel. 

If the check symbol for trailer operation is set in the CID, both tailgate sections can only be opened or 
closed manually with the button on the tailgate sections.

In contrast to the FI 5, where the locks of the tailgate lower section were installed in the tailgate, on the 
G05 the tailgate locks and the associated Soft Close drive are installed in the body side frame. This 
concept reduces the total weight of the tailgate. An emergency release facility is available if the tailgate 
locks malfunction. The relevant tailgate lock can be released by inserting and turning a hexagon socket 
wrench in the direction of the arrow. Failure to observe the correct direction of turning may result in 
damage to the tailgate lock.

5. Heating/Air Conditioning Systems 

Two versions of the integrated automatic heating/air conditioning system (IHKA) are available for the 
G05. The IHKA regulated on the air side is based in part on the G12 and G01. Topics in the table above 
are described in the product information G12 Air Conditioning. 

• 3/2-zone IHKA (standard equipment on the xDrive 40i) 

• 4/3-zone IHKA (optional on the xDrive 40i standard on the xDrive 50i )(SA 4NB) 

From a technical perspective the climate control is divided into zones (e.g. driver, front passenger, 
rear passenger compartment, temperature). The first digit represents the individually adjustable 
temperature settings, whilst the second digit represents the zones in which the amount of air can be 
individually adjusted. With the G05 the IHKA display is installed for the first time between the center 
ventilation outlets. 


5.1.3/2-zone IHKA 

A 3/2-zone IHKA is already installed as basic equipment in the G05. Three different temperature zones 
can be set by the driver/front passenger and in the rear passenger compartment. The amount of air 
can only be regulated by the driver and front passenger. Automatic recirculated air flap control, the 
SYNC function, stratification, etc. can be adjusted in the A/C menu via the CID. In the event of strong 
sunlight, the solar sensor on the windscreen regulates the air conditioning with temperature, amount 
of air and air distribution in such a way that the set temperature is maintained in the vehicle interior.

With the 3/2-zone IHKA, the temperature in the rear passenger compartment is controlled via 
stratification. The amount of air for the rear passenger compartment is supplied via the blower 
installed in the passenger footwell, and this can only be adjusted by the driver or front passenger.

5.2. 4/3-zone IHKA 

With optional equipment (SA 4NB) a 4/3 zone IHKA is installed in the G05 which does not differ 
visually from the driver/front passenger control panel. For the rear passenger compartment an 
additional blower is installed under the driver/front passenger center armrest. Two temperature zones 
and the amount of air can be adjusted via a separate control panel in the rear passenger compartment. 
Individual air distribution and an automatic program are additionally available for the rear passenger 
compartment.

6. Interior Equipment 

6.1. Overview 

The vehicle interior shows significant further developments in comparison to the FI 5. The spatial 
impression and all-round visibility have been improved. This is further supported by the very flat design 
of the roof function center. In addition, the headliner, which is equipped with sound insulation, helps 
to make it noticeably easier for passengers to converse with each other between the first and second 
rows of seats. The new X5 features many design changes: starting with the Central Information 
Display (CID), which is angled slightly towards the instrument cluster; also the integrated A/C control 
panel with display between the center ventilation outlets. The door opener has also been adapted to 
the modern vehicle interior. With the optional equipment heat comfort package (SA 4HB) the front 
seats, armrests in the door trim panels and on the center console and steering wheel are heated.

6.3. Thermoelectric cup holder 

With the optional equipment SA 442 a thermoelectric cup holder is used for the first time in a BMW in 
the G05. This is fitted as usual in front of the selector lever in the center console. The two cup holders 
can be operated separately and differently. Depending on the setting, the color of the light changes 
from blue when cooling to red when heating. A temperature range of approx. 3 °C to 55 °C (37 °F to 
131 °F) is achieved by means of a Peltier element. Drinks cannot be actively cooled down or heated 
up. The function is solely for keeping drinks cold or hot for an extended period.

6.4. Seats 


6.4.1. Front seats 

As a design element, the seats are an important element of a sporty-luxurious vehicle interior. 

The seats provided as standard offer the customer maximum comfort and safety. Special stitching 
accents are provided in the form of decorative stitches for the Venasca leather trim and backstitching 
for the Merino leather trim. All seat adjustments are fully electric. The customer can choose seat 
heating and climate control, backrest width adjustment as well as lumbar support and massage as 
optional equipment. Until now the customer could choose between a basic seat, a sports seat and a 
multifunction seat. In the G05 the sports seat is already installed as the basic seat, version 1 is thus 
discontinued. 

With the Multi-contour seats optional on the xDrive 40i (SA 456) and standard on the xDrive 50i an 
additional button (gentleman function) is installed in the door trim panel on the driver's side. (See 
Overview picture in the section 6.1 Interior equipment no. 14). When this button is pressed by the 
driver, seat adjustment switches from the driver's side to the passenger's side. This is indicated by 
a green LED lighting up on the button. As long as the LED is lit the driver can use the adjustment 
switches on the driver's seat to make the same adjustments for the front passenger seat as for the 
driver's seat.

The multi-contour seat offers the customer maximum comfort. The customer experiences the 
greatest degree of comfort as soon as they get into the vehicle and can travel relaxed even on long 
trips. A massage system in the seat cushion and backrest surfaces can also be ordered for the multi¬ 
contour seat. All possible seat adjustments are fully electric. On the multifunction seat, 5 touch- 
sensitive sensors are integrated in the switches for fore-and-aft seat adjustment. As a result, when 
the adjustment switch is touched a pop-up is opened in the Central Information Display (CID), which 
shows the function and adjustment range of the switch that has been touched. Further information on 
this topic can be found in the Product Information G12 Complete Vehicle.

impression. Functionality is underlined thanks to the easily accessible ISOFIX attachments and the 
cup holders in the center armrest. The usual 40: 20: 40 folding backrest from the established SA 465 
is of tremendous benefit to the customer. This is unlocked in the basic equipment via a cable from the 
luggage compartment or on the backrest. 

Customers can also select seat heating for the front and rear passenger seats as optional equipment 
SA 4HA.

6.4.3. Second row of seats, electric 

In conjunction with the 3rd row of seats the backrest on the 2nd row of seats is adjusted, folded 
down and positioned upright by fully electric means via two electric motors which are installed in the 
backrest. These functions are not available when the lock button for the power windows is activated 
in the driver's door trim panel. Comfort entry for the 3rd row of seats is also provided by fully electric 
means via two electric motors in each case which are installed in the seat cushion surface. Electric 
comfort entry has an anti-trap function which is provided by evaluating the power consumption of the 
electric motors. In addition, electric forward/back adjustment of the individual seats with two electric 
motors by 80 mm provides increased comfort or a larger load space in the luggage compartment. 
These functions are controlled separately by two control units on the left and right. If seats are 
replaced in a vehicle, they must be retaught with the ISTA diagnosis system.

6.4.4. Third row of seats 

The 3rd row of seats + 2-axle air suspension (SA 4UB) is integrated in the luggage compartment and 
cannot be retrofitted. Where necessary, the seats can as on the FI 5 be individually folded down in 
line with the luggage compartment floor to create a flat large compartment surface. The seats are 
unlocked and folded by completely mechanical means. Two cup holders are installed in the center 
console between the seat cushion surfaces.

7.1. Luggage compartment capacity 

The luggage compartment capacity of the new BMW X5 has not changed compared with its 
predecessor FI 5 and remains at 650 liters. In the basic version the G05 has a manual roller cover for 
the luggage compartment which has a separate stowage space under the luggage compartment floor. 
With the optional equipment luggage compartment package (SA 418)- not possible in conjunction 
with the 3rd row of seats, an electric roller cover for the luggage compartment is installed. When the 
tailgate is opened, this roller cover automatically travels completely up to the backrest of the 2nd row 
of seats. When the tailgate is closed, the roller cover also closes automatically. The roller cover can 
also be opened or closed manually by means of two buttons installed in the luggage compartment 
trim panel. If the complete luggage compartment capacity of the G05 with folded-down rear seats 
is required, the roller cover can be electrically retracted under the luggage compartment floor by 
pressing the button in the luggage compartment trim panel. The panel in the luggage compartment 
floor opens and closes automatically with the aid of a separate electric motor. The optional equipment 
space saver spare (SA 300) can be ordered for both equipment specifications (basic roller cover for 
luggage compartment and electric roller cover for luggage compartment).

7.1.1. Electric roller cover for luggage compartment 

The electric roller cover for the luggage compartment has a technical design similar to a panorama 
roof. The roller cover is retracted and opened or closed via two drive cables by an electric motor 
installed under the luggage compartment floor. During opening and closing the roller cover is rolled via 
the drive cables. During retraction under the luggage compartment floor the entire roller cover unit is 
retracted via the same drive cables. The anti-trap facility is provided during retraction by evaluating the 
drive motor's power consumption. 

For the roller cover for the luggage compartment a separate control unit is responsible for the following 
functions: 

• Actuation of the drive motor for the roller cover 

• Actuation of the drive motor for the luggage compartment removable panel 

• Evaluation of the drive motor's power consumption for the anti-trap facility 

• Evaluation of the Hall-effect sensors in the drive motors for position detection

When the roller cover is closed, the sliding carriage is moved over the drive cables into the guide rails. 
If the roller cover hits an obstruction during the closing operation, the roller cover driver is clipped out 
of the sliding carriage. After triggering, the driver must be clipped by hand into the sliding carriage.

7.1.2. Luggage compartment floor 

With the launch of the G05 the optional equipment luggage compartment package (SA 418) is 
extended to include an electric roller cover for the luggage compartment and automatic anti-slip rails. 
4 aluminum-rubber rails integrated in the luggage compartment floor automatically secure the load in 
the luggage compartment after the tailgate sections are closed. Two drive motors under the luggage 
compartment floor automatically extend the rubber rails approximately 3 mm and thereby prevent load 
items from sliding back and forth in the luggage compartment. The rubber rails retract automatically 
when the tailgate sections are opened. If the vehicle is parked on a slope with an angle >13.5°, the 
rubber rails remain extended even when the tailgate sections are opened. This stops any load items 
from falling out of the luggage compartment when the tailgate sections are opened.
