The FlexRay has a data transfer rate of 10 MBit/s. 


2.2.5. Ethernet 

The G01 features the two-wire OABR Ethernet (OPEN Alliance BroadR-Reach) which is familiar from 
the G12. 

The Ethernet variant with 5 lines (4 data lines and 1 activation line) is still used on the G01 by the 
OBD2 interface to the Body Domain Controller. 

Use of the two-wire OABR Ethernet on the G01 

The following control units are connected to the vehicle electrical system via two-wire OABR Ethernet 
in the G01: 

• Active Cruise Control (ACC) 

• Camera-based driver support systems (KAFAS) 

• Top Rear Side View Camera (TRSVC) 

• Rear view camera (RFK). 

The following control units are additionally connected via two-wire OABR Ethernet in the G01: 

• Head unit 

• Optional equipment system (SAS) 

• Telematic Communication Box 

Ethernet in the vehicle 

The standard "Open Alliance BroadR-Reach" (OABR Ethernet) has been specially developed as a 
new data transmission layer for use in vehicles. OABR Ethernet only requires an unshielded twisted 
two-wire connection. OABR Ethernet supports bidirectional 100 MBit/s communication between 2 
nodes. This means that both nodes can simultaneously send and receive at a data transfer rate of 


6 








G01 Voltage Supply and Bus Systems 

2. Bus Systems 

100 MBit/s. OABR Ethernet requires point-to-point networking. This means that the bus system is 
not split up between multiple nodes, as is the case e.g. with CAN (Controller Area Network) systems. 
Instead, Ethernet switches are used for the connection of further nodes. Today, Ethernet switches are 
integrated in the following control units: 

• Body Domain Controller (BDC) 

• Optional equipment system (SAS) 

• Top Rear Side View Camera (TRSVC). 

An Ethernet switch (ENS) is used on the G01 depending on the vehicle equipment. In the event of 
failure of an Ethernet switch, all bus users connected by it are disconnected from the rest of the 
network and are no longer able to communicate via Ethernet. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, the control units are connected to the vehicle electrical 
system in different ways. 

On vehicles without navigation, the data transfer takes place from the Headunit Basic to the 
instrument cluster via Ethernet. 

On vehicles with Navigation, the data is transferred from the Headunit HIGH to the instrument cluster 
via an APIX data cable. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment an Ethernet switch may in some cases be required. 

A wake-up line may be required for control units that are only connected to the Ethernet and 
are not additionally connected to a body CAN. 

Control units on the Ethernet cannot be woken up via the bus. Instead, the control units are activated 
via the wake-up line or switched directly via terminal 15. As a result of the activation via a wake-up line, 
so-called partial network operation is also possible. In partial network operation, individual control units 
can switch to a rest state in different vehicle conditions. 

The different versions of the Ethernet topology of the G01 are listed below: 

Ethernet topology without Ethernet switch on vehicles with Headunit Basic 

The wiring diagram shows the connection of the top rear side view camera (TRSVC) control unit and 
rear view camera (RFK). In the vehicle, either TRSVC is installed for a vehicle with multiple cameras, or 
RFK for a vehicle with a rear view camera (standalone).

rear view camera (RFK). In the vehicle, either TRSVC is installed for a vehicle with multiple cameras, or 
RFK for a vehicle with a rear view camera (standalone). 

On vehicles with the Headunit High, the Telematic Communication Box (TCB) is directly connected to 
the headunit. The data is transferred from the Headunit High to the instrument cluster via APIX. The 
instrument cluster does not require Ethernet. As a result, the Ethernet interfaces on the Body Domain 
Controller are sufficient, and no Ethernet switch (ENS) is required.

Port 4 


The Ethernet switch has a maximum of 5 ports. The Ethernet cable to the Body Domain Controller 
(BDC) is connected to port 0. In addition, voltage for the Ethernet switch is supplied to port 0. The 
other Ethernet control units are connected to ports 1 to 4. The connectors for ports 1 to 4 are 
identical, so the other Ethernet control units can be connected as required. It does not matter which 
control unit is connected to which port as this does not affect the function. However, for diagnosis and 
troubleshooting, it is important to know which control unit is assigned to which port. If the Ethernet 
switch is exchanged or the Ethernet cables in ports 1 to 4 have been connected in a different order, a 
port configuration must be carried out with the diagnosis system ISTA. 

A_ 

Without a port configuration, Ethernet errors cannot be detected and errors can therefore not be 
stored.

4.2.4. Intelligent battery sensor 

The IBS records the following data of the 12V battery: 

• Voltage 

• Current 

• Pole temperature 

The IBS performs the calculation and the evaluation of the information. The results are then forwarded 
to the DME and BDC via LIN bus . 

4.2.5. Safety battery terminal 



Safety battery terminal 


The safety battery terminal (SBK) is activated in the event of an accident of corresponding severity. 
The voltage supply to the positive battery connection point in the engine compartment is interrupted 
and the consumers connected to this are de-energized. The safety battery terminal is installed in the 
power distribution box next to the battery. 

4.2.6. Alternator 

An alternator with increased efficiency is used in the G01. The increase in alternator efficiency is 
achieved by reducing the losses in the rectifier. The loss-causing diodes are replaced by actively 
activated MOSFET transistors. A reduction in fuel consumption is achieved by increasing the 
efficiency. 

Different alternators are used depending on the engine type and vehicle equipment.

The following relays are installed in the rear power distribution box: 

• 2 Relay, terminal 30F 

• 2 Relay, terminal 30B 

• Relay, terminal 15N 

• Relay for rear window heating. 

All relays are bi-stable relays. The relays are activated by the Body Domain Controller via LIN. The 
terminal 30B relay in the front right power distribution box is activated by the rear power distribution 
box. 

4.2.10. Body Domain Controller 

The Body Domain Controller (BDC) is responsible for the terminal control. 

A terminal 30F relay is installed in the BDC. 

A number of consumers are supplied with terminal 30 and terminal 30F and provided with 
corresponding fuse protection via the BDC. 

4.2.11. PCU with vehicle electrical system assistance measure 

BMW vehicles have a high energy consumption due to the many electrical consumers. As a result, 
there is a high demand on the battery, particularly in phases in which the combustion engine is not 
running and the alternator supplies no energy (e.g. engine start-stop phases). 

In order to protect the vehicle battery, a DC/DC converter is installed in the Power Control Unit (PCU) 
and an auxiliary battery in the engine compartment in the G01.

G01 Voltage Supply and Bus Systems 

4. Voltage Supply 

The preconditions for the direction of the energy management are calculated from the use of the 
vehicle. When the engine is running the auxiliary battery is charged from the conventional vehicle 
electrical system. During the phases in which the combustion engine is not running, e.g. automatic 
engine start-stop function, the energy is supplied from the auxiliary battery into the conventional 
vehicle electrical system. 

The Power Control Unit (PCU) contains a control unit which is connected to the PT-CAN2 and the 
DC/DC converter with a power of 500 W.

5. Terminal Control 

5.1. Introduction 

The terminal control in the G01 is identical to the terminal control of the G12. In the G01, the vehicle 
is always in the right condition from the point of view of the customer. The terminals are controlled 
via a customer-oriented condition management. The terminal control is dependent on the driving 
conditions. 

5.2. Vehicle conditions 

The G01 vehicle may be in the following conditions: 

• Parking 

• Residing 

• Driving 

The different vehicle functions are possible depending on the relevant conditions. 

Parking 

• Customer not in the vehicle 

• Vehicle secured or not used for a certain time 

• Vehicle functions cannot be operated. 

Residing 

• Customer in the vehicle 

• No driving readiness 

• Functions that are relevant when the vehicle is stationary can be operated. 

Driving 

• Customer in the vehicle 

• Driving readiness established 

• All functions are available. 

The driving conditions are changed by condition management, taking into account the customer 
behavior. Additional information is also evaluated that may help to determine the vehicle condition, 
e.g.: 

• Door opening 

• Door closing 

• Operations in the vehicle.

Automatic switch-off 


Switch off after door opening: 

In the menu "Doors/Keys", an immediate change from the vehicle condition RESIDING to the vehicle 
condition PARKING can be activated. 

If this option is activated, then the system will immediately change to the vehicle condition PARKING 
when the driver's door is opened. The elimination of the after-running period in the residing vehicle 
condition saves energy. 


5.3. Power supply terminals 

Control units in the vehicle must be supplied with power only when they are needed. The following 
terminals are used in the G01: 

• Terminal 15N 

• Terminal 30B 

• Terminal 30F 

• Terminal 30 

Terminal 15N supplies control units which are needed only when driving and which may be needed to 
safely end a journey. After-run of 5 s starts at the transition from DRIVING to RESIDING. 

Terminal 30B is used to supply control units that are needed in the stationary mode RESIDING and for 
stationary functions where the customer is not in the vehicle. An after-run of 6 minutes starts at the 
transition from RESIDING to PARKING, and terminal 30B is then switched off. 

Terminal 30F is used to supply control units which must perform functions in PARKING condition. 
Terminal 30F is normally switched on in PARKING condition, but may be switched off due to faults in 
the vehicle electrical system. The terminal is switched off with an after-running period of 1 min if a fault 
is detected.

Testing-analysis-diagnosis (PAD) mode 

The vehicle condition testing-analysis-diagnosis is still present for diagnosis. All terminals are 
switched on in this mode. This ensures that diagnosis can be performed with all control units. This 
vehicle condition is displayed in the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 

Activation of the PAD mode: 

• Operation of the start/stop button (three times within 0.8 s) + valid remote control or valid ID 
transmitter in the vehicle interior 

• By the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 

The PAD mode is exited by pressing the start/stop button or by closing the diagnosis with the 
diagnosis system ISTA. 


5.4. Partial network operation 

Today's premium vehicles contain up to 70 control units with well over 100 microcontrollers which are 
networked with each other. However, depending on the current vehicle condition or the vehicle user 
requirement, not all convenience and assistance systems may always be needed. 

It is possible to save energy, relieve the load on the battery and also prolong the battery life by targeted 
deactivation and activation on control units which are not needed, so-called selective partial network 
operation. 

In vehicles with combustion engine, the electrical energy consumption is indirectly linked to the fuel 
consumption via the alternator. As a result, selective deactivation of control units that are not currently 
needed can contribute to reducing fuel consumption and thus also C0 2 emissions.

5. Terminal Control 

5.4.1. Partial network operation when driving 

If functions are not used or needed when driving, e.g.: 

• Seat adjustment 

• Trailer lighting (no trailer attached) 

the corresponding control units can be switched off. 

5.4.2. Prerequisites for partial network operation 

The partial network primary in the Body Domain Controller calculates a partial network status on 
the basis of the current vehicle condition and the required functions. The control units that are not 
required are switched off by means of the corresponding bus messages. 

5.4.3. Prerequisites of control units for partial network operation 

Different transceivers are used in order to realize partial network operation in control units. These 
transceivers are able to evaluate and interpret messages. This control unit remains switched off as 
long as any bus communication takes place without a valid wake-up event for the corresponding 
control unit being present. If a valid wake-up event for the corresponding control unit is sent on the 
bus, the transceiver can activate the voltage regulator of the microcontroller and the control unit starts 
up. The control unit is switched off by deactivation of the voltage regulator. 

5.4.4. Partial network operation when the vehicle is stationary and the engine 
is switched off 

For example, if only the radio function is required when the engine is switched off, the bus systems 
which are not required are switched off. If an operation is then carried out with the controller, for 
example, the buses are woken up again. Once the operation has been carried out, the bus systems 
which are not required are switched off again. Switching off the bus systems which are not required 
along with the corresponding control units saves energy. The reduced energy consumption means, for 
example, that it is possible to play the radio for significantly longer before it is switched off due to the 
battery being too drained.
