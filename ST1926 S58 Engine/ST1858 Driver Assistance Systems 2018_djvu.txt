Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

1. Introduction 


Assistance systems are becoming more and more advanced and also taking on increasing levels of 
the volume segment. Semi-automated driving (Level 2) is achieved today with the systems currently 
available at BMW. 

Road accidents are frequently caused by human error, however, the individual is also the best 
preventer of accidents. Current assistance systems are at a very high technical level, but can certainly 
still not replace the intelligence of a person in certain situations. 

To date the driver is responsible for the driving all the time, even if systems allow the driver to take his 
hands off the steering wheel for a few seconds, therefore relieving the driver considerably especially 
on long journeys. This also applies to the next levels of automation, which at first do not release the 
driver from his responsibility. 

BMW still represents "The Ultimate Driving Machine". This pleasure will become even more diverse 
in the future. For instance, the customer will have the option to experience both the "The Ultimate 
Driving Machine" or in future also "The Ultimate Automated Driving Machine", depending on the 
situation. 

Today motorists spend many hours every year in congestion in urban areas without being able to make 
good use of their time. The new way of driving will lead to significantly more comfort. Passengers 
including the driver can make better use of the journey time and at the same time can, for example, 
relax, work, read or enjoy modern multimedia and information systems. 

The generic term BMW Personal CoPilot is becoming increasingly important, as the assistance 
systems and activities on the road to highly and fully automated driving and autonomous parking are 
summarized here. 


1.1. The road to "Autonomous driving" 



The 5 levels of Autonomous driving 


i 





































Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

1. Introduction 


A classification into different automation levels describes how man and machine interact with each 
other on the road today and in the future. For instance, with a "Level 5 vehicle" the driver has the 
option to transfer the driving task to the vehicle. 


1.1.1. Assisted driving 

Level 1 



Cfr 

lO 

£NJ 


eg 

LU 


Current assistance systems support the driver when driving, 
thus ensuring enhanced safety and comfort. Systems, such 
as the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function, which 
independently controls the distance to the vehicle ahead, 
or the Front collision mitigation and Daytime Pedestrian 
Protection, which can ideally prevent collisions by an 
automatic braking process, are classified in Level 1. 


1.1.2. Semi-automated driving 

Level 2 



Semi-automated assistance systems, like the Steering 
Assistant including Traffic Jam Assistant, facilitate life on 
the road. The systems brake and accelerate automatically. 

In contrast to Level 1, they are also able to take over at the 
steering wheel. 

With semi-automated driving the driver is still responsible for 
the vehicle control and cannot ignore traffic conditions. 


1.1.3. Highly automated driving 

Level 3 



In Level 3 the driver is further relieved and gains more and 
more freedom. Linder certain conditions the driver can look 
away from traffic conditions continuously by delegating 
the driving tasks completely to the vehicle. From this level 
the vehicle is already able to drive longer distances and 
completely independently in certain traffic situations using 
highly automated systems. 

The driver must also be able to resume the driving within a 
few seconds, e.g. on approaching a construction site or within 
various system limits.

Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

1. Introduction 

1.1.4. Fully automated driving 

Level 4 



Level 4 is the precursor to autonomous driving. The vehicle is 
able to navigate the larger part of its journey independently. 
From a technical perspective the vehicle is so advanced that it 
can overcome highly complex urban traffic situations without 
the intervention of the driver. If certain situations occur, which, 
for example, push the system to its limits, the driver must still 
be fit to drive in order to be able to assume driving if necessary. 
It is certainly conceivable that the driver may, for example, 
sleep temporarily during the journey. If the driver ignores the 
warnings, then the systems have the authority to transfer 
the vehicle to a safe state. This could be done, e.g. with an 
automatic brake intervention. 


1.1.5. Autonomous driving 

Level 5 





r— 


co 


Whereas for Level 3 and 4 both the driver's fitness to drive and 
a valid driving license are required, this is no longer important 
with fully autonomous driving. The vehicle assumes the driving 
task here completely. The steering wheel and the pedal thus 
become superfluous. 

From a technical point of view, the vehicle can also be 
moved without a driver. The presence of a driver is no longer 
absolutely necessary. 

As the complexity of the technical solutions is extremely high, 
completely autonomous vehicles will initially be on the road 
with relatively low speeds, in restricted areas of the urban 
environment or on selected highway sections.

1.2. Future mobility 



Future mobility 


Digitalization is constantly changing more and more areas of our everyday life - also our individual 
mobility. Smart assistance systems, as well as digital operating concepts by touchscreen, gestures or 
voice input, have long become an established reality. 


Looking forward to "Future mobility", besides the advancing digitalization in relation to 
ConnectedDrive, the BMW Group is also increasing its focus on autonomous driving. 


Autonomous vehicles must be able to communicate with the environment and respond independently 
to dangers.

TE1B-1252 









Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

1. Introduction 



Vehicle networking 


This is where both the networking of vehicles as well as high-precision and real-time navigation maps 
set in and form important modules for autonomous driving. 

It is for this reason the BMW Group together with two competitors purchased the company HERE. 

In the future BMW Group vehicles will have the map version "HERE HD Live Map", which is able to 
combine high-resolution map data with real-time information of other vehicles. 

Real Time Traffic Information (RTTI) as well as the Hazard Preview represent an initial attribute of the 
exchange of real-time information. The Car-to-X-Communication still forms the basis for the data 
exchange.

TElfi-1477 



























Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

1. Introduction 



Hazard Preview 


The development of the 5G standard, as well as the creation of an appropriate infrastructure for 
autonomous vehicles, will substantially influence the next development stages towards autonomous 
driving. 

In the area of communication there is also a need that autonomous vehicles share their intentions with 
other road users. Besides the technology, the social aspects are important, i.e. the way the vehicle, for 
example, communicates with a pedestrian. 

One approach in this direction may be that an autonomous vehicle projects a virtual pedestrian 
crossing on the road in order to indicate to a pedestrian that the vehicle stops itself and gives right of 
way to the pedestrian. 

1.2.1. Artificial Intelligence 

In the automotive area Artificial Intelligence (Al) is a key topic and is important not only in production. 

Al will also play an important role in the future for the use of the vehicles, whether for autonomous 
driving, mobility services or communication. 

How is this to be viewed now in connection with autonomous vehicles? And why is Al so important in 
the future? 

Let's take two examples which show subjects that need to be clarified. 

A person has the gift of storing things he has seen once and easily recognizing them again. 


6 






























Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

1. Introduction 


Take the example of a pedestrian crossing, which is easily recognized as such by the person - and 
independent of the color of the stripes. However, a machine would possibly have a problem here as 
color changes are not automatically taken into account. Whereas in the traffic environment it is not 
uncommon that the color of the stripes is always white. 

Second example: A shrub or a hedge is recognized as a stationary obstacle - but what happens with 
shrubs or hedges whose leaves are moving? For the individual actually no problem - whereas the 
vehicle could misinterpret this and detect a moving object instead of a shrub. 

In addition to the networking and communication with the environment, in the future vehicles must 
also be able to interpret various situations in order to be able to respond accordingly. 



Artificial Intelligence 


This is where Artificial Intelligence comes into effect, which ultimately makes possible "autonomous 
driving" at a safe level. 

1.2.2. Big data 

An autonomous vehicle generates roughly one GB of data per second. Solely on the basis of this 
figure, it can be deduced that apart from all the aforementioned topics an efficient data management 
system is indispensable. Intelligent solutions are necessary here as with these data volumes even 5G 
standard can reach its limits. 

1.2.3. BMW CarData 

The BMW Group already offers its customers innovative and customized services in the area of 
individual mobility. BMW CarData was introduced in order to be able to integrate services of third 
parties. 

With BMW CarData the customer has control of his data and can decide what should happen to the 
data. In his ConnectedDrive account the customer can carry out settings which allow status data such 
as the odometer reading, usage-based data like the average fuel consumption or event data such as 
eCall to be transferred to the back end.

Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

1. Introduction 


Service providers (so-called third-party providers) can obtain data they need for certain services with 
the customer's consent. This data is transmitted encrypted in order to guarantee data security. 

To sum up, for the customer BMW CarData means security and control of the data from his own 
vehicle - and this combined with the many benefits of the customized services. 

The customer can request a CarData report at any time via the ConnectedDrive portal in the CarData 
archive. The CarData report provides information about which data has been forwarded. Apart from 
security, maximum transparency for the customer is also guaranteed. 


1.2.4. Mobility Services 



Mobility services 


The BMW Group is pushing a mobility concept that builds on sustainability and links mobility services 
together intelligently. For example, for the market introduction of the BMW i3 intermodal route 
planning was presented, which takes into consideration public transport in the route selection. 


Car sharing programs such as DriveNow or mobility services like ChargeNow and ParkNow are also 
available.

1. Introduction 

1.2.5. Legal basic conditions 



Legal basic conditions 


In addition to the technical challenges, the following years will be characterized by the establishment 
of a legal framework for the next level in order to ultimately pave the way for "autonomous driving". 

With regard to legal basic conditions, ethics committees have already compiled a set of rules, which 
can be built upon, but do not yet answer all questions thoroughly. Worldwide uniform implementation 
or control will be something of an illusion here. 

As a result, the future offer structure of the assistance systems within the BMW model range will be 
different, and the operating principle of the systems will also differ in the future depending on the 
national-market version. 

For example, the Automatic Lane Change with vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018 will be 
introduced for the first time for the USA as a "new" system, whereas the system will be dropped in the 
EU owing to a change in legislation. 

1.2.6. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology 

In addition to the subject matter, new sensors are also required in the future to drive vehicle 
networking for highly automated and fully automated driving. 

For example, the familiar optical cameras, as well as the radar and ultrasonic sensors, are extended in 
the future with Lidar-based sensor technology.

Overview of sensor types 




Surround View cameras 


KAFAS camera 





Lidar sensor 


Even in difficult situations, such as direct sunlight or darkness, sensors which work according to Light 
Detection and Ranging technology are able to adequately map the vehicle environment. 

The designation Lidar is derived from the operating principle and essentially means "Light Detection 
and Ranging". A Lidar sensor scans the surrounding area and generates a 3D image of the 
surroundings. The operating principle or principle of a Lidar itself is similar to that of a radar - with the 
difference that a laser beam is emitted here. 

The signals emitted via laser are received by the Lidar by means of multispectral cameras. 
Multispectral cameras are characterized by the fact that they can absorb the bouncing light of the 
laser (from the surface of the object) in several wavelengths. The bouncing light of the laser can also 
be received by means of a special integrated chip. Technically, this would mean that the multispectral 
cameras could be deleted. 


10 

























Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

1. Introduction 



Which reception mode wins through in the end, or whether one solution is used one time and another 
solution the next time depending on the vehicle model, remains to be seen. 


In addition to the pure object detection, the distance to the object as well as its speed can be 
evaluated using the Lidar technology. 



Overview: Sensor types in the network 

It appears that the Lidar will become the most important link between the vehicle and vehicle 
environment in the sensor network.

Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

1. Introduction 

1.2.7. Preparation for Level 3 

The BMW Group aims to make highly automated driving a reality for customers in the near future. 

With the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018, the Driver Camera System (DCS) is used for the 
first time and thus forms a further basis for (semi-)automated driving functions. 

A reliable analysis of the situation around the vehicle is one of the prerequisites for highly or fully 
automated driving and is guaranteed with environment sensors. 

Data from six information clusters is required. The clusters are divided up as follows: 

♦ Road users 

♦ Static environment 

♦ Information on traffic regulations 

♦ Reliable driving lane map data 

♦ Exact current position of the vehicle 

♦ Driver status. 

Each sensor applies its own approach for the detection and interpretation of the environment. With the 
fusion of this data the calculation of a circular model is possible in the end. 

With the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018 new generations of sensors are used. More 
information about these new sensors can be found in the course of this product information. 

New systems also find their way into different BMW derivatives to varying degrees. The optional 
equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU) and BMW Live Cockpit Professional 
(SA 6U3) round off the new alignment. 

Whereas Active Driving Assistant Professional represents the spearhead of the available systems, 
the BMW Live Cockpit Professional makes possible an advanced visualization of the different driving 
conditions. 


1.3. Further information 

An extended offer of driver assistance systems is available to the customer with the introduction of 
the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018. New systems as well as components represent yet 
another stepping stone towards automated driving. 

In this product information you find an overview of the new possible assistance systems, as well as 
changes which are being rolled out with the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018. The systems 
already known from the G12, G30, as well as the G01, are not described in this product information. 
Further information, as well as an overview of the assistance systems of the G05 and the G15, can be 
found in the individual product information of the respective derivatives. 

For more information on the operating concept of the assistance systems, please refer to the Owner's 
Handbook.

2.1. KAFAS 

Both the KAFAS mono and the KAFAS stereo camera are currently used at BMW with the vehicle 
electrical system Service Pack 2015, depending on the vehicle model as well as taking into account 
the optional equipment. The two camera systems are very different: 

♦ The KAFAS mono camera comprises a camera lens and an image sensor and works based on 
object classification. Distances to the detected object can also be calculated using complex 
algorithms. 

♦ Whereas, the KAFAS stereo camera has two camera lenses and two image sensors and 
generates a 3D image from the comparison of the images taken simultaneously. Distances can 
be measured directly with the 3D image (within the system limits). 

As the requirements of the KAFAS camera have increased once again, two new KAFAS camera 
variants are used with the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018. 

2.1.1. KAFAS Mid camera 

Compared to the previous KAFAS mono cameras used at BMW, the KAFAS Mid camera offers the 
following advantages: 

♦ Extended range for object detection 

♦ Larger field of view 

♦ Considerably higher computing capacity 

♦ Better performance after dark.

2.1.2. KAFAS High camera 

The familiar KAFAS stereo camera from the G12 is replaced with the KAFAS High camera. The brand 
new camera has three camera lenses. There is a fisheye lens for close range, one for medium range 
and one for the data fusion with radar sensors at distances of up to 250 m. 



KAFAS High camera 


2.1.3. Functional limitations 

The function of the KAFAS camera and thus the function of the corresponding assistance systems 
may be impaired due to the physical limits of the optical systems, for example in the following 
situations: 

♦ Heavy fog, rain, spray or snow 

♦ Strong light in the camera lens 

♦ If the viewing aperture of the KAFAS camera or the windscreen is dirty 

♦ On tight bends 

♦ If boundary lines are missing, worn, poorly visible, converging or diverging, or not clearly 
recognizable, as may be the case when roadworks are being carried out 

♦ If boundary lines are covered by snow, ice, dirt or water 


15 



Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

2. Sensors 

• If boundary lines are covered by objects 

• If driving at close proximity to a vehicle driving ahead 

• If the windscreen in front of the interior mirror is misted over, soiled or covered by stickers, 
e.g. inspection stickers, etc. 

• Up to 10 seconds after driving readiness is activated via the start/stop button 

• During the calibration process for the KAFAS camera immediately after vehicle delivery or a 
camera change. 

A 


Due to functional limitations and system restrictions it may transpire that warnings and orders are not 
issued, are issued too late or are unwarranted. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively 
intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident. 


2.2. Radar sensors 

Different types of radar sensors are required for (semi-)automated driving. The radar sensors are 
responsible for near or distance monitoring. Also with the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018 
a total of six control units can be used as radar sensors. 

In order to create more transparency, the radar sensors were provided with new terminology on the 
part of diagnosis. The new terminology is explained below. 

2.2.1. Front radar sensor 

The front radar sensor (FRS) is a new development and is used for the first time with the series launch 
of the new BMW X5.

2.4. Driver Camera System 

The status of the driver must be known in phases of (semi-)automated driving. The Driver Camera 
System (DCS) attached at the instrument cluster assumes this task. 



Driver Camera System (DCS)

Explanation

Driver Camera System (DCS) 


An infrared camera integrated in the Driver Camera System (DCS) makes it possible to detect the 
driver's viewing direction. Using the detected data, the Driver Camera System (DCS) control unit must 
be able to assess the status of the driver's alertness. 

In addition to the detection of the viewing direction and an assessment of the tiredness of the driver, 
the driver monitoring also allows an evaluation of the eye opening state. The evaluation has a direct 
influence on the Fatigue Alert and, if necessary, permits a faster warning, irrespective of the driver's 
steering behavior. 

The Front collision mitigation and Intersection collision warning also use the data provided by the 
Driver Camera System (DCS) control unit. A driver's inattentiveness detected by the system influences 
the calculation for the warning levels and the driver warning can take place earlier if need be. 

The Driver Camera System (DCS) is another basis for (semi-)automated driving functions. At a later 
stage the Driver Camera System (DCS) will be used in vehicles with Steering Assistant including 
Traffic Jam Assistant in order to achieve an unrestricted hands-off time span in certain conditions. 

If the driver's alertness is detected, it is no longer necessary that the driver has to touch the steering 
wheel during driving. In order to ensure that the driver continues to observe the traffic conditions, the 
system checks whether the driver's gaze is towards the road at certain intervals.

The function of the Driver Camera System can, for example, be restricted in the following cases: 

• When the Driver Camera System (DCS) is covered by, 
e.g. the steering wheel rim or other objects. 

♦ When the driver is wearing anti-infrared sunglasses.

3. Operating Elements "New Features" 

3.1. Control panels at the multifunction steering wheel 

3.1.1. Visualization 

Due to a legal change the visualization of the status detection of some assistance systems had to be 
changed. This is why in vehicles with the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional 
(SA 5AU) the control panels of the assistance systems have been redesigned at the multifunction 
steering wheel. In this case the control panels each have an integrated LED strip.

The two LED strips flash analogously to the assistance system displays in the instrument cluster 
and thus represent an additional visualization, e.g. if the driver is requested to resume control of the 
steering. 

Note: 

♦ Green: The assistance system is active and assumes lateral guidance 

♦ Yellow: Interruption of the assistance system pending 

♦ Red: The assistance system is deactivated. 


33 





























Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

3. Operating Elements "New Features" 

The two LED strips can be switched on and off via the Drive menu by making the following selection 
via the controller: 

• "CAR" 

• "Settings" 

• "Driver Assistance" 

• "Feedback via steering wheel" 

• "Light elements". 



Index 

Explanation

3.1.2. Operating concept 

To be able to facilitate easy operation of the ever-increasing Driver Assistance Systems without 
additional buttons, the operation of the Driver Assistance Systems has been changed with the optional 
equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU). The Assist button is pressed to activate 
the Driver Assistance System. Then, by pressing the MODE button, the vehicle will cycle between two 
Driver Assistance Systems: either ACC Stop&Go or ACC Stop&Go with Steering Assistant (including 
Traffic Jam Assistant.) The chosen system is now active. Pressing the Assist button while the system 
is active will deactivate the system. 

Note: Changing the Driver Assistance System mode is only possible when the system is active. 

Example: The driver is using ACC Stop&Go and would like to engage the Steering Assistant. Pressing 
the MODE button would then select the Steering Assistant with ACC Stop&Go to be able to use 
both functions. If the Assist button is pressed now, Steering Assistant is deactivated together with 
ACC Stop&Go. 

The Driver Assistance Systems which can be selected with the MODE button are displayed to the 
driver in the instrument cluster in the form of a selection list.

Another new feature in the area of the operating elements is the deletion of the "deadman function" 
for Automatic Parking. This means that the driver does not have to hold down the parking assistance 
button during the parking maneuver as before. It is sufficient to press the button once to perform 
Automatic Parking.

4. Collision/Pedestrian Warning 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, a distinction is made between three different technical variants. 

• Vehicles which have the standard equipment Active Driving Assistant (SA 5AS) and without 
the optional equipment Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function (SA 5DF) as well as 
without the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU) — receive the 
camera-based Front collision mitigation/Daytime Pedestrian Protection functions. 

• The camera-based Front collision mitigation/Daytime Pedestrian Protection functions are 
realized using the KAFAS Mid camera. The KAFAS Mid camera captures the setting in front 
of the vehicle and based on the calculated positions, distances and relative speeds of the 
potential collision objects issues the corresponding warning levels. 

*The maximum attainable drop in speed by the brake intervention is roughly 50 km/h. 

• Vehicles which have the optional equipment Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function 
(SA 5DF) and without the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU), 
receive a KAFAS Mid camera as well as the front radar sensor (FRS). 

The activation of the warning levels is primarily effected based on the data of the front radar 
sensor (FRS). In addition, the data of the KAFAS Mid camera is used for the plausibility check 
of stationary objects. 

*The maximum attainable drop in speed by the brake intervention is roughly 60 km/h. 

• Vehicles with the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU) have a 
KAFAS High camera and a front radar sensor long range (FRSF). 

Here the warning levels are mainly activated based on the data of the front radar sensor long 
range (FRSF). In addition, the data of the KAFAS High camera is used for the plausibility check 
of stationary objects. 

*The maximum attainable drop in speed by the brake intervention is roughly 80 km/h. 



*The actual maximum drop in speed by the brake intervention is largely dependent on the situation 
(e.g. by the quality of the road surface). 


Note: 


Deviations from the aforementioned sensor assignment are possible depending on the different 
optional equipment / vehicle models, as well as the national-market versions. 

Functional enhancement of Daytime Pedestrian Protection: 

Daytime Pedestrian Protection now also takes cyclists into consideration with the introduction of the 
vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018 for a G05 or G15. 



The Front collision mitigation function is dependent on the vehicle's own driving speed. The distance 
measured for the Front collision mitigation function is significantly lower than the legally required 
minimum distance. It is therefore the responsibility of the driver to adhere to the legal minimum 
distance. 

Due to functional limitations and system restrictions it may transpire that warnings and orders are not 
issued, are issued too late or are unwarranted. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively 
intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident. 


38 





Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

4. Collision/Pedestrian Warning 

Daytime Pedestrian Protection does not relieve the driver of his responsibility to adapt the speed and 
driving style to the traffic conditions. 


39 



Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

5. Intersection Collision Warning 


The Intersection collision warning is extended with the city braking function with the introduction of 
the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018. An automatic brake intervention is also effected for 
the first time if an acute warning was previously issued. 


The supporting brake intervention is realized in a speed range from approximately 10 km/h to 80 km/h. 
The force of the brake intervention is adjusted depending on the situation. 






Intersection collision warning 


As an extremely exact environment detection is required for this function, the data of the KAFAS High 
camera, the front radar sensor long range (FRSF), as well as the side radar sensors short range front 
right and front left, is evaluated. 


Apart from the acute warning, the Intersection collision warning now also has an advance warning. 
This allows the driver to be able to respond to a critical situation in advance. 


The warning time of the Intersection collision warning with city braking function can be adjusted 
together with the Front collision mitigation and Daytime Pedestrian Protection functions in the iDrive 
menu. The range of adjustment was summarized under the submenu item "Front collision warning".

TE1B-1609 

























Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

5. Intersection Collision Warning 



Adjust warning time "Front collision warning" (example of G05) 

A setting can be made in the iDrive menu as follows: 

• "CAR" 

• "Settings" 

• "Driver assistance" 

• "Safety and warnings" 

• "Front collision warning" 

The configuration menu "Safety and warnings" can also be accessed quickly by pressing the 
Intelligent Safety button. 

The Intersection collision warning with city braking function is part of the optional equipment Active 
Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU). 

A 


The Intersection collision warning with city braking function does not relieve the driver of personal 
responsibility for correctly judging the visibility and traffic situation. The driver's driving style should be 
adapted to the traffic conditions. The driver should check the traffic conditions and react accordingly if 
required. 


41 









Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

6. Lane Departure Warning 

The Lane Departure Warning is an element of the standard equipment Active Driving Assistant 
(SA 5AS) and the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU). 

With the introduction of the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018, a steering intervention is now 
possible if the vehicle is equipped with the standard equipment Active Driving Assistant (SA 5AS). 

In Service Pack 2015 vehicles, the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Plus (SA 5AT) was 
required to initiate steering intervention. 

The steering intervention ensures the vehicle is returned to its own lane if necessary. 



42 







Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

7. Evasion Assistant 


The Evasion Assistant is now a component of the new optional equipment Active Driving Assistant 
Professional (SA 5AU). 

With the introduction of the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018, pedestrians are now also 
considered for the first time. The system also provides support when a pedestrian or cyclist must be 
avoided. 

A 


The Evasion Assistant does not release the driver from his full responsibility as the driver. There can be 
functional limitations because of system restrictions. 


43 





G05 Emergency Stop Assistant 


8.1. Operating principle 

After manual activation, the Emergency Stop Assistant assumes both the longitudinal and lateral 
guidance in order to bring the vehicle into a safe state. 


It is a situation which is gladly ignored and not talked about but can happen to anyone. "The driver 
suffers a blackout at the wheel during the journey". 


In this worst case scenario the driver (if possible) can access the Emergency Stop Assistant in order to 
safely stop the vehicle within the framework of the system limits. Other passengers in the vehicle also 
have the option to press the Emergency Stop Assistant if needed. 


The Emergency Stop Assistant is a component of the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant 
Professional (SA 5AU) and is used for the first time with the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 
2018. 


Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

8. Emergency Stop Assistant 


44 


TE18-1327 








Driver Assistance Systems 2018 

8. Emergency Stop Assistant 

The assumption of the longitudinal and lateral guidance by the system is restricted to a maximum of 
approximately 2 minutes. 

The characteristics of the lateral guidance are very different depending on the country. While in one 
version the Emergency Stop Assistant only keeps the vehicle in the lane and introduces a deceleration 
until the vehicle comes to a standstill, there is another version which also performs an Automatic Lane 
Change in order to safely stop the vehicle on the hard shoulder or emergency lane. 

A possible Automatic Lane Change is realized in a speed range from approximately 70 km/h to 
100 km/h. 

After activation* of the system via the electromechanical parking brake button, first the hazard-warning 
lights are automatically activated. At the same time, the emergency call (eCall) is activated via the TCB. 
Within the first 7 seconds after placing the emergency call there is the option to cancel the call by one 
of the passengers. 

*An activation of the Emergency Stop Assistant is possible from a speed of approximately 10 km/h. 

In addition, the environment is interpreted by the vehicle sensor system and a control strategy is 
calculated using this data - before a possible Automatic Lane Change is effected and the vehicle is 
stopped by the system. 

After the vehicle has decelerated to a standstill, the selector lever position P is automatically engaged, 
the electromechanical parking brake is activated and the central locking system is unlocked. The 
interior lighting is also automatically switched on and the hazard-warning lights are still active in order 
to warn vehicles behind. 

The switched-on interior lighting also ensures that other road users can better detect the situation of 
the driver and if necessary perform first aid. 

When the vehicle comes to a standstill the Auto Start/Stop function is suppressed in order to continue 
to guarantee both the function of the air conditioning and the front and rear seat heating. The 
parameters previously set by the driver remain unchanged. 

During the maneuver the vehicle electrical power system is preconditioned in order to guarantee 
maximum availability. 


8.1.1. Control strategies 

The following three control strategies are implemented: 

♦ Bring the vehicle to a standstill at the right edge of the roadway (right-hand traffic). 

♦ Bring the vehicle to a standstill in its own lane. 

♦ Bring the vehicle to a standstill without crosswise direction requirement. 

Control strategies on highways 

The following graphics show the control strategies on highways with right-hand traffic:

8. Emergency Stop Assistant 

8.1.2. Country-specific operating principle 

The Emergency Stop Assistant is available in the USA, Canada and China. The assistant is not 
available in other countries initially due to a legal restriction. This means the Emergency Stop 
Assistant is not offered, e.g. for the European market. 

Operating principle in the USA and Canada: 

After pressing the button for the electromechanical parking brake, the vehicle is decelerated in a 
controlled manner and an Automatic Lane Change* is introduced in order to decelerate the vehicle to 
a standstill on the hard shoulder. 

A 


*lf this is possible within the framework of the system limits and if the evaluated data of the 
environment detection is positive (no obstacle detected). 


8.2. Deactivation criteria 

After the Emergency Stop Assistant is activated the maneuver introduced is automatically deactivated 
in the following situations: 

♦ The electromechanical parking brake button is pressed again 

♦ The accelerator pedal is operated 

♦ The driver or front passenger intervenes in the steering 

♦ The turn indicator is used 

♦ The function is cancelled in the iDrive menu by a passenger 

♦ A drive position change is carried out by the driver when the vehicle is at a standstill.

9. Cruise Control 

9.1. Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function. 

With the optional equipment Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function (SA 5DF), the new front 
radar sensor (FRS) is used with the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018. The adjustment 
range for the set speed is limited to a maximum of 160 km/h with this optional equipment. This was 
implemented as the front radar sensor (FRS) has a lower range in a direct comparison with the front 
radar sensor long range (FRSF). 

In vehicles with the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU) the set speed 
is limited as before to maximum 180 km/h. 


9.2. Speed Limit Assistant 

Speed Limit Assistant is introduced to the US market with Service Pack 2018. The range of 
functions of the Speed Limit Assistant is available for the following systems depending on the vehicle 
equipment: 

♦ Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function (SA 5DF) 

• Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU). 

With Speed Limit Assistant the speed limit can be adopted, after driver confirmation, as the new set 
speed when the cruise control is activated. 

Manual adoption of the speed limit (as indicated by Speed Limit Info) is executed by pressing the 
“SET button” on the multifunction steering wheel (MFL).

10. Automatic Parking 

Automatic Parking was previously known as Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA). The control 
module is still referred to as PMA in technical systems. 

Automatic Parking is included in the optional equipment Parking Assistant Plus (SA 5DN). Until now, 
the driver was only able to use the system to park the vehicle. 

With the introduction of the vehicle electrical system Service Pack 2018, the driver also has the option 
to use Automatic Parking when leaving the parking space. 

Another new feature is the deletion of the "deadman function" for Automatic Parking. This means that 
the driver does not have to hold down the parking assistance button during the parking maneuver as 
before. It is sufficient to press the button once to perform Automatic Parking. 


10.1. Maneuvering out of a parking space 

The parking space exit function is available for parking spaces which are parallel to the roadway 
(parallel parking). 



G05 view, parking space exit function in the CID (leaving parking space by means of Automatic Parking) 

A completely automatic leaving parking space maneuver is not realized here. 

The system assumes acceleration, braking and steering until the vehicle comes to a stop in such a way 
that it can be driven by the driver out of the parking space without further steering wheel movement. 
The necessary drive position changes and switching on the turn indicator are likewise performed by 
the PMA. The LED lights of the multifunction steering wheel light up green here. 

A number of functional requirements must be met to enable Automatic Parking to maneuver out of the 
parking space automatically: 

♦ The vehicle must have been maneuvered into the parking space with Automatic Parking 
beforehand 

♦ An obstacle must be detected in front of the vehicle 

♦ The parking space must be at least 0.8 m longer than the vehicle.

The driver remains responsible for leaving the parking space and entering traffic. 


10.2. Parking 

Another new feature of Automatic Parking is the fully automatic implementation. The driver no longer 
has to continuously press the PMA button during the parking maneuver. A once-off activation suffices 
and the parking maneuver is performed fully automatically from start to finish. The driver also no longer 
has to activate the turn indicator, it is automatically activated. 

A 


The driver still remains responsible for parking in a parking space. 


10.3. Deactivation criteria 

Automatic Parking is switched off automatically when the following events occur: 

♦ the driver holds on to the steering wheel or steers himself 

♦ a gear is selected that does not correspond to the instruction on the 
Central Information Display 

♦ when accelerating 

♦ the parking brake is secured 

♦ the turn indicator opposite the required parking side is switched on 

♦ at speeds above approximately 10 km/h 

♦ possibly on snow-covered or slippery roads 

♦ the tailgate is open 

♦ possibly if there are objects which are difficult to overcome, e.g. curbs 

♦ if obstructions suddenly appear 

♦ a maximum number of parking maneuvers or the parking duration has been exceeded. 



Automatic Parking cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the traffic situation. Also check 
the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking around, otherwise there may be a risk of an accident 
as a result of road users or objects which lie outside the detection range of the Park Distance Control. 
Loud sound sources outside and inside the vehicle may mask the acoustic signals of the Parking 
Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) or the Park Distance Control (PDC).

11. Back-up Assistant 

The Back-up Assistant is a component of the optional equipment Parking Assistant Plus (SA 5DN). 

The assistant supports the driver when reversing, e.g. from entrances, streets or in multi-story parking 
garages. The Back-up Assistant assumes the lateral guidance and the driver is responsible for the 
longitudinal guidance and can concentrate on the surrounding area. 


11.1. Operating principle 

The Back-up Assistant stores the distance travelled and the steering wheel movements made before 
the vehicle is parked. This is performed automatically under a speed of approximately 35 km/h for the 
last 50 meters covered in the forward direction. 

After the Back-up Assistant is activated, the vehicle assumes lateral guidance for the stored distance 
covered. The LED displays on the multifunction steering wheel light up green in the process. 



5 

i 

CO 


Back-up Assistant (examples of possible applications) 

The driver is relieved of the steering effort and can thus fully concentrate on monitoring the 
surrounding area of the vehicle. 

During the automatic steering wheel movements the driver receives feedback from the LED displays 
on the multifunction steering wheel. 

The driver remains responsible for the longitudinal guidance. The speed of the vehicle may be no 
higher than walking speed, otherwise the Back-up Assistant is deactivated. 

Another prerequisite for using the Back-up Assistant is the consideration of the lane width. This must 
be approximately a minimum of 30 cm wider than the actual vehicle. 



The driver himself remains responsible for accelerating and braking. A change of environment after 
the distance covered is stored, for example due to a changed parking position of a different vehicle, is 
not taken into consideration. The driver is thus responsible for monitoring the vehicle environment and 
must brake or if necessary steer himself accordingly. 


After the activation of the Back-up Assistant in the iDrive menu the driver is shown support notes on 
the Central Information Display (CID). For example, the remaining distance is displayed during the 
automated reversing maneuver.

12. Automatic Lane Change 


The G05 introduces the Automatic Lane Change function to the US market. Automatic Lane Change 
supports the driver when changing lanes, for example when passing on highways. The system offers 
the driver further convenience with this and can contribute to avoiding possible collisions with another 
vehicle travelling in the same direction. 


If the driver has activated the system and the destination lane is free, the vehicle automatically carries 
out a steering wheel movement and returns to lane guidance (Steering Assistant) after the lane change 
is completed. 


The system assists the driver in the speed range from approximately 70 km/h to approximately 
180 km/h. 


12.1. Functional principle 

Automatic Lane Change is activated if the driver operates the turn indicator (“one-touch signalling” 
and holds it for approximately 1 second) with Steering Assistant activated. This signals to the 
system that the driver would like to change to the adjacent lane with system support. 

First the system analyzes whether a danger-free lane change is possible, and also whether sufficient 
room for the maneuver is available. The surroundings are monitored by the side radar sensors and the 
data from the KAFAS camera. The KAFAS camera is principally used for lane detection. 

The radar sensors are not only responsible for the detection of an object, but are also able to take into 
consideration the speed of vehicles detected nearby. 

12.1.1. Monitoring ranges 

The monitoring ranges for the radar sensors are as follows:

12. Automatic Lane Change 

The vehicle performs the lane change automatically if the sensor system does not detect any 
vehicles in the relevant safety zone and if there is sufficient room for maneuvering available. It is of no 
importance whether the vehicle lane change is for passing purposes or whether the driver is simply 
wishing to change lanes. 

The direction of the lane change is determined by the turn indicator which has been previously set. 



G05 Automatic Lane Change 


The driver merely has to monitor the lane change. This does not, however, mean that he is released 
from his duties as a driver. For instance, the driver is also obliged to check whether a lane change is 
permissible at all, and has to take account of passing restrictions, solid lines, etc. Automatic Lane 
Change does not take these circumstances into consideration. 


Once the change to the adjacent lane is complete, the vehicle returns to lane guidance (Steering 
Assistant). 


The lane change maneuver will be aborted if, once it has started, the turn indicator lever is released too 
soon (less than approximately 1 second), a Blind Spot Collision Warning warning is issued or an object 
is detected to the side of the vehicle. If the lane change maneuver is automatically cancelled before the 
vehicle has crossed the lane marker, the vehicle is guided back into the original lane. 



The driver has full responsibility for the lane change maneuver, including checking that the destination 
lane is free. 


The maximum steering torque has been set in such a way that it can always be overruled by the driver 
and therefore steering past the maximum steering torque is possible. This means that the driver has 
the capability at all times to abort the automatic lane change.

A_ 

Automatic Lane Change cannot replace the driver’s personal judgement of the traffic situation. 
Therefore, check the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking around, otherwise there may be 
a risk of an accident as a result of road users or objects which lie outside the detection range of the 
sensors. Approaching vehicles can be detected too late or not at all because of the limits inherent in 
the system. Automatic Lane Change does not release the driver from his own responsibilities.

12. Automatic Lane Change 

12.3. Functional prerequisites 

The following basic prerequisites must be met to use Automatic Lane Change: 

♦ Steering Assistant is active. 

♦ The vehicle is traveling on a divided highway. 

♦ The turn indicator lever is held in the “one-touch signalling position” for approximately 
1 second. 

♦ The driving lane line to be crossed has been detected. 

♦ “Hands-on” (hands on the steering wheel) must be detected at the start of the maneuver. 

♦ Blind Spot Collision Warning is active and not issuing a warning. 

♦ No vehicles have been detected in the maneuvering space to the side of the vehicle. 

♦ No stationary objects (such as roadside structures, posts, etc.) have been detected in the 
maneuvering space to the side of the vehicle. 

♦ The vehicle is travelling at a speed between approximately 70 km/h and approximately 
180 km/h. 


12.4. Deactivation criteria 

Automatic Lane Change is automatically deactivated in the following situations: 

♦ Automatic Lane Change is no longer executed if the trigger conditions are not met within 
approximately 10 seconds from the start of the turn indication. 

♦ Automatic Lane Change will be aborted if, once a lane change maneuver has started, the turn 
indicator lever is released too soon (less than approximately 1 second), a Blind Spot Collision 
Warning is issued or an object is detected to the side of the vehicle. 

♦ Automatic Lane Change is also aborted if the driver steers opposite to the steering torque 
applied by the system. 

♦ If the lane marker on the other side of the destination lane is not detected in sufficient time 
after passing over the lane marking to be crossed.
