G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 


The most versatile range of Driver Assistance Systems ever for a BMW model was launched with the 
introduction of the G12. 

Numerous innovative systems have been introduced and have opened the way for highly automated 
driving. It is planned that the technical prerequisites will have been laid for an “Autobahn pilot” by 2020 
so that we will be able to offer highly automated driving for the first time. 

At present, however, the appropriate legal foundations have not been laid for autonomous driving. 

Drivers are still expected to drive with both hands on the steering wheel, although systems are already 
in place to drive the vehicle autonomously in certain situations. 

The already comprehensive range of Driver Assistance Systems has been expanded again in the G30 
to include revolutionary new systems. Systems such as Intersection Warning are in use. Evasion Aid 
is presented for the first time with the launch of the G30. For even greater convenience, the restart 
time on the Active Cruise Control Stop&Go function has been increased, and the detection of more 
information and the incorporation of further sensors has made more driver-like driving characteristics 
possible. 

A further feature among the camera systems is the Remote 3D View function which makes it possible 
to transmit an image of the parked vehicle to mobile devices. 

The interplay between the varied and intelligent Driver Assistance Systems supports the driver in 
every respect; from making driving more comfortable to providing the reassuring feeling of safety on all 
roads. 

The Driver Assistance Systems help to make the driver's life easier by: 

• Providing the driver with information 

• Prompting the driver with suggestions 

• Automatically intervening in the driving process 

This reference manual contains an overview of all the Driver Assistance Systems used in the G30: 

• Camera-based collision warning 

• Frontal Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation 

• Daytime Pedestrian Protection 

• Lane Departure Warning 

• Blind Spot Detection 

• Side Collision Avoidance 

• Intersection Warning 

• Road Sign Recognition 

• Proactive Driving Assistant 

• Fatigue and Focus Alert 

• Night vision 

• Camera systems 

• Park Distance Control

G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 


• Cross Traffic Alert 

• Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

• Remote Control Parking 

• Speed control 

• Speed limit warning 

• Traffic Jam Assistant 

• Active Lane Keeping Assistant with Side Collision Avoidance 

• Evasion Aid 

Identifying road users driving ahead as well as detecting objects and lane edges are among the most 
important prerequisites for the Driver Assistance Systems. This applies not only for the far range but 
also the close range. 

The optional functions available for the G30 are implemented either as camera-based systems with 
a shared camera and integrated control unit, or using sensors such as ultrasonic or radar sensors. 
Evaluation signals provided by various control units (for example, from the Advanced Crash Safety 
Module (ACSM)) are also taken into consideration. 


1.1. Further information 

The Driver Assistance Systems in the new BMW 5 Series builds on those of the BMW 7 Series G12.

3.1. Functional limitations 

The function of the KAFAS stereo camera and thus the function of the corresponding Driver 
Assistance Systems may be impaired due to the physical limits of the optical systems, for example in 
the following situations: 

• Heavy fog, rain, spray or snow. 

• Strong light in the camera lens. 

• If the field of view of the KAFAS stereo camera or the windscreen is dirty. 

• On tight bends. 

• If boundary lines are missing, worn, poorly visible, converging or diverging, or not clearly 
recognizable, as may be the case when road construction is being performed. 

• If boundary lines are covered by snow, ice, dirt or water. 

• If boundary lines are covered by objects. 

• If driving at close proximity to a vehicle driving ahead. 

• If the windscreen in front of the interior mirror is misted over, soiled or covered by stickers, e.g. 
parking permits, etc. 

• Up to 10 seconds after driving readiness is activated via the start/stop button. 

• During the calibration process for the KAFAS stereo camera immediately after vehicle delivery 
or a camera change.

Due to functional limitations and system restrictions it may transpire that warnings and alerts are not 
issued, are issued too late or are unwarranted. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively 
intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident.

6. Intelligent Safety 

Due to the ever increasing amount of traffic on our roads, Driver Assistance Systems in vehicles 
continue to gain in importance. The systems have different functions: some gather information to help 
the driver in the decision-making process, while others take on the driver's roles in monotonous traffic 
situations or intervene to make corrections. 

The Driver Assistance Systems support the driver on highways, single-lane roads and in urban 
environments. Systems such as the Daytime Pedestrian Protection provide support in urban traffic, for 
instance. Night Vision can assist the driver when driving on single-lane roads with adjacent woodland 
(deer crossings, etc.). The Lane Departure Warning and Blind Spot Detection as well as the Side 
Collision Avoidance provide even more safety in traffic. Accidents can be avoided through automatic 
brake interventions, active steering interventions or a combination of both. 

Once more, new Driver Assistance Systems are being presented with the launch of a new BMW 5 
Series. The Intelligent Safety menu has been adapted to the new systems accordingly. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, the driver has a multitude of individual configurations available in 
the Intelligent Safety menu. For some systems, no configuration options are provided by the operating 
concept. Thus, for example, Evasion Aid can only be deactivated by switching off all Intelligent Safety 
systems (ALL OFF). 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, Intelligent Safety consists of one or several systems, which can 
help to avoid a potential collision. The following systems are offered in the G30: 

• Daytime Pedestrian Protection 

• Night Vision with person and animal recognition 

• Lane Departure Warning 

• Blind Spot Detection 

• Side Collision Avoidance 

• Evasion Aid 

• Frontal Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation 

The Intelligent Safety button, already familiar from other BMW models, enables the Driver Assistance 
Systems to be operated centrally. This means the systems can be switched on or off using a button 
and the submenu can be called up to personalize the settings.

7. Collision Warning 

The camera-based collision warning is part of the Active Driving Assistant optional equipment 
(OE 5AS) in the G30 and is implemented using the KAFAS stereo camera. 

The collision warning in the new BMW 5 Series contains the familiar Frontal Collision Warning with 
City Collision Mitigation and Daytime Pedestrian Protection functions. 

In vehicles with the Active Driving Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT), the cruise control radar 
sensor is also used to control the collision warning.

Detection range of the radar sensor 


Vehicles with the Active Driving Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT) have the Active Cruise 
Control with Stop&Go function integrated as standard. 

The system warns the driver in situations where a collision is imminent. The early warning, a visual 
signal, is issued first to draw the driver's attention to the situation. If the situation becomes more 
critical, an acute early warning in the form of a visual and acoustic signal is issued. The nature of the 
warning is such that the driver can still prevent a collision providing he acts quickly. 

A_ 

The collision warning is dependent on the vehicle's own driving speed. The distance measured for the 
collision warning is significantly lower than the legally required minimum distance. It is therefore the 
responsibility of the driver to adhere to the legal minimum distance.

Explanation 

Early warning: 

• Vehicle symbol lights up red 

• Increase distance and brake if necessary 

Acute warning: 

• Vehicle symbol flashes red and a signal

• Request for intervention by braking and 
evasive action, if required 



Acute warning: 

• Person symbol flashes red and a signal sounds 

• Request for intervention by braking and 
evasive action, if required 


A 

The acute warning does not relieve the driver of his responsibility to adapt the speed and driving style 
to the traffic conditions. 


Additional information regarding the collision warning may be found in the “G12 Driver Assistance 
Systems” reference manual (sections 7.1 and 7.2).

The point at which the early collision warning is issued can be configured in the "Intelligent Safety 
systems" menu on the Central Information Display (CID). 

The acute warning cannot be deactivated separately. The timing of the acute warning also cannot 
be adjusted. If the acute warning is not to be issued, the "collision warning" front protective function 
must be deactivated. The collision warning can be switched off by holding down the Intelligent Safety 
button. 

It is also not possible to configure or deactivate the pedestrian warning separately. The "collision 
warning" front protective function must be also deactivated by holding down the Intelligent Safety 
button in order to deactivate the pedestrian warning function.

7.3. Limits of the system 

A_ 

The collision warning has a limited capacity for detection. 

As a result, incorrect or delayed warnings may occur. It is possible the following vehicles are not 
detected: 

• A slow vehicle when driving off at high speed. 

• Vehicles that suddenly swerve or decelerate rapidly. 

• Vehicles with an unusual rear view or with insufficiently visible rear lights. 

• Partially concealed vehicles. 

• Two-wheeled vehicles travelling ahead.

The function of the KAFAS stereo camera and thus the function of the corresponding Driver 
Assistance Systems may be impaired in the following situations, for example: 

• Heavy fog, rain, spray or snow. 

• Insufficient light. 

• Strong light in the camera lens. 

• If the field of view of the KAFAS stereo camera or the windscreen is dirty. 

• On sharp bends. 

• With pedestrians up to approximately 2.5 ft (80 cm) in height. 

• Up to 10 seconds after engine start via the START-STOP button. 

• During the calibration process for the KAFAS stereo camera immediately after vehicle delivery 
or a camera change. 


A 

Due to functional limitations and system restrictions it may transpire that warnings and alerts are not 
issued, are issued too late or are unwarranted. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively 
intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident.

8. Lane Departure Warning 


The Lane Departure Warning is an element of the Active Driving Assistant, optional equipment (OE 
5AS) and the Active Driving Assistant Plus, optional equipment (OE 5AT). 

The Lane Departure Warning detects lane markings from a speed of approximately 43 mph (70 km/h) 
and warns the driver against unintentionally leaving the lane. 

The information required about usable roadway and lane markings is provided by the KAFAS stereo 
camera. Based on the calculated positions, lane edges and curves in relation to the relative position of 
the driver's vehicle, a corresponding warning is issued. 

If the driver crosses the lane marking unintentionally (without using the turn indicator) or leaves the 
road boundary, he is warned abruptly by the steering wheel vibrating gently and has the opportunity 
to react accordingly. The vibration in the steering wheel can be compared to the vibration effect when 
driving over a profiled road marking. 

In the settings menu the driver can set the desired strength of the abrupt warnings on the steering 
wheel via the Drive.

8.1. Active steering intervention 

In vehicles with the Side Collision Avoidance (included in Active Driving Assistant Plus, optional 
equipment OE 5AT), the driver is assisted by another measure known as "active steering intervention". 

If the driver does not react to the warning issued by the Lane Departure Warning system and crosses 
the lane marking, he is assisted to stay in lane by a brief active steering intervention. 



G30 Lane Departure Warning (active steering intervention) 

The active steering intervention can be felt on the steering wheel, but can be overridden by the driver 
at any time. If the driver does override the intervention, the active steering intervention is cancelled. 

The "steering intervention" for the Lane Departure Warning can be switched on and off via the Drive 
menu in vehicles with the Side Collision Avoidance by making the following selection via the controller: 

• "My Vehicle" 

• "Vehicle settings" 

• "Intelligent Safety"

Steering interventions are not initiated when the trailer socket is in use, such as when a trailer is being 
towed or a bicycle carrier is mounted. 


8.2. Deactivation criteria 

The Lane Departure Warning is available at a speed range from 43-130 mph (70 km/h - 210 km/h). 
A warning is not issued in the following situations: 

• Use of the turn indicator 

• In construction zones 

• Lane is narrower than 8 V 2 ft (2.60 m) 

The warning is cancelled in the following situations: 

• Automatically after approximately 3 seconds 

• As soon as the driver moves back into his own lane 

• The turn indicator is used 

• When sharp braking or steering maneuvers are made and when 
the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) intervenes 


8.3. Limits of the system 

The function of the system may not be available or may only be available to a limited extent in the 
following situations: 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• At sharp bends or on narrow roadways. 

• If boundary lines are covered by snow, ice, dirt or water. 

• If boundary lines are covered by objects. 

• If boundary lines are missing, worn, poorly visible, converging or diverging, or not clearly 

recognizable, such as when driving through construction zones. 


A 

The system does not replace the personal assessment of the road and the traffic situation. The Lane 
Departure Warning is only intended to assist the driver. When active Lane Departure Warnings are 
issued, the steering wheel should not be moved through any unnecessarily heavy-handed actions.

9. Blind Spot Detection 

The Blind Spot Detection system can detect traffic situations that could pose a risk if the driver 
changes lane. These traffic situations include vehicles approaching quickly from behind or vehicles in 
the driver's blind spot. The system operates within a speed range between 12-130 mph (20 - 210 
km/h). 

The Blind Spot Detection function may also be known as “Lane change warning” in technical systems. 



G30 Vehicle detection using radar sensors (Blind Spot Detection) 

The control units (radar sensors) for the Blind Spot Detection (SWW) are located under the rear 
bumper.

The control unit for the Blind Spot Detection (primary) (SWW) is installed on the right and the control 
unit for the Blind Spot Detection (secondary) (SWW2) is installed on the left. 

When a vehicle is detected and the system is activated, the driver is informed of the situation by an 
unobtrusive indicator in the exterior mirror. By having this information before making a lane change 
maneuver, the driver can confidently prepare for the lane change and avoid critical situations from the 
outset.

The Side Collision Avoidance is part of the Active Lane Keeping Assistant with Side Collision 
Avoidance. The Active Lane Keeping Assistant with Side Collision Avoidance is part of the scope 
of supply of the Active Driving Assistant Plus, optional equipment (OE 5AT). The Side Collision 
Avoidance is not available separately. 

The Side Collision Avoidance assists the driver in avoiding a potential side collision. 

Four radar sensors monitor the area next to the vehicle and function regardless of the lighting 
conditions and largely irrespective of the weather conditions. 



G30 Vehicle detection using radar sensors (Side Collision Avoidance) 

If there is a risk of a collision, the corresponding indicator flashes (depending on which side the risk 
relates to, left or right) in the exterior mirror with high intensity and the steering wheel starts to vibrate.

10. Side Collision Avoidance 


An active steering intervention is then initiated, which assists the driver in moving his vehicle back to a 
safe area within his own lane. 



G30 Side Collision Avoidance with active steering intervention in the event of a potential side collision 

The steering intervention is initiated within a speed range of between 43 and 130 mph (70 km/h and 
210 km/h). 

The active steering intervention can be felt on the steering wheel, but can be manually overridden by 
the driver at any time.

10. Side Collision Avoidance 


Two additional radar sensors are used for the front Side Collision Avoidance. 



G30 Side Collision Avoidance (radar sensors) 

Functional prerequisites 

A prerequisite for the activation of the Side Collision Avoidance with steering intervention is that the 
lane markings must be detected by the KAFAS stereo camera. 

If the lane markings are not detected or if the driver is driving within the speed range of 18 to 43 mph 
(30 to 70 km/h), only the reduced Side Collision Avoidance is active. The warning functions in the form 
of the flashing indicator in the exterior mirror and the vibration of the steering wheel continue to be 
implemented. 

With the reduced Side Collision Avoidance there is no active lateral guidance of the vehicle. In this 
case the driver is only warned by a single steering wheel pulse on the opposite side of the wheel to the 
danger. 

The Side Collision Avoidance can be switched on and off via the iDrive menu by making the following 
selection via the controller: 

• "My Vehicle" 

• "Vehicle settings" 

• "Intelligent Safety" 

• "Side Collision Avoidance" 

The configuration menu can be accessed quickly by pressing the Intelligent Safety button.

11. Intersection Warning 

Intersections are some of the most likely points for accidents in urban traffic. Statistics tell us that 
approximately one accident in three, with injury to persons, occurs at an intersection. Accidents here 
can largely be attributed to distraction or poor estimation by the drivers. 

The Intersection Warning is installed for the first time in the G30 and can make a major contribution to 
safety. 

The driver is warned both visually and audibly in the event of a risk of a collision with crossing traffic. 
This can significantly reduce the likelihood of an accident or even the severity of an accident at 
intersections. 

Intersection Warning is an integral part of the Active Driving Assistant Plus, optional equipment 
(OE 5AT). 


11.1. Functional principle 

Intersection Warning is able to detect an impending collision with crossing traffic in good time and so 
such collisions can possibly be prevented by this. 

The KAFAS stereo camera and the front radar sensor (ACC radar sensor) monitor the traffic 
conditions. The information obtained from these sources forms the basis for the system. The sensors 
detect the distance from other traffic and its speed and direction of movement. The speed of the car is 
also determined. 



G30 Intersection Warning 


34 



G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

11. Intersection Warning 

11.1.1. Warning 

A warning is issued if a risk of a collision (approximately 1 second before the collision) with crossing 
traffic is detected and its avoidance by the driver or the crossing traffic is only now possible through an 
uncomfortable maneuver. 

A 

The warning is, however, only issued if the crossing traffic is travelling more slowly than the vehicle. 


So if the crossing vehicle is travelling faster than the car, no warning would be issued, as the crossing 
vehicle would be outside the detection range of the sensor system until shortly before the collision. 

Warning range 

The graphic below shows the danger area which is decisive for the Intersection Warning: 



Index 

Explanation

4 

Vehicle outside the danger area 


If the detection system identifies a hazardous situation, it prompts the driver into emergency braking 
by a visual and an audible warning. 

At the same time, the brake system is prefilled. However, there is no automatically triggered brake 
intervention by the system. It is rather that the driver is prompted to act quickly and to apply the brakes 
himself. There may be automatic brake-servo assistance during the emergency braking, as necessary. 
The brake pressure is regulated as needed for effective panic braking.

The Intersection Warning is active in the speed range from approximately 9 mph (15 km/h) to 
approximately 40 mph (65 km/h). 


The Intersection Warning is also switched off by selecting ALL OFF. There is no separate deactivation 
or configuration option in the Drive menu for the Intersection Warning. 


A_ 

The Intersection Warning system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly 
judging the visibility and traffic situation. The driver's driving style should be adapted to the traffic 
conditions. The driver should check the traffic conditions, and react accordingly if required. 


36 











G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

11. Intersection Warning 

11.2. Limits of the system 

The function of the Intersection Warning may be restricted because of system limits or unfavorable 
conditions in the following situations, for example: 

• If there are other objects in the field of view of the sensors that are concealing the cross traffic. 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• If the front bumper is dirty or iced up. 

• If stickers have been attached near the radar sensors on the bumper. 

• If the speed of the approaching vehicle is very high. 

• If crossing objects are moving very slowly. 

• If it is almost impossible to detect the crossing traffic because of the way the road runs or 
topographical conditions, for example in tight bends, building complexes in the way etc. 


A_ 

The system does not replace the personal assessment of the road and the traffic situation. 

The Intersection Warning is only intended to assist the driver. There can be functional limitations 
because of system restrictions or unfavorable topographical conditions.

selection via the controller: 

• "My Vehicle" 

• "iDrive settings" 

• "Displays" 

• "Instrument panel" 

• Apply desired settings 


38 









G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

12. Road Sign Recognition 

12.2. Limits of the system 

Road signs for top speed limitations that do not comply with the legal standard, particularly those 
without circular frames, are not always detected. The same also applies for road signs which are fully 
or partially covered by labels, dirt or vegetation. Long distances to the road sign, high driving speeds 
and poor weather conditions, particularly at night, make it more difficult for the system to recognize 
road signs reliably. To ensure the current top speed limitations are displayed as accurately as possible, 
the data of the navigation road map should be up-to-date. 

The functionality of the Road Sign Recognition may be impaired in the following situations and this 
may lead to incorrect information being displayed: 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• If signs are covered by objects. 

• If driving at close proximity to a vehicle driving ahead. 

• Strong light in the camera lens. 

• If the windscreen in front of the interior mirror is misted over, soiled or covered by stickers, etc. 

• As a result of incorrect detection by the camera. 

• If the top speed limitations stored in the navigation system are incorrect. 

• In areas not covered by the navigation system. 

• In the event of deviations from the navigation, e.g. due to modified road layouts. 

• When overtaking buses or trucks with speed limit stickers. 

• If road signs do not correspond to the standard. 

• When calibrating the camera immediately after vehicle delivery. 


A 

The system does not replace the personal assessment of the traffic situation. Due to system 
restrictions and functional limitations, it may transpire that warnings and alerts are not issued, are 
issued too late or are unwarranted. The Road Sign Recognition supports the driver and does not 
replace the human eye.

14. Fatigue and Focus Alert 

The Fatigue and Focus Alert helps to avoid accidents caused by tiredness on long, monotonous 
journeys. It is part of the Active Protection equipment (OE 5AL) included in the basic equipment. 

A change in the driver's driving behavior is perceived by the Fatigue and Focus Alert. In the event 
of increasing inattentiveness or if the driver is tired, the Fatigue and Focus Alert shows a display 
recommending that the driver take a break as a Check Control message in the Central Information 
Display (CID). 

The Fatigue and Focus Alert is automatically active after each engine start from a speed of roughly 
43 mph (70 km/h).

• If the clock is set incorrectly. 

• If the speed is predominantly below approximately 43 mph (70 km/h). 

• If the driver adopts a sporty driving style, for example rapid acceleration or fast cornering. 

• In active driving situations, for example frequent lane changes. 

• Poor road condition. 

• Strong crosswind.

15. Night Vision 

In the G30, the Night Vision system is available in the form of BMW Night Vision with person and 
animal detection, optional equipment (OE 6UK). 

Night Vision detects people and animals in optimum conditions at night up to a distance of 
approximately 330 ft (100 m) away and therefore assists the driver, especially on dark and difficult 
stretches of road, such as when driving on single-lane roads with adjacent woods. 

In potentially dangerous situations, the system warns the driver of people and animals on the road. 

The Night Vision camera integrated in the BMW radiator grille records the area in front of the vehicle 
and sends the data to the Night Vision Electronics (NVE).

Warning levels 

Night Vision detects people and determines their position and distance from the vehicle. Taking into 
account the driving speed and steering angle, the system calculates whether there is a potential risk 
and displays a warning sign (early warning) in the instrument cluster and in the Head-Up Display, if 
present. 

In critical situations a warning signal also sounds (acute warning). The warning threshold values are 
also dependent on whether the person or the animal is moving or standing still.

• On steep summits or dips and tight bends. 

• If the camera is dirty or the protective screen is damaged. 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• If the outside temperatures are very high. 

The person and animal recognition may also be impaired or may not issue the usual warnings. 

This can occur in the following cases: 

• If the person or animal is fully or partially hidden, particularly the head. 

• If the person is not in an upright position, e.g. if they are lying down. 

• If a bike has non-conventional wheels, e.g. recumbent bicycle. 

• If the system has been affected mechanically, e.g. after an accident. 

In certain cases small animals may be entirely visible on the Central Information Display, but may 
not be identified by the object detection. As a consequence, a warning is also not issued.

16. Cameras 


The camera systems provide support for parking, maneuvering and for complex exits and 
intersections. 

The range of camera systems offered has changed completely with the G30. With the exception of the 
rear view camera, the systems are no longer available as individual items of optional equipment. 

The new range strategy now looks like this: 

• The rear view camera is available separately as the rear view camera, optional equipment 
(OE 3AG). 

• Surround View is offered in conjunction with the Parking Assistant Plus, optional equipment 
(OE 5DN). The Surround View function with Top View, Panorama View and 3D View provides 
360° visibility around the vehicle. 

• The Remote 3D view (Remote 360°) is presented for the first time in conjunction with the 
Parking Assistant Plus, optional equipment (OE 5DN). This function allows the customer to 
display images of his parked vehicle on a mobile device (such as a smartphone). 


16.1. Surround View 

Surround View shows the vehicle surroundings and displays them in TOP View and 3D View on the 
Central Information Display. 

The system comprises the front camera, the two cameras integrated in the exterior mirrors, the rear 
view camera (RFK) and the Top Rear Side View Camera (TRSVC) control unit. The TRSVC may be 
referred to as ICAM2 in technical systems. 

The images from the four cameras are combined into a panoramic view around the vehicle from 
different angles using 3D computer graphics. 

The driver can choose from preset views or can freely select the view (for example, car wash 
entrances). 

In addition, assistance functions such as guidance lines can be shown on the Central Information 
Display. 

The following camera angles can be displayed: 

• Automatic camera angle 

• Side view 

• Front camera 

• Panorama view 

• Rear view camera 

• Moving camera angle

G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

16. Cameras 

16.1.1. Automatic camera angle 

The system automatically shows the most appropriate camera angle depending on the driving 
situation, thus providing the driver with optimum assistance when parking and maneuvering. The 
automatic camera angle shows a steering-dependent view and takes into account the respective 
direction of travel and the distance information from the Park Distance Control (PDC). 

As soon as obstacles are detected, the view changes to a fixed display of the area in front of or behind 
the vehicle, or changes to the corresponding side view if required. 


16.1.2. Side view 

This view helps the driver to position the vehicle next to the curb or other obstacles at the side 
of the vehicle by displaying the side surroundings. The side view is from the rear to the front and 
automatically focuses on potential obstacles if there is a collision risk. 

Both the left and right sides of the vehicle are recorded. 

16.1.3. Front camera 

The front camera supports the driver when parking and maneuvering. The area in front of the vehicle 
is recorded by the front camera and shown on the Central Information Display. The front camera view 
cannot be selected separately. The driver must select the "Auto" camera angle to view it or if desired, 
switch on the "Panorama View" function. 


16.1.4. Panorama View 

Panorama View enables the driver to see the cross traffic at blind exits and intersections before 
proceeding and provides the driver with optimum assistance in this situation. Road users that are 
hidden by obstacles to the side of the vehicle are sometimes only seen by the driver very late or not at 
all. To improve the view, the front and rearview cameras record the lateral roadway area. Depending on 
which drive position is engaged, the front or rearview camera can be activated.

16.3.2. Side protection 

The side protection warns against obstacles at the side of the vehicle and thus supports the driver 
when parking and maneuvering. 

To protect the sides of the vehicle from collisions with obstacles, additional obstacle markings are 
shown to the side of the vehicle on the Central Information Display, if necessary.

16.3.3. Door opening angle 

When the vehicle is stopped and the selector lever position "P" is engaged, the maximum opening 
angle of the doors is displayed on the Central Information Display. 

If there is an obstacle near the door and it is detected by the side protection, this is marked on the 
Central Information Display. The obstacle marking display only points out objects in the area of 
the door. It is not possible for a view from the camera systems to be displayed, as the door area is 
simulated. Therefore, the driver is only informed that there is an object at the side of the vehicle; it is 
not certain that the door will definitely collide with the identified object. The driver must judge this for 
himself. 



G30 Door opening angle view on the CID 


The "Parking assistance lines" and "Obstacle marking" features already used in other BMW models 
can also be activated and deactivated via the iDrive in the toolbar under the relevant menu items. 

A __ 

The camera systems do not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic 
situation. There is still a risk of an accident. The driver's driving style should be adapted to the traffic 
conditions. The driver should check the traffic conditions and the vehicle's surroundings by looking 
around and react accordingly if required. 


16.4. Remote 3D View 

The Remote 3D View (Remote 360°) is provided for the first time on the G30. This function allows the 
customer to display images of his parked vehicle on a mobile device (such as a smartphone). 

The user can send a remote request to the parked vehicle through his device. The vehicle takes 
images of its surroundings and sends these to the device where an app generates a 3D view. 

The view can be adjusted by gesture, as in the vehicle. 

The customer thus has the capability of viewing his vehicle's surroundings at any time. 

Examples: 

• What does it look like around my vehicle? 

• Who or what is near my vehicle? 

Remote 3D View is part of the Parking Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5DN). 


60 




G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

16. Cameras 


16.4.1. Functional principle 

Surround View is a prerequisite for Remote 3D View (Remote 360°) as it includes the Top View 3D 
function. This means that the already familiar cameras are used. 

The function is sold via the Remote Services standard equipment (6AP). 

The Remote Services, standard equipment (OE 6AP), contains a number of functions that are active 
for the lifetime of the vehicle. Remote 3D View is, however, an exception. The function is active for 
2 years following activation. The service expires after 2 years. In this event, the customer is notified by 
text and email 2 weeks before expiry of the Remote 3D View service. 

When the service has expired, the customer has the option of activating or purchasing the function for 
a further two years through the ConnectedDrive Shop. Availability of the function can be extended as 
many times as desired via the ConnectedDrive Shop. 


Application: 

The customer should like to have an image of the area around his parked vehicle. 



G30 Remote 3D View 




1 He sends a request to the BMW back end via the BMW Connected App (Remote 3D View) on his 
smartphone. 

2 Following verification of the data, the BMW back end passes the request on to the appropriate 
vehicle. The vehicle then takes four separate Surround View images using the external 
cameras. These are then sent in the Top Rear Side View Camera control unit to the Telematic 
Communication Box (TCB) and temporarily buffered.

Availability 

The system includes a function detecting any border crossing or the country in which the vehicle is 
located in order to allow a country-specific release and configuration of the Remote 3D View function 
while at the same time taking account of local laws which might possibly prohibit the use of this 
function. The function may be automatically deactivated, as appropriate. 

The driver also has the possibility of activating or deactivating the function itself via the Drive (if the 
function is supported in the country in which the vehicle is located). 

The new status is sent to the BMW back end after every change to the setting (to Remote 3D View 
deactivated, for example). The BMW back end stores the status permanently and releases or inhibits 
the function calls as appropriate on the basis of this.

17. Park Distance Control 


The Park Distance Control (PDC), optional equipment (OE 508), assists the driver when maneuvering 
in and out of a parking space. The current distance from an obstruction is indicated by acoustic signals 
and on a visual display.

Vehicles that do not have the Parking Maneuvering Assistant but do have the Park Distance Control 
have a separate control unit, which is recognized as the PMA control unit by diagnosis and is also 
referred to by this name in the bus diagram. In other words, there is no longer a difference in the 
naming of the PDC and PMA control unit (there are however differences in the hardware design 
between the control units and the software is adapted to the equipment specification).

17.2. Auto PDC 

On the G30, Auto PDC is activated automatically if the vehicle is approaching an object at a speed 
below approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) and the object is located in a collision-critical area. The Auto PDC 
function is available for both the front and rear of the vehicle. 

The automatic switch-on function when obstacles are detected can be switched on and off via iDrive. 

Further information about Auto PDC may be found in the “G12 Driver Assistance Systems” reference 
manual (section 16.2).

17.3. Active Park Distance Control 

In G30 vehicles with the Parking Assistant, optional equipment (OE 5DM), or Parking Assistant Plus, 
(OE 5DN) optional equipment, the Park Distance Control function has been extended to include 
the Active Park Distance Control function. This automatically brakes the vehicle to a stop when it 
is travelling at walking speed (< approximately 4 mph (6 km/h)) if an object is detected behind the 
vehicle. 

The Active Park Distance Control function can be switched on and off via iDrive. 

A_ 

The system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic 
situation. The driver should check the traffic conditions and the vehicle's surroundings by looking 
around and react accordingly if required. 


Further information about the Active Park Distance Control function may be found in the “G12 Driver 
Assistance Systems” reference manual (section 16.3). 


17.4. Side protection 

The side protection warns against obstacles at the side of the vehicle and thus supports the driver 
when parking and maneuvering. 



G30 Side protection 


Vehicles with the Parking Assistant, optional equipment (OE 5DM), have side protection. 

Obstacles detected by the four side ultrasonic sensors integrated in the bumpers can be displayed by 
the Park Distance Control system.

17.4.1. Functional principle 

Four side ultrasonic sensors, two integrated in the front bumper and two integrated in the rear bumper, 
measure the distance to an obstruction. Obstructions detected by the sensors are tracked along the 
side of the vehicle as it moves. They are shown on the Central Information Display and, in situations 
where a collision is imminent, an acoustic warning also sounds. 



G30 Side protection view on the CID 


Obstructions approaching the stationary vehicle are not taken into account, as in this case the system 
cannot evaluate the situation unequivocally. The prerequisite for identifying obstructions is that the 
(driver's) vehicle is moving. 


The distance markings shown on the Central Information Display are displayed for approximately 
13 seconds once the vehicle has stopped. The markings are only shown again once the vehicle starts 
moving.

17.5. Operation 

The Park Distance Control system is enabled in the following situations: 

• If drive position R reverse gear is engaged when driving readiness is switched on. 

• If the parking assistance button in the switch block next to the controller is pressed 
when driving readiness is switched on. 

• Auto PDC is activated and all conditions for automatic activation are met.

Further information about the operating concept for Auto PDC, the Active Park Distance Control 
function and acoustic signal output may be found in the “G12 Driver Assistance Systems” reference 
manual (section 16.5.1-16.5.3). 


17.6. Deactivation criteria 

Similar to other BMW models, the deactivation is distance/speed-based. The switch-off is effected 
after a journey of approximately 164 ft (50 m) or at a speed over 6 mph (10 km/h). 

If a fault develops, a Check Control message "PDC has malfunctioned. Have system checked." is 
displayed in the Central Information Display (CID). In addition, the detection range of the sensors is 
shown shaded in the Central Information Display (CID). 


72 






G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

17. Park Distance Control 

17.7. Limits of the system 

Due to the physical limits during the ultrasonic measurement, obstructions may not be detected by the 
Park Distance Control system. Several examples of this are shown below: 

• If the objects are thin or wedge-shaped. 

• When the objects are low. 

• When objects that, due to their shape, have corners and sharp edges. 

• With snow. 

• If the objects have a porous surface. 

A warning may also be displayed although there is no obstruction in the detection range. This may be 
the case in the following situations: 

• When it is raining heavily. 

• If the sensors are heavily soiled or iced over. 

• If the sensors are covered with snow. 

• If the street surface is rough. 

• If there are bumps, e.g. speed bumps. 

• In large right-angled buildings with smooth walls, e.g. underground car parks. 

• Due to heavy exhaust gas fumes. 

• Due to other ultrasound sources. 

To ensure the ultrasonic sensors remain fully operational, they must be kept clean and free of ice. 

When cleaning the sensors using a high pressure cleaner, avoid direct and sustained contact with a 
high-pressure water jet. Furthermore, when using high pressure cleaners, a distance of at least 1 ft 
(30 cm) from the sensors must be maintained. 

A_ 

The Park Distance Control cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the traffic situation. Also 
check the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking around, otherwise there may be a risk of an 
accident as a result of road users or objects which lie outside the detection range of the Park Distance 
Control. Loud sound sources outside and inside the vehicle could drown out the PDC signal. 


73 






G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

18. Cross Traffic Alert 


The Cross Traffic Alert was used for the first time in the G12. This warning assists the driver when 
maneuvering out of a parking space and in other everyday situations where it is difficult to see the 
traffic, such as at blind entrances and exits. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, the Cross Traffic Alert is available in the G30 for rear or also for 
the front. 

The system can detect objects that are approaching the vehicle from the side, either from the front or 
rear (depending on the vehicle equipment). The driver is made aware or, if necessary, warned of cross 
traffic by the Cross Traffic Alert when maneuvering out of a parking space or entering the cross traffic. 


18.1. Functional principle 

If a moving object is detected, which based on the current speed would be in the area in front of or 
behind the vehicle in approximately the next two seconds, a visual and acoustic warning is issued. 

When a Cross Traffic Alert Rear is issued, the LED in the mirror glass is also switched on. The Blind 
Spot Detection signal unit is used as an indicator. The indicator is switched on in either the left or right 
mirror depending on the direction from which the object is approaching the vehicle. 

The Cross Traffic Alert works up to a speed of approximately 4 mph (7 km/h). Another prerequisite of 
the function is that the side radar sensors are able to detect the road or approaching object. The radar 
sensors can detect objects up to a maximum of 262 ft (80 m) away from the vehicle.

18. Cross Traffic Alert 

18.2. Cross Traffic Alert Rear 

The Cross Traffic Alert Rear assists the driver when reversing out of a parking space and warns of 
potential collisions with cross traffic in traffic situations where it is difficult to see obstructions. 

The Cross Traffic Alert Rear is included in the Active Driving Assistant, optional equipment (OE 5AS), 
scope of supply. 

The warning is displayed in the Park Distance Control image on the Central Information Display. 

In conjunction with the rear view camera, optional equipment (OE 3AG), the Cross Traffic Alert Rear 
will be extended to include an additional display on the Central Information Display. The warning will be 
shown in the form of a red bar in the camera's video screen. 

The Cross Traffic Alert Rear is enabled if the driver engages the "R" drive position or the Park Distance 
Control is active. 

In vehicles with the Parking Assistant Plus, optional equipment (OE 5DN), the Cross Traffic Alert Rear 
is also enabled if Panorama View has been activated. 

The Cross Traffic Alert Rear is available at speeds up to approximately 4 mph (7 km/h). 


18.3. Cross Traffic Alert Front 

The Cross Traffic Alert Front assists the driver when entering the cross traffic from exits and blind 
intersections. 

The Cross Traffic Alert Front is included in the Active Driving Assistant Plus, optional equipment (OE 
5AT), scope of supply. If the Cross Traffic Alert for the front of the vehicle is installed, the rear version is 
activated automatically. 

The warning is displayed in the Park Distance Control image on the Central Information Display. 

The Cross Traffic Alert Front is enabled if the Park Distance Control is active and the speed of the 
vehicle does not exceed approximately 4 mph (7 km/h). 

In vehicles with the Parking Assistant Plus, optional equipment (OE 5DN), the Cross Traffic Alert Front 
is also enabled if Panorama View has been activated. 

Like the Cross Traffic Alert Rear, the Cross Traffic Alert Front function is available at speeds up to 
approximately 4 mph (7 km/h).

the size of a gap between cars and decides, based on the result, whether the gap is large enough to 
accommodate the vehicle. It also relieves the driver of the task of maneuvering into the space. 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (OE 5DP) is no longer available as an individual item of optional 
equipment. 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant is included in the Parking Assistant, optional equipment 
(OE 5DM), in the G30. 

Parking Assistant (OE 5DM) is available only in conjunction with the automatically dipping exterior 
mirror, optional equipment (OE 4T8). 


19.1. Parallel parking/perpendicular parking 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant function facilitates maneuvering into parking spaces that are 
parallel (parallel parking) and perpendicular (bay parking) to the roadway.

19.4. Control unit 

In vehicles with the Parking Maneuvering Assistant, both the Park Distance Control and Parking 
Maneuvering Assistant functions are provided by the PMA control unit. 



G30 Control unit for Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) 


19.5. Functional principle 

The system measures potential parking spaces when driving past at a speed below approximately 
22 mph (35 km/h) even without the system having been activated. 

The parking spaces are measured by two additional ultrasonic sensors, which are integrated into 
the front wheel arch. Two additional ultrasonic sensors are installed in the rear bumper in the G30 to 
precisely detect the size of a perpendicular parking space during the parking maneuver. The additional 
ultrasonic sensors measure the distance to detected objects. 

The four sensors are connected to the Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) control unit, which also 
incorporates the Park Distance Control function. The function of the four ultrasonic sensors is similar 
to that of the Park Distance Control (PDC). Ultrasonic pulses are sent and echo impulses are received. 

If a parking space of a sufficient length and width is found and the system is activated, the driver is 
shown the space on the Central Information Display. 

When searching for a parking space and when parking, all relevant information is presented to the 
driver in an integrated display; from the parking space itself to the status of the parking assistant and 
corresponding handling instructions to distances from other objects. 

The driver is still responsible for monitoring the vehicle environment and can intervene in the 
automatic parking maneuver at any time if required due to the vehicle environment. 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) takes over complete control of the vehicle including 
steering, braking and gear selection. 


86 






G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

19. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

19.5.1. Personal responsibility 

• Directly monitor gaps and the parking procedure and intervene if necessary, as otherwise 
there is a risk of accidents. 

• If a parking space that has already been measured changes, the system does not take this into 
account. 

• The system does not take loads that project above the vehicle into account during parking. 

• The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) may steer the vehicle over or up onto curbs. You 
should therefore use the facility for active intervention at any time with caution as you may 
otherwise damage wheels and tires or the vehicle itself. 

A 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility during 
parking. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is 
a risk of an accident. 


19.6. Functional prerequisites 

To use the Parking Maneuvering Assistant function, the following basic prerequisites must be met: 

• The doors must be closed 

• The trunk lid must be closed 

• The driver's seat belt must be fastened 

• The parking brake must be released 


87 




G30 Driver Assistance Systems

19.6.1. Measuring parking spaces 

Parking spaces are measured while driving. The following parameters apply: 

• Driving forwards straight-ahead up to approximately 22 mph (35 km/h) 

• Maximum distance to the row of parked vehicles: 5 ft (1.5 m) 

Detecting the curb 

If a curb is detected within the range of the ultrasonic sensor while the system is searching for a 
parking space, the parking space is, for the most part, a space that is parallel to the road. 

In the case of parking spaces that are perpendicular to the roadway, the curb is usually outside the 
detection range of the ultrasonic sensors (range approximately 14 ft (4.2 m)).

19.7. Operation 

There are two ways to activate the Parking Maneuvering Assistant function: 

• Activation via parking assistance button 

• Activation by "Engaging reverse gear" followed by "Drive controller operation" 

Activation via parking assistance button 

When the PMA is activated via the parking assistance button in the center console, the parking 
assistance menu in the Central Information Display (CID) is displayed. As soon as a parking space is 
found, the driver receives handling instructions that guide him though the parking procedure with the 
support of the system.

When reverse gear is engaged, the Parking Maneuvering Assistant menu is displayed on the 
Central Information Display accompanied by the status of the parking space search. The Parking 
Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) is, however, not yet activated. This is indicated to the driver by the 
Parking Maneuvering Assistant symbol in the toolbar of the Central Information Display. In order to 
park supported by the system, the parking operation must be activated via the controller by selecting 
the corresponding symbol in the symbol bar at the Central Information Display (CID). 


89 






G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

19. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

19.7.1. Park procedure 

As soon as a parking space is found, the driver is instructed to stop the vehicle and confirm the parking 
space by using the turn indicator corresponding to the parking direction. During the entire parking 
procedure, the driver receives further instructions that guide him though the entire parking procedure 
with the support of the system. 

The driver is prompted to take his hands from the steering wheel during automatic parking and hold 
down the parking assistance button until the parking procedure is complete. 

19.7.2. Deactivation criteria 

Manual deactivation criteria 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) can be deactivated at any time, if necessary, by the driver 
via the controller by selecting the corresponding symbol in the symbol bar on the Central Information 
Display (CID). Another way to deactivate the Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) is to release the 
parking assistance button in the switch block next to the iDrive controller. 

If a fault develops, a Check Control message "The PDC has malfunctioned. Have system checked." is 
displayed in the Central Information Display (CID). 

Automatic deactivation criteria 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) is switched off automatically when the following events 
occur: 


• The parking assistance button is released. 

• The driver holds on to the steering wheel or steers himself. 

• A gear is selected that does not correspond to the instruction on the control display. 

• When accelerating. 

• The parking brake is secured. 

• The turn indicator opposite the required parking side is switched on. 

• At speeds above approximately 6 mph (10 km/h). 

• Possibly if the roadway is covered with snow or is slippery. 

• The trunk lid is open. 

• Possibly if the objects are difficult to overcome, e.g. curbs. 

• If obstructions suddenly appear. 

• A maximum number of parking maneuvers or the parking duration has been exceeded. 


90 




G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

19. Parking Maneuvering Assistant 

19.8. Limits of the system 

The detection of objects can test the ultrasonic measurement system to its limits. Several examples 
of this are shown below: 

• With trailer towbars and couplings. 

• If the objects are thin or wedge-shaped. 

• If the objects are projecting and elevated, e.g. wall projections or loads. 

• If the objects have corners and sharp edges. 

• If the objects have fine surfaces or structures, e.g. fences. 

Low objects that are already displayed, e.g. curbs, may fall within the blind spot of the sensors before 
or after a continuous alarm sounds. It would not be possible to detect objects that are higher up and 
projecting, e.g. wall projections. Parking spaces may be detected although these are not suitable. 

There may be other functional limitations in the following situations, for example: 

• If the sensors are soiled or iced up. 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• On uneven surfaces, e.g. gravel roads. 

• On slippery surfaces. 

• On steep inclines or downhill gradients. 

• If leaves have gathered or snow has piled up in the parking space. 

To ensure the ultrasonic sensors remain fully operational, they must be kept clean and free of ice. 

When cleaning the sensors using a high pressure cleaner, avoid direct and sustained contact with a 
high-pressure water jet. Furthermore, when using high pressure cleaners, a distance of at least 1 ft 
(30 cm) from the sensors must be maintained. 

A_ _ _ 

The Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the 
traffic situation. Also check the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking around, otherwise there 
may be a risk of an accident as a result of road users or objects which lie outside the detection range of 
the Park Distance Control. Loud sound sources outside and inside the vehicle may mask the acoustic 
signals of the Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) or the Park Distance Control (PDC). 


91 






G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

20. Remote Control Parking 

The Remote Control Parking assistant became available for the first time in the G12. This assistance 
system enables the vehicle to be maneuvered in and out of a parking space remotely using the 
BMW display key. The system assists the driver to park in tight parking bays or enclosed spaces (such 
as garages or in multi-story car parks), where it is difficult for the driver to get in and out of the vehicle. 



G30 Remote Control Parking 


Automatic parking in and reversing out of bay parking spaces is possible by activating the "remote- 
controlled parking" function on the display key. 

The Remote Control Parking, optional equipment (OE 5DV), is only available for certain models and 
national-market versions. In addition, the assistance system can only be ordered in conjunction with 
the following equipment: 

• Steptronic sport transmission (OE 2TB) 

• Comfort Access (OE 322) 

• BMW display key (OE 3DS) 

• Parking Assistant Plus (OE 5DN) 

• Professional navigation system (OE 609) 

The entire parking procedure is monitored by the Park Distance Control and Parking Maneuvering 
Assistant ultrasonic sensors and the Surround View cameras within their system limits. The driver is 
outside the vehicle while it is being parked. He must, however, check the situation around the vehicle 
by looking around and can cancel the parking procedure at any time using the BMW display key. If the 
driver leaves the operating range, the vehicle stops automatically.

20.1. Operation 

The touch screen display and Remote Control Parking button on the BMW display key are used to 
operate the Remote Control Parking function. This makes the function intuitive to use and provides the 
driver with messages on the action required to operate the function and system limits. 

The remote-controlled parking button must be pressed and held throughout the entire parking 
procedure, otherwise parking will not start or the vehicle will initiate emergency braking if the button 
is released (electromechanical parking brake subsequently applied). If the data transfer between the 
vehicle and BMW display key is interrupted, the vehicle is also decelerated to a standstill, as the data 
can only be transmitted in the vicinity of the vehicle. 

If objects are detected, the system brakes the vehicle to a stop and prevents it from rolling away 
(activates the service brake and engages selector position "P"). A corresponding notification is shown 
to the driver in the BMW display key. 

A_ 

The braking process because of a detected obstacle is initiated only if this obstacle is permanently 
detected by the ultrasonic sensors. Objects that are, for example, too flat or are outside the detection 
range of the ultrasonic sensors cannot be detected. If the driver is not paying attention, there is a risk 
of an accident or danger of damage. 


93 















G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

20. Remote Control Parking 

The function can continue within 30 seconds if the detected object has been removed. If this time 
period expires, Remote Control Parking switches off the engine and applies the electric parking brake. 
The parking procedure can be continued by activating the system again. 

The driver must meet the following basic prerequisites before the Remote Control Parking function 
can be used: 

• Position the vehicle facing forwards and as centrally and straight as possible in front of the 
parking space (maximum 3° turn angle and 4 in (10 cm) offset to the center of the parking 
space are compensated for by small steering adjustments). 

• The vehicle should be no more than approximately 6 V 2 ft (2 m) away from the parking space. 

• Apply the electromechanical parking brake to secure the vehicle against rolling away. 

• Switch off driving readiness with the start/stop button. 

The graphic below shows an overview of activation of the Remote Control Parking function and its 
operating logic.

messages, giving him direct feedback and information on operating the Remote Control Parking 
function. 

A 

The system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic 
and parking situation. Due to the limits of the system, it cannot automatically react adequately in all 
situations. There is a risk of an accident or danger of material damage. The driver should check the 
traffic conditions and parking situation, and react accordingly if required.

Unauthorized persons, e.g. children, can set the vehicle in motion using the BMW display key, without 
anyone being in the vehicle. There is still a risk of an accident. Protect the BMW display key from 
unauthorized use. 


20.1.1. Cut-off events 

Cut-off events include: 

• Opening the doors, hood or trunk lid. 

• Pressing the brake or accelerator pedal (carried out by a person 
inside the vehicle). 

• Steering interventions. 

• Operating the electric parking brake or gear selector switch (carried out by a 
person inside the vehicle). 

• Exceeding the maximum movement range. 

• Selecting another function using the BMW display key. 

• System fault. 

• Failure or contamination of the ultrasonic sensors. 

• State of charge of the BMW display key battery too low (remote-controlled 
parking not possible below approximately 50% absolute state of charge). 

• Releasing the Remote Control Parking button.

G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

21. Cruise Control 

21.1. Introduction 

Two cruise control functions can be used in the G30. The cruise control with braking function, 
Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC), is part of the standard equipment. 

ACC Stop&Go can be obtained if the customer opts for the Active Driving Assistant Plus, optional 
equipment (OE 5AT), as it is contained in this equipment package. 

A 

The cruise control systems support the driver with adapting the speed, distance and driving style to 
the traffic conditions, but do not relieve him of his responsibility. The driver must actively intervene, 
e.g. by braking, steering or taking evasive action, as otherwise there is a risk of an accident. 


21.2. Cruise control with braking function 

The cruise control with braking function is included as part of the G30's standard equipment. The 
system is also known as "Dynamic Cruise Control" (DCC). Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) supports 
the driver on roads with less traffic by keeping the speed constant irrespective of rolling resistances 
(incline, downhill driving and vehicle load). In spite of the support, the driver remains responsible for 
control of the vehicle. It is possible to override the DCC function at any time by braking or accelerating 
the vehicle. 


21.2.1. Operation 

The driver has the option of adjusting the set speed in small or large increments, which is then set 
and maintained by the system by controlling the drive and brakes. It can be changed using the left- 
hand switch block on the multifunction steering wheel (MFL). The speed is increased or reduced 
by 1 mph by tapping the rocker switch. Each time the rocker button is pressed beyond the pressure 
point, the speed increases or reduces by 5 mph. The DCC steadily maintains a selected speed from 
approximately 20 mph (30 km/h). 

The set speed is indicated in the instrument cluster in the familiar way; by a mark that moves round the 
speed reading. Notes are added to the displays in the instrument cluster, if necessary. 

If the vehicle's own deceleration is not sufficient to maintain the preset speed, the brake is activated 
accordingly. 

If ECO PRO or SPORT mode is activated, cruise control is also set to a fuel-efficient or sporty driving 
style. Due to the fuel-efficient driving style in ECO PRO driving mode, in some situations the vehicle's 
speed may exceed or drop below the set speed, for example on downhill gradients or inclines.

The system is interrupted automatically in the following situations: 

• If the brakes are used. 

• If the selector lever position is moved out of position "D". 

• If the Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) is activated or the 
Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is deactivated. 

• If the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is performing an adjustment. 


21.3. Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function 

The Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function (ACC Stop&Go) is offered as a function of the Active 
Driving Assistant Plus, optional equipment (OE 5AT), for the G30. 

ACC Stop&Go adjusts a driver-specified set speed and, if required by the traffic situation, also 
automatically adjusts the preselected following distance to the vehicle driving ahead (detected 
vehicles include passenger cars, trucks and motorbikes). The application range of ACC Stop&Go 
ranges from higher speeds down to a standstill. The distance and the speed are automatically adjusted 
in this range.

G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

21. Cruise Control 



G30 Active Cruise Control (ACC) Stop&Go 

Depending on the stationary time, driving off from a standstill is performed automatically or in 
response to a prompt by the driver. ACC Stop&Go not only detects vehicles that are slowly coming 
to a stop, but also stationary vehicles. 

Due to improved monitoring in front of the vehicle, the system is capable of reacting more quickly to 
vehicles swinging in and out and turning off. 

The extended application range has been achieved by the incorporation of the KAFAS stereo camera. 
Image data is evaluated by the ACC Stop&Go system. The KAFAS control unit clearly detects vehicles 
when their rear ends are recorded by the camera. In addition, the KAFAS control unit ensures that the 
driving lane information, vehicle positions and movements are determined.

Object detection provided by a combination of radar sensor and KAFAS stereo camera. 


In addition to image data, radar data is also gathered and evaluated by the radar sensors. This fusion

G30 Radar sensor/KAFAS stereo camera fusion: Radar sensor object detection 


A 77 GHz radar sensor emits bundled electromagnetic waves. The echoes reflected by objects are 
received and evaluated by the radar sensor. This enables information about objects located in front of 
the radar sensor to be obtained. This information includes size, distance and the deduced speed. The 
system's radar sensor can identify vehicles ahead up to a distance of 650 ft (200 m), to a large extent 
irrespective of weather conditions.

21. Cruise Control 


Thanks to the radar sensor's improved detection capability and alignment with the image data from 
the KAFAS stereo camera, vehicles in neighboring lanes are also detected. If these vehicles are driving 
in their own lane, then ACC Stop&Go adapts the speed to the vehicle pulling in or vehicle ahead. As a 
result, a time lag selected by the driver is constantly maintained. 

ACC Stop&Go adjusts the speed if there is no vehicle driving directly ahead and automatically 
switches to distance control if the sensor system detects a slower vehicle in its lane. The system's 
Stop&Go function brings the vehicle to a complete standstill if necessary. 

Detecting the vehicle in front of the vehicle in front 

Additionally detecting the vehicle in front of the vehicle in front is likewise new on the G30. 

This is analyzed using the sensors already fitted. Object detection is based on a fusion of the front 
radar sensor and the KAFAS stereo camera. Both sensors are, in principle, capable of detecting a 
vehicle two positions ahead. 

In most cases, the vehicle in front of the vehicle in front is, however, concealed by the vehicle in front, 
which is why the camera can generally not detect it. The front radar, however, consistently provides 
good detection quality here by “looking under” the vehicle in front. 

The advantages of this are as follows: 

• Improved "driver-like" speed governing behavior 

• Smoother following driving (“ACC cruising”) 

• Enhanced dynamics for traffic light-controlled journeys 

• Driver-like behavior when approaching distant objects 

Evaluation of ultrasound data 

Since both the front radar sensor and the KAFAS stereo camera are only of limited use for close-range 
monitoring, the ultrasonic data for the ACC Stop&Go system is evaluated for the first time on the G30. 
The data is provided by the front ultrasonic sensors already described. These are needed to monitor 
the close range in front of the vehicle for freedom from obstacles. 

Coupling to the navigation system 

Improved cornering behavior is made possible by coupling ACC Stop&Go to the navigation system. 
This contributes to a further improvement of driver-like behavior. This also takes into consideration the 
intention to turn off the road and intersections, among other aspects. 

Restart time 

The restart time after automatic braking to a stop by ACC Stop&Go previously of approximately 
3 seconds has been raised to approximately 30 seconds on the G30. 

The prerequisite for extended restarting is that the vehicle is located on a highway or a divided 
highway outside the town. 


105 



G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

21. Cruise Control 


A _ 

If the vehicle in front starts driving again after being stopped (for more than approximately 3 seconds 
or longer than approximately 30 seconds on highways and divided highways), a note is shown to the 
driver. To drive off again the driver must confirm this note by pressing the RES/CNCL button or the 
accelerator pedal. 


Additional convenience is provided by the extended restart time without driver intervention. 

ACC Stop&Go does not only support the driver in flowing traffic, but also in traffic jam situations, both 
on multiple-lane highways and ordinary roads and on urban arterial and ring roads. 

The adjustment range for the set speed is limited to a maximum of 130 mph (210 km/h). 

If ECO PRO or SPORT mode is activated, the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function is also 
set to a fuel-efficient or sporty driving style. Due to the fuel-efficient driving style in ECO PRO driving 
mode, in some situations the vehicle's speed may exceed or drop below the set speed, for example on 
downhill gradients or inclines.

21. Cruise Control 

21.3.1. Operation 

Activation and deactivation 

The activation and deactivation of the ACC Stop&Go and the Dynamic Cruise Control are almost the 
same. ACC Stop&Go can either be activated while driving or at a standstill. For safety reasons, when 
the vehicle is at a standstill the function can only be put in Standby mode or deactivated while the foot 
brake is applied. 

If the function is active, it can be interrupted by pressing the RES/CNCL button. The distance and 
speed will no longer be maintained and the set speed is greyed out in the instrument cluster. 

The driver can select a desired distance in four stages using the left-hand multifunction button on the 
multifunction steering wheel (MFL). The following distance most recently selected is saved depending 
on the key being used. 

• The following graphic shows the button assignment for the Driver Assistance Systems on the 

multifunction steering wheel (MFL) in vehicles with the Active Driving Assistant Plus optional

The following conditions must also be satisfied for activation: 

• Seat belt fastened and doors closed 

• Drive position "D" engaged and brake pressed 

• Engine running 

• Parking brake not activated 

• Camera and radar sensor operational 

• No system faults detected 


The system is interrupted automatically in the following situations: 

• If the brakes are used. 

• If the selector lever position is moved out of position "D". 

• If the Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) is activated or the 
Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is deactivated. 

• If the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is performing an adjustment. 

• If the seat belt is unfastened and the driver's door is opened in a stationary vehicle. 

• If the system has not detected an object for a long time, e.g. on rarely frequented sections of 
road with no distinct edge. 

• If the detection range of the radar is impaired, e.g. due to contamination or heavy precipitation. 

• Following a longer immobilization period, if the vehicle has been decelerated to a standstill by 
ACC Stop&Go. 

The set speed is indicated in the instrument cluster in the familiar way; by a mark that moves round 
the speed reading. If ACC Stop&Go is activated, this mark is green, whereas in "Standby" mode it is 
grey and the last set speed is displayed. After the ACC Stop&Go function is activated or after the driver 
has adjusted the set speed, the current digital value is displayed. If the distance is changed, a symbol 
appears briefly as an acknowledgement. The symbol screen masks are for example the set speed and 
the distance bar. With each subsequent operation the display is shown for another three seconds. 

The distances set by the driver, as well as the distances to any vehicles driving ahead, that must be 
maintained to ensure a safe distance are displayed between the two round instruments (speed reading 
and engine speed display). The distance setting is stored for the ID transmitter currently being used. 

As with DCC, the symbol screen masks are complemented, if necessary, with notes in the instrument 
cluster for ACC Stop&Go. 

With active control the displays are also shown in the Head-Up Display (optional equipment OE 610). 

If the system can no longer adjust a safe distance, for example due to very high differential speeds, 
then the driver is prompted to take over the vehicle handling by a flashing red vehicle symbol and an 
acoustic signal.

24. Lane Keeping & Traffic Jam Assistants 

What drivers wish for most while driving is relief from monotonous situations such as sitting in a jam 
or slow moving traffic. In addition to Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function, drivers are now also 
supported by Active Lane Keeping Assistant. The Active Lane Keeping Assistant was first introduced 
in the G12. 

The Active Lane Keeping Assistant and Traffic Jam Assistant are part of the Active Driving Assistant 
Plus, optional equipment (OE 5AT). 

The system assists the driver in keeping the vehicle in lane by initiating corrective steering 
interventions if required. 



G30 Active steering intervention 


24.1. Functional principle 

Depending on the speed, the system is guided by the lane edges or vehicles driving ahead. 

The position of the lane edges and the vehicle driving ahead is determined with the help of five radar 
sensors and the KAFAS stereo camera.

G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

24. Lane Keeping & Traffic Jam Assistants 

The system has two subfunctions: the Traffic Jam Assistant (second generation) and the Active Lane 
Keeping Assistant. 

The Traffic Jam Assistant is available for speeds up to approximately 43 mph (70 km/h), the Active 
Lane Keeping Assistant from approximately 43 mph (70 km/h) to approximately 130 mph (210 km/h). 

The table below shows an overview of the differences between the two subfunctions:

direction of the vehicle driving ahead 

Corrective steering interventions in the direction 
of the center of the lane 

Detected lane markings taken into 
consideration 

Gaps in lane markings can be bridged for a 
limited time by aligning with vehicle ahead 


If the Traffic Jam and Active Lane Keeping Assistants are activated, the Side Collision Avoidance is 
also interlinked. 


24.1.1. Hands-off-Detection 

To ensure the driver is alert and able to react, he is urged to always have both hands on the steering 
wheel when the Active Lane Keeping Assistant and Traffic Jam Assistant are activated (established in 
the German road traffic regulations). If the driver takes both hands off the steering wheel rim, control is 
stopped after a few seconds during active control and the driver is requested to take over steering. 

Additional information about Hands-off-Detection may be found in the “G12 Driver Assistance 
Systems” reference manual (section 23.1.1). 

24.1.2. Functional prerequisites 

The following prerequisites must be met in order for the Active Lane Keeping Assistant and Traffic 
Jam Assistant to be used: 

• Speed must be below 130 mph (210 km/h). 

• Above 43 mph (70 km/h): both lane edges must be detected. 

• Below 43 mph (70 km/h): both lane edges or a vehicle driving ahead must be detected. 

• The lane width must be sufficient. 

• The vehicle should be positioned as centrally as possible in the lane. 

• There must be a sufficient curve radius. 

• At least one hand must be on the steering wheel rim. 

• The turn indicator must not be activated. 

• The camera calibration process must be completed immediately after vehicle delivery. 

The active lateral control function with data evaluation of the KAFAS stereo camera is implemented 
with the assistance of the lane markings identified on the left and right. 


116 






G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

24. Lane Keeping & Traffic Jam Assistants 

In order for the system to be activated, two lane boundary lines must be detected. Below a speed of 
approximately 43 mph (70 km/h) a vehicle driving ahead in the same lane is sufficient to activate the 
system. 

The system is put in Standby mode if the marginal conditions are not satisfied (e.g. hands not on 
steering wheel, lane too narrow or dazzling of KAFAS stereo camera). Once all marginal conditions 
have been met, the system is re-enabled automatically. 

To activate the system, the speed of the vehicle is another input quantity that is evaluated. The system 
uses these values to decide which function will be enabled. As mentioned above, the threshold values 
are set as follows: 

• The Traffic Jam Assistant can be enabled within a speed range of 0 to approximately 43 mph 
(70 km/h). 

• The Active Lane Keeping Assistant can be enabled within a speed range from approximately 
43 to approximately 130 mph (70 to approximately 210 km/h). 


24.1.3. Lane change 

For a lane change to be as comfortable as possible, the Active Lane Keeping Assistant and Traffic Jam 
Assistant are put silently into Standby mode when the turn indicator is activated and reactivates itself 
automatically once the turn indicator is back in its initial position and a lane change has occurred. 

24.1.4. Function logic 

The main function logic of the lateral guidance is implemented in the Optional Equipment System 
(SAS) control unit. 

The majority of the data for the function is provided by the KAFAS stereo camera, where algorithms for 
the lane and object detection run. 

Vehicle dynamics data, such as the driving speed, wheel speeds, yaw rate, steering angle, lateral 
acceleration, longitudinal acceleration, etc., is provided by the rest of the vehicle network via a FlexRay 
or CAN connection. 

A target trajectory (also known as a path curve) is calculated in the Optional Equipment System (SAS) 
control unit. This is used to determine whether a steering correction is required. 


117 



G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

24. Lane Keeping & Traffic Jam Assistants 

24.1.5. Steering interventions 

If the current course of the vehicle deviates too much from the target trajectory (path curve), a steering 
correction is initiated. 

The steering intervention is a corrective measure. This means the driver is not relieved of his duty to 
steer the vehicle. As the corrective steering interventions are limited to approximately 1.5 m/s 2 based 
on the lateral acceleration, the system cannot navigate curves above the respective speed-dependent 
curve radius without the driver's assistance. The driver must therefore steer the vehicle at the same 
time in order to stay on the roadway. 

The target trajectory and required steering corrections are calculated based on the driving speed as 
follows: 

Speed range 0 to 43 mph (0 to 70 km/h): 

• The position and previous movements of the vehicle driving ahead are given priority when 
determining the appropriate steering corrections. 

• Detected lane markings are taken into account to avoid unwanted steering corrections that 
would result in leaving the lane. 

• Corrective steering interventions in the direction of the center of the lane are initiated if the 
vehicle detects there is not a vehicle driving ahead. 

Speed range 43 to 80 mph (70 km/h to 130 km/h): 

• Corrective steering interventions in the direction of the center of the lane are initiated. 

• It is possible to bridge the gap for a limited time where lane markings are not detected by 
estimating the course of the lane based on the vehicle driving ahead. 

Speed range 80 to 130 mph (130 km/h to 210 km/h): 

• Corrective steering interventions in the direction of the center of the lane are initiated. 

• For safety reasons above a driving speed of approximately 80 mph (130 km/h) the course of 
the lane is not estimated using the vehicle driving ahead. 

The vehicle driving ahead is given priority as the "correction target" at speeds up to approximately 43 
mph (70 km/h) due to the limited detection of lane markings. 

In traffic jams or slow-moving traffic following distances are often extremely small (< 30 ft (< 10 m)) due 
to tailgating and lanes ahead are often partially covered due to staggered driving. 

This means the KAFAS stereo camera is unable to correctly interpret the lane markings in some cases. 

When classifying the object driving ahead, vehicles such as motorbikes are not used as the "correction 
target". 


118 



G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

24. Lane Keeping & Traffic Jam Assistants 

Steering momentum 

The driving dynamics function software in the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) control unit calculates a 
target steering torque based on the curve nominal value. The target steering torque is then converted 
to an engine torque by the Electronic Power Steering (EPS), which finally results in a steering wheel 
movement at the wheels. 

The maximum steering torque has been set in such a way that it can always be overruled by the driver 
and therefore steering past the maximum steering torque is possible. 

24.1.6. Operation 

The system is switched on via the Traffic Jam Assistant button on the multifunction steering wheel 
(MFL).

24.1.7. Deactivation criteria 

The Active Lane Keeping Assistant and Traffic Jam Assistant is deactivated automatically 
in the following situations: 

• If the vehicle departs from the detected lane or the lane width does not meet the 
requirements. 

• If the lane edges of the current lane are not detected by the KAFAS stereo camera. 

• If no vehicle driving ahead is detected. 

• The vehicle is travelling at a speed greater than 130 mph (210 km/h). 

• If the Hands-off-Detection cannot detect the hands (at least one hand) on the steering wheel 
rim. The system is switched off once a defined time threshold (several seconds) has elapsed. 

• Due to the radius of the bend in the road, the inner lane edge is no longer detected due to the 
camera aperture angle. 

• Pedestrian protection assumes the operating condition "Fault exists". 

• If the turn indicator is on. 

• The driver intervenes actively in the steering. 

• If over a certain time period no lane edges are detected and there is not a vehicle 
driving ahead. 

• If the driver manually deactivates the DSC (DSC off). 

• If there is an intervention from the preventative pedestrian protection. 

• After Dynamic Brake Control braking (brake assistant). 


24.1.8. Limits of the system 

When driving in narrow lanes, e.g. when driving through construction zones or when emergency lanes 
are formed, the system cannot be activated or used meaningfully. 

A_ 

Due to the limited detection capacity of the KAFAS stereo camera, the driver must remain alert and 
observant in order to be able to actively intervene at any time so as to avoid the risk of an accident. 

The system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic 
situation. The driver is solely responsible for the vehicle. 


121 





G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

25. Active Lane Keeping Assistant 

The Active Lane Keeping Assistant with Side Collision Avoidance is part of the Active Driving 
Assistant Plus, optional equipment (OE 5AT). 

By making corrective steering interventions, the system, already familiar from the G12 helps the driver 
to keep the vehicle in lane at speeds from approximately 43 mph (70 km/h) to approximately 130 mph 
(210 km/h) and to actively avoid potential side collisions. The system endeavors to orient the vehicle in 
its lane according to the situation and within the framework of the system limits. 

The system consists of the following four subfunctions: 

• Side Collision Avoidance 

• Reduced Side Collision Avoidance 

• Lane Departure Warning 

• Blind Spot Detection 


25.1. Side Collision Avoidance 

The table below shows an overview of the functional characteristics of the "Side Collision Avoidance" 
subfunction:

• Sufficient available space 
on the roadway 



25.1.1. Reduced Side Collision Avoidance 

The Reduced Side Collision Avoidance comes into play if it is not possible to adequately monitor the 
available space on the roadway or there is no available space on the roadway. 

The Reduced Side Collision Avoidance is interlinked with the Active Lane Keeping Assistant and 
Traffic Jam Assistant functions.

The Active Lane Keeping Assistant with Side Collision Avoidance does not relieve the driver of his 
overall responsibility for driving the vehicle. Due to the system limits be attentive in order to be able to 
actively intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident. 


124 







G30 Driver Assistance Systems 

26. Evasion Aid 


Often a collision with another vehicle (at the end of a traffic jam for example) or obstacle can only 
be prevented by an avoidance maneuver. Since the driver's response time plays a decisive role in 
an avoidance maneuver just as in a braking maneuver, Evasion Aid is able to make a considerable 
contribution to avoiding an impending collision. 

Evasion Aid supports the driver in such critical driving situations with a focused steering intervention 
if the driver needs to avoid an obstacle. The system also help keep the vehicle stable during and after 
the avoidance maneuver. 

This is achieved by an interaction between the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), the Electronic Power 
Steering (EPS) and the analysis of data from the assistance sensors. 



G30 Evasion Aid: interaction of Dynamic Stability Control) DSC) and Electronic Power Steering (EPS) 


Evasion Aid is a function of the Active Driving Assistant Plus, optional equipment (OE 5AT), and is 
fitted in the G30 for the first time. 


26.1. Functional principle 

An emergency avoidance maneuver takes place when a suddenly occurring obstacle is detected in 
front of the vehicle and the driver has to avoid this obstacle quickly and without “significant” braking. 

Evasion Aid supports the driver in avoidance maneuvers in emergency situations and calculates an 
optimum “escape track” past the obstacle. 

The “escape track” is calculated within the physical limits of the particular vehicle. The calculated 
“escape track” is designed to minimize transverse dynamics.

The vehicle is preconditioned before an anticipated avoidance maneuver. 

Here all functions that contribute to stabilize the vehicle are adapted in their configuration for the 
maximum support of the driver. This can reduce the risk of unstable vehicle behavior or overloading the 
driver in an acute avoidance maneuver. 

Evasion Aid checks the current vehicle inclination and the driver's steering wheel actions and 
compares the information with the computed “escape track”. Should the system detect discrepancies, 
an appropriate steering intervention is applied to steer the vehicle to the previously estimated “escape 
track”. 

The design objective for the system was that the driver's selected steering is not bypassed, but 
instead the feel of the steering wheel use is modified. The driver is supported by an additional support 
torque in the Electronic Power Steering (EPS) for the avoidance maneuver. 

If a collision-threatening situation is detected and an acute warning has been issued, Evasion Aid 
evaluates the traffic situation.

The possible free space for an avoidance maneuver is analyzed on the basis of this critical situation. 
Radar sensors and the KAFAS stereo camera monitor the vehicle's surroundings. The system can 
intervene to provide support if an avoidance opportunity next to the vehicle in front is available and if 
no collision object has been detected to the side of the own vehicle. 

The system assists the driver in the speed range from 25-100 mph (40 to 160 km/h). 

The driver initiates the avoidance maneuver by turning the steering wheel rapidly, at the same time 
determining the avoiding direction. Any brake intervention initiated by the acute warning is aborted or 
suppressed as appropriate. The Electronic Power Steering (EPS) implements a supporting steering 
intervention. 

The vehicle is made “more agile” by the system as it steers around the obstacle and then stabilized 
again when it reaches the escape lane. 

Rapid and effective avoidance is possible thanks to the vehicle's improved response to steering 
commands, without endangering the general driving stability.

The hard shoulder may be used as the escape lane, in addition to a normal lane. 

A. 

The supporting steering intervention by the system is not performed until after the driver has actively 
initiated the avoidance maneuver. An avoidance maneuver by Evasion Aid alone is thus not performed. 
The driver must likewise determine the direction of the avoidance.

26.2. System overview 

Below we describe which main components or sensors are relevant to Evasion Aid. 

• Object or obstacles are detected by means of the KAFAS stereo camera and the ACC 
Stop&Go front radar sensor. 

• The four side radar sensors monitor the area around the vehicle. The data from the KAFAS 
stereo camera is also analyzed and in this way a possible free space for an avoidance 
maneuver can be identified. 

• A target trajectory (also known as a path curve), that is the “escape track” itself, is calculated in 
the Optional Equipment System (SAS) control unit. 

• The driving dynamics function software in the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) control unit 
calculates a target steering torque based on the “escape track”. 

• The target steering torque is converted to an engine torque by the Electronic Power Steering 
(EPS), which finally results in a supporting steering intervention, if necessary. 

The maximum steering torque has been set in such a way that it can always be overruled by 
the driver and therefore steering past the maximum steering torque is possible.

26.3. Operation 

A special precondition such as the individual configuration capability for the system or deactivation of 
this function only is not possible. 

Evasion Aid can only be deactivated by switching off all Intelligent Safety systems (ALL OFF). 

A_ 

The system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic 
situation. The driver is solely responsible for the vehicle. 


26.4. Functional prerequisites 

Evasion Aid is not linked to a particular road type. 

The following parameters are the prerequisites for the availability of Evasion Aid: 

• The vehicle's speed must not be below approximately 25 mph (40 km/h) and 
be no higher than approximately 100 (160 km/h). 

• The system must have identified a free space for an avoidance maneuver. 

Evasion Aid is generally not available in the following cases: 

• The vehicle's speed is below approximately 25 mph (40 km/h) or higher 
than approximately 100 mph (160 km/h). 

• During a dynamic overtaking maneuver initiated by the driver. 

• If the Dynamic Stability Control has been switched off by the driver, 
or there is a fault in the DSC. 

• When all Intelligent Safety systems are switched off. 

• In the event of systemic limitations of the radar sensors or the KAFAS stereo camera.

26.5. Limits of the system 

The collision warning has a limited capacity for detection. As a result, incorrect or delayed warnings 
may occur and consequently Evasion Aid is limited in its operation. It is also possible that the following 
vehicles are not detected: 

• A slow vehicle when driving off at high speed. 

• Vehicles that suddenly swerve or decelerate rapidly. 

• Vehicles with an unusual rear view or with insufficiently visible rear lights. 

• Partially concealed vehicles. 

• Two-wheeled vehicles travelling ahead. 

The function of the KAFAS stereo camera and the radar sensors, and thus the function of Evasion Aid 
may be impaired in the following situations: 

• Heavy fog, rain, spray or snow. 

• Insufficient light. 

• Strong light in the camera lens. 

• If the field of view of the KAFAS stereo camera or the windscreen is dirty. 

• On sharp bends. 

• Up to 10 seconds after engine start via the START-STOP button. 

• On restriction or deactivation of the driving dynamics systems, for example DSC OFF. 

• During the calibration process for the KAFAS stereo camera immediately after vehicle 
delivery or a camera change. 

A_ 

Evasion Aid does not release the driver from his comprehensive responsibility as the driver. There can 
be functional limitations because of system restrictions.
