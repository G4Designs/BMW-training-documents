1.1. Overview 



BMW 8 Series Coupe 

The new BMW 8 Series Coupe with development code G15 is completely new model for BMW. 

• BMW M850i xDrive. 

The M850i xDrive comes standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission, Integral Active Steering, 
Electric Roll Stabilization, Adaptive M Suspension Professional, M Sport Brakes, M Sport Differential 
and the xDrive all-wheel drive which is already familiar from the G12. 

Compared to the FI 3, its proportions are considerably more sporty. Despite the low vehicle height, the 
headroom at the front is on a par with its predecessor. To achieve the extremely flat outline, neither a 
roof aerial nor a tilt and slide or panoramic glass sunroof is available. 


1.2. Dimensions and comparison of outlines 

The exterior dimensions of the G15 in the European version are shown below.

The lightweight body concept of the G15 envisages components made of high-strength hot-formed 
steel, aluminium and carbon. Thanks to the material mix, the materials are able to contribute their 
specific strengths to the vehicle in the best possible way. 

The number of aluminium components (die-cast and extruded profiles) has increased considerably. In 
contrast with the FI 3, the engine supports, rear side members and spring strut domes are now made 
of aluminium. In addition to the G12 and the G30, the G15 now belongs to the 3rd series in which 
structural components made of aluminium are used in the rear end.

G15 Underbody 


Compared to the FI 3, the undercarriage in the area of the rear has once again been closed further. 
This plays a significant role in the aerodynamics and CO 2 reduction. The use of textile material 
improves the external acoustics and at the same time reduces weight. 


3.3. Carbon components 

Various carbon components for the G15 can be ordered with the optional equipment M Carbon 
exterior package (SA 71C): 

• Air guide element for air curtain 

• Trims at the front ornamental grille (omitted in vehicles with front radar sensor) 

• Exterior mirror covers 

• Rear spoiler 

• Diffuser insert. 

An M carbon roof can also be ordered with the optional equipment SA 40C.

The G15 also features the familiar 3rd generation air flap control which has been used since the G12. 
The air flaps are located inside the ornamental grille surround at the top and behind the central air inlet 
of the lower bumper panel. 

The top and bottom air flaps are controlled by separate actuators. When a corresponding cooling 
request is received, the bottom air flaps always open first and then the top air flaps The air flaps at the 
bottom can also have several intermediate settings. 

A new feature of the G15 is that the brake air ducts can now also be closed via the flap system at the 
bottom.

4.1. Overview 

Taking into account the repair stages of the BMW workshop information system, the body repair work 
in the Technical Qualification is divided into 3 repair levels. Each of the 3 Body Repair Levels includes 
certain prerequisites in terms of the qualifications of the employees and the workshop equipment. 

The special characteristics of the mounted body parts and materials used in the outer body skin are 
described in this chapter. 

For information on the basic procedure for carrying out adjustment work on body mounted parts, 
refer to the "Body Repair Level 1" product information of the body standard qualification and also the 
workshop information system.

BMW is using a tailgate made of plastic (SMC 1 ) with paintable surface for the first time. The IMC 

method 2 is being used to manufacture the tailgate. Additional lining components are not required. 
This provides more geometrical design freedom and reduces weight. 

1 SMC (Sheet Molding Compound): plate-shaped, doughy compounds made of thermosetting resins 
for production of fiber-reinforced plastics. 

2 IMC (in-mould coating): procedure during which the surface of the shaped part is coated while still in 
the mould.

G15 exterior rearview mirror 


For the first time at BMW, the exterior mirrors are integrated into the window recess finisher strips of 
frameless doors. This gives the appearance of a decorative strip which runs through into the mirror 
head. 

Exterior mirror caps made of carbon are available in combination with the optional equipment M 
Carbon exterior package (SA 71C).

Index 

Explanation

Lightweight support 


The lightweight support is mounted on the door structure by means of screws and bayonet fittings. 

It divides the interior of the door into a dry and wet side. The dry side is closed off to the inside by 
the door trim panel and the wet side is closed towards the outside by the door outer skin. Sensitive 
components - such as loudspeakers and airbag sensors - are located on the dry side and are thus 
optimally protected against moisture. 

The power window mechanism is based on a cable mechanism. The electrical drive force is provided 
by an electric motor which - in contrast with the G11/G12 - is installed on the wet side of the 
lightweight support. 

In contrast to the G05, instead of being activated via pulse-width modulated signals, the power 
window motors in the G15 are activated via relays as before.

5.3. Front seats 



G15 front seat 


In the standard seat for the M850i xDrive is the multifunction seat, for the driver and front passenger. 
These are also equipped with backrest width and seat depth adjustment and a lumbar support. 

The following optional equipment can also be ordered (among others): 


• Front active seat ventilation (SA 453) 

• Seat heating for driver and front passenger (SA 494) 

The distribution of heat between seat cushions and backrests can be 
controlled in combination with the multifunction seats (SA 4FM). 

• M seat belts (SA 4GQ). 


A massage function is not available for the G15. 

Visually integrated head restraints are equipped with all the functionality and comfort of a height and 
depth-adjustable head restraint. A head rest characteristic map control prevents a collision with the 
headliner.

The switches for fore-and-aft seat adjustment are on the seat. So they can be easily seen and used, 
they are mounted tilted towards the passengers. The comfort entry is activated via a leather loop on 
the back of the seat in the area of the backrest upper section. 

In contrast to the FI 3, a conventional seat belt system with belt deflector support on the B-pillars is 
used in the G15.

The buttons for seat heating and active seat ventilation are centralized in the G15. To ensure the two 
systems are fully functional therefore, it is necessary to make settings at the CID. 

The seat heating and/or the active seat ventilation can be switched on and off by pressing the seat 
heating/seat and climate control button on the air conditioning control panel. Different intensity levels 
can be selected by pressing the button several times. 

After switching on, a corresponding display appears in the CID, where further settings can be made via 
the touchscreen or controller. 

Seat climate control 

The seat climate control combines the seat heating and active seat ventilation functions.

5. Interior Equipment 

If both systems are active, one push of the button reduces the intensity of both functions by one level. 
The last function to be active is immediately activated when the system is switched back on. If both 
functions were switched off at the same time, the system automatically activates the seat heating 
when it is switched back on. 



G15 active seat ventilation 


Index 

Explanation 

1 

Central fan 


A suction ventilation system is being used in the front seats for the first time at BMW. With this 
system, the cooler air is drawn out of the interior past the body into the seat. This improves the 
subjective perception of the cooling power. 

Additionally, a single fan (central fan) is mounted for the first time under the structure of the front seat 
instead of the single fan in the seat cushion surface.
