G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 


Assistance systems are becoming increasingly important in automotive engineering. "Autonomous 
driving" is a topic that is of great significance for mobility in the future, for example. 

The G12 laid the foundation here, and the range of assistance systems was extended once more to 
include new, revolutionary systems with the G30. 

The assistance systems in the new BMW X3 offer the driver extensive options for assisted driving. The 
G01 therefore also features the product strategy introduced with the G30. 

Today, numerous and increasingly intelligent assistance systems are being incorporated in motor 
vehicles. The interaction of the many different systems supports the driver in every respect. Whether 
by offering greater comfort when driving or parking or by providing a reassuring feeling of safety in all 
situations. 


1.1. BMW Personal CoPilot 

The generic term BMW Personal CoPilot will be used in future to describe all available assistance 
systems and activities on the road to highly and full automated driving and autonomous parking. 

The term shows that even with increasing automation, the driver decides at all times but can be 
provided with assistance when required. 

BMW Personal CoPilot should therefore not be seen as optional equipment, but functions instead 
as a "generic term" for the assistance systems for automated driving, comparable with BMW 
ConnectedDrive, which still serves as umbrella term for bundling the services and apps for vehicle 
networking. 


1.2. The road to "Autonomous driving" 

Some assistance systems seem to control complex operations so independently that the term 
"autonomous driving" is frequently used in the media. We must therefore ask ourselves the question 
what "autonomous driving" really is. 

In order to describe different scenarios and ensure clarity, agreement was reached on classification in 
different levels of automation. 

Whereas the German Federal Highway Research Institute uses 4 levels for classification up to fully 
automated driving, the automotive industry adds Level 5 as a further important classification level. 


1 



G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 

1.2.1. Overview of classification levels 



Classification levels 


• Level 1 

Assistance systems assist the driver in vehicle operation, e.g. active cruise control. The driver 
is not relieved of his full responsibility for driving the vehicle. 

• Level 2 

In the case of semi-automated driving, the systems assist the driver in longitudinal and 
lateral guidance of the vehicle by acceleration and braking or when parking and manoeuvring. 
At this level, the driver must always monitor the activated functions and remains 
responsible for the driving task. 

• Level 3 

With highly-automated driving, the driver no longer has to permanently monitor the systems 
and is allowed for the first time to turn his attention to secondary activities. Nevertheless, he 
must be in a position to take back control over the vehicle within a prewarning time. 
When the system is activated, the vehicle independently performs functions such as activating 
the turn indicators and also carries out longitudinal and lateral guidance to keep the vehicle in 
lane or change lane. The system requests the driver to take control if it detects its limits. This 
form of automated driving is technically partially possible today. However, Level 3 vehicles are 
not yet approved by the statutory authorities for use on public roads. 

• Level 4 

Designates fully automated driving. At this level, the vehicle can perform driving tasks on 
its own from start to finish. The driver no longer has to monitor the system and can devote 
extensive attention to other things. However, here also the occupants are requested to 
take over driving tasks again if special situations occur which mean that the system 
reaches its limits. With this technological level, BMW will give its customers the choice of 
steering the vehicle themselves. 


2 








G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 

• Level 5 

This is complete autonomy of the vehicle. The vehicle is fully responsible for driving, 

driverless operation is possible and the presence of a driver is no longer necessary. 

"Autonomous driving" means independent driving of a vehicle to a specific target in real traffic without 
the intervention of a human driver. However, a number of prerequisites are still missing for realization of 
this level, including the necessary legal basis. 

Due to the high technological level of a G12 and the G30, and now also the new BMW X3 (G01), these 
models are all classified as Level 2 vehicles. 

Drivers are still expected to drive with both hands on the steering wheel, although systems would 
today already be in a position to drive the vehicle autonomously in certain situations. 

The assistance systems help to make the driver's life easier by: 

• Providing the driver with information. 

• Prompting the driver with suggestions. 

• Automatically intervening in the driving process. 

This Product Information contains an overview of all the assistance systems used in the G01: 

• Frontal Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation 

• Daytime Pedestrian Protection 

• Lane Departure Warning 

• Blind Spot Detection 

• Side Collision Avoidance 

• Road Sign Recognition 

• Proactive Driving Assistant 

• Fatigue and Focus Alert 

• Camera systems 

• Park Distance Control 

• Cross Traffic Alert 

• Parking Manoeuvring Assistant 

• Speed control 

• Speed limit warning 

• Traffic Jam Assistant 

• Active Lane Keeping Assistant with Side Collision Avoidance 

• Evasion Aid 

Identifying road users driving ahead as well as detecting objects and lane edges are among the most 
important prerequisites for the assistance systems. This applies not only for the far range but also the 
close range.

G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 


The optional functions available for the G01 are implemented either as camera-based systems with 
a shared camera and integrated control unit, or using sensors such as ultrasonic or radar sensors. 
Evaluation signals provided by various control units (for example, from the Advanced Crash Safety 
Module (ACSM)) are also taken into consideration. 


1.3. Further information 

The assistance systems of the new BMW X3 build on those of the BMW 7 Series G12. Accompanying

3. KAFAS 

3.1. Functional limitations 

The function of the KAFAS stereo camera and thus the function of the corresponding assistance 
systems may be impaired due to the physical limits of the optical systems, for example in the following 
situations: 

• Heavy fog, rain, spray or snow 

• Strong light in the camera lens 

• If the field of view of the KAFAS stereo camera or the windscreen is dirty 

• On tight bends 

• If boundary lines are missing, worn, poorly visible, converging or diverging, or not clearly 
recognizable, as may be the case when roadworks are being carried out 

• If boundary lines are covered by snow, ice, dirt or water 

• If boundary lines are covered by objects 

• If driving at close proximity to a vehicle driving ahead 

• If the windscreen in front of the interior mirror is misted over, soiled or covered by stickers, e.g. 
tax discs, etc. 

• Up to 10 seconds after driving readiness is activated via the start/stop button 

• During the calibration process for the KAFAS stereo camera immediately after vehicle delivery 
or a camera change 



Example of limits of the KAFAS stereo camera 


A 

Due to functional limitations and system restrictions it may transpire that warnings and orders are not 
issued, are issued too late or are unwarranted. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively 
intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident.

6. Intelligent Safety 

Nowadays, we simply cannot imagine driving without assistance systems. Ever increasing traffic on 
our roads makes ever increasing demands on man and machine. The systems have different functions: 
some gather information to help the driver in the decision-making process, others take on the driver's 
roles in monotonous traffic situations or intervene to make corrections. 

The assistance systems support the driver on highways and in urban environments. In urban traffic, 
for example, systems such as pedestrian warning with city braking function provide support. The lane 
departure and lane change warning as well as the side collision avoidance provide even more safety in 
traffic. Accidents can be avoided through automatic brake interventions, active steering interventions 
or a combination of both. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, the driver has a multitude of individual configurations available in 
the Intelligent Safety menu. For some systems, no configuration options are provided by the operating 
concept. Thus, for example, the Evasion Aid can only be deactivated by switching off all Intelligent 
Safety systems (ALL OFF). 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, Intelligent Safety consists of one or several systems, which can 
help to avoid a potential collision. The following systems are offered in the G01: 

• Frontal Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation 

• Pedestrian Warning with City Braking Activation function 

• Lane Departure Warning 

• Lane Change Warning 

• Side Collision Avoidance 

• Evasion Aid 

The Intelligent Safety button, already familiar from other BMW models, enables the assistance 
systems to be operated centrally. This means the systems can be switched on or off using a button 
and the submenu can be called up to personalize the settings.

7. Collision Warning 

7.1. Introduction 

The collision warning first provides a visual warning and then also an acoustic warning about critical 
traffic situations. If the driver does not react, the system will initiate emergency braking as necessary in 
the event of danger. 

The version of the collision warning system: 

• Front Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation 

The camera-based collision warning is part of the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant 
(OE 5AS) in the G01. 

On vehicles that have the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant (OE 5AS) as well as the active 
cruise control with Stop&Go function (OE 5DF), the radar sensor of the cruise control is also used 
to control the collision warning (in this case the vehicle is automatically equipped with the collision 
warning system with braking function). 

The collision warning system with braking function is part of the optional equipment Active Driving 
Assistant Plus (OE 5AT) in the G01. In the case of the collision warning system with braking function, 
there is system fusion of the KAFAS stereo camera and ACC radar sensor (front radar sensor). 

Vehicles with the Active Driving Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT) have the Active Cruise 
Control with Stop&Go function optional equipment (OE 5DF) integrated as standard. 

If the vehicle is not equipped with the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant (OE 5AS) or Active 
Driving Assistant Plus (OE 5AT), but does have the optional equipment active cruise control with 
Stop&Go function (OE 5DF), the customer also receives a collision warning system with braking 
function. 

The system warns the driver in situations where a collision is imminent. The early warning, a visual 
signal, is issued first to draw the driver's attention to the situation. If the situation becomes more 
critical, an acute early warning in the form of a visual and acoustic signal is issued. The nature of the 
warning is such that the driver can still prevent a collision providing he acts quickly. 

A_ _ 

The collision warning is dependent on the vehicle's own driving speed. The distance measured for the 
collision warning is significantly lower than the legally required minimum distance. It is therefore the 
responsibility of the driver to adhere to the legal minimum distance. 


7.2. Functional principle 

The KAFAS stereo camera captures the scene in front of the vehicle and detects entire rear views of 
moving and stationary vehicles in the field of view using image processing. 

In vehicles with Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function (OE 5DF) or the optional equipment 
Active Driving Assistant Plus (OE 5AT), the information of the radar sensor is evaluated in addition to 
the image data from the KAFAS stereo camera.

The corresponding warning stages "prewarning" and "acute warning" are output in critical situations 
on the basis of the calculated positions, distances and relative speeds of other vehicles. For the 
prewarning, the brakes of the vehicle are prepared and the activation thresholds of the brake 
assistant are reduced. This permits faster response characteristics of the brakes. If the driver makes 
the conscious decision to drive up close to the vehicle ahead, warnings which may otherwise be 
distracting can be prevented by reducing the sensitivity of the system. 

7.2.1. Front Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation 

The collision warning with city collision mitigation provides assistance from a speed of around 5 km/h 
(3 mph) up to a maximum speed of approx. 85 km/h (52 mph). This takes place with a supporting brake 
intervention if required. If the driver still does not react after an acute warning in this speed range, the 
vehicle will be decelerated by an automatically initiated brake intervention. The brake force of the brake 
intervention is regulated depending on the situation and can also reach maximum deceleration. 

In the G01, the camera-based collision warning with city braking function is part of the optional 
equipment Active Driving Assistant (OE 5AS) and is realized using the KAFAS stereo camera.

7.2.2. Collision warning with braking function 

The collision warning with braking function is active from a speed of around 5 km/h (3 mph) up to a 
maximum speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). 

If there is still no driver reaction after an acute warning in this speed range, a brake intervention will be 
automatically initiated. The automatically initiated brake intervention takes place in 2 different forms, 
depending on the speed of the vehicle. 

The brake intervention types differ as follows: 


Speed range 


Brake intervention 


Speed from around 5 km/h (3 mph) up to • The vehicle is decelerated by an automatically 
a speed of approx. 210 km/h (130 mph) initiated brake intervention* 


Speed from around 210 km/h (130 
mph) up to a maximum speed of approx. 
250 km/h (155 mph) 


Brake intervention takes place as a short 
braking jolt 

There is no automatic deceleration 


*The force of the brake intervention is situation-dependent. 

In the case of the collision warning system with braking function, there is system fusion of the KAFAS 
stereo camera and ACC radar sensor (front radar sensor).

7.3. Warning and braking function 

The operating principle of the collision warning is based on a detection and warning algorithm. The 
image processing system recognizes vehicles in the detection range of the camera. If there is a risk of 
a collision, a warning symbol is shown in the instrument cluster (KOMBI), or in the Head-Up Display for 
vehicles with the Head-Up Display optional equipment (OE 610). The warning function is divided into 
two stages. The next probable movement of an object is determined based on the current movement 
of the detected object and, taking into account the movement of the object, a collision risk is identified. 
If a situation is evaluated as critical by the warning algorithm, a warning is issued and braking is 
introduced based on a multistage warning concept.

G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

7. Collision Warning 

7.3.1. Displays 


Symbols 


Explanation 



Early warning: 

• Vehicle symbol lights up red 

• Increase distance and brake if necessary 



Acute warning: 

• Vehicle symbol flashes red and a signal 
sounds 

• Request for intervention by braking and 
evasive action, if necessary 


7.3.2. Early warning 

Occasions when an early warning is issued include when there is a collision risk because the vehicle 
driving ahead is being driven at a much slower speed and/or if the distance to a driven or stationary 
vehicle ahead is extremely short. 

An early warning is indicated by a vehicle symbol which lights up red in the instrument cluster (KOMBI) 
or Head-Up Display. 

The point at which the early warning is issued can be configured in the "Intelligent Safety systems 11 
menu on the Central Information Display (CID). 

A_ _ 

The collision warning is dependent on the vehicle's own driving speed. The distance measured for the 
collision warning is significantly lower than the legally required minimum distance. It is therefore the 
responsibility of the driver to adhere to the legal minimum distance. 


7.3.3. Acute warning 

The acute warning is issued by the system as late as possible and only if there is an immediate danger 
of a collision when the vehicle is approaching the vehicle driving ahead at a relatively high differential 
speed. The acute warning therefore cannot be deliberately brought about or monitored by the driver. 

If the vehicle is approaching the vehicle ahead very slowly, for example, no acute warning is issued 
even if the distance is very small. This way there are fewer meaningless and annoying acute warnings 
issued by the system. 

The acute warning cannot be deactivated separately. The timing of the acute warning also cannot be 
adjusted. If the acute warning is not to be issued, the "collision warning" front protective function must 
be deactivated. 


23 









G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

7. Collision Warning 

If an acute warning is issued, this is indicated to the driver by a red flashing vehicle symbol in the 
instrument cluster (KOMBI) or Head-Up Display. An acoustic warning signal also sounds. 

When the acute warning is issued, the brake system is also preconditioned in order to achieve quicker 
and sharper deceleration. With these measures the driver also receives specific support at the same 
time as the warning in order to be able to respond effectively. 

A_ 

The collision warning does not relieve the driver of his responsibility to adapt the speed and driving 
style to the traffic conditions. 


7.3.4. Brake intervention 

If the driver no longer has the option to avoid the accident with his own response, automatic brake 
intervention is effected as a last step. 

The automatically initiated brake intervention is functionally realized in different ways depending on 
the system installed in the vehicle, either "collision warning with city braking function" or "collision 
warning with braking function". Additional information on this is provided in section 7.2.1 "Collision 
warning with city braking function" and in section 7.2.2 "Collision warning with braking function". 

The brake force depends on the distance and differential speed in relation to the detected obstacle 
and may also correspond to maximum deceleration. The driver has the possibility to override and thus 
cancel the automatic panic braking at any time by means of a steering wheel movement (avoidance 
maneuver), acceleration or a strong brake intervention. 

For a brake intervention to be possible, the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) must be switched on. 
However, the brake intervention also takes place if DTC mode was previously activated, because 
Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is automatically activated in the event of a brake intervention initiated 
by the system. 


7.4. Operation 

The collision warning function is switched on and off via the Intelligent Safety button.

7.5. Limits of the system 

Range of detection 

A_ 

The collision warning has a limited capacity for detection. 

As a result, incorrect or delayed warnings may occur. It is possible the following vehicles are not 
detected: 

• A slow vehicle when driving off at high speed. 

• Vehicles that suddenly swerve or decelerate rapidly. 

• Vehicles with an unusual rear view or with insufficiently visible rear lights. 

• Partially concealed vehicles. 

• Two-wheeled vehicles travelling ahead.

Functional limitations 

The function of the KAFAS stereo camera and thus also the function of the corresponding assistance 
systems may be impaired in the following situations, for example: 

• Heavy fog, rain, spray or snow. 

• Insufficient light. 

• Strong light in the camera lens. 

• If the field of view of the KAFAS stereo camera or the windscreen is dirty. 

• On sharp bends. 

• Up to 10 seconds after engine start via the START-STOP button. 

• During the calibration process for the KAFAS stereo camera immediately after vehicle delivery 
or a camera change. 


A 

Due to functional limitations and system restrictions it may transpire that warnings and orders are not 
issued, are issued too late or are unwarranted. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively 
intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident.

8. Daytime Pedestrian Protection 

In the G01, the camera-based pedestrian warning with city braking function is part of the optional 
equipment Active Driving Assistant (OE 5AS) is done by using the KAFAS stereo camera. 

The pedestrian warning with city braking function is designed to prevent possible collisions with 
pedestrians in urban areas or reduce the effects of an accident. The system warns of a possible 
collision with pedestrians from a speed of approximately 5 km/h (3 mph) up to a maximum speed of 
65 km/h (40 mph) and assists the driver with a brake intervention shortly before a collision. 


8.1. Functional principle 

The KAFAS stereo camera captures the scene in front of the vehicle and detects pedestrians in the 
field of view using image processing. 



Example of person recognition by KAFAS camera 


Based on the calculated positions, distances and the movement of the detected pedestrians, an acute 
warning is issued in critical situations. A prewarning is not implemented with the pedestrian warning 
with city braking function. 

In the case of an acute warning, there is an automatic brake intervention up to maximum deceleration 
as necessary. 


8.2. Warning and braking function 

The image processing system recognizes persons in the detection range of the camera. Based on a 
detection and warning algorithm, a warning symbol in the form of a red flashing person is displayed 
in the instrument cluster KOMBI or in the optional equipment Head-Up Display (OE 610) if there is an 
imminent danger of a collision. An acoustic warning also sounds at the same time as display of the 
warning symbol.

Acute warning:

• Request for intervention by braking and

8.2.2. Acute warning/brake intervention 

On the basis of the current movement of the detected person, the probable further movement is 
determined and a possible collision risk calculated. A warning is issued if the warning algorithm 
evaluates a situation as being critical. Braking is also initiated automatically if necessary. 

Brake intervention 

If the driver is not longer able to prevent the collision by reacting on his own, an automatic brake 
intervention takes pace as the last step. The driver has the possibility to override and thus cancel the 
automatic panic braking at any time by means of a steering wheel movement (avoidance maneuver), 
acceleration or a strong brake intervention. 

For a brake intervention to be possible, the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) must be switched on. 
However, the brake intervention also takes place if DTC mode was previously activated, because 
Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is automatically activated in the event of a brake intervention initiated

9. Lane Departure Warning 


The lane departure warning is an element of the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant (OE 5AS) 
and the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Plus (OE 5AT). 

The lane departure warning detects lane markings from a speed of approximately 70 km/h (43 mph) 
and warns the driver against unintentionally leaving the lane. 

The information required about usable roadway and lane markings is provided by the KAFAS stereo 
camera. Based on the calculated positions, lane edges and curves in relation to the relative position of 
the driver's vehicle, a corresponding warning is issued. 

If the driver crosses the lane marking unintentionally (without using the turn indicator) or leaves the 
road boundary, he is warned haptically by the steering wheel vibrating gently and has the opportunity 
to react accordingly. The vibration in the steering wheel can be compared to the vibration effect when 
driving over a profiled road marking. 

In the settings menu the driver can set the desired strength of the haptic warnings on the steering 
wheel via the Drive.

A warning is not issued in the following situations: 

• Use of the turn indicator 

• In roadworks 

• Lane is narrower than 2.60 m. 

The warning is cancelled in the following situations: 

• Automatically after approximately 3 seconds 

• As soon as the driver moves back into his own lane 

• The turn indicator is used 

• When sharp braking or steering maneuvers are made 
and when the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) intervenes. 

9.3. Limits of the system 

The function of the system may not be available or may only be available to a limited extent in the 
following situations: 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• At sharp bends or on narrow roadways. 

• If boundary lines are covered by snow, ice, dirt or water. 

• If boundary lines are covered by objects. 

• If boundary lines are missing, worn, poorly visible, converging or diverging, or not clearly 
recognizable, such as when driving through roadworks.

When a vehicle is detected and the system is activated, the driver is informed of the situation by an 
unobtrusive indicator in the exterior mirror. By having this information before making a lane change 
maneuver, the driver can confidently prepare for the lane change and avoid critical situations from the 
outset.

The side collision avoidance assists the driver in avoiding a potential side collision. 

Four radar sensors monitor the area next to the vehicle and function regardless of the lighting 
conditions and largely irrespective of the weather conditions. 



If there is a risk of a collision, the corresponding indicator flashes (depending on which side the risk 
relates to, left or right) in the exterior mirror with high intensity and the steering wheel starts to vibrate.

Functional prerequisites 

A prerequisite for the activation of the side collision avoidance with steering intervention is that the 
lane markings must be detected by the KAFAS stereo camera. 

If the lane markings are not detected or if the driver is driving within the speed range of 30 km/h to 
70 km/h, only the Reduced Side Collision Avoidance is active. The warning functions in the form 
of the flashing indicator in the exterior mirror and the vibration of the steering wheel continue to be 
implemented. 

With the Reduced Side Collision Avoidance there is no active lateral guidance of the vehicle. In this 
case the driver is only warned by a single steering wheel pulse on the opposite side of the wheel to the 
danger. 

The side collision avoidance can be switched on and off via the iDrive menu by making the following 
selection via the controller: 

• "My Vehicle" 

• "Vehicle settings" 

• "Intelligent Safety"

12. Intersection Warning 

Intersections are some of the most likely points for accidents in urban traffic. Statistics tell us that 
approximately one accident in three with injury to persons occurs at a intersection. Accidents here can 
largely be attributed to distraction or poor estimation by the drivers. 

The intersection warning function was used for the first time in G30 and is able to make a significant 
contribution to safety. The new BMW X3 is also equipped with this innovative warning system. 

The driver is warned both visually and audibly in the event of a risk of a collision with crossing traffic. 
This can significantly reduce the likelihood of an accident or even the severity of an accident at 
Intersections. 

Intersection warning is an integral part of the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Plus 
(OE 5AT). 


12.1. Functional principle 

Intersection warning is able to detect an impending collision with crossing traffic in good time and so 
such collisions can possibly be prevented by this. 

The KAFAS stereo camera and the front radar sensor (ACC radar sensor) monitor the traffic 
conditions. The information obtained from these sources forms the basis for the system. The sensors 
detect the distance from other traffic and its speed and direction of movement. The speed of the car is 
also determined. 



GO! Intersection warning 



12.1.1. Warning 

A warning is issued if a risk of a collision (approximately 1 second before the collision) with crossing 
traffic is detected and its avoidance by the driver or the crossing traffic is only now possible through an 
uncomfortable maneuver. 


44 


G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

12. Intersection Warning 


A _ 

The warning is, however, only issued if the crossing traffic is travelling more slowly than the vehicle. 


So if the crossing vehicle is travelling faster than the car, no warning would be issued, as the crossing 
vehicle would be outside the detection range of the sensor system until shortly before the collision. 


Warning range

If the detection system identifies a hazardous situation, it prompts the driver into emergency braking 
by a visual and an audible warning. 

At the same time, the brake system is prefilled. However, there is no automatically triggered brake 
intervention by the system. It is rather that the driver is prompted to act quickly and to apply the brakes 
himself. There may be automatic brake-servo assistance during the emergency braking, as necessary. 
The brake pressure is regulated as needed for effective panic braking.

Displays 

The visual warning is given by the following warning symbols: 


Symbol 


Explanation 



Intersection warning symbol (warning of vehicle 
approaching from the left) 



Intersection warning symbol (warning of vehicle 
approaching from the right) 


The visual warning appears in the KOMBI instrument cluster or Head-Up Display if the vehicle is fitted 
with the Head-Up Display (OE 610). 



GOT Intersection warning: Warning symbol 


The Intersection warning is active in the speed range from approximately 15 km/h (9 mph) to 
approximately 65 km/h (40 mph). 


The Intersection warning is also switched of by selecting ALL OFF. There is no separate deactivation 
or configuration option in the Drive menu for the Intersection warning. 


A_ 

The Intersection warning system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly 
judging the visibility and traffic situation. The driver's driving style should be adapted to the traffic 
conditions. The driver should check the traffic conditions, and react accordingly if required.

12. Intersection Warning 

12.2. Limits of the system 

The function of the Intersection warning may be restricted because of system limits or unfavorable 
conditions in the following situations, for example: 

• If there are other objects in the field of view of the sensors that are concealing the cross traffic. 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• If the front bumper is dirty or iced up. 

• If stickers have been attached near the radar sensors on the bumper. 

• If the speed of the approaching vehicle is very high. 

• If crossing objects are moving very slowly. 

• If it is almost impossible to detect the crossing traffic because of the way the road runs or 
topographical conditions, for example in tight bends, building complexes in the way etc. 


A_ 

The system does not replace the personal assessment of the road and the traffic situation. The 
Intersection warning is only intended to assist the driver. There can be functional limitations because 
of system restrictions or unfavorable topographical conditions.

13. Road Sign Recognition 

The Speed Limit Information optional equipment has been expanded to include the display of no 
overtaking signs and will be referred to as Road Sign Recognition from now on in this document. 
Current speed limit signs are detected by the road sign recognition system and displayed in the 
instrument cluster or the Head-Up Display in the form of road sign symbols.

Road sign recognition (example: a detected top speed limitation is displayed) 


Road sign recognition (Speed Limit Information) is part of the Active Driving Assistant optional 
equipment (OE 5AS) in the G01. 

A 

The system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the visibility and 
traffic situation. The driver is solely responsible for the vehicle and the speed at which it is driven. 


13.1. Operation 

The road sign detection can be switched on and off via the iDrive menu by making the following 
selection via the controller: 

• "My Vehicle" 

• "System settings" 

• "Displays" 

• "Instrument cluster" 

• Apply desired settings 


48 









G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

13. Road Sign Recognition 

13.2. Limits of the system 

Road signs for top speed limitations that do not comply with the legal standard, particularly those 
without circular frames, are not always detected. The same also applies for road signs which are fully 
or partially covered by labels, dirt or vegetation. Long distances to the road sign, high driving speeds 
and poor weather conditions, particularly at night, make it more difficult for the system to recognize 
road signs reliably. To ensure the current top speed limitations are displayed as accurately as possible, 
the data of the navigation road map should be up-to-date. 

The functionality of the road sign recognition may be impaired in the following situations and may lead 
to incorrect information being displayed: 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• If signs are covered by objects. 

• If driving at close proximity to a vehicle driving ahead. 

• Strong light in the camera lens. 

• If the windscreen in front of the interior mirror is misted over, soiled or covered by stickers, etc. 

• As a result of incorrect detection by the camera. 

• If the top speed limitations stored in the navigation system are incorrect. 

• In areas not covered by the navigation system. 

• In the event of deviations from the navigation, e.g. due to modified road layouts. 

• When overtaking buses or trucks with speed limit stickers. 

• If road signs do not correspond to the standard. 

• When calibrating the camera immediately after vehicle delivery. 


A 

The system does not replace the personal assessment of the traffic situation. Due to system 
restrictions and functional limitations, it may transpire that warnings and orders are not issued, are 
issued too late or are unwarranted. The road sign recognition supports the driver and does not replace 
the human eye.

15. Fatigue and Focus Alert 

The Fatigue and Focus Alert helps to avoid accidents caused by tiredness on long, monotonous 
journeys. It is part of the Active Protection (OE 5AL) includedas standard equipment. 

A change in the driver's driving behavior is perceived by the attentiveness assistant. In the event 
of increasing inattentiveness or if the driver is tired, the Fatigue and Focus Alert shows a display 
recommending that the driver take a break as a Check Control message in the Central Information 
Display (CID). 

The Fatigue and Focus Alert is automatically active after each engine start from a speed of roughly 
70 km/h (43 mph). 


15.1. Operation 

The Fatigue and Focus Alert can be switched on and off via the iDrive menu. The driver can also set 
the level of sensitivity in this menu by making the following selection via the controller:

models up to now). 

"Off" 

A break recommendation is not issued. 


15.2. Limits of the system 

The functionality may be impaired in the following situations and no warning or an incorrect warning 
may be issued: 

• If the clock is set incorrectly. 

• If the speed is predominantly below approximately 70 km/h (43 mph). 

• If the driver adopts a sporty driving style, for example rapid acceleration or fast cornering. 

• In active driving situations, for example frequent lane changes. 

• Poor road condition. 

• Strong crosswind.

16. Cameras 


The camera systems provide support for parking, manoeuvring and for complex exits and 
Intersections. 

The product strategy in relation to the camera systems was adopted from the G30. With the exception 
of the rear view camera (country-dependent), the systems are no longer available as individual items of 
optional equipment. 

The new range strategy now looks like this: 

• The rear view camera is now standard. 

• Surround View is offered with the Parking Assistant optional equipment (OE ZX3). The 
Surround View function with Top View, Panorama View and 3D View provides visibility 360° 
around the vehicle. 

• The Remote 3D view (remote 360°) is presented for the first time with the Parking Assistant 
optional equipment (OE 5DN). This function allows the customer to display images of his 
parked vehicle on a mobile device (such as a smartphone). 


16.1. Surround view 

Surround View shows the vehicle surroundings and displays them in TOP View and 3D View on the 
Central Information Display. 

The system comprises the front camera, the two cameras integrated in the exterior mirrors, the rear 
view camera (RFK) and the top rear side view camera (TRSVC) control unit. 

The images from the four cameras are combined into a panorama view around the vehicle from 
different angles using 3D computer graphics. 

The driver can choose from preset views or can freely select the view (for example towbar zoom and 
car wash entrances). 

In addition, assistance functions such as guidance lines can be shown on the Central Information 
Display. 

The following camera angles can be displayed: 

• Automatic camera angle 

• Side view 

• Front camera 

• Panorama View 

• Rear view camera 

• Moving camera angle 


54 




G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

16. Cameras 

16.1.1. Automatic camera angle 

The system automatically shows the most appropriate camera angle depending on the driving 
situation, thus providing the driver with optimum assistance when parking and manoeuvring. The 
automatic camera angle shows a steering-dependent view and takes into account the respective 
direction of travel and the distance information from the Park Distance Control (PDC). 

As soon as obstacles are detected, the view changes to a fixed display of the area in front of or behind 
the vehicle, or changes to the corresponding side view if required. 


16.1.2. Side view 

This view helps the driver to position the vehicle next to the curb or other obstacles at the side 
of the vehicle by displaying the side surroundings. The side view is from the rear to the front and 
automatically focuses on potential obstacles if there is a collision risk. 

Both the left and right sides of the vehicle are recorded. 

16.1.3. Front camera 

The front camera supports the driver when parking and manoeuvring. The area in front of the vehicle 
is recorded by the front camera and shown on the Central Information Display. The front camera view 
cannot be selected separately. The driver must select the "Auto" camera angle to view it or if desired, 
switch on the "Panorama View" function. 


16.1.4. Panorama View 

Panorama View enables the driver to see the cross traffic at blind exits and Intersections before 
proceeding and provides the driver with optimum assistance in this situation. Road users that are 
hidden by obstacles to the side of the vehicle are sometimes only seen by the driver very late or not at 
all. To improve the view, the front and rearview cameras record the lateral roadway area. Depending on 
which drive position is engaged, the front or rearview camera can be activated.

16.3.3. Side protection 

The side protection warns against obstacles at the side of the vehicle and thus supports the driver 
when parking and manoeuvring. 

To protect the sides of the vehicle from collisions with obstacles, additional obstacle markings are 
shown to the side of the vehicle on the Central Information Display if necessary. 



G01 side protection view (additional obstacle markings) 


More information on the operation of the side protection function can be found in section 18.3.3. 

16.3.4. Door opening angle 

When the vehicle is stopped and the selector lever position "P" is engaged, the maximum opening 
angle of the doors is displayed on the Central Information Display. 

If there is an obstacle near the door and it is detected by the side protection, this is marked on the 
Central Information Display. The obstacle marking display only points out objects in the area of 
the door. It is not possible for a view from the camera systems to be displayed, as the door area is 
simulated. Therefore, the driver is only informed that there is an object at the side of the vehicle; it is 
not certain that the door will definitely collide with the identified object. The driver must judge this for 
himself.

^ _ _ 

The camera systems do not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic 
situation. There is still a risk of an accident. The driver's driving style should be adapted to the traffic 
conditions. The driver should check the traffic conditions and the vehicle's surroundings by looking 
around and react accordingly if required. 


16.4. Remote View 3D 

The Remote View 3D (Remote 360°) function familiar from the G30 is used in the G01. This 
function allows the customer to display images of his parked vehicle on a mobile device (such as a 
smartphone). 

The user can send a remote request to the parked vehicle through his device. The vehicle takes 
images of its surroundings and sends these to the device where an app generates a 3D view. The view 
can be adjusted by gesture, as in the vehicle. 

The customer thus has the capability of viewing his vehicle's surroundings at any time. 

Examples: 

• What does it look like around my vehicle? 

• Who or what is near my vehicle? 

Remote View 3D is part of the Parking Assistance optional equipment (OE 5DN). 

16.4.1. Functional principle 

Surround View is a prerequisite for Remote View 3D (Remote 360°) as it includes the Top View 3D 
function. This means that the already familiar cameras are used. 

The function is sold via the Remote Services optional equipment (6AP). The BMW TeleService 
connection optional equipment (OE 6AE) is a prerequisite for the Remote Services optional equipment 
(OE 6AP). 

The Remote Services optional equipment (OE 6AP) contains a number of functions that active for 
the lifetime. Remote View 3D is, however, an exception. The function is active for 2 years following 
activation. The service expires after 2 years. In this event, the customer is notified by text and e-mail, 2 
weeks before expiry of the Remote View 3D service. 

When the service has expired, the customer has the option of activating or purchasing the function for 
a further two years through the ConnctedDrive Shop. Availability of the function can be extended as 
many times as desired via the ConnectedDrive Shop. 

Application: 

The customer should like to have an image of the area around his parked vehicle.

1 He sends a request to the BMW back end via the BMW Connected App (Remote View 3D) on his 
smartphone. 

2 Following verification of the data, the BMW back end passes the request on to the appropriate 
vehicle. The vehicle then takes four separate Surround View images using the external cameras. 
These are then sent in the top rear side view camera control unit to the Telematic Communication 
Box TCB and temporarily buffered. 



G01 Remote 3D View 

3 The images are then sent by the vehicle through the Telematic Communication Box TCB to the 
BMW back end.

G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

16. Cameras 


4 The BMW back end sends the image data and a matching encryption code to the customer's 
smartphone. Once the data has been sent to the smartphone it is deleted from the BMW back 
end. The image data received is merged to form a 360° all-round view in the smartphone. 



G01 Remote 3D View: view in the smartphone 


The 3D optical display appears once the smartphone has received all four images. 

Availability 

The system includes a function detecting any border crossing or the country in which the vehicle is 
located in order to allow a country-specific release and configuration of the Remote View 3D function 
while at the same time taking account of local laws which might possibly prohibit the use of this 
function. The function may be automatically deactivated, as appropriate. 

The driver also has the possibility of activating or deactivating the function itself via the Drive (if the 
function is supported in the country in which the vehicle is located). 

The new status is sent to the BMW back end after every change to the setting (to Remote View 3D 
deactivated, for example). The BMW back end stores the status permanently and releases or inhibits 
the function calls as appropriate on the basis of this.

17.2. Auto PDC 

On the G01, Auto PDC is activated automatically if the vehicle is approaching an object at a speed 
below approximately 5 km/h and the object is located in a collision-critical area. The Auto PDC function 
is available for both the front and rear of the vehicle. 

The automatic switch-on function when obstacles are detected can be switched on and off via iDrive. 

Further information about Auto PDC may be found in the G12 assistance systems product information 
(chapter 16.2). 


17.3. Active Park Distance Control 

In G01 vehicles with the Parking Assistant (OE 5DM) or Parking Assistance (OE 5DN) optional 
equipment, the Park Distance Control PDC function has been extended to include the active Park

Further information about the active Park Distance Control function may be found in the G12 
assistance systems product information (chapter 16.3). 


17.4. Side protection 

The side protection warns against obstacles at the side of the vehicle and thus supports the driver 
when parking and manoeuvring. 



G01 Side protection 


Vehicles with the Parking Assistant (OE 5DM) optional equipment have side protection. 

Obstacles detected by the four side ultrasonic sensors integrated in the bumpers can be displayed by 
the Park Distance Control system.

17. Park Distance Control 


17.4.1. Functional principle 

Four side ultrasonic sensors, two integrated in the front bumper and two integrated in the rear bumper, 
measure the distance to an obstruction. Obstructions detected by the sensors are tracked along the 
side of the vehicle as it moves. They are shown on the Central Information Display and, in situations 
where a collision is imminent, an acoustic warning also sounds. 



G01 side protection view on the CID 


Obstructions approaching the stationary vehicle are not taken into account, as in this case the system 
cannot evaluate the situation unequivocally. The prerequisite for identifying obstructions is that the 
(driver's) vehicle is moving. 

The distance markings shown on the Central Information Display are displayed for approximately 
13 seconds once the vehicle has stopped. The markings are only shown again once the vehicle starts 
moving. 


17.5. Operation 

The Park Distance Control system is enabled in the following situations: 

• if drive position R reverse gear are engaged when driving readiness is switched on. 

• if the parking assistance button in the switch block next to the controller is pressed when 
driving readiness is switched on. 

• Auto PDC is activated and all conditions for automatic activation are given.

Further information about the operating concept for Auto PDC, the Active Park Distance Control 
function and acoustic signal output may be found in the G12 assistance systems product information 
(chapter 16.5.1-16.5.3). 


17.6. Deactivation criteria 

Similar to other BMW models, the deactivation is distance-/speed-based. The switch-off is effected 
after a journey of approximately 50 m or at a speed over 36 km/h. 

If a fault develops, a Check Control message ("PDC has malfunctioned. Have system checked.") is 
displayed in the Central Information Display (CID). In addition, the detection range of the sensors is 
shown shaded in the Central Information Display (CID). 


76 






G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

17. Park Distance Control 

17.7. Limits of the system 

Due to the physical limits during the ultrasonic measurement, obstructions may not be detected by the 
Park Distance Control system. Several examples of this are shown below: 

• If the objects are thin or wedge-shaped. 

• When the objects are low. 

• When objects that, due to their shape, have corners and sharp edges. 

• With snow. 

• If the objects have a porous surface. 

A warning may also be displayed although there is no obstruction in the detection range. This may be 
the case in the following situations: 

• When it is raining heavily. 

• If the sensors are heavily soiled or iced over. 

• If the sensors are covered with snow. 

• If the street surface is rough. 

• If there are bumps, e.g. speed bumps. 

• In large right-angled buildings with smooth walls, e.g. underground car parks. 

• Due to heavy exhaust gas fumes. 

• Due to other ultrasound sources. 

To ensure the ultrasonic sensors remain fully operational, they must be kept clean and free of ice. 

When cleaning the sensors using a high pressure cleaner, avoid direct and sustained contact with a 
high-pressure water jet. Furthermore, when using high pressure cleaners, a distance of at least 30 cm 
from the sensors must be maintained. 

A_ 

The Park Distance Control cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the traffic situation. Also 
check the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking around, otherwise there may be a risk of an 
accident as a result of road users or objects which lie outside the detection range of the Park Distance 
Control. Loud sound sources outside and inside the vehicle could drown out the PDC signal.

18. Hazard Preview 


The "hazard preview" function is presented for the first time with the introduction of the G01. The 
function transmits additional traffic information to the driver and therefore contributes to a better traffic 
flow and greater safety on the road. 

The "hazard preview" function makes information using the BMW vehicle fleet. 


18.1. Functional principle 

BMW vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors which detect the vehicle surroundings as well as 
assistance systems which warn the driver if necessary or support him in performing his driving tasks. 

In the past, however, the systems analyses each vehicle on its own. 

For a long time now, BMW has been conducting work in the field of so-called Car-to-X-Communication 
(car-to-infrastructure). The first step in this area was Real Time Traffic Information (RTTI). If there are 
no position changes of several vehicles in a certain period, this means that there is most probably a 
traffic jam situation. 

Like Real Time Traffic Information (RTTI), "hazard preview" also uses this premise as a basis and 
evaluates the available information for following traffic. 

Data is collected by means of the BMW vehicle fleet and forwarded to the BMW back end. In this 
way, vehicles that skid on slippery roads for example, can supply valuable information via the "hazard 
preview" function. The collected transmitted data is then processed in the BMW back end. Existing 
local danger warnings are then transmitted to the following vehicles via Real Time Traffic Information 
(RTTI). 


18.2. Warning situation 

The following hazard situations are taken into account: 



Heavy rain 



Slippery road 


78 




G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

18. Hazard Preview 



Breakdowns 

The system will also create disabled vehicle warnings from automatic ecalls and manual ecalls that are 
serious (carriage way blocked initiated by automatic ecall or from the agent during a manual ecall). 

The following graphic shows different situations in which a warning would be issued via the hazard 
preview function: 



GO! Hazard preview 


1 BMW vehicles that are in a danger situation send information corresponding to this situation to 
the BMW back end. 

2 After this data has been processed, the information is sent to the data services provider for 
verification. 

3 Finally, the BMW back end transmits the danger warning to following vehicles, for example. 

The "hazard preview" function makes it possible to achieve a significant increase in quality through the 
enhanced up-to-dateness of existing local danger warnings. 


79 




















G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

19. Cross Traffic Alert 


The Cross Traffic Alert was used for the first time in the G12. This warning assists the driver when 
manoeuvring out of a parking space and in other everyday situations where it is difficult to see the 
traffic, such as at blind entrances and exits. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, the Cross Traffic Alert is available in the G01 for rear or also for 
the front. 

The system can detect objects that are approaching the vehicle from the side, either from the front or 
rear (depending on the vehicle equipment). The driver is made aware of or warned of crossing traffic 
by the Cross Traffic Alert function when manoeuvring out of a parking space or entering the crossing 
traffic. 


19.1. Functional principle 

If a moving object is detected, which based on the current speed would be in the area in front of or 
behind the vehicle in approximately the next two seconds, a visual and acoustic warning is issued. 

When a rear Cross Traffic Alert is issued, the LED in the mirror glass is also switched on. The lane 
change warning signal unit is used as an indicator. The indicator is switched on in either the left or right 
mirror depending on the direction from which the object is approaching the vehicle. 

The Cross Traffic Alert works up to a speed of approximately 7 km/h (4 mph). Another prerequisite of 
the function is that the side radar sensors are able to detect the road or approaching object. The radar 
sensors can detect objects up to a maximum of 80 m (262 feetjaway from the vehicle. 


19.2. Cross Traffic Alert Rear 



G01 Cross Traffic Alert rear: manoeuvring out of a parking space 


The rear Cross Traffic Alert assists the driver when reversing out of a parking space and warns of 
potential collisions with cross traffic in traffic situations where it is difficult to see obstructions. 

The rear Cross Traffic Alert is included in the Active Driving Assistant optional equipment (OE 5AS) 
scope of supply. 


80

19. Cross Traffic Alert 


The warning is displayed in the Park Distance Control image on the Central Information Display. 

Using the rear view camera, the rear Cross Traffic Alert will be extended to include an additional display 
on the Central Information Display. The warning will be shown in the form of a red bar in the camera's 
video screen. 

The rear Cross Traffic Alert is enabled if the driver engages the "R" drive position or the Park Distance 
Control is active. 

In vehicles with the Parking Assistance Plus optional equipment (OE 5DN), the rear Cross Traffic Alert 
is also enabled if Panorama View has been activated. 

The rear Cross Traffic Alert is available at speeds up to approximately 7 km/h (4 mph). 


19.3. Cross Traffic Alert Front 



G01 Example of Cross Traffic Alert at the front: manoeuvring out of a parking space 


The front Cross Traffic Alert assists the driver when entering the cross traffic from exits and blind 
Intersections. 

The front Cross Traffic Alert is included in the Active Driving Assistant Plus Package optional 
equipment (OE 5AT) scope of supply. If the Cross Traffic Alert for the front of the vehicle is installed, 
the rear version is activated automatically. 

The warning is displayed in the Park Distance Control image on the Central Information Display. 

The front Cross Traffic Alert is enabled if the Park Distance Control is active and the speed of the 
vehicle does not exceed approximately 7 km/h (4 mph). 

In vehicles with the Parking Assistance Plus optional equipment (OE 5DN), the front Cross Traffic Alert 
is also enabled if Panorama View has been activated. 

Like the rear Cross Traffic Alert, the front Cross Traffic Alert function is available at speeds from to 
approximately 7 km/h (4 mph).

The Cross Traffic Alert is deactivated automatically in the following situations: 


If the driver's vehicle is travelling at a speed higher than walking speed with a threshold value 
approximately 7 km/h (4 mph). 

If the steering and lane control assistant is active. 

If the driver is currently parking using the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant 


19.6. Limits of the system 

The function may be restricted in the following situations: 

• If there are other objects in the field of view of the sensors that are concealing the cross traffic. 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• If the bumper is dirty or iced over. 

• If stickers have been attached near the radar sensors on the bumper.

20. Parking Manoeuvring Assistant 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant PMA supports the driver in many ways. The assistant measures 
the size of a gap between cars and decides based on the result whether the gap is large enough on the 
one hand and relieves the driver of the task of manoeuvring into the space on the other. 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant PMA (OE 5DN) is no longer available as an individual item of 
optional equipment. 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant PMA is included in the Parking Assistant Package optional 
equipment (OE ZPK) or the Executive Package (OE ZPX) in the G01. 


20.1. Parallel parking/perpendicular parking 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant function facilitates manoeuvring into parking spaces that are 
parallel (parallel parking) and perpendicular (bay parking) to the roadway.

• The distance from an obstruction is measured by four ultrasonic sensors in the rear bumper 
panel and four additional ultrasonic sensors in the front bumper panel (positions 1 and 9). 

• Two additional ultrasonic sensors are installed in the rear bumper to precisely detect the size 
of a transverse parking space during the parking maneuver. The additional ultrasonic sensors 
measure the distance to detected objects.

20.4. Functional principle 

The system measures potential parking spaces when driving past at a speed below approximately 
35 km/h (21 mph) even without the system having been activated. 

The parking spaces are measured by two additional ultrasonic sensors, which are integrated into 
the front wheel arch. Two additional ultrasonic sensors are installed in the rear bumper in the G01 to 
precisely detect the size of a perpendicular parking space during the parking maneuver. The additional 
ultrasonic sensors measure the distance to detected objects. 


89 














G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

20. Parking Manoeuvring Assistant 

The four sensors are connected to the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) control unit, which also 
incorporates the Park Distance Control function. The function of the four ultrasonic sensors is similar 
to that of the Park Distance Control (PDC). Ultrasonic pulses are sent and echo impulses are received. 

If a parking space of a sufficient length and width is found and the system is activated, the driver is 
shown the space on the Central Information Display. 

When searching for a parking space and when parking, all relevant information is presented to the 
driver in an integrated display; from the parking space itself to the status of the parking assistant and 
corresponding handling instructions through to distances from other objects. 

The driver is still responsible for monitoring the vehicle environment and can intervene in the 
automatic parking maneuver at any time if required due to the vehicle environment. 

20.4.1. Automatic transmission 

Once the system is activated the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant PMA takes over complete control of 
the vehicle including steering, braking and gear selection. 

20.4.2. Personal responsibility 

• Directly monitor the parking space and parking procedure and intervene if necessary, as 
otherwise there is a risk of accidents. 

• If a parking space that has already been measured changes, the system does not take this into 
account. 

• The system does not take loads that project above the vehicle into account during parking. 

• The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant PMA may steer the vehicle over or up onto curbs. You 
should therefore use the facility for active intervention at any time with caution as you may 
otherwise damage wheels and tires or the vehicle itself. 


A 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant PMA does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility during 
parking. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is 
a risk of an accident. 


20.5. Functional prerequisites 

To use the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant function, the following basic prerequisites must be met: 

• The doors must be closed. 

• The tailgate must be closed. 

• The driver's seat belt must be fastened. 

• The parking brake must be released.

20.5.1. Measuring parking spaces 

Parking spaces are measured while driving. The following parameters apply: 

• Driving forwards straight-ahead up to approximately 35 km/h (21 mph) 

• Maximum distance to the row of parked vehicles: 1,5 m. 


Detecting the curb 

If a curb is detected within the range of the ultrasonic sensor while the system is searching for a 
parking space, the parking space is for the most a space that is parallel to the road. 

In the case of parking spaces that are perpendicular to the roadway, the curb is usually outside the 
detection range of the ultrasonic sensors (range approximately 4.2 m (14 feet).

20.5.4. Detection of a universal parking space 

Due to the technical system limits, the vehicle does not always detect the correct parking space. 
Situations may occur where parking spaces are wrongly detected, or parking spaces that are 
unsuitable or not actually classed as parking spaces are detected. 

The below graphic shows a situation where this may be the case. 



G01 detection of a universal parking space 

The detected parking space is big enough to park the vehicle in both perpendicularly and parallel to 
the roadway. Because of the absence of a curb, the vehicle cannot correctly determine the parking 
space. The vehicle proposes a universal parking space. In this case, the driver must decide how 
he wants to maneuver into the parking space. For this purpose, a selection window is displayed in 
the Central Information Display (CID) with corresponding information. The driver can then make a 
selection by means of the controller. 

Additional information on parking spaces suitable for the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant may be found 
in the ST1501 G12 Driver Assistance Systems product information.

20.6.1. Park procedure 

As soon as a parking space is found, the driver is instructed to stop the vehicle and confirm the parking 
space by using the turn indicator corresponding to the parking direction. During the entire parking 
procedure, the driver receives further instructions that guide him though the entire parking procedure 
with the support of the system. 

Vehicles with automatic transmission 

The driver is prompted to take his hands from the steering wheel during automatic parking and hold 
down the parking assistance button until the parking procedure is complete. 

20.6.2. Deactivation criteria 

Manual deactivation criteria 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) can be deactivated at any time if necessary by the driver 
via the controller by selecting the corresponding symbol in the symbol bar on the Central Information 
Display (CID). Another way to deactivate the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) is to release the 
parking assistance button in the switch block next to the iDrive controller. 

If a fault develops, a Check Control message ("The PDC has malfunctioned. Have system checked.") is 
displayed in the Central Information Display (CID). 

Automatic deactivation criteria 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) is switched off automatically when the following events 
occur: 


• The parking assistance button is released 

• The driver holds on to the steering wheel or steers himself 

• A gear is selected that does not correspond to the instruction on the control display 

• When accelerating 

• The parking brake is secured 

• The turn indicator opposite the required parking side is switched on 

• At speeds above approximately 10 km/h (6 mph) 

• Possibly on snow-covered or slippery roads 

• The tailgate is open 

• Possibly if there are objects which are difficult to overcome, e.g. curbs 

• If obstructions suddenly appear 

• A maximum number of parking maneuvers or the parking duration has been exceeded. 


95 




G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

20. Parking Manoeuvring Assistant 

20.7. Limits of the system 

The detection of objects can test the ultrasonic measurement system to its limits. Several examples of 
this are shown below: 

• With trailer towbars and couplings. 

• If the objects are thin or wedge-shaped. 

• If the objects are projecting and elevated, e.g. wall projections or loads. 

• If the objects have corners and sharp edges. 

• If the objects have fine surfaces or structures, e.g. fences. 

Low objects that are already displayed, e.g. curbs, may fall within the blind spot of the sensors before 
or after a continuous alarm sounds. It would not be possible to detect objects that are higher up and 
projecting, e.g. wall projections. Parking spaces may be detected although these are not suitable. 

There may be other functional limitations in the following situations, for example: 

• If the sensors are soiled or iced up. 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow. 

• On uneven surfaces, e.g. gravel roads. 

• On slippery surfaces. 

• On steep inclines or downhill gradients. 

• If leaves have gathered or snow has piled up in the parking space. 

To ensure the ultrasonic sensors remain fully operational, they must be kept clean and free of ice. 

When cleaning the sensors using a high pressure cleaner, avoid direct and sustained contact with a 
high-pressure water jet. Furthermore, when using high pressure cleaners, a distance of at least 30 cm 
from the sensors must be maintained. 

A_ 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the 
traffic situation. Also check the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking around, otherwise there 
may be a risk of an accident as a result of road users or objects which lie outside the detection range of 
the Park Distance Control. Loud sound sources outside and inside the vehicle may mask the acoustic 
signals of the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) or the Park Distance Control (PDC).

21. Cruise Control 

21.1. Introduction 

Two cruise control system are available in the G01. The cruise control with braking function (DCC) is 
part of the standard equipment. 

The customer also has the option of ordering the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function 
(ACC Stop&Go) optional equipment (OE 5DF). 

ACC Stop&Go can also be obtained if the customer opts for the Active Driving Assistant Plus Package 
optional equipment (OE ZDB), as it is contained in this equipment package. 

The active cruise control with Stop&Go function, ACC Stop&Go (OE 5DF) and the Active Driving 
Assistant Plus Package (OE ZDB) optional equipment require the navigation system Professional 
(OE 609) optional equipment. 

A 

The cruise control systems support the driver with adapting the speed, distance and driving style to 
the traffic conditions, but do not relieve him of his responsibility. The driver must actively intervene, 
e.g. by braking, steering or taking evasive action, as otherwise there is a risk of an accident. 


21.2. Cruise control with braking function 

The cruise control with braking function is included as part of the G01 's standard equipment. The 
system is also Known as "Dynamic Cruise Control" (DCC). Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) supports 
the driver on roads with less traffic by keeping the speed constant irrespective of rolling resistances 
(incline, downhill driving and vehicle load). In spite of the support, the driver remains responsible for 
control of the vehicle. It is possible to override the DCC function at any time by braking or accelerating 
the vehicle. 


21.2.1. Operation 

The driver has the option of adjusting the set speed in small or large increments, which is then set and 
maintained by the system by controlling the drive and brakes. It can be changed using the left-hand 
switch block on the multifunction steering wheel (MFL). The speed is increased or reduced by 1 km/ 
h (1 mph) by tapping the rocker switch. Each time the rocker button is pressed beyond the pressure 
point, the speed increases or reduces by 10 km/h (6 mph). The DCC steadily maintains a selected 
speed from approximately 30 km/h (18 mph). 

The set speed is indicated in the instrument cluster in the familiar way; by a mark that moves round the 
speed reading. Notes are added to the displays in the instrument cluster if necessary. 

If the vehicle's own deceleration is not sufficient to maintain the preset speed, the brake is activated 
accordingly. 

If ECO PRO or SPORT mode is activated, cruise control is also set to a fuel-efficient or sporty driving 
style. Due to the fuel-efficient driving style in ECO PRO driving mode, in some situations the vehicle's 
speed may exceed or drop below the set speed, for example on downhill gradients or inclines.

21.3. Active speed control with Stop&Go function 

The active cruise control with Stop&Go function, ACC Stop&Go (OE 5DF) is offered as optional 
equipment for the G01. 

ACC Stop&Go adjusts a driver-specified set speed and, if required by the traffic situation, also 
automatically adjusts the preselected following distance to the vehicle driving ahead (detected 
vehicles include passenger cars, trucks and motorbikes). The application range of ACC Stop&Go 
ranges from higher speeds down to a standstill. The distance and the speed are automatically adjusted 
in this range.

GO! Active Cruise Control (ACC) Stop&Go 


Depending on the stationary time, driving off from a standstill is performed automatically or in 
response to a prompt by the driver. ACC Stop&Go not only detects vehicles that are slowly coming to a 
halt, but also stationary vehicles. 

Due to improved monitoring in front of the vehicle, the system is capable of reacting more quickly to 
vehicles swinging in and out and turning off. 

The extended application range has been achieved by the incorporation of the KAFAS stereo camera. 
Image data is evaluated by the ACC Stop&Go system. The KAFAS control unit clearly detects vehicles 
when their rear ends are recorded by the camera. In addition, the KAFAS control unit ensures that the 
driving lane information, vehicle positions and movements are determined.

G01 Radar sensor/KAFAS stereo camera fusion: KAFAS stereo camera object detection 


In addition to image data, radar data is also gathered and evaluated by the radar sensors. This fusion 
of image and radar data makes possible the clear identification of lane markings and the distinction 
between stationary vehicles and other fixed objects.

G01 Radar sensor/KAFAS stereo camera fusion: Radar sensor object detection 


A 77 GHz radar sensor emits bundled electromagnetic waves. The echoes reflected by objects are 
received and evaluated by the radar sensor. This enables information about objects located in front 
of the radar sensor to be obtained. This information includes size, distance and the deduced speed. 
The system's radar sensor can identify vehicles ahead up to a distance of 200 m (650 feet), to a large 
extent irrespective of weather conditions. 

The sensor is located behind the air inlet grille on the front bumper.

Sensor for ACC Stop & Go 


Thanks to the radar sensor's improved detection capability and alignment with the image data from 
the KAFAS stereo camera, vehicles in neighboring lanes are also detected. If these vehicles are driving 
in their own lane, then ACC Stop&Go adapts the speed to the vehicle pulling in or vehicle ahead. As a 
result, a time lag selected by the driver is constantly maintained. 

ACC Stop&Go adjusts the speed if there is no vehicle driving directly ahead and automatically 
switches to distance control if the sensor system detects a slower vehicle in its lane. The system's 
Stop & Go function brings the vehicle to a complete standstill if necessary. 

Detecting the vehicle in front of the vehicle in front 

This is analysed using the sensors already fitted. Object detection is based on a fusion of the front 
radar sensor and the KAFAS stereo camera. Both sensors are, in principle, capable of detecting a 
vehicle in front of the vehicle in front. 

In most cases, the vehicle in front of the vehicle in front is, however, concealed by the vehicle in front, 
which is why the camera can generally not detect it. The front radar, however, consistently provides 
good detection quality here by 'looking under' the vehicle in front. 

The advantages of this are as follows: 

• Improved "driver-like" speed governing behavior. 

• Smoother following driving (“ACC cruising”). 

• Enhanced dynamics for traffic light-controlled journeys. 

• Driver-like behavior when approaching distant objects. 


102 






G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

21. Cruise Control 


Evaluation of ultrasound data 

Since both the front radar sensor and the KAFAS stereo camera are only of limited use for near-range 
monitoring, the ultrasonic data for the ACC Stop&Go system is evaluated for the first time. The data 
is provided by the front ultrasonic sensors already described. These are needed to monitor the close 
range in front of the vehicle for freedom from obstacles. 

Coupling to the navigation system 

Improved cornering behavior is made possible by coupling ACC Stop&Go to the navigation system. 
This contributes to a further improvement of driver-like behaviour. This also takes into consideration 
the intention to turn off the road and intersections, among other aspects. 

Restart time 

The restart time after automatic braking to a stop by ACC Stop&Go of previously approximately 
3 seconds has also been increased to approximately 30 seconds on the G01. 

A 

If the vehicle in front starts driving again after being stopped (for more than approximately 3 seconds or 
longer than approximately 30 seconds, a note is shown to the driver. To drive off again the driver must 
confirm this note, by pressing the RES/CNCL button or the accelerator pedal. 


Additional convenience is provided by the extended restart time without driver intervention. 

ACC Stop & Go does not only support the driver in flowing traffic, but also in traffic jam situations, both 
on multiple-lane roadways and ordinary roads. 

The adjustment range for the set speed is limited to a maximum of 210 km/h (130 mph). 

If ECO PRO or SPORT mode is activated, the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function is also 
set to a fuel-efficient or sporty driving style. Due to the fuel-efficient driving style in ECO PRO driving 
mode, in some situations the vehicle's speed may exceed or drop below the set speed, for example on 
downhill gradients or inclines. 

21.3.1. Operation 

Activation and deactivation 

The activation and deactivation of the ACC Stop & Go and the Dynamic Cruise Control are almost the 
same. ACC Stop&Go can either be activated while driving or at a standstill. For safety reasons, when 
the vehicle is at a standstill the function can only be put in Standby mode or deactivated while the foot 
brake is applied. 

If the function is active, it can be interrupted by pressing the RES/CNCL button. The distance and 
speed will no longer be maintained and the set speed is greyed out in the instrument cluster. 

The driver can select a desired distance in four stages using the left-hand multifunction button on the 
multifunction steering wheel (MFL). The following distance most recently selected is saved depending 
on the key being used.

• If the brakes are used. 

• If the selector lever position is moved out of position "D". 

• If the Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) is activated or the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is

• If the seat belt is unfastened and the driver's door is opened in a stationary vehicle. 

• If the system has not detected an object for a long time, e.g. on rarely frequented sections of 
road with no distinct edge. 

• If the detection range of the radar is impaired, e.g. due to contamination or heavy precipitation. 

• Following a longer immobilization period, if the vehicle has been decelerated to a standstill by 
ACC Stop&Go. 

The set speed is indicated in the instrument cluster in the familiar way; by a mark that moves round 
the speed reading. If ACC Stop&Go is activated, this mark is green, whereas in "Standby" mode it is 
grey and the last set speed is displayed. After the ACC Stop&Go function is activated or after the driver 
has adjusted the set speed, the current digital value is displayed. If the distance is changed, a symbol 
appears briefly as an acknowledgement. The symbol screen masks are for example the set speed and 
the distance bar. With each subsequent operation the display is shown for another three seconds. 

The distances set by the driver, as well as the distances to any vehicles driving ahead, that must be 
maintained to ensure a safe distance are displayed between the two round instruments (speed reading 
and engine speed display). The distance setting is stored for the ID transmitter currently being used. 
Like for DCC, it is also necessary that the symbol screen masks are complemented if necessary with 
notes in the instrument cluster for ACC Stop & Go. 

With active control the displays are also shown in the Head-Up Display (optional equipment OE 610). 

If the system can no longer adjust a safe distance, for example due to very high differential speeds, 
then the driver is prompted to take over the vehicle handling by a flashing red vehicle symbol and an 
acoustic signal.

The traffic jam assistant was first introduced in the 101. This increased the speed range in which the 
system can be used from 40 km/h (24 mph) to 60 km/h (37 mph). 

The steering and lane control assistant and Active Lane keeping Assistant with active side collision 
protection were introduced for the first time in the G12. 

Further innovative systems were introduced with the launch of the G30. The driver of a new BMW X3 
now also has the Evasion Aid and lane change assistant at his disposal.

24. Lane Keeping & Traffic Jam Assistants 

What drivers wish for most while driving is relief from monotonous situations such as sitting in a jam 
or slow moving traffic. In addition to active cruise control with Stop&Go function (OE 5DF), drivers are 
now also supported by steering and lane control assistance. The steering and lane control assistant 
was first introduced in the G12. 

The steering and lane control assistant including traffic jam assistant is part of the Active Driving 
Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT). 

The system assists the driver in keeping the vehicle in lane by initiating corrective steering 
interventions if required. 



G01 Active steering intervention 


24.1. Functional principle 

Depending on the speed, the system is guided by the lane edges or vehicles driving ahead. The 
position of the lane edges and the vehicle driving ahead is determined with the help of five radar 
sensors and the KAFAS stereo camera.

G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

24. Lane Keeping & Traffic Jam Assistants 

The system has two subfunctions: the traffic jam assistant (second generation) and the lane control 
assistant. 

The traffic jam assistant is available for speeds up to approximately 70 km/h (43 mph), the steering and 
lane control assistant from approximately 70 km/h (43 mph)to approximately 210 km/h (130 mph). 

The table below shows an overview of the differences between the two subfunctions:

direction of the vehicle driving ahead 

Corrective steering interventions in the direction 
of the center of the lane 

Detected lane markings taken into 
consideration 

Gaps in lane markings can be bridged for a 
limited time by aligning with vehicle ahead 


If the traffic jam and lane control assistants are activated, the side collision avoidance is also 
interlinked. 


24.1.1. Hands-off-Detection 

To ensure the driver is alert and able to react, he is urged to always have both hands on the steering 
wheel when the steering and lane control assistant including traffic jam assistant are activated 
(established in the German road traffic regulations). If the driver takes both hands off the steering 
wheel rim, control is stopped after a few seconds during active control and the driver is requested to 
take over steering. 

Additional information about Hands-off-Detection may be found in the ST1501 G12 Driver 
Assistance Systems product information. 

24.1.2. Functional prerequisites 

The following prerequisites must be met in order for the steering and lane control assistant including 
traffic jam assistant to be used: 

• Speed must be below 210 km/h (130 mph). 

• Above 70 km/h (43 mph): both lane edges must be detected. 

• Below 70 km/h (43 mph): both lane edges or a vehicle driving ahead must be detected. 

• The lane width must be sufficient. 

• The vehicle should be positioned as centrally as possible in the lane. 

• There must be a sufficient curve radius. 

• At least one hand must be on the steering wheel rim. 

• The turn indicator must not be activated. 

• The camera calibration process must be completed immediately after vehicle delivery. 

The active lateral control function with data evaluation of the KAFAS stereo camera is implemented 
with the assistance of the lane markings identified on the left and right. 


115 






G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

24. Lane Keeping & Traffic Jam Assistants 

In order for the system to be activated, two lane boundary lines must be detected. Below a speed of 
approximately 70 km/h (43 mph) a vehicle driving ahead in the same lane is sufficient to activate the 
system. 

The system is put in Standby mode if the marginal conditions are not satisfied (e.g. hands not on 
steering wheel, lane too narrow or dazzling of KAFAS stereo camera). Once all marginal conditions 
have been met, the system is re-enabled automatically. 

To activate the system, the speed of the vehicle is another input quantity that is evaluated. The system 
uses these values to decide which function will be enabled. As mentioned above, the threshold values 
are set as follows: 

• The traffic jam assistant can be enabled within a speed range of 0 to approximately 70 km/h 
(43 mph). 

• The lane control assistant can be enabled within a speed range from approximately 70 km/h 
(43 mph) to approximately 210 km/h (130 mph). 


24.1.3. Lane change 

For a lane change to be as comfortable as possible, the steering and lane control assistant including 
traffic jam assistant is put silently into Standby mode when the turn indicator is activated and 
reactivates itself automatically once the turn indicator is back in its initial position and a lane change 
has occurred. 


24.1.4. Function logic 

The main function logic of the lateral guidance is implemented in the optional equipment system (SAS) 
control unit. 

The majority of the data for the function is provided by the KAFAS stereo camera, where algorithms for 
the lane and object detection run. 

Vehicle dynamics data, such as the driving speed, wheel speeds, yaw rate, steering angle, lateral 
acceleration, longitudinal acceleration, etc., is provided by the rest of the vehicle network via a FlexRay 
or CAN connection. 

A target trajectory (also known as a path curve) is calculated in the optional equipment system (SAS) 
control unit. This is used to determine whether a steering correction is required. 

24.1.5. Steering interventions 

If the current course of the vehicle deviates too much from the target trajectory (path curve), a steering 
correction is initiated. 

The steering intervention is a corrective measure. This means the driver is not relieved of his duty to 
steer the vehicle. As the corrective steering interventions are limited to approximately 1.5 m/s 2 based 
on the lateral acceleration, the system cannot navigate curves above the respective speed-dependent 
curve radius without the driver's assistance. The driver must therefore steer the vehicle at the same 
time in order to stay on the roadway. 


116 



G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

24. Lane Keeping & Traffic Jam Assistants 

The target trajectory and required steering corrections are calculated based on the driving speed as 
follows: 

Speed range 0 to 70 km/h (0 to 43 mph): 

• The position and previous movements of the vehicle driving ahead are given priority when 
determining the appropriate steering corrections. 

• Detected lane markings are taken into account to avoid unwanted steering corrections that 
would result in leaving the lane. 

• Corrective steering interventions in the direction of the center of the lane are initiated if the 
vehicle detects there is not a vehicle driving ahead. 

Speed range 70 km/h to 130 km/h (43 to 80 mph): 

• Corrective steering interventions in the direction of the center of the lane are initiated. 

• It is possible to bridge the gap for a limited time where lane markings are not detected by 
estimating the course of the lane based on the vehicle driving ahead. 

Speed range 130 km/h to 210 km/h (80 to 130 mph): 

• Corrective steering interventions in the direction of the center of the lane are initiated. 

• For safety reasons above a driving speed of approximately 130 km/h (80 mph) the course of 
the lane is not estimated using the vehicle driving ahead. 

The vehicle driving ahead is given priority as the "correction target" at speeds up to approximately 
70 km/h (43 mph) due to the limited detection of lane markings. 

In traffic jams or slow-moving traffic following distances are often extremely small (< 10 m) due to 
tailgating and lanes ahead are often partially covered due to staggered driving. 

This means the KAFAS stereo camera is unable to correctly interpret the lane markings in some cases. 

When classifying the object driving ahead, vehicles such as motorbikes are not used as the "correction 
target". 

Steering momentum 

The driving dynamics function software in the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) control unit calculates a 
target steering torque based on the curve nominal value. The target steering torque is then converted 
to an engine torque by the Electronic Power Steering (EPS), which finally results in a steering wheel 
movement at the wheels. 

The maximum steering torque has been set in such a way that it can always be overruled by the driver 
and therefore steering past the maximum steering torque is possible.

24.1.7. Deactivation criteria 

The steering and lane control assistant including traffic jam assistant is deactivated automatically in 
the following situations: 

• If the vehicle departs from the detected lane or the lane width does not meet the 
requirements. 

• If the lane edges of the current lane are not detected by the KAFAS stereo camera. 

• If no vehicle driving ahead is detected. 

• The vehicle is travelling at a speed greater than 210 km/h (130 mph). 

• If the Hands-off-Detection cannot detect the hands (at least one hand) on the steering wheel 
rim. The system is switched off once a defined time threshold (several seconds) has elapsed. 

• Due to the radius of the bend in the road, the inner lane edge is no longer detected due to the 
camera aperture angle. 

• Pedestrian protection assumes the operating condition "Fault exists". 

• If the turn indicator is on. 

• The driver intervenes actively in the steering. 

• If over a certain time period no lane edges are detected and there is not a vehicle driving 
ahead. 

• If the driver manually deactivates the DSC (DSC off). 

• If there is an intervention from the preventative pedestrian protection. 

• After Dynamic Brake Control braking (brake assistant). 


24.1.8. Limits of the system 

When driving in narrow lanes, e.g. when driving through roadworks or when emergency lanes are 
formed, the system cannot be activated or used meaningfully. 

A 

Due to the limited detection capacity of the KAFAS stereo camera, the driver must remain alert and 
observant in order to be able to actively intervene at any time so as to avoid the risk of an accident. The 
system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic situation. 
The driver is solely responsible for the vehicle.

G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

25. Active Lane Keeping Assistant 

The Active Lane keeping Assistant with active side collision protection is part of the Active Driving 
Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT). 

By making corrective steering interventions, the system, already familiar from the G12 helps the driver 
to keep the vehicle in lane at speeds from approximately 70 km/h (43 mph) to approximately 210 km/h 
(130 mph) and to actively avoid potential side collisions. The system endeavours to orient the vehicle 
in its lane according to the situation and within the framework of the system limits. 

The system consists of the following four subfunctions: 

• Side Collision Avoidance 

• Reduced Side Collision Avoidance 

• Lane Departure Warning 

• Blind Spot Detection 


25.1. Side Collision Avoidance

25.1.1. Reduced Side Collision Avoidance 

The Reduced Side Collision Avoidance comes into play if it is not possible to adequately monitor the 
available space on the roadway or there is no available space on the roadway. 

The Reduced Side Collision Avoidance is interlinked with the steering and lane control assistants 
including traffic jam assistant function.

A _ 

The Active Lane keeping Assistant with active side collision protection does not relieve the driver of 
his overall responsibility for driving the vehicle. Due to the system limits be attentive in order to be able 
to actively intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident.

26. Evasion Aid 


Often a collision with another vehicle (at the end of a tailback for example) or obstacle can only be 
prevented by an avoidance maneuver. Since the driver's response time plays a decisive role in an 
avoidance maneuver just as in a braking maneuver, the Evasion Aid is able to make a considerable 
contribution to avoiding an impending collision. 

The Evasion Aid supports the driver in such critical driving situations with a focused steering 
intervention if the driver needs to avoid an obstacle. The system also help keep the vehicle stable 
during and after the avoidance maneuver. 

This is achieved by an interaction between the Dynamic Stability Control DSC, the Electronic Power 
Steering EPS and the analysis of data from the assistance sensors. 




G01 Evasion Aid: interaction of Dynamic Stability Control DSC and Electronic Power Steering EPS 


The Evasion Aid is part of the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Plus (OE 5AT) and was 
used for the first time in the G30. 


26.1. Functional principle 

An emergency avoidance maneuver takes place when a suddenly occurring obstacle is detected in 
front of the vehicle and the driver has to avoid this obstacle quickly and without “significant” braking. 

The Evasion Aid supports the driver in avoidance maneuvers in emergency situations and calculates 
an optimum “escape track” past the obstacle. 

The “escape track” is calculated within the physical limits of the particular vehicle. The calculated 
“escape track” is designed to minimize transverse dynamics.

G01 Evasion Aid 


The vehicle is preconditions before an anticipated avoidance maneuver. 

Here all functions that contribute to stabilize the vehicle are adapted in their configuration for the 
maximum support of the driver. This can reduce the risk of unstable vehicle behavior or overloading the 
driver in an acute avoidance maneuver. 


The Evasion Aid checks the current vehicle inclination and the driver's steering wheel actions and 
compares the information with the computed “escape track”. Should the system detect discrepancies, 
an appropriate steering intervention is applied to steer the vehicle to the previously estimated “escape 
track”. 

The design objective for the system was that the driver's selected steering is not bypassed, but 
instead the haptics of steering wheel use are modified. The driver is supported by an additional 
support torque in the Electronic Power Steering (EPS) for the avoidance maneuver. 


If a collision-threatening situation is detected and an acute warning has been issued, the Evasion Aid 
evaluates the traffic situation. 


125 










G01 Driver Assistance Systems 

26. Evasion Aid 


The possible free space for an avoidance maneuver is analyzed on the basis of this critical situation. 
Radar sensors and the KAFAS stereo camera here monitor the vehicle's surroundings. The system can 
intervene to provide support if an avoidance opportunity next to the vehicle in front is available and if 
no collision object has been detected to the side of the own vehicle. 

The system assists the driver in the speed range from 40 km/h to 160 km/h (25 mph - 100 mph). 

The driver initiates the avoidance maneuver by turning the steering wheel rapidly, at the same time 
determining the avoiding direction. Any brake intervention initiated by the acute warning is aborted or 
suppressed as appropriate. The Electronic Power Steering (EPS) implements a supporting steering 
intervention. 

The vehicle is made “more agile” by the system as it steers around the obstacle and then stabilized 
again when it reaches the escape lane. 

Rapid and effective avoidance is possible thanks to the vehicle's improved response to steering 
commands, without, however, endangering the general driving stability.

The hard shoulder may be used as the escape lane, in addition to a normal lane. 

A_ 

The supporting steering intervention by the system is not performed until after the driver has actively 
initiated the avoidance maneuver. An avoidance maneuver by the Evasion Aid alone is thus not 
performed. The driver must likewise determine the direction of the avoidance.

26.2. System overview 

Below we describe which main components or sensors are relevant to the Evasion Aid. 

• Object or obstacles are detected by means of the KAFAS stereo camera and the ACC 
Stop&Go front radar sensor. 

• The four side radar sensors monitor the area around the vehicle. The data from the KAFAS 
stereo camera is also analyzed and in this way a possible free space for an avoidance 
maneuver can be identified. 

• A target trajectory (also known as a path curve), that is the “escape track” itself, is calculated in 
the Optional Equipment System (SAS) control unit. 

• The driving dynamics function software in the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) control unit 
calculates a target steering torque based on the “escape track”. 

• The target steering torque is converted to an engine torque by the Electronic Power Steering 
(EPS), which finally results a supporting steering intervention if necessary. 

The maximum steering torque has been set in such a way that it can always be overruled by 
the driver and therefore steering past the maximum steering torque is possible.

26.3. Operation 

A special precondition such as the individual configuration capability for the system or deactivation of 
this function only is not possible. 

The Evasion Aid can only be deactivated by switching off all Intelligent Safety systems (ALL OFF). 

A_ 

The system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic 
situation. The driver is solely responsible for the vehicle. 


26.4. Functional prerequisites 

The Evasion Aid is not linked to a particular road type. 

The following basis parameters are the prerequisites for the availability of the Evasion Aid: 

• The vehicle's speed must not be below approximately 40 km/h (25 mph) and be no higher than 
approximately 160 km/h (100 mph). 

• The system must have identified a free space for an avoidance maneuver. 

The Evasion Aid is generally not available in the following cases: 

• The vehicle's speed is below approximately 40 km/h (25 mph) or higher than approximately 
160 km/h (100 mph). 

• During a dynamic overtaking maneuver initiated by the driver. 

• If the Dynamic Stability Control has been switched off by the driver, or there is a fault in the 
DSC. 

• When all Intelligent Safety systems are switched off. 

• In the event of systemic limitations of the radar sensors or the KAFAS stereo camera.

26.5. Limits of the system 

The collision warning has a limited capacity for detection. As a result, incorrect or delayed warnings 
may occur and consequently the Evasion Aid is limited in its operation. It is also possible that the 
following vehicles are not detected: 

• A slow vehicle when driving off at high speed. 

• Vehicles that suddenly swerve or decelerate rapidly. 

• Vehicles with an unusual rear view or with insufficiently visible rear lights. 

• Partially concealed vehicles. 

• Two-wheeled vehicles travelling ahead. 

The function of the KAFAS stereo camera and the radar sensors, and thus also the function of the 
Evasion Aid may be impaired in the following situations, for example: 

• Heavy fog, rain, spray or snow. 

• Insufficient light. 

• Strong light in the camera lens. 

• If the field of view of the KAFAS stereo camera or the windscreen is dirty. 

• On sharp bends. 

• Up to 10 seconds after engine start via the START-STOP button. 

• On restriction or deactivation of the driving dynamics systems, for example DSC OFF. 

• During the calibration process for the KAFAS stereo camera immediately after vehicle delivery 
or a camera change. 


A_ 

The Evasion Aid does not release the driver from his comprehensive responsibility as the driver. There 
can be functional limitations because of system restrictions.
