1. Introduction 

1.1. Further information 

This product information describes the new features and adaptations in the infotainment area in 
conjunction with the new Head Unit High 3. The focus is particularly on system-specific features. 

Vehicle-specific descriptions in the infotainment area can be found in the product information

2. Head Unit High 3 

2.1. Introduction 

With the G05 and the G15 a new generation of head units is used at BMW, the Head Unit High 3 
(HU-H3). 

In previous vehicles, the optional equipment Navigation system (SA 609) indicated the vehicle was 
equipped with a navigation system. The designation of the optional equipment and its package 
content has changed to the following: 

♦ BMW Live Cockpit Professional (SA 6U3) 

The BMW Live Cockpit Professional corresponds to the previous optional equipment Navigation 
System - BMW Professional Multimedia. This is currently the only equipment for which the Head Unit 
High 3 (HU-H3) is offered. 

The user interface in the Central Information Display (CID) is also adapted to the new head unit. The 
display and operating concept is called ID7 (7th generation iDrive). More information about ID7 is 
available in the product information ST1855 Displays and Controls 2018.

CD player 

The customer has the option of ordering an external CD player in the vehicle via a retrofitting. The CD 
player is available as an optional accessory. However, CD Player Prep (SA 65A) is required to install 
an external CD player. With this optional equipment the vehicle wiring harness is prepared for the 
retrofitting of the external CD player using an additional wiring harness. 

The CD player is connected to the head unit for the data transfer via a USB line. Another connector is 
integrated at the USB connector, which is responsible for the power supply. The power supply does 
not come from the head unit, but from the power distribution box on the passenger's side.

3.1.4. Settings for toll roads 

For the route settings it has long been possible to avoid certain routes, e.g. ferries or toll roads. The 
route criteria "Avoid toll roads" could previously only be set for the complete route. The route was then 
calculated without the use of toll roads. With the navigation of the HU-H3 a setting can be made that 
toll roads are only avoided in certain countries. For instance, on a holiday journey certain countries in 
which the roads have a toll are activated. In these countries the toll roads are taken into consideration 
when calculating the route.

LIVE map data 


A subscription to the map data is included with the equipment Live Cockpit (SA 6U3). 
This subscription is valid for 4 years. After the subscription has expired it can be extended 
for a fee via the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. 

The map data can be updated in the following ways: 

♦ USB stick (available at BMW Service Center) 

♦ USB stick (download data from the ConnectedDrive portal) 

♦ Automatic updating. 


18 














Infotainment 2018

A_ 

Updating the map data via programming is not possible with the Head Unit High 3 (HU-H3). The entire 
map can only be updated via a USB stick. 


3.2.2. Map data version 

In the following systems/programs you can find information about the current map data installed: 

♦ AIR 

♦ Service Cockpit 

♦ Vehicle menu. 

3.2.3. USB stick 

If the map data is to be updated via a USB stick, then the USB stick must have sufficient memory 
capacity and be properly formatted. 

For the update of the following head units a USB stick with 64 GB memory capacity and a map data 
with NTFS, FAT32 or exFAt formatting is recommended: 

♦ Head Unit High 

♦ Head Unit High 2 

♦ Head Unit High 3.

3.3. Real Time Traffic Information 

The Real Time Traffic Information service is an element of the optional equipment ConnectedPackage 
Professional (SA 6C3/6C4). After expiration of the service, Real Time Traffic Information can be 
extended for a fee in the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. 

In the future, BMW will obtain real-time traffic data from TomTom®. TomTom® offers a higher 
data volume and more data precision than the previous provider. All vehicles with Real Time Traffic 
Information (from F20) are gradually being switched to the new provider. 



Real Time Traffic Information 



The Traffic Message Channel (TMC) is discontinued in vehicles with Head Unit High 3 (HU-H3). 
Traffic information is only displayed in conjunction with the optional equipment Real Time Traffic 
Information (RTTI). If Real Time Traffic Information is not available in the vehicle (e.g. service expired), 
the driver receives a corresponding message about the non-availability when he calls up the traffic 
services.

4. Telephone/Telematics 

4.1. Introduction 

There are some new features/changes for the telephone system in conjunction with the Head Unit 
High 3. For example, third-party apps are no longer supported. Apps from BMW Development (BMW 
Connected) are still supported. 

The connection setup with the Wi-Fi hotspot is simplified with a QR code. 

In the wireless charging station, an NFC aerial along with electronics is integrated for the use of the 
BMW Digital Key. 


4.2. Wireless charging station 

A telephony with wireless charging (SA 6NW) is offered as optional equipment. In conjunction with 
the optional equipment Comfort Access (SA 322), the electronics and an aerial for the Near Field 
Communication (NFC) are integrated in the wireless charging station. This is required for using the 
BMW Digital Key. 

The function of the wireless charging remains unchanged compared to the previous wireless charging 
stations.

optional equipment Comfort Access (SA 322), only one NFC tray is installed. The smartphone cannot 
be charged via this tray, but can be paired for using the BMW Digital Key. This tray can be recognized 
from the missing indicator light and the missing battery symbol on the tray.

Pairing of mobile phone 

The actual pairing of the mobile phone functions the same way as in older vehicles with, e.g. a Head 
Unit High 2. The Bluetooth passkey is displayed in the Central Information Display and on the mobile 
phone and must be compared and confirmed. 

The mobile phone function must be selected before the mobile phone is paired. The following 
functions are available:

For the pairing it does not matter whether the Bluetooth passkey is confirmed first on the mobile 
phone or in the head unit. In the event of problems with the Bluetooth pairing, the connections in the 
vehicle and on the mobile phone should be deleted. Then the pairing process should be repeated. 

At a later stage the selection of Apple CarPlay® will be combined with the selection Bluetooth 
telephony.

The ID transmitter must be in the vehicle for the telephony function in the vehicle. If a mobile phone is 
paired with the vehicle via Bluetooth and the ID transmitter is outside the vehicle, then the telephony is 
not displayed in the Central Information Display (CID) upon selection of the function. 


4.3.2. Settings 

With paired mobile phones different settings can be activated in the telephone menu. For example, 
whether the ringing tone of the mobile phone for an incoming call should be played via the 
loudspeakers. Another setting concerns an automatic connection of the mobile phone when the 
customer gets into the vehicle. The paired mobile phone can also be assigned a driver profile. If the 
mobile phone is assigned a driver profile, only this mobile phone can use the telephony function.

4.5. Connected Drive 

What started 20 years ago with ConnectedDrive in the E38, E46 and E53 with BMW Assist and online 
services has been further developed since that time. 

ConnectedDrive receives a new offer structure concept. Some services can no longer be ordered from 
the factory with ID7, but only via the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. 

Other services are offered in packages, which are compatible with the equipment when ordering 
the vehicle. For example, with the purchase of a navigation system the equipment Real Time Traffic 
Information is also offered.

4.5.1. Offer structure 

The concept of the offer structure is being revised in July 2018. The G05 and the G15 are the first two 
vehicles for which the new offer structure can be found in the price list. 

BMW ConnectedDrive services can no longer be individually selected when ordering the vehicle. 
Different ConnectedDrive packages are offered to the customer which extend the range of functions 
with additional functions and services. For instance, with a navigation system an appropriate package 
with, e.g. Real Time Traffic Information or also On-Street Parking Information, is offered to the 
customer. With a G05 or G15, the package Live Cockpit Professional is already included in the 
standard equipment. 

Some services offered in packages can also be ordered individually or through the BMW 
ConnectedDrive Store.

The functions of Connected Navigation are constantly being expanded. 

Favorite destinations 

Favorite destinations are displayed in the navigation system and can be selected there. The 
synchronization of the navigation system, the BMW Connected app and the BMW ConnectedDrive 
portal is new here. 

Parking Finder 

Information about the Parking Finder can be found in the chapter Parking Finder. 

Suggested destinations 

The navigation system learns destinations that are approached often and at certain times. This 
destination is then suggested after starting the navigation system and the driver can accept this 
suggested destination. Not only destinations such as work or home address are learned, but also 
frequently visited destinations, such as fitness studio or a football club. 

Share destinations 

Destinations can be determined on the smartphone in different apps, e.g. Google Maps™, Apple® 
Maps or also What's App®. These destinations can be shared with the BMW Connected app. 

The fact that the destinations are synchronized directly with the vehicle via the BMW Connected app 
is new. This means the shared destinations are transferred directly via the Open mobility cloud to the 
vehicle. 

Another new feature is the copying of destinations from other apps. The copied destinations are then 
added in the BMW Connected app. 

4.5.4. Connected Teaser 

Connected Teaser enables access to a selection of available services, such as On-Street Parking 
Information for 3 months. After the expiration of the test period the services can be extended for a fee 
through the BMW ConnectedDrive Store.

5. BMW Digital Key 

5.1. Overview 

With the new Service Pack 2018 for the first time BMW offers the option of unlocking a vehicle, 
starting the combustion engine and then locking the vehicle again via a Samsung smartphone. 

This chapter explains how the release for the BMW Digital Key works in service and how other 
Samsung smartphones can be added. 



BMW Digital Key in wireless charging station 


The BMW Digital Key makes possible the unlocking and locking, as well as the vehicle start, with 
a compatible Android® smartphone. The version Oreo 8.0 or higher must be installed on the 
smartphone. 

Currently only Samsung smartphones are possible for the function (Samsung Galaxy S7 and later). 
The reason why Samsung smartphones only currently work lies in the data transmission security. In 
Samsung smartphones (from S7) a NFC secure element is installed. 

Some wireless carriers, such as Verizon, restrict the use of NFC for starting the vehicle. Thus, the 
BMW Digital Key is not available for phones which have service through Verizon. 


38 



Infotainment 2018 

5. BMW Digital Key 



In order to be able to use the BMW Digital Key, the BMW Digital Key must be installed on the 
Android® smartphone via the BMW Connected app. The installation, management and forwarding of 
other BMW Digital Keys is managed via the BMW Connected app. 

The BMW Digital Key is a component of the optional equipment Comfort Access (SA 322). 

The licence for the owner's key with a duration of 1 year is included here. 


5.2. ConnectedDrive Store 

The Digital for5 package is expected for release in the US market in August 2019. 

The Digital for5 package is offered in the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. Four other BMW Digital 
Keys can be purchased with this package. The duration of the owner's key is also extended at the 
same time. Five BMW Digital Keys are therefore possible (1 owner's key and 4 others). The duration 
of the package is limited to 1 year and can then be extended via the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. 

The duration of the owner's key is not credited with the booking of the package Digital for5, but the 
duration of the owner's key runs parallel to the duration of the friend's key from this point. After the end 
of the duration the vehicle can still be unlocked and locked for a short transition period (emergency 
function). A CC message is displayed in the vehicle at the end of the duration. 


5.3. Initial registration 

5.3.1. Service Cockpit 

The first registration for the BMW Digital Key is performed with the BMW Service Center. There is a 
once-off confirmation by the dealer that the owner of the vehicle is authorized to use the owner's key 
and invite co-users (friend's keys) after booking the package Digital for5 via the BMW Connected app. 

The BMW Service Center activates the BMW Digital Key via the Service Cockpit. The BMW Service 
Center generates a BMW Digital Key code together with the customer in the Service Cockpit. This is 
required when forwarding the BMW Digital Key.

Registration of BMW Digital Key in Service Cockpit 

The customer requires the following details at the BMW Service Center for the enabling: 


• Personal ID 

♦ Vehicle registration document. 

The documents required may differ from country to country. 

The procedure is always similar to reordering an ID transmitter. The BMW Service Center activates the 
corresponding services in the ConnectedDrive Service Cockpit. 

With the BMW Connected app the authorized customer smartphone becomes the owner's Digital Key 
and is required for possible passing-on for additional friends' Digital Keys. Only this smartphone is able 
to share the BMW Digital Key with additional "Friends" and their smartphones.

5.3.2. Smartphone tray in the vehicle 

There are different smartphone trays in the vehicle depending on the equipment. A smartphone tray 
is installed in conjunction with the optional equipment telephony with wireless charging (SA 6NW), via 
which the smartphone can be charged wirelessly. If only the optional equipment Comfort Access (SA 
322) is ordered without the telephony with wireless charging, then NFC electronics and a NFC aerial 
are integrated in the smartphone tray, however, the smartphone cannot be charged wirelessly. 

The BMW Digital Key must be installed on the smartphone in the BMW Connected app. After the 
enabling by the BMW Service Center the vehicle can be unlocked using the smartphone. For this, the 
smartphone is held at the outside door handle on the driver's side. 

More information about the NFC electronics in the outside door handle can be found in the reference 
manual ST1856 General Vehicle Electronics 2018. 

The smartphone is then placed in the smartphone tray in the vehicle. This is the only way the NFC 
chip recognizes the smartphone and the engine can be started. For the initial start of the engine, the ID 
transmitter and the smartphone must be in the vehicle at the same time. 

The BMW Digital Key is now available.

Confirm removal of BMW Digital Key 


A 

The owner's BMW Digital Key cannot remove the friend's BMW Digital Key in the BMW Connected 
app. 


5.4.2. Reset 

With a reset the function of the BMW Digital Key is completely reset. The dealer confirmation is also 
revoked. This should be carried out when a vehicle is sold in order to avoid unauthorized access to the 
vehicle. 

If a BMW Digital Key is registered after a reset, then the process is the same as that for a new vehicle. 


5.5. Transfer BMW Digital Key 

Four additional smartphones can be activated for the BMW Digital Key, so-called friend's keys. The 
corresponding package "Digital for5" must be ordered in the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. The 
duration of the friend's key is 1 year and can be extended if required. A separate ConnectedDrive 
account is required for each additional smartphone. The friend's key must meet the same 
prerequisites as the owner's key for the smartphone (Samsung smartphone, etc.).

6. Audio Systems 


6.1. Introduction 

In vehicles with a Head Unit High 3 (HU-H3) there are some changes and new features in relation to 
the audio systems. 

The audio systems receive some new features with the Service Pack 2018. For example, tuners are 
no longer integrated in the Head Unit High 3 (HU-H3). They are located in a separate, new control unit, 
the Receiver Audio Module (RAM). 

The previous audio amplifiers are replaced with a new control unit, the Booster (in different versions). 

In this product information the combination options of RAM and Booster are explained. A description 
of the specific speaker systems and the installation locations of the control units can be found in the 
vehicle-specific product information G05/G15 Infotainment. 


6.2. Receiver Audio Module 

The Receiver Audio Module (RAM) is a new control unit in the vehicles. It is used in conjunction with 
the Head Unit High 3 (HU-H3). 

Here it is an audio amplifier with integrated tuners and sound processor and a range of other additional 
interface functions. This also includes the sound generation of the turn indicator in the instrument 
cluster. The sound is not generated in the instrument cluster, but in the Receiver Audio Module (RAM). 

The RAM contains the following functions in the maximum equipment: 

• AM/FM tuner 

• Aerial diversity for AM/FM 

♦ Audio amplifier 

♦ Active Sound Design. 

The RAM makes available the data to the head unit via an Ethernet connection. 

The loudspeakers are connected directly at the Receiver Audio Module (RAM) for a stereo or hi-fi 
system (NF lines). The sound signals for the optional equipment Harman Kardon surround sound 
system are partly transmitted via the Receiver Audio Module and partly via the Booster. The bass 
speakers are connected at the Booster, the mid-range speakers as well as the tweeters are connected 
at the RAM. 

The Booster is connected directly to the RAM via an Ethernet connection.

7. Driver Profiles 

7.1. History 

Driver profiles are created in order to save personal vehicle settings. If several drivers use one vehicle, 
each driver can create his own personal driver profile. If this driver profile is selected, the vehicle 
assumes the saved settings. 

The customer profiles are possible in BMW vehicles since the E46. There they were called Car/Key 
Memory. 

Since the F01/F02 the term driver profiles has been used. Certain vehicle settings (seat setting, radio 
station, etc.) are saved in the control units. A driver profile is assigned to each ID transmitter in advance 
at the factory. 


7.2. Overview 

Cloud-based driver profiles are introduced with the new head unit, the Head Unit High 3. In order 
to create a driver profile, the customer must log in with his personal ConnectedDrive account in the 
vehicle. 

A maximum of 3 driver profiles can be saved per vehicle. If no driver profile is created, all settings 
made are automatically saved in the guest profile. 

The driver profile should be created as early as possible because settings previously made in the 
guest profile cannot be transferred to a driver profile. 

A driver profile can be activated either manually by selection in the Central Information Display or 
automatically upon unlocking the vehicle. In order to activate the automatic driver recognition, a driver 
profile must be linked to a certain key or the BMW Digital Key. It is also possible to allocate a PIN to 
protect against unauthorized access. 

The active driver profile is displayed in the welcome screen and at any time by means of the profile 
picture in the status bar. 

Driver profiles are stored in the cloud (BMW back end) by the linking with the ConnectedDrive account. 
These settings are automatically synchronized between all ID7 vehicles. Due to the automatic cloud 
synchronization, the manual export/import function (USB) is no longer required. If cloud storage is not 
desired, the synchronization can be deactivated in the vehicle. 

A 


An active ConnectedDrive account (username and password) is a prerequisite in order to create 
a driver profile in the vehicle. This is the same ConnectedDrive account that the customer uses 
to register in the BMW Connected app or in the BMW web portal. Every user requires their own 
ConnectedDrive account that can be set up for free via the BMW ConnectedDrive web page. 
Customers who already have a BMW vehicle including ConnectedDrive account should use this 
account in the new vehicle for the driver profiles.

Confirmation of driver profile 



The driver profile should be created as early as possible. If a driver profile is created at a later stage, the 
settings change to the delivery status. This is because of the change of the profile from guest to the 
driver profile. 

In the event of a poor mobile phone connection, it may take longer until the driver profile is fully loaded 
to the vehicle. In this case the e-mail address appears in the Central Information Display (CID) instead 
of the name and an additional notification that the synchronization in the background is completed.

7.4.1. Driver recognition 

Up to three identification options can be defined for a driver profile. So that the driver profile is 
automatically activated when the vehicle is unlocked, a link with the ID transmitter or the BMW Digital 
Key is required. 

The option BMW Digital Key is only available if the BMW Digital Key was already activated in the 
vehicle and the corresponding smartphone is in the smartphone tray.

Driver profiles for which a link is active can be identified by the lock symbol. 

If driver recognition is linked by more than one method, priority is given to the ID transmitter. 


7.4.2. Passing on the key 

If an ID transmitter is passed on by the customer to a third person (e.g. BMW Service Center), it is 
recommended to pass on an ID transmitter that is not linked to a driver profile. Via this ID transmitter 
the GUEST profile is automatically activated when the vehicle is unlocked. 


61 













Infotainment 2018 

7. Driver Profiles 


If both ID transmitters are already linked to a driver profile, the driver can still protect his profile against 
changes. The driver temporarily cancels the link to the ID transmitter. If a PIN is also assigned, the 
profile also cannot be activated by manual selection and thus also not changed. If the link is cancelled 
and the vehicle is put to sleep after unlocking, the GUEST profile is activated when the vehicle is 
unlocked again. When the driver receives his vehicle back again, he reactivates the key link. Then his 
profile is automatically reactivated. 

7.4.3. Set up PIN protection 

The individual driver profiles can be protected against unauthorized access with a PIN. This may be 
the case, for example, if there is only one ID transmitter for a vehicle, but the vehicle is used by several 
people e.g. company car. 

PIN protection is useful in addition to the key link if the ID transmitter is mixed up and the link to the key 
is removed.

7.4.5. Settings for the driver profile 

Via Settings, it can be defined whether the driver should be addressed with first name and surname 
or only with first name. The name itself can only be changed via the ConnectedDrive portal. The 
synchronization can also be activated or deactivated here. If the synchronization is deactivated, no 
settings are stored in the Open mobility cloud. Then it is not possible to transfer settings to other 
vehicles, e.g. a loaner car. 

The synchronization only works between vehicles with a Head Unit High 3. 

The driver profiles can be deleted in the Settings menu.

The lock screen of Valet mode is displayed on the Central Information Display (CID). 
The deactivation of Valet mode is dependent on which driver profile is selected: 

• PIN known 

♦ Guest profile. 



PIN known 

If the PIN is known, Valet mode can be deactivated by inputting the PIN irrespective of the driver 
profile. 

PIN unknown 

If the PIN is not known or has been forgotten, Valet mode can be deactivated by inputting the 
ConnectedDrive login data. 

Guest profile 

In the guest profile, Valet mode can only be deactivated if it was activated beforehand by the guest 
profile. If the PIN in the guest profile is not known or has been forgotten, Valet mode can be deblocked 
by inputting the PIN of another driver profile.

New for 2018 is the integration of Amazon Alexa directly in the vehicle. Amazon Alexa can be 
operated via voice input in the vehicle. 

Amazon Alexa Car Integration is possible for vehicles with a Head Unit Basic 2 or Head Unit High 2 
from production date March 2018. 


8.4. Prerequisites 

Prerequisites for the integration of Amazon Alexa are: 

• Current version of BMW Connected app (Version 9) 

• Valid Amazon account 

• Active ConnectedDrive service Amazon Alexa Car Integration (available in the BMW 
ConnectedDrive Store) 

• Enabled vehicles with Head Unit Basic 2 (HU-B2) or Head Unit High 2 (HU-H2) (ID5/ID6). 

The smartphone must be connected to the head unit via Bluetooth. The reason for this is that certain 
applications for Amazon Alexa in the vehicle are carried out via the internal SIM card (P-SIM) and other 
applications are carried out via the smartphone's SIM card (C-SIM). 

At the moment Alexa Car Integration only works with an Apple® iPhone®.

Many functions and services, which are possible at home via Amazon Alexa, can now be activated or 
instructed directly from the vehicle. 


Amazon Alexa is activated via the voice input button on the steering wheel. The voice input button 
is pressed briefly. Then the identifying word "Alexa" is mentioned. If the identifying word is not 
mentioned, the conventional voice input (natural voice control on-board or off-board) of the vehicle is 
active.
