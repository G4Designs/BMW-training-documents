G15 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 


The most versatile range of Driver Assistance Systems ever for a BMW model was launched with 
the introduction of the G12. Numerous innovative systems have been introduced and have opened 
the way for highly automated driving. One year later, the G30 expanded the already varied range of 
offerings with new Driver Assistance Systems. 

The new BMW 8 series with development designation G15 continues with these innovations. The 
Back-up Assistant has been available since the introduction of this new vehicle on the market, which 
makes comfortable and automatically guided reversing possible. Furthermore, many of the Driver 
Assistance Systems introduced in the G30 feature new functions and therefore also make it easier for 
the driver to continue guiding the vehicle by: 

• providing the driver with information 

• prompting the driver with suggestions 

• automatically intervening in the driving process.

• ACC Stop&Go with Steering Assistant 
(including Traffic Jam Assistant) 


To be able to facilitate easy operation of the ever-increasing Driver Assistance Systems without 
additional buttons, the operation of the Driver Assistance Systems has been changed with the optional 
equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU). The Assist button is pressed to activate 
the Driver Assistance System. Then, by pressing the MODE button, the vehicle will cycle between two 
Driver Assistance Systems: either ACC Stop&Go or ACC Stop&Go with Steering Assistant (including 
Traffic Jam Assistant.) The chosen system is now active. Pressing the Assist button while the system 
is active will deactivate the system. 

Note: Changing the Driver Assistance System mode is only possible when the system is active. 

Example: The driver is using ACC Stop&Go and would like to engage the Steering Assistant. Pressing 
the MODE button would then select the Steering Assistant with ACC Stop&Go to be able to use 
both functions. If the Assist button is pressed now, Steering Assistant is deactivated together with 
ACC Stop&Go. 

The Driver Assistance Systems that can be selected with the mode button are displayed to the driver 
as a selection list in the instrument cluster. 

With the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU) there is an LED above 
both the left and the right control pads on the MFL. The two LEDs provide additional visual indicators 
to the instructions issued in the instrument cluster and the Central Information Display. 

• Green: The assistance system is active and assumes lateral guidance 
(does not apply to the US market) 

• Yellow: Interruption of the assistance system pending 

• Red: The assistance system is deactivated

2.3. Intelligent Safety button 

The Intelligent Safety button, already familiar from other BMW models, enables the Driver Assistance 
Systems to be operated from a central location. The Intelligent Safety button can be used both to 
switch the systems on and off directly and to call up the Intelligent Safety menu to personalize the 
settings. 

In the G15, depending on the vehicle equipment, the following Driver Assistance Systems can be 
personalized via the Intelligent Safety menu: 

• Front collision warning 

• Side collision warning 

• Lane Departure Warning 

• Steering intervention 

• Blind Spot Collision Warning 


2.4. Parking assistance button 

The parking assistance button no longer has to be pressed and held while maneuvering into a parking 
space when using Automatic Parking. A single press of the button is sufficient.

3. Daytime Pedestrian Protection 

The Daytime Pedestrian Protection function in the G15 is a component part of Active Driving Assistant 
(SA 5AS) and is effected with the aid of the KAFAS Mid camera. 

For the first time, as part of the Daytime Pedestrian Protection function, the driver also receives a 
warning of cyclists. Just as with the pedestrian warning, only an acute warning is issued in a speed 
range of approximately 5-65 km/h with the cyclist warning. If the acute warning is issued, an automatic 
brake intervention through to maximum deceleration is initiated. 

When an acute warning is issued, the same symbol is used for both the pedestrian warning and for the 
cyclist warning in the instrument cluster (KOMBI) and, if applicable, in the Head-Up Display (HUD). 


Symbols (HUD & KOMBI) 


Explanation 



Acute warning: 

• Person symbol flashes and a signal 
sounds 

• Request for intervention by braking 
and, if necessary, evasive action (if 
necessary assisted by the Evasion 
Assistant). 


There are no configuration possibilities in the Intelligent Safety menu for the pedestrian and cyclist 
warning. The only possibility is deactivation by pressing the Intelligent Safety button for a long period. 
The pedestrian and cyclist warning is automatically switched back on after each terminal change. 

As a result of the new Evasion Assistant functions, the Evasion Assistant is also available to the driver 
in the event of a pedestrian and cyclist warning. 


24 






G15 Driver Assistance Systems 

4. Intersection Collision Warning 

The Intersection collision warning is also used in the G15. Since an extremely exact environment 
analysis must be performed in front of the vehicle for this function, the data from the KAFAS High 
camera, the front radar sensor long range (FRSF) and the side radar sensors short range front 
(SRSNVL and SRSNVR) are evaluated. Thus, the Intersection collision warning with city braking 
function is only available with the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU). 

In the previous function characteristics, an acute warning is issued and a preconditioning of the brake 
system is performed. The responsibility for preventing an imminent collision is still the driver's alone. 

With the introduction of the G15, the Intersection collision warning with city braking function now 
provides assistance in the speed range of approximately 10-80 km/h as and, when required, with a 
supporting brake intervention. The intensity of the brake intervention is controlled depending on the 
situation. 

In addition, the acute warning has been supplemented by an advance warning. The warning time of the 
Intersection collision warning with city braking function can only be set as part of the Front collision 
warning in the iDrive menu. 



G15 adjusting the warning time 

A 

The Intersection collision warning with city braking function does not relieve the driver of personal 
responsibility for correctly judging the visibility and traffic situation. The driver's driving style should be 
adapted to the traffic conditions. The driver should check the traffic conditions, and react accordingly if 
required.

6. Automatic Lane Change 

The G15 introduces the Automatic Lane Change function to the US market. Automatic Lane Change 
supports the driver when changing lanes, for example when passing on highways. The system offers 
the driver further convenience with this and can contribute to avoiding possible collisions with another 
vehicle travelling in the same direction. 

If the driver has activated the system and the destination lane is free, the vehicle automatically carries 
out a steering wheel movement and returns to lane guidance (Steering Assistant) after the lane change 
is completed. 

The system assists the driver in the speed range from approximately 70 km/h to approximately 
180 km/h. 


6.1. Functional principle 

Automatic Lane Change is activated if the driver operates the turn indicator (“one-touch signalling” 
and holds it for approximately 1 second) with Steering Assistant activated. This signals to the 
system that the driver would like to change to the adjacent lane with system support. 

First the system analyzes whether a danger-free lane change is possible, and also whether sufficient 
room for the maneuver is available. The surroundings are monitored by the side radar sensors and the 
data from the KAFAS camera. The KAFAS camera is principally used for lane detection. 

The radar sensors are not only responsible for the detection of an object, but are also able to take into 
consideration the speed of vehicles detected nearby. 

6.1.1. Monitoring ranges 

The monitoring ranges for the radar sensors are as follows:

6. Automatic Lane Change 

The vehicle performs the lane change automatically if the sensor system does not detect any 
vehicles in the relevant safety zone and if there is sufficient room for maneuvering available. It is of no 
importance whether the vehicle lane change is for passing purposes or whether the driver is simply 
wishing to change lanes. 

The direction of the lane change is determined by the turn indicator which has been previously set. 



G15 Automatic Lane Change 


The driver merely has to monitor the lane change. This does not, however, mean that he is released 
from his duties as a driver. For instance, the driver is also obliged to check whether a lane change is 
permissible at all, and has to take account of passing restrictions, solid lines, etc. Automatic Lane 
Change does not take these circumstances into consideration. 

Once the change to the adjacent lane is complete, the vehicle returns to lane guidance (Steering 
Assistant). 

The lane change maneuver will be aborted if, once it has started, the turn indicator lever is released too 
soon (less than approximately 1 second), a Blind Spot Collision Warning warning is issued or an object 
is detected to the side of the vehicle. If the lane change maneuver is automatically cancelled before the 
vehicle has crossed the lane marker, the vehicle is guided back into the original lane. 

A_ 

The driver has full responsibility for the lane change maneuver, including checking that the destination 
lane is free. 


The maximum steering torque has been set in such a way that it can always be overruled by the driver 
and therefore steering past the maximum steering torque is possible. This means that the driver has 
the capability at all times to abort the automatic lane change.

A_ 

Automatic Lane Change cannot replace the driver’s personal judgement of the traffic situation. 
Therefore, check the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking around, otherwise there may be 
a risk of an accident as a result of road users or objects which lie outside the detection range of the 
sensors. Approaching vehicles can be detected too late or not at all because of the limits inherent in 
the system. Automatic Lane Change does not release the driver from his own responsibilities.

6. Automatic Lane Change 

6.3. Functional prerequisites 

The following basic prerequisites must be met to use Automatic Lane Change: 

• Steering Assistant is active. 

• The vehicle is traveling on a divided highway. 

• The turn indicator lever is held in the “one-touch signalling position” for approximately 
1 second. 

• The driving lane line to be crossed has been detected. 

• “Hands-on” (hands on the steering wheel) must be detected at the start of the maneuver. 

• Blind Spot Collision Warning is active and not issuing a warning. 

• No vehicles have been detected in the maneuvering space to the side of the vehicle. 

• No stationary objects (such as roadside structures, posts, etc.) have been detected in the 
maneuvering space to the side of the vehicle. 

• The vehicle is travelling at a speed between approximately 70 km/h and approximately 
180 km/h. 


6.4. Deactivation criteria 

Automatic Lane Change is automatically deactivated in the following situations: 

• Automatic Lane Change is no longer executed if the trigger conditions are not met within 
approximately 10 seconds from the start of the turn indication. 

• Automatic Lane Change will be aborted if, once a lane change maneuver has started, the turn 
indicator lever is released too soon (less than approximately 1 second), a Blind Spot Collision 
Warning is issued or an object is detected to the side of the vehicle. 

• Automatic Lane Change is also aborted if the driver steers opposite to the steering torque 
applied by the system. 

• If the lane marker on the other side of the destination lane is not detected in sufficient time 
after passing over the lane marking to be crossed.

7. Cruise Control 

7.1. Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function 

Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function is included in the G15 with the optional equipment 
Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU). As previously, the set speed is limited to a maximum of 

180 km/h. 


7.2. Speed Limiter 

The G15 introduces the Speed Limiter to the US market. This function has been available in European 
markets for many years. 

With the Speed Limiter, the maximum speed of the vehicle can be limited by the driver. The minimum 
value that can be selected is 30 km/h. 

If required, the driver can consciously exceed the speed limit by firmly accelerating (pressing the 
accelerator pedal down fully). The limit is automatically reactivated when the driver speed drops below 
the set limit. 

The Speed Limiter does not initiate any active brake interventions. This means that if the driver 
inadvertently exceeds the set speed limit, as can be the case during downhill driving for example, the 
system does not brake automatically. 

7.2.1. Operation 

The Speed Limiter can be activated and deactivated using the LIM button on the multifunction 
steering wheel (MFL). The vehicle’s current speed is adopted as the speed limit. If the system is 
activated while the vehicle is stationary, 30 km/h is automatically set as the speed limit. The driver 
can increase or decrease the chosen speed limit by using the rocker switch on the left side of the 
multifunction steering wheel (MFL). 

A mark is set at the corresponding speed in the KOMBI. 

A_ 

The system should only be used when it is possible to drive at a constant speed. The driver is solely 
responsible for the vehicle and the speed at which it is driven.

7.3. Speed Limit Assistant 

The G15 introduces the Speed Limit Assistant to the US market. The Speed Limit Assistant function 
supports the driver by adopting the speed limits. 

Speed Limit Assistant is available for the following systems: 

• Active Driving Assistant Professional (SA 5AU). 

Manual adoption of the speed limit is executed via the SET button.

Manual adoption of the upcoming speed limit must be activated in the Drive menu and can also be 
configured and deactivated in the same place. Manual adoption is executed by pressing the "SET 
button" on the multifunction steering wheel (MFL). Automatic adoption of the upcoming speed limit 
is not available for the US market.

8. Automatic Parking 

Automatic Parking was previously known as Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA). 
The control module is still referred to as PMA in technical systems. 


8.1. Maneuvering out of a parking space 

With the launch of the Service Pack 2018, Automatic Parking supports maneuvering out of parallel 
parking spaces. Here the system assumes acceleration, braking and steering until the vehicle comes 
to a stop in such a way that it can be driven by the driver out of the parking space without further 
steering wheel movement. The necessary drive position changes and switching on the turn indicator 
are likewise performed by the PMA. The LED lights of the multifunction steering wheel light up green 
here. 

This function is planned for release at a later date. 



The driver remains responsible for maneuvering out of the parking space and merging into traffic. 


A number of functional requirements must be met to enable Automatic Parking to maneuver out of the 
parking space automatically: 

• The vehicle must have been maneuvered into the parking space with Automatic Parking 
beforehand 

• An obstacle must be detected in front of the vehicle 

• The parking space must be at least 0.8 m longer than the vehicle.

9. Back-up Assistant 


9.1. Functional principle 

The Back-up Assistant supports the driver when reversing out of entrances and narrow streets or in 
multi-story parking garages. For this purpose, the Back-up Assistant stores the distance travelled and 
the steering wheel movements made before the vehicle is parked. This is performed automatically 
under a speed of approximately 35 km/h for the last 50 meters covered in the forward direction. 



G15 Back-up Assistant (examples of possible applications) 


After the Back-up Assistant is activated, the vehicle assumes lateral guidance for the stored distance 
covered. The LED displays on the multifunction steering wheel light up green in the process. 


A_ 

The driver himself remains responsible for accelerating and braking. A change of environment after 
the distance covered is stored, for example due to a changed parking position of a different vehicle, is 
not taken into consideration. The driver is thus responsible for monitoring the vehicle environment and 
must brake or if necessary steer himself accordingly. 


9.2. Operation 

The function menu can be called up in the Central Information Display (CID) after starting the engine 
by pressing the parking assistance button or by selecting the reverse gear. The function can then be 
activated directly via the Controller or in the Central Information Display (CID).
