Vehicles with gasoline engines and "conventional brake systems" require a vacuum pump for brake 
assist. Vehicles with gasoline engines and DSCi brake systems do not require a vacuum booster as the 
pedal force in the DSCi brake system is increased hydraulically. The graphics show the oil pumps of 
the B58 engine and B58TU engine with and without combined vacuum pump.

4. Automatic Transmission 

4.1. Automatic transmission GA8HPTU2 



GA8HPTU2 automatic transmission 


In the G05 is equipped with the GA8HPTU2 automatic transmission. Two variants are used, depending 
on the engine type:

4.1.1. Special features 

The following further developments made it possible to increase the comfort, dynamics and efficiency 
of the 8-speed automatic transmission: 

• As the gear shift intervals have increased, it has been possible to increase the range. 

• The shifting dynamics have been improved through redevelopment of the electronic 
transmission control (EGS). 

• Improved driving comfort by using a centrifugal pendulum to counteract the rotational 
irregularity of the engine. 

• Enhanced customer experience due to new operating possibilities with the driving experience 
switch or shift paddles. 


6 







G05 Powertrain/Chassis 

4. Automatic Transmission 


Emergency release 

As is already known to be the case with the automatic transmission 8HPTU, the automatic 
transmission 8HPTU2 can be also be unlocked in different ways in the event of a breakdown to ensure 
the vehicle can be rolled: 

• Mechanical emergency release. 

• Electronic emergency release. 


A 

Towing the vehicle with one axle lifted is not permitted! Although the automatic transmission 
would in fact survive towing for a time depending on the speed without being damaged, it cannot 
be guaranteed that the parking lock would be permanently unlocked due to modification of the 
mechanical or electronic transmission emergency release. If the parking lock were suddenly to be 
engaged during a towing operation, the components and vehicle could be damaged and a serious 
accident could occur!

5. Front Axle Differential 

5.1. Use of front axle transmission 

5.1.1. Variants 

Two different front axle transmissions with the following designation are used: 

• VAG168AL 

• VAG 175AL 

Adaptations 

• Adapted axle ratio for the G05. 

• Changeover to a low viscosity oil. 

• Optimization of transmission oil flow for lower transmission oil temperatures 
and reduction of heat entering the front axle transmission. 

• Reduction in weight and splash losses due to welding of ring gear. 

These measures have made it possible once again to increase the efficiency of the front axle 
transmission and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

G05 Powertrain/Chassis 

6. Rear Axle Final Drive 

6.1. Use of rear axle differential 

6.1.1. Variants 

Two different rear axle differentials with the following designation are used: 

• HAG 205AL 

• HAG 215LW 

Adaptations 

• Adapted axle ratio for the G05. 

• Use of thin oil. 

• Technical measures for optimizing the weight. 

As a result of these measures, it was possible to increase the efficiency of the rear axle differential and 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 


6.2. Rear axle differential with lock 

The all-wheel drive version of the G05 can be equipped with a rear axle differential with locking 
function HAG 215LWS. The regulated rear axle differential lock can be identified by an e-motor which 
is screwed on from the outside. Furthermore, a housing cover made of aluminium is installed which 
closes the existing grey cast iron housing to the rear.

The regulated rear axle differential lock is an electromechanical rear axle differential lock which is 
based on the current M differential of M GmbH. The regulated rear axle differential lock allows the 
slip between the right and left rear wheel to be reduced by establishing a friction-locked connection 
between both wheels via a multidisc clutch. If required, the multidisc clutch package is closed via an 
e-motor and is applied between the rear wheel and differential housing. A lock-up torque of up to 
1500 Nm can be generated irrespective of the requested drive torque.

The drive torque to be transmitted at the wheels of the rear axle is calculated in the Dynamic Stability 
Control (DSC) and forwarded to the regulated rear axle differential lock (GHAS) control unit via a 
FlexRay bus. The regulated rear axle differential lock control unit calculates the adjusting torque to be 
set at the toothed mobile adjusting disc of the ball ramp based on the requested drive torque. 

The adjusting torque required for control is generated by the electric motor. The rotational movement 
of the electric motor is converted to an axial movement by a ball ramp mechanism and the clutch 
package of the multidisc clutch is closed or opened. 

The contact pressure of the multidisc clutch is increased or reduced depending on the requested 
torque distribution. As a result, the stepped-up engine torque is steplessly distributed between the 
two rear wheels corresponding to the driving situation. 

For more information on the rear axle differential with lock HAG 215LWS, refer to the product 
information "G02 complete vehicle",Regulated rear axle differential lock. 

Oil change 

The oil filling of the rear axle differential lock is designed for the entire service life of the assembly. 

A 

BMW AG vehicles with regulated rear axle differential lock are not designed for use on racing tracks. If 
not observed, this can lead to premature wear of the rear axle differential lock and its components. In 
the event of a customer complaint "Noises from the rear axle differential", an oil change in the rear axle 
differential must initially be performed before replacing individual components or the entire assembly!

9.4.2. Basic chassis and suspension 

Compared to the predecessor (FI 5), the standard chassis and suspension variant without optional 
equipment already offers regulated dampers in the basic version and therefore a significant 
improvement in driving comfort also with significantly enhanced BMW-typical driving dynamics 
characteristics. 

In contrast to all other chassis and suspension packages, the basic version of the Driving Experience 
Control does not affect regulation of the Electronic Damper Control (EDC). 

9.4.3. Adaptive M suspension (SA 2VF) 

This chassis and suspension package offers modified suspension and damping characteristics 
compared to the basic chassis and suspension via the Driving Experience Control. 

Influence of the Driving Experience Control on the EDC control 

• COMFORT 

• SPORT 

The SPORT driving mode offers a much sportier damping characteristic at the expense of driving 
comfort. 


9.4.4. Adaptive M suspension Professional (SA 2VW) 

From a functional standpoint, this chassis and suspension package has a particularly strong influence 
on the cornering behavior of the vehicle. This is achieved by using the electric active roll stabilization 
front (EARSV) and the electric active roll stabilization rear (EARSH). Both active stabilizers are 
adjusted by the vertical dynamic platform (VDP). The increase in driving dynamics is largely due to 
a significant reduction in the roll angle of the body during cornering and a neutral drivability with low 
understeering tendency. What is notable about this suspension control system is that the increase in 
driving dynamics is not achieved in any manner whatsoever at the expense of the driver's comfort. 

9.4.5. 2-axle Air Suspension (SA 2VR) 

Due to the two-axle ride level control, there are no adverse effects whatsoever on comfort. 

The driving characteristics can be modified in the usual manner via the Driving Experience Control. 

Includes a level change rocker button which allows the customer to set 5 different ride heights in total 
from -40 mm to +40 mm.

9.4.6. xOffroad package(SA ZOR) 

The offroad package contains the 2-axle Air suspension (SA 2VR) and the electronically regulated rear 
axle differential lock (GHAS). 

In addition to the level change rocker button for the air suspension, this chassis and suspension 
package also includes an offroad button. The driver can select 4 different offroad driving modes via 
the offroad button. This allows the driving characteristics to be adapted to the local conditions, e.g. 
snow, sand, gravel or rock. Additionally, a preconfigured ride level is set based on the offroad mode 
selected. The resulting additional ground clearance increases the fording depth and offroad capability 
on challenging sections, e.g. embankments or ramps with steep drive-up angle.

The offroad button is the offroad Driving Experience Control. It supports the driver with the assistance 
of various transmission modes in challenging terrain. The Driving Experience Control for road cannot 
be operated at the same time as the offroad button. In contrast to the level change rocker button for 
the air suspension, the offroad rocker button not only influences the vehicle level, but also the drive, 
chassis and suspension and assistance systems. Once the offroad driving program has been exited 
by pressing the offroad button the last Driving Experience Control mode to be selected for road is 
enabled.

• By actuating the Driving Experience Control. 


9.5.2. Operating strategy 

To support the driver when driving offroad, 4 different transmission modes are available. These 
can be activated by pressing the offroad rocker button. The transmission modes support the driver 
through systematic adjustment of various drive and chassis and suspension systems. The vehicle can 
therefore be perfectly tuned to the offroad conditions.

* The Efficiency Mode was introduced in the G12 with the new transfer box ATC13-1. In Efficiency 
Mode the multidisc clutch in the transfer box is fully opened so that no power flows to the wheels of 
the front axle. The lubrication has been further reduced which ensures that the fuel consumption is 
lower. 

The effects on the control of the xDrive all-wheel system and control of the regulated rear axle 
differential lock (GHAS) shown in the table cannot be perceived by the driver. This is a subtle pilot 
control. Due to the exceptionally high control speed of both systems, a permanently high pilot control 
of the degree of locking when offroad mode is activated is no longer necessary. 

Both systems also continuously regulate the adjusted degree of locking when offroad mode is not 
activated and independently of the local conditions.

When the speed threshold of 30 km/h (18 mph) ("Rock" offroad mode) or 60 km/h (37 mph) ("Sand/

in each case. When the speed falls below the defined threshold again, the initial level is automatically 
restored by raising the vehicle.

The air suspensions used up till now at BMW were open systems. The G05 is the first BMW to be 
equipped with a closed system. In the closed system, continuous pneumatic pressure compensation 
does not occur between the environment and control system does not take place and instead takes 
place within the control system between the pressure accumulator and air suspension struts. This 
means the pneumatic pressure generated by the mechanical compressor can be used for several 
control operations. This increases the efficiency of the system and ensures an outstanding degree of 
utilization.

11.3. Structure and function 

The main purpose of the air suspension is to increase driving comfort. The system performs 
adjustment mainly at standstill, e.g. in order to compensate for a change in height due to the vehicle 
load. The inertia of the system means that it cannot react to driving dynamics disturbance variables, 
which may occur when the vehicle is driven quickly on twisting roads. 

11.3.1. Control when driving 

Adjustment is however possible when driving with low transverse and longitudinal dynamics. 

An adjustment may be triggered when driving for one of the following reasons: 

• Speed-dependent driving level control 

• Driving level control due to reduction in fuel level (change in load status) 

• Driving level control due to changes in the temperature of the air in the air suspension struts 

• Manual adjustment of the driving level due to customer request (e.g. Driving Experience 
Control SPORT mode, level change rocker button or offroad rocker button).

The vertical dynamic platform (VDP) reads in the current ride heights via 4 ride height sensors 
and sends these to the control unit for electronic ride height control (EHC). Deviations between 
the target and actual level are calculated by the EHC control unit and adjusted if necessary via the 
solenoid valves inside the air supply unit. The required air volume is removed from or supplied to the 
pressure accumulator. If the pressure in the pressure accumulator is insufficient, this is equalized by an 
electrical compressor. The compressor is controlled by the EHC control unit. 


35 


















G05 Powertrain/Chassis 

11. Two-axle Ride Level Control 


The air suspension in the G05 is controlled by a 3-channel control system. With this system, the two 
air suspension struts of the front axle are jointly controlled and the air suspension struts of the rear 
axle are controlled separately. The aim of this approach is to be able to compensate for any tilting of 
the vehicle rear axle that occurs due to uneven load conditions. As the load status at the front axle 
on the right and left is the same under all operating conditions, control is effected in this case via a 
common channel. To do so, the EHC control unit generates a mean value from the two actual values 
of the ride height sensors on the front axle and adjusts the driving level until the target level and actual 
level correspond. The advantage of this type of control is that the corresponding driving level can be 
approached without continuous readjustment. 

To avoid dazzling of oncoming traffic, the front axle is lowered first followed by the rear axle. The axles 
are raised in the reverse order (rear axle followed by front axle). 

To prevent water being drawn in, the air intake hose has been installed as high up as possible. This 
has the benefit of providing a good fording depth. An air drier dehumidifies the air drawn in to prevent 
corrosion and icing inside the pneumatic system. 


11.3.2. Air supply unit 

The air supply unit consists of the electronic ride height control (EHC) control unit, electrical 
compressor and a solenoid valve block. 

To prevent vibrations being transferred to the body when the compressor is running, the holder of the 
air supply unit is fastened to the vehicle by rubber elements. 

The air supply unit has 2 separate ports for the air intake and discharge hoses. These are however 
joined upstream of the air filter via a Y-adapter to form one hose. The air is therefore drawn in and 
released via one hose.

Bus overview 

The electronic ride height control (EHC) processes the data for control of the air suspension. This 
receives the relevant data, such as the position of the level change rocker button, via the PT-CAN. 
The EHC control unit controls the actuation of the solenoid valves and the mechanical compressor 
thus ensuring implementation of the predefined ride heights. 

The information on the current ride heights is made available by the vertical dynamic platform (VDP).

11.3.4. Air suspension strut 

The air suspension strut contains the shock absorber with U-type bellows. The U-type bellows or 
the shock absorber cannot be replaced separately. All shock absorbers in the G05 are equipped as 
standard with an Electronic Damper Control (EDC) with expansion stage High. A special feature of 
the EDC High compared to EDC Basic is continuous damper control which is adapted to the road 
conditions. The EDC Basic on the other hand does not offer continuous control and instead a manual 
adjustment of the damper characteristic via the Driving Experience Control. 

The EDC High is available in the following 2 expansion stages: 

• EDC High two-stage (separate rebound and compression stage control G12/G30) 

• EDC High single-stage (shared rebound and compression stage control G01/G05). 

In contrast to the G12, the G05 is equipped with an EDC High with a single-stage control. In this case, 
the rebound and compression stages are controlled via a shared controller.

when the compressed air lines are undone.

The pneumatic connections with integrated residual holding valve on the air suspension strut cannot 
be replaced separately. If an attempt is made to remove these, damage will occur. The entire air 
suspension strut will subsequently have to be replaced.

Filling the pressure accumulator in the G05 

If the quantity of air in the system falls below the minimum, the pressure accumulator is filled with the 
assistance of the electrical compressor. To do this the EHC control unit puts the components of the air 
supply unit listed below into the corresponding states as specified in the table.

When the control valves 1 and 4 are activated, the filling pressure of the pressure accumulator is 
admitted to the pressure sensor. Regulation of the pressure in the electrical compressor is therefore 
possible. When the corresponding system air quantity is reached, valves 1 and 4 are closed and the 
electrical compressor is switched off. 

If a very large quantity of air is fed in, the pressure accumulator may be filled in stages. This is required 
in order to regenerate the dryer at regular intervals.

The intake air is cleaned by the air filter upstream of the compressor and dried by the air drier 
downstream of the compressor. Cleaning is necessary so that the valves are protected against 
soiling. Water is extracted from the air to prevent the valves from icing up at low outside temperatures. 
If the valves were to freeze due to excessively high air humidity in the air supply system, the air 
suspension would no longer be able to perform the self-levelling operation. To avoid this, the air drier is 
permanently cleaned or dewatered. 

The granulate in the air drier absorbs air humidity at high pressure and releases it at low pressure. If 
the compressed air flows through the granulate when filling the system, moisture is removed from it. 

To regenerate the air drier, air is routed via a throttle from the pressure accumulator to the air drier. The 
air flowing through the air drier at low pressure removes moisture from the granulate and releases it 
into the atmosphere. 

This permanent regeneration of the air drier ensures fault-free operation of the system without the 
need for maintenance work. 


11.4. Operating strategy 

It has been possible to increase the maximum control range in the G05 to 80 mm. Starting from the 
normal position, the customer can adjust the ride height to between -40 mm and +40 mm, to adapt to 
external conditions.

11.4.2. Control inhibitors 

The following vehicle conditions prevent a change in ride height: 

• Brake test stand 

• Transport mode 

• Stored speed thresholds 

• Increased lateral or longitudinal dynamics 

• Flat tire 


54 












G05 Powertrain/Chassis 

11. Two-axle Ride Level Control 

• Non-availability due to component protection (component temperatures or pneumatic 
pressures exceeded) 

• Low vehicle voltage in the residing condition (protection against starter operation if insufficient 
energy is available) 

• Doors open 

• Electrical connector of trailer tow hitch inserted. 

The control inhibitors prevent damage to the vehicle, among other things, due to incorrect operation. 

At higher payloads with air suspension strut pressures of more than 9 bar, the high level is not available 
due to component protection. 

11.4.3. Speed-dependent ride heights 

When driving without a preset program, the vehicle level is adapted automatically, depending on the 
speed. This reduces drag and increases the driving dynamics of the G05. If the various driving speeds 
are undercut, the previous ride height is set. 

Dynamic level 

If a driving speed of roughly 140 km/h (87 mph) is exceeded, the "Dynamic level" (-10 mm) is set. The 
"Dynamic level" cannot be approached manually and the driver is not notified about this ride height. 

The following table shows the control strategy (hysteresis) of the dynamic level.

manually by pressing the SPORT Driving Experience Control switch or the ride height rocker button, 
irrespective of the speed (from 0 to maximum speed). The LED on the ride height rocker button 
indicates which sport level is activated.

11.4.4. Manually selectable ride heights 

The G05 has 6 different ride heights, 5 of which can be selected manually. Only the "Dynamic level" 
cannot be selected manually by the driver. In addition to changing the ride heights, activation of the 
"High and Offroad level" affects the power transmission of the vehicle (see description of xOffroad 
chassis and suspension package). For this reason the offroad button should only be operated 
when driving in suitable offroad conditions. If the ride height of the vehicle is to be adapted to local 
conditions, this can be requested with the assistance of the ride height rocker button.

Load level 

The load level offers convenient assistance when loading the vehicle. The load level can be activated 
via the following operating elements: 

• Level change rocker button 

• Display Key 

• Load level button. 

The load level is only active when the vehicle is stationary. 

Exiting the speed range 

If the driving level activated via the ride height rocker button (e.g. offroad level 40 mm) is exited due to 
speed, the vehicle level is automatically adjusted according to the setting of the Driving Experience 
Control (normal level with COMFORT and sport level with SPORT). When the speed threshold is 
undercut, the height is not raised again automatically. 

If the driving level activated via the offroad button (e.g. offroad level 40 mm) is exited due to speed, the 
next driving level down (high level 20 mm) is automatically set. When the speed falls below the defined 
threshold again, the vehicle is automatically raised.

11.4.6. Water crossing detection 

The water crossing detection is primarily required by the engine control unit DME. If a water crossing 
is detected, the engine control unit DME closes the air flaps. This reduces the danger of water ingress 
in the intake area. As fluids cannot be compressed, intake of water would lead to engine damage. 

A water crossing is detected via the signal shape of the 4 ride height sensors. By analyzing the 
characteristic current and voltage curve, conclusions can be drawn regarding a passage through 
stretch of water. 

To avoid incorrect adjustments to the air suspension during a water crossing, this is deactivated when 
a water crossing is detected.

G05 Powertrain/Chassis 

11. Two-axle Ride Level Control 


When driving through a body of water, a small bow wave forms in the front section. This causes 
the vehicle to float slightly. As the wheels drop down when this happens, the ride heights of the 
corresponding axle change. Without the water crossing detection, the air suspension would release 
pressure in the air suspension strut in order to adjust the ride height. This would cause the vehicle to 
sink even lower. 

The engine control unit DME sends the information regarding a water crossing to the electronic ride 
height control (EHC). The control of the air suspension is subsequently deactivated for the duration of 
the water crossing. 

11.4.7. Touchdown detection 

The air suspension is equipped with a touchdown detection for driving offroad. This counteracts the 
reduced traction which occurs when several wheels lose contact with the ground. 

If touchdown is detected via the ride heights accompanied by wheel slip, the level changes to a 
maximum ride height of +70 mm. This can lead to an improved wheel load distribution and allow free 
travel. This is not a driving level. When the touchdown detection is active, the vehicle level cannot 
be controlled manually. When a driving speed of 10 km/h (6 mph)is exceeded, the vehicle is lowered 
automatically. The driver can then access the control of the various vehicle levels manually.

11.4.8. Tire load removal function 

When a flat tire is detected, the DSC control unit transfers this information to the EHC control unit. 
The EHC control unit then attempts to relieve the load on the relevant wheel. This can extend the 
remaining mileage of the defective run-flat tire. To achieve this, a tire load removal of +20 mm and - 
20 mm is set at the rear axle. This results in a total value of 40 mm for the differential level at the rear 
axle. 

When a tire load removal function is active, the vehicle is always at the normal level. If this is not 
selected when the tire goes flat, it is automatically set. When the tire unloading function is active, 
the driver cannot gain manual access in order to change the vehicle level.

Trailer operation with G05 


Trailer towing 

As soon as a trailer is connected to the vehicle via the trailer socket, the air suspension can no longer 
be operated, e.g. via the ride height rocker button. During trailer operation, the control of the air 
suspension is limited exclusively to adjusting the load statuses at the normal level. 

Activating the trailer operation manually 

When connecting a trailer to the vehicle using a trailer without a light connection to the vehicle, the 
trailer mode needs to be activated manually in the 
Central Information Display (CID).

System limitations when trailer operation is activated 

When trailer mode operation is activated manually or automatically when the trailer connection is 
connected to the vehicle, the following system limitations exist: 

• Opening of the tailgate via the ID transmitter or button in the driver's door is disabled 

• Park Distance Control (PDC) rear deactivated 

• Emergency braking function with Active PDC deactivated 

• Level change of air suspension disabled 

• Lane change warning 

• Blind spot detection 


11.5. Notes for Service 


11.5.1. Transport mode 

The air suspension is in transport mode when new vehicles are delivered. A change in the ride height 
is not possible. Transport mode must be deleted using the workshop information system ISTA during 
the pre-delivery check. The different ride heights of the air suspension can be selected only after 
successful start-up of the air suspension (transport mode deleted). 


11.5.2. Vehicle lift mode 

The air suspension is equipped with a vehicle lift detection system. This prevents control action of the 
air suspension when the vehicle is lifted in the workshop. To activate the control of the air suspension 
after exiting the vehicle lift, the vehicle must be moved faster than 6 km/h (4 mph). 

Vehicle lift detection 

The vehicle lift detection is evaluated via the following signals: 

• Driving speed 

• Height level, ride height sensor. 


A_ 

When supporting the vehicle, e.g. on a vehicle lift, make sure that the components and lines of the air 
suspension system are not crushed or damaged. 


11.5.3. Jack 

Before using a jack, it is advisable to deactivate the self-levelling suspension (see Owner's Handbook). 


64 





G05 Powertrain/Chassis 

11. Two-axle Ride Level Control 

11.5.4. Workshop mode 

Activating the workshop mode 

The control of the air suspension can be deactivated manually in workshop mode. This can be 
activated by pressing the ride level rocker button for longer than 7 s. When doing so, whether the ride 
level rocker button is pushed forwards or backwards is irrelevant. The LED on the ride level rocker 
button goes out to confirm workshop mode. 

The workshop mode is required for example when performing a wheel alignment in order to prevent 
adjustments by the air suspension. BMW Group vehicles equipped with a rear axle air suspension 
do not feature a ride height selection switch. To prevent control actions in these vehicle models, the 
vehicle battery must be disconnected for example. 

Exiting workshop mode 

To activate the control of the air suspension, the workshop mode must be deactivated. 

This can be done as follows: 

• Driving speed higher than 6 km/h (4 mph) 

• Hold ride height rocker button pressed for longer than 7 s. 


11.5.5. Swapping of air lines 

If the compressed air lines are swapped round, the vehicle will tilt permanently as a result. It will no 
longer be possible to adjust the system when the lines are swapped. To prevent confusion during 
installation work in service, the compressed air lines are color coded.

11.5.6. Servicing of the pneumatic system 

Ensure strict cleanliness around the air spring connections during disassembly and installation work. 
Minor contamination within the lines may already cause air suspension faults.

Before opening the compressed air lines, the air spring system must be depressurised with the 
assistance of the workshop information system ISTA.

11. Two-axle Ride Level Control 


When exchanging the air supply unit, the entire system must be depressurized. This is performed 
using a service function in the workshop information system ISTA. To prevent damage to the air 
suspension, a slight pressure of roughly 2 bar is maintained in the air suspension struts via the residual 
pressure maintaining valves. 

The graphic above only shows the release of compressed air from the air suspension struts. The 
pressure in the pressure accumulator is also dumped via the service function. 

A_ 

For the valid procedure for exchanging the various components of the air suspension, refer to the 
current repair instructions. 


Once an air line has been detached, all openings must be closed immediately. If dirt enters the 
pneumatic system, this can lead to faults or a system failure the cause of which can only be diagnosed 
with difficulty. 

11.5.7. Ride height adjustment 

After renewing or programming the Vertical Dynamic Platform (VDP) control unit, the ride heights 
of the two-axle ride level control must be taught in again. This is performed via the "ride height 
adjustment" service function. To do this, the distance between the wheel arch and rim flange must be 
measured with a tape measure and entered in the workshop information system ISTA.

11.5.8. Leakages 

After longer stationary periods, the vehicle may reach a low level due to leakage. To prevent damage 
due to reduced underbody clearance, the driver receives a corresponding Check Control message. 


67 


















G05 Powertrain/Chassis 

11. Two-axle Ride Level Control 


Leakages are equalized as effectively as possible within 32 h via the wake-up control. For this, the 
vehicle wakes up at various time intervals and adjusts the ride height if necessary. 

Troubleshooting procedure if a leakage is suspected: 

• Adjust and note maximum storage pressure of the pressure accumulator with assistance of 
workshop information system ISTA 

• Deactivate air suspension (workshop mode) 

• Search for leak (check components using leak detection spray) 

• Determine storage pressure again after some time and check plausibility. 


11.5.9. Display Key 

The Display Key in the G05 contains various display menus, which depend on the vehicle equipment. 
When ordering a Display Key using the vehicle identification number, this is preconfigured in the BMW 
central warehouse according to the vehicle equipment. Every vehicle is therefore equipped with a user 
menu which is adapted to the equipment specification. The customer can use this kind of menu to 
change the vehicle level of his air suspension, for example. This kind of menu is on the other hand not 
displayed in vehicles without air suspension. 

Lowering to the load level via the Display Key is only possible from the normal level. 

The function Change vehicle level via Display Key will be available from December 2018.

12. Brakes 


The G05 is the first BMW Group vehicle to be equipped with a newly developed integrated brake 
system. The core element of the brake is the Dynamic Stability Control integrated DSCi. What sets 
this brake system apart from the others is the omission of vacuum supply and brake servo. This is an 
electro-hydraulic brake-by-wire brake system which determines the braking requirement of the driver 
and adjusts the hydraulic brake pressure accordingly. During normal operation the driver has no direct 
connection in the brake hydraulics to the wheel brakes. A brake force simulator generates a familiar 
brake pedal feel. Feedback from the brake hydraulics that typically occurs during ABS or DSC control 
operations, are not perceived by the driver.

13.1.1. Puncture 

Continued driving with depressurized run-flat tires with medium load is permitted up to a maximum 
speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) for roughly 80 km (50 miles). 

Wheel load removal 

The wheel load removal function is used in the following systems to extend the range of the run-flat 
tires in the event of a flat tire: 

• Electric active roll stabilization EARS 

• Two-axle ride level control. 

A damaged run-flat tire can be also replaced in emergencies with a normal tire which should then be 
replaced as soon as possible with a run-flat tire.

Wheel with tire 


Customers with offroad requirements can now for the first time obtain a special wheel set from BMW 
to increase offroad capability. The wheel set cannot be ordered from the factory but only available 
through Aftersales. It has the characteristics of an all-season tire and can therefore be used by the 
customer not only for offroad driving but also as a fully-fledged winter tire set. The special grabber AT3 
tire tread offers the perfect combination of offroad capability and good drivability on the road. 

13.2.1. Technical data 

The grabber AT3 tire has the following identification marks: 

• Mud and Snow (M+S) 

• Three-Peak-Snowflake. 

It is therefore a fully-fledged winter tire. 

The offroad tire has no star identification. Following extensive testing by the wheel and tire 
development division however, it has been possible to provide a marketing recommendation. The 
assistance systems available from BMW can also be used without restriction in combination with the 
offroad wheel set.

13.2.2. Grabber AT3 tire tread 

Traction on every surface 

Due to the large number of gripping edges in the tire tread, the tire interlocks with the loose surface 
and effectively transmits the drive and brake forces. 

The open tread shoulder ensures efficient self-cleaning and additional traction in mud. 

Protective functions 



Sidewall lugs 


Deflection ribs 


Rim protection rib 


Solid blocks running from the tire shoulder into the side wall protect this area from lateral damage by 
stones, rocks and rubble. 

The deflection ribs attached to the sides repel foreign bodies and therefore prevent foreign bodies 
from penetrating the upper side wall area. 

The rim protection rib protects the tire and wheel rim in the bead area from damage by curbs and 
obstacles during offroad use.

With the introduction of the DSCi, a completely new braking concept is available to BMW customers 

which has a significant effect on driving dynamics. 

14.3.1. Features 

The brake system is distinguished by the following driving characteristics in particular: 

• Outstanding driving dynamics and vehicle control due to the dynamics and precision of the 
vehicle stabilization. 

• More sporting character and feeling of safety due to a brake pedal feel short travel and 
effective modulation. 

• Enhanced active safety thanks to shorter stopping distances in combination with assistance 
systems. 

• Due to the fast pressure build-up, much faster and more precise interventions can be achieved 
compared to previous brake systems.

14.3.3. Brake functions 


Function 

Explanation 

Antilock Brake 
System (ABS) 

Prevents locking of individual wheels when braking by means of targeted 
modulation of brake pressures. Vehicle steerability is maintained. 

Cornering Brake 
Control (CBC) 

Prevents the vehicle from turning in when braking gently and when 
subjected to a high degree of lateral acceleration by adjusting the control of 
the brake pressures. The cornering stability is improved. 

Automatic Stability 
Control (ASC) 

Prevents the drive wheels from spinning by targeted braking of these 
wheels and adaptation of the drive torque delivered by the engine. Vehicle 
propulsion is optimized as a result and driving stability is maintained. 

Dynamic Brake 
Control (DBC) 

In the event of panic braking initiated by the driver, the system supports the 
driver by automatically immediately applying the maximum brake pressure 
to ensure the best possible deceleration. 

Dynamic Stability 
Control (DSC) 

If the vehicle starts to understeer or oversteer, it is stabilized by targeted 
brake interventions at individual wheels. 


84 











G05 Powertrain/Chassis 

14. Driving Stability Control 


Function 

Explanation 

Automatic 

Differential Brake 
(ADB-X) 

Simulates the function of the differential lock. If a wheel displays a 
tendency to spin, this wheel is automatically braked so that forward 
momentum can still be achieved via the other wheel of the driven axle. 

Dynamic Traction 
Control (DTC) 

Represents a special mode of the Dynamic Stability Control integrated 

DSCi. 

Brake standby 

Builds up a moderate brake pressure in the system when the driver takes 
his foot off the accelerator pedal quickly. The braking effect then acts more 
quickly if the driver then performs panic braking. 

Dry by applying 
brake 

Depending on whether the wiper is switched on, applies the brake pads 
gently at intervals in order to clean (dry) the brake discs. The braking effect 
is significantly improved by this when the vehicle is braked. 

Drive-off assistant 

Holds the vehicle on inclines for roughly 1.5 seconds as soon as the driver 
releases the brake pedal in order to drive off. This means that the driver 
can drive off comfortably, without the vehicle rolling back down the hill 
unintentionally. 

Automatic Hold 

Automatically holds the vehicle after it has come to a standstill without it 
being necessary to still press the brake when the drive position is selected. 
The brake is automatically released when the accelerator pedal is pressed 
and the vehicle drives off normally. The function can be switched on and off 
by means of a button.

14.4. Vehicle dynamics functions 


Agility and 
manoeuvrability 

System 

Description 

Dynamic driving 
rear axle steering 

-HSR 

Through a systematic steering wheel movement, the agility 
and manoeuvrability in the low speed range can be improved 
by countersteering the wheels of the rear axle. By aligning the 
rear axle wheels in the same direction at high driving speeds 
increases the driving stability. 

Driving dynamic 
limit range 
response 

-EPS 

The limit range response influences the steering torques to be 
applied by the driver so that the transition from stable driving to 
oversteer or understeer situations is better perceived.

Stabilization 
and traction 

System 

Description 

Cornering 

Steering 

Behavior 

-EARS 

Selective influencing of the rolling moment relationship 
between front and rear axles can produce a stabilizing or more 
dynamic characteristic in the vehicle's self-steering response. 

Cornering 

Traction Control 

-EARS 

Influencing the rolling moment relationships between front and 
rear axle is used to improve the traction when cornering. 

Yaw-rate control, 
rear axle 

-HSR 

Systematic steering wheel movements of the rear axle in 
oversteering and understeering situations stabilizes the 
vehicle. 

Yaw moment 
compensation, 
rear axle 

-HSR 

The yaw movement of the vehicle arising under heavy and 
varying braking coefficients of friction between the left-hand 
and right-hand sides of the vehicle is compensated for by 
selective steering movements on the rear axle. 

Yaw moment 
compensation, 
front axle 

-EPS 

Targeted steering moment interventions by the Electronic 

Power Steering EPS in the event of heavy braking with different 
coefficients of friction between the left and right vehicle sides 
provide the driver with information about the steering input 
required to compensate for developing yaw movement of the 
vehicle. 

Performance 

Control 

- DSCi 

The tendency of the vehicle to oversteer or understeer is 
reduced by selective brake interventions on individual wheels. 

At the same time, the vehicle deceleration caused by the brake 
intervention is furthermore compensated for by increasing the 
engine torque. 

Driving dynamic 
total drive torque 
intervention 

- DME 

Regulating the drive torque within limits on the basis of the 
estimated coefficient of friction to avoid uncomfortable jumps 
during ASC control. 

Transverse
