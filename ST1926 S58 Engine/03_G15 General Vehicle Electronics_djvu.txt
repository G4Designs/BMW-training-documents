The local CAN bus systems are not all shown in the overview during a diagnosis. 


2.4. LIN bus 

A multitude of LIN buses are used in the G15. 2 particular LIN buses are the LIN bus for the integrated 
automatic heating/air conditioning system and the LIN bus for the ambient lighting. Both LIN buses 
are arranged in series. If the LIN bus is interrupted at a particular point, no communication with 
subsequent components is possible from this point. 

A simplified system wiring diagram is shown below for the ambient lighting.

control unit. The purpose of the ZGM is to connect all the bus systems to each other. By connecting 
them in this way, it is possible to use information from the individual bus systems on a generalized 
level. The central gateway module is able to implement different protocols and speeds on other bus 
systems. The programming data for the control units is transmitted by Ethernet to the vehicle via the 
ZGM.

• 2 relays, terminal 30B 

• 2 relays, terminal 30F 

• 1 relay, rear window heating. 

All the relays are bi-stable. The relays are activated by the Body Domain Controller via a LIN bus. The 
luggage compartment power distribution box controls the terminal 30B relays of the two front power 
distribution boxes. 

Body Domain Controller 

A terminal 30F relay is installed in the Body Domain Controller (BDC). 

A number of consumers are supplied via the BDC with terminal 30 and terminal 30F. 

4.2.6. Power Control Unit with vehicle electrical system support 

Present-day vehicles have a high energy consumption due to the many electrical consumers. As a 
result, there is a high demand on the vehicle battery particularly in phases in which the combustion 
engine is not running and the alternator is not supplying any power (e.g. engine start-stop phases). 

In order to protect the vehicle battery, the G15 is fitted with DC/DC converter in the Power Control Unit 
(PCU) and an auxiliary battery. 


44 







G15 General Vehicle Electronics 

4. Voltage Supply 

The preconditions for the direction of the energy management are calculated from the use of the 
vehicle. When the engine is running the auxiliary battery is charged from the conventional vehicle 
electrical system. During the phases in which the combustion engine is not running, the energy is 
supplied from the auxiliary battery to the conventional vehicle electrical system. 

A control unit which is connected to the PT-CAN2 is integrated in the PCU. A DC/DC converter with 
output of 500 W is also integrated.

5.2. Partial network operation 

Present-day vehicles contain up to 70 control units with well over 100 microcontrollers which are 
networked with each other. Depending on the current vehicle condition, not all comfort and assistance 
systems are always required. 

Through the targeted cutting out and cutting in of control units that are not required, it is possible to 
save energy and thus relieve the strain on the battery. 

5.2.1. Control units 

Different transceivers are used in the control units in order to realize partial network operation. These 
transceivers are able to evaluate and interpret messages. This control unit remains switched off as 
long as any bus communication takes place without a valid wake-up event for the control unit being 
present. If a wake-up event is transmitted on the corresponding bus, the transceiver can activate the 
microcontroller's voltage regulator and the control unit starts up. 

Certain control units on the Ethernet require a separate wake-up via the terminal 15 wake-up line for 
starting up. 

5.2.2. Residing 

If e.g. the radio is being listened to in the vehicle condition, only the bus system to which the radio 
function is connected is active. The other bus systems are woken up only when a further function, 
such as e.g. seat heating, is required.

The alarm system is equipped with an ultrasonic interior movement detector for monitoring the 
passenger compartment. This is integrated in the roof function center. 

The Body Domain Controller monitors the door contacts, the bonnet switches and the tailgate. As 
soon as a status changes, the ultrasonic interior movement detector receives this information via the 
K-CAN2. When the alarm system is activated, an alarm is set off by the siren with tilt alarm sensor 
(SINE) in the event of a break-in. 

The siren with tilt alarm sensor (SINE) is connected to the roof function center via a LIN bus. 

The status of the alarm system is displayed via an LED in the interior mirror.

The ambient lighting comprises 11 predefined light designs. 

During an incoming phone call the ambient lighting flashes at a specified frequency. 

The ambient lighting is activated when the vehicle is unlocked or locked. 

RGB LEDs (Red, Green, Blue) are used for the ambient lighting. The lighting is controlled via 
a separate LIN bus. Here the individual LED modules are connected in series. If the LIN bus is 
interrupted at a point, the lighting is interrupted at this point. A search for the fault must be carried out 
at the location where the last LED illuminates.

13.3. Functions 

13.3.1. Impact detection 

The US version of the vehicles is equipped with the following sensors: 

• one lateral and one longitudinal acceleration sensor in the B-pillars (green) 

• one airbag sensor to monitor the pressure in each of the front doors (blue) 

• one lateral and one longitudinal acceleration sensor in the ACSM (yellow) 

• one roll rate sensor in the ACSM (yellow) 

• one vertical acceleration sensor in the ACSM (yellow) 

• one airbag front sensor each on the engine supports (red) 

The airbag sensors in the doors assist with the identification of a side-on crash. 

The airbag front sensors assist with the identification of a head-on crash and its corresponding 
severity.
