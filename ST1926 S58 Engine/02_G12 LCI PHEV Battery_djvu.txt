The above list shows the high-voltage battery of battery generation 3.0. In case of potential defects, 
the generation 3.0 high-voltage battery unit can be repaired, in contrast to generation 1.0 to 
generation 2.0, which needed to be completely replaced. 

2.1.2. High-voltage battery generation 4.0 

With the G12 LCI PHEV, the high-voltage battery generation 4.0 is deployed for the first time. The 
basic layout of the lithium-ion battery is same as that for the high-voltage battery of the G12 PHEV 
and the G30 PHEV. It lays the foundation stone for a number of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles which 
above all have greater ranges than their predecessors. The most significant change compared to the 
predecessor is that the cell capacity has been increased from 26 Ah to 34 Ah.

The majority of specifications on the type plate are individual for each high-voltage battery, for example 
serial number and production date. It is therefore necessary to specify these individual specifications 
when ordering a replacement type plate.

New is the bus structure of the local CAN1 and the division of the cell supervision circuits into primary 
and secondary control units. Communication between the battery management electronics (SME) 
and cell supervision circuits takes place exclusively through the primary cell supervision circuit. The 
remaining cell supervision circuits (secondaries) only communicate with one another and the primary 
cell supervision circuit. 

2.2.3. Safety box 

With the new high-voltage battery of generation 4.0, the safety box has been revised and adapted. The 
higher energy content of the high-voltage battery means that the inner components of the safety box 
(generation 4.0) have been configured for higher currents. These include: 

• The electromagnetic switch contactor 

• The pre-charging relay 


A_ 

The safety boxes of generation 3.0 and 4.0 cannot be distinguished from the outside and must not 
be confused. The safety box of generation 3.0 must not be installed in a high-voltage battery of 
generation 4.0 (and vice versa). Make sure that the correct part is selected. An incorrectly installed 
safety box is only detected during the EoS test and therefore leads to high overhead for rework. 


2.2.4. Cell supervision circuits 

The structure of the local CAN1 has been changed. The 6 cell supervision circuits with equal rights are 
no longer deployed, rather 1 primary cell supervision circuit (black) and 5 secondary cell supervision 
circuits connected in series (grey). 


14

In this way, a series connection principle leads to advantages, but also disadvantages (in comparison 
with the CAN structure of the high-voltage battery generation 3.0): 

Advantages 

• Cost reduction of the secondary cell supervision circuits, as complex printed circuit boards are 
not required 

• Greater reliability resulting from the reduction in number of components 

• Separate recording and transmission of the serial number no longer necessary when 
exchanging a cell supervision circuit. 


16 














































G12 LCI PHEV High-voltage Battery 

2. High-voltage Battery 

Disadvantage 

• In the event of failure of a secondary cell supervision circuit, communication with the upstream 
secondary cell supervision circuits is no longer possible. All of the upstream secondary cell 
supervision circuits fail. 

• This means that further failure of an upstream secondary cell supervision circuit can only be 
identified when the first fault has been remedied. 

In the high-voltage batteries of generation 3.0, exchanged cell supervision circuits arranged 
themselves in random order with their serial numbers at the SME during their first start-up. It was only 
possible to ensure unambiguous assignment of the exchanged cell supervision circuits in the SME 
with manual input of the position and serial number via ISTA. 

In the new high-voltage battery generation 4.0, this manual input of installation position and serial 
number is not required. The location determination of an exchanged secondary cell supervision circuit 
is performed automatically by the primary cell supervision circuit, which detects the position of the 
secondary cell supervision circuit on the basis of its position (order) in the CSC wiring harness. 

An exchanged primary cell supervision circuit also detects its position automatically and reports this to 
the SME. 

CSC wiring harness 

In contrast to the predecessor battery, the CSC wiring harness is designed in the warning color 
orange. The reason for this is the fact that a defective cell supervision circuit can mean that the 
high voltage of the respective cell module is applied on the CSC wiring harness. During trouble-free 
operation, there is no high voltage on the CSC vehicle wiring harness.

3. Repair 

3.1. General information 

A_ 

The following description of the repair of the high-voltage battery unit is only a general list of the 
content and the procedure. In general, only the specifications and instructions in the current 
valid edition of the repair instructions apply. 


A_ 

Make sure that the correct part is selected within the framework of repairs. The inner components of 
the high-voltage battery generation 4.0 are not compatible with generation 3.0. Mixed installation is 
not permitted. The 34 Ah cell modules may only be used in high-voltage batteries of generation 4.0. 
Conversion of a high-voltage battery of generation 3.0 with 34 Ah cell modules is not permitted. 


A_ 

Before starting work on high-voltage vehicles that have been involved in an accident, the instructions 
and notices in the following documents in the repair instructions must be observed: 

• Safety information for handling electric vehicles 

• Assessment of vehicle that has been involved in an accident 

• Visual inspection of high-voltage battery unit after an accident. 


3.2. Exchange of the cell supervision circuit 

When cell supervision circuits are exchanged, it is no longer necessary to enter the serial number and 
installation position in the printed report and the SME (see subchapter "Cell supervision circuits"). 


18

3. Repair 



G12 LCI PHEV Cell supervision circuits 


Index Explanation 



The numbering of the cell modules remains unchanged. Cell module 1 is the cell module that forms 
the negative terminal of the high-voltage battery. The counting order of the other cell modules is 
numerical. This means that cell module 6 is the cell module that forms the positive terminal. 


The numbering of the cell supervision circuits remains unchanged. The primary cell supervision circuit 
may only be connected at cell module 1. 


19

3. Repair 

3.3. CSC wiring harness 

The specified attachment points of the CSC wiring harness must be used. A deviation in the routing 
can diminish the electromagnetic compatibility. 


3.4. Cell module exchange 

The elements contained in the cells make the cell module a valuable component. In order to minimize 
the number of exchanged cell modules and improve the tracking of reuse, there are a number of new 
features. 


3.4.1. Reuse 

In some high-voltage vehicles with certain software versions, the entire high-voltage path must be 
replaced after the safety fuse (in the safety box) has triggered. To this end, the following components 
are output within the framework of diagnosis: 

• All high-voltage cables 

• The safety box 

• All cell modules. 

This applies to the following vehicles and integration levels: 

• G12 PHEV and G30 PHEV (high-voltage battery SP06) and integration level before July 2018. 

This leads to high costs. For this reason, the SME software has been extended and now has a counter 
that takes account of and counts the triggering of the safety fuse. Every time the safety fuse is 
triggered, a 'T is added to the counter reading. It is only when the counter reading reaches '2' that all 
cell modules have to be exchanged. 

• First-time triggering of the fuse (counter reading 1) 

Exchange of all high-voltage cables and the safety box 

• Renewed triggering of the fuse (counter reading 2) 

Exchange of all high-voltage cables, the safety box and all cell modules. 

This applies to the following vehicles and integration levels: 

• G12 PHEV and G30 PHEV (high-voltage battery SP06) and integration level as of July 2018 

• G12 LCI PHEV (high-voltage battery SP41). 

This means it can occur within the framework of diagnosis, depending on the vehicle and software 
version, that the cell modules are specified as components to be exchanged or not. 

A_ 

Within the framework of repair, the diagnosis outputs a list of which components must be replaced. 
This list must be complied with at all times. 


20 




G12 LCI PHEV High-voltage Battery 

3. Repair 

The counter reading is not visible in ISTA and is automatically reset within the framework of the 
diagnostic function when the repair is completed. Manual resetting is not possible. 

On exchange of the SME, the counter reading of the new SME is adopted. However, this only takes 
place in the case of a control unit exchange guided by means of ISTA. 

3.4.2. Tracking 

When a cell module is exchanged, the serial number of the new cell modules must be transferred 
into ISTA within the framework of the service function. What is new is that the serial numbers of the 
exchanged cell modules also have to be transferred into ISTA. In this way, the exchanged cell modules 
are also entered in ISTA. 

In order to be able to adjust the input of the cell module serial numbers more flexibly to the workflow, 
there is a new service function that does not require any vehicle communication. This enables the 
service function "High-voltage battery unit: document serial number of cell module" to be executed 
when the high-voltage battery is still removed, open and the serial numbers are easily accessible. This 
is possible, for example, by reopening the last ISTA operation of the associated vehicle. 

If the input of the serial numbers has taken place using this service function, this does not have to be 
done again within the framework of commissioning. 

3.4.3. State of charge synchronization 

Before the installation of a new cell module, its state of charge is brought to the level of the remaining 
cell modules, which was read out beforehand. The familiar module charger is used for this. 



G12 LCI PHEV Cell module charging cable 

In comparison with the predecessor cell modules, the module charging cable with special tool number 
2 458 279 must be used. 

The software of the module charger has been adapted for various climates. This means it is possible to 
adapt the cell module voltage over a greater temperature range. 

Temperature range: 

41 °F to 113 °F (previously 59 °F to 104 °F)

3.5. EoS tester 

Before installation into the vehicle, the high-voltage battery must be tested in the familiar manner 
using the EoS tester. The changes of the EoS tester are only related to the software. The connections, 
procedure and operation are unchanged for the G12 LCI PHEV. In the same way as all other plug-in 
hybrid electric vehicles, the blue clamping bell with the round seal is to be used for the venting unit.
