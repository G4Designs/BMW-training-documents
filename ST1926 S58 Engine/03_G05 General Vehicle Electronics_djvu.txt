Digital Motor Electronics (DME2) (only 8-cylinder engines) 


The FlexRay overview includes all engine versions and optional equipment. The DME1 (no. 1) is 
present for 6-cylinder engines. On 8-cylinder engines the DME2 (no. 13) and DME1 (no. 1) are 
present. The terminating resistors for line termination are located in the control units and in the Body 
Domain Controller. 

The FlexRay has a data transfer rate of 10 MBit/s. 


2.2.4. Ethernet 

Two different Ethernet versions of the are used. Thus, in the G05, the variant with 5 lines (4 data lines 
and 1 activation line) is used for the OBD2 interface to the Body Domain Controller. Diagnosis and 
programming of the connected control units are performed via the Ethernet. 

The second variant is already familiar from the G12 and is used as 2-wire OABR Ethernet (Open 
Alliance BroadR-Reach). 

Control units on the 2-wire OABR Ethernet: 

• Camera-based driver assistance systems (KAFAS) 

• Top Rear Side View Camera (TRSVC) 

• Head Unit High (HU-H) 

• Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE) 

• Optional equipment system (SAS) 

• Telematic Communication Box 2 (TCB2) 

• Receiver Audio Module (RAM) 

• Front radar sensor long range (FRSF).

G05 General Vehicle Electronics 

2. Bus Systems 

The standard "Open Alliance BroadR-Reach" (OABR Ethernet) has been specially developed as a new 
data transmission layer for use in vehicles. OABR Ethernet only requires an unshielded twisted two- 
wire connection. OABR Ethernet supports bidirectional 100 MBit/s communication between 2 nodes. 
This means that both nodes can simultaneously send and receive at a data transfer rate of 100 MBit/ 
s. OABR Ethernet requires point-to-point networking. This means that the bus system is not split up 
between multiple nodes, as is the case e.g. with the CAN (Controller Area Network). Instead, Ethernet 
switches are used for the connection of further nodes. Today, Ethernet switches are integrated in the 
following control units: Body Domain Controller (BDC), head unit (HU), optional equipment system 
(SAS), top rear side view camera (TRSVC). 

A 

A wake-up line may be required for control units that are only connected to the Ethernet and are not 
additionally connected to a K-CAN. 


Control units on the Ethernet cannot be woken up via the bus. Instead, the control units are activated 
via the wake-up line or switched directly via terminal 15.

2.2.5. D-CAN 

The D-CAN is still needed for control units which do not have an Ethernet connection for diagnosis. 
The D-CAN has a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s. 

Diagnosis and programming of the connected control units are performed via the D-CAN. 


2.3. Sub-bus systems 

The sub-bus systems on the one hand relieve the load on the main bus systems and on the other hand 
do not require a high data transfer rate. 


2.3.1. LIN bus 

For a better overview, the LIN buses are divided up between several wiring diagrams for the G05.

• AGM starter battery in the luggage compartment with 90 Ah or 105 Ah 

• Auxiliary AGM battery in the engine compartment with 60 Ah 

• Lithium ion auxiliary battery in the engine compartment with 10 Ah 

An auxiliary battery in the engine compartment is used to provide assistance for the vehicle electrical 
system. On vehicles with electric active roll stabilization, the two anti-roll bar actuators are also 
supplied with power by this battery. 

The dual storage system is used in vehicles without active roll stabilization; a 10 Ah lithium ion battery 
is installed parallel to the AGM battery. 

The dual storage system is used for the first time in the US market. 

A_ 

Detailed information on the battery and the dual storage system can be found in the document 
"General Vehicle Electronics 2018" 


4.2.4. Intelligent battery sensor 

The IBS records the following data of the 12V battery: 

• Voltage 

• Current 

• Pole temperature. 

The IBS performs the calculation and the evaluation of the information. The results are then forwarded 
via the LIN bus to the higher-level control units (Electrical Digital Motor Electronics and Body Domain 
Controller).

Safety battery terminal 


The safety battery terminal (SBK) is activated in the event of an accident of corresponding severity. 
The voltage supply to the positive battery connection point in the engine compartment is interrupted 
and the consumers connected to this are de-energized. The safety battery terminal is installed in the 
power distribution box next to the battery. 

4.2.6. AGLR alternator 

Alternators with increased efficiency (active alternator power regulation) are used in the G05. The 
increase in alternator efficiency is achieved by reducing the losses in the rectifier. The loss-causing 
diodes are replaced by actively activated MOSFET transistors. A reduction in fuel consumption is 
achieved by increasing the efficiency. 

Different alternators are used depending on the engine type and vehicle equipment. 

Versions: 

• Bosch with 180 A and 250 A for 6-cylinder engine 

• Valeo with 250 A for 8-cylinder engine

A number of consumers are supplied with terminal 30 and terminal 30F and provided with 
corresponding fuse protection via the BDC. 

4.2.12. PCU with vehicle electrical system assistance measure 



PCU 


Modern vehicles have a high energy consumption due to the many electrical consumers. As a result, 
there is a high demand on the battery, particularly in phases in which the combustion engine is not 
running and the alternator supplies no energy (e.g. engine start-stop phases). 

In order to protect the vehicle battery, a DC/DC converter is installed in the Power Control Unit (PCU) 
and an auxiliary battery in the engine compartment in the G05. 


65 


G05 General Vehicle Electronics 

4. Voltage Supply 

The preconditions for the direction of the energy management are calculated from the use of the 
vehicle. When the engine is running the auxiliary battery is charged from the conventional vehicle 
electrical system. During the phases in which the combustion engine is not running, e.g. automatic 
engine start-stop function, the energy is supplied from the auxiliary battery into the conventional 
vehicle electrical system. 

The Power Control Unit (PCU) contains a control unit which is connected to the PT-CAN2 and a DC/ 
DC converter with a power of 500 W. 

In vehicles with the electric active roll stabilization equipment this is supplied by the AGM 60 Ah 
auxiliary battery in the engine compartment.

5. Terminal Control 

5.1. Introduction 

The terminal control in the G05 is identical to the terminal control of the G12. In the G05, the vehicle 
is always in the right condition from the point of view of the customer. The terminals are controlled 
via a customer-oriented condition management. The terminal control is dependent on the vehicle 
conditions. 


5.2. Vehicle conditions 

The G05 vehicle may be in the following conditions: 

• PARKING 

• RESIDING 

• DRIVING 

The different vehicle functions are possible depending on the relevant conditions. 

PARKING 

• Customer not in the vehicle. 

• Vehicle secured or not used for a certain time. 

• Vehicle functions cannot be operated. 

RESIDING 

• Customer in the vehicle. 

• No driving readiness. 

• Functions that are relevant when the vehicle is stationary can be operated. 

DRIVING 

• Customer in the vehicle. 

• Driving readiness established. 

• All functions are available. 

The vehicle conditions are changed by condition management, taking into account the customer 
behavior. Additional information is also evaluated that may help to determine the vehicle condition, 
e.g.: 

• Door opening. 

• Door closing. 

• Operations in the vehicle.

G05 General Vehicle Electronics 

5. Terminal Control 

5.3. Power supply terminals 

Control units in the vehicle must be supplied with power only when they are needed. The following 
terminals are used in the G05: 

• Terminal 15N 

• Terminal 30B 

• Terminal 30F 

• Terminal 30. 

Terminal 15N supplies control units which are needed only when driving and which may be needed to 
safely end a journey. After-run of 5 s starts at the transition from DRIVING to RESIDING. 

Terminal 30B is used to supply control units that are needed in the stationary mode in the condition 
RESIDING and for stationary functions where the customer is not in the vehicle. An after-run of 
6 minutes starts at the transition from RESIDING to PARKING, and terminal 30B is then switched off. 

Terminal 30F is used to supply control units which must perform functions in PARKING condition. 
Terminal 30F is normally switched on in PARKING condition, but may be switched off due to faults in 
the vehicle electrical system. Terminal 30F is switched off with an after-running period of 1 minute if a 
fault is detected. 

Terminal 30 control units (e.g. alarm system) are always supplied with voltage and are also not 
switched off in the event of a fault.

Testing-analysis-diagnosis (PAD) mode 

The vehicle condition testing-analysis-diagnosis is still present for diagnosis. All terminals are 
switched on in this mode. This ensures that diagnosis can be performed with all control units. This 
vehicle condition is displayed in the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 

Activation of the PAD mode: 

• Operation of the start/stop button (three times within 0.8 s) + valid remote control or valid ID 
transmitter in the vehicle interior 

• By the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 


71 






G05 General Vehicle Electronics 

5. Terminal Control 

The PAD mode is exited by pressing the start/stop button or by closing the diagnosis with BMW 
diagnosis system ISTA. 


5.4. Partial network operation 

Today's premium vehicles contain up to 70 control units with well over 100 micro controllers which are 
networked with each other. However, depending on the current vehicle condition or the vehicle user 
requirement, not all comfort and assistance systems may always be needed. 

It is possible to save energy, relieve the load on the battery and also prolong the battery life by targeted 
deactivation and activation on control units which are not needed, so-called selective partial network 
operation. 

If functions are not used or needed when driving, e.g.: 

• Seat adjustment 

• Trailer lighting (no trailer attached) 

The corresponding control units can be switched off. 

In vehicles with combustion engine, the electrical energy consumption is indirectly linked to the fuel 
consumption via the alternator. As a result, selective deactivation of control units that are not currently 
needed can contribute to reducing fuel consumption and thus also CO 2 emissions. 


5.4.1. Prerequisites for partial network operation 

The partial network primary in the Body Domain Controller calculates a partial network status on 
the basis of the current vehicle condition and the required functions. The control units that are not 
required are switched off by means of the corresponding bus messages. 

5.4.2. Prerequisites of control units for partial network operation 

Different transceivers are used in order to realize partial network operation in control units. These 
transceivers are able to evaluate and interpret messages. This control unit remains switched off as 
long as any bus communication takes place without a valid wake-up event for the corresponding 
control unit being present. If a valid wake-up event for the corresponding control unit is sent on the 
bus, the transceiver can activate the voltage regulator of the micro controller and the control unit starts 
up. The control unit is switched off by deactivation of the voltage regulator.

RGB (red, green, blue) LED modules are used for the ambient lighting. 


The ambient lighting is controlled via a separate LIN bus. The individual LED modules are connected 
via a local interconnect network bus. The LED modules are connected in series to the LIN bus around 
the vehicle. 

If the LIN bus is interrupted at a certain point or the micro controller on the LED is faulty, then further 
light transmittance is interrupted at this point. A search for the fault must be carried out at the location 
where the last LED illuminates. 

11.2. Speaker illumination 

In a vehicle with a Bowers & Wilkins audio system, the lighting for the speaker trims is activated via the 
Receiver Audio Module (RAM). 

LED modules are used for the speaker cover lighting. 

The lighting is controlled via a local LIN bus by RAM to the LED modules of the speaker trims.

The instrument cluster receives the value of the ambient temperature from the outside temperature 
sensor and makes this available via the PT-CAN. The Body Domain Controller evaluates the signal 
and triggers the activation of the mirror heating via the local interconnect network bus. The control 
of the heater output is dependent on the ambient temperature and the switch position of the driving 
experience switch. 

The mirror servomotors are activated by the mirror electronics. The request for adjusting the exterior 
mirror is received by the mirror electronics via the local interconnect network bus.

13.3. Massage 

8 different massage functions in the backrest and seat cushion are available to activate or relax 
muscles. This allows the back muscles to be relaxed and the strain on the spinal discs to be relieved. 
The 8 programs are divided into 3 categories: 

• Mobilization. 

• Relaxation. 

• Vitalization. 

In the case of mobilization , the strain on the spine is relieved by targeted body movements. 

In the relaxation program, the muscles are relaxed by massage. 

The vitalization program is made up of both mobilization and relaxation. The combination of movement 
and massage ensures relaxation and recuperation particularly on long journeys.

16.2.2. Function 

The function of the central locking system of the G05 is based on that of current BMW models. All 
functions relevant for the central locking system are controlled by the Body Domain Controller. The 
function is as follows: 

• The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the remote control receiver. 

• The signal causes the BDC to activate the central locking system and the interior lighting. 

• The BDC evaluates the status of all the door contacts, the tailgate and the hotel position 
switch. 

• The status of the central locking system button is also evaluated by the BDC. The BDC 
activates the central locking system, depending on the status. 

• The BDC is responsible for activation of the central locking system and the drive for soft-close 
automatic in the tailgate. 

• Activation of fuel filler flap unlocking is also performed by the BDC.

18.2. Functions. 


18.2.1. System monitoring functions 

Deactivation of airbags 

Provision is made in US versions of the vehicles for the airbag to be deactivated automatically in order 
to satisfy the regulations of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA. When the child 
seats listed in the regulation are occupied by a child this must lead to deactivation of the airbag. 

To do so, a seat occupancy mat is used on the front passenger seat for the purpose of occupancy 
detection and classification of occupants in the front passenger seat. A Capacitive Interior Sensing 
mat (CIS mat) is used in the G05. 

The CIS mat is made up of two elements: A sensor wire, which runs parallel to the seat heating in 
the seat cushion, and an evaluation unit. The CIS mat measures the capacity and ohmic resistance 
between the sensor wire (anode) and the vehicle ground (cathode) at a frequency of 120 kHz. The 
CIS mat determines from the change in capacity and resistance whether the front passenger seat is 
occupied by an adult or a child in a child seat. 

The deactivation of the front passenger airbag, the side airbag and knee airbag on the passenger's 
side is signalled by the indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation. 


132 





G05 General Vehicle Electronics 

18. Passive Safety System 

The indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation in the roof function center lights up if a 
child seat with child, for e.g. a child restraint system that has been tested in accordance with the 
NHTSA regulations and is holding a small child, was detected on the front passenger seat or if the 
front passenger seat is unoccupied. 


18.3. System components. 

18.3.1. Advanced Crash Safety Module 

The Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) in the G05 is located centrally in the vehicle under the 
center console between the two front seats. The central sensor system is integrated in the Advanced 
Crash Safety Module (ACSM). 



G05 Crash Safety Module ACSM 


The ACSM 5 of the G05 is a bus user in the FlexRay. The sensor data of the central sensor system 
which was previously provided by Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) can be transmitted directly 
by the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) via FlexRay. 


18.3.2. Sensors and switches 

Lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensor 

The lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensors assist with the identification of head-on crashes, 
side-on crashes and rear-end crashes. 


The airbag sensor consists of a longitudinal acceleration sensor and a lateral acceleration sensor. 
The acceleration sensors measure in X and Y direction the positive and negative acceleration. The 
resultant from the X and Y signals is decisive in identifying the direction of the crash. The airbag 


133 



G05 General Vehicle Electronics 

18. Passive Safety System 

sensors assist with the identification of head-on, side-on and rear-end crashes. The airbag sensors 
on the left and right are of identical design and are allocated by way of mechanical encoding during 
installation. 



G05 Lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensor 


Door airbag sensor (pressure) 

Pressure sensors are installed in the driver's and front passenger doors on the G05. The pressure 
sensors in the doors are now no longer attached with a bolt as was previously the case, but instead are 
screwed into the bracket (inner door panel) and the electrical connections and plug connections can 
only be connected once the relevant sensors have been installed. 

Side crashes are identified with the assistance of the airbag sensors. In addition to the lateral 
acceleration values that are present, the pressure in the door cavity also increases in the event of a 
side-on crash. 

The airbag sensors in the doors are used to verify the plausibility of the acceleration signals from 
the B-pillar airbag sensors and the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) when a side-on crash is 
detected. The airbag sensors are situated in the inner panel of the doors and measure the pressure 
increase in the event of a side-on collision. In the event of a side-on collision at the door the outer skin 
is pushed inwards. The door interior is reduced in size and the inner pressure increases. This pressure 
change is measured by the airbag sensors. The airbag sensor also includes electronics, in addition 
to the pressure sensor, that digitize the pressure readings and transmit them cyclically to the Crash 
Safety Module (ACSM). The data transfer is effected analog to the airbag sensors in the B-pillars. The 
pressure readings are evaluated in the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM).

G05 Door airbag sensor (pressure) 


Airbag front sensor 

Two front sensors are installed in the front area of the engine support in the US version of the vehicles. 
The measured values are forwarded to the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) where they are 
evaluated. 

The airbag front sensors on the left and right assist with the identification of a head-on crash. 

The sensors deliver additional information to the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) on the 
characteristics and severity of the collision. Each sensor contains an acceleration sensor for recording 
the deceleration, signal processing technology and electronics for data transfer. The measured values 
are sent in the form of a message to the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) and are used in the 
calculation of the algorithm.

G05 Airbag front sensor 


Sensors in the ACSM 

In the G05, the central sensor system is integrated in the Crash Safety Module (ACSM). The Crash 
Safety Module (ACSM) contains a longitudinal and lateral acceleration sensor, a vertical acceleration 
sensor and a roll rate sensor for impact detection. The Crash Safety Module (ACSM) also includes a 
longitudinal and lateral acceleration sensor and a yaw sensor for the driving dynamics control. 

The sensor data for impact detection is evaluated in the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) and helps to 
identify side-on, rear-end or head-on crashes and assists with roll-over detection. The sensor data not 
yet evaluated for the driving dynamics control is sent to the DSC control unit via FlexRay where it is 
processed.

Front passenger airbag deactivation 

On the US version of vehicles, the capacitive interior sensing mat (CIS mat) is fitted in the front 
passenger seat. The CIS mat detects whether the front passenger seat is occupied by an adult or a by 
child in a child seat. The deactivation of the front passenger airbag, the side airbag and the knee airbag 
on the passenger's side is signalled by the indicator light for front passenger airbag deactivation. 

Indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation 

In the G05, the indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation is located in the roof function 
center. The indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation in the European and US versions 
of the vehicles is identical. With the European version of the vehicles the indicator lamp for front 
passenger airbag deactivation is activated and lights up yellow if the front passenger airbag and the 
side airbag on the front passenger side have been deactivated by the switch for front passenger 
airbag deactivation. In the US version of the vehicles, the indicator lamp for front passenger airbag 
deactivation is automatically activated if the CIS mat detects a small child in a child seat or if the front 
passenger seat is unoccupied.

Seat-position sensors 

In accordance with the US legal requirement (FMVSS208), a height identification for the person in 
the driver and front passenger seat must be effected. This height identification is effected via the 
adjustment travel of the forward/back seat adjustment. In US-version vehicles, the exact position is 
identified using the seat-position sensors for the driver and front passenger seats. 

The job of the seat-position detector is to distinguish between a relatively small person and a person 
of normal height within the lengthways adjustment range of the seat. This detection is another 
technical feature aimed at increasing the safety of the occupants. The deployment of the two airbag 
stages is then adjusted to the driver's/front passenger's seat position. 


138 






G05 General Vehicle Electronics 

18. Passive Safety System 

The seat-position detector takes the form of a 2-wire hall effect sensor and is supplied with power via 
the Crash Safety Module (ACSM). The current level of the seat-position sensor changes depending on 
the seat position.
