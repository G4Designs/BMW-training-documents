1.4. External CD player 

1.4.1. Introduction 

A CD/DVD drive is not integrated into the new Head Unit High 3. When ordering the vehicle, the 
customer can also order the optional equipment "Preparation for external CD player (SA 65A)". In 
doing so, it is important to bear in mind that this is only the preparation of the vehicle wiring harness 
used to connect the external CD player. The external CD player is available as an optional accessory. 

It is not possible subsequently to retrofit the optional equipment "Preparation for external CD player 
(SA 65A)" to the vehicle. 

When purchasing the optional accessories, the frame and the CD player are installed in the vehicle at 
the workshop. The CD player is automatically detected by the head unit once the vehicle has gone to 
sleep. Coding is therefore also not necessary. 

The external CD player is installed in the glove compartment. 

Audio data read by the CD player is transferred to the head unit via a USB connection or ID3 tags. 

The head unit processes the data and forwards it to the Receiver Audio Module, which has the task of 
playing the music back via the loudspeakers. 

The CD player supports the following file formats, among others: 

• MP3 

• M4A 

• WAV 

• CD-DA 

• FLAC 

• ID3tag. 

DVDs are not detected by the CD player. The external CD player has no diagnostic capability.

When the external CD player is gently pressed from below, a spring mechanism in the latch is triggered 
which causes the CD player to move down mechanically. The CD player must be pushed up to the limit 
position in order to lock the mechanism. During this movement, the spring mechanism is tensioned 
and the latch is locked.

2.3. Smartphone trays 

2 different smartphone trays with NFC electronics are used: 

• Wireless charging and NFC electronics 

• Smartphone tray with NFC electronics. 

Only a smartphone tray with NFC is installed in vehicles without the optional equipment Telephony 
with wireless charging (SA 6NW) but with the optional equipment Comfort Access (SA 322). The 
smartphone cannot be charged in this tray but can be placed there in order to use the BMW Digital 
Key. This kind of tray is easy to identify because there is no indicator light or battery symbol on the tray.

2.4. Screen mirroring 

The screen of a smartphone can be displayed on the Central Information Display by establishing a Wi¬ 
Fi direct connection between the smartphone and Head Unit. 

The sound is played back via the loudspeakers in the vehicle. 



G05 view of screen mirroring 


The Head Unit cannot decide which screen contents are streamed to the vehicle via screen mirroring. 


In the interest of traffic safety, the contents in the CID are switched off when driving at speeds of 
7 km/h or more. 


Screen mirroring can therefore only be used when the vehicle is at a standstill.
