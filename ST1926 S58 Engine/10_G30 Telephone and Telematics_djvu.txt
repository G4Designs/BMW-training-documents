2.1. BMW Connected app 

2.1.1. Introduction 

The BMW Connected app combines all the apps previously provided by BMW into one common app. 
It replaces the following current apps: 

• My BMW Remote app 

• BMW i Remote app 

• BMW Remote App (G12) 

• BMW Connected Classic App (previously: BMW Connected app) 

The BMW Connected app is initially only available for the iPhone®. A version for Android® 
smartphones will follow shortly. 

The previous individual BMW apps will be replaced by the BMW Connected app from October 2016. 


2.1.2. Overview 

The BMW Connected app is illustrated in this product information in conjunction with a BMW i3 so as 
to be able to show more of the app's content. 

Main screen 

One or more vehicles are assigned to the BMW Connected app by way of a registration process. 

A vehicle can be registered either through the ConnectedDrive portal or directly via the BMW 
Connected app. 

The graphic below shows the main screen of the BMW Connected app once a vehicle has been 
assigned.

6AP) and is valid for four years. Once this period has expired, the function can be extended via 
the ConnectedDrive Store for a fee. 

• The vehicle shown in the smartphone is always shown in silver paintwork. 


Further information 

Further information on BMW Remote 3D View can be found in the ST 1604 G30 Driver Assistance

2.2. Wireless connection 

A base plate is no longer provided for any telephone system in the G30. For this reason, the telephone 
is connected to the head unit either wireless or through a USB port. 

A check mark must be set for Apps if these are to be used in the vehicle via Bluetooth when the 
smartphone is coupled in the vehicle.

3. Apple® CarPlay Preparation 

3.2. Prerequisites 

The vehicle and the iPhone® must satisfy certain prerequisites before Apple® CarPlay can be used. 

3.2.1. iPhone® 

The Apple® CarPlay function runs on the iPhone® 5 and more recent models. 

The iPhone operating system must be at least iOS 9.3.3. 

Other Apple® devices (iPad® or iPod®) cannot be connected to the vehicle via Apple® CarPlay. 

3.2.2. Vehicle 

The Apple® CarPlay preparation optional equipment (OE 6CP) is added to the BMW Online and BMW 
Apps standard equipment (OE 6AK) and the standard equipment Professional navigation system (OE 
609). Selected data attributes are swapped between the smartphone and the vehicle when Apple® 
CarPlay is used. 

Further information about Apple® CarPlay may be found in the ST1610 Infotainment 2016 Product 
Information.

4. Telephone Systems 

4.1. Equipment 

The G30 has two different hands-free mode and charging variants for telephones: 

• Convenient telephone with extended smartphone connection (OE 6NS) (standard equipment) 

• Telephone with wireless charging (OE 6NW) (optional equipment) 


4.1.1. Convenient telephone with extended smartphone connection 

No base plate is fitted for the convenient telephone with extended smartphone connection optional 
equipment. With this equipment it is therefore also not possible to charge a mobile phone through a 
snap-in adapter. Nor is connection to the roof-mounted antenna possible any longer with this optional 
equipment. 

Convenient telephone with extended smartphone connection is only offered in countries in which the 
telephone system with wireless charging optional equipment is not available. 

Differences over a hands-free system with USB interface 

The list below shows the convenient telephone with extended smartphone connection: 

• A microphone on the drivers and passenger's side for improved voice quality. 

• Two USB interfaces each with 2.1 A charge current. 

• WiFi Hotspot optional equipment (OE 6WD) can be added. 

• Possible to play videos via USB. 

• Coupling of 2 mobile phones and an audio device simultaneously.

4.1.2. Telephone with wireless charging 

Telephone with wireless charging (OE 6NW) has the same functions as the convenient telephone with 
extended smartphone connection. Additionally, the smartphone can be charged wirelessly and has a 
connection to the roof-mounted antenna. 

Mobile phones must be compatible with wireless charging for this feature to operate. 

Charge station 

The wireless charging station is located in the front of the center console below the IHKA control 
panel. The wireless charging function and the connection to the roof-mounted antenna are identical to 
those for a wireless charging station under the center armrest (G12). If equipped, wireless charging of 
the BMW display key is also possible.
