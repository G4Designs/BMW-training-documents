The FlexRay overview includes all engine versions and optional equipment. The DME (item 2) is 
present for 6-cylinder engines. DME1 (item 7) and DME2 (item 3) are present for 8-cylinder engines. 
The terminating resistors for line termination are located in the DME units and in the Body Domain 
Controller. 

The FlexRay has a data transfer rate of 10 MBit/s. 

1.2.4. Ethernet 

Ethernet with 5 lines or 4 lines 

Ethernet was already used with 5 lines in the F01 for vehicle programming and for the map update of 
the navigation system (4 data lines and 1 line for interface activation). In the F01 there is an additional 
Ethernet connection from the head unit to the Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE) with 4 data lines for 
transmission of the navigation data for the RSE. 

Both Ethernet variants are comparable with the standard Ethernet variant 10OBASE-TX in PC 
networks. The Ethernet version with 5 lines is still used in the G12 from the OBD2 interface to the 
Body Domain Controller. 

Ethernet with 2 lines 

A new Ethernet with two lines is used for communication in the G12. 

This two-wire, twisted and unshielded bus line was developed by the OPEN Alliance BroadR-Reach. 
At BMW, this Ethernet is called OABR Ethernet and has been adapted for the automotive sector. 

The data rate for an OABR Ethernet connection is up to 2 x 100 Mbit/s.

Hardware advantages 

One advantage is the transmission of vehicle camera data. Vehicle cameras (IP-based) are not 
connected to one control unit, but several control units by Ethernet which allows these units to access 
the camera data flow efficiently. The network is therefore very flexible and is well prepared for the 
future. 

Another important advantage is the fast programming of control units. The programming times are 
reduced significantly via Ethernet. Whereas a CAN bus can only transmit data with a maximum length 
of 8 bytes per message, Ethernet messages have a length of over 1500 bytes. The user data rate thus 
increases: Considerably more message packages can be transmitted in a shorter period. 

The OABR Ethernet connection equates to additional weight and cost savings, due to only using 2 
wires. 

Data transfer 

For data transfer in the standard Ethernet 100BASE-TX, one line pair is needed for transmitting data 
and one pair for receiving. 

In contrast to the standard Ethernet described above, with the OABR Ethernet the data is now 
transmitted with one line pair. This means with the 2-wire OABR Ethernet, a simultaneous transmit- 
receive mode is done via each of the two single pair cables. The two lines transmit a sum signal 
differentially. If a line is interrupted, a signal can no longer flow back through the second wire via 
the differential transmission. A symmetrical transmission would thus no longer be possible, the 
communication via the data bus comes to a standstill. 

During the transmission, messages with 100 MBit/s are transmitted simultaneously in both directions 
via the lines. In total, this gives a maximum transmission speed of 200 MBit/s of data. In the transceiver, 
the transmitted message is subtracted from the bus signal. The result is the message of the opposite 
transceiver. A schematic diagram of the transceiver of the OABR Ethernet shows how the data 
exchange takes place:

Layer model 

The message transmission follows the rules which were defined for the conventional Ethernet 
10OBaseTX. The bodies on the transmitter and receiver side must work according to these defined 
rules so that they agree how the data is to be processed. 

With the Ethernet, the Open Systems Interconnection model is used (OSI model). 

It comprises 7 layers: 

• Layer 1: Physical layer with 100 MBit/s 

• Layer 2: Link (device driver, hardware) 

• Layer 3: Network (package delivery, routing) 

• Layer 4: Transport (package security, encryption) 

• Layers 5-7 Applications (user applications and processes) 

For the 2-wire Ethernet OABR, the following modules were also added: 

• Vehicle network management 

• Service discovery report (for the asynchronous starting and stopping of functions)

• 1 relay for rear window heating 

All relays are bi-stable relays. The relays area activated by the Body Domain Controller via LIN. 
The hard-wired terminal 30B relays of the two front power distribution boxes are activated 
via the rear power distribution box. 


3.2.11. Body Domain Controller 

The Body Domain Controller (BDC) is responsible for the terminal control. 

A terminal 30F relay is installed in the BDC. 

A number of consumers are supplied with terminal 30, terminal 30F, and provided with corresponding 
fuse protection via the BDC.

3.2.12. PCU with vehicle electrical system assistance measure 

On vehicles with the equipment Electric Active Roll Stabilization, energy is supplied by the auxiliary 
battery in the engine compartment. 

Modern vehicles have a high energy consumption due to the many electrical consumers. As a result, 
there is a high demand on the battery particularly in phases in which the combustion engine is not 
running and the alternator supplies no energy (e.g. engine start-stop phases). 

In order to protect the battery, a DC/DC converter is installed in the Power Control Unit (PCU) and an 
auxiliary battery is installed in the engine compartment. 

The preconditions for the direction of the energy management are calculated from the use of the 
vehicle. When the engine is running the auxiliary battery is charged from the conventional vehicle 
electrical system. During the phases in which the combustion engine is not running, e.g. automatic 
engine start-stop function, the conventional vehicle electrical system is supplied by the auxiliary 
battery. 

The Power Control Unit (PCU) is connected to the PT-CAN2 and a DC/DC converter with a power 
of 500 W. 


3.2.13. 24 V Electronic Power Steering 

The higher weight 8-cylinder engine in the G12 results in a higher front axle load. This increases the 
effort that is required by the power steering servo. Due to these high currents, it is necessary 
to increase the voltage supply of the EPS to 24 V. 

An auxiliary battery, separating element and a charging unit for the auxiliary battery are required for 
this. These components are installed in the luggage compartment of the G12. 

The charging unit monitors the state of charge and charges the auxiliary battery using a DC/DC 
converter. It monitors a line shield of the 24 V line and various other conditions. The charging unit also 
switches the relay in the separating element, which integrates the auxiliary battery in the circuit. The 
EPS is supplied with 24 V only once this relay has been switched on. The EPS can also be operated 
with 12 V in the event of a fault.

4. Terminal Control 


The terminal control in the G12 is different from other BMW models. The terminals are controlled via 
a customer-oriented condition management. In the G12, based on the customer’s point of view, the 
vehicle is always in the right condition. The terminal control is dependent on the driving conditions. 

4.1. Vehicle conditions 

The G12 vehicle may be in the following conditions: 

• PARKING (asleep) 

• RESIDING (awake) 

• DRIVING (ready) 

The different vehicle functions are possible corresponding to the respective conditions. 

PARKING (asleep) 

• Customer not in the vehicle 

• Vehicle secured or not used for a certain time 

• Vehicle functions cannot be operated 

RESIDING (awake) 

• Customer in the vehicle 

• No driving readiness 

• Functions that are relevant when the vehicle is stationary can be operated 

DRIVING (ready) 

• Customer in the vehicle 

• Driving readiness established 

• All functions are available 

The driving conditions are changed by the condition management taking into account the customer 
behavior. Additional information is also evaluated to help determine the vehicle condition, e.g.: 

• Door opening 

• Door closing 

• Operations in the vehicle

4.2. Power supply terminals 

Control units in the vehicle must be supplied with power only when they are needed. The following 
terminals are used in the G12: 

• Terminal 15N 

• Terminal 30B 

• Terminal 30F 

• Terminal 30 

Terminal 15N supplies control units which are needed only when driving and which may be needed to 
safely end a journey. After-run of 5 s starts at the transition from DRIVING to RESIDING. 

Terminal 30B is used to supply control units that are needed in the stationary mode RESIDING and for 
stationary functions where the customer is not in the vehicle. An after-run starts at the transition from 
RESIDING to PARKING and terminal 30B is then switched off.

4. Terminal Control 


Terminal 30F is used to supply control units which must perform functions in PARKING condition. 
Terminal 30F is normally switched on in PARKING condition, but may be switched off due to faults 
in the vehicle electrical system. The terminal is switched off with an after-running period of 1 min 
if a fault is detected. 

Terminal 30 control units (e.g. alarm system) are always supplied with voltage and are also not 
switched off in the event of a fault.

Testing Analysis Diagnosis (PAD) 

The vehicle condition Testing/Analysis/Diagnosis is still present for diagnosis. All terminals are 
switched on in this mode. This ensures that diagnosis can be performed with all control units. 
This vehicle condition is displayed in the BMW diagnosis system. 


4.3. Partial network operation 

Today's premium vehicles contain up to 70 control units with well over 100 microcontrollers which are 
networked with each other. However, depending on the current vehicle condition or the vehicle user 
requirement, not all convenience and assistance systems need to be energized. 

It is possible to save energy, relieve the load on the battery and also prolong the battery life by targeted 
deactivation and activation on control units which are not needed, so-called selective partial network 
operation. 

If functions are not used or needed when driving, seat adjustment for example, the corresponding 
control units can be switched off. 

In vehicles with combustion engines, the electrical energy consumption is indirectly linked to the fuel 
consumption via the alternator. As a result, selective deactivation of control units that are not currently 
needed can contribute to reducing fuel consumption and thus also CO 2 emissions. 


4.3.1. Prerequisites for partial network operation 

The partial network master in the Body Domain Controller calculates a partial network status on 
the basis of the current vehicle condition and the required functions. The control units that are not 
required are switched off by means of the corresponding bus messages.

4.3.2. Prerequisites of control units for partial network operation 

Different transceivers are used in order to determine partial network operation in control units. These 
transceivers are able to evaluate and interpret messages. A control unit remains switched off as long 
as bus communication takes place without a valid wake-up event for the corresponding control unit. If 
a valid wake-up event for the corresponding control unit is sent on the bus, the transceiver can activate 
the voltage regulator of the microcontroller and the control unit starts up. The control unit is switched 
off by deactivation of the voltage regulator.
