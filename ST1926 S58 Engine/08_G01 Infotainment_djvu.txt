4.4. Phase diversity 

The phase antenna diversity of a Headunit Basic used one of the two tuners to update the list of 
stations. For this short period in which the station list was being updated, only one tuner was available 
for reception of the current station. The phase antenna diversity in the Headunit Basic 2 features a 
revised tuner. 

The revised tuner is responsible for the station list and for TMC messages, depending on the 
equipment. Thus, 2 tuners can now be used permanently for the audio playback.
