1. Introduction 

1.1. Overview 

In February 2017, the 7th generation of the BMW 5 Series G30 will be launched. The G30 contains a 
wealth of new technologies and design elements that have been further developed and refined. The 
closed radiator grill and the precise contours of the hood lend the front of the new BMW 5 Series a 
sporty character. The elegant lines of the side view are emphasized by the distinctive bead and the 
accentuated Hofmeister kink. 

In terms of technology, the new BMW 5 Series is based on the G12. The topics listed below are 
described in the G12 Technical Reference Material “ST1501 G12 Complete Vehicle”.

1.5.2. Underbody 

The almost fully closed vehicle underbody plays an important role in the aerodynamics. The acoustics 
in the vehicle are also significantly improved as a result. In the front section, the air flow is directed 
past the front wheels by the displacers (7). In this way, the airflow on the front wheel is reduced. In the 
rear area, the 2 wind deflectors (3) on the axle and the cover of the rear axle differential (5) contribute 
to optimized underbody flow together with the rear diffuser (4), which is adapted for each drivetrain 
design.

2.2. Body structure 

The lightweight body construction concept of the G30 comprises high-strength steel and Aluminum 
components. There is no Carbon Core used in the construction of the G30 body like in the G12. The 
use of die-cast Aluminum components has increased significantly. Thanks to the material mix, the 
materials are able to contribute their specific strengths to the vehicle in the best possible way. As a 
result of the strict lightweight construction philosophy, the weight of the body has been reduced by 
around 46 kg /101 lbs over the predecessor FI 0, but crash safety has been further improved.

2.2.2. Aluminum 

The use of Aluminum extruded profiles and complex die-cast Aluminum parts accounts for a rigid 
body along with low weight. All requirements relating to passive safety are also met. 

The spring strut domes on the front, and for the first time also on the rear, are manufactured using 
the Aluminum pressure die casting process. As is already familiar from the G12, the side members at 
the rear are now also made as die-cast Aluminum components. This contributes to excellent weight 
distribution in the body structure. New Aluminum cast alloys were also developed in order to increase 
the crash safety of these components.

2.3. Screw connections 

Some of the Aluminum-steel connections in the G30 body structure are produced using a new body 
joining technique: flow drill screws. These include, for example, the connection between the engine 
support (Aluminum extruded profile) and the bulkhead carrier support (ultra-high-strength hot-formed 
steel). 

Flow drill screws are driven directly into the body structure. When this happens, the specially shaped 
tip produces a flow hole and a thread is then cut. This joining technique is used exclusively in 
production.

Once a flow drill screw connection has been loosened, it must not be re-joined using flow drill screws. 
Otherwise this will lead to a considerable reduction in strength. 

In the event of a repair according to Body Repair Level 2 and 3, the flow drill screws are replaced by 
blind rivets.

2.4. Roof support 

The G30 body structure has a hydroformed roof support made of steel. This is welded to the roof 
side frame in line with the B-pillar. By using a hydroformed section it has been possible to reduce the 
vehicle weight along with increasing the stiffness of the body. On vehicles with a slide/tilt sunroof or 
panorama glass roof the reinforcement is incorporated in the relevant roof frame.

3.1. Repair Level 1 

Taking into account the repair stages of the BMW workshop information system, the body repair work 
in the Technical Qualification is divided into 3 repair levels. Each of the 3 Body Repair Levels includes 
certain prerequisites in terms of the qualifications of the employees and the workshop equipment. 

The special characteristics of the add-on body parts and the materials used in the outer body skin are 
described in this chapter. However, the basic functions of the roof and the outer body skin components 
made of plastic are the same as on other current BMW models. For this reason, these components will 
not be described in detail here.

3. Body Repair Level 1 

As was already the case with the F10, the doors, hood and front side panels are made of Aluminum. 
In addition, the trunk and the roof of the G30 is also made of Aluminum, which contributes to the 
significant weight reduction. 

The bumper panels at front and rear as well as the side sills are made of plastic as before. However, 
further development of this material made it possible to reduce the density and weight. 


3.3. Front fenders 

Air Breathers are also used on the front fenders of the G30. The Air Breather is an air outlet behind the 
front wheel, which diverts the air flowing into the rear region of the wheel well in a controlled manner 
towards the fender in order to reduce turbulences in the wheel well area. As a result, the drag and fuel 
consumption of the vehicle is reduced, which in turn means a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

3.4. Trunk 

A trunk made entirely of Aluminum has been used for the first time on the G30. As a result, a weight 
reduction of 4.2 kg / 9.5 lbs was achieved over the FI 0. The multi-part layout of the trunk is achieved 
with the aid of state-of-the-art laser welding techniques.

3.5. Rear light 

On the G30, the rear light assembly is attached with 3 screws to the body. Due to the very small gap 
dimensions to the body, it is necessary to adjust the rear lights to the body. Two adjusting elements 
(figure B) are provided for this purpose; they can be seen when the trunk is open and the trim panel 
has been removed. To adjust the gap dimensions, the adjusting element can be screwed in or out in 
the x direction. The mounting bolt (figure A) serves solely for mounting in the Y direction.

4.1. Overview 


The vehicle interior shows significant further developments in comparison to the FI 0. The all-round 
visibility has been improved. This is further supported by the very flat design of the roof function 
center. In addition, the headliner, which is equipped with sound insulation, helps to make the interior 
cabin noticeably quieter than the FI 0.

4.2. Seats 


4.2.1. Front seats 

As a design element, the seats are an important element of a sporty-luxurious vehicle interior. Special 
stitching accents are provided in the form of decorative stitches for the Dakota leather trim and for the 
Saddle leather trim. The following front seat variants are available for the G30:

On the multifunction seat, 5 touch-sensitive sensors are integrated in the switches for fore-and-aft 
seat adjustment. As a result, when the adjustment switch is touched a pop-up is opened in the Central 
Information Display (CID), which shows the function and adjustment range of the switch that has been 
touched. Further information on this topic can be found in the Technical Reference Material “ST1501 
G12 Complete Vehicle”. 


4.2.2. Massage functions 

A massage programme is offered for the driver and front passenger in conjunction with the 
multifunction seat. Eight different massage functions in the backrest and seat cushion activate or 
relax the muscles, thereby helping to relax the back muscles and relieve the strain on the intervertebral 
discs. Here, the occupants can choose between 3 different intensity levels.

When working on the pneumatic components, it must be ensured that the lines are routed exactly, 
otherwise there is a risk of the lines being kinked. 


Mobilization 

With the mobilization program, it is possible to choose between the pelvis, upper body or full body. 
During the massage, the strain on the spine is relieved by targeted body movements. 

Relaxation 

Three different regions of the body can be selected for the relaxation program. Targeted massage 
helps to relax the back, shoulder or lumbar muscles. 

Vitalization 

The vitalization program is made up of both mobilization and relaxation. The occupant can choose 
between the body areas of upper body and full body. The combination of movement and massage 
ensures optimum relaxation and recuperation particularly on long journeys. 

4.2.3. Seat heating for driver/front passenger 

For the first time on a BMW vehicle it is now possible to pre-set the seat heating. It is possible to select 
between the driver and front passenger and to choose the heating stage. If the ambient temperature 
drops below the pre-set value, set by the driver and the relevant seat belt buckle is latched, then the 
seat heating is automatically activated as soon as the vehicle drives off. The integrated automatic 
heating/air conditioning system (IHKA) main menu is opened via the IHKA menu button. 

First the seat and steering wheel heating needs to be selected.

The luggage compartment capacity of the new BMW 5 Series has been increased by 10 liters in 
comparison to its predecessor, the FI 0, to 530 liters /14 ft * 1 2 3 4 5 . By adding a compact spare wheel as 
optional equipment, the luggage compartment capacity is reduced accordingly. On vehicles with 
the (OE 300) space saver spare wheel, the luggage compartment capacity can be restored by the 
customer back up to the full luggage compartment capacity of 530 liters by taking out the insert with 
the space saver spare wheel. The same removable panel can be used for this purpose.
