The two-joint spring strut front axle in the G01 offers the following advantages: 


• Optimum combination of driving dynamics and driving comfort. 

• Very low unsprung masses due to the use of aluminium swivel bearings and integration of the 
wheel guide joints in the tension struts. 

• Very high rigidity due to the joint support function of the steering gear housing. 

The Dynamic Damper Control is available as optional equipment in addition to the conventional 
dampers.

The five-link rear axle is characterized by precise wheel guidance with outstanding driving dynamics. 
This is particularly noticeable with respect to the following characteristics: 

• Directional stability, target precision 

• Load transfer characteristics 

• Self-steering response 

• Lane changing stability 

• Transient handling characteristics (cornering/straight-ahead driving). 

It has been possible to substantially reduce the conflict between the goals of driving dynamics and 
comfort by implementing the following measures: 

• Double-elastic mounting 

Rubber mount between rear axle support and rear axle differential/body 

• Preload-reduced rear axle mounts 

Lower torsion stress on the rear axle bearings thanks to spring struts positioned wide to the 
outside 

• Large support area for the rear axle support 

• Low unsprung mass thanks to innovative sheet steel wishbone technology in conjunction with 
aluminium forged wishbones and aluminium-wheel carriers. 

The large support for the rear axle support and the preload-reduced axle construction are of great 
significance for the outstanding driving dynamics on the one hand and for acoustic decoupling on the 
other hand. This makes it possible to fit powerful, high-torque engines and to reduce the introduction 
of road noise into the vehicle. 

It has been possible to produce the various wishbones, with the exception of the upper wishbone, 
in a sheet steel design. Sheet steel wishbones offer similar weight advantages to aluminium forged 
wishbones, but are cheaper to produce. They are always used when a simple mounting geometry 
is involved (straight wishbones). The top wishbone has been manufactured as an aluminium forged 
wishbone because of its more complex design. 

A_ 

Replacement of the rubber mounts on sheet steel wishbones as a service operation is not permitted. 
The entire wishbone must be replaced in the event of wear to a rubber mount.

3.4. Bonded brake pads 

Bonded brake pads are used in some cases on the front wheel brakes. It has been possible to enhance 
comfort, as the bonded brake pads are substantially less intrusive with regard to interference noise. 

Vibrations which may arise from movement between the brake pad backing plate and brake piston are 
prevented thanks to the rigid connection of the brake pad to the brake piston.

A 

The bonded connection between the brake piston and brake pad backing plate must not be broken 
with a hammer or screwdriver, but only with a plastic wedge, so as not to damage the brake caliper. 


The surface of the brake piston connected to the bonded brake pad backing plate must be cleaned 
thoroughly before new bonded brake pads are flitted. 

The guides on the side must still be greased to ensure ease of movement of the brake pad in the brake 
caliper slot. 

A 

The bonding surface must never be greased with the brake pad paste. 


After installing the bonded brake pads, the brake pedal must be operated for approximately 1 minute. 
This ensures that a reliable bonded connection is achieved between the brake piston and brake pad 
backing plate. 

The brake pads must be completely renewed if the bonded connection does not hold. Reuse is not 
permitted. 

Refer to the latest valid repair instructions for the exact procedure for working on the brake system. 


3.5. Parking brake 

The parking brake is realized by means of a combined brake caliper on the rear axle, as on the G12/ 
G30. 

The parking brake on the F25 was actuated by a separate EMF control unit. This function has been 
integrated into the DSC control unit on the G01. 

The parking brake has a roller mode in order to permit determination of the brake forces on a brake 
test stand. This mode is detected automatically on the basis of a plausibility check (wheel speed 
comparison).

4.2.1. Warnings 

The warning system for the RDCi tire pressure control has been continually developed and modified 
to meet customer needs during the various development stages. The warning system provides 
information promptly in the event of pressure deviations and thus makes an important contribution to 
avoiding vehicle breakdowns as a result of insufficient tire pressures. 

At present it is possible to distinguish between three warning levels.

4.2.2. Notes for Service 

All three 3 warnings are an indication of dropped tire pressure. The RDCi system is therefore working 
correctly and without faults since it performs its task of monitoring the tire pressures. Electrical vehicle 
diagnosis is not necessary in this case, as no fault memory entry has been stored. 

In the case of warning levels 2 and level 3, the tire and tire valve must be additionally checked for 
tightness and damage. 

A_ 

The manufacturer's information must be observed in the event of any work on the wheels and tires, 
without fail. Failure to observe these requirements can lead to serious accidents. 


4.3. Tire pressures 

Optimum adjustment of tire pressure is necessary for the following reasons: 

• Best possible driving dynamics 

• Maximum utilization of tire service life 

• Reduction of the fuel consumption 

• Optimum operation of various suspension control systems. 

For this, the physical principles should be observed in combination with pressure and temperature. 
The following rule of thumb applies in this case: A change in the tire air temperature of +/- 10° C (+/- 
18° F) corresponds to approximately 0.1 bar (1.4 psi) of tire pressure change. 

The tire pressures specified by the manufacturer apply for summer and winter operation, irrespective 
of the temperature. However, it must be noted that due to the seasonal temperature differences, the 
tire pressures should be checked frequently. 

4.3.1. Cold tire pressure 

If the Tire air temperature is the same as the current ambient temperature, this is referred to as cold 
tire pressure. The tire pressures should only be changed with a cold tire pressure on vehicles without 
the electronic Tire pressures plate. 

4.3.2. Warm tire pressure 

During longer journeys at higher driving speeds the tire warms up due to the friction with the road 
surface and tire creep. The temperature of the tire increases as a result and this is accompanied by an 
increase in tire pressure. 

If there is a significant difference between ambient temperature and tire air temperature this is always 
referred to as warm tire pressure. Avoid changing the tire pressures when the tire is warm on vehicles 
without the electronic tire pressures plate.

4.4. Electronic tire pressures plate 

4.4.1. Technical functional description 

As in the G30, an electronic tire pressure specification is also used in the G01. The adhesive 
tire pressure label is supplemented here by an additional user menu in the Central Information 
Display (CID). 

Tire pressures are changing constantly depending on tire air temperature. A change in the tire air 
temperature of +/- 10° C (+/- 18° F) corresponds to approximately 0.1 bar (1.4 psi) of tire pressure 
change. For this reason, you may see a warning message of insufficient tire pressure if your tires 
have cooled significantly. In many of these cases, however, there is not technical fault, but insufficient 
checking of the tire pressures which should be checked at regular intervals. 

Unlike the tire pressures plate sticker, the electronic tire pressures plate permanently monitors the 
nominal pressures taking into consideration the current temperatures. This means that it determines 
and displays the optimum tire pressure at any temperature. 



GOT Electronic tire pressure information

Explanation 

A 

Electronic tire pressure information in the CID 

C 

Tire pressures information label on B-pillar 


Once you have selected the relevant tire type (summer/winter), the tire size on the rear axle and the 
max. speed rating, the appropriate tire pressures are output to the CID (nominal pressure). Following 
the input and before the teach-in drive, these correspond to the tire pressures on the tire pressures 
label. 

The vehicle must then be driven so it can learn the new wheels. Once the teach-in drive has been 
successfully completed, the current optimum tire pressure taking into consideration the tire air 
temperatures is always displayed. This can differ from the information on the conventional tire 
pressures label because it has taken the tire air temperatures into consideration. Correct tire pressures 
reduce fuel consumption and ensure greater driving safety. 

The tire air temperatures are measured by the four wheel electronics units in the various wheels. 

Since the wheel electronics units do not begin transmitting until driving speed has reached 20 km/ 
h (12 mph), it is not possible to determine this while the vehicle is parked. A substitute value can 


18 







G01 Chassis and Suspension 

4. Wheels / Tires 


be produced using the outside temperature sensor when the vehicle is stationary for wheels that 
have already been taught-in (see the following section “Measurement of tire air temperatures when 
stationary”). 

When new wheels are fitted, for example during a wheel change in the workshop, the nominal pressure 
(cold tire pressure) can generally be adopted. When wheels are changed in the winter, however, the 
great temperature difference between the ambient temperature and the current temperature of 
the tire (difference between workshop temperature and ambient temperature) must be taken into 
consideration. Like with the conventional tire pressure label, the tire pressure should be corrected 
slightly upwards here. A change in the tire air temperature of +/- 10° C corresponds to approximately 
0.1 bar tire of pressure change..

A change in the tire air temperature of +/- 18° F corresponds to approximately 1.4 psi of tire pressure

A _ 

After the wheels have completed their teach-in drive, the nominal pressures can differ from the actual 
values determined and entered in the workshop. The background reason for this is the incorporation 
of the temperatures following a completed teach-in drive. The customer should be informed that 
although the tire pressures have been checked, these can constantly change depending on the 
temperature. However, the tire pressures should be adjusted again at an early opportunity if the 
difference is permanently more than 0.2 bar (2.9 psi).

A distinction must be made when using the electronic tire pressures specification in the following 
three situations: 

• Checking the tire pressures 

• Checking the tire pressures after a wheel change 

• Checking the tire pressures of wheel and tire combinations that have not been saved 

(special sizes). 

The relationships and the special features of operation are described in greater detail below. 

Checking the tire pressures 

The tire pressure to be set on wheels that have already been taught-in can be queried from the setting 
menu as follows:

G01 Adjustment of the tire pressures of already taught-in wheels in the CID 


If the tire pressures of wheels that have already been taught-in are to be checked, it is only necessary 
to call up the tire Pressure Control RDC menu and compare the relevant nominal pressures displayed 
with the actual pressures. It must be noted here that the wheel and tire combinations stored must 
match the wheel sizes actually fitted to the vehicle. The difference displayed must then be corrected 
with the help of a tire inflator. It is not necessary to reset the RDCi tire pressure control as it was on 
previous systems. 


A warning issued by the RDCi tire pressure control always relates to the current nominal pressure. 


A_ 

There is no RDC reset provision for the wheel and tire combinations stored (standard sizes). The RDC 
warnings always relate to the nominal pressure displayed. No nominal pressure is displayed if special 
sizes have been selected. In this case, it is still necessary to carry out a manual RDC reset (see "tire 
Selection: Special Sizes" chapter).

Adjustment of the tire sizes to be set on new wheels in the Central Information Display using the example of the G30 

The procedure for setting a new tire type is only necessary under the following conditions: 

• New wheel set installed 

• Change in Max. speed 

• The wheel and tire combination stored in the Central Information Display (CID) does not 
correspond to the actual combination. 

The nominal pressures displayed after the input and confirmation of a new tire type always relate to 
the cold tire pressure. It is not possible to compare actual and nominal pressures through the Central 
Information Display (CID) as the system assumes that a new set of wheels has been fitted and its 
wheel electronics do not transmit any tire pressures while the vehicle is stationary. 

A warning message may be displayed in the event of incorrect operation of the system. If, for instance, 
a new tire type is selected and confirmed after a long motorway journey although the wheels currently 
fitted have not been swapped, there will be considerable pressure deviations between the nominal 
pressure displayed in the CID (cold tire pressure) and the actual tire pressure on the wheels (warm tire 
pressure) because of the temperature differences. The pressure deviation described can, however, 
only be determined using a tire inflator, as the system does not display any actual pressure on the CID 
after confirmation of the new tire type. There could be a new warning message in the subsequent 
teach-in drive if the tire pressures (warm tire pressure) in the wheels were now to be adjusted to the 
nominal pressure displayed on the CID (cold tire pressure) using the tire inflator. 

The background reason for this is the incorporation of the tire air temperatures transmitted. When 
the vehicle is in motion, the wheel electronics are constantly transmitting logs with the following 
information: 


24 




G01 Chassis and Suspension 

4. Wheels / Tires 


• Identification number ID 

• Battery status 

• Tire pressure 

• Tire air temperature 

During the teach-in drive the system detects a warm tire and calculates a higher tire pressure for 
inflation than the nominal pressure displayed before starting the drive (cold tire pressure). The 
difference between the nominal pressure and the actual pressure can now be seen in the RDCi tire 
pressure control menu. The tire pressure must be adjusted again. 

When new wheels are fitted, for example during a wheel change in the workshop, the temperature 
difference between the ambient temperature and the current temperature of the tire (workshop 
temperature and ambient temperature) must therefore still be taken into account. 

Prompts the Central Information Display (CID) 

Correct responses must be given for the following prompts in the menu to enter new wheel and tire 
combinations. 

The illustrations in the table show a G30 by way of example: 


Central Information Display Description 

New wheels can be selected from the tire Settings menu item. 

Important note: 

The displayed nominal pressure must be set if only the tire 
pressure is adjusted and no new wheels are fitted. Resetting the 
RDCi system (RDCi reset) as required on previous vehicles is not 
necessary. The RDCi warning pressures that are currently valid 
always relate to the nominal pressure displayed in the CID. 




The tire type (summer/winter) and the tire size can be selected 
from the tire Settings menu item. 



Various combinations of tire and wheel are stored in the tire 
Selection menu. Find out the correct size on the rear axle of the 
vehicle concerned and enter it into the Central Information Display 
(CID). 



The Special Approval (different tires) menu item can be used in 
the following situations: 

• when a tire type not listed (special wheel/tire 
combination) is being used 


• if the customer wishes to have a tire pressure other than 
that stored by the system for his tire type. 

When this function is used, the RDCi system has to be reset as 
before (RDCi reset) following a correction of the tire pressures. 


25 








G01 Chassis and Suspension 

4. Wheels / Tires 


Central Information Display 


Description 



Once the appropriate wheel and tire combination has been 
selected, the speed status (Under 100 mph, over 100 mph) must 
be specified. The preset values should not be changed by the 
customer. 



Once the modified tire settings have been confirmed, the system 
loads the new nominal pressures applicable. 



The system then displays the modified tire type and the Max. 
speed status. The new nominal pressures applicable for the front 
and rear axle are also displayed. The old actual pressures stored 
have been deleted. 



When the drive starts > 20 km/h (12 mph), the wheel electronics 
units transmit their logs. In the first teach-in stage the tire 
pressures are merely checked for plausibility and displayed in 
color. 

Green = tire pressure OK. 

Yellow = tire pressure not OK. 



In the second teach-in stage, the various wheel electronics are 
assigned to the particular wheel on which they are fitted. After 
successful assignment of the wheel electronics, the actual values 
can be displayed and compared with the nominal pressure. 

In the event of pressure deviations, it is necessary only to adjust 
the actual pressure to the nominal pressure. It is not necessary to 
reset the RDCi system (RDCi reset). 


A 

The nominal pressures displayed must be observed without fail. Failure to do so may result in tire 
pressure warnings from the RDCi tire pressure control system. 


4.4.4. Tire selection: special sizes 

Special sizes (special approval) which are not listed in the menu must be entered by selecting 
"Other tires".

This function should be used for special sizes only. There is no specification of the tire pressure for 
this selection. Following confirmation of the special sizes and adjustment of the tire pressure, the 
RDCi system is taught the tire pressure set after a successful teach-in drive. This means that the 
warning threshold values are calculated by the RDCi system using the tire pressure currently set. This 
function in this menu is therefore identical to that of previous RDCi systems. The tire pressures must 
always be reset in the special sizes menu after any change (RDCi reset). It is not possible to perform a 
nominal/actual comparison of the various tire pressures (no nominal pressure output). 

In exceptional cases, this function can also be used to accommodate special customer requirements. 
The output of the nominal pressure can be disabled by selecting the special sizes (special approval) if 
a customer does not wish to accept the nominal pressures displayed, even after in-depth advice. This 
makes it possible to teach-in an individual tire pressure for the RDCi system warning threshold values. 


In general, the specified minimum pressures must be observed when teaching-in new tire pressures. 
For example, it is not possible to teach-in tire pressures < 2.0 bar (< 29.0 psi). In this event, a tire 
pressure loss warning will be output during the teach-in time.

Irrespective of whether there is a sudden tire pressure loss or a gradual drop in the tire pressure, the 
driver is informed on the Central Information Display (CID) as soon as the pressure falls below the 
defined warning thresholds. 

The system only ever warns of inadequate tire pressures. There is no warning for excessive tire 
pressure.

In the case of wheel electronics that have already been taught-in, the current tire pressures are 
output through the Central Information Display (CID) even if the vehicle is stationary. However, the 
relevant tire air temperatures are required before the system can display the tire pressures that are 
currently applicable. These are determined and forwarded by the four wheel electronics units at 
regular intervals when the vehicle is in motion. Since the wheel electronics do not transmit while the 
vehicle is stationary, the tire air temperatures can only be retrieved while the vehicle is in motion. 

When the vehicle is at a standstill, the tire air temperature is calculated using a special algorithm 
(calculation model). The information from the outside temperature sensor is required for this. 

Once the calculation is complete, the specified tire pressures are output from the DSC to the CID.

The data log sent last before the vehicle stops is saved with the corresponding tire air temperature. 
At the same time the ambient temperature is determined from the outside temperature sensor and 
saved. The tire air temperature currently valid is then calculated using these two values, taking into 
consideration the time for which the vehicle has been stopped. An algorithm is stored in the DSC for 
this. After no more than 2 hours the tires will have cooled down so much that the tire air temperature 
matches the ambient temperature.

As is already familiar from the G12/G30, the G01 does not have Integrated Chassis Management 
(ICM). Its functions are distributed between the optional equipment system (SAS) and the Dynamic 
Stability Control (DSC). 

It has been possible to further improve the driving dynamics in the G01 by selective use of various 
control functions. This is particularly noticeable in the steering behaviour, traction and vehicle 
stabilization. 

The control units necessary to meet the requirements on driving dynamics are located on the FlexRay 
bus. This allows them to quickly exchange their information with each other and react to events. 

The following actuators are activated as needed: 

• Electronic Power Steering (EPS) 

• DME engine control unit 

• VTG transfer box 

• Dynamic Damper Control 

The tables below provide an overview of the various control functions and their effects on the 
drivability:

movement of the vehicle. 

• DSC

Performance 

Control 

Enhances driving safety and driving dynamics when 
cornering by selective distribution of the drive and brake 
forces to the individual wheels. The tendency of the 
vehicle to oversteer or understeer is reduced by brake 
interventions on individual wheels. At the same time, the 
driving power is passed to the outside wheels which have 
to cover a greater distance. The deceleration caused by 
the brake intervention is furthermore compensated for by 
increasing the engine torque. 

• DSC 

• DME 


5.1. Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

Alongside the Vertical Dynamics Platform VDP control unit, the Dynamic Stability Control DSC 
represents the core element of the driving dynamics control systems used to increase active safety. It 
optimizes driving stability in all driving conditions and also traction when driving off and accelerating. 

Furthermore, it identifies unstable driving conditions such as understeering or oversteering and helps 
maintain the vehicle on a steady course.

5.1.1. Functions 

Modern DSC units have a large number of different functions for supporting the driver in hazardous 
situations and in sporty driving. 


Function 

Description 

ABS 

Antilock Brake System 

Prevents the wheels from locking when braking. 

EBV 

Electronic brake force 
distribution 

Regulates distribution of the brake force to the front and rear 
axles depending on the load status of the vehicle. 

CBC 

Cornering Brake Control 

Regulates brake pressure under braking when cornering. 

Dynamic Brake Control 

Applies maximum brake pressure in the event of panic braking 
and thus shortens the stopping distance. 

ASC 

Automatic Stability Control 

Prevents the drive wheels spinning when driving off by engine 
and brake interventions. 

MSR 

Engine drag torque control 

Prevents the drive wheels locking up because of braking by the 
engine when there is a low coefficient of friction with the road 
surface. 

DSC 

Dynamic Stability Control 

Counteracts understeer or oversteer by targeted, wheel-specific 
braking and engine management interventions. 

DTC 

Dynamic traction control 

Reduces DSC interventions and thus enhances propulsion on 
loose surfaces. 

DBC 

Dynamic Brake Control 

Detects panic braking and supports the driver through immediate 
application of maximum brake pressure. 

ADB 

Automatic differential brake 

Replicates the function of a differential lock. 

If a wheel displays a tendency to spin, this wheel is automatically 
braked so that propulsion can still be achieved via the other 
wheel of the driven axle. 

Trailer stabilization logic 

Detects when the vehicle towing a trailer begins to fishtail and 
stabilizes the outfit through selective brake interventions. The 
vehicle will be deliberately decelerated until it has reached a 
speed which is not critical in respect of the fishtailing. 

Hydraulic brake-servo 
assistance 

Increases the brake pressure applied hydraulically in the event of 
failure of the brake servo or vacuum supply. 


38 













G01 Chassis and Suspension 

5. Driving Stability Control 


Function 

Description 

Dry by applying brake 

Dries the friction surface of the brake disc by cyclically applying 
the brake pads in rain (no braking perceptible). 

Brake standby 

Builds up a moderate brake pressure when the driver takes his 
foot off the accelerator pedal very quickly. This means that the 
braking effect will begin sooner in the event of subsequent panic 
braking. 

Fading Brake Support 

Supports the driver when braking if the brake temperature has 
become very high due to an extreme driving style and the desired 
deceleration can be achieved only by applying a higher brake 
force. 

Drive-off assistant 

Holds the vehicle for approximately 1.5 seconds on uphill 
gradients although the driver has already released the brake. 

This means that the driver can drive off comfortably, without the 
vehicle rolling back down the hill unintentionally. 

Automatic Hold 

Automatically holds the vehicle after it has come to a standstill 
without it being necessary to still press the brake when the drive 
position is selected. The brake is automatically released again on 
subsequent acceleration. There is a button to enable and disable 
the function manually. 

Electric parking brake 

When the parking brake button is pressed the DSC control unit 
controls the two actuators on the rear axle brake caliper. The two 
electric motors in the actuators operate a spindle drive which 
uses the brake pistons to press the brake pads against the brake 
discs with a high preload force. 

Brake pad wear detection 

Monitors the front left and rear right brake pads for wear and 
reports a corresponding service requirement through the KOMBI 
instrument cluster or the Central Information Display (CID). 

RDCi tire pressure control 

Monitors the current tire pressures on all wheels and provides 
information when pressures fall below stored warning threshold 
values by issuing corresponding instructions. 

Hill Descent Control HDC 

Automatically regulates the preset driving speed on steep 
downhill gradients by means of wheel-selective brake 
interventions. If the driver applies the brakes, the HDC distributes 
the brake force to all four wheels in the most effective manner.

Unlike in the G12 and G30, the Electronic Power Steering EPS of the G01 is equipped with a reduction 
gear. This transmits the power of the EPS unit to the steering rod via a second pinion (“dual pinion”). 

The current generation of the electromechanical power steering offers the following advantages: 

• Integrated, driving speed-dependent steering assistance (Servotronic) 

• Improved comfort for steering 

• Lower noise generation 

• Lower wear 


5.2.2. Variable sport steering 

As already in the predecessor, variable sport steering (OE 2VL) is standard on the M40i and optional 
on the xDrive 30i. 

The more direct steering gear ratio when compared to the basic version of the EPS and the resultant 
reduced steering angle achieve more direct vehicle response and higher agility. This comes in handy 
during avoidance manoeuvres for example.

The variable steering gear ratio is implemented through the stroke-dependent gear geometry of

becomes increasingly more direct.

5.3. Dynamic Damper Control 

The optional Dynamic Damper Control (OE 223) is a variable, electronically controlled shock absorber 
adjustment system that controls the vertical dynamics. It improves the tire comfort of the vehicle 
while at the same time increasing the driving dynamics. The driver can choose between the more 
comfortable or more sporty sides of the vehicle's character by means of the drive dynamic control 
switch. 

Like the F25, the G01 is also equipped with vertical acceleration sensors at the front. The 
body movements (pitching, rolling and lifting) are now detected by the Advanced Crash Safety 
Module (ACSM) instead of by the Integrated Chassis Management (ICM). 

For this purpose, an enhanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) High is installed in the G01 in 
combination with the Electronic Damper Control. This detects the body movements by means of 
additional sensors and makes this information available to the Vertical Dynamic Platform (VDP) control 
unit.
