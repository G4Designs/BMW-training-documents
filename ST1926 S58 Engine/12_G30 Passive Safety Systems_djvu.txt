G30 Passive Safety Systems 

1. Introduction 

1.1. The hidden protector 

The passive safety system of the G30 is based on the objectives and characteristics of current BMW 
models. The passive safety system fulfils all legislative requirements worldwide. 

The restraint systems ensure that the risk of injury is reduced. 

The 5th generation Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) is used as the central airbag control unit 
for the passive safety system in the G30. With the passive safety system of the G30, the central sensor 
system is integrated in the ACSM control unit, which is installed in the center of vehicle. 

The ACSM of the G30 is a bus user in the FlexRay. This allows the sensor data of the central sensor 
system to be transferred to the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC).

G30 Passive Safety Systems 

3. Functions 

3.1. Functions of the Advanced Crash Safety Module 

The function of the Advanced Crash Safety Module is to permanently evaluate all sensor signals in 
order to identify a crash situation. Based on the sensor signals and their evaluation, the Advanced 
Crash Safety Module (ACSM) identifies the direction of the crash and the severity of the impact. 

The Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) evaluates the sensor information and then initiates the 
relevant measures for selective activation of the necessary restraint systems. 

At the same time the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) monitors the system itself and indicates 
when it is ready for operation by switching off the airbag indicator light. 

If an error occurs during operation this is stored in a fault memory The fault memory can be read out 
for diagnosis purposes. 

If a crash situation is detected, a crash message is sent to the other bus users in the data bus network 
as notification. The relevant control units respond to this signal by executing their own activities 
according to the severity of the crash. 

The activities include: 

• Opening the central locking system 

• Activating the hazard warning flasher 

• Switching on the interior light 

• Switching off the fuel pump control electronics 

• Making an emergency call 

An additional function of the Advanced Crash Safety Module is the acoustic seat belt warning that 
reminds the driver using visual and acoustic signals to fasten his seat belt. Seat belt buckle switches 
are used to identify whether the driver and the front passenger have their seat belts fastened. On 
motor vehicles in European version, the seat belt buckles in the rear passenger compartment are 
also monitored. In addition, for vehicles, the position of the driver's and the front passenger seat is 
monitored. 

The functions of the Advanced Crash Safety Module generally belong to one of the following areas: 

• Crash-relevant functions 

• System monitoring functions 

• Additional convenience functions 


10 




G30 Passive Safety Systems 

3. Functions 

3.2. Crash-relevant functions 

The Advanced Crash Safety Module must fulfil the following crash-relevant functions: 

• Evaluating the sensor signals 

• Impact detection 

• Determining actuators to be activated 

• Specifying the trigger time and trigger sequence 

• Activation of the ignition circuit output stages 

• Sending the crash message to all bus users 

• Crash documentation 

• Emergency call function 


3.2.1. Evaluating the sensor signals 

The sensors serve to identify and verify front-end, side-on and rear-end crashes and also as roll-over 
detection. 

The sensors are located in the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) or are directly connected to 
the Advanced Crash Safety Module, where their signals are evaluated and processed. 

3.2.2. Impact detection 

The G30 is equipped with the following sensors: 

• One lateral and one longitudinal acceleration sensor in the B-pillars (green) 

• One airbag sensor to monitor the pressure in each of the front doors (blue) 

• One lateral and one longitudinal acceleration sensor in the ACSM (yellow) 

• One roll rate sensor in the ACSM (yellow) 

• One vertical acceleration sensor in the ACSM (yellow) 

• One airbag front sensor each on the engine supports (red) 

The airbag sensors in the doors assist with the identification of a side-on crash. 

The airbag front sensors assist with the identification of a head-on crash and its corresponding 
severity.

3.2.3. Trigger time and trigger sequence 

The Advanced Crash Safety Module uses the values transmitted by the sensors to determine the 
direction and severity of the crash. 

In the event of a head-on crash, for example, the correspondingly high acceleration values from the 
longitudinal acceleration sensors in the rear doors and Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) 
respectively must be detected. An algorithm determines the severity and direction of the crash 
based on the accelerations. This information is used to assist calculation of the activation times and 
sequence in which the restraint systems are activated. 

A possible imminent rollover is also detected and the appropriate protection systems are energized. 

3.2.4. Activation of the ignition circuit output stages 

The Advanced Crash Safety Module is supplied by the power distribution box on the rear right using 
terminal 30B. The Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) is in offline mode with terminal 30B. This 
means that it is active on the data bus and can perform all diagnostic functions. 

Activation of the ignition circuits is blocked and is available as of the "Driving" driving condition once 
the system self-test is complete. 

The ignition capacitors are recharged via a switching controller. These ignition capacitors make the 
firing energy available in the event of a crash. If the voltage supply is interrupted during a crash, the 
ignition capacitors serve briefly as an energy reserve. 

The ignition circuit output stages consist of a high-side and a low-side power switch. The high-side 
power switch connects the ignition voltage, while the low-side power switch connects to the ground. 
The ignition circuit output stages are controlled by a microcontroller. 

The high-side and low-side power switches also serve to check the ignition circuits during the system 
self-test.

3. Functions 


3.2.5. Sending the crash message 

In the event of a collision involving activation of the restraint systems, the Advanced Crash Safety 
Module (ACSM) sends a crash signal to the bus users in the data bus network. 

The Telematic Communication Box 2 (TCB2) is actuated in parallel via a direct single-wire connection. 

The TCB2 serves as a data modem in the vehicle. The emergency GSM antenna is integrated in the 
TCB2. This can be used to establish a telephone connection via the connected vehicle microphone 
even if the vehicle has rolled over. A built-in SIM card inside the control unit makes these emergency 
calls possible. 

As a result, the respective control units perform the following functions depending on the crash 
severity:

3.2.6. Crash documentation 

In the event of a collision where one or more actuators are activated, a crash entry is stored in a non¬ 
erasable memory. After 5 crash entries, a non-erasable fault memory entry is stored together with 
the information that the 5 crash signals have been saved. The airbag indicator light also lights up 
continuously. 

A 

The 5 crash entries are also able to be stored during the course of an accident. Each crash entry 
is assigned a system time. The control unit remains ignitable even after 5 crash entries. The crash 
entries cannot be erased and serve the purpose of subsequent device diagnosis. A maximum of 5 
crash entries can be saved. The control unit must then be replaced.

G30 Passive Safety Systems 

3. Functions 


3.2.7. Emergency call function 

The emergency call functions are country-specific and are available to customers in countries 
with ConnectedDrive Services infrastructure. An emergency call requires an active SIM card in the 
Telematic Communication Box 2 (TCB2) and an available mobile phone network. 

The emergency call button is connected directly with the TCB2. 

The manual emergency call allows the driver to request assistance in the event of a medical 
emergency. 

The next chapters provide detailed information on which functions the G30 receives with the standard 
equipment BMW Assist eCall. 

3.2.8. BMW Assist eCall 

The standard equipment BMW Assist eCall always includes the option of a manual or automatic 
emergency call (voice call and data transmission). A voice contact is initiated and data, such as the 
current position, is transmitted. The emergency call is made to a BMW Call center or an emergency 
coordination center, depending on the national-market version. 

In the event of an accident with corresponding crash severity, the Advanced Crash Safety Module 
(ACSM) sends a message to the TCB2. The TCB2 initiates an emergency call. 

With this automatic emergency call, the presumed number of people in the vehicle and sensor data, 
among other things, are transmitted to the BMW Call center, in order to identify the severity of the 
crash. 

The information about the accident available at the call center can be forwarded to the emergency 
coordination center. The emergency coordination center can then initiate appropriate measures. 

Attempts are made at the same time to establish a voice contact with the occupants of the vehicle in 
order to obtain more detailed verbal information about the accident (e.g. condition of occupants). 

The following tables provides information on which functions are available in the case of an emergency 
call with BMW Assist eCall:

G30 Passive Safety Systems 

3. Functions 

3.3. System monitoring functions 

The Advanced Crash Safety Module has the following system monitoring functions: 

• System self-test (pre-drive check) 

• Display of system operability 

• Cyclic monitoring 

• Fault display and fault storage 

• Output of faults (diagnosis) 

• Acoustic and visual seat belt warning 

• Deactivation of the front passenger airbag and side airbag and 
knee airbag on the passenger's side and the knee airbag 


3.3.1. System self test 

The Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) performs a system self-test after a terminal change has 
been made as of the "DRIVING" driving condition. The airbag indicator light is activated for roughly 5 
seconds during the system self test. 

Once the system self test is complete and no faults have been identified, the airbag indicator light 
goes out and the system is ready to operate. 

3.3.2. Display of system operability 

The airbag indicator light in the instrument panel goes out to indicate that the Advanced Crash Safety 
Module is ready for operation. 

3.3.3. Cyclic monitoring 

Once the system self-test has been successfully concluded and the system is ready for operation, 
a cyclic monitoring procedure is performed for fault monitoring purposes. This cyclical monitoring 
serves the internal diagnosis of the control unit and overall airbag system. Cyclical monitoring takes 
place continuously as of the "RESIDING" driving condition. It is only performed completely after a 
terminal change has been made as of the "DRIVING" driving condition. 

3.3.4. Fault display and fault storage 

The Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) has a non-volatile fault memory. The airbag indicator light 
lights up to indicate a fault entry. 

A 


If the fault memory contains the entry that the restraint system has been activated, this only means the 
ignited restraint system is not available for further activation and not that it malfunctioned during the 
crash. 


15 





G30 Passive Safety Systems 

3. Functions 

3.3.5. Output of faults (diagnosis) 

Using the BMW diagnostic system, the fault memory can be read out via the diagnostic interface. After 
rectifying the faults or after renewing activated components, the fault memory can be cleared with the 
diagnosis command "Clear fault memory". 

3.3.6. Acoustic and visual seat belt warning 

An acoustic and visual seat belt warning is a standard feature of all vehicles equipped with the 
Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM). The Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) records 
whether or not the driver or front passenger have fastened their seat belts. If they have not, an acoustic 
and visual warning is output to remind them to fasten their seatbelts. Both seat belt buckle switches 
are monitored separately. Depending on the national-market version, seat belt buckle switches are 
also installed in the rear passenger compartment and a seat belt warning is issued accordingly for the 
rear seat passengers. 

3.3.7. Deactivating the passenger airbag 

US vehicles 

A seat occupancy mat is used on the front passenger seat for the purpose of occupancy detection and 
classification of occupants in the front passenger seat. A Capacitive Interior Sensing mat (CIS mat) is 
used in the G30. 

The CIS mat is made up of 2 elements: A sensor wire, which runs parallel to the seat heating in 
the seat cushion and an evaluation unit. The CIS mat measures the capacity and ohmic resistance 
between the sensor wire (anode) and the vehicle ground (cathode) at a frequency of 120 kHz. The 
CIS mat determines from the change in capacity and resistance whether the front passenger seat is 
occupied by an adult or a child in a child seat. 

The deactivation of the front passenger airbag, the side airbag and knee airbag on the passenger's 
side is signalled by the indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation. 

The indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation in the roof function center lights up if a 
child seat with child, for e.g. a child restraint system that has been tested in accordance with the 
NHTSA regulations and is holding a small child, was detected on the front passenger seat or if the 
front passenger seat is unoccupied.

3.4. Active protection 

The standard equipment of the G30 already includes the Active Protection safety package. 

The Active Protection safety package comprises the following 3 functionally independent subsystems: 

• PreCrash 

• PostCrash 

• Alertness assistant 

The Active Protection safety package increases the safety of the occupants through preventative 
measures in the event of critical driving situations (PreCrash) and through measures after a crash 
(PostCrash). The attention assist monitors the driving style of the driver during the journey and 
encourages the driver to take breaks if necessary.

3.4.2. PreCrash 

The PreCrash subsystem introduces preventative protective measures for the occupants in known 
critical driving situations which may lead to an accident. 

Identification of critical driving situations 

Critical driving situations are identified with help of the inertial sensor system installed in the vehicle. 
Critical driving situations include: 

• Emergency braking initiated 

• Strong understeer 

• Strong oversteer 

• Rollover of the vehicle 

Imminent collisions are detected with the assistance of the camera-based driver assistance 
systems (KAFAS) stereo camera. On vehicles with the optional equipment active cruise control with 
Stop&Go function (OE 5DF) or Driving Assistant Plus (OE 5AT) the data of the radar sensor system is 
additionally evaluated. For the PreCrash detection, separate threshold values are made available for 
the triggering of the PreCrash functions are made available by the camera-based driver assistance 
systems or the radar system. 

Convenience functions 

• When the seat belt is fastened, the front seat belts are automatically pre-tensioned once when 
driving starts. 


Safety functions 

In detected situations that are critical for driving dynamics (for example, emergency braking, strong 
understeer, skidding) the following individual functions become active as needed: 

• Automatic pre-tensioning of front seat belts 

• Automatic closing of windows up to a gap 

• Positioning the front passenger backrest 

• Closing of the sunroof

G30 Passive Safety Systems 

3. Functions 

3.4.3. PostCrash 

The PostCrash subfunction includes the automatic braking function after an accident, which brakes 
the vehicle to a standstill in certain accident situations without intervention from the driver. The risk of 
another collision can thus be reduced. The driver may oversteer the automatic braking after a crash by 
pressing the brake pedal or accelerator pedal. 

The automatic braking after a crash is activated if a crash with sufficient severity has been identified in 
the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM). The Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) then sends 
a signal to the fuel pump control electronics to switch off the electric fuel pump. The same signal is 
evaluated by the DSC. The DSC then brakes the vehicle to a standstill. 

The DSC generates a maximum setpoint deceleration of 5 m/s 2 for braking. During automatic braking 
the accelerator pedal and brake pedal are monitored. The automatic braking is interrupted if the 
accelerator pedal is pressed or if the brake pedal is pressed for a longer period by the driver. Pressing 
the accelerator pedal only causes the braking process to stop. Acceleration of the vehicle is not 
possible as the fuel pump is switched off. 

Also during automatic braking the ABS prevents the wheels from blocking and the DSC stabilises the 
vehicle. If the DSC is in DSC OFF mode during automatic braking, a forced activation of the DSC is 
carried out. 

Approx. 1.5 seconds after reaching standstill, the brake is automatically released and the vehicle must 
be secured against rolling away. 

If a crash is detected, which leads to activation of the safety battery terminal, then automatic braking 
cannot be activated as the DSC pump is no longer supplied with power. 

Automatic braking is not activated under the following conditions: 

• The DSC has failed before the crash. 

• The ABS has failed before the crash. 

• The brake fluid level is too low. 

If these faults occur during or after the crash, the control is led to the end as these faults are then 
interpreted as consequences of the crash.

4.2.1. Lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensor, B-pillar 

The lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensors assist with the identification of head-on crashes, 
side-on crashes and rear-end crashes. 

The airbag sensor consists of a longitudinal acceleration sensor and a lateral acceleration sensor. 

The acceleration sensors measure the positive and negative acceleration in the X and Y direction. The 
result from the X and Y signals is decisive in identifying the direction of the crash. The airbag sensors 
on the left and right are of identical design and are allocated by way of mechanical encoding during 
installation.

4.2.2. Door airbag sensor (pressure) 

In the G30, pressure sensors are installed in the driver's door and front passenger door. The airbag 
sensor in the doors are no longer secured with a screw as was previously the case. The airbag sensor 
are screwed into the bracket. The electrical attachment elements resp. the plug connections can only 
be connected after installation of the respective sensors. 

Side crashes are identified with the assistance of the airbag sensors. In addition to the lateral 
acceleration values that are present, the pressure in the door cavity also increases in the event of a 
side-on crash. 

The airbag sensors in the doors are used to verify the plausibility of the acceleration signals from 
the B-pillar airbag sensors and the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) when a side-on crash is 
detected. The airbag sensors are situated in the inner panel of the doors and measure the pressure 
increase in the event of a side-on collision. In the event of a side-on collision at the door the outer skin 
is pushed inwards. The door interior is reduced in size and the inner pressure increases. This pressure 
change is measured by the airbag sensors. The airbag sensor also includes electronics, in addition to 
the pressure sensor, that digitise the pressure readings and transmit them cyclically to the Advanced 
Crash Safety Module (ACSM). The data transfer is effected analogue to the airbag sensors in the 13- 
pillars. The pressure readings are evaluated in the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM).

4.2.3. Airbag front sensor 

Two airbag front sensors are installed in the front area of the engine supports. The measured values 
are forwarded to the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) where they are evaluated. 

The airbag front sensors on the left and right assist with the identification of a head-on crash. 

The sensors deliver additional information to the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) on the 
characteristics and severity of the collision. Each sensor contains an acceleration sensor for recording 
the deceleration, signal processing technology and electronics for data transfer. The measured values 
are sent in the form of a message to the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) and are used in the 
calculation of the algorithm.

4.2.4. Sensors in the ACSM 

In the G30, the central sensor system is integrated in the ACSM. The ACSM contains a longitudinal 
and lateral acceleration sensor, a vertical acceleration sensor and a roll rate sensor (with the Dynamic 
Damper Control (OE 223)) for the impact detection. The ACSM also includes a longitudinal and lateral 
acceleration sensor and a yaw sensor for the driving dynamics control. 

The sensor data for impact detection are evaluated in the ACSM and help identify side-on, rear-end or 
head-on crashes and assists with roll-over detection. The sensor data not yet evaluated for the driving 
dynamics control is sent to the DSC via FlexRay where it is processed. 



G30 Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) 


4.2.5. CIS mat 

The capacitive interior sensing mat (CIS mat) is fitted in the front passenger seat. The CIS mat detects 
whether the front passenger seat is occupied by an adult or a by child in a child seat. The deactivation 
of the front passenger airbag, the side airbag and the knee airbag on the passenger's side is signalled 
by the indicator light for front passenger airbag deactivation. 

4.2.6. Seat belt buckle switch 

The seat belt buckle switches are located in the seat belt buckles of the driver and front passenger 
seat. European version vehicles are additionally equipped with seat belt buckle switches on the rear 
seat bench. 

The seat belt buckle switch detects whether the seat belt buckle tongue is in the seat belt buckle. 

The supply of the sensors and the evaluation occurs through the ACSM. As of the driving condition 
RESIDING, the seat belt buckle switch is continuously monitored and used for the visual and acoustic 
seat belt warning and also to determine which restraint systems are to be triggered. The seat belt 
warning is active as of the DRIVING driving condition.

4.2.8. Seat-position sensors 

In accordance with the US legal requirement (FMVSS208), a height identification for the person in 
the driver and front passenger seat must be effected. This height identification is effected via the 
adjustment travel of the forward/back seat adjustment. In US-version vehicles, the exact position is 
identified using the seat-position sensors for the driver and front passenger seats. 

The job of the seat-position detector is to distinguish between a relatively small person and a person 
of normal height within the lengthways adjustment range of the seat. This detection is another 
technical feature aimed at increasing the safety of the occupants. The deployment of the 2 airbag 
stages is then adjusted to the driver's/front passenger's seat position. 

The seat-position detector takes the form of a 2-wire hall effect sensor and is supplied with voltage via 
the ACSM. The current level of the seat-position sensor changes depending on the seat position. 


4.3. Actuators 

4.3.1. Overview 

The following actuators are installed in the G30: 

• Two-stage driver's airbag 

• Two-stage front passenger airbag 

• Knee airbag on front left and right 

• Head airbag on left and right 

• Side airbag on front left and right 

• Reel pretensioner with adaptive force limiter 

• Safety battery terminal 

In addition, the following indicator lights inform the vehicle occupants about the condition of the safety 
systems: 

• Airbag indicator light 

• Seat belt warning light for driver and passenger 

• Seat belt warning light, rear passenger compartment

The purpose of the front passenger airbag is to reduce the risk of accident to the front passenger in 
the event of a front-end crash. The front passenger airbag is located in the dashboard. When the front 
passenger airbag expands, the dashboard tears open at defined points. 

A two-stage gas generator is installed, which can be used to activate the stages at short or long time 
differences, depending on the severity of the crash detected and taking into consideration the seat 
position. 

Furthermore, the front passenger airbag features an active vent valve.

4.3.5. Head airbag 

Head airbags are installed in the G30 to protect the occupants' heads in the event of side collisions. 

The head airbag extends from the A-pillar to the C-pillar and covers the entire area of the side 
windows. It expands between the occupants and side structure. 

System features: 

• Extended covered area across all front and rear side windows 

• Protection of occupants from glass splinters 

• Covered area for different-sized occupants optimized

4.3.6. Side airbag 

As with all current BMW models, the side airbag at the front ignites out of the front seat backrest. 

The side airbags and gas generators are accommodated in a plastic housing, the airbag module. This 
is installed in the front seat backrest and is concealed by the seat cover. 

If activated, the side airbag emerges outwards from the backrest frame and spreads between the side 
structure and occupant.

It is important to ensure that no additional seat covers are fitted as they would greatly impair the 
function of the side airbag, or even immobilize it altogether.

4.3.7. Automatic tensioner with linear mechanical force limiter 


In the event of a front-end or rear-end crash or rollover, the automatic reel blocks the extension of the 
seat belt in order to restrain the occupants. The belt force limiter limits the load exerted by the belt on 
the occupants during the accident and the airbags provide the remaining restraining effect. 

With the linear system, the belt force is limited after the locking pins have been sheared off by the 
twisting motion of a torsion bar spring in the seat belt inertia reel. 

Reel pretensioners with linear mechanical force limiters are installed in the G30 in the front and in the 
rear passenger compartment on the left and right.

4.3.8. Automatic tensioner with adaptive force limiter 

For the driver and front passenger, an automatic reel with adaptive force limitation is installed. With the 
aid of a gas generator, there is a changeover from a high to a low power level during the crash, in order 
to reduce the seat belt restraining forces. 

When optimally harmonised with the airbag, it ensures the kinetic energy acting on the occupants is 
more evenly dissipated for the duration of the crash. Thus lower occupant stress values are achieved.

4.3.9. Active head restraints, front 

The active head restraint is used in the G30 in conjunction with the multifunction seat (OE 456). This 
is a head restraint with a pyrotechnic actuator that optimizes the distance and height of the headrest 
in relation to the head if a rear-end collision of sufficient force occurs. This reduces the load on the 
cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear-end collision. The head restraint is activated early, even prior to 
backwards displacement of the occupant's head. 


36 







G30 Passive Safety Systems 

4. System Components 

The active head restraint reduces the load in the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear-end collision. 
For the vehicle occupants therefore, correct adjustment of the head restraint and the distance of the 
head from the head restraint is of crucial importance. 

In the event of a rear-end collision, the active head restraint reduces the distance between the head 
and the head restraint before the occupants are displaced backwards. This reduces the danger of 
injury to the cervical vertebrae, even if a minor accident occurs.
