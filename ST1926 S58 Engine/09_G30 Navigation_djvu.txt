2.2. Navigation maps 

The customer is given a three-year subscription for navigation map updates for both navigation 
systems (Professional Navigation System (OE 609). Furthermore, automatic updating of the navigation 
maps is available for both navigation systems. The prerequisite for this is a valid BMW ConnectedDrive 
contract (OE 6AK). 

The following table features an overview of the navigation system in the G30:

2.3. Update options 

2.3.1. Overview 

The following options for updating the navigation maps are available: 

♦ Automatic updating 

♦ Updating during service 

♦ Updating by the customer 

2.3.2. Automatic map data updating 

The prerequisite for automatic updating of the navigation maps is a valid ConnectedDrive contract. 
The region for automatic navigation map updating is set in the ConnectedDrive portal. 

2.3.3. Enabling code 

The enabling code for the navigation maps is 128 digits long for the headunit (HU-H2) (20 digits on 
older headunits). The enabling code is therefore no longer entered via the controller, but is provided 
the USB stick together with the navigation maps. 

Further information relating to navigation map updating may be found in the Aftersales Assistance 
Portal ASAP (Sweeping Technologies). 

2.3.4. ConnectedDrive portal 

The customer can download the navigation maps from the ConnectedDrive portal and upload 
them into the vehicle himself. A detailed description of this procedure may be found in the Training 
Reference Manual “ST1610 Infotainment 2016”.

3.1.4. Examples 

Practical examples of ParkNow are described below: 

On-street parking 

The vehicle is parked in a metered on-street parking space (available from 3/17). ParkNow is selected 
in the vehicle and parking is started. It is planned that the ParkNow app will be used to pay for the 
service via “smart” parking meters installed on the street. Parking is ended automatically as soon as 
the vehicle travels at a speed in excess of 35 km/h. The parking fees are billed by cash-less methods 
as mentioned previously. 

See the Parkmobile web site for further information regarding the on street parking transaction. 

See the ParkNow web site for more information regarding the parking service app.

No particular parking space is assigned for a reservation, it merely means that a parking space is kept 
free in the multi-storey car park. Recognition and parking for a reserved parking space are identical to 
the procedure described above.

3.2. Parking information 


Parking information is a new function in navigation. The parking information is called “On-Street 
Parking Information” in the vehicle menu. 


A probability of there being free parking spaces determined by calculating various values is shown 
on the navigation map. The data for this calculation is determined by Floating Car Data, among other 
parameters. 


The vehicle must satisfy the following prerequisites which are standard on all G30 vehicles: 


Professional Navigation System (OE 609) 
Advanced Real time traffic information (OE 6AM) 
ConnectedDrive services (OE 6AK) 


The scale for the navigation map must not be set to more than 500 m to allow an overview of the 
parking information to be displayed in the navigation map. The parking information is displayed for a 
radius of 2 km around the current position of the vehicle.

Time information concerning parking spaces freed up by DriveNow vehicles 


A “P” in the map display indicates when a DriveNow vehicle leaves a parking space free. The circle 
around the “P” runs down, like a stopwatch. This lets you see how long ago the DriveNow vehicle left 
the space. A complete revolution of the circle takes 5 minutes. 


3.2.3. Cover 

Parking information is a ConnectedDrive service and is available in selected cities. You can call up a 
list showing these from the menu. At the start, parking information relates principally to a few major 
cities in Germany. The list can change at any time as this is a ConnectedDrive service. That means that 
further cities will follow.
