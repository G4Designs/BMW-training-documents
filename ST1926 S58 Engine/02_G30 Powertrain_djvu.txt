General information 


Symbols used 

The following symbol is used in this document to facilitate better comprehension or to draw attention 
to very important information: 

A 

Contains important safety information and information that needs to be observed strictly in order to 
guarantee the smooth operation of the system. 


Information status and national-market versions 

BMW Group vehicles meet the requirements of the highest safety and quality standards. Changes 
in requirements for environmental protection, customer benefits and design render necessary 
continuous development of systems and components. Consequently, there may be discrepancies 
between the contents of this document and the vehicles available in the training course. 

This document basically relates to the European version of left hand drive vehicles. Some operating 
elements or components are arranged differently in right-hand drive vehicles than shown in the 
graphics in this document. Further differences may arise as the result of the equipment specification in 
specific markets or countries. 

Additional sources of information 

Further information on the individual topics can be found in the following:

1.2. Overview of system descriptions 

Many of the systems used are already known from the current BMW 7 Series G12. The “Comparison 
of G12 with G30” chapter lists the common elements and the differences. The explanations of the 
systems already familiar from the G12 are kept brief. The system descriptions can be reviewed from 
the various technical reference manual’s listed below.

2.1. Models 

With the exception of the 8-cylinder gasoline engine (N63TU2), which has had an engineering 
upgrade, the newly-developed modular engines are used. All engines meet the ULEVII or SULEV 
regulations for the US. 

• ULEV II = Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle 

• SULEV = Super Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle

3.6. Air intake and exhaust emission systems 

3.6.1. Air intake duct 

In contrast to the 4- and 6-cylinder gasoline engines, the 8-cylinder gasoline engine has a two-branch 
intake system. This ensures that the necessary air volume is made available to the engine in every load 
range.

Resonator 

The pulsating gas exchange noise of the reciprocating engine is damped in the air intake duct. 
Helmholtz resonators are technical solutions for achieving the maximum air duct cross-section and 
minimum packaging space volume vehicle-specific damping specifications.

3.6.2. Hot film air mass meter 

The intake air mass is filtered in all engines via an 8th generation hot film air mass meter. 

The hot film air mass meter has the following four electrical connections: 

• Voltage supply (+) 

• Ground (-) 

• Sensor signal (SENT data protocol) 

• Not assigned 

A manipulation-proof SENT signal is available for data transfer.

4. Cooling 

4.1. Active air flap control 

It was possible to carry over the active air-flap control from the G12. The cooling surfaces at the front 
of the vehicle can be closed by means of two separate air flaps. This reduces the drag coefficient and 
thus saves fuel. A further advantage is faster heating up of the engine after a cold start.

The B46/B58 engines have two separate coolant circuits. The coolant in the low-temperature coolant 
circuit to cool the charge air. The coolant in the high-temperature coolant circuit to cool the engine. 
The two coolant circuits each have their own expansion tank.

6. Engine Electrical System 

6.1. Engine control unit 

The new 8th generation of Bosch engine control units already used in the G12 is used in the G30. 

Its appearance is characterized by a uniform housing and a uniform connector strip. However, the 
hardware inside has been adapted to the various applications. 

Two engine control units are used for the N63TU2 engine. All other drive variants are equipped with 
one engine control unit. The integrated supply module is also on the engine control unit. It supplies the 
engine control units and various sensors and actuators with the required voltage supply.

7. Automatic Transmission 


The revised 8HPTU automatic transmission, which is already known from the F23 (2 Series BMW 
convertible) and F85/F86 (BMW X5 M, BMW X6 M) and G12 is used in the G30. 

The special features of the automatic transmission in the G30 are described in this document.

7.2. Highlights 

The following further developments made it possible to increase the comfort, dynamics and efficiency 
of the revamped 8-speed automatic gearbox: 

• Improved driving comfort through hot-end decoupling of the rotational 
imbalance of the engine by means of a centrifugal pendulum. 

• Improved shifting comfort through slightly increased gear steps 
(2 modified planetary gear sets). 

• Increased efficiency through optimum gear spread and gear stepping. 

• Reduction of vehicle-specific insulation measures due to acoustic 
encapsulation on the transmission. 

• Functional enhancements in the area of ConnectedShift. 

• Enhanced customer experience due to new operating possibilities 
with the driving experience switch or shift paddles.

7.4. Sport automatic transmission 

In the standard Steptronic Sport automatic transmission, the customer additionally receives 2 shift 
paddles on the steering wheel and additional functions such as: 

• Launch Control 

• Manual activation of coasting 

• Driving into the speed limiter 


7.5. ConnectedShift 

ConnectedShift uses the following systems for a predictive shift strategy: 

• Use of the navigation data 

• Use of the radar sensors 

Use of the navigation data is already known from the 5 Series LCI. Since the introduction of the G12, 
the radar sensors have been used for an anticipatory gear shift strategy.

7.6.1. Stepped Sport shift mode 

This graduated sport shift mode is already known from the G12 and is offered with the same 
functionality in the G30. 

7.6.2. Influence of the driving experience switch 

Many drive variants have a SPORT PLUS mode in order to support sporty driving with more powerful 
engines. The shift characteristics are adapted as follows in the SPORT PLUS mode: 

• Sharper design of downshifts on braking. 

• Further increase of the engine speed in the direction of maximum power.

7.7. Transmission emergency release 

In the event of a breakdown, emergency release of the automatic transmission is possible in 2 different 
ways. 

1 Mechanical transmission emergency release. 

2 Electronic transmission emergency release.

7.8. Towing 





Index 

Explanation 

A 

Towing on both vehicle axles 

B 

Towing on the rear vehicle axle 

C 

Recovery on a transport deck 


Towing of the automatic transmission on the driven vehicle axle is not permitted. Limited time- and 
speed-dependent towing would not technically damage the automatic transmission, but permanent 
release of the parking lock cannot be guaranteed due to the changed mechanical and electronic 
transmission emergency release. Sudden engagement of the parking lock during a towing operation 
on the driven vehicle axle can lead to damage to the vehicle and to serious accidents.

The designation of the transfer box is ATC13-1. The ATC13-1 is a standard transfer box and was first 
used in the G12. 


One special feature of this transfer box is the Efficiency Mode introduced in the G12, which leads to 
a reduction of the splash losses and to reduce fuel savings. It was possible to adopt the measures 
introduced in G12 for the G30.

8.1. Oil change on the transfer box 

The oil filling of the transfer box is designed for the entire unit service life. This corresponds to 
a mileage of approximately 150,000 km / 92,000 miles. A fault code entry with an oil change 
recommendation for the transfer box is stored when this mileage is exceeded. 



Suction hose with hand pump 
Part number 83 30 0 493 337 

The transfer box does not have an oil drain plug. The oil filling to be renewed must be drawn off using a 
hand pump via the opening of the oil filler plug.

In order to ensure that the entire oil filling has been exchanged, the oil sump must remain open for the 
duration of extraction and filling. 

A 

The Service employee can move the oil sump to the open position by means of the “Service function > 
Transfer box VTG > Oil change” in the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 


Refer to the currently valid repair instructions for the exact procedure.
