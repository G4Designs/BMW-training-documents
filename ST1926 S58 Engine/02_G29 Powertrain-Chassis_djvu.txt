2.5. Cooling 

The B46TU engine in the upper power level, as well as the B58TU engine, have 2 separate coolant 
circuits. 

The low-temperature coolant circuit serves for cooling the charge air (indirect charge air cooling) and 
the high-temperature coolant circuit serves for cooling the engine. The two coolant circuits each have 
their own expansion tank. 

2.5.1. B46TU Engine 

The B46TU engine is equipped with an additional coolant shutoff valve. During the engine's warm¬ 
up phase it blocks the high-temperature coolant circuit to the expansion tank. As a result, the 
engine reaches the operating temperature quicker, thus contributing to a reduction in C02 pollutant 
emissions. The shutoff value is opened without current.

2.5.3. Antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor 

The cooling system of the G29 is filled with the new antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor Frostox® 

HT-12. The new antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor increases the long-term stability and corrosion 
protection of the components. 

It replaces the well-known antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor Glysantin G48. The two can be 
distinguished by their color. The G48 can be recognized by the blue color. 

The HT-12 comes in green and magenta. For the initial filling at the factory the green BMW 
antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor HT-12 is used. For service in the Retailer Organization the HT-12 in 
magenta is used for the time being up to 11/2018. The supply of the Retailer Organization with HT-12 
in green is available as of 11/2018.

Since the beginning of July/August 2018 all cooling systems in new vehicle models (depending on the 
production date and production plant) are supplied with the antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor HT-12. 

Like the G48, the HT-12 contains silicate and forms a silicate layer on metallic component surfaces. 

The silicate-free antifreeze and corrosion inhibitors (G30, i3 coolant), which are used in the cooling 
systems of the BMW i3, are the exception. Here organic salts are solely responsible for the corrosion 
protection. The coolant of the i3 (i3 coolant) can be recognized by the blue color. 

A 

Antifreeze and corrosion inhibitors cannot be mixed with each other in any manner. In the case 
of unauthorized mixing, the antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor may turn into a gel or cause engine 
damage.

The selection of the correct antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor is only possible using the BMW part 
number. In the event of an incorrect selection of the antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor there is a risk of 
component damage or failure. 


2.5.4. Active air flap control 

In the G29 a 2nd generation active air-flap control (used in FI 5, FI 6, F4x and F39) is used. It differs 
from the 3rd generation (used in G3x, G11, G01, G2x, G05 and G15) to the extent that it is not in the 
immediate field of view in the upper cooling air inlet.

However, the function and control match that of the 3rd generation: 

• 2 separate actuators for upper and lower air flaps. 

• Basic logic of operating strategy: First open the lower air flap, then the upper air flap. 

• Air flaps can move to several intermediate settings. 

• Brake air duct is operated or supplied via the lower flap system.

In the predecessor model E89 a 1 st generation air flap control was used. This has an actuator for the 
upper air flap. A lower air flap is only used when a naturally aspirated engine is used. The lower air flap, 
if present, is passive, i.e. without actuator. Like the 2nd generation, the 1st generation is also not fitted 
in the immediate field of view.

3. Automatic Transmission 


The following further developments made it possible to increase the comfort, dynamics and efficiency 
of the revamped 8-speed automatic transmission in the G29: 

• Higher steering axis inclination of the automatic transmission due to larger gear steps. 

• Improved dynamic gearshifts thanks to new development of the mechatronics and the 
electronic transmission control EGS. 

• Improved ride comfort through hot-end decoupling of the rotational imbalance of the engine 
by means of a further developed centrifugal pendulum. 

• Reduction of vehicle-specific insulation measures with an acoustic cover (SynTAK) at the 
transmission. 

• Enhanced customer experience due to new operating possibilities with the driving experience 
switch or shift paddles. 


3.1.2. Designation 

The designation for the 8HPTU2 automatic transmission has been changed. The designation for the 


8HP and the 8HPTU remains the same. The following table provides an overview of the composition of

3.1.3. Sport automatic transmission 

In each model of the G29 a Steptronic Sport transmission (SA 2TB) is used as standard. The customer 
has 2 shift paddles on the steering wheel and additional functions such as: 

• Launch Control 

• Manual activation of coasting 

• Driving into the speed limiter. 


19 







G29 Powertrain/Chassis 

3. Automatic Transmission 

3.1.4. ConnectedShift 

Use of the navigation data 

ConnectedShift uses the navigation data for a forward-thinking shift strategy of the automatic 
transmission. If, for example, a sharp bend is detected, the automatic transmission shifts down early 
and the gear is retained in the bend. 

The route guidance of the navigation system does not need to be activated for the function. However, 
the detection of a turn request leads to more precise control of the system. Up-to-date navigation map 
data also influences the control accuracy. 

Use of the radar 

A prerequisite for use of this function is the optional equipment "Active cruise control with Stop&Go 
function" (SA5DF). 

If the vehicle detects rapid approach to an obstacle via the front radar, the electronic transmission 
control EGS automatically shifts down to a lower gear. 

This means that in a situation where the driver does not want to overtake, the higher engine braking 
torque is used and the driving speed is reduced. In addition, for an imminent overtaking manoeuvre 
there is increased tensile force reserve available for possible overtaking. 

3.1.5. Configuration options 

Influence of the driving experience switch 

Many drive variants have a SPORT PLUS mode in order to support sporty driving with more powerful 
engines. The shift characteristics are adapted as follows in the SPORT PLUS mode: 

• Sharper design of downshifts on braking 

• Further increase of the engine speed in the direction of maximum power. 


3.1.6. Extension of the coasting function 

During coasting in certain conditions the engine is disconnected from the transmission in drive 
position D. The kinetic energy of the vehicle is used and the vehicle continues to roll at idle speed with 
reduced consumption. 

Up to now the coasting function was only available in "ECO PRO" mode and can now also be used in 
the G29 in "COMFORT" mode. 

With "ECO PRO" mode there is an attempt to achieve maximum efficiency/fuel economy. For this 
navigation data is considered in the decision whether coasting is currently useful from an efficiency 
perspective (proactive driving assistant). 

Coasting in "COMFORT" mode is currently not used with the following equipment specifications: 

• BMW M Performance Automobile 


20 



G29 Powertrain/Chassis 

3. Automatic Transmission 


The extended operating strategy guarantees that the coasting function is only activated when 
the driving situation permits an energy-related advantage to the coasting overrun. Apart from the 
navigation data (proactive driving assistant), the accelerator pedal position and the situation in front 
of the vehicle are also evaluated by means of radar (leading vehicle detection). The leading vehicle 
detection analyses the distance and the differential speed to the leading vehicle and decides whether 
coasting is useful in terms of comfort. 

With the accelerator pedal position the customer also has the option to specifically activate coasting 
mode. 


• When the accelerator pedal is released slowly, coasting can be manually activated. 

• There is no activation with a dynamic driving style and rapid change of the accelerator pedal 
position. 

With the new 8HPTU2 automatic transmissions the comfort when deactivating the coasting function 
was enhanced. As a result, a simultaneous downshift upon deactivation of the coasting function is 
possible. 


3.2. Rear axle final drive 

For the G29 two rear axle differentials are available depending on the model and equipment: 

• 190AL 

• 215LWS 


In the sDrive30i the rear axle differential 190AL is used.

• Optimal traction 

• Greater driving stability 

The following table provides an overview of the driving situations in which the regulated rear axle 
differential lock is active: 


Driving situation 

Regulated rear axle differential lock action 

Pullaway 

Generation of lock-up torque. 

Road with different 
coefficient of friction on 
right and left 

In the case of an emerging difference in speed at the rear axle, the 
drive torque is transmitted to the wheel that can transmit more 
driving power. 

Accelerated cornering 

The drive torque is transmitted to the outer cornering wheel via the 
wheel slip of the inner cornering wheel. 

Load reversal upon 
cornering or lane change 

A stabilizing torque is generated from the yaw-rate signal if 
oversteering is detected. 

Oversteering 

In the case of deliberate oversteering the lock is closed from the 
yaw-rate signal and the signal of the accelerator pedal position.

The lock-up torque is generated by a multidisc clutch. The necessary axial pressure is applied to 
the multidisc clutch by the electric motor by means of gears and a ball ramp mechanism. The clutch 
package operates between the expansion tank housing (steel outer discs) and the right output (steel 
inner discs with carbon friction lining).

The central control unit for the calculation of all driving dynamic functions is the Dynamic Stability 
Control (DSC). It evaluates the driving dynamic parameters provided by other sensors and control units 
and forwards the calculated lock-up torque to be adjusted to the control unit for the regulated rear axle 
differential lock (GHAS). This value is transferred on the FlexRay bus to the GHAS control unit. 

The GHAS control unit calculates an angle to be adjusted at the ball ramp from the requested lock-up 
torque of the DSC control unit. The adjusting torque required for control is generated by an electric 
motor. The electric motor is activated directly by the power electronics of the GHAS control unit with 
vehicle voltage via a pulse-width-modulated signal. To determine the position and the direction of 
rotation of the direct current motor it is equipped with 2 hall effect sensors. 

The DSC control unit can also request separate and higher-level locking interventions to stabilize the 
vehicle both when the DSC control system is activated and deactivated. 

Adaptation of multidisc clutch 

A calibration is carried out regularly in order to compensate for wear of the clutch. During this 
calibration a predefined position profile is shut down and by means of the current course of the 
servomotor the adaptation point (clutch slipping point) of the multidisc clutch is determined. This 
clutch slipping point adaptation is repeated every time the combustion engine is switched off and 
compensates the wear during the journey. The clutch slipping point corresponds to the clutch 
position, at which no torque is transferred by the multidisc clutch, which equals a lock-up torque of 
0 Nm.

3.3.4. Note for Service 

Oil change 


The oil filling of the rear axle differential lock is designed for the entire service life of the assembly. 

A 


Vehicles with regulated rear axle differential lock are not designed for use on racing tracks. In the case 
of use on racing tracks very high temperatures may arise in the rear axle differential which may lead to 
premature wear of the rear axle differential oil. In the case of a customer complaint "Noises from the 

rear axle differential", 

an oil change may be useful before an entire component is replaced. 


Classification 

Due to the component tolerances of the different components of the regulated rear axle differential 
lock, the stroke of the ball ramp for closing the multidisc clutch may differ in each case. However, these 
tolerances can be compensated by adapted control of the electric motor for closing the multidisc 
clutch. 

The respective tolerance or the classification code is determined during production and shown on 
a type plate of the regulated rear axle differential lock. This type plate is located on the top of the 
regulated rear axle differential lock.

The tolerance can be determined as follows in Service: 


• Read out of the classification code via the ISTA diagnosis system. 

• Read the classification code off the type plate of the rear axle differential (rear axle differential 
needs to be lowered). 

The 16-digit classification code can be entered in the control unit for the regulated rear axle differential 
lock (GHAS) using the service function "Correction value of characteristic curve" in the ISTA diagnosis 
system. 


30 

















G29 Powertrain/Chassis 

3. Automatic Transmission 


After the following servicing work has been carried out, the classification code must be 
manually entered in the GHAS control unit: 

• Rear axle differential was renewed. 

• If the data of the old GHAS control unit can no longer be read out when renewing the GHAS 
control unit. 

• For fault elimination, if invalid or missing correction values were identified in the control unit. 


A_ 

Only the data printed on the type plate can be entered. Incorrectly entered data lead to a decline of the 
traction or increased wear. 


Service functions 

Three service functions are currently available for the regulated rear axle differential lock: 

• Delete wear data: This service function must be carried out after the renewal of the electric 
motor or the entire rear axle differential. 

• Renew GHAS control unit: This service function must be carried out after the renewal of 
the GHAS control unit. This service function is also performed automatically as a post¬ 
programming follow-up operation. 

• Correction values of characteristic curve: This service function must be carried out after the 
renewal of the rear axle differential or if the individual data recovery for the GHAS control unit 
failed. In the second case the rear axle differential must be lowered.

4. Chassis and Suspension 

4.1. Overview 

The chassis and suspension of the G29 were improved compared to its predecessor, the E89, in terms 
of dynamics while the comfort remains the same. The body structure was geared for rigidity with 
maximum driving dynamics and stability. An axle layout (50:50) specific to sports cars increases both 
the driving dynamics and the optional driving dynamics system Electronic Damper Control (EDC). 

In the basic version and in the M sports suspension the driving dynamics and the ride comfort were 
further improved by equipping the shock absorbers at the front with a hydraulic rebound stop (HRS).

4.1.3. Chassis and suspension packages 

The following chassis and suspension packages are offered in the G29: 

* Basic chassis and suspension 

The G29 is equipped with steel springs at the front and rear axles. The damping action is 
effected as standard with conventional shock absorbers. The front shock absorbers are 
equipped with Hydraulic Rebound Stops (HRS). The springs/dampers on the rear axle are in 
separate locations. 

* Sports suspension (SA 704) 

The sports suspension available as optional equipment on the sDrive30i and features a tauter 
spring/damper design. In this design, the chassis has been lowered by 10 mm. 

* Adaptive M sports suspension (SA 2VF optional for sDrive30i, standard M40i) 

The Electronic Damper Control (EDC) comes with the optional equipment "M sports 
suspension". Four continuously adjustable shock absorbers with coupled rebound/ 
compression stage adjustment produce damping forces according to requirements. The 
shock absorbers can automatically assume a harder setting (more dynamic/sporty) or softer 
(more comfortable) setting, depending on the driving manoeuvre. 

For more information on the EDC refer to the chapter "Electronic Damper Control (EDC)". 

The following table shows the different equipment specifications and scopes in the area of the chassis 
and suspension for the G29:

The elastokinematics was optimized at the front axle in terms of steering precision and lateral force 
potential. This was achieved with the use of an aluminum front axle support designed specifically for 
the G29, an independent kinematics design and corresponding design of wishbone and tension strut 
rubber mount.

4.4.2. Hydraulic Rebound Stop (HRS) 

In order to further improve the driving dynamics and ride comfort, the shock absorbers in the basic 
version and the M sports suspension were further developed. This could be realized with the use of a 
Hydraulic Rebound Stop (HRS) in the shock absorbers at the front. 


40 













G29 Powertrain/Chassis 

4. Chassis and Suspension 


With a rebound stop the range of travel of a shock absorber is limited in order to make possible a soft 
touch of the bumper at the end stop, also with a high load, in the case of unusually sharp bumps in 
road (e.g. driving through a pothole, driving over a curb, sharp bumps). 

This not only protects the neighboring components, but also reduces the noises arising from these 
driving situations.

Bottom valve (rebound and compression stage) 


The front shock absorbers of the E89 were equipped with a mechanical rebound stop. Spring stops 
have a disadvantage, however, as they only have limited damping capacity. The introduced energy is 
emitted back to the body when the stop is relieved, which may lead to undesired pitch motions. 

In order to further increase the ride comfort of the G29, the front shock absorbers were equipped with 
a Hydraulic Rebound Stop (HRS) instead of a mechanical rebound stop. 

With a small wheel stroke, in normal driving, only the working piston with piston valves (8) and bottom 
valve (12) have an effect. 

If, however, a defined outgoing movement is exceeded (approx. 17 mm), a control ring (8) also 
positioned on the piston rod drives into a ring-shaped sleeve (7), which is integrated in the working 
cylinder. The compressed oil volume is driven out of the working space via corresponding throttle 
cross-sections integrated in the control ring (8) and the outgoing movement is dampened in the stop 
area. In order to achieve a soft insert of the hydraulic rebound stop, the sleeve was shaped so that 
its diameter continuously narrows path-dependent. As a result, a progressively increasing force is 
generated in the rebound direction.

This leads to better slowdown of the wheel, i.e. annoying oscillations are dampened, and a faster 
restoration of the damper function is achieved. In addition, the end stop forces could be reduced with 
the hydraulic rebound stop, which means the neighboring components are subject to less load (no 
force peaks).

head of the linkage of the brake servo into a plastic clip at the pedal mechanism. In the E89 this was 
achieved with a fork head connection.

4.5.4. Parking brake 

The electromechanical holding brake in the G29 differs to the predecessor E89 in that a separate 
control unit for the actuation of the electromechanical holding brake could be dispensed with. The 
actuation in the G29 is effected via the Dynamic Stability Control DSC. In the E89 the actuation of 
the electromechanical holding brake is effected via the control unit for the electromechanical parking 
brake EMF.

Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 


At the center console switch cluster there is a parking brake button for activating or deactivating 
the electromechanical holding brake. The driver is informed about the current system status via the 
parking brake indicator light in the instrument cluster KOMBI. 

Dynamic emergency braking 

If the parking brake button is operated during the journey above a defined driving speed, the DSC unit 
initiates a dynamic emergency braking operation. This means the pump and the changeover valves in 
the DSC unit are activated and a pressure build-up occurs in all 4 wheel brakes. The slip limits of all 
wheels are monitored with the assistance of the wheel speed sensors to ensure stable deceleration 
until the vehicle comes to a standstill. 

The two actuators of the electromechanical holding brake are activated as soon as the vehicle comes 
to a standstill and the vehicle is secured against rolling away. 

Automatic release of the parking brake 

This function allows the driver to drive off when the electromechanical holding brake is activated 
without operating the parking brake button to release the brake.

G29 Powertrain/Chassis 

4. Chassis and Suspension 

Prerequisites for releasing the electromechanical holding brake: 

• Driver's door is closed 

• Vehicle condition DRIVING 

• Activated electromechanical holding brake 

• Drive position engaged 

• Accelerator pedal operated 


Brake test stand 

Test stand mode is integrated in the Dynamic Stability Control DSC for checking the braking power of 
the parking brake on a brake test stand. With the activation of test stand mode the electromechanical 
holding brake is activated via the parking brake button and the brake forces are determined. 

Test stand mode is automatically detected by means of a plausibility check (wheel speed comparison). 
The detection takes a maximum of 5 seconds (can be recognized by flashing of the red parking brake 
indicator light in the KOMBI). 

After activation of test stand mode the system is in test stand mode. This condition is acknowledged 
by the indicator light of the parking brake starting to flash at a frequency of 1 Hz. 

The electromechanical holding brake can be applied in up to 5 stages using the parking brake button. 
The flashing frequency of the parking brake indicator light changes from 1 Hz to 3 Hz when the parking 
brake button is pressed in test stand mode. 

If the parking brake button is operated continuously, the system automatically increases the braking 
power in increments up to the maximum braking power. 

The following points must be observed during the test: 

• Do not press accelerator pedal 

• Drive position N (neutral) 

• Do not press the footbrake 


Replacing brake pads 

In order to replace the brake pads of the rear parking brake calipers, it is first necessary to turn back 
the drive spindle in the brake caliper. This can be done either with a special tool manually, or with 
help of the workshop system. The parking brake button is blocked to prevent use after activation of 
workshop mode via the workshop system. This prevents injury during the brake service. 

The parking brake button is enabled again at the start of a journey or after deactivation of workshop 
mode. 

The parking brake has a roller mode in order to permit determination of the brake forces on a brake 
test stand. This mode is detected automatically on the basis of a plausibility check (wheel speed 
comparison).

Emergency release 

A manual emergency release is possible via the spindle drives of the brake calipers. The actuator 
needs to be disassembled first. Following an emergency release, the electromechanical holding brake 
must be initialized.

Warnings 

The warning system for the RDCi tire pressure control has been continually developed and modified 
to meet customer needs during the various development stages. The warning system provides 
information promptly in the event of pressure deviations and thus makes an important contribution to 
avoiding vehicle breakdowns as a result of insufficient tire pressures. 

At present it is possible to distinguish between three warning levels. 

• Warning level 1 

Warning level 1 is a message to the customer that the tire pressure has dropped 21-25% 
tire pressure loss (cold pressure) as a result of natural diffusion (tire pressure loss). There are 
no technical problems and it is possible to drive on without concern. For this reason a CC 
message (tire inflation notice) is displayed to the driver for information. 

• Warning level 2 

The warning level 2 message is shown when the tire pressure has dropped below the legal thr 
eshold and the customer's comfort and safety is impaired. Accordingly, a yellow warning 
light is displayed to the driver in the instrument cluster KOMBI as well as a CC message 
(pressure warning). However, the customer can continue to drive moderately at up to 130 km/h 
(80 mph). The tire pressure should, however, be corrected as soon as possible.

• Warning level 3 

The yellow warning light is shown in the instrument cluster KOMBI if the tire pressure drops 
suddenly or falls below the threshold value of warning level 3 (tire pressure <1.5 bar). The 
driver also receives a CC message (breakdown warning) in which he is requested to stop 
carefully and visually check the tires. If possible, the tire pressure should be corrected. 

It is possible to drive on at a maximum speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) if you have run-flat tires (RSC). 

Notes for Service 

All 3 warnings are an indication of dropped tire pressure. The RDCi system is therefore working 
correctly and without faults since it performs its task of monitoring the tire pressures. Electrical vehicle 
diagnosis is not necessary in this case, as no fault memory entry has been stored. 

In the case of warning levels 2 and 3, the tire, tire valve and wheel rim must be additionally checked for 
tightness and damage. 

A 

The manufacturer's information must be observed in the event of any work on the wheels and tires, 
without fail. Failure to observe these requirements can lead to serious accidents. 


4.6.2. Electronic tire pressures plate 

As in the G30, the electronic tire pressure specification is also used in the G29. The adhesive 
tire pressure label is supplemented here by an additional user menu in the Central Information 
Display (CID). 

Unlike the tire pressures plate sticker, the electronic tire pressures plate permanently monitors the 
nominal pressures taking into consideration the current temperatures. This means that it determines 
the optimum tire pressure at any temperature and displays it in the central information display. 

A 

After the wheels have completed their teach-in drive, the nominal pressures can differ from the actual 
values determined and entered in the workshop. The background reason for this is the incorporation 
of the temperatures following a completed teach-in drive. The customer should be informed that 
although the tire pressures have been checked, these can constantly change depending on the 
temperature. However, the tire pressures should be adjusted again at an early opportunity if the 
difference is permanently more than 0.2 bar. 


A_ 

The displayed nominal pressure must be set if only the tire pressure is adjusted and no new wheels are 
fitted. Resetting the RDCi system (RDCi reset) as required on previous vehicles is no longer necessary. 
The RDCi warning pressures that are currently valid always relate to the nominal pressure displayed in 
the CID.

Wheel electronics 


This makes it possible to read tire-specific data, such as tire manufacturer, tire size and tire type, using 
a so-called RDC test tool and to send the data by radio to the corresponding wheel electronics. The 
calibration of the wheel electronics in the event of a tire change is made considerably easier. 

With the RDC test tool the tire pressures of the individual tires can also be read out. This can be useful 
for troubleshooting at the RDC system. 

Further information is provided in the product information for the ST1906 "RDC Tool". 


4.7. Steering 

The G29 has the Electronic Power Steering (EPS) with axially parallel design (EPS-APA), which is 
familiar from other series. 

The variable sport steering (SA 2VL) is used in the G29 as standard. The more direct steering gear 
ratio when compared to the basic version of the EPS and the reduced steering angle which is required 
as a result achieves a more direct vehicle response and higher agility. This comes in handy during 
avoidance manoeuvres for example. The steering column can be adjusted mechanically.

4.8. Electronic Damper Control (EDC) 


4.8.1. Overview 

The Electronic Damper Control (EDC) is a variable, electronically regulated shock absorber adjustment 
system for the control of the vertical dynamics and is used in the G29 with the chassis and suspension 
package "Adaptive M suspension" (SA 2VF). It improves the tire comfort of the vehicle while at the 
same time increasing the driving dynamics. The driver can choose between the more comfortable or 
more sporty sides of the vehicle's character by means of the drive dynamic control switch.
