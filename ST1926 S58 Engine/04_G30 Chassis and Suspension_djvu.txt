The double wishbone front axle offers the following advantages: 


• Lower wishbone level broken down into tension strut and wishbone. 

• Outstanding driving dynamics, high agility thanks to high achievable lateral acceleration. 

• Outstanding roll stabilization when cornering without any reduction in ride comfort. 

• High comfort due to minimum influence of disturbance variables. 

• High comfort thanks to shock absorbers that are practically free of lateral forces. 

• Smooth, good spring response of the axle and good directional stability. 

Since the wheel guide is taken care of by the two wishbone planes, practically no more lateral forces 
act on the shock absorber. Because of the lower friction that results from this, the shock absorber 
can react sensitively to irregularities in the road surface. The piston rod can be made thinner because 
of the freedom from lateral forces, which means that the friction in the shock absorber is reduced 
resulting in a more similar displacement volume in the traction and compression directions for the 
shock absorber. This is important for the use of an electronically adjustable shock absorber system. 

The front axle is almost entirely made of aluminium, which helps with axle-load distribution and the 
vehicle weight. 

The steering gear can be easily removed for repair if needed. Time-consuming dismantling of the front 
axle is unnecessary.

Axle support 


The five-link rear axle is characterized by precise wheel guidance with outstanding driving dynamics. 
This is particularly noticeable with respect to the following characteristics: 

• Directional stability, target precision 

• Load transfer characteristics 

• Self-steering response 

• Lane changing stability 

• Transient handling characteristics (cornering/straight-ahead driving) 

It has been possible to substantially reduce the conflict between the goals of driving dynamics and 
comfort by implementing the following measures: 

• Double-elastic mounting. 

Rubber mounts between rear axle differential, rear axle support and body. 

• Preload-reduced rear axle mounts. 

Lower torsion stress on the rear axle bearings thanks to spring struts positioned 
wide to the outside. 

• Large support area for the rear axle support. 

• Low unsprung mass thanks to innovative sheet steel wishbone technology in conjunction with 
aluminium forged wishbones and aluminium-wheel carriers. 

The large support for the rear axle support and the preload-reduced axle construction are of great 
significance for the outstanding driving dynamics on the one hand and for acoustic decoupling on 
the other hand. This makes it possible to install powerful, high-torque engines and to reduce the 
introduction of road noise into the vehicle.

G30 Chassis and Suspension 

2. Axles 


It has been possible to produce the various wishbones, with the exception of the upper wishbone, 
in a sheet steel design. Sheet steel wishbones offer similar weight advantages to aluminium forged 
wishbones, but are cheaper to produce. They are always used when a simple mounting geometry 
is used (straight wishbones). The top wishbone has been manufactured as an aluminium forged 
wishbone because of its more complex design. 


A 


Replacement of the rubber mounts on sheet steel wishbones as a service operation is not permitted. 
The entire wishbone must be replaced in the event of wear to a rubber mount.

Bonded brake pads 

Bonded brake pads are used on the front brakes of the G30. The bonded brake pads are substantially 
less intrusive with regard to interference noise.

Explanation

Brake pad paste

Pad backing plate 


The bonding surface of the brake pad must not be greased with the brake pad paste. The guides on 
the side must still be greased to ensure ease of movement of the brake pad in the brake caliper slot. 

Vibrations which may arise from movement between the pad backing plate and brake piston are 
prevented thanks to the rigid connection of the brake pad to the brake piston. 

A_ 

The bonding surface must never be greased with the brake pad paste. 


The surface of the brake piston connected to the bonded pad backing plate must be cleaned 
thoroughly before new bonded brake pads are flitted. 

The brake pedal must be depressed for about 1 minute after new bonded brake pads have been fitted. 
This ensures that a reliable bonded connection is achieved between the brake piston and pad backing 
plate. 

The brake pads must be replaced if the bonded connection does not hold. Reusing the original pads is 
not permitted. 

A 

The bonded connection between the brake piston and pad backing plate must not be separated with a 
hammer or screwdriver, but only with a plastic wedge, so as not to damage the brake caliper.

4.2.1. Warnings 

The warning system for the tire pressure control has been continually developed and modified to meet 
customer needs during the various development stages. The warning system provides information 
promptly in the event of pressure deviations and thus makes an important contribution to avoiding 
vehicle breakdowns as a result of insufficient tire pressures. 

At present it is possible to distinguish between three warning levels.

4.2.2. Notes for Service 

All three warnings are an indication of a loss in tire pressure. The system is working correctly and 
faultlessly as to monitor the tire pressures. Electrical vehicle diagnosis is not necessary in this case, 
as no fault memory entry has been stored. 

In the event of warning level 2 and warning level 3, the tire and the tire valve must also be checked for 
leaks or damage. 

A_ 

The manufacturer's information must be observed in the event of any work on the wheels and tires. 
Failure to observe these requirements can lead to serious accidents. 


4.3. Tire pressures 

Optimum adjustment of tire pressure is necessary for the following reasons: 

• Best possible driving dynamics. 

• Maximum utilization of tire service life. 

• Reduction of the fuel consumption. 

• Optimum operation of various suspension control systems. 

For this, the physical principles should be observed in combination with pressure and temperature. 
The following rule of thumb applies: So a temperature change for every +/- 10 °C or+/- 18 °F 
relates to an increase or decrease in tire pressure of roughly +/- 0.1 bar or 1.4 psi. Please refer to the 
temperature chart below.

Temperature chart 

The tire pressures specified by the manufacturer apply for summer and winter operation, irrespective 
of the temperature. However, it must be observed that due to the seasonal temperature differences, 
the tire pressures should be checked frequently. 


4.3.1. Cold Tire pressure 

If the tire air temperature is the same as the current ambient temperature, this is referred to as cold tire 
pressure. The tire pressures should only be changed with a cold tire pressure on vehicles without the 
electronic tire pressure label. 


4.3.2. Warm Tire pressure 

During longer trips at higher driving speeds the tire warms up due to the friction with the road surface. 
The temperature of the tire increases as a result and this is accompanied by an increase in tire 
pressure. 


29 










G30 Chassis and Suspension 

4. Wheels/Tires 


If there is a significant difference between ambient temperature and tire air temperature this is always 
referred to as warm tire pressure. Avoid changing the tire pressures when the tire is warm on vehicles 
without the electronic tire pressure label. 


4.4. Electronic tire pressure label 


4.4.1. Technical functional description 

An electronic tire pressure label is being used for the first time at BMW. The tire pressure label sticker 
has been supplemented in the G30 by an additional user menu in the Central Information Display 
(CID). 

Tire pressures are changing constantly depending on tire air temperature. A change in the tire air 
temperature for every +/- 10 °C or +/- 18 °F corresponds to a pressure increase or pressure decrease 
of +/- 0.1 bar or 1.4 psi. For this reason, you may see a warning message of insufficient tire pressure if 
your tires have cooled significantly. In many of these cases, there is not technical fault, but insufficient 
checking of the tire pressures which should be checked at regular intervals. 

Unlike the tire pressure sticker, the electronic tire pressure label permanently monitors the nominal 
pressures taking into consideration the current temperatures. This means that it determines and 
displays the optimum tire pressure at any temperature.

Index 

Explanation 

A 

Electronic tire pressure label in the CID 

B 

Tire pressure information label 


Once you have selected the relevant tire type (summer/winter), the tire size on the rear axle and max 
speed range, the appropriate tire pressures are output to the CID (nominal pressure). Following the 
input and before the teach-in drive, these correspond to the tire pressures on the tire pressure label. 

The vehicle must then be driven so it can learn the new size wheels and tires. Once the teach-in drive 
has been successfully completed, the current optimum tire pressure taking into consideration the 
tire air temperatures is always displayed. This can differ from the information on the conventional tire 
pressure label on the B-pillar because it has taken the tire air temperatures into consideration. Correct 
tire pressures reduce fuel consumption and ensure greater driving safety. 


30 





G30 Chassis and Suspension 

4. Wheels/Tires 


The tire air temperatures are measured by the four wheel electronics units in the various wheels. Since 
the wheel electronics units do not begin transmitting until driving speed has reached 20 km/h (12 
mph), it is not possible to determine this while the vehicle is parked. A substitute value can be formed 
using the outside temperature sensor when the vehicle is stationary for wheels that have already been 
taught-in (see the following chapter “Measurement of tire air temperatures when stationary”). 

When new wheels and tires are installed, for example during a wheel change in the workshop, 
the nominal pressure (cold tire pressure) can generally be used. When wheels are changed in the 
winter, however, the great temperature difference between the ambient temperature and the current 
temperature of the tire (difference between workshop temperature and ambient temperature) must 
be taken into consideration. In this case, the tire pressure from the conventional tire pressure label 
should be corrected upwards somewhat. A temperature difference for every +/- 10 °C corresponds to 
approximately 0.1 bar tire pressure change.

After the wheels have completed their teach-in drive, the nominal pressures can differ from the actual 
values determined and entered in the workshop. The background reason for this is the incorporation 
of the temperatures following a completed teach-in drive. The customer should be informed that 
although the tire pressures have been checked, these can constantly change depending on the 
temperature. However, the tire pressures should be adjusted again at an early opportunity if the 
difference is permanently more than 0.2 bar / 2.9 psi.

A distinction must be made when using the electronic tire pressure label in the following three 
situations: 

• Checking the tire pressures. 

• Checking the tire pressures after a wheel/tire change. 

• Checking the tire pressures of wheel and tire combinations 

that have not been saved (special sizes). 

The relationships and the special features of operation are described in greater detail below.

Adjustment of the tire pressures for wheels that have already been taught-in in the Central Information Display on the G30 

If the tire pressures have to be checked, it is only necessary to call up the Tire Pressure Monitor (TPM) 
menu and compare the relevant nominal pressures displayed with the actual pressures. It must be 
noted here that the wheel and tire combination stored must match the wheel sizes actually fitted to the 
vehicle. The difference displayed must then be corrected with the help of a tire filling station. It is not 
necessary to reset the tire pressure control as it was on previous systems. 

A warning issued by the Tire Pressure Monitor (TPM) always relates to the current nominal pressure. 

A_ _ _ 

There is no TPM reset provision for the wheel and tire combinations stored (standard sizes). The TPM 
warnings always relate to the nominal pressure displayed. No nominal pressure is displayed if special 
sizes have been selected. In this case, it is still necessary to carry out a manual TPM reset (see "tire 
Selection: Special Sizes" chapter).

Adjustment of the tire sizes to be set on new wheels in the Central Information Display on the G30 


The procedure for setting a new tire type is only necessary under the following conditions: 

• A new set of wheels has been fitted. 

• The max vehicle speed has changed. 

• The wheel and tire combination stored in the Central Information Display (CID) does not 
correspond to the actual combination. 

The nominal pressures displayed after the input and confirmation of a new tire type always relate to 
the cold tire pressure. It is not possible to compare actual and nominal pressures through the Central 
Information Display (CID) as the system assumes that a new set of wheels has been fitted and its 
wheel electronics do not transmit any tire pressures while the vehicle is stationary. 

A warning message may be displayed in the event of incorrect operation of the system. If, for instance, 
a new tire type is selected and confirmed after a long highway journey, although the wheels currently 
fitted have not been swapped, there will be considerable pressure deviations between the nominal 
pressure displayed in the CID (cold tire pressure) and the actual tire pressure on the wheels (warm tire 
pressure) because of the temperature differences. The pressure deviation described can, however, 
only be determined using a tire inflator, as the system does not display any actual pressure on the CID 
after confirmation of the new tire type. There could be a new warning message in the subsequent 
teach-in drive if the tire pressures (warm tire pressure) in the wheels were now to be adjusted to the 
nominal pressure displayed on the CID (cold tire pressure) using the tire inflator. 


36 




G30 Chassis and Suspension 

4. Wheels/Tires 


The background reason for this is the incorporation of the tire air temperatures transmitted. When 
the vehicle is in motion, the wheel electronics are constantly transmitting logs with the following 
information: 

• Identification number ID 

• Battery status 

• Tire pressure 

• Tire air temperature 

During the teach-in drive the system detects a warm tire and calculates a higher tire pressure for 
inflation than the nominal pressure displayed before starting the drive (cold tire pressure). The 
difference between the nominal pressure and the actual pressure can now be seen in the tire pressure 
control menu. The tire pressure must be adjusted again. 

When new wheels are fitted, for example during a wheel change in the workshop, the temperature 
difference between the ambient temperature and the current temperature of the tire (workshop 
temperature and ambient temperature) must therefore still be taken into account.

Correct responses must be given for the following prompts in the menu to enter new wheel and tire 
combinations.

This function should be used for special tire sizes only. There is no specification of the tire pressure 
for this selection. Following confirmation of the special tire sizes and adjustment of the tire pressure, 
the TPM learns the set tire pressure after a successful teach-in drive. This means that the warning 
threshold values are calculated by the TPM system using the tire pressure currently set. This function 
in this menu is identical to that of previous TPM systems. The tire pressures must always be reset in 
the special sizes menu after any change (TPM reset). It is not possible to perform a nominal/actual 
comparison of the various tire pressures (no nominal pressure output). 

In exceptional cases, this function can also be used to accommodate special customer requirements. 
The output of the nominal pressure can be disabled by selecting the special sizes if a customer does 
not wish to accept the nominal pressures displayed. This makes it possible to teach-in an individual 
tire pressure for the TPM system warning threshold values.

In general, the specified minimum pressures must be observed when teaching-in new tire pressures. 
For example, it is not possible to teach-in tire pressures < 2.0 bar / 29 psi. In this event, a tire pressure 
loss warning will be output during the teach-in time. 

4.4.5. Tire pressure loss display 

If the tire pressure falls below the stored warning threshold values the driver is informed, whether it 
is a case of sudden tire pressure loss or gradual tire pressure drop immediately through the Central

Once the tire pressures appear on the CID, the system has completed the wheel assignment (second 
teach-in time).

Central Information Display (CID) 


In the case of wheel electronics that have already been taught-in, the current tire pressures are 
output through the Central Information Display (CID) even if the vehicle is stationary. However, the 
relevant tire air temperatures are required before the system can display the tire pressures that are 
currently applicable. These are determined and forwarded by the four wheel electronics units at 
regular intervals when the vehicle is in motion. Since the wheel electronics do not transmit while the 
vehicle is stationary, the tire air temperatures can only be retrieved while the vehicle is in motion. 

When the vehicle is at a standstill, the tire air temperature is calculated using a special algorithm 
(calculation model). The information from the outside temperature sensor is required for this. 

Once the calculation is complete, the specified tire pressures are output from the DSC to the CID.

The wheel electronics send data logs to the remote control service (FBD) up to a driving speed of 
about 20 km/h (12 mph). The logs are forwarded from there via the Body Domain Controller (BDC) to 
the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). 

The data log sent last, before the vehicle stops is saved with the corresponding tire air temperature. 
At the same time the ambient temperature is determined from the outside temperature sensor and 
saved. The tire air temperature currently valid is then calculated using these two values, taking into 
consideration the time for which the vehicle has been stopped. An algorithm is stored in the DSC for 
this. After no more than 2 hours the tires will have cooled down so much that the tire air temperature 
matches the ambient temperature.

As is already familiar from the G12, the G30 does not have Integrated Chassis Management (ICM). The 
ICM functions are distributed between the optional equipment system (SAS) and the Dynamic Stability 
Control (DSC). 

It has been possible to further improve the driving dynamics in the G30 by selective use of various 
control functions. This is particularly keenly felt in relation to the steering behavior, the traction and the 
vehicle's stability. 

The control units necessary to meet the requirements on driving dynamics are located on the FlexRay 
bus. This allows them to quickly exchange their information with each other and react to events. 

The following actuators are activated as needed: 

• Rear axle slip angle control HSR (optional equipment) 

• Electronic Power Steering EPS (standard equipment) 

• DME engine control unit 

• VTG transfer case (optional equipment) 

• Electric active roll stabilization at the front and rear (EARSV/EARSH) (optional equipment) 

• Electronic Damper Control (EDC) (optional equipment) 

The tables below provide an overview of the various control functions and their effects on the 
drivability.

5.1. Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

Alongside the Vertical Dynamics Platform (VDP) control unit, the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 
represents the core element of the driving dynamics control systems used to increase active safety. It 
optimizes driving stability in all driving conditions and also traction when driving off and accelerating. 

Furthermore, it identifies unstable driving conditions such as under or oversteering and helps maintain 
the stability of the vehicle.

5.1.1. Functions 

Modern DSC units have a variety of different functions with the help of which they support the driver in 
hazardous situations and in sporty driving. 


Function 

Description 

ABS 

Antilock Brake System 

Prevents the wheels from locking under braking. 

EBV 

Electronic brake force 
distribution 

Regulates distribution of the brake force to the front and rear 
axles depending on the load status of the vehicle. 

CBC 

Cornering Brake Control 

Regulates brake pressure under braking when cornering. 

DBC 

Dynamic Brake Control 

Applies maximum brake pressure in the event of panic braking 
and thus shortens the stopping distance. 

ASC 

Automatic Stability Control 

Prevents the drive wheels spinning when driving off by 
intervening in the engine and brakes. 

MSR 

Engine drag torque control 

Prevents the drive wheels locking up because of braking by the 
motor when there is a low coefficient of friction with the road 
surface. 

DSC 

Dynamic Stability Control 

Prevents understeer or oversteer in all driving situations by 
selective braking and engine management interventions on 
individual wheels. 

DTC 

Dynamic Traction Control 

Reduces DSC interventions and thus enhances drive on loose 
surfaces. 

DBC 

Dynamic Brake Control 

Detects panic braking and supports the driver through immediate 
application of maximum brake pressure. 

ADB 

Automatic Differential Brake 

Replicates the function of a differential lock. 

If a wheel displays a tendency to spin, this wheel is automatically 
braked so that propulsion can still be achieved via the other 
wheel of the driven axle. 

Hydraulic brake-servo 
assistance 

Increases the brake pressure applied hydraulically in the event of 
failure of the brake servo or vacuum supply. 

Brake drying 

Dries the friction surface of the brake disc by cyclically applying 
the brake pads in rain (no braking perceptible). 


51 













G30 Chassis and Suspension 

5. Driving Stability Control 


Function 

Description 

Brake standby 

Builds up a moderate brake pressure when the driver takes his 
foot off the accelerator pedal very quickly. This means that the 
braking effect will begin sooner in the event of subsequent panic 
braking. 

Fading Brake Support 

Supports the driver when braking if the brake temperature has 
become very high due to an extreme driving style and the desired 
deceleration can be achieved only by applying a higher brake 
force. 

Drive-off assistant 

Holds the vehicle for approximately 1.5 seconds on uphill 
gradients although the driver has already released the brake. 

This means that the driver can drive off comfortably, without the 
vehicle rolling back down the hill unintentionally. 

Automatic Hold 

Automatically holds the vehicle after it has come to a standstill 
without it being necessary to still press the brake when the drive 
position is selected. The brake is automatically released again on 
subsequent acceleration. There is a button to enable and disable 
the function manually. 

Electric parking brake 

When the parking brake button is pressed the DSC control unit 
controls the two actuators on the rear axle brake caliper. The two 
electric motors in the actuators operate a spindle drive which 
uses the brake piston to press the brake pads against the brake 
disc with a high preload force. 

Brake pad wear detection 

Monitors the front left and rear right brake pads for wear and 
reports a corresponding service requirement through the KOMBI 
instrument cluster or the Central Information Display (CID). 

Tire pressure control 

Monitors the current tire pressures on all wheels and provides 
information when pressures fall below stored warning threshold 
values by issuing corresponding instructions. 


The Hill Descent Control (HDC) is no longer used on passenger cars with xDrive, HDC is currently only 
used on the X models. (X5, X6 etc.) 


5.2. Steering 

The G30 has Electronic Power Steering (EPS) in the following different versions: 

• Standard steering 12V 

• Integral Active Steering 12V

The electrical active stabilizers (EARS) had their series introduction in the G12. The stabilizers are 
available to the customer only as optional equipment in conjunction with further suspension control 
systems (see Highlights chapter). The system has been adopted in full in the G30 with the exception of 
the preview function. 

The preview function, which was implemented on the G12 using the stereo camera, is not used on the 
G30. For this reason, the name of the optional equipment has been changed from “Executive Drive 
Pro” on the G12 to “Adaptive Drive” or “ Dynamic Handling Package” on the G30.
