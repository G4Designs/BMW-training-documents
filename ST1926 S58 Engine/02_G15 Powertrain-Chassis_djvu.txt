2.1.5. Vacuum supply 

Vehicles equipped with a gasoline engine and conventional brake system require a vacuum pump to 
boost the pedal force. In vehicles equipped with a gasoline engine and DSCi brake system, a vacuum 
booster is not required as the pedal force is generated hydraulically in the DSCi brake system. 

A vacuum pump is therefore omitted with the M850i xDrive.

Electrical exhaust flaps 

The 2 exhaust flaps, which are installed downstream of the rear silencer on the outer exhaust tailpipes 
can be adjusted with the assistance of an e-motor. 

The e-motor is activated by the Digital Motor Electronics through pulse-width modulation. 

The following input variables are taken into account for this: 

• Engine speed 

• Engine load 

• Driving speed 

The various driving modes also influence the exhaust flap control. 

The electrical exhaust flaps are always open in the SPORT and SPORT PLUS driving modes. In the 
ECO PRO and COMFORT driving modes, they are only open up to a speed of 15 km/h (10 mph) or an 
engine speed higher than 4000 rpm.

• = exhaust flaps open 

An intermediate setting of the exhaust flaps is not possible. They are either fully open or closed. If 
faults are detected or the actuation stops, or after the engine has been stopped, the preferred position 
is the closed position. 

A 

The e-motor of the exhaust flap can be replaced separately. The exhaust flaps can be placed in an 
installation position with the help of the workshop diagnosis system ISTA. 


A _ 

Note that the exhaust flaps may be closed when the vehicle is idling. As such, no emission 
measurement can be performed at these exhaust tailpipes. 


2.1.8. Cooling 

An additional cooling package is used for optimum cooling. This consists of an additional upstream 
coolant radiator including front spoiler lip.

Engine control unit N63B44T3 

One control unit is used per cylinder bank in the 8-cylinder engine. The actuators and sensors 
of cylinder bank 1 are assigned to the DME-1 control unit. Accordingly the DME-2 control unit is 
responsible for the functions of cylinder bank 2. The DME-1 is the main control unit and also accepts 
any information relevant to the entire engine, e.g. the crankshaft sensor signal. The DME-1 makes 
this information available to the DME-2 control unit directly via the bus system. Due to the variety of 
sensors and actuators it was deemed necessary to use 2 control units. 

The integrated supply module is also on the engine control unit. It supplies the engine control units 
and various sensors and actuators with the required supply voltage.

3.1.4. Sports automatic transmission 

In the G15, the sports automatic transmission variant GA8X76D with Steptronic is used. The customer 
has 2 shift paddles on the steering wheel and additional functions such as: 

• Launch Control 

• Manual start "coasting in idle" 

• Driving into the speed limiter. 

3.1.5. Functional enhancements 

The function "driving into the speed limiter" have been expanded. 

Driving into the speed limiter 

Driving into the speed limiter irrespective of the driving mode is now possible for BMW M850i xDrive. 
To do so, as is the case with other vehicles, the manual shift mode and Dynamic Traction Control 
(DTC) must be activated (briefly press the DSC button). 

3.1.6. Transmission emergency release 

In the event of a breakdown, emergency release of the automatic transmission is possible in 2 different 
ways. 


• Mechanical transmission emergency release 

• Electronic transmission emergency release. 

The procedures to be followed for mechanical and electronic transmission emergency release are 
along the same lines as those for 8HPTU automatic transmission. 

A 

Before performing a mechanical or electronic transmission emergency release, the vehicle must be 
secured to prevent it from rolling away. 


Detailed information on the electronic transmission emergency release is provided in the 
corresponding repair instructions and in the Owner's Handbook.

The regulated rear axle differential lock makes possible the reduction of the slip between right and left 
rear wheel by joining both wheels via a multidisc clutch. If required, the clutch package can be closed 
via an e-motor. A lock-up torque of up to 1500 Nm can be made available irrespective of the requested 
drive torque of the engine. 

The advantages of the controlled rear axle differential lock are: 

• Improved handling 

• Improved traction 

• Greater driving stability. 


The regulated rear axle differential lock is based on the active M differential of BMW M GmbH.

3.3.2. System overview 

The central system for controlling the regulated rear axle differential lock is the Dynamic Stability 
Control integrated DSCi. It evaluates the driving dynamic parameters provided by other sensors and 
control units and forwards the calculated lock-up torque to be set to the control unit for the regulated 
rear axle differential lock (GHAS). 

The DSCi can also request separate and higher-level locking interventions to stabilise and enhance 
the agility of the vehicle when the DSC control system is activated and also deactivated. The following 
diagram shows the information required for the functioning of the regulated rear axle differential lock:

The electric motor (1) with transfer box (2) is screwed on at the housing. The pressure disc with the 
second ball ramp half (5) is fixed in the housing. The mobile components of the ball ramp (3 and 4) 
generate the necessary axial displacement of the fixed pressure disc (5) with the aid of the transfer box 
(2). These components are not subject to the differential transmission rotation and are disconnected 
from the rotating components by an axial needle bearing (18). 

The components with the index 6 to 20 belong to the differential gear. 

The lock is effected between the right output (14) and the differential housing (11) and counteracts 
a difference in speed between the output bevel gears (9 and 13). The disc spring (17) opens the lock 
when current is not supplied to the e-motor.

Electric motor 


An e-motor controls the lock-up torque to be set via the multidisc clutch. 



Index 

Explanation 

1 

Transfer box 

2 

Electric motor 


The rotational movement of the e-motor is transmitted via the transfer box with ball ramp. This 
produces an axial force which compresses the multidisc clutch. Depending on this contact pressure 
the multidisc clutch transmits more or less lock-up torque. The control is effected via the angle of 
rotation of the e-motor. This is determined with the assistance of engine-internal hall effect sensors. 


35 












G15 Powertrain/Chassis 

3. Gearbox 


The electric motor consists of: 

• Engine 

• Temperature sensor 

• 2 hall effect sensors. 

A temperature sensor, also installed in the electric motor, is used to protect the electric motor against 
overheating. To determine the position of the electric motor, 2 hall effect sensors in the engine are 
used. 

A recalibration of the characteristic curve of the lock-up torque via the engine position is regularly 
performed to compensate the wear in the clutch. To be able to assign a certain position of the 
electric motor a corresponding coupling lock-up torque and to take the wear influences into account 
while doing so, a reference run is performed after the combustion engine is switched off. During 
this reference run the engine is subjected to a defined current level. The lock-up torque of 0 Nm is 
assigned to the resulting position. 

Temperature monitoring 

Three temperature sensors in total are used to protect the components against overheating. 

The temperature of the control unit GHAS (driver output stage), temperature of the e-motor and 
transmission oil temperature are monitored. 

Control unit for regulated rear axle differential lock (GHAS) 

In the G15, the control unit of the regulated rear axle differential lock (GHAS) is in the rear area of the 
vehicle and is screwed to the support of the rear trim panel. 



G15 mounting orientation of GHAS 


3.3.4. Operating principle 

The drive torque to be transmitted at the wheels of the rear axle is calculated in the DSCi and is 
forwarded to the regulated rear axle differential lock (GHAS) control unit via the FlexRay bus. The 
GHAS calculates the adjusting torque to be set at the toothed mobile adjusting disc from the 
requested drive torque. 


36 






G15 Powertrain/Chassis 

3. Gearbox 


The adjusting torque required for control is generated by the electric motor. The rotational movement 
of the electric motor is converted to an axial movement by a ball ramp mechanism and the clutch 
package of the multidisc clutch is closed or open. 

If the multidisc clutch is opened, the drive torque is distributed evenly between the right and left wheel. 
This means that 50% of the drive torque is applied to both wheels on the rear axle. 



Regulated rear axle differential lock, drive torque distribution 


Index 

Explanation 

A 

Drive torque distribution with multidisc clutch open 

B 

Maximum drive torque distribution with closed multidisc clutch and lock-up 
torque up to 1500 Nm (left wheel in snow) 


In the event of a driving situation where it is necessary to shift the drive torque from one wheel to 
the other, the multidisc clutch is closed with the aid of the e-motor until the desired drive torque 
distribution is set. 

The maximum lock-up torque of the regulated rear axle differential lock is 1500 Nm. This means 
that the entire drive torque can be applied to only one rear wheel if required. This corresponds to a 
100 % locking effect. If the required lock-up torque is higher than the maximum achievable torque of 
1500 Nm, the controlled rear axle differential lock will no longer be able to lock 100%. 

3.3.5. Operating strategy 

The regulated rear axle differential lock system is a proactive system that adapts the drive torque at 
the rear axle to the current driving situation using a variety of sensors. By evaluating all driving data in 
the DSC control unit a driving situation where a shift of the drive torque at the rear axle is useful can be 
detected in advance. An optimum drive torque distribution for the vehicle can be generated through 
interaction with the xDrive all-wheel system. 

An adapted e-motor control In the SPORT and SPORT PLUS driving modes leads to more agile and 
manoeuvrable drivability. The traction of the vehicle is also increased in the SPORT driving mode with 
e-motor control. 

The DSC status (DSC activated/deactivated, DTC activated/deactivated) also influences the 
characteristics of the functions. With Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) and deactivated DSC (DSC off), 
an adapted e-motor control also leads to more agile and manoeuvrable drivability. The agile drivability 
is most pronounced with deactivated DSC.

The following table provides an overview of the driving situations in which the regulated rear axle 
differential lock is active: 


Driving situation 

Regulated rear axle differential lock action 

Driving off 

Generation of lock-up torque. 

Road with different 
coefficient of friction on 
right and left 

In the case of an emerging difference in speed at the rear axle, the 
drive torque is transmitted to the wheel that can transmit more 
driving power. 

Accelerated cornering 

Additional drive torque is transmitted to the outer cornering wheel 
via the wheel slip of the inner cornering wheel. 

Load reversal upon 
cornering or lane change 

A stabilizing torque is generated from the yaw-rate signal if 
oversteering is detected. 

Oversteering 

The lock is closed in the event of deliberately induced oversteering. 
The yaw-rate signal and accelerator pedal position are used to 
detect this kind of situation. 


The regulation and the operating principle of the regulated rear axle differential lock are explained 
below using examples of driving situations: 

Driving off with similar coefficient of friction on right and left 

When driving off the clutch is closed in order to achieve the maximum traction. If the maximum lock-up 
value is no longer required when driving off, the clutch is opened further again. 

Cornering 

When steering into a corner, drive torque is transmitted from the inner cornering wheel to the outer 
cornering wheel. This increases the steerability of the vehicle. If the vehicle changes direction, the 
drive torque is shifted so that the vehicle remains stable. When accelerating out of a bend/corner, the 
drive torque is then shifted back again to the outer cornering wheel. 

Stabilization upon cornering or lane change 

In the case of fast lane changes or upon cornering, all vehicles are prone to significant yaw responses 
and the vehicle may end up oversteering, for example. If the Dynamic Stability Control integrated 
DSCi system detects a deviation between the driver's choice and the vehicle response, the vehicle is 
stabilized by means of xDrive control and the regulated rear axle differential lock. 

In this situation the regulated rear axle differential lock distributes the drive torque to both sides 
as needed in order to prevent oversteering. It is possible to largely do without decelerating brake 
interventions. The vehicle handling is more stable as a result and the driving dynamics is increased. 

As a result, the driver can accelerate very quickly out of a bend/corner, for example.

3.3.7. Notes for Service 

Oil change 

The oil filling of the rear axle differential lock is designed for the entire service life of the assembly. 

A 

BMW AG vehicles with regulated rear axle differential lock are not designed for use on racing tracks. 

In the case of use on racing tracks very high temperatures may arise in the rear axle differential which 
may lead to premature wear of the rear axle differential oil. In the case of a customer complaint "Noises 
from the rear axle differential", before replacing the entire component it may be worth changing the oil 
first to see if this resolves the problem. 


Classification 

Due to the component tolerances of the different components of the regulated rear axle differential 
lock, the stroke of the ball ramp for closing the multidisc clutch may differ in each case. However, these 
tolerances can be compensated by adapted control of the electric motor for closing the multidisc 
clutch. 

The respective tolerance or classification code is determined during production and printed on 
the type plate of the regulated rear axle differential lock. This type plate is located on the top of the 
regulated rear axle differential lock.

The tolerance can be determined as follows in Service: 

• Read out of the classification code via the workshop diagnosis system ISTA. 

• Read off the classification code on the type plate of the rear axle differential (rear axle 
differential may need to be lowered). 

The 16-digit classification code can be entered in the control unit for the regulated rear axle differential 
lock (GHAS) using the service function "Correction value of characteristic curve" in the workshop 
diagnosis system ISTA. 


41 















G15 Powertrain/Chassis 

3. Gearbox 


After the following servicing work has been carried out, the classification code must be 
manually entered in the GHAS control unit: 

• Rear axle differential was renewed 

• If the data of the old GHAS control unit can no longer be read out when renewing the GHAS 
control unit 

• For fault elimination, if invalid or missing correction values were identified in the control unit. 


A_ 

Only the data printed on the type plate can be entered. Incorrectly entered data lead to a decline of the 
traction or increased wear. 


Service functions 

At the time this product information was created, three service functions were available for the 
regulated rear axle differential lock: 

• Delete wear data: This service function must be carried out after the renewal of the electric 
motor or the entire rear axle differential. 

• Renew GHAS control unit: This service function must be carried out after the renewal of 
the GHAS control unit. This service function is also performed automatically as a post¬ 
programming follow-up operation. 

• Correction values of characteristic curve: This service function must be carried out after the 
renewal of the rear axle differential or if the individual data recovery for the GHAS control unit 
failed. In this case, the classification code on the type plate of the rear axle differential must be 
read off.

5. Wheels/Tires 


5.1. Tires 

Just like the vehicle, the tires of the G15 have been designed for sporting character and driving 
dynamics. The vehicle is delivered as standard with mixed tires. The tires used on the rear axle are 
therefore wider than those on the front axle. This meant that it was possible to base the chassis and 
suspension design on the significantly higher cornering potential of wide rear axle tires. 

The following tires are used as standard for the M840i xDrive model: 

• Front: 8 x 20, 245/35 R20 

• Rear: 9 x 20, 275/30 R20

6.2. Stiffening measures 

The vehicle is designed to ensure a high basic rigidity. This was achieved by installing the following 
components: 

• Front-end struts 

• Torsion struts on front axle 

• Stiffening plate on front and rear axle. 


6.2.1. Front-end struts 

To increase the rigidity of the vehicle, front-end struts were installed in the engine compartment. 
The front-end struts are fastened to the die-cast aluminum spring strut dome and cross-connection 
support plate of the engine compartment.

The screw cycles on the aluminum pressure cast spring strut dome must be noted. It may be 
necessary to rework the threads on the aluminum pressure cast spring strut dome using threaded 
inserts to ensure their strength after multiple screw cycles. 

To perform the necessary servicing, observe the information and specifications of the documents in 
ISTA in each case which are updated on a daily basis. 


6.2.2. Measures for front and rear axle 

In addition to the stiffening plate on the front axle, a new stiffening plate is used on the rear axle of the 
G15. Torsion struts are used on the front axle. These measures increase the rigidity of the vehicle and 
allow a more sporty chassis and suspension setting.

6.3. Suspension systems 

The axles of the G15 are designed, as is the entire vehicle, for sporting character and driving dynamics. 
The wheel guidance has been optimized by increasing the negative camber on the front and rear axle 
(compared to the G30). 


6.3.1. Front axle 

A double-wishbone front axle is used in the G15. The bearings of the front axle wishbone were 
specially developed for the vehicle and are harder, e.g. than those in the G30. A rubber mount 
originating from the F90 is used on the upper wishbone.

The brake system has the following driving characteristics: 

• Outstanding driving dynamics and vehicle control due to the dynamics and precision of the 
vehicle stabilization 

• More sporting character and feeling of safety due to a brake pedal feel short travel and 
effective modulation 

• Increased active safety due to shorter stopping distances combined with assistance systems 

• Due to the fast pressure build-up, much faster and more precise interventions can be achieved 
compared to previous brake systems. 

6.4.2. Special features 

The DSCi brake system is characterized by the following technical features: 

• Electro-hydraulic brake-by-wire braking function 

• Changeover from front/back to diagonal brake force distribution 

• Changeover from a brake fluid level switch to a brake fluid level sensor 

• Vacuum supply omitted 

• Vacuum brake servo omitted 

• Integration of the tandem brake master cylinder 

• Integrated brake pedal travel sensor.

6.4.3. Brake functions 


Function 

Explanation 

Antilock Brake System 
(ABS) 

Prevents blocking of individual wheels when braking by means 
of targeted modulation of brake pressures. Vehicle steerability is 
maintained. 

Cornering Brake Control 
(CBC) 

Prevents the vehicle from turning in when braking gently and when 
subjected to a high degree of lateral acceleration by adjusting the 
control of the brake pressures. The cornering stability is improved. 

Automatic Stability 
Control (ASC) 

Prevents the drive wheels from spinning by targeted braking of these 
wheels and adaptation of the drive torque delivered by the engine. 

Vehicle propulsion is optimized as a result and driving stability is 
maintained. 

Dynamic Brake Control 
(DBC) 

In the event of panic braking initiated by the driver, the system supports 
the driver by automatically immediately applying the maximum brake 
pressure to ensure the best possible deceleration. 

Dynamic Stability 

Control (DSC) 

If the vehicle starts to understeer or oversteer, it is stabilized by targeted 
brake interventions at individual wheels. 

Automatic Differential 
Brake (ADB-X) 

Simulates the function of the differential lock. If a wheel displays a 
tendency to spin, this wheel is automatically braked so that propulsion 
can still be achieved via the other wheel of the driven axle. 

Dynamic Traction 

Control (DTC) 

In cooperation with ASC and DSC, the intervention thresholds on 
normal road surfaces are widened, for example, to enable an even 
sportier driving style without intervention. On loose surfaces, such as 
snow, sand or gravel, maximum forward momentum is achieved. 

Brake standby 

Builds up a moderate brake pressure in the system when the driver 
takes his foot off the accelerator pedal quickly. The braking effect then 
acts more quickly if the driver then performs panic braking. 

Dry by applying brake 

Depending on operation of the wiper, applies the brake pads gently at 
intervals in order to clean (dry) the brake discs. The braking effect is 
significantly improved by this when the vehicle is braked. 

Drive-off assistant 

Holds the vehicle on inclines for roughly 1.5 seconds as soon as the 
driver releases the brake pedal in order to drive off. This means that the 
driver can drive off comfortably, without the vehicle rolling back down 
the hill unintentionally. 

Automatic Hold 

Automatically holds the vehicle after it has come to a standstill without 
it being necessary to still press the brake when the drive position is 
selected. The brake is automatically released when the accelerator 
pedal is pressed and the vehicle drives off normally. The function can 
be switched on and off by means of a button.

6.5. Electronic Damper Control EDC High 

6.5.1. Overview 

The Electronic Damper Control (EDC) with compression and rebound stage control is used as 
standard in the G15 and is a variable, electronically-controlled shock absorber adjustment system 
for controlling the vertical dynamics. The vertical dynamics platform VDP control unit uses various 
data such as body movement, transverse and longitudinal acceleration, steering angle and the road 
condition to calculate wheel-individual control commands for the electrical control valves in the shock 
absorbers.

5 Crash Safety Module (ACSM) 


The electronically regulated shock absorbers form a unit in combination with the respective spring 
strut. There are 2 electric control valves on each shock absorber which allow the compression and 
rebound stages of the regulated shock absorbers to be adjusted separately. This improves the tire 
comfort of the vehicle while at the same time increasing the driving dynamics. The retraction and 
extension speeds of the shock absorbers are determined by means of the ride height sensors. The 
driver can use the Driving Experience Control to select a comfortable, soft or sporty taut chassis and 
suspension setting.
