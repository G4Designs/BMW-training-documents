G12 Climate Control 

1. Introduction 

1.1. In general 

The climate control system in the new G12 BMW 7 Series has been updated from previous systems. 
A newly developed 4 zone heating and air-conditioning unit is used on all G12 models. 

A brushless blower motor integrated into the heating and air-conditioning unit provides the supply of 
fresh air to the vehicle interior via 2 microfilters. The microfilters as well as the blower motor can be 
accessed from the right footwell. 

The IHKA control unit is part of the heating and air-conditioning control panel. 

A__ _ 

Work on heating and air-conditioning systems must only be performed by competent and qualified 
personnel. Workshop personnel performing activities in connection with heating and air-conditioning 
systems in vehicles require a certificate of training. 


1.2. Refrigerant 

In the US market R134a will still be used. R1234yf will be used in the G12 starting in 03/16 , and in the 
remaining US vehicles from 07/16. 


1.3. Overview 

The 4-zone version of the integrated automatic heating/air conditioning system (IHKA) is installed in 
the G12. No other IHKA options are available at the start of production.

2. Cooling Circuit 

2.1. Overview 

The engines coolant circuit is used to heat the vehicle interior. The lines are routed differently 
depending on the engine version. On all models the coolant lines together with the refrigerant lines 
are always routed on the left-hand side of the vehicle through the bulkhead into the vehicle interior.

3.2. A/C compressor 

The air conditioning compressor has been technically revised and its performance has been 
optimized. 


3.3. Evaporator with Accumulator 

The automatic engine start-stop function (MSA) can be used to switch off the engine. In this case, no 
refrigerant is delivered to the evaporator. As a result, only limited cooling capacity is available to cool 
the vehicle interior. If the vehicle is at a standstill for an extended period of time, the engine needs to be 
restarted in order to cool the interior. This counteracts the Efficient Dynamics measures and increases 
fuel consumption. 

An accumulator evaporator is used. It is installed upstream of the air-conditioning evaporator and has 
the same concept as on the FI 0. The accumulator evaporator is filled with a latent substance that can 
absorb and store cooling energy very effectively. The cold air flowing past in normal operation charges 
the accumulator evaporator and can almost double its capacity.

3.4. Refrigerant lines (inner heat exchanger - IWT) 

A new component is being used in the G12 refrigerant circuit: the inner heat exchanger (IWT). This 
special pipe-in-pipe system uses the refrigerant exiting the evaporator (with a temperature of approx. 
5° C / 41 ° F) to cool down the previously condensed refrigerant from the air conditioning condenser 
from approx. 55° C /131 ° F to approx. 45°C /113° F. This increases the evaporator performance 
and reduces the circulating flow of refrigerant with the same cooling power. As a result, the power 
consumption of the air conditioning compressor is reduced, which lowers fuel consumption. 

The heat input into the refrigerant flowing to the compressor causes the refrigerant to completely 
evaporate. This prevents liquid refrigerant that is carried along from entering the air conditioning 
compressor.

For the G12 740i with the engine version B58, a coolant-cooled air conditioning condenser is being 
used for the first time. The previous air conditioning condenser in the radiator assembly is no longer 
used. The low-temperature circuit for the turbocharger intercooler is also used for the air conditioning 
condenser circuit (via a coolant/refrigerant heat exchanger). An electric coolant pump adjusts the 
requested cooling power from the air conditioning system and combustion engine.

4.1.2.4-zone IHKAcontrol panel 

The 4-zone IHKA operating concept features a full- color display IHKA. The bottom of the display 
between the two temperature selector wheels now features a touch panel for the first time. The 
amount of air for the driver/front passenger as well as the seat heating/active seat ventilation and 
the air freshener can be adjusted using touch control. To do so, users must touch the symbol on the 
display. As soon as the touch panel detects that a user has touched the screen, an information page 
appears on the central information display (CID) with information about the desired setting for the 
operator. This page disappears automatically after a few seconds. 

On the 4-zone IHKA, the current settings of the driver for temperature, amount of air and air 
distribution can be transferred to the passenger's side and the rear passenger compartment by 
pressing the SYNC button.

4.1.3. Layering 

In conjunction with the 4-zone IHKA, a touch-sensitive touch panel for adjusting the stratification has 
been installed for the first time underneath the center vent for the temperature stratification (separate 
for the driver/front passenger). To adjust, users can slide their finger or touch the panel at the desired 
position. The index then jumps directly to the position that the user has touched. The third option is 
to touch the respective end position (blue or red). The index then jumps one level in the respective 
direction. As soon as the system detects that a user has touched the panel, this is shown accordingly 
on the central information display (CID).

4.1.5. Touch Command 

The new Touch Command operating element (optional equipment 6U9) is being used in the G12 
for the first time. The removable tablet PC not only replaces the rear passenger compartment Drive 
controller, it also provides additional functions. All settings and functions of the IHKA control panel for 
the rear passenger compartment can also be configured/activated with the Touch Command. Further 
information on Touch Command can be found in the Training Reference Manual" G12 Display and 
Operating Elements". 



4.1.6. Air treatment 

Air freshener 

The Ambient Air Package optional equipment (OE 4NM) includes an air freshener and an ionizer. 

The air freshener enhances the vehicle interior with one of 4 selectable fragrances, each of which 
is available in 2 intensity levels. 2 of these 4 selectable cartridges can be placed together in a small 
extendable storage compartment in the glove box on the passenger's side. Customers can then 
decide between one of the two fragrances provided. It is only possible to select the available fragrance 
cartridges on the central information display (CID) using the Drive controller. An intensity level from 1 
to 3 can be selected by the menu on the central information display (CID) or using the button on the air 
conditioning control panel. If the user activates the air freshener the information window automatically 
appears on the central information display (CID). It is not possible to mix the two fragrances.

G12 air freshener graphic on CID 


The selected fragrance enhances the vehicle interior in pulses at defined intervals according to the 
configured intensity level. This is because a person's sense of smell adjusts to a given scent relatively 
quickly and then no longer perceives it. When stepping into the vehicle, a "welcome scenario" is 
activated depending on the settings of the personalized ignition key (Key Memory). Depending on the 
setting for the intensity level, a separate fan installed in the air freshener unit then directs air through 
the cartridge every 90 s - 5 min, which is supplied to the vehicle interior. The enhanced air is only 
directed into the vehicle interior at one central point at the top of the instrument panel. To facilitate this, 
it must be ensured that the vehicle interior is indirectly ventilated. If the air freshener is deactivated on 
the central information display (CID), the integrated fan in the air freshener unit continues running for 
approx. 30 s to purge the system.

G12 fragrance cartridge 


The fragrance cartridges manufactured by Mahle are available from BMW Parts and have a shelf life 
of up to 2.5 years. With average consumption the cartridges will last approx. 3-6 months before they 
need to be replaced. Empty fragrance cartridges can be disposed of with household waste. Every 
cartridge is equipped with a SIM card that provides information on the fragrance, filling level and age of 
the cartridge by the LIN-bus. The lid on the cartridge, which seals the cartridge using a rubber seal on 
the housing, prevents the fragrance from escaping while the cartridge is in storage. The cartridge lid is 
pushed on and needs to be removed before inserting the cartridge into the air freshener unit. The lid 
can be slid back on to the rear side of the cartridge, but this is not required to insert the cartridge into 
the air freshener unit, its only for storing the lid for future use.

The following list provides an overview of the available fragrances and whether they are mild or strong. 
The fragrances labelled with No. 1 are milder than those labelled with No. 2. Each vehicle with the 
relevant Air Package equipment (optional equipment 4NM) is supplied with a starter kit of 4 fragrances. 

The following fragrances are available in No.1 (mild) or No. 2 (rich): 

• Blue Suite 1 light 

• Green Suite 1 light 

• Golden Suite 2 rich 

• Authentic Suite 2 rich 


Ionizer 

The ionizer in the G12 has little in common with the system from the F01/F02. The ionizer installed in 
the F01/F02 only functions if there are no occupants in the vehicle and the vehicle is locked. The new 
system in the G12 always functions when the vehicle is in use and the system is not switched off on 
the central information display (CID). 

The ionizer is responsible for bringing negatively charged air ions into the vehicle interior. The aim is 
to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms in the air, such as germs and allergens. Dirt particles in the air 
flowing past become heavier as a result of the adhesion of the negative ions and the bonding into 
a molecule, and sink to the bottom.

G12 ionizer 


The emitters that are installed in the air ducts of the central vents are operated using a high-voltage 
discharge of approx. 2000-3000 V. However, the current applied for this lies within the microampere 
range of 0.53 pA and is therefore non-hazardous. Only negatively charged air ions are generated as 
a result of the air flowing past the emitters. These can bind more oxygen, which contributes to an 
improved sense of wellbeing and higher concentration.

The ionizer control unit is installed on the heating and air-conditioning unit near the IHKA control unit. 

3 electrical connections are provided on the control unit. One three-pin connection is responsible for 
LIN-bus communication and the supply voltage. The other two connections are two-pin and supply 
the necessary high voltage to the emitters in the air ducts. The main control unit that controls the 
ionizer is the IHKA. The system has diagnostic capability and runs a self-test when starting by applying 
high voltage to the emitters. If the system fails to apply high voltage to the emitters three times, the 
system switches off and a fault message appears on the central information display (CID).
