Comfort Area: Control Display and Controller 


Introduction 

Improved display systems and digital technology enable new control functions and dis¬ 
play options. In addition, the number of vehicle functions is increasing. This growth is 
likely to be concentrated in the area of convenience and communication functions such 
as multimedia applications and information services. 



In order to be able to make use this abundance of functions without having an unman¬ 
ageable array of controls and displays, the following concept has been developed: 

1. Combination of user interfaces into a single multifunctional display in the form of 
the Control Display offering centralized screen-based control of functions. 

2. Screen-based control of functions performed by means of a central operating 
control in the form of the Controller. 

The Control Display and the Controller set new standards in driver-vehicle interface 
design. 

This is a logical progression from the On-Board Monitor first introduced on the E38. 

The most important characteristics of the centralized control and display system are the 
following: 

• Standardized layout for all functions 

• Standardized control strategy for all functions 

• High-guality visualization and ergonomics 

• Possibility for easy modification of user interface by software update 


3 

E65 Drive - Comfort Area 




The fundamental component of the Comfort Area is the Control Display and its associat¬ 
ed operating control, the Controller. 

The Control Display is built into the center of the dashboard. The Controller is on the 
center console, positioned ergonomicly in front of the center armrest. 

All convenience functions are within easy reach of the driver and front passenger. 

The following controls are in the Comfort Area: 

• Control Display and Controller. 

• Air conditioning control panel incorporating switches for hazard warning lights and 
central locking. 

• Control panel for radio and compact disc (optional cassette) player. 

• Telecommander (retractable telephone key pad).

Components 

Control Display 

The Control Display consists of: 

1. Metal casing with integral electronic module 

2. LCD display 

3. Hood with glass cover. 



5 

E65 Drive - Comfort Area 















A 16-bit processor is responsible for communication (gateway function) between the 
MOST and K-CAN SYSTEM bus systems, it also performs the tasks of diagnosis pro¬ 
cessing and illumination dimming. 

A 32-bit processor with 16 MB of RAM and a 16 MB graphics memory is responsible for 
display output and user guidance. 

The Control Display is equipped with a Flash memory module. This means that software 
can be downloaded/updated via the diagnosis interface at any time. 

The text and character sets for the language-specific elements of the user interface 
(country coded) are stored in the Flash memory. 

The size of the LCD display is 8.8 inches (diagonal). The complete Control Display 
assembly is attached to the dashboard by three screws. The LCD display plus the hood 
and glass cover are removable, this means that if the glass cover becomes scratched the 
LCD display and hood can be replaced separately. 

The LCD display plus hood clips onto the metal casing. A special tool is required to sep¬ 
arate the two components. Internally, the LCD display is connected to the electronic 
module by a ribbon cable. 

On the rear of the metal casing there are cooling fins. Next to them is a 5-amp fuse, this 
protects the Control Display against damage from excessive current. 

Brightness Control 

There is a photo-cell on the front of the LCD to the right of the screen for detecting the 
ambient light so that the screen brightness can be adjusted accordingly. 

The screen brightness also responds to manual adjustment of the instrument lighting 
dimmer control.

D-BUS 



K-CAN P K-CAN S MOST byiefHght PT-CAN 

The Control Display communicates via the MOST bus system with all other components 
on the MOST bus. 

The Control Display is the system master for the MOST bus. The system master holds 
the knowledge of the complete system and links up the individual modules into a sys¬ 
tem. 

The Control Display also performs the function of power master within the MOST net¬ 
work. 

That means that the Control Display wakes up all MOST nodes (control units). They then 
register with the Audio System Controller (= connection master, control function for 
establishing connection). 

Once all nodes (MOST control units) have registered as awake, a message to that effect 
is sent to the Control Display by the ASK. 

The Control Display is also responsible for sending the MOST nodes to sleep. The 
MOST bus is networked to the remaining bus systems via the K-CAN SYSTEM. 

The Control Display contains the gateway module, MOST-CAN Gateway (MCGW) to 
function as an interface between the MOST and K-CAN-S busses. 

The instrument cluster is an exception. It has a separate connection to the K-CAN S. 

The Controller is connected by the K-CAN S via the Center Console Control Center 
module (BZM) to the Control Display. 

The diagnosis interface for the Control Display is the ZGM via the diagnosis bus. 


7 

E65 Drive - Comfort Area 






































































































Connectors 

The Control Display has a 14-pin (1) 
and a 12-pin (2) connector. 

The 14-pin connector incorporates the 
connections for the MOST (fiber-optic) 
and K-CAN-System bus systems. 

The 12-pin connector provides the 
RGB-format (RGB = red, green, blue) 
video input. 

The Control Display is capable of digi¬ 
tizing analog video signals and display¬ 
ing them on the LCD screen in full¬ 
screen or split-screen mode. 

Controller 

The Controller is an evolution of the rotary push button used on the previous On-Board 
Monitors. 

It is the central operating control for all convenience functions and selected options for 
vehicle functions. The Controller is located in the most comfortable and ergonomic posi¬ 
tion for the user (driver or front passenger). 

It is on the front portion of the armrest between the driver and front passenger seats. 




8 

E65 Drive - Comfort Area 









Continued development of the practice-proven rotary push button principle has provided 
the Controller with an additional linear movement capability in the horizontal plane. 

The Controller can be moved horizontally from its resting position (center position), to 
which it always returns when released. 

The 8 main menus around the edge of the Control Display are arranged in a pattern 
resembling the points of a compass. There are 8 main directions in which the Controller 
is moved in the horizontal plane in order to select the main menus. 



The 8 main directions of movement of the Controller are scanned by a switch unit. That 
switch unit consists of 8 individual switches. They are positioned at 45 degrees to each 
other. 

If the Controller is moved to one of the main menus (option panels) and released at that 
point/moved back to its center position, the selected menu opens. 


9 

E65 Drive - Comfort Area 














Generation of Touch Sensitive Feedback 

Since there are a wide variety of ways in which the Controller can be held and moved, 
only the key movements are signalled to the user by touch sensitive feedback (simulated 
dial clicks). 


The positions/movements for which there is feedback are: 

• Center position 

• 8 main directions of movement in horizontal plane 

• Clockwise/anti-clockwise rotation (with incremental divisions for selection function) 

• Depressed position (confirmation function) 


The touch sensitive feedback for the center position, the main horizontal directions of 
movement and the depressed position are created mechanically. Only the feedback for 
the rotation movement is generated electrically. 

When the Controller is rotated in a control menu it provides touch sensitive feedback for 
the user. This is for the purpose of simulating the familiar mechanical stops of a conven¬ 
tional rotary control knob. 

When items on the Control Display screen are selected, there is a difference between the 
strength of the feedback for different items such as lists, function buttons, screen areas 
and end stops. This difference is used as a method of confirmation so that changes in 
the Control Display can be made with a minimal amount of visual distraction. 

When the Control Display is switched off, the controller rotates freely without any incre¬ 
mental stops. 

Inside the Controller there is a DC motor which is controlled by pulse-width modulation 
(PWM) signals. That motor generates a rotational force opposite to the direction of rota¬ 
tion. That opposing force or torque is perceived by the user as a mechanical resistance.

Help 



The basic menu always remains behind the currently selected menu as a ninth menu and 
can be recalled by moving the Controller in the direction of the active main menu. 

Pressing the Controller when the basic menu is active switches off the Control Display. 
However, the bottom status bar showing the status of the air conditioning, entertainment 
system, time and date remains visible! 

When the Control Display is switched off, pressing the Controller or moving it horizontally 
switches the Control Display on. 

If the Controller is moved in the direction of one of the main menus, this not only switches 
the Control Display on, it also opens the menu that is located in that direction. 

The following actions also cause the Control Display to switch on: 

• Display of a priority 1 message box, e.g. a check control message such as "Engine 
oil pressure too low" 

• Operation of the PDC (Park Distance Control). 

• An incoming/outgoing telephone call or operation of the Send/ End button on the 
MFL/Telecommander 

• Operating the audio system in KL 30. 


17 

E65 Drive - Comfort Area 




Help System 

There is a help system for using the Control Display. It is activated by moving the 
Controller towards the bottom right ("south east") to the "Help" menu. 

The help is in the form of short text information. The help provides explanations of the 
selected menu options. When the help is activated, context-related explanations appear 
on the assistance screen according to the position of the highlighted function.

The button for the selected menu is visually highlighted and the menu name displayed in 
the control area. This applies only if the function Menu Name has been activated in the 
Help system or if the Controller is held in the deflected position for more than 1 second. 

Releasing the Controller or returning it to the center position starts the menu selection 
and it is then displayed on the Control Display. 

If the wrong menu is selected by accident (e.g. "BMW ASSIST" instead of "Climate"), this 
is easily corrected. Since the movement of the Controller is not restricted by a rigid 
"gate", the individual menus can be selected successively by moving the Controller 
around in a circle. 

If the Controller is in the center position, the menu corresponding to the last direction it 
was moved in is displayed. 

Additional information from other functions such as On-Board Computer or Help (as in 
the example shown) can be displayed simultaneously on the assistance screen. 

The following pages contain a summary of the remaining menus in clockwise order with 
details of the screen displays for the first page of each menu. 

More detailed information about those menus and the functions they offer can 
be found in the relevant information chapters and of course, in the Owners 
Manual.

E65 Drive - Comfort Area 




Climate 

The various pages of the “Climate” menu 
contain the following functions: 

• Vent position selection 

• Center vent stratification 

• Customization of air volume distribution 

• Parked car ventilation settings 

• Seat heating proportioning (seat bot¬ 
tom/seat back) 

Certain selected climate control settings such as air volume are both available from the 
Control Display as well as the IHKA control panel. 

If a menu has has more than one page, this is indicated by a button in the bottom left 
corner. The button is selected rotating the Controller and the selection confirmed by 
depressing the Controller. 



The next menu page then appears. 

To return to the previous page select the button again.

Workshop Hints 


Service Mode 

The Controller can be used to gain access to Service mode functions of the Control 
Display. 

Service mode is a special function that provides information about the status of the dis¬ 
play and MOST system. 

It is designed for use by Service Technicians and is not intended to be accessible to vehi¬ 
cle owners. 

Service mode provides access to details of the hardware/ software versions for the control 
display and the control units in the MOST network. 

As an addition to the Test Modules of the Diagnosis Program, Service mode is a simple 
means of quickly accessing control module data without the need for a diagnosis tester. 

Starting the service mode is somewhat like opening a safe: 

• In the Basic menu display, press down the Controller for approximately 6 seconds. 
This step initializes the tactile feedback of the motor. (Hint: The help text flashes 
briefly when it is ready). 

• Turn Controller 3 increments clockwise (to the right). 

• Turn Controller 3 increments anti-clockwise (to the left). 

• Turn Controller 1 increment clockwise (right). 

• Turn Controller 1 increment anti-clockwise (left). 

• Turn Controller 1 increment clockwise (right). 

• Depress Controller to confirm.

The Control Display knows how many MOST nodes there are, i.e. how many MOST 
nodes there are on the MOST ring bus. When retrieving the list of MOST control units 
fitted, the Control Display waits for a response from each MOST node. Every control unit 
on the MOST bus contains a MOST communication chip.

“Back” button 


The navigation system control unit has two internal MOST nodes. The query which pro¬ 
duces the list of MOST control units is answered by only one of the MOST nodes in the 
navigation system control unit. 

The responding MOST node is represented as "Navigation" and the other MOST node 
as "wait." This entry is not an error. 

The function "MOST devices" provides a list of all nodes on the MOST network. 

When a control unit is selected, a scrollable list containing the following information 
appears: 

• Part number • Hardware number 

• Coding Index • Diagnosis index 

• Variant index • Date of Manufacture 

• Manufacturer number • Message catalog version 

• Software version • Operating system version
