Components 


Light Module (LM) 

The Light Module (LM) controls and monitors all of the exterior lights as well as control¬ 
ling the LWR headlight aiming function. It is also the dimmer master for instrument and 
panel lighting and includes emergency functions in case of malfunction. 


Light Module 



The Light Module is connected to the K-CAN-S for communication with the Rain Light 
Sensor (RLS) and the rest of the vehicle including diagnosis. 

The LM has one 76 pin connector (XI2). The case is ventilated to dissipate heat from 
the final stage semi-conductors. 

The light module is located below the drivers side of the instrument panel, to the left of 
the steering column and behind the sheet metal support for the dashboard. 


To remove the module it is not necessary to remove the drivers side knee airbag. 


Light Module location

Light Switch 


The light switch is located to the left of the 
steering column. It is a single component 
and includes the following controls: 

• Rotary knob light switch (including 
Automatic position). 

• Fog light push button. 



• Dimmer potentiometer thumb wheel. 


• Button for EMF (parking brake). 

• Button for opening trunk (TOEHKI). 

he switches for trunk opening and EMF 
are interpreted separately by their respec¬ 
tive control units. 

The light switch uses a 5 volt reference 
supplied by the LM and provides the posi¬ 
tion of the rotary knob light switch over two 
wires. 

When the switch is open, the LM reads 5V. 
When the switch is closed, the LM reads 
2.5V. A value of over 6.75 volts represents 
a fault and activates the emergency opera¬ 
tion of the LM. 

Interpretation of the 4 light switch positions 
is based on the switch logic over the two 
wires.

1 = switch closed 
0 = switch open 

The foglight switch is similarly interpreted 
as a high low signal over its own wire.

Brake Light Switch 

Similar to previous models an electronic 
brake-light switch (Hall-sensor) is used. 

It is powered from KL R ON. Its signal is 
provided as an analog input. 

The brake switch has a level of 0 volts in 
the non-actuated state and approx. 8-9 
volts when the brake is depressed 
(dependent on the system voltage). 

Fault Detection 

There are two different fault scenarios for 
the brake-light switch: short circuit to 
ground and open circuit. 

Short circuits to ground can only be safely detected with terminal R OFF. If a low level is 
detected instead of the anticipated high, there is a short circuit and the brake-light switch 
is determined to be faulty. This self-diagnosis is only performed after entry into power¬ 
down mode so long as no light function is activated while the K-CAN-S bus is inactive. 

A possible open circuit is not electrically distinguishable from an actuated brake. With 
terminal 15 ON and information on brake pressure (DSC - PT-CAN - ZGM - K-CAN-S - 
LM) but no detected brake-light-switch actuation, the brake-light switch is also con¬ 
demned as faulty. The fault entry "Brake-light switch faulty" is made in both cases. 

Limp-Home Functions 

The function of the brake light is assured even when the LM is in limp-home mode. 
Internal circuitry connects the brake-light-switch output directly to the lamp drivers. The 
function rules out the possibility of PWM operation. 

Hazard-Warning Button 

The hazard-warning button has a level of approx. 4.7 volts in the "hazard-warning button 
not pressed" state and 0 volts in the "hazard-warning button pressed" state. 

The hazard-warning button is located in the IHKA control panel and is a direct input to 
the LM.

E65 Lighting Systems 



Steering Column Turn Signal and High Beam Stalk 

Driver request signals from the steering col¬ 
umn stalk are received by the LM as K-CAN- 
S messages. In the event of a bus fault, the 
signals are interpreted as analog values over a 
separate input line. The following functions 
are evaluated as CAN messages: 

1) Single-touch flashing, left or right 

2) Continuous flashing, left or right 

3) High beam on 

4) High beam off or headlight flasher 

The command for cancelling of the turn signals comes from the steering angle 
sensor of the SZL.

Fault Detection 

If no K-CAN messages are received from the steering-column stalk for a period exceed¬ 
ing 20s, the stalk is determined to be faulty. K-CAN communication continues to be 
attempted, although the light functions are then determined by the analog data line input. 
The fault status is terminated by newly detected K-CAN communication. 


The following functions are determined as analog values over the data line in the event 
of a fault: 


1) High mode on/off or headlight flasher 

2) One-touch flashing, left/right 

3) Neutral position

Rain/Light Sensor 

The Rain/Light Sensor is attached to the windshield. It records: 

• The rain intensity for controlling the wiper intervals. 

• The surrounding and frontal brightness for controlling "automatic-light control". 
Two additional optical sensors are evaluated in the RLS.

If there is a switch-on requirement, this is transmitted by a K-CAN message to the 
Light Module. 

If the rotary knob light switch is in the "automatic light control" position, the headlights 
lights are activated and an LED on the light switch is switched on. 

LWR Ride Height Level Sensors 

The E65 headlight system also includes headlight vertical aim control (LWR). This sys¬ 
tem is very similar to the LRA function incorporated into the LSZ of the E46. 

The servo-motor for control of vertical adjustment of the headlight is controlled directly 
by the Light Module. 

Similar to the E38, angle-hall sensors (1) used to detect changes in vehicle loading are 
mounted on the front and rear right side axles.

Exterior Lighting Components 

The external lighting system consists of the following components: 

• Front headlight assemblies (parking, Low beam, high beam, turn indicators) 

• Fog lights 

• Tail light assemblies (tail light, brake lights, turn indicators, reverse lights and 
license plate lights) 


Front Headlight Assemblies 

The new headlights with integral turn indi¬ 
cators are in the BMW tradition of being 
four round lights. The turn signal indica¬ 
tors are now above the lights, giving them 
the appearance of “eye brows”. 

The E65 is equipped with new “Bi-Xenon” 
lamps as standard equipment. The 
inboard lamps are conventional halogen 
bulbs. 

A sidemarker (U.S. version) is integrated 
into the turn signal indicator. 

The parking light is an optical-wave guide 
ring around each high-beam and low- 
beam headlight, similar to the 2001 E39. 

The headlight assemblies are a sealed 
integral unit. The replacement of the bi¬ 
xenon bulb and the control unit require 
that the headlight assembly be removed 
from the vehicle. 

All other bulbs can be replaced without 
removing the headlights. 

In order to remove the front headlight 
assemblies, the front bumper must first 
be removed.

6. Servomotor for LWR (Headlight vertical aim control) 


There are holes for easy access to the screws for height adjustment and lateral adjust¬ 
ment of the low-beam and high-beam headlights. 

The outer adjusting screw (1) is for lateral adjustment of both lights. The inner adjusting 
screw (2) is for vertical adjustment of the high-beam and low-beam headlights. 


Bi-Xenon Lights 

“Bi-xenon” means that the xenon lights can be switched over from low-beam to 
high-beam. 

When the low beams are “on”, the lower part of the light beam is blocked by a shutter 
that is directly in front of the reflector. 


When high beams are switched “on”, an electro-magnet is energized by the LM. The 
electro-magnet “flips” the shutter open, allowing the entire beam of light generated by 
the xenon bulb to be part of the high-beam. 



Low beam: Shutter vertical 


High beam: Shutter opened

Fog Lights 

The fog lights of the E65 are small ellipsoid lights 
similar to the E39. 

A single screw secures each fog light in position. 
The snap-fit horizontal grille insert has to be 
removed in order to gain access to this screw. The 
screw for vertical adjustment is freely accessible. 
The fog light has to be removed in order for the 
bulb to be replaced. 




Tail Light Assemblies 

The rear light assemblies are integrated into the rear guarter panels and into the luggage 
compartment lid. 

The tail light, brake light and turn indicator lights are located in the rear quarter panels. 

An additional tail light is integrated into the luggage compartment lid, along with the rear 
fog light, reverse light and license plate light. 

Tail lights and brake lights are 3D brilliant type (light sources are LED illuminated). 

The third brake light below the rear shelf is also an LED assembly that can only be 
replaced as a complete unit.

2. Brake light 

3. Direction indicator 

4. Tail light 

5. Rear fog light 

6. Reverse light 



13 

E65 Lighting Systems 























Incandescent bulbs are used for the turn indicators 
(2). The brake lights and tail lights are lit by LEDs. 

In the U.S. version, the tail lights light up along with 
the brake lights when the brakes are applied. 

If a tail light or brake light fails, the entire rear light 
assembly has to be removed so that the LED con¬ 
troller (1) can be replaced. 

A three-part light assembly is integrated into the lug¬ 
gage compartment lid. 



These three lights are secured to the rear lid trim 
panel on the luggage compartment lid by screws. 



1. Tail light/rear fog light 

2. Plastic rear trim panel 

3. Center light group: 

Reverse lights and 
license plate lights 


There is a non-reflective design area between the two reversing lights. 

The reverse lights, the rear fog lights and the license plate lights all have incandescent 
bulbs, whereas the tail lights, like those in the side panels, are LED lights. 

The interior trim of the luggage compartment lid behind the light clusters has to be 
removed to replace the bulbs.

Principle of Operation 

The following tasks are performed by the Light Module (LM): 

• Control and monitoring exterior vehicle headlights and lamps. 

• Function of dimmer for instrument and control panel lighting (KL 58 g). 

• Automatic Driving-Light Control (FLC). 

• Control of the headlight-vertical aim control system (LWR) with dynamic control. 

• Internal power management (sleep mode.) 

• Emergency functions. 

• Redundant data storage. 

Lamp Control and Monitoring 
Power Limitation 

In order to increase their service life, the incandescent vehicle lamps are activated using 
PWM once the system voltage rises above a coded value. 

Any further increase in the system voltage results in constant voltage operation not to 
exceed 13.5 volts. 

Dynamic PWM Correction 

The short-term peak loads of the Valvetronic unit create voltage dips in the vehicle elec¬ 
trical system, which in turn can result in fluctuations in the vehicle lighting. In order to 
reduce this effect, the LM incorporates adapted measures which compensate for this by 
performing a fast PWM correction. 

Bulb Monitoring 

All bulbs with the exception of the LED brake/tail lights and the xenon headlights are cold 
monitored. The LEDs and bi-xenon lights are warm monitored along with the rest of the 
bulbs. 

The LM signals the instrument cluster if a bulb has failed so that it can display a 
Check Control warning to the driver. 

See the E65 Instrument Cluster module of the Drive chapter for detailed descriptions 
of the CC warning messages.

Brake Force Display 

As an indication of heavy vehicle braking or when the ABS is in regulation, the tail lights 
lights mounted on the luggage compartment lid illuminate at the same intensity as the 
brake lights. 


It is activated by the LM recognizing a rapid change in acceleration and ABS operation.

Automatic Driving Light Control (FLC) 

Automatic Driving Light Control is a new function 
that is controlled by the LM. 

In order to operate the system, the rotary knob light 
switch must be placed in the automatic position. An 
LED illuminates on the switch to indicate that the 
system is on. 


FLC Position (Automatic) 



The Rain/Light Sensor detects the surrounding and 
frontal brightness using two phototransistors. 


i 



1. The surrounding-light sensor records the 
light intensity in a wide angle above the 
vehicle. 

2. The frontal-light sensor records the light 
intensity in a narrow angle in front of the 
vehicle. 


16 

E65 Lighting Systems 








An internal processor calculates from the measured data if a switch-on situation 
is needed. 

The following switch-on situations can be detected: 

• Dawn/dusk 

• Darkness 

• Driving into an underground car park 

• Driving through a tunnel 

• Precipitation such as rain or snow 

If a switch-on situation is needed, this is communicated to the Light Module 
(via the K-CAN-S bus). 

Headlight Vertical Aim Control (LWR) 

Headlight Vertical Aim control is used to adapt the position of the headlights automatical¬ 
ly to the vehicle load condition. 

Headlight Vertical Aim Control has the following features: 

• 1 stepper motor for each left and right headlight assembly. 

• Activation of stepper motors in parallel on left and right sides (common driver 1C). 

• Possibility of diagnosing missing connections to stepper motors (line break) and 
short circuits in windings (motor fault). 

Referencing of Stepper Motors 

The position of the stepper motors is initially uncertain after LWR is activated. First of all, 
a reference run is carried out which takes place in two phases for the purpose of improv¬ 
ing accuracy. The object of the reference run is to guarantee a fixed initial position (cali¬ 
bration) for the headlights. 

Automatic Setpoint Generation 

Automatic LWR derives the setpoint for the headlight range from two ride-level sensors. 
These sensors are mounted on the front and rear axles. They are used to determine the 
difference in ride height between the front and rear axles. 

The input signals (0.3 - 4.7 V) of the ride-level sensors are measured with the engine 
running or lights ON cyclically at intervals of 20 ms. Voltage values < 0.3 V and > 4.7 V 
are interpreted as faults. The LM registers a fault entry "Sensor, ride level, front, faulty" or 
"Sensor, ride level, rear, faulty". 


17 

E65 Lighting Systems 




Dynamic Headlight Vertical Aim Control 

The effect of dynamic LWR, is that the headlight aim is corrected immediately in critical 
driving situations (extreme braking; heavy acceleration). 

In this way, reduced headlight aim under certain circumstances (e.g. during braking) is 
immediately corrected by the process of the head lights being "raised". 

Also, the dazzling of other road users is eliminated during acceleration by the process of 
the headlights being "lowered". 

The problem of incorrect interpretations (e.g. irregular road surface) is avoided by the use 
of more signals than just the ride-level signals. 

It can usually be assumed that a braking operation is always accompanied by a simulta¬ 
neously actuated brake-light switch. However, the brake-light switch is not actuated dur¬ 
ing acceleration. The vehicle speed is included in the correction calculation. 

Dynamic Compensation During Braking 

Because of the "system knowledge" that compensation of the headlight aim during brak¬ 
ing is particularly more important when braking at high speeds, dynamic LWR can damp¬ 
en compensation of the headlight aim at low speeds. 

Dynamic compensation during braking begins "gradually" above the minimum speed of 
approx. 40 km/h (25mph) and reaches its full effect from a speed of approx. 80 km/h 
(50mph). 

As long as the brake light switch is not actuated, there is no dynamic compensation for 
braking. 

Dynamic Compensation During Acceleration 

Acceleration is more "probable" the lower the initial speed is. Absolute accelerating per¬ 
formance decreases as speed increases because the vehicle is being driven in higher 
gears and therefore less torque is available. 

Complete dynamic compensation takes place during acceleration as long as the speed is 
less than approx. 50 km/h (31 mph). The effect of dynamic compensation decreases 
increasingly above this speed and disappears from a speed of approx. 110 km/h (68mph). 

When the brake light switch is actuated, there is no dynamic compensation for accelera¬ 
tion. 


18 

E65 Lighting Systems 



Activation of Stepper Motors 

Functions of the software driver for activating the stepper motors: 

• Positioning of stepping motors (powering, acceleration and deceleration). 

• Carrying out a reference run (each time LWR is activated). 

• Inclusion of current actual step counter. 

• Setpoint/actual-value comparison of step position. 

• Activation of stepping-motor driver. 

Internal Power Management (Sleep Mode) 

Because the LM's operating current consumption would place unwanted load on the 
vehicle battery during long periods of parking and when its functions are not needed, it is 
provided with mechanisms for identifying out-of-service periods and reducing the power 
requirement while retaining wake-up readiness. 

The micro-processor of the LM functions with nominal operating current when: 

• The CAN is active 

• Terminal R (input) is active 

• Terminal 15 (input) is active 

• Lamp functions are active 

• Anti-theft alarm-system alarm is active 

• The follow-me-home light circuit is active 

If none of the above conditions apply, the LM transmits it’s sleep readiness and then 
switches into sleep mode. It also switches into this mode when the sleep conditions 
are in place and the sleep acknowledge bit has been received from another bus user. 

After approx. 30 seconds the current consumption drops from approx. 120 mA to below 
1 mA. The LM awakens cyclically and input signals are monitored so that the system can 
respond to possible changes in the switch states and the external inputs. 

A CAN telegram received during this power-saving mode results in system wake-up. 
Following a wake-up period of max. 100 ms, the LM is again ready for communication, 
relevant telegrams are fully received and evaluated in each case so that no bus informa¬ 
tion is lost. 


19 

E65 Lighting Systems 





If no wake-up condition occurs for a period exceeding 390 s, the switch inputs are no 
longer monitored and the zero-signal current is reduced further. 

System wake-up is possible by CAN telegrams, an activated terminal 15 or the hazard¬ 
warning button. 

Redundant Data Storage 

The LM shares responsibility with the CAS for the storage of the Vehicle Identification 
Number and the FA (Vehicle Order). 

Emergency Functions 

The system is equipped with hardware that is completely independent from the proces¬ 
sor in order to safeguard the functions needed for driving safety should the processor or 
one of its elements malfunction. 

Emergency operation provides the following functions: 

With terminal 15 ON, the following components are activated regardless of the position of 
the light switch: 

• Low-beam headlights, left and right 

• Rear lamps/brake lights, left and right (outer) 

With terminal 15 ON and actuated brake-light switch: 

• Brake lights, left and right 

Turn-signal and hazard-warning flashers, high beam, headlight flasher, front fog lamps, 
rear fog light and the 3rd brake light cannot be activated. Communication via K-CAN-S is 
not possible.

Components 

The interior lighting includes the following lights: 

External Door Handle Lighting (Visual Entry Aid) 

A "central light source" module with a lamp is located in each of the doors. With the aid 
of an optical fiber conductor, this module illuminates the entrance area of the vehicle and 
also lights up the exterior door handles. 



The central light sources are controlled by the individual door modules. 

The door modules communicate with the PM via the K-CAN-P for instructions when to 
activate and deactivate the light source module. 

The CAS provides door opening, remote control operation and terminal status to both 
the PM and door modules. 

Interior Lights 

A total of seven interior lights are provided: at the door entrance (all four doors), in the 
front right and left footwell as well as in the glove compartment. 

The door entrance lights are controlled by the respective door modules. The footwell 
lighting is controlled by the IB circuit and the glove box light by the VA-K circuit of the 
Power Module.

Front Interior Light Roof Console 

The interior light (2), two separately controlled 
reading lights on the right and left (3) as well 
as two LEDs for ambient lighting (1) are con¬ 
tained in the front light unit. 

The interior light is controlled by the IB circuit 
and the reading lights are part of the VA-D cir¬ 
cuit of the Power Module. 

The contact for turning on and off the interior 
light is a momentary contact to the Power 
Module. The operation is the same as previ¬ 
ous models including the “workshop mode” 
(hold for longer than 3 s, lights remain off). 

The ambient lighting LEDs are supplied power 
by the KL-58g circuit of the Light Module. 

Rear Interior Light Roof Console 

An interior light roof console is also provided in 
the rear seating area. 

It also contains an interior light, two separately 
controlled reading lamps on the right and left, 
a make-up mirror with two make-up lights as 
well as two LEDs for ambiance lighting. 

The interior, reading and ambient lighting are 
controlled on the same circuits as the front 
with the exception of the lights for the make¬ 
up mirror which are controlled by the VA-K cir¬ 
cuit. 

DoorTrim Panel Illumination 

The grey decorative strip of the door trim 
panel also houses a fiber optic conductor that 
illuminates the inside door handle and switch 
blocks. 

The light source is provided by a LED and 
controlled by the respective door module after 
receiving the KL58g signal over the K-CAN 
from the LM.

Classroom Exercise - Review Questions 


6. What is the difference between the “VA-D” and “VA-K” circuits? 


7. What information is shared redundantly between the LM and CAS? Also, why 
should these two components not be replaced at the same time? 


8. How many ride height sensors are used for the LWR system and where are they 
located?
