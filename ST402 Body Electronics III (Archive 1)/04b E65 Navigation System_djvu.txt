E65 Navigation System 




Introduction 


The navigation computer of the E65 is the control unit that provides navigation, telemat¬ 
ics and Online services (planned). 



In terms of the functionality, the navigation computer corresponds to the Mk-3 navigation 
computer introduced for model year 2001. A number of additional functions however, 
have been integrated. 

• New, larger screen (8.8 inches) with an 8:3 size ratio. 

• Simultaneous map and arrow presentation modes. 

• Map or arrow presentation in assistance window always possible (simultaneously 
with radio menu, etc.). 

• New-route calculation is faster when the driver has to deviate from the planned 
route. 

• Improved map presentation graphics. 

• Faster on-screen map builds. 

• "Avoiding toll road" as a new routing criteria. 

• Multiple destinations can be grouped in a destinations list and picked up one after 
the other. 

• Route information arrows, distance and name of the next street shown in the 
instrument cluster. 

• Extended voice output ("... follow the 195 interstate"). 

• Direct destination home (also by voice command). 

• Avoiding individual roads or entire roadway sections. 

• Help text explanations for individual menu items. 

Like all information and communication systems, the control unit is connected to the 
MOST bus.

Components 


Navigation Computer (NAV. 01) 

The navigation computer is located in the left rear corner of the luggage compartment. 



Similar to the Mk-3 computer, the E65 NAV. 01 contains: 

• CD drive. 

• Hardware for navigation, telematics and online services function. 

• Transceiver for interface with the MOST network. (Transceiver contains two nodes) 

• Gyro sensor. 

• GPS receiver. 

• Output for RGB (graphics interface) 

• Cooling fan for unit. 

Building maps on the Control Display is now considerably faster than before. This 
improvement was achieved by means of modifications to the hardware. 

The connection to the MOST bus is by a standardized MOST transceiver. The MOST 
transceiver incorporates two interfaces (nodes). 

Each MOST telegram is divided into 3 parts. 

• Control data 

• Asynchronous data (e.g. navigation system, arrow presentation) 

• Synchronous data (e.g. audio, video signals) 

A node can analyze only two signals at a time, this is the reason why two nodes are nec¬ 
essary for the navigation computer. In the Control Display self-test, both nodes are 
shown as control units but only one node can be displayed as a recognized control unit. 
The second node is always displayed as "wait" (normally control unit not recognized).

GPS Antenna 

The antenna for the navigation system is incor¬ 
porated into the shark-fin antenna that is 
mounted on the roof. 

This antenna contains a dual band antenna for 
the telephone as well as the GPS antenna. 

Speed Signal 

The road speed signal is provided directly by 
the DSC. The signal is processed from the left 
front wheel sensor. 

MOST 

The navigation computer is part of the MOST 
network. Like all the control units in the MOST 
system, the navigation computer is woken up 
by light signals on the MOST bus, this means 
that the nav. computer has to be in permanent 
operation. 



Standby current consumption is less than 0.02 mA. 

The data for the route arrows displayed in the instrument cluster and in the Control 
Display is carried on the MOST bus.

Principle of Operation 


Navigation Display 

The information is presented in the Control Display 
and the instrument cluster. The display window in the 
Control Display has been re-sized to a width-to- i 

height ratio of 8:3 (previous wide-screen BM 16:9). 

When Route Guidance (with arrow display selected) 
is active, the navigation display also appears auto¬ 
matically in the instrument cluster. 

Display of the information in the instrument cluster cannot be deactivated while the route 
guidance function is active. 




2. Arrow display in control 
area and map in assis¬ 
tance screen of control

The display of navigation information in the Control Display can be deactivated by select¬ 
ing some other function. 


Map or arrow display in assistance window is always possible (simultaneously with radio 
menu, BC, etc.)

New Functions 


New Route 

New-route calculation is faster when the driver has to deviate from the planned route. 
Instead of recalculating the entire route when the driver deviates from the planned route, 
the computer re-calculates only a section of the route before issuing the next instruction, 
this saves time. 


Avoiding Toll Road 

This is a new selection that has been added to the route-selection menu along with the 
previous: fastest route, main use of highways, least use of highways, etc.). 


Selection of Destination from Stored Memory 

Multiple destinations are stored in a destinations list. To select the current desired route 
from memory, the destination must be selected and placed as number 1.

Display of Navigation Data in the Instrument Cluster 

Route information, distance and the name of the next street can now be shown in the 
instrument cluster providing the driver with navigation data without having to look away 
from the road. 



1. Street name 

2. Distance until 
next turn 

3. Route arrow

Extended Voice Instructions 

The voice instructions have a greater vocabulary thanks to the faster processor and 
greater system memory of the navigation computer, (e.g. “Continue straight ahead fol¬ 
lowing 195”, instead of, “follow the main road”). 


Direct Home Function 

Selecting home is easier by storing it permanently in memory and selecting it from a 
“home” icon in the address book menu or using the Speech Processing System to 
access it.

Avoiding Sections of a Road or Complete Roads 

From the New Route menu individual roads or complete roadways can be barred and the 
navigation computer will develop a new route avoiding those specific roads. This is espe¬ 
cially useful to avoid long term construction sites or roads that are commonly congested 
with traffic.

Classroom Exercise - Review Questions 


,_ • 

1. Where is the antenna for the navigation system located? 


2. How many “nodes” are integrated in to the navigation computer? Why does it 
have that many? How can this affect troubleshooting a MOST bus problem? 


3. How does the navigation computer send display images to the Control Display 
and the instrument cluster?
