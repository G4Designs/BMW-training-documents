E65 Park Distance Control 


Introduction 

The first PDC was introduced by BMW in the U.S. for the E38 in 1995. The PDC of the 
E65 is a further development of the E38 PDC. 

PDC assists the driver when maneuvering into and out of parking spaces. The signal 
tones and a visual display indicate the current distance to an obstacle. 

The new features of the PDC are: 

• Acoustic distance warning using the audio system speakers 

• Visible distance indicator in the Control Display (CD) 

• Check Control messages in the Kombi and CD

Components 


PDC Control Unit 

The PDC Control Unit is located in the right rear corner of the luggage compartment. 



Its main tasks are: 

• Activation of sensors and reception of echo signals. 

• Evaluation of the received echo signals. 

• Activation of the function indicator (LED in the switch). 

• Sending messages via K-CAN-S to ASK and the CD. 

• Monitoring the inputs and outputs. 

• Management of the diagnosis and test functions. 

PDC uses the echo sounding principle to calculate the distances between each of the 
4 sensors in the front and rear bumpers and any obstacle that might be present. 

In addition, a three-way calculation can be used to calculate the effective distance to 
the bumper in the case of an obstacle between two sensors. 

This three-way calculation is enabled by co-sensing of the neighboring sensors. 

An active sensor system in the converter processes the received echo signals, performs 
the evaluation and communicates across a bi-directional data line with the control unit.

Sensors 


The PDC system of the E65 uses 8 sensors in total, 4 in the front bumper and 4 in the 
rear. 

The control unit sends a digital signal to set the ultrasonic sensor either in a combined 
transmit and receive mode or in a receive only mode. 

Combined Mode 

The sensor first transmits a packet of ultrasonic impulses and then receives the echoes 
reflected by the obstacle within its sensing range. 

On the basis of the time span between transmission and reception, the control unit calcu¬ 
lates the distance to the obstacle. 

Receive Only Mode 

The sensor receives the impulses deflected by the neighboring sensors. The evaluation 
of these signals in the control unit improves the certainty of detection of the system. 

The design of the sensor varies from that used until now in that the outer membranes are 
completely round instead of oval. 




The advantages of this new round membrane shape are the greater detection range and 
lower sensitivity in wet conditions. The sensors are always painted in body color.

PDC Button 


The PDC button is to the left of the start/stop button and it consists of the following 
components: 

• Button 

• Function indicator (LED) 

• Location light 

The button can be used to activate or deacti¬ 
vate PDC manually. The locating light is con¬ 
nected to terminal 58g. The function indica¬ 
tor LED is connected to the control unit. 

When the PDC is activated, the LED turns on 
permanently. In the event of an error mes¬ 
sage, it flashes at a freguency of 2 Hz. 

Interfaces 

The communication with the vehicle electronics takes place across the K-CAN S.

Audio System Controller (ASK) 

The acoustic distance warning is output through the front midrange speaker of the audio 
system in the doors and in the rear shelf. The signal tones for all 4 loudspeakers as well 
as their intervals are processed in the ASK and mixed with the current audio output. 

The dedicated speakers used until now are no longer used in the E65. 

Control Display (CD) 

If the “PDC Pic” option is enabled from the “Settings” menu, the visual distance warning 
is displayed in the CD and the graphic is generated in the CD. 

Instrument Cluster 

The instrument cluster is used by the PDC as a display unit for Check Control (CC) mes¬ 
sages. The PDC control unit also receives the outside temperature as well as the 
mileage reading from the instrument cluster. 

Ice and dew can lead to false activations of the ultrasonic sensors. In order to reduce the 
effect of this phenomenon, the response characteristics are adapted via software as of 
+6°C and colder. 

In the case of a fault code entry in the fault memory, the km reading and the outside tem¬ 
perature are also stored. 

Dynamic Stability Control DSC 

The DSC control unit provides the speed signal. 

Adaptive Gearbox Control (AGS) 

The AGS provides the reverse gear signal for automatic activation of the PDC. 

CAR Access System (CAS) 

The CAS reports the terminal status (KLR, KL15, KL50). 

Power Module (PM) 

The PM telegrams the vehicle battery voltage.

Principle of Operation 

Activation of the PDC 

The system is activated automatically with a delay of approximately one second when the 
ignition is on and the selector lever is moved reverse. 

After a driving distance of 50 m or a speed of 30 km/h is exceeded, the system switches 
off. The indicator LED in the button goes out when the system is no longer active. 

The PDC can also be manually activated or deactivated by using the PDC button. 

PDC Acoustic Warning 

The distance to an obstacle is indicated by an intermittent tone according to its distance 
from the sensor. If, for example, an obstacle is detected to the left front of the vehicle, the 
sound signal is issued at the left front speaker. 



The closer the vehicle comes to the object, the shorter the freguency of the signal 
becomes. If the distance to a detected object is smaller than approximately 30 cm 
(11 in.), a continuous tone is issued. 

The sound signal is interrupted after approximately 3 seconds if the vehicle is driven 
parallel to a wall. 

This interruption does not occur in the continuous tone mode (distance smaller than 
30 cm).

PDC Visual Warning 

The distance to an obstacle can also be displayed visually in the Control Display. 

To enable the visual display Select “settings” in the CD and then select the “other vehicle 
functions” page which is displayed as the silhouette of a car. Activate it by pressing 
“PDC pic.” 

Once the visual display is enabled it will always display whenever the PDC becomes 
active. 

The display takes priority over any item that is currently being displayed on the Control 
Display. It can be temporarily switched off by pressing down on the Controller. 

To disable the visual display completely reguires returning to the settings menu and 
de-selecting it. 



Maximum visual detection range displayed in the CD 

The visual display uses color to distinguish how close an object is, the following 
colors are used: 

• Green: over 100 cm (39 inches) 

• Yellow: 100 to 50 cm (38 to 19 inches) 

• Red: less than 50 cm (less than 19 inches)

indicator in the PDC button flashes. 

The following Check Control Message is issued:
