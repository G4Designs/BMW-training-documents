Power Module 


The Power Module (PM) is one of the innovative new developments on the E65. The job 
of the Power Module is to ensure that the battery charge level is maintained when the 
engine is running and when the vehicle is at rest. The Power Module is also responsible 
for maintaining the power supply (in the event of faults in the electrical system) to impor¬ 
tant vehicle systems by disconnecting lower priority circuits. 



The PM functions include: 

• Optimum charging 

• Load-circuit peak reduction 

• Shut-down of auxiliary consumer circuits in the event of low voltage 

• Closed circuit current monitoring 

• Distribution mode

Power Supply Circuit 

The power supply for the general electrical system is controlled by the power module. 

The high amperage fuses located in the engine compartment, the generator and the 
starter motor are connected directly to the battery and are not supplied by the Power 
Module. 



6 

E65 Power Module 































Positive Battery Cable 

An aluminum battery cable in the E65 is used for the first time by a BMW automobile. 
The cable is flat (120mm 2 ) and runs along the vehicle interior from a junction box ahead 
of the spare tire well to the interior side of the front bulkhead. A smaller copper cable 
runs parallel to it in the vehicle interior. That smaller cable is supplied via a 250 amp fuse 
located inside the same junction box that feeds the aluminum cable. 



7 

E65 Power Module 









Battery 

From the start of production, the E65 was fitted with a single maintenance free battery 
(12V/110AH). The battery is located in the right hand side of the trunk below the vehicle 
jack. 

As of September 2002 production, the E65/E66 was fitted with new battery technology. 
The AGM batteries are now standard equipment. (AGM stands for Absorbent Glass Mat) 
The AGM battery variant is a 90 Ah unit and can be identified by the black plastic casing 
as opposed to the white casing on conventional lead-calcium batteries. 

AGM batteries are more expensive to produce, however this extra cost is offset by the fol¬ 
lowing benefits: 

• Greatly enhanced service life 

• Improved starting reliability at low temperatures 

• Reliable starting of engine with high starting current requirements 

• 100% maintenance free 

• Low environmental risk in the event of an accident 

In contrast to conventional lead-calcium batteries, the sulphuric acid in an AGM battery is 
not held freely in the battery housing.

E65 Power Module 

























The sulphuric acid is instead entirely bound into the mats of the glass-fibre fleece. For 
this reason, no acid can escape if the battery housing is damaged. In addition, the AGM 
battery is a sealed, airtight unit. This is possible because the gasses are converted back 
into water by the permeability of the separators. 

Construction 

AGM batteries differ from conventional lead-calcium batteries in the following points: 

• Larger plates which allow a power density some 25% greater. 

• Glass-fiber-fleece separators which enables a cycle consistency up to 3 times 
greater to be achieved which improves cold-starting ability, current consumption 
and service life. 

• Airtight housing with pressure relief valve 

• The inspection plugs are sealed and cannot be opened. 

• Acid bound in glass-fiber fleece: 

How it Works 

AGM batteries differ from conventional lead-calcium batteries in their environmental com¬ 
patibility and their retention of gases during charging.When a vehicle battery is charged, 
the electrolysis process emits the gases oxygen and hydrogen. 

In a conventional lead-calcium battery, these two gases are released into the atmosphere. 

In an AGM battery, the two gases are converted back into water: The oxygen created at 
the positive electrode during charging moves through the permeable glass-fiber fleece to 
the negative electrode, where it reacts with the hydrogen ions that are brought in with the 
electrolyte, to create water (oxygen cycle). In this manner, the gases, and thus the elec¬ 
trolyte, is not lost. 

Only when the gas production is excessive, that is when too much pressure is generated 
(20 to 200 mbar), does the pressure-relief valve open, thereby allowing gas to escape 
while also preventing entry of atmospheric oxygen. Because the pressure in the battery is 
regulated by a valve, the AGM battery is also known as the VRLA battery (valve-regulated 
lead acid). 


Service Instructions for AGM Batteries 

When handling AGM batteries, certain special factors must be taken into consideration 
with regard to battery renewal and installation location. 


Charging 


Warning!!! 


Do not charge AGM batteries with 14.8 volts! 
Do not use rapid charging programs! 


When charging batteries in the "stand alone" mode, the maximum charge voltage of 14.8 
volts must not be exceeded. Even briefly charging an AGM battery with a charge voltage 
of more than 14.8 volts (voltages usually used in rapid charge programs) will damage the 
battery.

E65 Power Module 



Installation Location 


Warning!!! 


Do not install AGM batteries in the engine compartment! 


Because of large temperature variations, AGM batteries must not be installed in the 
engine compartment. This would result in a significant reduction in the service life of the 
battery. 


Do Not Open 


Warning!!! 


Do not open AGM batteries 


On no account should AGM batteries be opened, as oxygen from the atmosphere would 
cause the battery to lose its chemical balance and cause it to fail. 


Battery Replacement 

An AGM battery, when installed as original eguipment, must always be replaced with an 
AGM battery. 

In special cases, where a customer's driving profile (e.g. short distance driving), results in 
a discharged battery, the AGM battery is a recommended replacement. Note that 
replacement batteries resulting from a customer's driving profile cannot be claimed under 
warranty. 


Fuses

Electronic Battery Master Switch 

The electronic battery master switch is made up of 4 MOSFET output stages (S Bat) and 
connects the input terminal 30 with the outputs KL30U and KL30B on the Power 
Module. 

The following functions are controlled by means of the power module according to the 
position of the battery switch: 

• Storage mode 

• Closed circuit current monitoring 

• Electronic fuses 

• Automatic electrical system isolation 

High Current Terminals (RADSOK) 

New high current terminals are used for the first time. The high current terminals are on 
the input terminal 30 and the outputs terminal 30U and 30B. These contacts are capa¬ 
ble of carrying current peaks (short term) of 220A. 

Advantages: 

• Continuous load capacity of up to 100A 

• Excellent and consistent current conduction over long periods 

• Low contact resistance 

• Low voltage drop even in the event of a large temperature rise 

• Consistently good spring characteristics 

• Contacts are self cleaning 

The contact are coated in a silver alloy. As compared to tin, nickel, gold and copper, silver 
has the lowest specific electrical resistance. 

In spite of high currents, the high current sockets are not soldered to the cable, as a spe¬ 
cial crimping technique ensures an excellent connection.

This controls the interior lighting and is located on the front interior lighting unit. The pos¬ 
sible settings are "Automatic control", "On", "Off" and “Workshop mode” (hold for 3 sec¬ 
onds). 

ExteriorTrunk Lid Release Button (TOEHK) 

This button is a direct input to the Power Module. The trunk lid is released by means of 
the button on the outside of the trunk lid. 

Trunk Lock Actuator Switch 

The switch in the trunk lock actuator is used to inform the Power Module as to the posi¬ 
tion of the lock actuator and to synchronize the SCA. it also controls the luggage com¬ 
partment lighting, the monitoring of the alarm system and the trunk lid warning light. 

SCA Contact 

This input is used to signal the PM that the SCA has rotated 180° (used to switch 
the electric motor). 

15_w (Wake-up) 

This is a redundant signal from the Car Access System which wakes up the Power 
Module. 

Battery Temperature Sensor 

Measures the temperature directly on the battery negative terminal. This information is 
used for the "optimum charging" function. The measuring range is -25°C to +75°C.

The advantages of this arrangement are: 

• The exterior lighting can remain on (for safety reasons) even if the electronic battery 
master switch is off. 

• The alarm system is always armed. 

• No additional fuses and wiring for actuators in nearby locations. 

Fuses 

The outputs for the rear window heater, Terminal R and Terminal 15, are not protected by 
conventional fuses. They are supplied via a power transistor (MOS-FET) in the Power 
Module. 

By measuring the current and comparing it with stored threshold levels, the Power 
Module can detect a short circuit and disconnect the circuit if needed. The outputs for 
CAS, DWA system and DME are protected by internal electronic fuses: FI, F2 and F3.

Power Module Functions 


Optimum Charging 

The battery voltage can fluctuate between 14.0 V and 15.5 V. The optimum charge volt¬ 
age is set according to the charge level of the battery, the battery temperature and the 
status of the external lights (higher charging voltage with lights off). The maximum set¬ 
ting is 16 V. 

Battery Charge Level Detection 

The Power Module knows what the charge level of the battery is at any time by calculat¬ 
ing the battery current when the vehicle is being driven and measuring the discharge cur¬ 
rent. 

When the vehicle is not in use, the charge level is re-calculated and updated by measur¬ 
ing the closed circuit battery voltage. If the vehicle battery is replaced it must be regis¬ 
tered with the Power Module so that the stored values can be deleted and a new calcula¬ 
tion started. This operation is described in “Service Functions”. 

Temperature-Dependent Battery Charging Voltage 

By using a charging characteristic map stored in the PM, the charge voltage of the gener¬ 
ator is adjusted according to the battery temperature. The diagram below shows the 
communication path necessary for the Power Module to inform the generator to increase 
or decrease charge voltage output. 



The Power Module detects the temperature of the battery and places the instruction 
"Increase charge voltage" on the K-CAN Periphery. The Car Access System (CAS) pass¬ 
es the message on to the K-CAN System bus. 

The Central Gateway Module (ZGM) receives the message. Performing its function as a 
"gateway control unit", it passes the message on to the PT-CAN. 

The DME (ECM) module receives the reguest to increase the charge voltage over the 
PT-CAN. 

16 

E65 Power Module 







The generator then receives the request to increase the charge voltage via the BSD lead 
(bit serial data interface). The electronic evaluation unit in the generator then adjusts the 
charge voltage accordingly. 

If the temp, sensor is detected as defective then the charging voltage will be fixed at 
14.3V.

t[°C] 

Increasing Idle Speed to Improve Battery Charging 

In order to drain as little energy as possible from the battery during freezing weather 
(below 34°F) the idling speed may be increased. 

This ensures that the battery charge level is kept high. If the charge level falls below the 
calculated minimum level for starting, the idling speed is increased to 750 rpm. 

The calculation of the minimum level for starting takes account of the temperature and 
the condition/age of the battery. 


17 

E65 Power Module 












Load-Circuit Peak Reduction 


If battery discharge is detected while the engine is running (despite increased idling 
speed), the power supply to electrical consumer circuits are gradually reduced or com¬ 
pletely shut off according to a table of priorities. The consumer systems concerned are 
divided into two groups: Priority group A and Priority group B. 


Priority Group A 

Priority Group B 

Rear window heater 

IHKAfan (Except during defrost) 

Headlight washing 

Rear IHKA fan (E66 only) 

All seat heaters 


Active seat 


Seat ventilation 


Steering wheel heater 


Mirror heater 


Windshield wiper blade heating 


Wet arm heating 



Priority A systems are dependent on battery SoC (State of Charge) and generator output 
during the operation of the consumer. 

Priority B systems are only dependent on the battery SoC. 

The Power Module also sends out a telegram indicating the status of the Load-circuit 
peak reduction function. The priority level of the message is classified by a number 0 
through 6 and is as follows: 

• 0 = Normal operation without peak reduction (KL 15 “ON”) 

• 1 = Terminal R “ON” without peak reduction OR generator defect 

or under-voltage acknowledged. 

• 4 = Corresponds to maximum peak reduction. 

• 5 = Corresponds to medium peak reduction. 

• 6 = Corresponds to minimum peak reduction. 

The computation by the Power Module to determine which priority level is necessary is 
based on the battery SoC. Example: the threshold for priority level 6 is a 65% SoC. 

Current vehicle priority levels can be displayed in the Diagnosis Program.

Shut-Down of Consumer Circuits in the Event of Low Voltage 

If the battery voltage drops below 10.5 V (for 5 seconds) due to high load levels, the 
Power Module sends out an instruction to increase the idling speed and to activate priori¬ 
tized shut-down of electrical consumer circuits. 

At the same time, the power outputs of the Power Module (interior lighting, consumer 
isolation circuit in roof/body zone) are switched off. 

The following Check Control message appears:

16 Minute Shut-Down of Consumer Circuits (Sleep mode) 

To prevent battery discharge by consumer items mistakingly left on, the interior lighting 
circuit (IB) and consumer circuits-roof zone (VA-D) are shut off 16 minutes after terminal 
R is switched off. 

Shut-Down of Auxiliary Consumers 

Auxiliary consumer circuits are items such as the CD, DWA, LM, EGS and IHKA 
(rest function). 

In order to ensure that the car is capable of starting, the charge level (SoC-State of 
Charge) of the battery is monitored when the vehicle is at rest. 

The minimum battery SoC reguired to ensure that the car can be started again is 
a calculated value. The calculation takes into account the: 

• Battery temperature measured over last few days 

• Engine type 

• Capacity of the battery fitted (110Ah for the 745i). 

The SoC calculation is displayed as a percentage of battery capacity (A fully charged 
battery is considered 80%). 

If the charge level of the battery gets close to that calculated minimum level as a result 
of the operation of an auxiliary consumer unit, the Power Module instructs that circuit to 
switch off. 

Two modes of operation are distinguished when shutting down auxiliary consumer 
circuits: 

• Auxiliary consumer with terminal R on. 

• Auxiliary consumer with terminal 0 (ignition off). 


21 

E65 Power Module 



Auxiliary Consumers and Terminal R 

When terminal 15 changes to terminal R, the message Priority level 1 is broadcast. 
Reduction of power consumption if necessary is then controlled on the basis of the table 
on page 18 and 19. 

The charge level of the battery is calculated. If it is still below the minimum level for start¬ 
ing the car, the following Check Control message appears: 


Check Control Message Displayed in 
KOMBI

Display 

Cause 

Recharge Battery! 

A 

Recharge Battery! Battery heavily dis¬ 
charged. Charge by driving for longer period 
or by using external charger. Battery will be 
disconnected soon. 

Battery discharged 


If the charge level does not improve, after 5 minutes the PM issues the "Shutdown 
counter" message (shut-down message is to inform modules to store any information 
prior to power being switched off). After a further 90 seconds, the vehicle's electrical 
system is shut down. 

This is on condition that no safety related consumers are switched on. 

If safety related consumers are on (e.g. hazard lights), the battery is not disconnected 
from the electrical system when the minimum battery SoC for starting the car is reached. 
The battery is allowed to fully discharge. 

Auxiliary Consumers and Terminal 0 

If the driver switches on an auxiliary consumer it logs itself on by issuing the message 
"Auxiliary consumer power management". By doing so, it triggers the PM to precisely 
calculate the battery charge level. 

Following a successful log-on, the auxiliary consumer goes into operation and the charge 
level of the battery is monitored. 

If the charge level falls below the minimum level for starting the car, the following Check 
Control message appears:

Five minutes later, if no legally required consumers are switched on, the PM automatically 
switches to "closed-circuit current monitoring" mode. 


22 

E65 Power Module 














Closed-Circuit Current Monitoring (Standby Current) 

When terminal 0 is active, the PM switches over to closed-circuit current monitoring after 
60 minutes. If an operation is performed on the car before 60 minutes has elapsed (e.g. 
central locking, trunk opened), the timer starts from the beginning again. 

Once that period has ended, the closed-circuit current should not exceed 80 mA. If the 
closed-circuit current exceeds 80 mA, after 5 minutes the PM issues the "Shutdown 
counter" message. After a further 90 seconds, the vehicle's electrical system is shut 
down for 5 seconds. 

If the guiescent current still exceeds 80 mA when the system is switched on again, the 
seguence described above is repeated. If the guiescent (sleep) current is then still over 
80 mA, the system is permanently shut down via the electronic battery master switch. 

The fault is recorded in the Power Module's fault memory (with details of environmental 
conditions and cause). 

When the signal “15w” from the CAS is detected, the electronic battery master switch 
is closed and the following Check Control message is displayed:

Closed-circuit current monitoring is automatically cancelled by a message from the 
LM that the hazard warning lights are active. 

When terminal R is switched off, current monitoring is also immediately activated. 

Normal current load on the vehicle drops in stages according to the vehicle programming 
for sleep mode (see the chart on the following page). 

If the monitored current is more than 120 amps (even as a random spike), the interior 
lighting, roof area consumers and body zone consumer circuits are immediately 
switched off.

Battery Switch OFF! 

A 


Battery Switch OFF! Re-set battery switch in 
luggage compartment to ON, refer to owners 
manual. 

Battery switch left in 
OFF position. 


When the signal “15w” or change-over of the battery switch to "closed-circuit current 
monitoring" is detected, the electronic battery master switch is closed. 

The car can still be started and driven in storage mode. All systems remain functional. 
The CC message remains active. 

When "Terminal R Off" is active, disconnection is carried out after 30 minutes (as 
explained above). 

Note: If no function of any kind is activated over a period of 3 weeks, the bat¬ 
tery is disconnected completely from the vehicle's electrical system. 
This prevents battery discharge. This function is independent of the 
position of the battery switch. 

Electronic Fuse 

If a short circuit current of over 250 A is detected, the battery master switch is opened. 

When the wake-up signal “15w” from the CAS is detected, then an attempt is made to 
close the battery master switch again. 

This procedure is repeated continually until the short circuit has been eliminated.

Central Battery Voltage Notification 

The Power Module continuously measures the battery voltage. This information is made 
available to all other control units via the bus link. This can be used, for example, to enable 
continuous running of the sliding/tilting sunroof regardless of battery voltage. 

Central battery voltage notification eliminates the need for individual measurement of bat¬ 
tery voltage by each control unit. 

Rear Window Heater (HHS) 

The electronic rear window heater output stage of the PM is activated by a "HHS On" (K- 
CAN-S via CAS via K-CAN -P) message from the IHKA control unit. Control is directly by 
the final stage. 

Interior Lighting 

The interior lighting is subdivided between three outputs (groups): 

• IB (interior lighting) 

• VA-K (consumer isolation circuit, body zone) 

• VA-D (consumer isolation circuit, roof zone) 

The interior lighting is controlled by the PM, the outputs are 12V stabilized-voltage. 

VA-K and VA-D are switched on/off according to the status of the relevant switches. 

Trunk Lid and Fuel Filler Flap Control 

The Power Module controls the following trunk-lid related functions of the body zone 
electronics: 

• Trunk lock actuator 

• Trunk lid automatic soft close motor (SCA) 

• Fuel filler flap lock actuator 

The necessary software, such as on times and repeat lockouts is integrated in the PM. 

For more details, refer to the chapter: Central Body Electronics. 

The PM monitors the trunk lid for the DWA system via the trunk lock actuator (ZV) con¬ 
tact switch.

Data Memory 

The data memory stores data relevant to the vehicle. That information provides a status 
read-out of the battery load and life. It can be accessed by way of the diagnosis function. 

The data memory will be used in future to obtain a load profile of the battery in normal 
operation that will be analyzed for the purposes of "condition based servicing." 

Emergency-Mode Functions 
Battery Temperature Sensor 

In the event of a defective sensor, a short circuit or an implausible value, the substitute 
value of 20°C is assumed. This corresponds to a fixed charge voltage of 14.3 V at the 
battery. 

Battery capacity (SoC) is calculated using the substitute value. 

Battery Switch 

If a fault is detected in the battery switch, the Power Module switches to Storage 
mode as if the switch were in the “OFF” position. 

Terminal 15w 

Shut-down of the PM in the absence of terminal 15w is prevented by the following 
duplicated signals: 

• Terminal 15 (from CAS via bus link) 

• Road speed > 2 km/h (from DSC via bus link) 

• System voltage > 13.2 V (PM central battery voltage notification) 

Bus Communication 

If bus communication is not possible, all information is "frozen."

Workshop Hints 


Battery Charging 

As with previous models, a battery charger can be connected in the engine compartment 
to the battery junction point or directly to the battery in the trunk. The PM detects an 
external battery charger if the battery voltage is above 13.2 V for 1 hour without the 
engine running. 

Following detection of external battery charging, a battery charge level of 80% is reported 
even if the charge level is higher or lower than that figure. 

Cigarette Lighter Battery Charging Function 

A trickle charger can also be connected to the cigarette lighter. However, the cigarette 
lighter is supplied by the body-zone consumer isolation circuit (VA-K) via a relay. 

If the "terminal R Off" signal is present for more than 60 minutes, that relay will be 
switched off by the consumer shutdown function. That would mean that a charger con¬ 
nected to the cigarette lighter would be disconnected from the battery. 

To prevent this, the consumer shut-down function can be deactivated. This is performed 
by the following procedure: 

Slide the battery switch off and on again twice within two seconds. Starting with the 
battery switch in the ON position, switch to OFF, Switch ON, Switch OFF and end with 
the switch in the ON position. Do this within 2 seconds, an the trickle charger can be 
used to charge the battery through the cigarette lighter. 

ON OFF 



The function is cancelled by: "terminal 15 On", switching the battery switch from "OFF" 
to "ON" or failure of the battery voltage to reach 12.6 V after 6 hours of charging.

Diagnosis 

All inputs/outputs that are part of the Power Module can be diagnosed by Test Modules 
or status checked by the Control Unit Functions of the Diagnosis Program. The outputs 
can also be activated by Component Activation and the power consumption displayed. 

The Diagnosis Program is based on the E46 concept. 

All electronic fuses and the electronic battery master switch are monitored for short cir¬ 
cuits/circuit breaks. In the event of a fault, an appropriate entry is made in the PM's fault 
memory and, if appropriate, a check control message initiated. 

Service Functions 
Sleep Mode Activation 

This function can be used to put the control units into sleep mode. The battery switch 
must be set to “ON” when using this feature. The Test module will indicate whether the 
function was successful or not. 

Battery Replacement Registration 

This Service Function informs the PM that the battery has been replaced. It completes 
the following operations: 

• The battery capacity is set to 80%. 

• The current odometer reading is stored. 

The odometer readings at which the last seven battery replacements took place can be 
read off from the Diagnosis Reguests of Control Unit Functions. 

• The stored battery statistics (current, voltage, battery charge level) are deleted. 

• The stored temperature statistics are deleted. 

Transport Mode Clearing 

Vehicles that arrive at the BMW centers may have the Transport Mode cleared by using 
the Test Module under the Service Functions menu. Different from the Storage Mode 
described on page 24, certain consumers such as the radio, interior lights, and electric 
windows (except drivers side) are permanently switched off.
