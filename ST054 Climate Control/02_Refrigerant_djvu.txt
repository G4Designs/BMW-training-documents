Introduction 


What is ozone and why is it a cause for concern? 

Ozone is an energy-rich modification of oxygen with three oxygen atoms in the mole¬ 
cule. It has the chemical symbol 0 3 . Ozone plays a decisive part in the chemical and 
biological processes on earth as it absorbs shortwave, solar UV radiation. With low ozone 
values in the stratosphere, larger quantities of UV-B- radiation could reach the earth's 
surface and cause serious problems for humans, animals and plants. On the one hand, 
ozone is an essential substance for life on earth, on the other hand, it can be harmful to 
humans, plants and animals when located near the earth's surface (troposphere). It is a 
proven fact that high ozone values near the ground can cause respiratory problems and 
can destroy the harvest of certain grain crops. 

In 1985, a team of British scientists reported extremely low ozone values over Halley Bay 
in the Antarctic. This ozone hole was caused by the chemical reactions of chlorine and 
nitrogen. 


• Stratosphere: The atmospheric layer 
between an altitude of approximately 
15 and 50 km 

• UV-B: Wave length 280-320 nm; 
where 1 nm = 10-9 m 

• Troposphere: The atmospheric layer 
between the earth's surface and an alti¬ 
tude of approx. 15 km.

How Ozone is Formed and Destroyed 



The air in the stratosphere is constantly influenced by the 
sun's UV radiation. 




When these intensive UV rays hit an oxygen molecule 
(0 2 ), the molecule splits into two free oxygen atoms (0) 
(mono-atomic oxygen). 



The free oxygen atom can now combine with an oxygen 
molecule. 



Together they form an ozone molecule (0 3 ).

0 n the one hand, the ability of ozone to absorb large 
quantities of UV radiation makes it essential for life on 
earth while, on the other hand, it can lead to its own 
destruction. 




mTi 






When ozone absorbs UV rays.the ozone molecule splits 
into a free oxygen atom and a normal oxygen molecule. 





The free oxygen atom can now collide with an ozone 
molecule and combine with it. 



Two normal oxygen molecules then result from this 
combination.

CFC's and Our Environment 

During the life of our earth, nature has controlled and balanced out the creation and 
depletion of ozone. This balance is easierto understand when compared to a bucket of 
water with a leak; the water level remains the same as long as the same amount of water 
is replenished. The earth's ozone layer behaves in the same way. As long as the same 
amount of ozone is created and depleted, the ozone layer will remain constant; however, 
if more ozone is depleted than is created, an ozone deficiency will occurthat in the long 
term will lead to the so-called ozone hole. 

In the last 20 years, scientists have established that man himself is largely responsible for 
the depletion of the ozone layer. One of the most significant causes for the destruction of 
the ozone layer is the manufacture and use ofCFC products. The ever-growing mobility 
of humans, not only in individual passengervehicle traffic but also in the area of public 
transport, e.g. ships and airplanes also contributes to the destruction of ozone. It takes a 
considerable amount of time forthe exhaust gasses from motorvehicles and industrial 
plant to reach the stratosphere. The situation is somewhat different in the case of aircraft. 
They fly almost exclusively in the stratosphere with their CO emissions directly in this 
atmospheric layer. 

CFC5 vapors (CFC molecules) are relatively harmless near the earth's surface (tropos¬ 
phere) as here they are protected from the sun's UV rays. Unfortunately, these CFC mol¬ 
ecules do not stay in the troposphere where they cause no or very little harm but rather 
they are conveyed upwards into the stratosphere as the result of a complicated mixing 
process. There the CFC molecules are constantly bombarded by UV rays from the sun. 
This results in a chemical reaction that destroys natural ozone.

Scientific research has shown that CFC's are extremely harmful to our environment with 
particular emphasis on the free chlorine atoms. CFC's destroy the ozone layer which sur¬ 
rounds our earth as a protective envelope against radiation and is therefore a major con¬ 
tributing factor to the enlargement of the ozone hole. Added to this, it promotes the 
greenhouse effect which leads to progressive global warming with all its negative conse¬ 
quences such as worldwide increase in the sea level and climatic changes. 

CFC's and the Ozone Layer 

Chemically, CFC is very stable and can remain for 60 to 120 years in the atmosphere. 
The earth's atmosphere is made up of various layers. Our weather is generated in the 
layer closest to the earth's surface,(troposphere). Here, CFC's resist the natural depletion 
processes, (it does not break down into individual molecules). 

After ascending fora period of 5 to 10 years, the CFC reach the next higher layer, the 
stratosphere containing ozone (as from an altitude of approx. 15 km). Here, the prevailing 
radiation conditions are considerably more intensive. 

Above all, it is the powerful ultraviolet (UV) radiation that breaks down the CFC molecules 
thus releasing the chlorine atoms which were previously bound in the molecule. 

UV radiation splits ozone (O 3 ) into one oxygen molecule (O 2 ) and one oxygen atom (0). 
Oxygen atoms and molecules from other reactions recombine with ozone. This process 
takes place in the ozonosphere, a part of the stratosphere at an altitude of 20 to 50 km.

Refrigerant 


Free oxygen molecules (0 2 ), how¬ 
ever, cannot absorb UV radiation. 
The ozone layer is vital to us. The 
high ozone content of the stratos¬ 
phere forms a natural protective 
shield - particularly against UV 
rays. Intense radiation causes an 
acceleration in the extinction of 
flora species, general growth is 
curbed. 

Mammals and humans are more 
susceptible to disease, the cancer 
rate (particularly skin cancer) 
increases. Ozone depletion is 
ascertainable worldwide, the so- 
called ozone hole is growing, the 
trend for the future is already pre¬ 
programmed today. Each gram of 
CFC that escapes into the atmos¬ 
phere is one gram too much. 



Reaction Between C FC 's and Ozone in the Atmosphere 

C hlorine (CI) is a constituent of a 
CFC refrigerant such as R12. 

When not handled properly, the 
R12 molecule rises - (as it is 
lighter than air up to the ozone 
layer). Due to UV radiation, a chlo¬ 
rine atom in the CFC is released 
and reacts with the ozone. 

Consequently, the ozone breaks 
down and an oxygen molecule 
(0 2 ) and chlorine monoxide (CIO) 
remain, subsequently reacting 
again with oxygen to release chlo¬ 
rine (Cl). This cycle can be repeat¬ 
ed up to 100,000 times.

Refrigerant - General Information 


Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) 

The need to develop chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) stems from the demand fora coolant 
that was to have neither toxic nor combustible properties and was not to be volatile. 

The CFC with the name dichlorodifluoromethane was developed by the chemists 
"Midgley" and "Henne" and was produced underthe trade name Freon 12 as froml931. 
At that time, Freon 12 represented a significant new development. It could replace the 
high-risk substances such as ammonia and methyl chloride that required stringent safety 
measures. In the years that followed, CFC's were developed for the most diverse range 
of applications (low temperature applications in refrigeration technology, foaming agents 
for the aerosol industry, medical propellant in spray cans). Products containing CFC's 
came underpressure as the discussion concerning the ozone hole flared up in the 
1970s. Alternatives to CFC's had to be found in orderto stop the ozone depletion. 

The 1987 Montreal Protocol which was signed by 46 states stipulated a gradual step by 
step reduction of halogenated CFC's by 50%.The signatory states make up 75% ofthe 
total CFC production capacity. 

The United States Congress amended in 1990 the Clean Air Act. The far more stringent 
CFC-halon prohibition ordinance applies in Germany that was made law by the Federal 
government in 1991. 

Stipulations forCFC R12 (as also forotherCFC's) 

• Stop production of R12 as of J anuary 1,1995. 

• Import prohibition from third countries into EU countries. 

• Filling ban in motor vehicle air conditioning systems as ofj uly 1998 

Note: Legislation is currently working on an ordinance that will further restrict 
trade in R12 already in the market as technically perfected alternatives 
are available. 

Refrigerant and Global Warming 

Solar radiation or insolation on the earth's surface is reflected as infrared radiation. 
However, trace gasses - the most important being C0 2 - also reflect these waves in the 
troposphere. This results in a climatic heating effect known as the greenhouse effect or 
global warming. CFC's have a high share ofthe growing trace gas concentration. By pre¬ 
venting the reflection or retaining the heat radiation, the greenhouse effect results in 
global warming with incalculable climatic changes with the following affects: 

• Melting ofthe polar caps; worldwide increase in sea level (flooding) 

• Serious climatic changes; Expansion ofthe deserts, increased evaporation = higher 
precipitation, displacement of sea currents, increased occurrence of tornados, etc.

Refrigerant Chemical Properties 

• R134a (tetrafluoroethane) has a different chemical composition than R12 
(dichlorodifluoromethane) and has no chlorine atoms. 

• R12 is colorless and odorless, R134a has a slight ether-like odor. 

• R134a more readily absorbs moisture than R12 (strongly hygroscopic due to asym¬ 
metric hydrogen atom distribution). 

• R134a corrodes copper and various seal and component materials in R12 systems. 
R134a must therefore never be used in an R12 system as this would result in its 
rapid destruction. 

Note: Escaping or leaking R134a vapors form decomposition products with high 
irritation and warning effects on contact with fire and glowing objects. 

The name of the refrigerant is derived from the composition of their molecules.

Only the refrigerant R134a is used in today's motor vehicle air conditioning systems. 
R134a is a fluorohydrocarbon and has no chlorine atoms as in the refrigerant R12 that 
has a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the earth's atmosphere. It is invisible as a gas 
and colorless in a vapor and liquid state. 

Although the substitute refrigerant R134a has no ozone depletion potential (ODP =0), 
it does have a global warming potential of approx. 30% (GWP = 0.3) of R12 used as a 
comparison standard (ODP =1.0 and GWP =3.0). 


Note: 1 kg of R12 has the same greenhouse effect as 4000 tof CO 2 . R134a 
contributes to a very small extent to global warming. The ozone 
depletion potential equals zero.

Refrigerant 




The vapor-pressure curve of R134a is very similar to that of R12.The refrigerating capaci¬ 
ty approximately corresponds to that of R12. 

It is possible to convert air conditioning systems designed for R12 to R134a with a spe¬ 
cial conversion kit (retrofit) 

The refrigerant must not be mixed, i.e. only the specific refrigerant intended for the 
respective air conditioning system must be used. 

The types of refrigerant used are dichlorodifluoromethane (R12) that boils at -29.8°C 
and tetrafluoroethane (R134a) that boils at -26.5°C.. 


Note: The specified boiling points correspond to the boiling temperature at 
standard atmospheric pressure (760 torr = 1013.25 mbar). 


Physical Data of the Refrigerant 

The critical pressure means that there is no longer a separating surface between liquid 
and vapor above this pressure and vapor above this pressure. A substance above its criti¬ 
cal point is always in a vapor state. Condensation is no longer possible when a gas is 
heated beyond the critical point.

Refrigerant 

























At temperatures below the critical point, all types of 
refrigerant in pressure vessels exhibit a liquid and 
vapor phase, i.e. there is a vapor cushion above the 
liquid. The pressure in the container depends on the 
ambient pressure for as long as, in addition to liquid, 
there is still vapor in the container (see vapor-pres¬ 
sure table). 

The boiling point of a liquid specified in tables always 
refers to the atmospheric pressure of 1 bar. The boil¬ 
ing point of a liquid changes if the pressure above it 
changes. All homogeneous liquids behave in this 
way. 

The R134a/R12 vapor-pressure curves show that, for 
example at constant pressure, the vapor becomes liq¬ 
uid due to a drop in pressure (in the condenser) or 
that the refrigerant changes from the liquid to the 
vapor state due to a drop in pressure (evaporator) 
Corresponding to the vapor-pressure curve, the table 
of vapor pressures is derived as a function of temper¬ 
ature for R12 and R134a.This table can be used to 
determine the evaporation temperature and pressure.

Methane 


Methane is the Basis for R12 

To obtain Freon R12, 2 hydrogen atoms are replaced by 
2 chlorine or 2 fluorine atoms, resulting in the product 
dichlorofluoromethane (R12). Freon R12 is referred to as 
a fully halogenated hydrocarbon. 

All hydrogen atoms have been replaced by halogens. 
Halogens include the substances fluorine (F), chlorine 
(Cl), bromine (Br) and iodine (I). Since chlorine destroys 
the ozone layer in the atmosphere, the fluorocarbon (FC) 
R134a was developed as a substitute for the refrigerant 
R12.

Ethane 



R134a 



Ethane is Basis for R134a 

R134a has no chlorine atom and therefore also no ozone 
depletion potential. The hydrocarbon ethane serves as the 
basis forthe production of R134a. 

In the case of ethane, four of six hydrogen atoms are 
replaced by fluorine atoms, producing a product with the 
chemical designation tetrafluoroethane (R134a) 



The term hydrogen atom, as well a fluorine or chlorine 
atom, is not entirely correct in this case; as from a chem¬ 
istry point of view, these substances exist in molecular 
form.

Refrigerant Oil 


A special refrigerant oil is necessary to lubricate all moving parts in the air conditioning 
system. No oils other than refrigerant oil must be used as they may cause copper 
deposits, coke formation, varnishing orfoaming.This would result in the premature wear 
and destruction of the moving parts. 

Polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil is special synthetic oil that has been developed and is only 
to be used for refrigerant circuits with R134a.The refrigerant oil can also be used 
together with a certain type of compressor. 

PAG Oil 

• M ixable and compatible with the refrigerant itself 

• Good lubricating properties 

• Is Hygroscopic (absorbs humidity) 

• Acid free 

• M aintains the seals in the system 


Note: R12 systems use mineral oil retrofitting and PAG oil can never be mixed 
with mineral oil. Esteroil is compatible with both mineral and PAG thus 
it is used when retrofitting a R12 system to R134a.
