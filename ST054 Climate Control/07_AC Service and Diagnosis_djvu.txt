Safety Requirements 


Product Properties 

Although R134a is non-toxic, non-flammable and not explosive with air in any mix ratio at 
normal temperatures, various safety measures must still be observed. The filled refriger¬ 
ant circuit is pressurized. The refrigerant must be extracted when performing repairs on 
the air conditioning system. As a gas, R134a is colorless, odorless and heavierthan air. 
The various refrigerants that are used in vehicle air conditioning systems belong to the 
substance class of the new generation of refrigerants based on chlorine-free, partly fluo- 
rinated hydrocarbons (H-FCs, R134a). 

With regard to their physical properties, these are refrigerants that condense under pres¬ 
sure. They are subject to the pressure vessel ordinance and must be filled only in 
approved and correspondingly identified pressurized gas containers. Specific require¬ 
ments that must be adhered to apply to their safe and correct use. 

Handling Refrigerant 

After opening refrigerant containers, the content can escape in liquid orvaporform. 

The higherthe pressure in the containerthe more intense the reaction.The pressure 
level depends on two conditions: 

• What type of refrigerant is in the container? The lowerthe boiling point, the higher 
the pressure. 

• How high is the temperature? The higherthe temperature, the higherthe pressures. 

Wear Safety goggles! 

Wear safety goggles. They prevent refrigerant from 
entering the eyes and possibly causing serious 
damage due to its freezing effect. 

Wear protective gloves, do not allow liquid refriger¬ 
ant to make contact with the skin! 

Refrigerants effectively dissolve greases and oils. 

They therefore remove the protective oily layer 
when they come in contact with the skin. S kin 
without the protective oily layer is sensitive to low 
temperatures and susceptible to illness causing 
germs. 

When it evaporates, the refrigerant absorbs heat from the environment even if this is 
human skin. Very low temperatures can be reached, resulting in local frostbite (boiling 
point of R12 =-30°C,R134a-26.5°C).

AirConditioning Service and Diagnosis 




Do not inhale refrigerant vapors in higher concentrations! Leaking refrigerant vapors 
mix with the ambient air and dispiace the oxygen necessaryfor breathing. The worksta¬ 
tions must be weii ventiiated if refrigerant escapes in higher concentrations. Immediately 
seek medical assistance if problems occur after inhaling refrigerant vapors! Rooms 
must be sufficientiy ventiiated or switch on extractor system if avaiiabie. 

No Smoking! 

Refrigerants can breakdown in the heat from cigarettes. The resuiting substances are 
toxic and must not be inhaied. Avoid weiding and soidering on fiiied air conditioning sys¬ 
tems! Before weiding and soidering on air conditioning systems, the refrigerant must be 
extracted and residue removed by biowing out the system with nitrogen. 

The decomposition products produced when the refrigerant is subject to the effects of 
heat are not oniy toxic but are aiso very corrosive, affecting pipes and system compo¬ 
nents. The corrosive substances are essentiaiiy hydrogen chioride and hydrogen fluoride. 
The presence of these decomposition products is associated with a pungent odor. Under 
no circumstances must these substances be inhaled as they can damage the respiratory 
tract, the lungs and other organs. 

FirstAid! 

1. In the eventof contact with the eyes, flush out with plenty of flowing water and seek 
medical assistance. 

2. In the eventof contact with the skin, immediately remove soaked clothing and flush 
skin with plenty of water. 

3. If refrigerant vapors in high concentrations are inhaled make sure the person affected 
is immediately brought out into the fresh air. Seek medical assistance. Provide oxygen 
if breathing difficulties occur. If the person affected suffers breathing difficulty oris no 
longer breathing, tilt back the head and perform CPR. 

Handling PAG Oil 

• Do not store in the vicinity of flames, heat or oxides 

• Avoid contact with the eyes 

• Do not inhale (vapors) 

• Avoid prolonged or repeated skin contact 

FirstAid Measures: 

• After inhalation: Take the person into the fresh air and seek medical assistance. 

• After skin contact: Wash thoroughly with soap and water. 

• Aftereye contact: Flush thoroughly with water. 

• Afterswallowing: Seek medical assistance. Do not induce vomiting.

Important Service Information 


• store all spare parts in a dry place and keep locked. 

• When installing parts, only remove the plugs just before installation. This require¬ 
ment applies particularly to the dryer. A dryerthat is not sealed can absorb moisture, 
rendering it unusable. Immediately close off open pipes with plugs when performing 
repairs on the refrigerant circuit. 

• Keep empty refrigerant bottles closed. 

• Acquire refrigerant only through BMW Parts Service orspecialized trade. 

• Do not perform repairs in the open under moist weather conditions. 

• Replace the dryer following intervention (repair) in the refrigerant circuit if it was left 
open forlongerthan 24 hours orthere was a leak in the air conditioning system. 

• Do not use refrigerant oil from open containers. 

• Moisture in the refrigerant circuit not only diminishes the cooling capacity but also 
oxidation can cause soiling of the air conditioning system, resulting in expensive 
repairs and down-time. 

• Evacuate the refrigerant circuit before placing it into operation. Additional drying can 
be achieved by interrupting the evacuation process and flushing with refrigerant or 
blowing through with nitrogen (if available) priorto initial operation.This procedure 
can increase the cooling capacity again if it was diminished as the result of moisture. 

• In warranty cases, plugs must be fitted on the old parts in order to be able to deter¬ 
mine the cause of the damage. 

Refrigerant Circuit 

The following points must be observed when working on the refrigerant circuit: 

• Extract all the refrigerant before opening the refrigerant circuit. 

• After extracting the refrigerant, measure and replace the quantity of oil also extracted. 

• Replenish the prescribed quantity of oil (specified in TIS) when replacing compo¬ 
nents. 

• First evacuate the system for at least 30 minutes before refilling the circuit with 
refrigerant. 

• Always replace the liquid reservoir (dryer) if there is a leak in the system or it was 
opened forlongerthan 24 hours during repair. 

• Always replace the seals of the connections that were opened and wet with oil prior 
to assembly.

AirConditioning Service and Diagnosis 




Compressor Service 

• When troubleshooting a noisy compressor complaint, make sure the noise is present 
only when the clutch is engaged. 

• If it is present when the clutch is not engaged, remove the compressor drive belt 
and check again. 

• If the noise continues, it is not related to the compressor. 

• If removing the drive belt reduces or eliminates the noise, check the torque of the 
compressor and bracket mounting bolts. 

• Checkthe belt tension and condition, and tensioner pullies which can produce 
rattling noises that would sound like a defective compressor. 

• A loose/slipping belt can cause noise. 

• A belt that is too tight can damage the clutch bearings. 

• If the compressor is noisy with the compressor clutch engaged, make sure the 
system is charged with the correct amount of refrigerant. 

• An over-charged system can cause compressor noise. 

• If the A/C system is overcharged with refrigerant, the liquid entering the compressor 
can damage it. 

• When troubleshooting a noisy compressor complaint, recoverthe refrigerant and 
recharge the system with the correct amount. 

• A failed compressor must be returned with the inlet and outlet ports sealed using 
the plastic caps from the replacement compressor. Otherwise the "failed” compres¬ 
sor will be damaged by moisture, and it will be impossible for Warranty to analyze it.

Air Conditioning Service and Diagnosis 




Compressors with plastic pulley: 

• Avoid impact on the plastic pulley (through tools, contact with base). 

• Send back damaged compressors only in original packaging. 

Note: After replacing compressor It is important to perform the following run- 
ning-in procedure when operating a new compressorforthe firsttime. 

• Switch off air conditioning system. 

• Set all air outlet nozzles on the instrument panel to "OFF". 

• Start engine and allow idle speed to stabilize. 

• Set blower capacity to min. 75% of the maximum blower capacity. 

• Switch on air conditioning and allow to run for at least 2 minutes at idle speed. 

Risk of damage at higherspeed! (Referto DIS Service Functions for more 
detailed instructions) 

When extracting the refrigerant from the air conditioning system, the refrigerator 
oil is also removed and collected in the oil separator of the service station. 

Following extraction, the refrigerant in the ser¬ 
vice station must be cleaned as there still may 
be a liquid refrige rant-oil mixture in the oil sepa¬ 
rator. The cleaning procedure fully evaporates 
the refrigerant leaving only the refrigerant oil 
previously collected in the oil separator. 

Measure and note down this quantity of refrig¬ 
erator oil.

Refrigerant Oil Service Procedure 



Empty the refrigerant oil remaining in the old com¬ 
pressor via the filler plug into a measuring beaker. 



M easure the collected quantity of refrigerant oil from 
the old compressor. 



Depending on the version, the new compressor is 
filled with 120 to 200g of refrigerant oil at the factory. 

Open the filler plug and fill the entire content of the 
(new) compressor into a clean container. 

Replace seal if necessary.

Air Conditioning Service and Diagnosis 
















Using only new refrigerant oil, fill the same 
quantity as extracted from the old compressor 
+ lOg safety amount into a clean measuring 
beaker and refill the new compressor. 

The remainder of the new refrigerant oil can 
be filled into the reservoir of the service sta¬ 
tion. Othen/vise, the surplus refrigerant oil 
must be disposed of correctly.

Tools and Equipment 


There are a variety of tools and equipment used for the correct handling, 
service and diagnosis of the AC system: 

• Temperature Sensing Tools 

• Recycling/Charging Equipment 

• Refrigerant Leak Detectors 

Temperature Sensing Tools 

The correct way to service and diagnose a climate control system relies heavily on the 
ability to accurately measuring the systems temperature output. To know the ambient 
temperature and humidity is as important as the output temperature of the system, 
because these are linked together as showed in the chart on the previous page. 

Thermometers 

The most inexpensive and popular among technicians is the typical pocket thermometer. 
Similarto a meat thermometer it has a flat gauge (mechanical and digital) with a long 
sensing stem on the other end. Because of its design it is convenient to introduce it into 
outlet vents on the vehicle.

Pyrometer 

A pyrometer is a non contact, point and shoot 
measuring tool. 

The typical design uses a laser aimed device that 
consists of a lens to focus the infrared (IR) energy 
on to a detector, which converts the energy to an 
electrical signal that can be displayed in units of 
temperature after being compensated for ambient 
temperature variation. 

Pyrometers are especially useful where other mea¬ 
suring tools have limitations, like testing ther¬ 
mostats, temperature sensors, radiator/ heater core 
flow, condenser efficiency, and hard to reach ther¬ 
mostatic expansion valves, evaporators. 


Recycling/Charging Equipment 

A proper system charging station includes 
the following components: 

• A manifold gauge set. 

• A charging cylinder. 

• A bulk refrigerant supply tank. 

• A vacuum pump. 

• Hoses for connection to the automotive A/C system. 

• An electronic leak detector. 

• A thermometer. 

This setup will allow you to evacuate and charge an A/C system. These units filter and 
remove moisture the refrigerant, before discharging it into a recovery tank. 

Note: Referto the operating instructions of the AC equipment you are working 
with for specific operating instructions. 

Note: The refrigerant type must be identified priorto attempting any service 
on the vehicle, generally the refrigerant used is evident by the connec¬ 
tions and by reading the label underthe hood, but when in doubt a refrig¬ 
erant identifier may be used.

Connecting Recycling/Charging Equipmentto a Vehicle 



The LOW side hose is BLUE in colorand incorporates 
a quick disconnect type fitting (similarto an air line) 
along with a shut off valve so as to minimize refrigerant 
leakage. 


The High side hose is RED in colorand also incorpo¬ 
rates a quick disconnect type fitting along with a shut 
off valve so as to minimize refrigerant leakage.

Air Conditioning Service and Diagnosis 





Refrigerant Recovery Process 

Once the type of refrigerant has been identified, the recovery machine is plugged into a 
110 ac volt power supply and connected to the vehicle. First, connect the hoses to the 
service fittings on the vehicle, then open the shut off valves. The gauges will show the 
system pressure on both the low and high sides. These pressures will vary depending on 
the type of vehicle you are working on and how much refrigerant remains in the system. 

Now, power on the recovery/recycle machine and activate the recovery process. It is 
important to follow the operating instructions for the recovery equipment you are using 
since every machine is slightly different. 

Once recovery begins, pressures will decrease as the refrigerant is removed from the sys¬ 
tem. The machine will empty the system and then pull it down to a vacuum state until all 
of the refrigerant has been recovered. When all the refrigerant has been recovered, the 
machine will automatically shut off The shutoff point is based off of vacuum pressure 
and is different depending on the equipment manufacturer. 

If the system holds a vacuum for at least two minutes and never shows a positive pres¬ 
sure when the process has completed, then the refrigerant has been completely removed 
from the system. However, if pressures begin to creep up afterthe machine has stopped, 
and then there is still refrigerant trapped in the system. The recovery process has to be 
repeated to remove the remaining refrigerant. Once the refrigerant has been successfully 
recovered, close the shutoff valves and disconnect the recovery machine from the sys¬ 
tem. 

Check the oil collection bottle and record the amount of oil that was removed during 
recovery, this amount you will add when recharging the system. The recovery stage is 
complete. The technician can now open the system and make any needed repairs. 

When all repairs are complete, the system can be recharged. You will learn about 
recharging the system later in this lesson. 

Recycling Process 

As refrigerant is removed from the air conditioning system during the recovery stage, it is 
drawn through afilterto remove dirt, oil, air and water. This allows for reuse of the refrig¬ 
erant upon completion of the repair. The filter used for recycling the refrigerant needs to 
replace at a recommended service interval specified by the equipment manufacturer. 

There is an oil separator on the recovery machine that removes oil from the refrigerant 
and stores it in a oil storage container. Record the amount of oil recovered to determine 
how much oil should be used for recharging. When recharging, the amount of oil is very 
important for proper operation of the system. Always check the manufacturer's recom¬ 
mendations before adding any oil to the vehicle. This is especially true if the system has 
been opened or damaged priorto service. 


16 

AirConditioning Service and Diagnosis 



Recharging Process 


Before the A/C system can be recharged, the air, moisture and any contaminant's that 
may have entered the system during the repair must be removed. This is accomplished 
by pumping the system down to a vacuum, removing the air and debris from the system. 
To evacuate a system, regardless of the equipment being used, follow these guidelines: 

• Connect the hoses of the recovery/recycling machine to the vehicle service fittings. 

• Open both valves on the connectors. 

• Now, activate the vacuum pump and run fora minimum of 30 minutes. 

• Close both valves on the connectors and turn off the vacuum pump. 

• Now, write down the gauge readings and let the vehicle sitforfive minutes. 

• Recheck the gauge readings and note the difference. 


- If the gauge readings differ more then 2” of vacuum in 5 minutes, then there 
is a leak in the system. 

- If the gauge readings change very little, then the system is ready to be 
recharged.

CAUTION! 

*“”• sWl f ttl4 5 .; 


To determine the exact amount of refrigerant 
needed for the vehicle's air conditioning system, 
locate the label underthe hood. The label speci¬ 
fies the type and quantity of refrigerant the sys¬ 
tem requires. This vehicle label calls for 
1.30 +/- 0.02 lbs of R134a. 


Along with the refrigerant, oil has to be added back in the system.The machine collects 
the oil during the recovery process. M easure the oil you recovered, then add the amount 
of oil that normally collects in the components you replaced (if any). The resulting 
amount of oil is to be put back into the system. 

• If you have replaced the condenser or evaporator, 2 additional ounces of additional 
oil must be added. 

• If you have replaced the receiver dryer on a vehicle that uses the stand-alone type 
receiver dryer, you would add 1 additional ounce of oil. 

• Hoses do not collect much oil so if just a hose was replaced, only the oil measured 
in the cup during recovery will be needed. 

Follow the operating manual forthe recharging equipment you are using to calibrate the 
correct amount of refrigerant in the machine. Then, following the operating manual, add 
the refrigerant to the A/C system.

Air Conditioning Service and Diagnosis 




Refrigerant Leak Detectors 

The two approved methods for leak testing an A/C system are a leak detector (sniffer) 
and by installing fluorescent dye into the system. 

S niffer Leak Detector 

The sniffer leak detector is a device that has circuitry capable of detecting refrigerant 
leaks as small as 0.40 oz peryear. A small internal motordraws in airthrough the tip of 
the probe and when refrigerant is detected, a lamp illuminates ora buzzer or audible 
beeper sounds depending on the type you are using. Leak detectors calibrated for 
R-134a will detect R-12, but leak detectors calibrated for R-12 will not detect R-134a. 

Using a leak detector like this takes experience 
and practice. M any times an oily black dust 
collects on or around leaking component. This 
evidence of escaping oil and refrigerant and is 
a very good place to start. 

A low-pressure side leak may only occur when 
the system is turned off because pressures are 
higher with the system off The high-pressure 
side might leak when the system is ON for 
pressures are higher when the system is ON. 

It is always better, if you can, to check the sys¬ 
tem for leaks with it OFF. The cooling fan circu¬ 
lates the air in the engine compartment and 
makes it difficult to identify the leak. 

The tip of the detector can be inserted in and around the suspected refrigerant leaks like 
between condenserfins orthe outlet vents on the dash or in the water drain hose of the 
evaporator box to check for a leaking evaporator. A downside to using this method would 
be that in some shops the service area may be contaminated with different gasses that 
make the tool a somewhat difficult to operate. 

Fluorescent Dye 

To check for a leak with dye, the dye has to be added to the system and then monitored 
using an ultraviolet lamp and special safety glasses. When the ultraviolet beam of light 
shines on the suspected fluid, it illuminates with a yellow glow as evidence of the refriger¬ 
ant leak. Caution must be observed when using the dye because it tends to stain every¬ 
thing it touches, so a special cleaning solution is supplied with the kit. 

Note: Referto SIB 04 14 04 "A/C Leak detection Kit" R-134a A/C dye leak 
tester has been approved for use on BMW Group vehicles. 



18 

AirConditioning Service and Diagnosis 





The typical dye kit includes: 

• UV protecting safety glasses 

• 12 volt UV/blue lOOW lamp 

• A container of fluorescent dye 

• Dye injector device 

• Hose adapters 

• Dye cleaner/remover 

• Instructions 


LeakTesting the A/C System 

Always be aware of the safety measures associated with handling refrigerant as far as 
wearing eye protection, gloves and respiratory equipment. (Referto Safety Section) 

If the refrigerant leak was not identified during the evacuation, the system must be filled 
before it can be tested for leaks with either dye or the electronic leak detection device. 

Some helpful hints to remember when using a Dye Leak Detector: 

• It is better to check the Low Side for leaks with the A/C system off 

• The high Side is best checked for leaks with the A/C system on. 

• Refrigerant is heavier than air. Therefore you must always test below the 
suspected lines, connections and components. 

• Commonly used shop solvent fumes, wind and cooling fans may throw off 
your diagnosis. 

• When using the dye method, keep in mind that dye stains and a leak inside 
the vehicle like an evaporator can damage the interior. 

• Evaporator leaks are best diagnosed with an electronic leak detector in the 
vent outlets or pressure tested with Nitrogen.

Air Conditioning Service and Diagnosis 














Symptoms Diagnosis and Gauge Readings 


Refrigerant Pressure 

Refrigerant pressure is directly proportional to its temperature so as the temperature 
goes up so does the pressure and vice versa. 

Refrigerant in the A/C system is provoked to change state from a liquid to a gas and back 
again. During every change of state heat is either absorbed or given away in the 
process. This thermodynamic property is put to use in the expansion valve to evaporator 
section (Low Side) and in the compressorto condenser section (High Side) of all A/C 
systems. 

In the High side, dry, pressurized liquid refrigerant exits the receiver dryer and is made to 
pass through a metered orifice in the expansion valve on its way to the evaporator. It is 
here entering the Low side, that it quickly decompresses, expands and absorbs heat and 
humidity from the passenger compartment as it changes state (evaporating) from liquid 
to a gas. The low side pressure is directly proportional to the evaporator temperature 
(see temp/pressure chart for R-134a) and dictates its heat exchanging capabilities. Low 
side pressures should average 28 to 32 psi, that means that the actual pressure of a vari¬ 
able piston displacement compressor/TEV system can be between 15 and 45 psi at any 
given time. 

Heat and humidity are carried away by the refrigerant gas which is then suctioned into 
the compressor where it is compressed, heated and pumped through the A/C system 
via the condenser. A flow of ambient air cools the condenser and the compressed, hot 
refrigerant gas changes state to a liquid once again, as it flows further along the con¬ 
denser. Here the hot gas condenses into a "warm” liquid as It gives away its heat. 

The high side pressure reading directly indicates the condenser cooling efficiency. 
Although High side pressures may vary between 150 to 300 lb. normally they should be 
about 2 to 2.5 times the ambient temperature. Depending on humidity, an outside tem¬ 
perature of 80°F should produce a pressure of 160 to 200 psi on the High side 
(see temperature/pressure chart for R-134a). When the High side pressure is way above 
the normal it may indicate that the condenser auxiliary cooling fan is not cooling the 
refrigerant sufficiently. Proper airflow across the condenser insures the efficiency of the 
entire system. The coolerthe refrigerant is leaving the condenserthe lower its pressure; 
consequently the lower the pressure of the refrigerant entering the evaporator the more 
heat can be absorbed from the passenger compartment. 


Note: Pressure gauges are indispensible when diagnosing A/C system BUT 
they are incapable of measuring the quantity or forthat matterthe type 
of refrigerant in the system.

A/C Performance EfficiencyTest 

Before an A/C efficiency test, satisfy the following conditions: 

• Connect the diagnostic equipment and check forfaults (no faults in the fault memory). 

• Use a thermometer with separate gauge. 

• Perform the test in a suitable work bay with an ambient temperature between 
20°C and 30°C (68°F and 86°F). 

Pre-conditions 

1. Connect BMW diagnostic equipment to the vehicle and display evaporator 
temperature. 

2. Position a (pocket) thermometer with a separate gauge about 5 cm(2 in.) below the 
roof liner at the height of the B-pillar. Lay the gauge facing outside of vehicle interior. 

3. Pleating up the vehicle interior: 

• A/C button is not activated during heating up. 

• Close all windows and doors. 

• Set recirculated air mode. 

• Select air distribution mode for footwell and defrosting. 

• Maximum temperature setting. 

• Maximum fan stage. 

• Run engine at approx. 2000 rpm until operating temperature is reached, 
then idle speed. 


21 

Air Conditioning Service and Diagnosis 




A/C Efficiency Test 

• Turn on A/C compressor at a vehicle interiortemperature of 50°C. 

• After 3-4 minutes, the evaporator sensor temperature must be 15°C (59°F) 
or below. 

If this temperature is not reached: 

• Measure the amount of refrigerant collected. 

• Recycle the refrigerant in the A/C system. 

If the recovered refrigerant quantity does not correspond to the specified fill quantity: 

• Recharge with the specified amount of refrigerant and repeat test. If fill quantity 
is correct, continue troubleshooting by pressure measurement. 

If fill quantity is correct: 

• Continue troubleshooting by refrigerant pressure readings. 


Note: For A/C systems with uncontrolled compressors only; if necessary, 
then continue troubleshooting by pressure measurement.

Service Information 


Condenser Service 

The procedure in the condenser is divided into three operations. 

In the first stage, the hot gaseous refrigerant at a temperature of about 60 tol20°C com¬ 
ing from the compressor at a pressure of 10 to 25 bar gives off its superheat to the out¬ 
side air. The actual condensation takes place in the second phase where the refrigerant 
has lost so much energy that it becomes liquid. In the third phase, further energy is taken 
from the now liquid refrigerant. This state is referred to as refrigerant sub-cooling. This 
phase also makes sure that no gas bubbles can form on the refrigerant's way to the 
expansion valve. The sub-cooling takes more heat away from the refrigerant than is nec¬ 
essary for actual condensation. The sub-cooled refrigerant in the evaporator can absorb 
a larger quantity of heat and thus increase the refrigerating capacity of the system. The 
auxiliary fan arranged directly before the condenser ensures an effective supply of cooling 
air. The refrigerant remains in the condenser at a high pressure of approx. 10-25 bar. 
Approximately 80-90% of the condenser is used in the actual condensation process 
where a temperature drop of 30 to 40°C occurs. 

The following points must be observed when working on the condenser: 

• The distance between the condenser and vehicle radiator must be as large 
as possible. 

• The condenserfins must not be bent or dirty. 

• Ensure the auxiliary fan is operating correctly. 

• A soiled condenser results in poor condensation and unnecessarily high 
operating pressures. 

Note: The sub-cooling of the refrigerant in the condenserenhances the 
efficiency of the airconditioning system. 

Evaporator Service 

The evaporator functions as a heat exchanger in that thermal energy is taken externally 
from the air and given off internally to the refrigerant. The most important factor is the 
energy absorption by the refrigerant during the transition from the liquid to the gaseous 
state. This transition requires a great deal of energy in the form of heat which is taken 
from the air blown through the system of fins. The refrigerant cools down greatly while 
the injection procedure ensures the pressure drops from 10-20 bar. to about 2 bar. The 
refrigerant is evaporated at low pressure by the heat delivered from the passenger com¬ 
partment with the use of a blowerfan. 


32 

AirConditioning Service and Diagnosis 



The following points must be observed when working on the evaporator: 

• The evaporator fins must not be dirty or bent. This would result in the growth of bac¬ 
teria and odor. 

• The evaporator fins must not ice up. If the evaporator does ice up, the fault will be in 
the area of the evaporator temperature sensor. This situation may result in compres- 
sordamage. 

• The micro filter change intervals must be maintained to insure adequate airflow. 

• The condensation water drain must not be clogged and water must drain off freely. 

• The evaporator temperature sensor must be installed correctly. 

Note: To treat bacteria and odorcomplaints, a special cleaning and treatment 
procedures must be followed. SI 64 04 03 "A/C System Musty Odor" 
can be found inTIS. 

Expansion Valve Service 

A block-valve design of expansion valve is used on current BMW A/C systems. The 
refrigerant enters at the upper right inlet. At the left of the valve there is a capillary tube 
filled with an inert gas that senses the temperature of the air coming into the housing 
from the plenum. 

When the air temperature in the plenum rises, 
the pressure in the capillary tube increases. 

This pushes down on a diaphragm and 
pushrod assembly, which increases the size 
of the orifice opening, allowing more refriger¬ 
ant into the evaporator and providing more 
cooling. 

When plenum temperature falls, the pressure 
in the capillary tube falls. The spring pushes 
up on the pushrod, making the orifice open¬ 
ing smaller; less refrigerant is allowed into the 
evaporator, allowing less cooling. 

Refrigerant from the outlet of the evaporator 
passes through the bottom left opening of the 
block valve. 



33 

Air Conditioning Service and Diagnosis 








When the pressure at the evaporator outlet is high, this increases the pressure needed by 
the capillary tube to open the valve. Less refrigerant is provided to the evaporator (to pre¬ 
vent the evaporator from being flooded). 

When pressure at the outlet end of the evaporator is lower, less pressure is exerted on the 
bottom of the diaphragm. The diaphragm pushes down on the pushrod, allowing more 
refrigerant into the evaporator. 

The following points must be observed when working on the expansion valve: 

• Very little refrigerant flow through the evaporator will result in poor AC output. 

• Too much refrigerant flow will flood the evaporator and cause possible compressor 
damage. 

• The setting of the expansion valve must not be adjusted or varied (except for 
instructions in the Service Information). 

• The expansion valve must not be repaired. 

• Seals must be replaced every time the pipes and hoses are released. 

• It is imperative that an A/C system being serviced be evacuated fora minimum of 
30 minutes or more in orderto remove any possible moisture trapped within. 

Note: If moisture gets into this system, it may freeze and clog the expansion 
valve. The A/C system mayoperatenormallyfora while, then stop cool¬ 
ing. Then, as system temperature increases, the ice melts. The system 
works again fora while, until moisture freeze-up causes it to stop again. 

Compressor Service 

The function of the compressor is to pump the refrigerant along the system. As the 
gaseous refrigerant exits the evaporator, it is pulled into the compressor by suction where 
it is compressed and superheater and then pumped along to the condenser. Liquid 
refrigerant in the compressor causes noise complaints and internal damage. There are 
currently three methods of compressor control and two types of compressors depending 
on the vehicle orequipment option. (See Compressor Operation) 

Typical compressor service points to remember: 

• When troubleshooting a noisy compressor complaint, make sure the noise is present 
only when the clutch is engaged. 

• If it is present when the clutch is not engaged, remove the compressor drive belt and 
check again. 

• If the noise continues, it is not related to the compressor. 

• If removing the drive belt reduces or eliminates the noise, check the torque of the 
compressor and bracket mounting bolts. 


34 

AirConditioning Service and Diagnosis 



• Checkthe belt tension and condition, and tensioner pullies which can produce 
rattling noises that would sound like a defective compressor. 

• A loose/slipping belt can cause noise. 

• A belt that is too tight can damage the clutch/pulley bearings. 

• If the compressor is noisy with the compressor clutch engaged, make sure the 
system is charged with the correct amount of refrigerant. 

• An over-charged system can cause compressor noise. 

• If the A/C system is overcharged, the liquid refrigerant entering the compressor 
can damage it. 

• When troubleshooting a noisy compressor complaint, recoverthe refrigerant and 
recharge the system with the correct amount. 

• A failed compressor must be returned with the inlet and outlet ports sealed using 
the plastic caps from the replacement compressor. Otherwise the "failed” compres¬ 
sor will be damaged by moisture, and it will be impossible for Warranty to analyze it. 

Compressors with plastic pullies: 

• Avoid impact on the plastic pulley (through tools, contact with base). 

• Send back damaged compressors only in original packaging. 

Note: It is importantto perform the following running-in procedure when 
operating a new compressorforthe firsttime. 

■ CompressorRunning-in Procedure 

• Switch off air conditioning system. 

• Set all air outlet nozzles on the instrument panel to "OFF". 

• Start engine and allow idle speed to stabilize. 

• Set blower capacity to min. 75% of the maximum blower capacity. 

• Switch on air conditioning and allow to run for at least 2 minutes at idle speed. Risk 
of damage at higherspeed! (Referto BMW Diagnostic Equipment Service 
Functions for more detailed instructions) 

Note: When replacing a compressoryou mustfollow the instructions on refill¬ 
ing the refrigerant oil. For details on compressor replacement and oil 
capacities are found in the Operating Fluids Information inTIS.
