AirConditioning System 


An air conditioning system does not produce cold but rather it carries heat away from the 
vehicle interiorto the outside. The closed system Is filled with a refrigerant called (R12 or 
R134a) which Is circulated and provoked to change state from a liquid to a gas and back 
again. (R134a has been introduced to replace R12 for environmental reasons.) 

The air conditioning system operates in accordance with the compression refrigerating 
principle, In which the circulating refrigerant is compressed in a gaseous state, con¬ 
densed into a liquid by dispelling heat and vaporized by rapidly reducing its pressure 
which causes it to change state to a gas once again while absorbing heat and humidity 
from the passenger compartment. 

The system Is comprised the following basic components: 

• Compressor 

• Condenser 

• Condenserfan 

• Receiver Dryer/collector 

• Expansion valve 

• Evaporator 

• Hoses and pipes 

• Regulation and control devices

The Refrigerant Cycle 

The refrigerant circuit is divided into a high pressure section (high side) and a low pres¬ 
sure section (iow side). The high pressure side is comprised of the compressor, con¬ 
denser, condenser fan, pressure sensor, receiver dryer and expansion valve. The low pres¬ 
sure side aiso involves the compressor and expansion vaive along with the evaporator and 
biowerfan.The expansion vaive separates the high-pressure side of the system from the 
iow-pressure side. Pressurized liquid refrigerant exits the receiver dryer and as it passes 
through the metered orifice of the expansion valve it decompresses and boiis. 

This change of state causes the refrigerant to absorb heat as it makes its way through the 
inside of the evaporator. The amount of refrigerant reieased is controiied by the expansion 
vaive based on evaporator temperature and pressure as weli as the temperature of the air 
passing through the evaporator and proportionai to the cooiing demand. If too little refrig¬ 
erant enters the evaporator, poor cooling results. If too much refrigerant enters, it might 
not completely boil away and liquid refrigerant might return to the compressor, causing 
damage to the system. 

The pressure and temperature are measured by passing the refrigerant through the 
expansion valve at the outlet of the evaporator. The top section of the valve measures the 
temperature of the refrigerant intake and the refrigerant pressure acts on the 
underside of the diaphragm. 

The valve controls flow of refrigerant through the evaporator as pressure and temperature 
of the gaseous refrigerant at the evaporator outlet are used to open and close the valve 
via a diaphragm. 

The flow rate is increased and decreased as air temperature at the evaporator output 
rises and falls. This control procedure runs continuously for as long as the air conditioning 
system is in operation. 

Heat is extracted from the interior as it is circulated by a blower fan through the evaporator 
outer surface area. This transfers heat from the cabin air to the vaporizing refrigerant with¬ 
in, reiterating that an air conditioning system operates by removing heat instead of adding 
cold. 

An engine driven compressor extracts the gaseous low pressure refrige rant from the 
evaporator, compresses it and heats it. The now compressed and superheater gas is 
pumped through the condenser where it cools to a high pressure liquid as outside air is 
forced through the condenserfins while driving or via the condenser cooling fan. 

The refrigerant now in a sub-cooled liquid state flows from the condenser to a liquid 
reservoir (receiver dryer) where it is collected. Any moisture and impurities are removed 
by the desiccant in the receiver dryer. This high pressure liquid now flows back into the 
low pressure side of the system, where it is forced through the expansion valve metered 
orifice back into the evaporator on its way to complete the cycle once again.

Compressors 

Compressors used in air conditioning systems operate based on various principles: 

• Reciprocating piston compressor 

• Spiral compressor 

• Vane-type compressor 

• Swash plate compressor 

The following description deals with the swash plate compressor (also known as wobbler 
compressor) as it is the most commonly used In present BMW vehicles. 

The swash plate converts the rotary motion of the drive shaft into an axial motion that 
along with a changing pivot point varies the stroke of the pistons. 

The varying piston stroke delivers a variable cylinder displacement, directly affecting and 
reacting to the A/C system pressure. 

Depending on the design, this may involve 5 to 7 pistons that are arranged in a circle 
around the drive shaft. An Intake/pressure valve is assigned to each piston, these valves 
open/close automatically In time with the operating cycle.

The design layout of the air conditioning system is set to full load. The output of the com¬ 
pressors, however, depends on the engine speed. Consequently, speed differences of up 
to 2000 rpm can occur. These fluctuations have an influence on the charge of the evapo¬ 
rator and therefore on the cooling capacity of the air conditioning system. 


Output-controlled compressors with variable displacement were developed forthe pur¬ 
pose of adapting to different engine speeds, ambient temperatures of interior tempera¬ 
tures selected by the driver. This adaptation is achieved by varying the angle of the swash 
plate. 


The swash plate is guided in longitudinal 
direction in a slide rail or runner. 

The stroke of the pistons and thus the delivery 
capacity are determined by varying the inclina¬ 
tion ofthe swash plate. 

The inclination is dependent on the chamber 
pressure and therefore on the pressure ratios 
at the top and bottom ofthe pistons. 

The inclination is supported by springs 
arranged before and after the swash plate.

Depending on application, the compressor may or may not use a magnetic clutch. In 
vehicles that use clutchless compressors they are constantly engaged when the engine 
Is running. This results In constant drag on the engine which affects emissions and fuel 
economy. 

The compressor output is always variable displacement and Is controlled Internally by 
either a mechanical control valve that operates solely on A/C pressure differential and 
does not need electronic signals or an electronic control valve that operated directly by 
signals from the IHKA control module depending on the system demand.

Electronic Control Valve 


Function 

The control valve In the compressor Is controlled Infinitely variable by the IHKA control 
unit. Depending on the ventilation temperature, outside temperature, interior temperature 
as well as the target and actual evaporator temperature, the pressure In the crankcase of 
the compressor Is varied by means of a pulse-wldth-modulated voltage signal. 

The compressor is driven by constant engagement pulley (Clutchless) and a ribbed V- 
belt.The Inclination of the swash plate changes, determining the displacement volume 
and therefore the refrigerating capacity. The compressor output capacity and therefore 
the delivery volume can be set from 0-2% minimum to 100% maximum. 

For example, the control unit (IHKA) activates the control valve accordingly when a higher 
refrigerating capacity is required. A pulse width-modulated voltage signal moves a tappet 
(plunger) In the control valve. The time the voltage is applied determines the adjustment 
range. The adjustment varies the opening cross section in the control valve between the 
high pressure and the pressure in the crankcase.

A/C System and Components 


E 70 Compressor Control 


The IHKA is the masterfor controlling the A/C compressor. Pressing the A/C button on 
the air conditioning system operating unit switches the air conditioning system to the 
ready state.! he IHKA transmits a speed increase request to the DM E (ECM). 

Depending on the temperature and the nominal-value setting, the IH KA sends a cooling 
power request to the DM E (ECM) If the DM E (ECM) is ready and in a position to provide 
torque of >20 Nm,the DME (ECM) issues a release for a load connection of up to 
BONm.This release is also monitored by the junction box.The IHKA issues a command 
to the junction box to couple the connection. The junction box returns the coupling status 
to the DME (ECM). 

The compressor output is controlled by the IHKA control unit by means of an infinitely 
variable control valve. The IHKA control command is converted into infinitely variable pro¬ 
portional powering of the control valve in the junction box. 

The evaporator temperature is controlled to a value of between 2°C and 8°C depending 
on the cooling power request. The temperature sensor signal in the evaporator is used as 
a feedback signal to the IHKA control unit. The refrigerant request is limited by the poten¬ 
tial evaporating power of the evaporator. The evaporator is prevented from icing up by 
controlling the compressor output (appropriate reduction). 

In orderto reduce CO 2 emission, avoid unstable conditions when the engine is idling and 
forfull load acceleration, the DM E can activate a compressor shut-off via the junction box. 
If appropriate parameters are present, the solenoid coupling of the compressor is opened.

Note: E70 vehicles with the N52 engine are fitted with A/C compressors with

with clutchless A/C compressors but will change to clutches later in pro¬ 
duction. This is implemented as a CO 2 emission reduction measure.

A/C System and Components 





















Compressor Drive Pullies 


Magnetic Clutch 

The magnetic clutch provides the drive connection between the compressor 
and the engine while the engine is running. 

The clutch design consists of: 

• Pulley with bearing 

• Spring plate with hub 

• Solenoid coil 

The hub of the spring plate Is securely mounted on the compressor drive shaft. 

The pulley is mounted on the outer race of the compressor drive shaft bearing. 

The solenoid coil Is connected to the compressor housing. There is a clearance "A" 
between the spring plate and pulley. 

Function 

The compressor is driven with the use of a ribbed V-belt riding on the pulley, turned by 
the engine (arrow). A voltage Is applied to the solenoid coll when the A/C Is requested. 
The resulting force from the magnetic field pulls the spring plate against the spinning pul¬ 
ley (bridging the clearance "A"), thus establishing a positive connection between the pul¬ 
ley and drive shaft of the compressor. 

The compressor is now running. It continues to operate until the power circuit to the 
solenoid coil Is Interrupted. Springs then release the spring plate from the pulley. 

The pulley runs freely without engaging the compressor shaft.

Function 

In the event the compressor ceases and the drive plate stops turning, thus increasing the 
acting forces between the pulley and the drive plate; the pulley presses on the formed 
rubber element in the direction of rotation against the locked compressor drive plate. The 
formed sections of the rubber element are sheared off thus disengaging the connection 
between the pulley and the drive plate. The pulley now continues to rotate freely. This 
prevents damage to the ribbed V-belt and therefore to the engine.

Condenser 


The condenser is made up of tube coils and fins that are firmly secured to the tubes so 
as to achieve a large heat exchange area and effective heat transmission. 

The task of the condenser is to give off the energy, which the refrigerant has taken up 
during compression in the compressor, in the form of heat to the outside air via the fins. 
As a result, the gaseous refrigerant becomes liquid again. 

The removal of energy is necessary so that when the refrigerant is injected into the evap¬ 
orator it can absorb heat energy again from the air to be cooled. 

The condenser utilizes the energy difference between the hot refrigerant underpressure 
and the cooler outside airforthe purpose of performing its task. 

Function 

The procedures in the condenser are divided into three operations. 

In the first stage, the hot gaseous refrigerant, at a temperature of approx. 60-120°C com¬ 
ing from the compressor at a pressure of 10 to 25 bar, gives off its superheat to the out¬ 
side air. 

The actual condensation takes place in the second phase where the refrigerant has lost 
so much energy that it becomes liquid. 

In the third phase, further energy is taken from the now liquid refrigerant. This state is 
referred to as refrigerant sub-cooling. This phase also makes sure that no gas bubbles 
can form on the refrigerant's way to the expansion valve. The sub-cooling takes more 
heat away from the refrigerant than is necessary for actual condensation. 

The sub-cooled refrigerant in the evaporator can absorb a larger quantity of heat and thus 
increase the refrigerating capacity of the system. 

The auxiliary fan arranged directly before the condenser ensures an effective supply of 
cooling air. The refrigerant remains in the condenser at a high pressure of approx. 10-25 
bar. Approx. 80-90% of the condenser power is used in the actual condensation process 
where a temperature drop of 30 to 40°C occur. 

Note: The greaterthe sub-cooling of the refrigerant in the condenserthe 
greaterthe refrigerating capacity of the air conditioning system.

Service Information 

• The distance between the condenser and vehicle radiator must be as large 
as possible. 

• The condenserfins must not be bent or dirty. 

• Ensure the auxiliary fan is operating correctly. 

• A soiled condenser results in poor condensation and unnecessarily high 
operating pressures.

Condenser Module 


In the past, the high pressure section of the refrigerant circuit was made up of a series of 
individual components such as the condenser with mounting bracket and connections, 
separateiy mounted liquid reservoir with fiiterand dryer, pressure sensor etc. 

As the resuit of the system integration to form the condenser moduie with flat tubular 
condenser, the liquid reservoir (dryer) was mounted on the side of the condenser. 

The condenser is divided in two cooiing sections. Inside the top 2/3 of the condenserthe 
hot, compressed gaseous refrigerant changes into a iiquid as itcoois. It enters the receiv¬ 
er dryerthrough iniethoies located at the lower 1/3 ofthe condenser cooling area. After 
passing through the desiccant in the dryerthe liquid refrigerant now enters the con¬ 
denser again and circulates through the lower 1/3 section on its way to the expansion 
valve. It is now considered a SUB-COOLED liquid.

The condenser module introduced in the E53 features an integrated filter element with 
woven plastic fabric. A further advantage is the increase in condenser capacity by more 
effective sub-cooiing of the refrigerant. Consequently, the refrigerating capacity remains 
constant even as the charge volume decreases to 50% of the normal quantity. 

The fiiter/dryer cartridge can be changed by undoing a screw piug.The refrigerant is 
dried by a bag containing a moiecularfiiter desiccant made from siiica gei. 


Note: The condenser module with 

replaceable cartridge dryer ele¬ 
ment is installed in E53, E6X, 
E70,and E9X models.. 



Receiver Dryer 

The iiquid reservoir serves as an expansion and supply reservoir for the refrigerant. Due to 
varying operating conditions such as thermal load at the evaporator and condenser as 
well as the compressor speed, varying quantities of the refrigerant are pumped through 
the circuit. A iiquid reservoir is installed for the purpose of balancing out these fluctuations 
as it absorbs moisture. 

The iiquid refrigerant coming from the condenser is collected in the reservoir and oniythe 
quantity that is required in the evaporator for cooling the airflows further. The drying 
agent can chemicaiiy bind a smaii quantity of water thus removing it from the circuit. 

Depending on the version, the desiccant can absorb 6-12g (0 .2-0.4oz) of water. The 
absorption rate is dependent on the temperature. The absorption rate increases as the 
temperature decreases. Forexampie, if a dryer is saturated at a temperature of40°C 
(104°F), it will expel water again at 60°C (140°F). Debris from the compressor, dirt and 
simiiar mater are also filtered out. 


Note: On systems that use conventional dryers, these dryer are non 
serviceable and must be replaced (E83, E85, E86)

Function 

The refrigerant enters the liquid reservoir from above and flows downward along the 
inside of the housing. It must then pass through the filter dryer where moisture is extract¬ 
ed. The refrigerant rises through a plastic screen filter in the dryer and impurities are fil¬ 
tered out. 

The filter element can be compared to a sponge which can absorb and bind water. 
Molecularfilters and silica gel bind moisture and in addition moisture activated aluminum 
oxide is used to bind acid. 

The dryer is integrated in the condenser in the new air conditioning systems as installed 
in the E53, E6X, E70, and E9X models. 

It is therefore no longer a separate component (see condenser module). 


Service Information 

The following points must be observed when working on the liquid reservoir (dryer): 

• The dryer bottle orthe dryer insert in an operative air conditioning system with no 
leaks need not be replaced at regular inspection intervals. 

• However, the dryer bottle orthe dryer element must be replaced in the case of: 

- Contamination of the refrigerant circuit through metal chips (compressor). 

- Leaks in the air conditioning system or loss of refrigerant. 

- The refrigerant circuit being opened forlongerthan 24 hours, during a repair 
procedure. 

- Priorto installation, keep the dryer (or dryer element) closed for as long as 
possible to ensure no moisture is absorbed from the ambient air. 


23 

A/C System and Components 



Condenser Fan (Auxiliary Fan) 

The auxiliary fan is used to cool the outer surface of the condenser and consequently the 
hot gaseous refrigerant that flows through it. As the refrigerant cools, it condenses back 
into liquid state. 

The engine management computer communicates with the fan control module which 
governs the auxiliary fan operation. 

The fan is activated based on the following conditions: 

• The radiator outlet temperature exceeds a preset temperature. 

• The refrigerant pressures reach a predetermined crucial point. 

• Vehicle Speed 

• Battery Voltage Level 



Auxiliary Fan C ircuit (Early Models) 

The condenser on BMW A/C systems is equipped with an auxiliary fan the provides addi¬ 
tional airflow through the radiator and condenser, when needed. 

Auxiliary fan control systems vary between vehicles. The following is a typical example of 
how the auxiliary fan is controlled. 

The auxiliary fan is controlled by two normally open relays, a normal speed relay, which 
runs the fan at the "normal" (low) speed; and a high speed relay which runs the fan at the 
high speed. 


24 

A/C System and Components 





The A/C control nnodule grounds the normal speed relay whenever the A/C system is 
turned on. This causes the fan to run at normal speed. 

The relays are also energized by a (normally open) double temperature switch, which 
senses coolant temperature In the radiator. When coolant temperature rises above 180°F 
(82°C), the normal speed half of the switch closes, powering the normal speed relay, and 
the auxiliary fan runs at normal speed, whether or not the snowflake button Is pressed. 
When the temperature rises above 190°F (88°C), the high speed half of the switch clos¬ 
es, powering the high speed relay, and the auxiliary fan runs at high speed. 

There Is also an intermediate pressure switch fitted in the receiver/dryer.This switch 
which is normally open, closes when the refrigerant pressure exceeds 260 psI.Thls ener¬ 
gizes the high speed relay and runs the auxiliary fan at high speed. 


Refrigerant Pressure-fan Stage Conversion Table 

The pressure sensor receives a 5 volt power supply 
from the IHKA control unit. The sensor signal Is evaluat¬ 
ed and forwarded to the DM E via the K-Bus. In the 
process, the refrigerant pressure in the air-conditioning 
circuit is converted to a load torque and calculation for 
the required fan speed (stage). 

Each fan stage that is determined is transmitted from 
the ECM to the auxiliary fan output stage. Prerequisite 
is a speed less than 50 mph. 


Note: BMW auxiliary fan operation and strategy 
varies within vehicles. Referto the 
Electrical Troubleshooting Manuals (ETM) 
forvehicle specific information.

A/C System and Components 




Thermostatic Expansion Valve (TEV) 

The thermostatic expansion valve (TEV) regulates the flow of refrigerant through the 
evaporator depending on the degree of so called "overheating" of the refrigerant vapor at 
the evaporator outlet. The amount of refrigerant that can evaporate under the respective 
operating conditions is fed to the evaporator via the TEV. As one of the separating points 
between the high-pressure and low-pressure sections, the TEV is installed In the refriger¬ 
ant circuit ahead of the evaporator. 

The flow of refrigerant through the expansion valve is controlled depending on tempera¬ 
ture and pressure in order to achieve optimum refrigerating capacity in the evaporator. 
This metering system ensures the entire heat exchange area is utilized efficiently as pres¬ 
surized liquid refrigerant expands in the evaporator and absorbs heat from the passenger 
compartment. 

Function 

The pressure and temperature are measured by passing the refrigerant through the 
expansion valve at the outlet of the evaporator. The top section of the TEV measures the 
temperature of the refrigerant intake and the refrigerant pressure acts on the underside of 
the diaphragm. 

The valve needle is pressed down against a spring to open the valve, allowing liquid 
refrigerantto flow into the evaporator.The refrigerant evaporates, pressure and tempera¬ 
ture drop. The pressure and temperature of the gaseous refrigerant at the evaporator out¬ 
let are used to open and close the valve via a diaphragm. 

When the air temperature at the evaporator outlet drops, the sensing gas in the 
diaphragm chamber contracts, this moves the valve needle upward and reduces the 
coolant flow rate to the evaporator. 

The flow rate Is Increased again when the airtemperature at the evaporator output rises. 
Increasing pressure at the evaporator outlet assists the valve closing action. Decreasing 
pressure assists the valve opening action. This control procedure runs continuously for as 
long as the air conditioning system is in operation. 

The following points must be observed when working on the expansion valve: 

• Very little refrigerant flow through the evaporator will result In poor A/C output. 

• If too much refrigerant flows Into the evaporator, it will flood and cause possible 
compressor damage. 

• The setting of the expansion valve must not be adjusted or varied 
(except for instructions in the Service Information). 

• The expansion valve must not be repaired. 

• Seals must be replaced every time the pipes and hoses are released.

The evaporator is installed in the housing of the integrated automatic heating and air con¬ 
ditioning system (IHKA)orthe integrated heating and air conditioning control (IHKR). It 
consists of a coiled tube with press-fitted fins. The refrigerant flows through the coiled 
tube. The blower blows the air to be cooled through the fins. To improve heat transmis¬ 
sion, the fins are designed so that they cover a large surface area. 

In orderto uniformly supply the entire area of the evaporator with liquid refrigerant, the 
refrigerant is divided into several subsections of equal size after being injected into the 
evaporator. 

This design layout greatly increases the efficiency of the evaporator. The divided refriger¬ 
ant channels are reunited at the end of the coiled tube where they are drawn in by the 
compressor.

Like the condenser, the evaporator is also a heat exchanger. It is responsible for the main 
task of the air conditioning system, extracting heat from the passenger compartment. 

A further task of the evaporator is to dry the air by removing moisture. The condensed 
moisture is expelled to the outside of the vehicle. Air dried in this way assists in keeping 
the windscreen and windows free of condensation. 

Function 

The evaporator functions as a heat exchanger in that thermal energy is taken externally 
from the air and given off internally to the refrigerant. The most important factor is the 
energy absorption by the refrigerant during the transition from the liquid to the gaseous 
state. This transition requires a great deal of energy in the form of heat which is taken 
from the air blown through the system of fins. The refrigerant is evaporated at low pres¬ 
sure and by the heat delivered from the passenger compartment by the use of a blower 
fan. The refrigerant cools down greatly while the injection procedure ensures the pres¬ 
sure drops from 10-20 barto approx. 2 bar. 

Service Information 

The following points must be observed when working on the evaporator: 

• The evaporator fins must not be dirty or bent. This would result in the growth of bac¬ 
teria and odor. 

• The evaporator fins must not ice up. If the evaporator does ice up, the fault will be in 
the area ofthe evaporator temperature sensor.This situation would result in com¬ 
pressordamagefollowing a longer period of operation ofthe air conditioning system. 

• The micro filter change intervals must be maintained to insure adequate airflow. 

• The condensation water drain must not be clogged and water must drain off freely. 

• The evaporator temperature sensor must be installed correctly. 


Note: To treat bacteria and odor complaints, a special cleaning and treatment 
procedures must be followed. SI 64 04 03 "A/C System Musty Odor” can 
be found inTIS.

Hoses and Pipes 

The system of hoses and pipes serves the purpose of establishing the connection 
between the individual components of the air conditioning system. The connections are 
sealed with 0-rings. 

The hoses and pipes consist of various materials, different shapes and sizes. A fold, 
flange or threaded connection is provided at the end of each line. 

To date, vehicle air conditioning systems were equipped with flexible hose lines. More 
recently, aluminum pipes and combinations of aluminum pipes and hose lines have also 
been used for space-saving purposes. 

The hose material Is an elastomer formed from various rubber layers. The Inside is com¬ 
patible with the refrigerant and the refrigerator oil. 

The outside Is compatible with weather influences, oils, fuels and other substances used 
In the vehicle. 

In addition, these rubber layers must also be Impermeable to the refrigerant and the 
refrigerator oil of the compressor (from the Inside) and to moisture (from the outside). 

The refrigerant R134a has smaller molecules than R12 and could therefore more easily 
penetrate the rubber layers of the hoses. 

Thanks to the use of an additional nylon sheathing and a maximum of two inner rein¬ 
forcements made from woven textile, hose lines are now available that are suitable for use 
In R134a air conditioning systems.
