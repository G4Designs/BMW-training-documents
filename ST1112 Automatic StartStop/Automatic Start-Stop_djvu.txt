Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 


Introduction 


The Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) system was first introduced on European E8x, E9x 
vehicles in conjunction with manual transmission and four-cylinder engines. 

It is one more BMW Efficient Dynamics measure aimed at meeting the voluntary com¬ 
mitment of reducing C02 emissions while enhancing fuel economy. 

The MSA system lowers fuel consumption and emissions by automatically switching the 
engine off when the car is stationary. The engine is subseguently restarted automatically 
as well, as soon as the appropriate conditions for restarting are satisfied. 

Although the F04 ActiveHybrid 7 uses the MSA function it was never offered in the US 
in a non hybrid model until its introduction on the E90 M3 (MT and DCT) in 9/2010. 

With the introduction of the E89 Z4 sDrive28i (MT) and FI 0 528i in September 2011 to 
the US market MSA has been offered as standard eguipment. This coincideds with the 
US launch of the N20 4 cylinder engines in these models. 

The FI 0 535i and FI 2 640i with the N55 engine are also available with MSA as stan¬ 
dard eguipment at this time. 

While MSA I is installed in BN2000 models Fxx vehicles use the second generation of 
MSA (MSA II) which has been further developed to operate in combination with auto¬ 
matic transmissions and the BN2020 electrical system. 

Note: The following section describes the basic operation of MSA I on 

BN2000 vehicles. This material serves as reference information for the 
MSA II system on BN2020 vehicles as both systems share components 
and functions. See the MSA II section for more information regarding 
updated features and functions. 

System Overview 

The Automatic Start/Stop function is integrated in the engine management (DME). The 
MSA function makes use of a variety of existing data from the bus system. Various sen¬ 
sors are also reguired for proper functioning of the system. The input/output diagram in 
the “System Overview Section” provides a general view of the most important input and 
output signals.

Preconditions 

The MSA function can only be performed under certain conditions. 

The engine is switched off if: 

• the vehicle is stationary (speed below 3 kph/2 mph) 

• the vehicle has been driven at over >5 kph/3 mph since the last time the engine 
was stopped 

• the vehicle has been driven at over >5 kph/3 mph since the last time terminal 15 
was switched over 

• the manual gearbox is in neutral 

• the clutch pedal is not depressed 

• the steering wheel is not being turned 

• the engine speed is approximately idling speed 
The engine is restarted in response to driver action if: 

• the gearbox is in neutral (see section on neutral position sensor) and the clutch 
pedal is depressed (10%) 

• the gear lever is in the extended neutral zone (see section on neutral position sen¬ 
sor) and the clutch pedal is depressed (90%) 

The engine is restarted without action by the driver (only if switched off by MSA if: 

• the vehicle starts rolling (5 kph/3 mph forwards or backwards) 

• the brake system pressure falls below a defined threshold 

• the battery charge level falls below a defined threshold 

• the misting sensor detects misting on the windshield (IHKA) 

• the evaporator temperature exceeds a certain threshold while the air-conditioning 
compressor is switched on 

The basic condition for restarting the engine is that the manual gearbox is in neutral. 

A precise description of all the conditions and exceptions that determine whether or not 
the MSA can operate is provided in the section "Stop inhibitors and start enablers". 

External conditions such as the outside temperature (MSA only operates at temperatures 
< +3 °C/37.4 °F) can result in the MSA function being unavailable for extended periods. 
The MSA function is always activated when the engine is not running, terminal 15 is 
switched on and a so-called "driving cycle" is initiated. The MSA can be switched off by 
means of the MSA button. The MSA is automatically switched on again the next time a 
driving cycle is initiated.

• Brake pedal is released 

• Accelerator pedal is 
pressed at same time 
the brake pedal is

• Stop-and-go traffic 

• Brake pedal is released shortly 
after coming to a full stop 


Note: On the M3 with the M DCT the clutch sensor is not monitored by MSA to 
start and shut down the engine. Instead the DME looks at brake pressure 
for this purpose. 

Note: For information regarding the MSA System on Automatic vehicles refer 
to the MSA II section of this training material.

Principles of Operation 


System Function 

Provided all the preconditions are satisfied, the MSA functions as follows: 



Vehicle is moving... Gear is engaged... Engine is running... 

Accelerator is depressed... Instrument cluster shows 

time and temperature. 



Driver brakes until vehicle 
comes to a stop... 


Driver puts the gearbox in 
neutral... 

and releases the clutch 
pedal... 


Engine stops... 

The instrument cluster 
shows the "Start/Stop" 
symbol.

drive off.. 


The "Start/Stop" symbol 
disappears and time and 
temperature reappear. 


Stop inhibitors and start enablers 

The MSA function has to be suppressed under certain conditions. The engine then con¬ 
tinues running even though the gear lever is in the neutral position and the clutch pedal 
has been fully released. Example: stop inhibitor 



Driver brakes until the vehi¬ 
cle comes to a stop... 


Driver puts the gearbox in 
neutral... 

and releases the clutch 
pedal... 


Engine continues running... 

A stop inhibitor is present 
and the instrument cluster 
displays the appropriate 
symbol. 


14 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 














































Conversely, there are also situations in which the engine must be started even though the 
driver takes no active steps (e.g. pressing the Start/Stop button or depressing the clutch). 

Note: We must point out that start enablers are conditions that require the 
engine to start automatically, without action by driver. And start 
inhibitors are conditions that do not allow the engine to stop. 

The following are possible stop inhibitors and start enablers: 

• Engine conditioning (stop inhibitor only) 

• Battery status 

• Electrical system power demand 

• Climate control requirements 

• Inadequate brake servo vacuum 

• Inadequate power steering assistance (stop inhibitor only) 

• Various safety requirements (reverse gear engaged, 
steering wheel movement and deceleration) 

• Vehicle starting to roll 


Engine conditioning 

In addition to its primary function of providing the motive power for the vehicle, the engine 
also has to perform a number of ancillary functions. These functions are necessary for 
operational reliability, comfort/convenience and exhaust emissions compliance. 

The following conditions prevent the engine from being switched off: 

• Engine-coolant temperature below a certain level 
(dependent on engine model, approx. 20 - 50 °C/68 - 122 °F) 

• Activated charcoal filter must have been purged 

• Engine not running at idling speed i.e. > 900 rpm. 


Alternator capacity utilization 

Reduced alternator output capacity or a high level of power demand from the electrical 
system (I > 60 A) as an average immediately before the point at which the engine would 
be switched off and which can but must not be reduced or switched off by the APM 
results in a stop inhibitor. 


15 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 



Battery status 

The battery status is a fundamental factor affecting the existence of stop-inhibiting and 
start-enabling conditions. Computation of the battery status is performed by the 
Advanced Power Management (APM). That function is integrated in the engine manage¬ 
ment (see Energy management) and has been extended specifically for the MSA. 

The aim is to ensure reliable engine starting from an electrical system viewpoint after the 
engine has not been running for a defined period. Before the engine is switched off, a 
reliable prediction of the minimum absolute remaining usable capacity and the minimum 
voltage level when subsequently restarting the engine from warm is made. 

The APM calculates the status of the electrical system on the basis of the following data: 

• Battery status 

- Charge level too low 

- Charge level implausible 

- Battery temperature too high 

- Starting voltage dip too low on previous MSA start 

• Power demand from electrical equipment in use 

The result can be either prevention or requirement of MSA function. 

The following information may be signalled: 

• Stop-inhibiting condition 

• Start-enabling condition 

The MSA responds to battery charge level in the following manner:

3 

In the red zone, the engine is started 


Note: If the battery charge level drops into the red zone after the MSA has 
switched the engine off, the MSA restarts the engine. 


16 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 












Climate control requirements 
Heating mode 

If the engine coolant temperature is significantly below the required temperature for 
heater fan operation, this is treated as a stop inhibitor. In heating mode (while the engine 
is not running) the electric auxiliary water pump or main electric water pump is activated. 
The demand is signalled by the climate control panel via the bus system. 

Air-conditioning mode 

In certain situations it is necessary to ensure that the air conditioning compressor 
continues to provide cooling capacity so as to dehumidify and lower the temperature in 
the vehicle’s interior. 

Depending on equipment the following stop inhibitors may apply: 

• Automatic air conditioning: MAX AC button pressed 

• Air conditioning: high fan setting and low fan output temperature and compressor 
button pressed. 

The MSA system has to be inhibited if there is a demand for windshield defrosting. 
Depending on equipment this is detected by: 

• Automatic air conditioning: 

Defrost button pressed and compressor activated 

• Air conditioning: 

High fan setting and airflow directed onto windshield and compressor activated 

If the misting sensor signal indicates that the windshield is misting, MSA is inhibited if the 
air conditioning is switched on (stop-inhibiting condition). If this occurs when the engine 
is switched off, a start command is issued. 

If the evaporator temperature rises above a defined threshold when the engine has been 
switched off by the MSA and the air conditioning is on, this constitutes a start enabling 
condition which will prompt the engine to start automatically. 

If the evaporator temperature is above a defined threshold when the air conditioning is on, 
this constitutes a stop-inhibiting or start enabling condition. 

If the engine has been switched off by the MSA, a less comfortable interior climate may 
result (dampness/odor). 

Note: For further information regarding climate control refer to the MSA II 
System Components section of this training material. 


17 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 



Inadequate brake servo vacuum 

In order to ensure there is always sufficient braking power (even when the engine is 
switched off) the vacuum in the brake servo has to be continuously monitored. 

If reguired, the engine is automatically restarted, i.e. if the vacuum drops below 500 hPa 
(0.5 Bar) while the engine has been stopped by MSA. 

Power steering 

Regardless of the power steering used (EPS or hydraulic) the engine can not be switched 
off as long as the steering wheel is being turned. In such situations, there must always be 
power steering assistance available. The MSA system detects steering wheel movement 
based on the signals from the steering column switch cluster (via the bus system) to 
determine if the engine can be switched off. 

Safety requirements 

If the hood is opened, the MSA is deactivated in order to prevent the engine being start¬ 
ed automatically when work is being carried out in the engine compartment. The engine 
compartment lid contact switch is monitored for this purpose. It is always possible to start 
the engine with the Start/Stop button. 

Reactivation of the MSA is possible once the hood has been closed and either the 
engine has been started or the vehicle speed has reached 5 kph/3 mph. 

If the driver gets out of the vehicle, the MSA is deactivated in order to prevent the engine 
being started automatically. 

The driver's seatbelt buckle is monitored for that purpose. 

• If the driver's seatbelt buckle is unfastened, the MSA is deactivated. The engine can 
not be switched off by the MSA until the seatbelt buckle is fastened again and the 
vehicle has reached a speed of > 5 kph/3 mph once (stop inhibitor only). 


The engine may be started despite the seatbelt being 
unfastened and the hood being open if the vehicle speed 
exceeds 5 kph/3 mph. 



• If an automatic start demand is issued, a CC message is generated. 

• Reactivation of the MSA is possible once the driver's seatbelt has been fastened 
and either the engine has been started or the vehicle speed has reached 

5 kph/3 mph. 

The signal indicating the status of the seatbelt-buckle switch is provided by the safety 
system via the bus system. 


18 


Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 




Preventing the engine being switched off if the vehicle is moving 

On no account must the engine be switched off if the vehicle is moving. The engine can 
not be switched off until the vehicle speed is below 3 kph/2 mph. 

Preventing automatic engine starting when a gear is engaged 

If a gear is engaged on a vehicle with manual transmission, automatic engine starting 
must be prevented. 

Detection of when the drive is disengaged is performed by means of the gearbox neutral 
position sensor. 

System-related deactivation 

The MSA can also be deactivated for system related reasons. A CC message is dis¬ 
played to the driver on the instrument cluster if a start request is received. 

The following deactivators can be responsible for system-related deactivation: 

• Seatbelt-buckle signal 

• Hood contact switch 

• Engine emergency mode 

• Implausible sensor or bus signals 

• Vehicle being towed 

• Key not detected (Comfort Access)

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 























Response to deactivation by a safety function 

If the MSA is deactivated by a safety function after the engine has been switched off by 
the MSA, the engine can only be restarted by the Start/Stop button and if the road speed 
exceeds 5 kph/3 mph. 

Response to deactivation by system faults (emergency mode concept) 

If a fault in the MSA system complex (signal inputs, actuator systems, bus signals ...) 
is detected, a stop inhibitor is set or the MSA deactivated. 

Thus, detection of a fault while the engine is running prevents the MSA subsequently 
switching the engine off at any time. If the engine detects a fault after it has been 
switched off by the MSA, the following scenarios are distinguished: 

1. If a safety-related fault is detected (fault on neutral-position sensor, brake servo vac¬ 
uum sensor, clutch sensor, enable signal line, hood switch or driver's seatbelt-buckle 
switch), the MSA is immediately deactivated and automatic restarting of the engine 
is no longer possible. 

2. If other types of fault are detected (DME emergency mode, etc.) which are not safe¬ 
ty-critical, the MSA is allowed to start the engine once more. Subsequently, however, 
the MSA is no longer permitted to switch the engine off. 

3. If faults in bus communication with the DME engine management module are 
encountered, the MSA is deactivated. 



If the MSA is deactivated due to a system fault, the 
instrument cluster displays a CC message (ID397). 

Instruction as to further action required (take car to 
dealer) ID397. 


Deactivation due to external conditions 



If the seatbelt is unfastened or the hood opened after 
the engine has been switched off by the MSA, the 
MSA is deactivated and the engine can only be 
restarted by the Start/Stop button or if the road speed 
exceeds 5 kph/3 mph. If the driver attempts to start 
the car by depressing the clutch, CC message ID450 
is displayed after 1 -2 seconds. 


20 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 





Signal path in electrical system 

The Car Access System (CAS) is only a subordinate control unit in this situation and 
does not perform any calculations of its own regarding automatic engine starting. 

The information for engine starting clearance is transmitted via the bus system in 
the first instance: 

• DME 

• PT-CAN 

• Junction-box 

• K-CAN 

• CAS 



K-CAN 



DME/DDE 


MSA 



In addition, clearance for starting is also signalled via a separate line. The CAS compares 
the two signals. If the time lag between the two signals exceeds a certain limit, the MSA 
is not allowed to start the engine. A fault memory entry is registered. 


21 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 











Deactivation by MSA button 

The MSA function can be manually deactivated by means of the MSA button, in which 
case the LED in the button lights up. 

Every time the engine is restarted, the MSA function is reactivated.

Energy management 

Availability when engine switched off by MSA 

When the engine has been switched off by the MSA, excessive power consumption must 
be avoided. Therefore, all large consumers of electricity are switched off, or their con¬ 
sumption reduced. The displays remain active. 

The following are switched off: 

• Rear window heater 

• Mirror heaters 

• Seat heaters 

The following are adjusted to the situation: 

• Heater fan 

The automatic climate control (IHKA) is responsible for adjusting the heater fan. 

Availability while engine is started by MSA 

There are restrictions to the following functions while the engine is being started by the 
MSA: 

• Power windows 

• Windshield wipers 

• Sliding sunroof 

• Interior and exterior lights 

After the engine has been started, automatic sequences are continued. 

If the power windows or sunroof are in the middle of an automatic sequence when the 
engine is started, the sequence is interrupted. 

Once the engine has been started, the automatic sequence is continued. The windshield 
wipers are also briefly halted while the engine is started. 

Multimedia, CD or radio playback is not restricted in anyway. 


23 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 



System Components 


As already mentioned in the system overview, the MSA function involves a complex sys¬ 
tem of interactions across the entire bus system. However, the information required is 
provided by existing signals from other systems. 

The following components are necessary for the MSA: 

• System's own sensors 

- Brake servo vacuum sensor 

- Manual gearbox neutral position sensor 

- MSA button 

• External sensors, e.g. 

- Clutch switch 

- Hood contact switch 

- Seatbelt-buckle switch (driver) 


Brake Servo Vacuum Sensor 


Vacuum sensor 


In order to ensure that there is sufficient vacu¬ 
um for brake servo assistance at all times, the 
brake servo is fitted with a vacuum sensor. 

The brake servo vacuum sensor is located next 
to the brake servo and is connected via a sep¬ 
arate lead. 


Voltage proportional to vacuum 



urn 



The brake servo vacuum sensor supplies volt¬ 
age signals proportional to the vacuum pre¬ 
sent (see graph). 


Note: If there is insufficient vacuum, the 
MSA starts the engine even with¬ 
out action by the driver. 


24 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 






Manual Gearbox Neutral Position Sensor 

The neutral position sensor is mounted on 
top of the gearbox housing and its purpose 
is to detect when the gear lever is in the 
neutral position. The neutral position sensor 
is a PLCD (permanent-magnet linear con¬ 
tactless displacement) sensor.

Moving the gear lever moves the gear-shift linkage rod and, therefore, the magnet. 

The DME is able to detect the position of the gear lever by means of the PLCD sensor. 


The following distinctions have to be made for the purposes of the MSA function: 

• Gear engaged - MSA function disabled 

• Gear lever in neutral position - MSA starts engine if clutch is depressed by 10% 

• Gear lever moved slightly out of neutral position - engine is started if clutch 
depressed by 90%

The learning sequence (orange) is necessary to compensate for tolerances in the 
mechanical and electrical systems. 

The DME then calculates the maximum ranges relative to the learned gear-lever neutral 
position within which the engine can be started if the clutch is depressed. 

When the clutch is fully depressed, the engine can still be started when the gear lever is 
deflected by up to 1.89 mm (10% PWM). 

The PLCD sensor is provided with a 5 V power supply. The output voltage is a PWM 
signal whose pulse duty factor changes according to the position of the gear lever 
(10-90%). 

The neutral position sensor has to complete a learning phase. If the DME is replaced, the 
learned data can be copied by reading the learned position using the diagnosis system 
(provided the old DME can be read) before the unit is replaced and then writing it to the 
new unit. 

The learning sequence is described in the BMW diagnosis system.

MSA Button 


In all models, except the E90 M3, the MSA button is used to deactivate the MSA system. 
If the terminal 15 signal changes to on when the engine is not running or if the MSA but¬ 
ton is pressed again, the MSA is reactivated.

The signal from the MSA button is received by the IHKA and passed on to the engine 
management. The indicator lamp is controlled by the IHKA. 

Note: In the E90 M3 the MSA system is OFF by default and is activated by 
pressing the button in the center console.

The existing clutch switch signal is used as an input variable for the MSA. 

Two statuses are registered: 

• 10% clutch pedal depression 

• 90% clutch pedal depression 

Note: In the M3 the clutch sensor signal is not monitored in the M DCT trans¬ 
mission for the MSA function. Instead the DME monitors brake pressure 
to determine when to start the engine as the driver wishes to drive off.

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 







Hood Contact Switch 

The hood contact switch signal is taken into 
account as a determining factor in the MSA calcu¬ 
lations. If the hood is open, the engine must not be 
started or stopped by the MSA for safety reasons. 


Note: If the hood switch is defective 
(continuously signals "open"), 
all MSA functions are suppressed. 



CAUTION!!! 


If the top of the hood switch is covered over (workshop 
mode), it signals "Switch closed". The MSA function is 
active. Caution: the engine may start automatically. 


Seatbelt-buckle Switch 

The seatbelt-buckle switch enables the MSA to 
detect if the driver's seatbelt is fastened. If the dri¬ 
ver's seatbelt is not fastened, the MSA responds in 
different ways depending on the vehicle status. 

• If the engine is running, a stop inhibitor is set 

• If the engine has been switched off by the 
MSA, the MSA is deactivated. The engine can 
only be restarted by means of the Start/Stop 
button. 



Actuators 

The MSA indirectly operates the starter motor and indicator lamps/CC or display mes¬ 
sages on the instrument cluster.

With the MSA, the starter motor has significantly more work to do. Therefore, it has been 
designed for substantially more (approx. 8 times as many) starting cycles. 

The components of the starter motor have been adapted to the higher demands 
(see legend). 


29 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 





















Alternator 


Due to battery discharge while the engine has 
been switched off by the MSA, a more powerful 
alternator is fitted. 



Battery 

The MSA always comes together with intelligent alternator control (IGR). Due to the sub¬ 
stantially more freguent charging and discharging cycles, the load on the battery is very 
high. AGM batteries provide the possibility of achieving a similar service life despite the 
high loadings because they have a higher recharging capacity. 

AGM batteries with a minimum capacity of 90 Ah are fitted, depending on the vehicle and 
eguipment levels. 



30 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 


As of the introduction of the F10, the intelligent battery sensor IBS is used to improve the 
battery condition detection. In BN2020 vehicles the following criteria are used to estab¬ 
lish whether or not the battery is defective and needs to be replaced: 

• Identification of faulty battery cells in the vehicle battery 

• Establishing the remaining capacity of the vehicle battery 

• Battery water loss detected 

• Long immobilization period with low state of charge 

• Charge capacity 

• Charge balance when the vehicle is at a standstill 

• Charge balance when the vehicle is moving 

• Lowest permitted discharging 

• Discharge via the automatic start/stop function (MSA). 

These criteria are recorded using the measured values obtained from the intelligent bat¬ 
tery sensor and other measured variables of the voltage supply. Only specific criteria may 
be used to determine the battery condition, depending on the powertrain and eguipment 
used in the vehicle. 

The battery condition detection determines whether the battery needs to be replaced 
based on the severity and number of defects detected. Furthermore, the vehicle user is 
notified via the "Check power supply" check control message that a problem may exist. 
The fault entry can only be deleted once the vehicle battery change service function has 
been carried out. 

The condition of the battery can be read out in Service via the "battery condition" or 
"energy diagnosis" procedures ("General information “battery" menu) in order to deter¬ 
mine whether it needs to be replaced. 


Indicator Lamp 


There are a number of new indications that provide feedback from the MSA for the driver. 


The possible MSA indications are detailed in the next chapter. 



31 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 




Indication concept 

The following indications are used in conjunction with the MSA: 

If the engine can be started by the MSA, that status is continuously 
indicated on the instrument cluster. If the driver wants to see the time 
and temperature, the indication can be suppressed by pressing the 
computer roller. 



if there is a fault on the MSA hardware that causes the MSA to be 
deactivated, a CC message is displayed. 

Text of CC message: "Automatic start/stop has failed." 



If the MSA is deactivated to ensure functional safety ("Seatbelt buckle 
unfastened"), another CC message is displayed as soon as a start 
compeller is present: 

Text: "Automatic start/stop deactivated." 



Electrical system stabilization 

As a result of the substantially more frequent starting cycles, there are correspondingly 
more voltage dips in the electrical system due to the electrical load. 

In order to stabilize the supply voltage for particularly voltage-sensitive electrical compo¬ 
nents and thereby protect them, a DC/DC converter is used in conjunction with the MSA. 

The DC/DC converter supplies the terminal 30g_DC/DC and terminal 30g_f_DC/DC 
relays with a constant voltage even during a starting cycle. 

The DC/DC converter requires the following control signals: 

• Terminal 50 

• Terminal 15 

• Terminal 30g 

• Terminal 30g_f ON 

• Terminal 30g_f OFF 


32 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 





The terminal 50 signal is provided by the CAS, the terminal 15 and terminal 30g signals 
by the junction-box control unit. 

The DC/DC converter has a diagnosis output (PWM signal) that provides the following 
coded information: 

• Converter OK 

• Converter defective 

• Converter overheated 

The diagnosis lead is read and analyzed by the JB. 

The DC/DC control unit is located in the electronics box in the engine compartment. 

The DC/DC control unit contains the electronic circuitry for converting the voltage and the 
terminal 30g_f_DC/DC and terminal 30g_DC/DC relays. 



In addition to terminals 30g_DC/DC and 30g_f_DC/DC, the terminals 30g and 30g_f, and 
therefore the terminal relays, are retained. 


33 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 























































Terminal management 

Voltage-sensitive electrical components are supplied with a matched voltage when nec¬ 
essary. That supply is only provided under certain conditions (starting cycle and voltage 
below 10.5 V). Otherwise, the connected control units are supplied with the normal elec¬ 
trical system power supply diverted through the DC/DC converter.

The DC/DC module uses the input voltage testing leads and terminal 50 to decide 
whether to supply the DC/DC terminals via the bypass or the DC/DC converter. 

The relays 30g_DC/DC and 30g_f_DC/DC are also accommodated in the DC/DC 
control unit. 

The terminal 30g and terminal 30g_f relays are retained in the power distributor. 
The DC/DC control unit basically operates in the following modes: 

• Boost mode 

• Bypass mode 


35 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 































Bypass mode 

In bypass mode, the electrical system power supply is not fed through the DC/DC con¬ 
verter. A bypass passes it straight through to the outputs of the DC/DC converter. 

Boost mode 

In boost mode, the electrical system voltage is adjusted. The decision as to when stabi¬ 
lization is necessary/possible is dependent on the following factors: 

• Terminal 50 on/off 

• and input voltage at the DC/DC converter. 

Terminal 50 

Boost mode is activated if terminal 50 is on and the voltage drops below 10.5 V. As soon 
as terminal 50 is active, the DC/DC converter goes into a standby mode in order to 
improve response characteristics. Not until the voltage drops below the defined threshold 
of 10.5 V is boost mode activated and the matched voltage supplied to the terminal 30g 
and 30g_f relays.

Automatic Start/Stop II (MSA II) 


Originally the MSA system was only available for manual transmission European BMW 
models. (This system is described in the previous section of this training manual). MSA II 
however, is the second generation of the system that was especially adapted to operate 
with automatic transmissions and BN2020 vehicles. 

The F04 ActiveHybrid 7 was the first BMW in the US market (as of 3/2010) to use the 
MSA function in combination with an automatic transmission. That system uses the E 
Machine to start the combustion engine instead of a conventional type starter. 

The FI 0 528i (N20), 535i (N55) and FI 2 640i (N55) are available as of 9/2011 with the 
MSA II system (as standard equipment) with both the manual and automatic 8 speed 
transmission while the E89 sDrive28i (N20) is currently only available with MSA if com¬ 
bined with the manual transmission. 

MSA II system highlights: 

• Air conditioning function is enhanced with the cold storage evaporator 

• The hydraulic pressure accumulator allows MSA II to operate with automatic 
transmissions. 

• Driver presence detection via driver's seat belt and driver's door switch.

System Overview 


Automatic start/stop function - Manual transmission 

The operating logic of the automatic start/stop function in vehicles with manual gearbox 
has already been discussed in the MSA I section of this training material. 

When the car is stopped and the driver engages neutral and releases the clutch pedal, 
the automatic start/stop function switches the engine off. This means that the vehicle 
does not use any fuel when it is at a standstill. When the driver depresses the clutch 
pedal again, the engine is automatically restarted and the driver can continue driving. 

Automatic start/stop function - Automatic transmission 

The description that follows therefore deals specifically with the automatic start/stop func¬ 
tion in conjunction with the automatic transmission. 


The engine will NOT automatically turn OFF if: 

• Outside temperature below 37.4°F. 

• Outside temperature above 86°F. 

• Vehicle interior is not yet warmed up or cooled down. 

• Engine is not yet warmed up. 

• Vehicle battery state of charge very low. 

• After vehicle was driven in reverse. 

• Steering wheel operated after vehicle stopped. 

• Stop&Go-Traffic. 


If MSA is active (ENGINE OFF), the engine will be turned ON automatically if: 

• Interior temperature cannot be maintained (cooling and heating). 

• Windshield fogging. 

• Vehicle battery state of charge drops below a threshold. 

• Steering wheel input is detected. 

• Change gear lever position from D to N; D to M/S; P to D. 

• The accelerator and the brake pedal are pressed at the same time.

DC/DC converter 

The higher frequency of starting operations in vehicles with the automatic start/stop func¬ 
tion can lead to voltage dips in the vehicle electrical system. One or two DC/DC convert¬ 
ers are installed in order to protect specific voltage-sensitive components (depending on 
the vehicle equipment). 

The DC/DC converters supply a constant voltage to the 30B_DC/DC terminals, also dur¬ 
ing the starting operation. 

A DC/DC converter is installed if the speakers are activated by a radio or additional ampli¬ 
fier. Two DC/DC converters are installed if the speakers are activated by one of the head- 
units, due to the high power consumption of the headunit. This applies for vehicles with¬ 
out the HiFi speaker system (SA 676) or the HiFi system (SA 677) but with one of the fol¬ 
lowing items of optional equipment: 

• Radio Professional (SA 663) 

• Navigation system (optional extra 609) 

As a basic rule, only one DC/DC converter is installed in vehicles with the HiFi speaker 
system (SA 676) or HiFi system Professional (SA 677). 

Note: For a detailed explanation of how the DC/DC converter operates refer to 
the MSA I section of this training material.

Automatic Mode 

The automatic start/stop function is ready for operation following every engine start. 

The function is activated once the vehicle reaches a specific speed: 

• Vehicles with manual transmission: > 5 km/h/3 mph. 

• Vehicles with automatic transmission: > 9 km/h/5 mph. 

The driver presence detection via the seat belt buckle switch and also via the door con¬ 
tact has been introduced as a new feature of MSA II. 

When the driver leaves the vehicle, the automatic start/stop function is deactivated, in 
order to prevent the engine from starting automatically. 

The MSA function is always reactivated if: 

• the driver's seat belt is fastened and the vehicle is travelling at a speed of > 5 km/h 

• the driver's door is closed and the vehicle is travelling at a speed of > 5 km/h/3 
mph*. 

* > 9 km/h/5 mph - vehicles with automatic transmission 

The prerequisites for deactivation of the automatic start/stop function vary, depending on 
which switching mode the seatbelt buckle switch and door contact are in when the auto¬ 
matic start/stop function is activated: 


Status during activation of automatic 
start/stop function 

Prerequisites for deactivation of automatic 
start/stop function 

• The driver's seat belt is fastened. 

• The driver's door is closed. 

The driver unfastens the seat belt buckle and 
opens driver's door. 

• The driver's seat belt is not fastened. 

• The driver's door is closed. 

The driver opens the driver's door. 

• The driver's seat belt is fastened. 

• The driver's door is opened. 

The driver unfastens the seat belt buckle. 


The automatic start/stop function is reactivated if: 

• the seat belt buckle is fastened and/or the driver's door is closed and the engine has 
been started 

• the seat belt buckle is fastened and/or the driver's door is closed and the vehicle is 
travelling at a speed of > 5 km/h/3mph*. 

* > 9 km/h/5mph - vehicles with automatic transmission 


44 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 




Driving 

The purpose of the automatic start/stop function is to switch the engine off when the 
vehicle is at a standstill. As long as the vehicle is in motion the driver will not be aware of 
the automatic start/stop function.

Stopping 

From the driver's point of view, the stopping process with subsequent engine stop is as 
follows: 



Index 

Explanation 

1 

Vehicle slows to a standstill, e.g. at a red light 

2 

Selector lever remains in the "D" drive position, driver depresses the brake 
pedal to decelerate and hold the vehicle at a standstill 

3 

The engine is switched off after roughly 1 second, "0" engine speed will be 
displayed on the tachometer 


In the situation depicted above the driver holds the car at a standstill by depressing the 
brake pedal. 

Alternatively, the driver can select selector lever position "P" and release the brake pedal. 
The engine remains switched off. If then the drive position "D" is subsequently engaged, 
the engine starts without delay. 


46 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 














Driving off 

The driver indicates his intention to drive off by releasing the brake pedal. 

If the driver previously held the car at a standstill by depressing the brake pedal, the 
engine starts as soon as the driver releases the brake pedal. 



Index 

Explanation 

1 

Driver wishes to continue the journey (e.g. green light) 

2 

The selector lever remains in drive position "D", driver releases the brake pedal 

3 

Engine is started, revolution counter and fuel consumption display revert back 
to normal to reflect the driving situation 


If the driver moves the selector lever into position "P" after the engine was switched off 
automatically, the engine starts automatically if the selector lever is now moved to posi¬ 
tion "D". 


During this process, the automatic engine start is not activated automatically via a signal 
from the brake light switch, but by the DSC control unit that monitors the brake pressure. 


Establishing start-up readiness 

If the driver wants to start the engine but not yet drive off, he can establish start-up 
readiness by: 

• Pressing the brake pedal briefly, applying more force 

• Releasing the brake pedal slightly 

Both of these actions will prompt the engine to start automatically. 


47 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 





















Automatic hold 

If the driver has activated the "Automatic Hold" function, he/she can also release the 
brake pedal once the vehicle has come to a standstill. The automatic start/stop function 
also switches the engine off in this case. The car is held at a standstill by the DSC 
hydraulics. The engine only starts if the driver operates the accelerator pedal. 

Preventing automatic engine shutdown 

In order to be able to drive off guickly, e.g. at a crossing, the automatic engine shutdown 
can be actively prevented if within one second after the vehicle comes to a standstill the 
brake pedal is pressed briefly, applying more force than usual, then immediately held with 
the usual brake pedal force.

Switch-off Inhibitors 

Under certain conditions it is necessary to suppress the MSA function: 

• the vehicle is coasting (vehicles with manual transmission only) 

• the brake vacuum is too low (vehicles with manual transmission only) 

• the brake pedal is not pressed firmly enough which means the vehicle is detected as 
not being held sufficiently (vehicles with automatic transmission only) 

• the vehicle stops on uphill/downhill gradients > 12% 

• the steering angle is > 6° 

• the steering wheel movement is not yet complete (as otherwise insufficient support 
will be provided by the power steering as a consequence) 

• the vehicle was not driven at a speed of > 5 km/h/3 mph* following the previous 
engine shutdown 

• the engine is not running at idle speed (accelerator pedal is being pressed) 

• the vehicle is being driven in reverse 

• the Hill Descent Control (HDC) has been activated 

• the operating temperature of the engine is too low 

• the carbon canister is being purged 

• the fuel grade is insufficient 

• the gearbox adaptation is active (vehicles with automatic transmission only) 

• the hydraulic pressure accumulator is not charged yet (vehicles with automatic 
transmission only) 

• stop-and-go traffic 

• the state of charge is too low 

• the ambient temperature is below +3 °C/ 37.4 °F (ice warning) 

• the ambient temperature is above +30 °C/ 86 °F (with heating and air conditioning 
system switched on) 

• the condensation sensor of the IHKA detects fogging of the windshield 

• the heating and air conditioning system is switched on but the passenger compart¬ 
ment has not yet warmed up or cooled down to the required temperature 

• the brakes have been applied via ABS. 

• > 9 km/h/5 mph - vehicles with automatic transmission 


49 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 




Switch-on Prompts 

Conversely, it may be necessary to start the engine under the following conditions: 

• the vehicle is not sufficiently held by the released brake pedal (vehicles with 
automatic transmission only) 

• the steering wheel is moved 

• the engine is not running at idle speed (accelerator pedal is being pressed) 

• the transmission changes from "P" to "D"; the driver previously shifted from "D" to 
"P" when the engine was automatically switched off (vehicles with automatic trans¬ 
mission only) 

• the transmission changes from "D" to "N" or "R" (vehicles with automatic transmis¬ 
sion only) 

• the brake vacuum is too low (vehicles with manual transmission only) 

• the state of charge is too low 

• the ambient temperature is above +30 °C/86 °F (with heating and air conditioning 
system switched on) 

• the condensation sensor of the IHKA detects fogging of the windshield 

• the evaporator temperature is too low to ensure sufficient climate control. 


50 

Automatic Start/Stop (MSA) 



Deactivation 

If a deactivation condition exists, the automatic start/stop function is deactivated. 

The following scenarios arise, depending on when the deactivation condition for the 
automatic start/stop function occurred: 

• the engine continues running and is no longer stopped automatically 

• the engine was stopped automatically and starts once again automatically 

• the engine was stopped automatically and no longer starts automatically (the Check 
Control message "MSA off" appears - the start/stop button must be operated in 
order to the start the engine). 

The following deactivation conditions may occur: 

• the driver's absence has been detected 

• the engine did not start when starting 

• the engine compartment lid is unlocked 

• a fault related to the automatic start/stop function has been detected at the engine, 
transmission or components involved in the automatic start/stop function 

• the bus communication is faulty 

• the automatic start/stop function has been deactivated via the automatic start/stop 
function button 

• the automatic start/stop function was deactivated via the diagnosis system 

• the vehicle is in transport mode 

• the engine was stalled. 

The individual statuses can be read out using the diagnosis system. 

An easy-to-follow example of a deactivation with subsequent switch-on request: 

• the automatic start/stop function is deactivated via the automatic start/stop function 
button in the automatic engine shutdown phase 

• as a consequence, the engine starts automatically 

• after this, no further automatic engine shutdowns occur, the automatic start/stop 
function remains deactivated.

System Components 


Storage Evaporator 

To maintain the climate control of the passenger compartment when the engine is off, 
for vehicles with automatic start/stop function, a cold accumulator, known as the storage 
evaporator, is installed. 

Function of the conventional air-conditioning evaporator 

The warm airflow is drawn across the air-conditioning evaporator as the refrigerant 
evaporates. The evaporation process extracts heat and moisture from the air as it flows 
across it. 

The heat is transfered to the refrigerant and sent to the AC system condenser. There it is 
extracted out of the vehicle through the process of convection as fresh airflows across 
the core of the condenser. 

Function of the storage evaporator 

The “cold” storage evaporator uses a cold accumulator that is installed behind a conven¬ 
tional air-conditioning evaporator.

As with a conventional air-conditioning evaporator, the storage evaporator also evaporates 
the refrigerant. In addition, the refrigerant passages are surrounded with a storage medi¬ 
um. As the evaporation process draws heat out of the storage medium it freezes and 
becomes rigid, this is refered to as the “transition phase” from liguid to solid.

If the engine is off, e.g. at a red light, the air conditioning compressor is also off. 

The refrigerant is no longer able to evaporate, thus the storage medium is no longer 
being cooled. 

When the transition phase temperature is reached, the storage medium starts to melt and 
thus draws heat from the air flowing across it.

Hydraulic Pressure Accumulator 

When the automatic start/stop function is activated the engine may shut off once the 
vehicle is at a standstill, the engine restarts automatically as the driver releases the brake 
to drive off. 

In these engine stop phases the transmission oil pump is not driven, thus the fluid pres¬ 
sure supply ceases, the gearshift elements open, and there is no longer a transfer of 
power in the transmission. Maximum transmission oil pressure is required in order for the 
drive off process to take place dynamically without a noticeable delay when the automatic 
start/stop function is activated. However, the mechanically driven transmission oil pump 
cannot build up pressure quickly enough while the engine is starting. 

A hydraulic pressure accumulator is therefore used in the automatic transmission for this 
purpose (as with F04). With the volume of transmission fluid stored in the hydraulic pres¬ 
sure accumulator, the shift elements can be filled as soon as the engine is started, even 
before the transmission oil pump has built up the necessary pressure to drive off.

Installation location 

The hydraulic pressure accumulator is integrated in the automatic transmission. It is 
located in the transmission oil sump, in the direction of travel behind the mechatronics 
module. 

The hydraulic pressure accumulator can be replaced as a separate component.

Electromechanical latch mechanism 


The hydraulic pressure accumulator consists of a hydraulic cylinder. This cylinder contains 
a piston that moves against the force of a spring. The piston can be electromechanically 
locked in the tensioned end position. The electromechanical latch mechanism incorpo¬ 
rates locking balls, a tension spring, a release spring, and a solenoid. 

The solenoid is activated and deactivated by the EGS. A corresponding wiring harness 
to the hydraulic pressure accumulator is laid inside the transmission housing. 

The cylinder of the hydraulic pressure accumulator is connected to the transmission's 
hydraulic system directly (without any valves between them). The hydraulic pressure 
accumulator in fact contains an element which functions as a throttle and non-return 
valve. The throttle limits the volumetric flow of the fluid while the hydraulic pressure 
accumulator is being filled. In general, this filling operation corresponds to the charging 
operation of the accumulator which is why the expressions "charging" or "discharging" 
are used in this description.

The non-return valve ensures that the transmission fluid flows into the hydraulic pressure 
accumulator via the throttle during charging. The transmission fluid does not flow through 
the throttle during the discharging process, the non-return valve now opens instead to 
allow an unrestricted flow of transmission fluid back into the hydraulic system. The pur¬ 
pose of the non-return valve is therefore not to maintain the pressure in the charged 
state. In the charged state, the transmission fluid in the hydraulic pressure accumulator is 
depressurized and the energy is stored in the tensioned spring. 


Charging 

The hydraulic pressure accumulator is therefore always charged when the engine is run¬ 
ning and the transmission oil pump is working. During charging transmission fluid flows 
through the throttle into the hydraulic cylinder. In the process only a small volume is 
drawn from the hydraulic system so that the pressure level does not drop unintentionally. 
The transmission fluid pushes on the piston which acts against the spring force increas¬ 
ing the tension on the spring.

At the end of the charging process the piston travels past the latch mechanism (locking 
balls) until it reaches the end/stop. The transmission fluid pressure holds the piston 
against the spring force in the end position. 

The latch mechanism does not engage yet. The hydraulic pressure accumulator is fully 
charged in this end position. 

Locking 

When the engine is switched off (while the hydraulic pressure accumulator is charged) 
the transmission oil pressure drops causing the spring to be released slightly. This allows 
the piston to slide into the locked position where locking balls hold the piston mechani¬ 
cally in place. 

The now energized solenoid holds the inner slide in place so that the locking balls cannot 
enter the channels designated for releasing the lock. The electric power used for this is 
low (< 10 W) and is only reguired while the engine is off. Therefor the additional energy 
consumption of the hydraulic pressure accumulator viewed over an entire driving cycle is 
very low.

Discharging 

When the engine is started, as the driver wants to drive off, the gearshift elements in the 
automatic transmission for driving off must be engaged. The hydraulic pressure accumu¬ 
lator supplies the transmission fluid pressure required for this during the discharging 
process. 

As the solenoid is deactivated for discharging the inner slide (driven by a small spring) 
moves in the direction of the locking balls. This allows the balls to enter the channels 
designated for releasing the lock which in turn releases the piston. The spring (com¬ 
pressed during the charging process) exerts force on the piston which pressurizes the 
transmission fluid in the cylinder. 

Discharging of the hydraulic pressure accumulator

Explanation 

1 

The large spring pushes on the piston,which in turn, forces the 
transmission fluid out of the hydraulic cylinder 

2 

Transmission fluid can now flow through the throttle 
and the opened non-return valve 

3 

Transmission fluid flows from the hydraulic pressure accumulator back 
into the hydraulic system of the automatic transmission 


The piston moves (in the graphic to the left) and thereby pushes the transmission fluid 
back into the transmission hydraulic system. The transmission fluid exits the cylinder 
through the now opened non-return valve and throttle. 

The oil volume forced back into the hydraulic system of the transmission is sufficient to 
engage the gearshift elements needed for the driving off process. This system is 
designed to provide the initial fluid pressure needed for the transmission to go into “Gear” 
at the exact moment just before the engine is started. As soon as the engine is started, 
the transmission fluid pressure is then again generated by the transmission oil pump and 
the entire process is restarted.

Service Information 


Protection Against Automatic Engine Start 

Observe the safety precautions when carrying out repair work on vehicles with the auto¬ 
matic start/stop function. 

The engine is prevented from starting automatically when repair work is being carried 
out in the engine compartment. The automatic start/stop function is deactivated as soon 
as the engine compartment lid is opened. The diagnosis system can also be used to 
deactivate the automatic start/stop function temporarily. 

Note: When the compartment lid contact switch is pulled out it engages in the 
Service position. The automatic start/stop function is subsequently 
active although the hood is open 

The engine can be restarted via the start/stop button. 

The automatic start/stop function is reactivated if: 

• the engine compartment lid is closed and the engine is started 

• the engine compartment lid is closed and the vehicle is travelling at 
a speed of > 5 km/h/3 mph* 

* > 9 km/h/5 mph - vehicles with automatic transmission 


Automatic start/stop function checklist of possible 
customer complaints 

In the event of customer complaints, check these against the "Automatic start/stop func¬

Power Management and Battery Replacement 

The automatic start/stop function and power management are strongly intertwined. 
Battery type and charge state data may be lost following: 

• programming of the engine control 

• replacement of the intelligent battery sensor 

• disconnection of the battery 

• battery replacement 

This data is only available again once a standby current measurement has been carried 
out internally in the vehicle and once it has gone to sleep and has been locked. This mea¬ 
surement takes around 6 hours and the vehicle must not be woken up during the 
process. Providing the data has not been transferred, the automatic start/stop function will 
not be active. 

In order for the battery data to be registered by the vehicle following battery replacement, 
its internal standby current must be measured. 

If the battery is replaced, an AGM battery must be reinstalled to ensure the automatic 
start/stop function remains in proper working order.
