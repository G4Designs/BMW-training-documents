N62 Engine Update 




Introduction 


Since the initial introduction of the N62 in the 2002 E65, there have been several new 
modifications to the original design. The N62B44 was also subsequently installed in the 
5, 6 and X5 series vehicles beginning with 9/03 production. 

The X5 4.6is, which uses the M62TUB44, has been replaced by the X5 4.8is from 4/04. 
The new E53 4.8is variant uses the modified N62 with a displacement of 4.8 liters. The 
power output and torque figures were also increased as well. 

For the 2005 model year, the new N62B48TU has been added to the model line. The 5, 
6 and 7 series vehicles have been re-named to reflect these changes. Beginning with 
May of 2005, the 550i, 650i and 750i/Li will be available with the new engine variant.

N62 Engine Update 


















































N62B48 


The N62B48 engine is an increased displacement variant of the N62B44. The following 
components have been modified for use in the E53 X5 4.8is: 

• Intake Silencer 

• Cylinder Head 

• Engine Block 

• Crankshaft 

• Pistons and connecting rods 

• Lubrication System 

• Exhaust System 

• Engine wiring harness 

Intake Silencer 

On account of the higher intake capacity at high engine speeds the flow characteristics of 
the intake silencer have been optimized for the N62B48 and the silencer has been 
additionally eguipped with a second intake snorkel. This intake snorkel is active in the 
area of the righthand fog light. The second intake snorkel does not have a negative 
effect on the fording depth. The second intake snorkel draws in additional air only when 
the engine is running at high load and speed. The main volume of air is drawn in via the 
sound absorption cover (3).

Cylinder Head 

The cylinder heads of the N62B48 are variants of the N62B44. Due to the higher stress 
load, the cylinder heads on the N62B48 are made from a stronger aluminum-silicon alloy. 
The combustion chamber diameter in the cylinder head has been adapted to the larger 
cylinder bore of the N62B48. The flange pattern of the exhaust manifolds on the cylinder 
heads has been changed in line with the new exhaust manifolds. Due to the close prox¬ 
imity to the hood, a heat shield has been mounted over the new exhaust manifolds on the 
cylinder heads. 

Secondary Air System 

The N62B48 is no longer equipped with a secondary air system so that the secondary air 
duct in the cylinder head is also rendered unnecessary. This modification has been made 
possible by using an optimized catalytic converter coating. 

Cylinder Head Gasket 

The cylinder head gasket has been adapted to the larger combustion chamber diameter. 
For the N62B48 it is identified by two 6 mm holes on the left next to the BMW part 
number. 

Engine Block 

Compared to the N62B44, the diameter of the cylinder bores in the N62B48 have been 
increased by 1 mm to 93 mm. 

The crankshaft bearing caps feature apertures (1) for the purpose of improving ventilation 
lengthways in the crankcase and reducing pump and splashing losses in the crankcase.

N62 Engine Update 


Crankshaft 

For strength reasons, the crankshaft material in the N62B48 has been changed from 
lamellar graphite to steel. The journal width of the crankshaft has been adapted to the 
modified connecting rods and therefore reduced from 42 mm (N62B44) to 36 mm 
(N62B48). To increase the displacement, the stroke of the crankshaft journals has been 
increased from 82.7 mm to 88.3 mm. 

Pistons and Connecting Rods 

The pistons have been adapted to the increased cylinder bore diameter. The connecting 
rods of the N62B44 feature an asymmetric form. The connecting rods are symmetrically 
formed on the N62B48. The symmetrically formed connecting rods permit a more 
uniform force application. 

Conseguently, it has been possible to reduce the width of the connecting rods from 
21 mm (N62B44) to 18 mm (N62B48), matching the width of the crankshaft journals. In 
view of the higher mechanical loads in the big-end bearing, different bearing shells are 
used on the bearing cap and rod sides in the N62B48. Glyco 199 (sputter bearings) are 
used on the connecting rod end in the N62B48. These bearings are very important as 
the bearing shells on the connecting rod end are subject to high pressure loads. 

Glyco 81 (three-component bearings) are fitted on the bearing cap end to withstand the 
tensile loads that occur at this point. 

Lubrication System 

Shorter oil spray nozzles are used on the N62B48. They have been adapted to the 
longer stroke of the piston and must not be confused with the oil spray nozzles of the 
N62B44. 

The N62B48 is eguipped with a modified oil pan. The bottom section of the oil pan has 
been lowered by 16mm to accommodate the increased displacement of the N62B48. 
This modification minimizes power losses that occur in the crankcase as the result of 
pumping and splashing movements. By lowering the bottom section of the oil pan it was 
necessary to open up the thrust panel in this area. As a result, the bottom section of the 
oil pan on the N62B48 was no longer supported by the thrust panel and lies freely on the 
underbody. For this reason, the oil pan material has been changed from cast aluminum 
to sheet steel. The bottom section of the oil pan is made from 2 mm thick sheet steel 
and is less susceptible to mechanical influences compared to the B44 (cast aluminum). 

The dipstick has been lengthened in line with lowering the bottom section of the oil pan. 
Due to the lowered bottom section of the oil pan in the N62B48, an extended intake 
snorkel is installed on the oil pump. 

The N62B48 features an oil cooler with increased cooling capacity. It is located in front of 
the radiator under the A/C condenser in the cooling module. The function and design are 
identical to those of the oil coolers already used in the N62 for the Hot Climate variants.

Exhaust System 

The flow characteristics of the exhaust system have been optimized for the N62B48. 
The pipe diameter has been widened. 

Exhaust Manifold 

The exhaust manifolds have been newly developed for the N62B48 and are designed as 
4-2-1 exhaust manifolds. The newly developed form prevents residual gasses entering 
the combustion chamber, thus improving the cylinder charge and the torgue progression 
in the lower engine speed range.

Catalytic Converters 

The catalytic converters feature an optimized catalytic coating. This coating has a faster 
response characteristic and higher temperature resistance. The faster response charac¬ 
teristic of the catalytic converters renders the secondary air injection after starting the 
engine unnecessary on the N62B48. 

Engine Wiring Harness 

The engine wiring harness has been lengthened for the oil level sensor due to the 
lowered bottom section of the oil pan. As from the launch of the N62B48, the same 
wiring harness will also be installed in the N62B44.

N62 Engine Update 



N62TU 


The N62 engine is replaced by the N62TU engine as of April 2005. The N62TU engine 
features changes from its predecessor in the following areas: 

• Air intake duct 

• Differentiated intake system (DISA) 

• Crankshaft 

• Oil dipstick 

• Oil pump 

• Inlet and exhaust valves 

• Spark plugs 

• DME 9.2.2 

• Secondary Air System 


Air Intake Duct 


The N62B48TU engine has a greater displacement and thus a larger air reguirement. 
Due to the new lower profile hood design of the 7 series, a new air intake ducting is 
reguired. A larger, two-channel air intake duct is therefore used.

Differential Intake Air System (DISA) 

The previous fully variable intake system is no longer used in the N62TU engine. A new 
two-stage intake system (DISA) is used instead. The previous intake manifold was made 
from magnesium, the new intake is manufactured from glass fiber reinforced plastic. 

There are two servomotors which provides a 2-stage (long/short) function of the intake 
manifold runners. Due to the increased displacement and engine power, the fully variable 
intake system is no longer needed.

Long Intake Passage

Directional movement of sliding sleeves

Short Intake Passage 




In the intake system a sliding sleeve (3) is located at the intake manifold for each cylinder. 
The displacement of the sleeves determines whether the intake passage is long (1) or 
short (2). At idle a long intake passage is set (torque setting). 

From 4700 rpm, the sleeves are pushed back and a short intake passage is thereby set 
(power setting). When there is no flow, the sliding sleeves remain in their respective 
position. 

Varying the intake passages controls the pressure wave in the intake manifold in such a 
way as to produce a boost effect in the high rpm range. The sliding sleeves are driven by 
a servomotor assigned to each cylinder bank. The two servomotors together with the 
differential pressure sensor form a single component. 

The 12V servomotors are actuated by the ECM via a PWM signal. While the sliding 
sleeves are open (power setting), the servomotors are actuated with a 5 % PWM signal 
in order to hold the sleeves in their open position. 

The servomotors do not have position feedback. The sleeves can be inspected visually 
through the throttle valve opening. The sleeves are opened and closed once when the 
ignition is turned on. This prevents the sleeves from seizing during extended operation in 
the torque setting. 

The bores for the fuel injectors and the connections for crankcase and tank ventilation are 
located on the intake system as well.

The following illustrations show the sliding sleeves of the intake runner in their respective 
positions. The first illustration (1) shows the intake sleeves closed (long runner). This 
setting is for low RPM to create higher torgue. 

The second illustration (2) shows the intake sleeves open (short runner). This setting is 
for high RPM which takes advantage of the pressure wave effect for increased power.

N62 Engine Update 




Crankshaft 

Due to the increased demands, the N62B48TU engine has a steel crankshaft. In the 
interests of reducing power loss (oil churning losses in the crankcase), the crankpin width 
has been reduced from 42 mm to 36 mm. The connecting rods are adapted accordingly. 

Oil Pump 

The geometry of the oil pump is specifically adapted. Oil churning losses in the 
crankcase are further reduced by the modified design of the oil deflector. 

Oil Dipstick 

The E65 Facelift model series is eguipped with an electronic oil level display. The engine 
oil dipstick has a modified handle in black. This eliminates the need for the customer to 
check the engine oil level twice.

Inlet and Exhaust Valves 

The stem diameter has been reduced from 6 mm to 5 mm. The moving masses 
reduced in this way result in a higher RPM capability. 

Spark Plugs 

The previous surface-gap spark plugs with 2 ground electrodes have been replaced by 
spark plugs with the spark position brought forward and a hook electrode. 

This enables better ignition of the fuel/air mixture. In the new spark plugs the center 
electrode is made of platinum (replacement interval: every 100,000 miles).

Digital Motor Electronics (DME) 

The N62TU engine is equipped with DME ME9.2.2. The functions of the ME 9.2.2 are 
carried over from the previous ME 9.2 of the N62 engine. 

The pin assignment of the ME 9.2.2 has not changed in relation to the ME 9.2.1. An 
ME9.2.2 control unit and a VALVETRONIC control unit are used to run the N62TU. 

The following changes have been made: 

• New processor (clock frequency 56 MHz) 

• Lambda oxygen sensor LSU 4.9 

• Hot-film air-mass meter HFM 6 

• Software for electronic oil level measurement. 

Lambda Oxygen Sensor 

An LSU 4.9 oxygen sensor is used as the control sensor for each cylinder bank. 
Compared with the LSU 4.2 oxygen sensor previously used, the LSU 4.9 oxygen sensor 
reaches operational readiness twice as fast. 

Full operational readiness is reached after 10 seconds (LSU 4.2 = 20 seconds). This 
rapid starting capability is made possible by the use of a smaller ceramic element. The 
outer dimensions of the oxygen sensor remain unchanged. 

The previous opening for the supply of ambient air (reference air measurement) has been 
dispensed with. The new sensor differs from the LSU 4.2 in that a porous layer 
permeable by air is used instead of a reference air channel. The function stays the same. 
The ambient air is directed to the measuring element via the connecting cable. 

Hot-film Air-mass Meter (HFM) 

The HFM 6.4 is used in the N62TU engine. The sensor signal is already digitized in the 
HFM 6.4. The digitized signal is sent to the ECM (DME).
