N63TU2 Engine 

1. Introduction 


The N63TU2 engine replaces the predecessor N63TU. The key enhancements of the N63TU2 over 
the N63TU are the improved exhaust-gas characteristics, the availability of the engine torque over a 
wider speed range together with optimized consumption, and a more efficient production process in 
the plant for the new N63TU2 engine. 

The unique selling points of the new N63TU2 engine for the market include innovative detailed 
solutions such as the internal engine thermal management system during warm-up (called SCC, 
"Split Cooling Combined", the engine oil/coolant heat exchanger integrated into the engine V, 
the half-shell intake system and the engine charging using the twin-scroll exhaust turbocharger 
technology. 

The new N63TU2 engine will be introduced into series production for the first time with the new G12. 
In this documentation the differences to the N63TU predecessor engine are described.

N63TU2 Engine 

1. Introduction 

1.4. Engine identification 

1.4.1. Engine designation 

The N63TU2 engine in version N63B4402 is described in this documentation. The N63B40O2 
engine in a different capacity class is also available for the Chinese market; however, this engine is not 
considered in this documentation. The basic design of the N63B40O2 engine is identical to that of the 
N63B4402 engine. The reduced capacity is the result of a reduced piston stroke caused by a longer 
connecting rod and the reduced compression ratio. 

In the technical documentation, the engine designation is used to ensure unambiguous identification 
of the engine. 

The technical documentation also contains the short form of the engine designation N63TU2, which 
only indicates the engine type.

1.4.2. Engine identification 

The engines have an identification mark on the crankcase to ensure unambiguous identification and 
classification. This engine identification is necessary for approval by government authorities. The first 
six positions of the engine identification correspond to the engine designation. 

The engine number can be found on the engine above the engine identification. This consecutive 
number, in conjunction with the engine identification, permits unambiguous identification of each 
individual engine.

N63TU2 Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 

2.1. Engine housing 

The engine housing comprises of the engine block, cylinder heads, cylinder head covers, oil sump and 
the gaskets. 

2.1.1. Crankcase 

The crankcase on the N63TU2 engine has been completely redesigned and is manufactured from 
low-pressure die cast AlSil 7Cu4Mg, as on the N63TU engine. The cylinder barrels are made from 
Alusil. Like its predecessor in the N63TU engine, the closed-deck crankcase in the N63TU2 engine is 
characterized by a double main bearing screw connection with side wall connection. 

The crankcase cast part consists of the cylinder bores with Alusil coating, the bearing ways with the 
bore holes for the crankshaft and associated bearings and the water jackets of the cylinders. The 
water jackets of the crankcase and the water ducts in the cylinder head form the basis for the revised 
coolant passages inside the engine and the thermal management system of the N63TU2 engine. This 
design has also deleted the need for the coolant chamber sealing cap at the rear on the crankcase.

The V area of the N63TU2 has been adapted to the crankcase with regard to the attachment of the 
engine oil/coolant heat exchanger. The oil holes as well as the water ducts in the crankcase have been 
adapted to the connection required for the engine oil/coolant heat exchanger.

2.1.2. Cylinder head gasket 

As on the N63TU engine, a three-layer spring steel gasket is used for the cylinder head gasket. There 
is a stopper plate (2) in the area of the cylinder bores in order to achieve sufficient contact pressure for 
sealing.

In contrast to the N63TU engine, on the N63TU2 the contact surfaces with the cylinder head and 
engine block are no longer fully coated, but instead have partial screen printing coating. By omitting 
the coating in the coolant duct areas, the risk of the coating coming loose and contaminating the 
coolant circuit is minimized.

2.1.3. Cylinder head 

The cylinder head of the N63TU2 engine is a new feature with partially integrated intake system. 
Thanks to this partially integrated intake system in the cylinder head, the passages characteristics 
of the incoming air has been optimized and the space required to install the intake pipe has been 
significantly reduced. It has also allowed the weight of the cylinder head to be reduced by 1.5 kg / 3.3 
lbs.

With the exception of the combustion chamber dome and the valve gear (which have been taken 
over from the N63TU), the cylinder head is a completely new component in the N63TU2 engine. The 
coolant passages in the cylinder head are separate from the coolant passages around the cylinder 
bores. By taking over the VANOS solenoid valves into the cylinder head cover and the VANOS 
adjusters (as is already the case for the N20 engine and the modular engines), the bore holes for the 
VANOS solenoid valves in the cylinder head could be removed, meaning the associated engine oil 
ducts in the cylinder head can also be simplified. 

3rd-generation Valvetronic technology is also used in the N63TU2 engine, as is already the case in the 
N55 and N63TU engines. The Valvetronic servomotor is connected on the outer side at the cylinder 
head. 

A_ 

The combination of exhaust turbocharger, Valvetronic and direct fuel injection is known as Turbo 
Valvetronic Direct Injection (TVDI).

2.1.4. Cylinder head cover 

Design 

The design of the cylinder head cover in the N63TU2 engine is the same as for the N63TU engine, 
but with minor modifications to the crankcase ventilation and the mountings for the VANOS solenoid 
valves. As in the N63TU, a ventilation register with an additional ventilation line is used. Each bank has 
its own oil separator. An additional line from the crankcase ventilation to the air intake system is not 
used as corresponding bore holes for the individual intake ports are integrated in the cylinder head. 

The camshaft sensors are positioned on the front of the cylinder head cover. 

To separate the oil contained in the blow-by gas, a labyrinth oil separator is used. A pre-separator 
(7) and a fine deflection plate with small air vents (6) are in the passages direction. The oil drops are 
separated at these barriers and return to the cylinder head via the return line (9 and 10). An impact 
surface (5) with an upstream mesh that ensures further separation of oil particles. The oil return 
(10) is equipped with a non-return valve in order to prevent direct intake of blow-by gasses without 
separation. If the oil level increases in this pipe, the non-return valve opens and the oil drops into the 
cylinder head. Finally, depending on the operating condition of the engine, the cleaned blow-by gases 
are fed back into the intake system either via the non-return valve (1) or via the volume control valve 
(12 and 3).

Crankcase ventilation in naturally aspirated engine operation 

In the naturally aspirated engine operation there is a vacuum in the air intake system (12). The two 
volume control valves (3) are opened. The cleaned blow-by gases reach the inlet areas of both banks 
and thus the air intake system through the left oil separator via the intake pipe (5) and ducts in the 
cylinder head (19). As there is a risk that oil may be drawn in via the crankcase ventilation in the case of 
large vacuums, the volume control valve has a throttle function and limits the passages and thus also 
the pressure level in the crankcase. 

The vacuum in the crankcase ventilation keeps the non-return valves (2 and 6) closed. Fresh air 
flows from the two clean air pipes through the right oil separator into the inside of the engine via the 
overlying leakage holes. The vacuum in the crankcase ventilation is thus restricted. At the same time 
the chemical ageing of the lubricating oil and also the water content in the blow-by gases are reduced 
by flushing the crankcase with fresh air.

Crankcase ventilation in charged operation 

In charged operation the pressure in the intake system (12) increases and thus closes the volume 
control valves (3). As there is a vacuum in this operating condition in the clean air pipe (7), the non¬ 
return valves (2 and 6) for the clean air pipe thus open and the cleaned blow-by gases are conveyed via 
the compressor of the exhaust turbocharger and the charge air cooler (9) into the air intake system.

2.1.5. Oil sump 

The oil sump is made from die-cast aluminium. In the N63TU2 engine it has a two-part design and 
consists of an upper and a lower oil sump section. The oil filter is integrated in the upper oil sump 
section. 

2 different oil sumps are used depending on the drive concept. On rear-wheel drive vehicles a 
completely new design is used that offers the maximum possible oil volume thanks to its screwed and 
permanently sealed side boxes, which make the best possible use of the available space. For rear- 
wheel drive vehicles, the oil sump for the N63TU2 engine is identical for all planned vehicles with this 
drive concept. 

The oil sump for four-wheel drive vehicles is also a new design. In addition to the drive shaft tunnel 
for front-wheel drive, it also supports the front axle differential at the designated, cast flange surfaces. 
For vehicles with four-wheel drive, the oil sump in the N63TU2 engine is also identical for all planned 
vehicles with this drive concept.

The oil filter module is integrated into the upper oil sump section on the left-hand side of the engine. 
The oil pressure sensor and the characteristic map control valve for the characteristic map-controlled 
oil pump are screwed to the upper section of the oil filter module.

The upper oil sump section is screwed to the crankcase using a beaded metal gasket. The lower oil 
sump section is likewise screwed to the upper oil sump section. Like the upper oil sump section, the 
lower oil sump section is made from die-cast aluminium and supports the oil-level sensor and oil drain 
plug. 

The oil pump is screwed to the crankcase and is driven by the crankshaft via a chain. As on the N63TU 
engine, the oil deflector is integrated into the upper oil sump section and has been taken over from this 
model.

2.2.1. Crankshaft with bearings 


Crankshaft 

The entire crankshaft of the N63TU2 engine has been taken over from the N63TU engine. It has a 
stroke of 88.3 mm and is made from C38. It is a forged crankshaft with a hardened surface layer and 6 
balance weights. 

Crankshaft bearings 

The crankshaft of the N63TU2 engine is supported by five bearings. The entire crankshaft bearings of 
the N63TU2 engine have been taken over from the N63TU engine. The two-material thrust bearing is 
located in the middle at the third bearing position. Robust lead-free two-material bearings are used.

2.2.2. Flywheel 

In contrast to the N63TU engine, the flywheel on the N63TU2 has been redeveloped. Thanks to this 
new design, the number of separate components that make up the flywheel has been reduced from 4 
on the N63TU engine to 3 on the N63TU2 engine.

The new three-part flywheel is being integrated into the ongoing standard production of the N63TU 
engine as well as the N63TU2 engine. The three-part flywheel is backwards-compatible with the 
N63TU engine.

2.2.3. Connecting rod with bearing 

Connecting rod 

The connecting rod on the N63TU2 engine has been taken over from the N63TU engine. It is a 
cracking forged connecting rod with even pitch. The small connecting rod eye is drilled into the forged, 
trapezoidal connecting rod head, undergoes precise surface treatment, is hardened and therefore has 
no bushing. The force acting from the piston via the wrist pin is optimally distributed to the bushing 
surface. 



Bearings 

The connecting rod bearing shells have no lead and have been changed over from electroplated 
bearings in the N63TU engine to steel/aluminium/anti-friction coating in the N63TU2 engine. On the 
connecting rod bearing rod side, a G-411 bearing made of bronze and the red anti-friction coating 
"IROX" is installed. On the connecting rod bearing cap, an A-370 aluminium bearing is used. 


30 


N63TU2 Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 

IROX coating 

In order to comply with the increasingly stringent exhaust emission regulations, most combustion 
engines nowadays are equipped with an automatic engine start-stop function. This has led to a huge 
increase in starting cycles. 

To ensure the engine runs smoothly, it is important that sufficient lubricating oil is supplied to the 
bearing positions of the crankshaft. If the oil supply can be ensured, solid body contact will not 
occur between the connecting rod bearing journal and connecting rod bearing shell due to the thin 
lubricating film. 

If the engine is now stopped, it will not be possible for the mechanically driven oil pump to maintain the 
oil supply. The oil film between the bearing positions flows off. Solid body contact occurs between the 
connecting rod bearing journal and connecting rod bearing shell. Once the engine is restarted, it takes 
a certain amount of time for the lubricating film to fully re-establish itself. The connecting rod bearing 
shell may be subject to wear in this short period. The IROX coating reduces this wear to a minimum. 

The IROX-coated bearing shells are only located on the connecting rod side as here the load acts 
mainly on the bearing shells. The bearing shell caps are equipped with a bearing shell without IROX 
coating. 

The IROX bearings are red due to their special coating.

The IROX coating is applied to a conventional bearing shell. It consists of a binding resin matrix made 
of polyamide-imide with embedded hard particles and solid lubricants. The polyamide-imide ensures, 
in combination with the hard particles, that the bearing shell surface is so hard that material abrasion 
is no longer possible. The solid lubricants reduce surface friction and replace the oil film which briefly 
no longer exists between the bearing shell and the connecting rod bearing journal during the starting 
phase. 


2.2.4. Piston with piston rings 

On the N63TU2 engine, newly developed cast pistons with a Mahle piston ring package are used. The 
shape of the piston crown in the N63TU2 engine was modified in order to achieve a compression ratio 
of 10.5:1 in the N63TU2 as opposed to 10:1 in the N63TU. The piston crown was also adapted to the 
combustion process, the valve positions and the use of solenoid valve injectors with multiple nozzles in 
accordance with the N63TU2 engine.

In order to improve the drainage of oil in the N63TU2 engine, the piston was fitted with an additional 
oil groove underneath the oil scraper ring groove, as on the N55 engine. Together with the 8 oil drains 
in the piston skirt, the additional oil groove facilitates the drainage of the oil pushed down by the oil 
scraper ring when the piston moves down. This prevents the oil from being carried past the piston 
rings, in particular when the engine is in coasting overrun mode (during which a vacuum is generated 
in the combustion chamber). 

In terms of the piston rings, the ring package from Mahle has been taken over from the N63TU engine. 
Only the width of the oil scraper ring in the N63TU2 engine was reduced from 2 mm to 1.8 mm.

2.3. Camshaft drive/chain drive 

The entire chain drive for driving the camshafts on the N63TU2 engine has been taken over from the 
N63TU engine. As on the N63TU engine, a toothed sleeve-type chain with 142 elements is used per 
cylinder bank for driving the assembled camshafts. This is supplied with oil via the oil spray nozzle in 
the chain tensioner. Tensioning rail, guide and slide rails are now different parts for both banks. The 
tensioning rail with an integrated thrust piece is made completely from plastic.

2.4.1. Design 

In the N63TU2 engine, in addition to the double VANOS the fully variable Valvetronic is also used, 
as in the N63TU engine. In contrast to the N63TU engine (in which the VANOS solenoid valves were 
integrated into the cylinder head), on the N63TU2 engine the central VANOS solenoid valve is installed 
(already known from the N20 engine and the B Gasoline engines in a modular design). Thanks to these 
measures, the design of the cylinder head was simplified by removing the oil-carrying ducts running to 
the VANOS control. 

The rest of the valve gear essentially consists of the familiar components from the N63TU engine.

Camshafts 

The N63TU2 engine possesses the known camshafts in a lightweight construction. All cams are 
forced onto knurled points. The camshafts have a mounting for the central VANOS units and modified

Intake and exhaust valves 

The intake and exhaust valves both have a shaft diameter of 6 mm. In contrast to the N63TU engine, 
the valve stems on the N63TU2 engine are chrome-plated. The exhaust valves are hollow and filled 
with natrium (which is Sodium). This results in improved and quicker heat dissipation. 

Valve stem guides 

The N63TU2 engine has high-temperature-resistant valve stem guides made of brass. 

2.4.2. Valvetronic 

A_ 

The Valvetronic comprises fully variable valve lift control and variable camshaft control (double 
VANOS), which makes the closing time of the intake valve freely selectable. 

Valve lift control is performed on the intake side, while camshaft control is performed on both the 
intake and exhaust sides. 

Throttle-free load control is only possible if: 

The lift of the intake valve and the adjustment of the intake and exhaust camshafts are variably 
controllable. 

Result: 

The opening and closing times and the opening period and the lift of the intake valve is variable. 


VANOS 

The valve overlap times have a significant impact on the characteristics of a gasoline engine. An 
engine with a small valve overlap therefore tends to have a high maximum torque at low engine 
speeds, but the maximum power that can be achieved at high engine speeds is low. The maximum 
power achieved with a large valve overlap on the other hand is higher, but this is at the expense of the 
torque at low engine speeds. 


39 








N63TU2 Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 

The VANOS provides a solution. It makes a high torque possible in the low and medium engine speed 
range and a high maximum power in the higher engine speed ranges. A further benefit of the VANOS 
is internal EGR. This reduces the emission of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx), particularly in the partial 
load range. The following is also achieved: 

• Faster heating up of catalytic converter 

• Lower pollutant emissions during cold start 

• Reduction in consumption.

Reason for using the double VANOS 

The advantages of a Valvetronic are lower charge cycle losses and therefore potential for reducing fuel 
consumption by adopting an appropriate driving style. However, in contrast to throttle valve-controlled 
systems, Valvetronic cannot reduce charge-cycle losses in the full load range. 

VANOS unit 

With older VANOS systems, such as those used in the N63TU and N55 engines, the VANOS adjusters 
were controlled by separate VANOS solenoid valves integrated into oil ducts in the cylinder head. 

The oil ducts in the cylinder head are reduced and the adjustment speed is increased by using a 
VANOS solenoid valve unit and a mechanical VANOS central valve, which is located inside the VANOS 
unit.

On the intake side the basic VANOS position is "late", adjustment is for an "earlier" setting.

The locking pin ensures that the VANOS adjuster adopts a clear, locked position when depressurized. 
The locking spring ensures the unit is locked by continuously pushing the locking pin into the locked 
position when the actuator is de-energized. The VANOS unit is blocked in this condition. The timing 
can be adjusted in this way. This is important when the engine is started to ensure exact timing. The 
oil pressure which is present for timing advance simultaneously unlocks the locking pin via oil ducts in 
the VANOS unit. If the camshaft is to be “advanced”, the locking pin is then forced by the applied oil 
pressure against the locking spring towards the cartridge and the locking cover is released for VANOS 
adjustment.

VANOS central valve 


The VANOS unit is secured to the camshaft by the VANOS central valve. The oil passages rate into the 
VANOS adjuster is simultaneously controlled by this VANOS central valve. The system is actuated by 
a solenoid actuator, which presses its own piston against the piston (4) of the VANOS central valve, 
thereby pressing it against the spring (8). The oil passages rate is controlled via the piston (4) and the 
bore holes in the sleeve (5). 

The following graphic shows the oil passages rate in the VANOS central valve at the intake camshaft 
for controlling the camshaft adjustment to achieve a "late" setting when the solenoid actuator is de¬ 
energized. When the solenoid actuator is de-energized, the piston (4) is moved by the spring into 
the "extended" setting. This causes oil to passages from the main oil duct into the bore hole to the 
VANOS oil duct (late setting). 

The small graphic shows the oil passages from the VANOS adjuster into the cylinder head when the 
engine is stopped.

The following graphic shows the oil passages in the VANOS central valve at the intake camshaft 
for controlling the camshaft adjustment to achieve an "early" setting when the solenoid actuator is 
energized. When the solenoid actuator is energized, the piston (4) is moved against the spring into 
a "retracted" setting. This causes oil to passages from the main oil duct into the bore hole to the 
VANOS oil duct (early setting). The oil in the chambers for the VANOS late setting can passages into 
the cylinder head via the gap created between the piston (4) and the housing (6).

Valve lift control 

On the N63TU2 engine, the Valvetronic system has been taken over from the N63TU engine with the 
following modifications. 

• Sliding blocks with only one screw connection. 

• Smaller and more powerful Valvetronic servomotor, taken over from modular engines. 

As can be seen in the following diagram, the Valvetronic servomotor is attached at the intake side to 
the cylinder head. The eccentric shaft sensor is integrated in the Valvetronic servomotor. 

The Valvetronic III system is used - this supports masking and phasing and is already used on the 
N55 and N63TU engines. For more information on masking and phasing, please refer to the Technical 
Reference manual ST501 Engine Technology. 

The roller cam follower of the intake side and the intermediate lever are made from sheet metal and 
divided into various classes. This can be seen on the punched-on numbers.

2.5. Belt drive 

The design of the belt drive was taken over from the N63TU. The belt pulley of the crankshaft is new 
and made from high-strength plastic. The belt level was moved forwards by 20 mm. As there is no 
power steering pump, the air conditioning compressor is installed on the right of the engine. The 
belt drive consists of the alternator, coolant pump and air conditioning compressor. The belt drive is 
operated with a tensioning pulley with torsion spring tensioner.

On the N63TU2 engine, "SynTAK" covers are being used for the first time. They are located on the left

The SynTAK system provides acoustic insulation against engine noises for critical acoustic vibrations 
between 0.5-2 kHz. It also ensures that heat is retained in different operating conditions, such as when 
the automatic engine start-stop function (MSA) stops the engine or if the engine is switched off for a 
relatively long period. In some cases it is also responsible for the cable routing for the actuators and 
sensor system used in the N63TU2 engine.

3.2. Oil pump and pressure control 

The N63TU engine has a volume-passages-controlled pendulum slide cell pump. In the N63TU2, this 
is supplemented by the familiar characteristic map control from other BMW engines. 

The volume-passages-controlled pendulum slide pump (supplemented by the characteristic map 
control) is driven at the rear by the crankshaft via a sleeve-type chain. 

The actual oil pressure is recorded via an oil pressure sensor and forwarded to the Digital Motor 
Electronics (DME). The Digital Motor Electronics (DME) performs a target/actual comparison based 
on the stored characteristic maps. The map-controlled valve is activated by means of a pulse-width 
modulated signal until the nominal pressure stored in the characteristic map has been reached. During 
this process, the delivery rate of the oil pump varies according to the oil pressure in the oil duct to 
the map-controlled control chamber. However, the main function of the volume-passages-controlled 
pendulum slide cell pump is identical to the existing pendulum slide cell pump. 

Information on the operating principle of a volume-passages-controlled oil pump can be found in the 
Training Reference Manual ST1116 "N63 Engine".

3.2.2. Oil pump 

The oil pump plays a central role in modern combustion engines. Due to the high power and enormous 
torque which is present even at low engine speeds, it is necessary to ensure a reliable oil supply. This 
is necessary on account of the high component temperatures and heavily loaded bearings. 

To minimize fuel consumption, the delivery rate of the oil pump must be adapted to the demand. 

Compared against the simple volume passages control provided by the pendulum slide cell pump in 
the N63TU engine, on the N63TU2 engine this volume passages control has been supplemented with 
a characteristic map. 

In order to meet acoustic requirements, the oil pump is designed as an asymmetrical 6-chamber 
pendulum slide cell pump. This has been made possible as the chamber sizes are different. The 
chamber sizes vary from chamber to chamber and have different angles. As such, 3 chambers 
each with 53° and 3 chambers with 67° are used. The difference in chamber size causes irregular 
pulsations from the oil pressure (which are otherwise regular). This measure has improved the acoustic 
characteristics of the oil pump.

A rotor with pendulum rotates as shown in the graphic on the pump shaft. A crescent-shaped cavity 
arises through the eccentric position. During this process, the oil is drawn into the expanding chamber 
(intake side) and is delivered via the contracting chamber (pressure side). 

When the engine is in operation, oil pressure is admitted to the map-controlled surface and the 
second-level control surface of the oil pump. Depending on the oil pressure, the adjusting ring is 
pushed via the center of rotation at the bearing tube to varying degrees of force against the adjusting 
ring springs. The change in eccentric position of the adjusting ring changes the size of the chamber, 
and therefore also the intake and pressure power of the oil pump. 

To prevent overloading of the oil pump, a filter is installed upstream of the pump inlet. The maximum 
oil pressure of the oil circuit at the pump outlet is restricted by a pressure limiting valve. The opening 
pressure of the pressure limiting valve is 23 +/-1 bar. 

3.2.3. Map control valve 

On the N63TU2 engine, the characteristic map control valve is installed on the oil sump and is 
connected with the oil pump via bore holes in the oil sump and crankcase using "connector tubes". 
This design eliminates the need for interference-prone cable ducts into the oil sump. 

The map-controlled valve is a proportional valve which can control the oil pressure linearly.

The oil pressure sensor is connected to the main oil duct and delivers the actual oil pressure at 
the Digital Motor Electronics (DME). The DME calculates the required target oil pressure based on 
the engine's operating point and the temperature. A pulse-width modulated signal is sent to the 
map-controlled valve based on the determined set point deviation. Depending on the pulse-width 
modulated signal, the width of the valve spool opening in the map-controlled valve varies. Depending

on the available opening cross-section, more or less engine oil can passages from the oil duct of the oil 
filter into the oil duct and to the oil pump. This oil passages changes the position of the adjusting ring 
in the oil pump, and therefore the delivery rate of the pump. 

3.2.4. Normal operation 

The oil pump has 2 separate control loops in order to guarantee normal operation (characteristic map 
control operation) and emergency operation (second level control operation).

This control loop operates with an external map-controlled valve. The characteristic map control 
valve controls the oil pressure in the characteristic map control chamber using software in the DME. 
If the oil pressure in the characteristic map control chamber increases, the surface difference in the 
control chambers presses the adjusting ring further against the adjusting ring spring, and the pump 
eccentricity is reduced. This results in a lower volumetric passages.

During emergency operation, the system operates without the map control by the Digital Motor 
Electronics (DME). In this operating condition the characteristic map control valve is de-energized 
and releases the oil duct from the characteristic map control chamber to the oil sump. The purpose of 
emergency operation is to keep the oil pump at a constant, volume-passages-controlled oil pressure 
level. For this purpose, the oil pressure is guided directly from the main oil duct into the second level 
control chamber. This then corresponds to the principle of a volume-passages-controlled oil pump 
without characteristic map control, as on the N63TU predecessor engine.

3.3.1. Oil cooling 

In order to cool the engine oil, the N63TU2 engine has an engine oil/coolant heat exchanger that is 
connected directly to the crankcase and is a completely new component. As such it replaces the 
familiar external air/engine oil heat exchanger from the N63TU engine (which was installed on the right 
next to the cooling module). By integrating the engine oil/coolant heat exchanger into the V space of 
the N63TU2 engine, the thermostatic control and the associated components could be removed, as 
could the oil lines and the engine oil/air heat exchanger in the front of the vehicle.

The engine oil/coolant heat exchanger meets all engine oil cooling requirements up to the lowest 
engine speeds. It also influences the engine oil temperature when the engine is warming up, without 
risks or additional interventions in the cooling power.

3. Oil Supply 

The cooling of the engine oil is ensured by the engine radiator. As it is integrated into the engine 
coolant circuit, the most important functional criterion has been met. The cooling power can now 
be varied for the engine oil using the electrical radiator fan, regardless of the air stream and ambient 
temperature. This allows higher cooling power to be selected, which may be required in the case of 
low speeds or when the vehicle is at a standstill, for example. 

Further advantages of the engine oil/coolant heat exchanger connected to the crankcase are: 

• Closed oil circuit. Protection against contamination as external lines are screwed 
in the plant and during a service. 

• No sound transfer from the oil pump to the oil lines screwed to the vehicle. 

A 

If the engine oil/coolant heat exchanger is removed and refitted, care must be taken to ensure that no 
contamination enters. Coolant must not enter the bore holes for the engine oil, and engine oil must not 
enter the coolant bore holes. Coolant bore holes and engine-oil bore holes on the crankcase and on 
the engine oil/coolant heat exchanger must be sealed immediately using suitable plugs. 


3.3.2. Oil filtering 

Naturally the N63TU2 engine has a filter bypass valve which can open a bypass round the filter 
if, for example, the engine oil is cold and viscous. This occurs if the pressure difference between 
before and after the filter exceeds approx. 2.5 bar. This ensures that the filter is bypassed much less 
frequently and any dirt particles are reliably filtered out. The filter bypass valve is integrated in the oil 
filter housing. 


3.4. Oil monitoring 

3.4.1. Oil level 

In order to monitor the oil level, the N63TU2 uses the latest generation of oil-level sensors. The oil- 
level sensor is a PULS 3 oil-level sensor. The PULS 3 oil-level sensor is characterized by new control 
electronics with faster and more robust starting characteristics. The abbreviation "PULS" stands for 
"Packaged Ultrasonic Level Sensor" and, as the name implies, ultrasonic measuring technology is 
used as the basis. The oil-level sensor is screwed into the oil sump from below and, in addition to the 
oil level, also measures the oil temperature using an ultrasonic method. The measuring range of the 
oil-level sensor is 18 mm to 95.8 mm. If engine oil is temporarily over-filled, an air bubble in the cap 
area stops any engine oil from entering the oil-level sensor. An oil level dipstick is also installed on the 
N63TU2 engine. 

3.4.2. Oil pressure sensor 

In contrast to the N63TU (in which an oil pressure switch was installed), the N63TU2 uses an oil 
pressure sensor to monitor the oil pressure. 


65 




N63TU2 Engine 

3. Oil Supply 

3.4.3. Oil temperature sensor 

In addition to the oil temperature sensor in the oil-level sensor, an oil temperature sensor is installed 
behind the starter motor in the pressure oil duct after the engine oil/coolant heat exchanger. This 
engine oil temperature sensor is a new part for the N63TU2 engine. In contrast, on the N63TU engine 
the engine oil temperature was modelled using various parameters. The engine oil temperature sensor 
monitors the oil temperature once it exits the engine oil/coolant heat exchanger. The measured value is 
used to control the dynamic heat transfer to cool or heat the engine oil via the coolant. 


3.5. Oil spray nozzles 

In the N63TU2 engine, components which cannot be reached directly by an oil duct are lubricated and/ 
or cooled by oil spray nozzles. 

3.5.1. Piston crown cooling 

The oil spray nozzles for piston crown cooling, as used in the N63TU2 engine, are in principle familiar. 
They incorporate a non-return valve to enable them to open and close only from a specific oil pressure. 
The opening pressure and closing pressure have been adjusted compared with the N63TU engine. 
Each cylinder has its own oil spray nozzle, which obtains the correct installation position through its 
design. In addition to the piston crown cooling, these are also responsible for the lubrication of the 
wrist pins.

On the N63TU2 engine, the characteristic map control of the volume-passages-controlled oil pump 
is a key factor in ensuring compliance with ULEVII. Thanks to the volume-passages-controlled oil 
pump, supplemented by the characteristic map control, the oil pressure can be reduced to under 
3.3 bar in the warm-up phase. As a result of this reduction, there is insufficient oil pressure at the oil 
spray nozzles to open the nozzles. This measure also suppresses the intended function of the oil 
spray nozzles, namely to cool the piston crowns in the warm-up phase. The effect of this is that the 
piston crowns heat up faster and thus less fuel is condensed at the cold piston crowns in the warm¬ 
up phase, resulting in higher particle values as a result of unburned fuel. When a certain operating 
temperature is reached, the oil pressure is increased by the characteristic map control of the volume- 
passages-controlled oil pump, which raises the oil pressure to above the opening pressure for the oil 
spray nozzles and thus activates the piston crown cooling. 


3.5.2. Chain drive 

The chain drive in the N63TU2 engine is divided into an upper section, the camshaft drive, and a lower 
section, the oil pump drive. 

Camshaft drive 

The oil spray nozzles for the lubrication of the timing chains are integrated in the respective chain 
tensioner of the banks. They spray the oil directly onto the timing chain. A throttle in the oil spray 
nozzle limits the emerging oil. The timing chain of the camshaft drive is designed as a toothed sleeve- 
type chain.

The oil pump is driven via a sleeve-type chain by the crankshaft. The sleeve-type chain is kept

3.5.3. Camshaft 

The oil supply of the chain tensioner, the hydraulic valve clearance compensating elements and the 
bearing positions in the cylinder head is effected via a rising pipe from the engine housing in the 
cylinder head. A non-return valve in the cylinder head in the rising pipe prevents the oil duct idling. 

3.5.4. Valvetronic servomotor 

The worm gear for adjusting the eccentric shaft is lubricated using the oil spray from the camshaft.

N63TU2 Engine 

4. Cooling 

The cooling system also has similarities with the N63TU engine. The engine and charge air cooling 
both have separate cooling circuits. The cooling of both control units of the Digital Motor Electronics 
(DME) has been integrated into the coolant circuit of the charge air cooling. The coolant circuit for 
the engine and exhaust turbochargers is also called the high-temperature coolant circuit. The coolant 
circuit for the charge air cooling and DME control units is known as the low-temperature coolant 
circuit. 

A brand-new feature is the thermal management system inside the engine, known as SCC "Split 
Cooling Combined", which includes the engine cooling (high-temperature circuit). 

Under the designation "SCC", the cooling concept inside the engine is described below. The main aim 
of this is to allow the engine to warm up faster. Thanks to the faster warm-up (supported by the SCC 
concept), significant reductions in consumption and emissions were again achieved in the N63TU2 by 
reducing friction during warm-up.

4.1.1. Cooling circuit, engine 

The engine cooling system is an independent coolant circuit known as the "high-temperature 
circuit". It comprises the conventional engine cooling and cooling of the turbochargers. Even the 
vehicle interior heating is supplied by the coolant circuit of the engine cooling system. 

The engine cooling is ensured using a conventional mechanical coolant pump. Overall different 
versions of the cooling system can be installed depending on the equipment and national-market 
version of the vehicle. There is also the variant for hot countries. In this case, an external radiator is 
connected on the left and right in the direction of travel, parallel to the coolant circuit. The additional 
radiator is equipped with a non-return valve with compression spring to prevent a return by the electric 
auxiliary water pump in the case of a low volumetric passages of the coolant. 

The electric fan has a nominal power of 850 W. 

The following graphics show the installation locations and layout of the components.

Split Cooling (SC) 

In order to ensure optimal heat distribution between the cylinder head and crankcase during the 
warm-up phase, it would be ideal to be able to supply these two components individually with the 
required coolant. The ideal solution could be if it were possible during warm-up to completely block 
the coolant supply for the crankcase and to supply the entire volume of coolant to the cylinder head. 
Both components would therefore always be in an ideal temperature range for low fuel consumption, 
ideal emission behavior and, in particular, for the engine's carbon dioxide emissions. One possible 
solution in this context would be to disconnect the coolant circuit of the crankcase from the coolant 
circuit of the cylinder head using a shutoff valve. However, if the engine's temperature characteristics 
mean that the crankcase has to be cooled, then the coolant circuit of the crankcase could be included 
by opening the shutoff valve. This would then be what is known as a pure Split Cooling concept. 

Split Cooling Combined (SCC) 

It was not possible to use the Split Cooling concept for the N63TU2 engine, as there is insufficient 
space for the additional installation of shutoff valves for the two coolant circuits for the crankcase and 
cylinder head. The N63TU2 engine therefore uses a modified version of the Split Cooling concept 
known as the Split Cooling Combined (SCC) concept. Instead of shutoff valves (which would allow the 
coolant circuits for the crankcase and cylinder head to be separated), on the SCC concept the coolant 
circuits for the cylinder head and crankcase are combined in a parallel configuration. Here, during the 
cooling-down period and when the thermostat is open, 80% of the coolant flows through the cylinder 
head with the cylinder bridge cooling integrated into the crankcase, and 20% of the coolant flows 
through the crankcase. During the warm-up phase (during which the characteristic map-dependent 
coolant pump is only operated at 10% volumetric passages), 8% of the coolant is supplied to the 
cylinder head and 2% of the coolant is supplied to the crankcase. 


As such, the SCC concept allows the warm-up phase for the N63TU2 to be significantly shortened, 
thereby optimizing fuel consumption and emission behavior and, in particular, the CO 2 emissions of 
the N63TU2 engine.

On an engine block that is not equipped with the SCO concept, 100% of the coolant flows through the 
crankcase and cylinder head by means of longitudinal distribution.

Explanation

Longitudinal distribution on N63TU engine 

B 

Parallel configuration on N63TU2 engine 


On the SCO concept, 20 % of the available coolant flows along the crankcase during the cooling-down 
period and when the thermostat is open. All cylinders always benefit from the same coolant passages 
and the cooler coolant is always conveyed to the rear cylinders (which are subjected to high thermal 
stresses). The coolant for cooling the cylinder head is conveyed along the crankcase via the outer 
gallery. During the cooling-down period and when the thermostat is open, 80 % of the coolant is used 
for cooling the cylinder heads via the defined apertures in the cylinder head gasket. The coolant then 
flows through the cylinder head from the intake side to the outlet side, is collected on the outlet side 
in a collecting duct together with the coolant for cooling the crankcase, and conveyed to the coolant 
pump again. 

The V-shaped, drilled bridge cooling in the crankcase is supplied from the cylinder head through 
separate bore holes. The outflow runs through short coolant ducts into the coolant gallery in the 
cylinder jacket on the outlet side. 

In order to ensure that sufficient coolant is available at all cylinders in the cylinder head in line with the 
temperature characteristics (hot rear cylinder-higher coolant quantity), the passages rates and cooling 
section lengths are adapted to specific cylinders thanks to the geometric design of the coolant ducts 
in the crankcase. The geometry of the coolant ducts has been selected such that all paths for the 
coolant to each individual cylinder have the same length, but the cross-sections of the coolant ducts 
are adapted in line with the coolant quantity required by each cylinder. 

Thanks to this design for the coolant ducts on the N63TU2 engine, the system resistance in the 
cooling system as compared against the N63TU engine was reduced by 40% to 0.83 bar (N63TU = 
1.34 bar).

Characteristic map-dependent coolant pump 

The N63TU2 engine uses a characteristic map-dependent coolant pump, the main function of which 
corresponds to the familiar temperature-dependent coolant pump from the N63TU engine. The 
new feature on the characteristic map-dependent coolant pump is that a heating element has been 
integrated into the thermal actuator. The characteristic map-dependent coolant pump is therefore an 
active element of the "Split Cooling Combined" (SCC) concept. 

A thermal actuator (5) with an adjusting piston (4) made from plastic is integrated into the coolant 
pump. The adjusting piston is positioned over an inner second preloaded spring (3) and is supported 
at the lower end over the thermal actuator. The adjusting piston can thus be moved upwards over 
the thermal actuator, but axial movement is also allowed. The thermal actuator is secured over a long 
preloaded spring (2) with the cover (1) in the coolant housing. 

The thermal actuator (5) can also be influenced by the Digital Motor Electronics (DME) via the heating 
element (6) depending on the characteristic map. 

The adjusting piston (4) reaches over a lug into the groove of the ring valve (6), which can move 
outwards on the fixed ring insert (7) via guiding grooves. It is thus possible to fade the impeller (8) by 
the ring valve (6).

The graphic below shows the different positions of the ring valve. Upon a cold start of the engine the

carbon dioxide emissions. If the coolant operating temperature of 98°C / 208°F is exceeded, the 
thermal actuator switches and moves the adjusting piston. At the same time the ring valve is moved 
open. The impeller is now fully exposed, with 100% of the volumetric passages is available. 

This process can now also be influenced by the DME (which activates the electrical heating element) 
depending on the characteristic map.

Explanation

Basic operating principle: 

The opening point of the thermal actuator on the N63TU2 engine was increased by 18°C compared 
with the N63TU engine. Whereas on the N63TU engine the thermal actuator released a delivery rate 
of 100% at 80°C / < 176°F, on the N63TU2 engine this was increased to 98°C / < 208°F. As such, the 
engine temperature in warm-up phase I was increased to 98°C / < 208°F. During warm-up phase II until 
the thermostat opens, the engine temperature can reach 105°C / < 221 °F. 

By increasing the opening point of the thermal actuator to 98°C / < 208°F and thus providing a coolant 
pump delivery rate of 100%, the heat retention in the N63TU2 engine block was safeguarded. 

As such, the following aims were achieved with the N63TU2 engine: 


Further reduction in consumption. 

Further reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. 

Faster, longer and more efficient provision of heating. 


79 










N63TU2 Engine 

4. Cooling 

• Warm-up phase 1:10% delivery rate at an engine coolant temperature of -40°C to +98°C. 
Coolant delivered to the engine block, engine oil/coolant heat exchanger, exhaust turbocharger 
and vehicle interior as required. 

• Warm-up phase II: 100% delivery rate at an engine coolant temperature of +98°C to +105°C. 
Coolant delivered to the engine block, engine oil/coolant heat exchanger, exhaust turbocharger 
and vehicle interior as required. 

• Cooling-down period: 100% delivery rate at an engine coolant temperature as from 
+105°C. Coolant delivered to the engine block, engine oil/coolant heat exchanger, exhaust 
turbocharger, engine radiator and vehicle interior as required. 

In addition to the temperature-dependent switch point of the thermal actuator there is a speed- 
dependent safety function. This serves to protect the engine from overheating if a very high engine 
performance is demanded during a cold-start phase. From an engine speed of 3,500 rpm, the impeller 
is released completely via another adjusting mechanism so that a delivery rate of 100% is immediately 
available. This is realized via return of the coolant pressure from the pressure auger directly to the ring 
valve. The adjusting piston is axially disconnected from the thermal actuator as described above and 
acts against a second preloaded spring. In the vane chamber a speed-dependent coolant pressure 
builds up which presses the ring valve against the spring force of the adjusting piston in an open 
direction. The passages rate increase is effected without delay. 

In summary, a delivery rate by the coolant pump arises: 

• 10% at an engine coolant temperature < 98°C / < 208°F and an engine speed < 3500 rpm 

• 100% at an engine coolant temperature < 98°C / < 208°F and an engine speed > 3500 rpm 

• 100% at an engine coolant temperature > 98°C. / < 208°F 

Due to the characteristic map control of the switching coolant pump via the DME, it is also possible 
to increase the volumetric passages to a delivery rate of 100% if required, even with a coolant 
temperature of less than 98°C / < 208°F and an engine speed of less than 3,500 rpm. 

This has been made possible by the inclusion of an N63TU2-specific characteristic map for the 
switching coolant pump in the DME. The heating of the thermocouple is energized depending on 
the characteristic map. The characteristic map for the N63TU2 engine is determined based on the 
following parameters: 

• Load 

• Engine speed 

• Vehicle speed 

• Intake air temperature 

• Coolant temperature 


Components of cooling circuit of exhaust turbocharger 

In contrast to the N63TU engine, on the N63TU2 engine a number of modifications were made to the 
design of the coolant circuit for the exhaust turbocharger. 

• The installation location of the electrical auxiliary coolant pump has been changed. 

• The connection of the return from the exhaust turbochargers has been relocated.

Supply of the cooled coolant to the engine housing 


On the N63TU engine, the return of the exhaust turbocharger cooling was integrated into the supply to 
the radiator via the suction auxiliary coolant pump. This configuration meant that a significant portion 
of the heat required for a faster warm-up was lost via the radiator. 

On the N63TU2 engine, the electrical auxiliary coolant pump is integrated into the supply of the 
exhaust turbocharger coolant circuit in the form of a pressure pump. The connection of the return from 
the exhaust turbochargers was relocated to the thermostat housing in front of the thermostat main 
disc. 

This arrangement of components allows the waste heat of the exhaust turbochargers to also be used 
to heat up the N63TU2 engine more quickly during the warm-up phase via the mechanical coolant 
pump and stopped electrical auxiliary coolant pump. 

This arrangement also provides other benefits: 

• More even, faster heating of the exhaust turbochargers. 

• Dynamic heat transfer between the exhaust turbocharger, coolant and engine oil, thereby 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 

• Reduced thermal stresses for the exhaust turbocharger and electrical auxiliary coolant pump. 

• Easier filling and bleeding of the cooling system, in particular for the raised exhaust 
turbochargers over the mechanical coolant pump. 

As the mechanical coolant pump is driven by a belt, it cannot be used to cool the exhaust 
turbochargers after the engine has shut down. For this reason there is an electric auxiliary coolant 
pump, which works at a power of 15 W, for this cooling circuit. Whilst the engine is operating, the 
electric auxiliary coolant pump is activated as from 93° C taking into account the coolant temperature 
at the engine outlet. 


82 









N63TU2 Engine 

4. Cooling 

The after-run of the electric auxiliary coolant pump can last up to 30 minutes for a stationary engine 
and when the ignition is turned off. This is calculated on account of the following values: 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected fuel quantity 

• Intake air temperature 

• Exhaust-gas temperature 

• Fuel temperature 

The after-run of the electric fan can last up to 11 minutes. 

Another function of the electrical auxiliary coolant pump is to support the mechanical coolant pump. 
During the warm-up phase, the electric coolant pump supports the circulation of coolant in the cooling 
system. This additional circulation supports the heat transfer between the exhaust turbocharger, 
coolant and oil and thus reduces the warm-up phase. Further support is provided by the electrical 
auxiliary coolant pump in what is known as the hot-idling mode phase. In idle mode, the coolant 
passages of the mechanical coolant pump may not be sufficient to adequately cool the engine via the 
radiator during the cooling-down period when the engine is at operating temperature. In this operating 
range, the electrical auxiliary coolant pump supports the coolant passages through the radiator in 
addition to the mechanical coolant pump. 

A 

The cooling system (high-temperature coolant circuit) can be filled using the familiar vacuum filler 
device. Alternatively, the system can be filled using the standard procedure of adding the coolant via 
the expansion tank using the filler jug. However, in the process it must be ensured that the exhaust 
turbochargers are ventilated by pressing the accelerator to over 3,500 rpm in a controlled manner. For 
details of other approved ventilation methods, please see the repair instructions in the ISTA workshop 
information system. 


4.1.2. Cooling circuit of charge air cooler and DME 

For charge air cooling, the system again makes use of so-called "indirect" charge air cooling, which is 
cooled by a separate coolant circuit, the so-called "low-temperature circuit". 

An electric coolant pump is used for the coolant circuit of the charge air coolers and DME control units 
with an independent cooling system. The coolant circuit for the charge air cooling and Digital Motor 
Electronics (DME) contains a cross-passages radiator and 2 indirect charge air coolers.

The 80 W pump has a self-diagnosis function and dry-run protection. If the engine speed is increased

the DME. The expansion tank does not have a coolant level switch and does not automatically detect 
when the fluid level is too low.

Charge air cooler 

The charge air coolers have been reduced in size (dimensions), but still deliver the same performance 
data as for the N63B4401 engine to the greatest possible extent. 

• Charge air cooler temperature input: approx. 110 °C / 230 °F 

• Charge air cooler temperature output: approx. < 50°C / < 122 °F 

• Charging pressure: approx. 2,5 bar 

• Pressure loss through charge air cooler: approx. 11 mbar 

This has been made possible with optimized charge air and coolant conduction in the charge air 
cooler, which has a positive impact on the loss of pressure and the charge air cooling in the charge air 
cooler. The system supplier of the new charge air coolers is Delphi.

4.2. Heat management 

The N63TU2 engine comes with extensive heat management functions, controlled or supported by 
characteristic maps in the Digital Motor Electronics (DME). This comprises independent control of the 
electric cooling components of electric fan, map thermostat and coolant pumps. 


4.2.1. Auxiliary water pump 

The N63TU2 engine also has a total of 3 other electrical auxiliary coolant pumps in addition to the 
mechanical coolant pump: 

• for heating the interior 

• for cooling the exhaust turbochargers 

• for cooling the charge air coolers and the two control units of the Digital Motor Electronics. 

The electric coolant pump for the cooling circuit of the charge air with DME has a power of 80 W. 
The two others work at a power of 15 W.

If the coolant pump is removed and then to be reused, it is important to ensure that it is set down still 
filled with coolant. Drying out may cause the bearing positions to stick. The upshot of this is that the 
coolant pump may possibly not start, which in turn may result in engine damage. 

Before installing, turn the impeller manually to ensure that it moves freely. 


4.2.2. Data-map thermostat 

The N63TU2 engine is equipped with a characteristic map thermostat with travel sensor and return 
passages barrier. 

The function of the characteristic map thermostat is the same as on the N63TU. When not electrically 
controlled, the technical data of the thermostat is as follows: 

• Opening start at 105 °C/ 221° F 

• Complete opening at 120 °C. / 248°F 

In addition, an electric heater in the map thermostats can be used to make the thermostat open 
already at a lower coolant temperature.

Travel sensor 

In order to meet more stringent requirements from emissions legislation and to increase the reliability 
of the cooling system, the characteristic map thermostat was fitted with an opening detection function. 
As a result, it is now possible to monitor the opening function and thus detect a malfunction in the 
thermostat (OBD emission monitoring), including via diagnosis. 

A hall effect sensor monitors the opening status. The neodymium magnet required for the hall effect 
sensor is attached to the thermocouple rod. When opening the thermostat, the opening status of the 
main disc relative to the closing point can be accurately measured on the basis of the strength of the 
magnetic field and the resulting voltage. 

The electronic components are fully insulated from the coolant and are cast in an epoxy resin material. 

The travel sensor in the characteristic map thermostat allows the following OBD-relevant functional 
problems to be recorded: 

• Thermostat jams open. Can even be recorded before the engine starts (no emissions). 
(Relevant to OBD emission monitoring) 

• Thermostat does not open. Can be detected much sooner and the risk of overheating can 
be prevented. 

Previous experience with the indirect thermostat diagnosis, which is based on the medium 
temperature (coolant) and is used in the N63TU engine, has shown it to be inaccurate. As a result, it 
no longer meets current requirements as stipulated by the emission monitoring (OBD). Additionally, 
thanks to the monitoring and the diagnostic capability of the characteristic map thermostat, 
unnecessary replacement of thermostats is avoided. 

A_ 

As the travel sensor is a linear hall effect sensor, a resistance measurement for checking the sensor 
is not permitted. 


Return passages barrier 

The return passages barrier takes the form of an additional valve head on the thermostat. When the 
engine (and thus also the mechanical coolant pump) are switched off, this valve head closes the 
short-circuit cross section between the engine outlet and thermostat mixing chamber. However, the 
thermostat mixing chamber simultaneously acts as the suction chamber for the electrical auxiliary 
coolant pump for the exhaust turbochargers.

The return passages barrier influences the following 2 coolant circuits. 

Heating in vehicle interior 

If the return passages barrier were not fitted, when the engine is at operating temperature or stopped 
the electric coolant pump would always pump the same coolant to supply the heat exchanger for the 
heating system. This is because the coolant would always take the path of least resistance. The path 
of the coolant would then always rotate as follows: 

• Coolant pump feed line 

• Electric coolant pump for heating 

• Feed line to heat exchanger for the heating system 

• Heat exchanger 

• Return line of the heat exchanger for the heating system 
to coolant pump feed line 

As a result, the coolant cooled down by the heat exchanger for the heating system is always supplied 
to the heat exchanger for the heating system again. This would quickly lead to a noticeable reduction 
in heater output in the interior.

This is prevented by the return passages barrier as it closes this path of least resistance. As a result, 
the electric coolant pump always draws the coolant (at operating temperature) required for heating 
from the crankcase and cylinder head. The coolant-which is at operating temperature and available 
in a larger quantity in the cylinder head and crankcase - therefore ensures that the heating can be 
maintained for longer. This measure means, for example, that the engine can be stopped for longer by 
the automatic engine start-stop function (MSA) without a start request being sent from the integrated 
automatic heating/air conditioning system (IHKA) to the automatic engine start-stop function (MSA). 

In turn, this possibility to stop the engine for longer by the automatic engine start-stop function (MSA) 
allows fuel to be saved and carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced.

During after-run, the return passages barrier prevents the coolant from being constantly pumped 
to the exhaust turbochargers in a small coolant circuit (bypass), which would result in a difference 
in temperature between the exhaust turbochargers and the other engine components. The return 
passages barrier closes the bypass such that the coolant for cooling the exhaust turbochargers is 
always pumped via the radiator. This ensures that the larger quantity of available coolant (at operating 
temperature) is used in the radiator circuit to provide more even cooling between the exhaust 
turbochargers and the rest of the engine components. As a result, the temperature of the exhaust 
turbochargers can be maintained for longer and is aligned to the other engine components. This rules 
out negative temperature differences between the individual components. 

The return passages barrier does not function during the warm-up phase (when the main disc of the 
thermostat is closed) or in the cooling-down period (when the thermostat is open). During the warm¬ 
up phase (when the bypass is active), the spring force of the return passages barrier is overridden 
meaning the return passages barrier opens. As is already known, the coolant can then circulate in the 
small coolant circuit via the open return passages barrier.

The N63TU2 engine uses a new coolant temperature sensor compared with the N63TU. 

In comparison with the coolant temperature sensor from the N63TU engine, the new coolant 
temperature sensor has a faster response time as less material is used and the connector system 
is sturdier. The new installation position allows for even more precise temperature sensing in the 
N63TU2 engine.

The list below itemizes the most important changes to the intake and exhaust emission systems: 

• passages-optimized air intake duct with partial integration of the intake pipe into the cylinder 
head (half-shell intake system). 

• Hot film air mass meter 8. 

• 4 identical intake air pressure sensors, whereby in the intake pipe only the temperature value 
is measured, but in the charge air cooler the pressure and temperature values are measured. 

• Monitoring sensor changed over to LSF Xfour. 

• Exhaust manifold adapted for twin-scroll exhaust turbocharger. 

• Use of twin-scroll exhaust turbocharger technology with electrical wastegate valve actuators. 

• Use of electrical exhaust flaps in the rear silencer.

5.2.1. Hot film air mass meter 

The N63TU2 engine is fitted with the hot film air mass meter 8 supplied by Bosch. The hot film air 
mass meter 8 is already used on modular engines. A direct connection to the DME 8 is established via 
the SENT interface. The integrated SENT interface reduces the number of access lines on the hot film 
air mass meter and the DME. Furthermore, the SENT interface allows more data to be transferred even 
faster and more precisely than with a frequency interface (as was used for the hot film air mass meter 
7). This is also advantageous for compliance with future exhaust emission standards. 

Differences between hot film air mass meter 7 and hot film air mass meter 8 

In addition to the new data transfer interface SENT, the main difference between the hot film air mass 
meter 8 and the predecessor hot film air mass meter 7 is an additional integrated NTC temperature 
sensor. By integrating the temperature sensor, the sensor element was reduced meaning the 
aerodynamics of the hot film air mass meter housing could be optimized. The hot film air mass 
meter 8 also features lower power consumption < 20 mA (hot film air mass meter 7: < 100 mA), its 
voltage supply has been reduced to 5 V (hot film air mass meter 7:12 V) and the sensor element has 
integrated chip heating. The integrated chip heating is used to prevent deposits resulting from dirt 
particles or oil mist, for example. These can accumulate in particular when the engine is stopped 
(i.e. no air column movement on the sensor element) and cause inaccurate measurements or even 
damage. As such, in order to prevent these deposits the hot film air mass meter 8 is switched to chip 
heating mode in certain situations, such as when the engine is stopped by the automatic engine start- 
stop function. 

SENT protocol 

Single Edge Nibble Transmission 

Single Edge Nibble Transmission is a simple digital interface standardized in the automotive industry 
and used for communication between sensors and control units. 

It is a unidirectional, asynchronous voltage interface that requires only three lines: the usual 5 V supply 
voltage, the signal voltage and the ground connection. The SENT protocol is characterized by its 
simplicity and resistance to fault signals. Another advantage is that the data is available in digital 
format in the sensor after the A/D conversion, meaning it can be processed further directly by the 
control unit.

A _ 

Malfunction or disconnection of the hot film air mass meter does not immediately result in emergency 
engine operation. However, impaired mixture preparation and therefore poorer emission values are 
possible, which is why the emissions warning lamp lights up. 


5.2.2. Intake silencer 

The N63TU engine has its own intake silencer for each bank. These are fixed in the vehicle and hold 
the hot film air mass meters. 


5.2.3. Intake manifold 

The N63TU2 engine uses the newly developed half-shell intake system, which offers a number of 
advantages. These were realized by partially integrating the components that would otherwise be 
located in the engine into the cylinder head. Therefore, in the area of the cylinder head the intake 
system now only consists of an outer shell, which is sealed against the cylinder head using an all¬ 
round gasket.

5. Intake Air and Emission System 


Thanks to this new design for the intake system, the intake ports could be enlarged despite a 
shortening of the intake system. Likewise, the steps between the intake pipe and cylinder head as a 
result of tolerances were avoided. As such, pressure losses in the intake system were reduced by 6- 
7% compared with the N63TU engine. A significant amount of installation space was also created 
by shortening the intake system on the N63TU2 engine, which was made possible by the half-shell 
design. This newly created space can now be used for other purposes, or alternatively there is the 
option of using the N63TU2 engine for other vehicle projects. 


5.3. Exhaust turbocharger 

The N63TU2 engine has 2 exhaust turbochargers supplied by Honeywell. The exhaust turbochargers 
are twin-scroll exhaust turbochargers and, with the exception of the compressor and wastegate 
valve actuation, were taken over from the S63TU engine. The compressor and impellers were newly 
designed for the N63TU2 engine and thus adapted to its performance structure. Both exhaust 
turbochargers are a common part for both banks. As on the N63TU engine, a blow-off valve was 
dispensed with for this overall concept.

One-piece wastegate valves are used, increasing robustness. 

A 

For assembly precise alignment of the exhaust turbocharger is necessary. Please strictly observe the 
repair instructions. 


5.3.1. Charging pressure control 

An electrical wastegate valve actuator controls the charging pressure control on the N63TU2 engine. 

Electrified adjustment 

In contrast to a vacuum-controlled charging pressure control, the following components are not 
required: 

• Vacuum unit 

• Vacuum lines 

• Electro-pneumatic pressure converter 

• Vacuum reservoir 

Advantages of electrical activation 

• Faster control speed 

• More precise control 

• Simpler diagnosis 

• Fewer components 

• Larger opening angle of wastegate valve

Electrical connection 


A direct current motor and a sensor are located in the electrical wastegate valve actuator, resulting in 
a total of 5 electrical connections on the component. The wastegate valve is opened or closed by a 
lifting movement of the linkage. 

The electrical wastegate valve actuator can be replaced separately during a service. Each time the 
adjusting linkage is activated, the system must be re-adjusted with the assistance of the BMW 
diagnosis system ISTA. This measure is not required when replacing the entire exhaust turbocharger 
as the linkage is supplied preset. 

A_ 

If the electrical wastegate valve actuator is replaced individually, a teach-in routine must be performed 
using the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. 


The sensor is used to determine the position of the wastegate valve. The wastegate valve can move 
to any required position between maximum open and maximum closed. When the sensor signal or 
actuator drops out, the wastegate valve adopts the open position to allow charging pressure to build 
up. This ensures the journey continues with reduced engine performance. 

A 

As the position sensor is a linear Hall sensor, a resistance measurement for testing the sensor is not 
permitted. 


5.3.2. Function 

The blow-off valves at the exhaust turbocharger are discontinued for this overall concept as their job 
is effectively replaced by the engine interventions. The feasibility was supported by the use of an 
optimized compressor which permits a more stable pump design in comparison to the predecessor 
compressor. 

Reasons for the installation of a blow-off valve to date were: 

• Avoidance of pump for load shedding (transition from traction to coasting/overrun mode). 

• Possible pumping causes pulsating, acoustic interference noise. 

• Arising pressure waves as a result which burden the thrust bearing of the exhaust 
turbocharger. 


104 










N63TU2 Engine 

5. Intake Air and Emission System 

In the case of load shedding without a blow-off valve the aim is to avoid a compressor pump. A 
pumping compressor arises if high pressure ratios and low mass flows occur. In contrast the engine 
measures are that through the engine control the target mass passages is increased until the pump 
limit can fall below the limit and the charging pressure can dissipate. The necessary mass passages is 
adjusted by activating the throttle valve and valve lift. Excessive cylinder filling and the resulting high 
torque is then torque-controlled for example reduced via an ignition timing adjustment in retarded 
direction.

5.4.1. Exhaust manifold 

The exhaust manifold of the N63TU2 engine is manufactured from cast steel using foam casting.

To ensure that the exhaust flows combine, which is required for a twin-scroll exhaust turbocharger to 
work, the furthest apart igniting exhaust flows were combined on the cylinder bank side. As a result, 
the N63TU2 engine has a bank-specific exhaust manifold for cylinder banks 1 and 2. On the exhaust 
manifold for bank 1 exhaust flows 1-3 and 2-4 were combined; for cylinder bank 2 the exhaust flows 
of cylinders 5-6 and 7-8 were combined. 

5.4.2. Catalytic converter 

The N63TU2 engine has one catalytic converter per bank. The outlet hoppers are now single-walled. 
The catalytic converter near the engine comprises a 1st and a 2nd monolith. The catalytic converters 
have decoupling elements which are also described as expansion elements.

*ln the China version, a modified 3-way catalytic converter is used due to the high manganese content 
of the fuel (2-monolith system, cell density 400/400). 

Oxygen sensor before catalytic converter 

The oxygen sensor (LSU ADV) from Bosch is used as a control sensor before the catalytic converter. 
The function is comparable to the oxygen sensor (LSU 4.9) and therefore is not described in detail 
here. This oxygen sensor is already used in the N63TU engine. The abbreviation LSU stands for 
universal oxygen sensor and ADV for Advanced. 

The oxygen sensor before catalytic converter (LSU ADV) is characterized by the following advantages: 

• High signal running, especially in charged operation due to lower 
dynamic pressure dependence. 

• Increased durability thanks to reduced pump voltage. 

• Improved precision (vis-a-vis LSU 4.9 by 1.7). 

• Faster operating readiness < 5 s. 

• Increased temperature compatibility. 

• Improved system connector with better contact properties. 

The LSU ADV has an extended measuring range. It is thus possible to measure precisely from oxygen 
sensor 0.65. The new oxygen sensor is operational earlier, meaning exact measured values are 
available after only 5 s. 

The measuring dynamics of the sensor is higher, whereby it is possible to determine the air/fuel ratio in 
each cylinder separately and thus also control it. As a result, a homogeneous exhaust passages can be 
adjusted, the emission levels lowered and the long-term emission behavior optimized.

5. intake Air and Emission System 

Oxygen sensor after catalytic converter 

The oxygen sensor after catalytic converter is also called a monitoring sensor. The monitoring sensor 
LSF XFOUR from Bosch is used which is the successor sensor to the LSF 4.2. 

The LSF Xfour needs the DME 8.8 for signal evaluation and is characterized by the following 
properties: 

• In order to achieve faster response characteristics after the engine has started 
(halved compared with the LSF 4.2), a heater with a greater degree of regulation 
has been integrated into the LSF Xfour. 

• This improves signal stability. 

• Less space is required for installation. 

• Thanks to the high temperature resistance and optimal thermo-shock protection, 
the resistance to condensation in the exhaust tract following a cold start 

has been improved. 

The control sensor is located ahead of the 1st ceramic monolith, as close as possible to the 
turbine outlet. Its position has been chosen so that all the cylinders can be recorded separately. 

The monitoring sensor is positioned between the 1st and 2nd ceramic monoliths. 

5.4.3. Exhaust system 

Main differences in the exhaust system of the N63TU2 compared with the N63TU 

• Pneumatic exhaust flaps replaced by electrical exhaust flaps. 

The exhaust system on the N63TU2 engine for the 12 consists of: 

• 1 shell front silencer with a volume of 5 liters. 

• 1 shell center silencer with a volume of 5 liters. 

• 1 shell rear silencer with a volume of 38 liters. 

• 2 twin tailpipes with tailpipe trim attached to the body.

5.4.4. Electrically controlled exhaust flaps 

Electrically controlled exhaust flap(s) 

The exhaust flap is integrated into the rear silencer. The exhaust flap is operated by an axially arranged 
electric motor with integrated gears and electronics. The electrical controller for the adjustable 
exhaust flap has the following electrical connections: 

• Voltage supply (+) 

• Ground (-) 

• Actuating wire (signal line) 

At low engine speeds and low loads, the noise level can be significantly reduced by closing the 
exhaust flap. At high engine speeds and high loads, the exhaust gas counterpressure can be reduced 
by opening the exhaust flap. 


110 










N63TU2 Engine 

5. Intake Air and Emission System 


The exhaust flap is activated (using pulse width modulation) by the Digital Motor Electronics (DME). 
The input variables are: 

• Engine speed 

• Load 

• Driving speed 

The exhaust flap cannot adopt an intermediate setting; it is either fully opened or closed. The flap 
moves towards the respective mechanical end stop using pulse-width modulated signals (PWM 
signals). If faults are detected or the actuation stops, or after the engine has been stopped, the 
preferred position is the closed position. On vehicles with the M Sport exhaust system, the exhaust 
flap is open in Sport mode.

6. Vacuum System 

The vacuum system of the N63TU2 engine has been modified compared with the N63TU engine. 
The use of the electrical wastegate valve actuator means that the vacuum reservoir and pressure 
converter are no longer required. 

The vacuum pump on the N63TU2 engine supplies the brake servo with the required vacuum.

N63TU2 Engine 
7. Fuel Preparation 

For the N63TU2 engine the high-pressure injection is used. It differs from high-precision injection 
(HPI) in that it uses solenoid valve injectors with multihole nozzles. 


7.1. Overview 

The following overview shows the fuel preparation of the N63TU2 engine. It essentially corresponds to 
the systems with direct fuel injection familiar in BMW models. Only the routing of the fuel delivery line 
to the high pressure pumps has been modified and adapted.

By re-positioning the inlet bore holes at the high pressure pumps, they were moved away from the hot 
cylinder bank side to the cooler area. 


Bosch high-pressure fuel injection valves with the designation HDEV5.2 with CVO are used. The high 
pressure pump is already known from the previous 4 and 8-cylinder engines. 


113 


















N63TU2 Engine 
7. Fuel Preparation 

A_ 

Work on the fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. The coolant temperature 
must not exceed 40 °C. This stipulation must be observed without fail, as otherwise there is a risk of 
fuel being sprayed back on account of the residual pressure in the high-pressure fuel system. 

When working on the high-pressure fuel system, it is essential to adhere to conditions of absolute 
cleanliness and to observe the work sequences described in the repair instructions. Even the slightest 
contamination and damage to the screwed fittings of the high-pressure lines can cause leaks. 

When working on the fuel system of the N63TU2 engine, it is important to ensure that the ignition coils 
are not fouled with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by sustained contact 
with fuel. This may result in flashovers on the spark plug head and thus in misfires. 

• Before making any modifications to the fuel system, it is essential to remove the ignition 
coils and protect the spark plug shaft against the ingress of fuel by covering with a cloth. 

• Before reinstalling the solenoid valve injectors, remove the ignition coils and ensure 
that conditions of greatest possible cleanliness are maintained. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced. 


7.2. Fuel pump control 

The electric fuel pump delivers the fuel from the fuel tank via the feed line to the high pressure pump 
at a primary pressure of 5.9 bar. The on-load speed control is effected via the DME. The low-pressure 
sensor is dispensed with. 


7.3. High pressure pump 

The known Bosch high pressure pump is used. This is a single-piston pump which is driven from the 
exhaust camshaft via a triple cam. So that sufficient fuel pressure is guaranteed in each load condition 
of the engine, a high pressure pump is used in the N63TU2 engine for each bank. 

For further information on the high pressure pump, please refer to ST 1209 "N63 Engine" Technical 
Training manual.

7. Fuel Preparation 

7.4. Injectors 

The Bosch solenoid valve injector HDEV5.2 with CVO support is an inward-opening multi-hole valve - 
unlike the outward-opening piezo injector used in HPI engines. The HDEV5.2 too is characterized by 
a high degree of variability with regard to spray angle and spray shape, and is designed for a system 
pressure of up to 200 bar. 

These injectors are already used in the N55 and N63TU engines and in modular engines. 



N63TU2 engine, injector 


A 

The stems of the solenoid valve injectors can only withstand a certain tensile force and a certain 
torque. When removing and installing the injectors it is essential to follow the specific procedure 
set out in the repair instructions, as otherwise the injectors may be damaged. 

Due to the design, dirt particles, grains of sand etc. may enter the shafts of the injectors and 
spark plugs during operation, in particular in dusty environments with poor road surfaces. Before 
disassembly, always blow out the shafts with a sharp jet of compressed air from all possible positions 
and angles using a lance that is as long as possible. Once the injector or spark plug has been removed, 
any particles should also be cleared from the edge of the bore hole.

modular engines. Its appearance is characterized by a uniform housing and a uniform connector strip. 
However, the hardware inside has been adapted to the various applications. 

The control unit code (DME 8.x.yH) can be broken down as follows.

Examples for Gasoline engines: 

DME 8.4.OH = B48 PHEV* * (vehicle electrical system 1) 

• DME 8.6.1 = B58 (vehicle electrical system 2) 

• DME 8.8.0 = N63TU2 (vehicle electrical system 1) 

• DME 8.C.0 = N74TU (vehicle electrical system 1) 

*PHEV = Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle. 

As such, the N63TU2 engine has Bosch Digital Motor Electronics with the designation DME 8.8.0. 
There is a separate water-cooled engine control unit fixed to the engine for every bank. The actuators 
and sensors of cylinder bank 1 are assigned to the DME 1 control unit; accordingly, the DME 2 control 
unit is responsible for the functions of cylinder bank 2. DME 1 is the main control unit and receives all 
information concerning the entire engine, such as regarding the crankshaft sensor, and provides it to 
the DME 2 control unit directly or via the bus system. Due to the variety of sensors and actuators it 
was deemed necessary to use 2 control units.

Do not attempt any trial replacement of control units. 

Because of the electronic immobilizer, a trial replacement of control units from other vehicles must not 
be attempted under any circumstances. An immobilizer adjustment cannot be reversed. 


The cooling of the two control units of the Digital Motor Electronics is effected in the N63TU2 engine 
by connection to the cooling circuit of the charge air cooling. In this system, an aluminium cooling loop 
is integrated into the housing of the control units. 

The connector concept is identical to that on the modular engines and features a Nano MQS 
connector system (Micro Quadlok System). There is a logical division into 6 modules.

Measurements on the wiring harness may only be taken using measuring procedures approved by 
BMW. The use of incorrect tools such as gauge tips will damage the plug-in contacts.

9.2.1. Overall function 

The Digital Motor Electronics (DME) is the computing and switching center of the engine control 
system. Sensors on the engine and the vehicle deliver the input signals. The signals for activating 
the actuators are calculated from the input signals, the nominal values calculated using a computing 
model in the DME control unit and the stored program maps. The DME control unit activates the 
actuators directly or via relays. 

The DME control unit is woken up by the Body Domain Controller (BDM) via the wake-up line (terminal 
15 Wake up). 

The after-run starts after terminal 15 OFF. The adaptation values are stored during the after-run. The 
DME control unit uses a bus signal to signal its readiness to “go to sleep”. When all the participating 
control units have signalled their readiness to "go to sleep", the bus master outputs a bus signal and 
the control units terminate communication 5 seconds later.

The printed circuit board in the DME control unit accommodates 2 sensors: a temperature sensor 
and an ambient pressure sensor. The temperature sensor is used to monitor the temperature of the 
components in the DME control unit. The ambient pressure is required for calculating the mixture 
composition. 


9.3. Alternator 

The N63TU2 engine uses an alternator with a power of 252 A. A new feature is that the alternator does 
not rectify the supplied AC voltage using diodes as usual. As on the modular engines, rectification 
is carried out by an actively controlled metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor. The use 
of the actively controlled metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor to rectify the AC voltage 
has increased efficiency compared with the power diodes that are otherwise used. Thanks to this 
increased efficiency, the rectification process has been made more efficient within the installation 
space, which in turn lowers carbon dioxide emissions.
