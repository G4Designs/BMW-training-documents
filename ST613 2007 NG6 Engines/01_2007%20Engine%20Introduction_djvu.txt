New 6-Cylinder Engines for 2007 


Previously in 2005, BMW introduced the beginning of a new generation of six cylinder 
engines with the N52. Now, forthe 2007 model year, BMW has 3 new variations of the 
NG6 engine family. 



The first of the new engines is the N54, which will debut in the new 3-series coupe in 
September2006. The N54 is turbocharged and uses the second generation of direct 
injection (Dl 2). This engine will powerthe new 335i coupe in the fall of 2006. 

The N52 will eventually be replaced by the new N52KP. The N52 KP engine is an 
improved and cost optimized version of the N52. The N52 KP will be available in the 
328i and xi coupe from September and will replace the N52 in various models. 

Finally, the N51 which is a SULEV II compatible engine, will be phased into selected 
production models from 9/06. The N51 features many of the same features of the 
previous SULEV engine (M56) including a "Zero Evap" system.

New Engine Designations 


A new engine numbering system has been 
introduced to to enable fast and distinct 
identification. 

The "TU" designation has been dropped 
together with the associated version 
numberwhich is now replaced by a simple 
count number at the end of the engine 
designation. 

The codes T through K are also new forthe 
various power stages instead of the previ¬ 
ous "OL" or "UL” designations. 



For example, the new N52KP engine which is a variant of the original N52 engine will 
now be known as the N52B30O1. This would be instead of the traditional "TU" suffix 
as in - N52B30TU. 

The block stamping (above) is located in the same place as the previous N52 engine. 
The chart on the opposing page shows the breakdown of the new engine designations.

N54 Overview 

The first new member of the NG6 family is the N54 which will be initially available in the 
new 335i coupe (E92). The N54 continues the tradition of "efficient dynamics" by meet¬ 
ing the customer demand for high performance and the necessary requirements of low 
fuel consumption and emissions. 

The N54 is available as a 3.0 liter engine and features the following: 

• Exhaust driven turbocharger (Bi-turbo) 

• Airto air Intercooler 

• 2nd Generation Direct Injection (HPI) with piezo injectors 

• New engine management (MSD80) 

• Bi-VAN OS 

• All aluminum crankcase with iron cylinder liners (similar dimensions to N52) 

• External oil cooler 

• New high output electric water pump (400 W) 

• Aluminum cylinder head with plastic valve cover 

• Steel crankshaft

2007 Engine Introduction 



As perthe new engine designations, the N54 will be officially referred to as the 
N54B3000. The "0" designates the "upper" output range and the "O' indicates the first 
generation in this series. 

The N 54 features the new HPI injection system which is capable of pressures of to 200 
bar. This system features the new "piezo" injectortechnology with "outward" opening 
injectors. 

Also, the N54 benefits from parallel bi-turbocharging with airto air intercoolers. 



Overall, the N54 provides the driver with uncompromising response and high torque 
output in a package that is up to 150 pounds lighterthan a V-8 engine. The new 
technology used in the N54, allows for maximum efficiency and the required low tailpipe 
emission figures to meet ULEV II guidelines.

N52KP Overview 


The enhanced and improved version of the original N52 is referred to as the N52KP or 
more accurately the N52B30O1. This engine includes cost saving measures as well as 
various technical improvements. The N52KP will eventually replace the N52 in all vehicle 
applications. One of the first vehicles to use the N52KP will be the 328i coupe (E92) in 
September. 

The technical highlights of the N52KP include: 

• New engine management (MSV80) 

• New HFM (digital) 

• New throttle - EGAS8 with magnetoresistive position feedback 

• Plastic valve cover with integrated crankcase vent valve and oil separation 

• Stronger connecting rods 

• Exhaust valve stem increased to 6mm 

• New electric water pump (2nd generation) 

• Lightweight camshafts (hydroformed) 



10 

2007 Engine Introduction 




The N52KP will be available in three versions as follows: 

• N52B30O1 - High Output version with 260hp 

• N52B30M1 - M edium Output version with 230hp 

• N52B30U1 - Possible future application with 215hp 

Each of the above engines will have a different specific output for installation into various 
models. Forexample, the new E83 LCI (X3 3.Osi) will receive the "0" version which has a 
power output of 260 horsepower at 6600 RPM.

N51 Overview 


In orderto comply with SULEV requirements, the N51 is another variant of the N52 
engine. There are various measures to meet the E PA/C ARB standards, some of which 
are familiarfrom the previous SULEV (M 56) engine. 

Some of the SULEV measures forthe N51 include: 

• Near engine catalyst with additional underbody catalyst 

• Secondary air system 

• Optimized combustion chamber geometry in cylinder head 

• M odified piston crown for lower compression 

• Plastic valve cover with integrated crankcase vent valve and separator (from N52KP) 

• Stainless steel fuel lines with threaded connections 

• Radiatorwith "Prem-air" coating 

• Throttle system - EGAS08 carried overfrom N52KP 

• Airboxwith Activated carbon filter for EVAP control 

• Purge system pipes are made from "optimized" plastic
