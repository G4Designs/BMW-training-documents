NG6 Engine Management 


To accompany the new NG6 engines, 2 new versions of engine management systems 
are introduced for 2007. Both systems are variations of the MSV70 engine manage¬ 
ment which is familiar from the N52 engine for 2006. 

The two systems are as follows: 

• MSV80 Engine Management for N52KP and N51 (SULEV II) engines 

• MSD80 Engine Management for the N54 engine 

Both systems use enhanced processing and are adapted to each of the specific engine 
applications. Both of the control modules are identical and adapted from MSV70. 



The information contained within this training module is only intended to review the 
updates to the engine management systems as it applies to the N54, N52KP and N51 
engines. For more detail on the NG 6 engines beginning with the N52, refer to the 
training module “ST501 - New Engine Technology”.

Air Management 


With regard to the N54 engine, the air intake ducting plays a significant role due to the 
requirements for a turbocharged engine. In principle, the energy of the escaping exhaust 
gases is utilized to “precompress” the inducted fresh air and thus introduce a greater air 
mass into the combustion chamber. This is only possible if the air intake ducting is leak- 
free and installed properly.

It is important to note, when carrying out work on the air-intake ducting, it is very impor¬ 
tant to ensure that the components are installed in the correct positions and that all pipes 
are connected up with tight seals. 

A leaking system may result in erroneous boost pressure. This would be detected by the 
engine management system and ultimately result in in “limp-home” operation. This 
would be accompanied by a noticeable loss of engine power. 

For some of the connections, there are special tools designed to connect and disconnect 
some of the ducting to ensure proper “leak-free” connections.

Air Ducting Overview 

The fresh air is drawn in via the air cleaner (10) and the charge-air suction lines (6 + 18) 
by the compressors of turbochargers (23 + 24) and compressed. 

Because the turbochargers can get very hot during operation, they are connected with 
the engine's coolant and engine-oil circuits. The charge air is greatly heated when com¬ 
pressed in the turbocharger, making it necessary for the air to be cooled again in an 
intercooler (16). 

The compressed and cooled charge air is routed from the intercooler via the throttle valve 
(12) into the intake manifold. The system is eguipped with several sensors and actuators 
in order to ensure that the load of fresh air is optimally adapted to the engine's respective 
operating conditions. How these complex interrelationships are controlled is discussed in 
the following.

Exhaust Gas Turbocharging 

The turbocharger is driven by the engine's exhaust gases, i.e. exhaust gases under 
pressure are routed by the turbocharger turbine and in this way delivers the motive force 
to the compressor, which rotates on the same shaft. 

It is here that the induction air is precompressed in such a way that a higher air mass is 
admitted into the engine's combustion chamber. In this way, it is possible to inject and 
combust a greater guantity of fuel, which increases the engine's power output and 
torgue. 

The turbine and the compressor can rotate at speeds of up to 200,000 rpm. 

The exhaust inlet temperature can reach a maximum of 1050°C. Because of these high 
temperatures, the N54 engine's turbochargers are not only connected with the engine-oil 
system but also integrated in the engine-coolant circuit. 

It is possible in conjunction with the N54 engine's electric coolant pump even after the 
engine has been switched off to dissipate the residual heat from the turbochargers and 
thus prevent the lube oil in the bearing housing from overheating.

Bi-turbocharging 

Utmost importance is attached to turbocharger response in the N54 engine. A delayed 
response to the driver's command, i.e. the accelerator-pedal position, is not acceptable. 
The driver therefore must not experience any so-called "turbo lag". 

This reguirement is met in the N54 engine with two small turbochargers, which are 
connected in parallel. Cylinders 1, 2 and 3 (bank 1) drive the first turbocharger (5) while 
cylinders 4, 5 and 6 (bank 2) drive the second (2). 

The advantage of a small turbocharger lies in the fact that, as the turbocharger runs up to 
speed, the lower moment of inertia of the turbine causes fewer masses to be accelerated, 
and thus the compressor attains a higher boost pressure in a shorter amount of time.

Boost-pressure Control 

The boost pressure of the turbochargers is directly dependent on the flow of exhaust gas 
which reaches the turbocharger turbines. Both the velocity and the mass of the exhaust- 
gas flow are directly dependent on engine speed and engine load. 

The engine-management system uses wastegate valves to control the boost pressure. 
These valves are operated by vacuum-pressure actuators, which are controlled by elec¬ 
tropneumatic pressure transducers via the engine-management system. 

The vacuum pressure is generated by the permanently driven vacuum pump and stored 
in a pressure accumulator. The system is designed to ensure that these loads and 
consumers do not have a negative influence on the brake-boost function. 

The exhaust-gas flow can be completely or partially directed to the turbine wheel with the 
wastegate valves. When the boost pressure has reached its desired level, the wastegate 
valve begins to open and direct part of the exhaust-gas flow past the turbine wheel. 

This prevents the turbine from further increasing the speed of the compressor. 

This control option allows the system to respond to various operating situations.

2007 Engine Management 











In the idle phase, the wastegate valves of both turbochargers are closed. This enables 
the full exhaust-gas flow available to be utilized to speed up the compressor already at 
these low engine speeds. 

When power is then demanded from the engine, the compressor can deliver the reguired 
boost pressure without any noticeable time lag. In the full-load situation, the boost pres¬ 
sure is maintained at a consistently high level when the maximum permissible torgue is 
reached by a partial opening of the wastegate valves. In this way, the compressors are 
only ever induced to rotate at a speed which is called for by the operating situation. 

The process of the wastegate valves opening removes drive energy from the turbine such 
that no further increase in boost pressure occurs, which in turn improves overall fuel 
consumption. 

At full-load the N54 engine operates at an overpressure of up to 0.8 bar in the intake 
manifold. 


13 

2007 Engine Management 



Blow-off Control 

The blow-off valves in the N54 engine reduce unwanted peaks in boost pressure which 
can occur when the throttle valve closes quickly. They therefore have an important 
function with regard to engine acoustics and help to protect the turbocharger compo¬ 
nents. 

A vacuum pressure is generated in the intake manifold when the throttle valve is closed at 
high engine speeds. This leads to a build-up of high dynamic pressure after the 
compressor which cannot escape because the route to the intake manifold is blocked. 

This leads to a "pumping up" of the turbocharger which means that: 

• a clearly noticeable, disruptive pumping noise can be heard, 

• and this pumping noise is accompanied by a component-damaging load being 
exerted on the turbocharger, since high-frequency pressure waves exert axial load on 
the turbocharger bearings

The blow-off valves are mechanically actuated spring-loaded diaphragm valves which are 
activated by the intake-manifold pressure as follows: 

In the event of a pressure differential before and after the throttle valve, the blow-off 
valves are opened by the intake-manifold pressure and the boost pressure is diverted to 
the intake side of the compressor. The blow-off valves open starting from a differential 
pressure of 0.3 bar. This process prevents the disruptive and component-damaging 
pumping effect from occurring. 

The system design dictates that the blow-off valves are also opened during operating 
close to idle (pressure differential Pcharger/Psuction = 0.3 bar). However, this has no 
further effects on the turbocharging system. 

The turbocharger is pressurized with the full exhaust-gas flow at these low speeds and 
already builds up a certain level of induction-air precharging in the range close to idle. 

If the throttle valve is opened at this point, the full boost pressure required is very quickly 
made available to the engine. 

One of the major advantages of the vacuum pressure-actuated wastegate valves is that 
they can be partially opened in the mid-range in order not to allow excessive induction-air 
precharging to the detriment of fuel consumption. In the upper load range, they assume 
the required control position corresponding to the necessary boost pressure. 


15 

2007 Engine Management 



Charge-air Cooling 

Cooling the charge air in the N54 engine serves to increase power output as well as 
reduce fuel consumption. The charge air heated in the turbocharger by its component 
temperature and by compression is cooled in the intercooler by up to 80°C. 

This increases the density of the charge air, which in turn improves the charge in the 
combustion chamber. This results in a lower level of reguired boost pressure. The risk of 
knock is also reduced and the engine operates with improved efficiency. 



Load Control 

Load control of the N54 engine is effected by means of the throttle valve and the waste 
gate valves. 

The throttle valve is the primary component in this process. The wastegate valves are 
actuated to bring about a fine tuning of the boost pressure. At full load the throttle valve 
is completely open and load control is undertaken by the wastegate valves. 

The load-control graphic shows that the wastegate valves are integrated in load control in 
all operating situations of the N54 engine on the basis of map control.

Controlled Variables 

The following variables, among others, influence control of the N54 engine's boost 
pressure: 

• Intake-air temperature 

• Engine speed 

• Throttle-valve position 

• Ambient pressure 

• Intake-manifold pressure 

• Pressure before the throttle valve (reference variable) 

The electropneumatic pressure transducers are activated by the engine control unit on 
the basis of these variables. The result of this activation can be checked from the boost 
pressure achieved, which is measured before the throttle valve. 

There follows a comparison of the boost pressure achieved with the setpoint data from 
the program map, which can if necessary give rise to an activation correction. 

The system therefore controls and monitors itself during operation. 

Limp-home Mode 

In the event during operation of malfunctions, implausible values or failure of any of the 
sensors involved in turbocharger control, activation of the wastegate valves is shut down 
and the valve flaps are thus fully opened. Turbocharging ceases at this point. 

The list below sets out those components or functional groups of the N54 engine in 
which a failure, a malfunction or implausible values result in boost-pressure control being 
deactivated. The driver is alerted to a fault of this type via an EML indication. 

• High-pressure fuel system 

• Inlet VANOS 

• Exhaust VANOS 

• Crankshaft sensor 

• Camshaft sensor 

• Boost-pressure sensor 

• Knock sensors 

• Intake-air temperature sensor 

One principle of vehicle repair is particularly important in this respect: 

It is important to focus on the causes rather than the effects. 


18 

2007 Engine Management 




With regard to the diagnosis and subseguent repair of turbocharging components, it is 
important to ensure that they are also actually identified as defective components with 
the diagnostic technology available. 

It is always vital to ensure that the cause of the fault is determined and rectified and that if 
necessary work is not carried out on symptoms of fault conseguences. 

Thus, for instance, a leaking flange on the intercooler can have far-reaching 
conseguences. 

The N54 engine also is governed by three golden rules of procedure: 

1. Do not rashly trace loss of power and engine malfunctions back to the turbocharger. 
To avoid the replacement of turbochargers which are in perfect working order, the 
following should be observed: 

When blue smoke emerges from the exhaust system, check whether the air cleaner 
is contaminated or the engine is consuming too much oil because of wear. Or, if the 
crankcase ventilation system is faulty. Only then resort to checking the turbocharger. 
If the turbocharger is running too loud, inspect all the connections on the tur¬ 
bocharger pressure side. If black smoke or a loss of power is detected, in this case 
too check the engine and the connecting pipes first. 

2. Main causes of turbocharger damage: 

• Insufficient lubrication and conseguently bearing failure. Compressor and 
turbine wheels will grind in the housings, the seals will be damaged and the 
shaft may also shear off. 

• Foreign bodies damage the turbine and impeller. The resulting imbalance will 
reduce efficiency and may cause the rotors to burst. 

• Contaminated lube oil causes scoring on shaft journals and bearings. Oilways 
and seals will become clogged and cause high oil leakage losses. Elements 
entering the turbocharger system from the outside such as sand, dirt, screws 
and the like will be trapped by a filter before the compressor. 

Service the filters at regular intervals (service intervals). Take care to keep the 
clean-air area of the air cleaner and the air ducting to the compressors clean 
and free from all types of particulates. 

3. Do not make any alterations to the turbocharger. Never attempt to alter the boost- 
pressure control linkage. The turbocharger has been optimally configured at the 
factory. If the turbocharger operates at higher boost pressures than permitted by 
the engine manufacturer, the engine may run hot and pistons, cylinder heads or 
engine bearings may fail, or the safety function of the engine electronics may 
respond and activate the engine's limp-home program.

Air Management N52KP and N51 

As far as the air management system on the N52KP and N51 engines is concerned, the 
previous intake manifold system on the N52 is carried over. Depending upon application, 
the engines will use the 3-stage DISA or the single stage (No DISA) intake manifold. 

For more information on the DISA system refer to the previous training material in the 
training course “ST501 - New Engine Technology”.

Throttle Valve 


On all variants of the new NG6 engines, the throttle valve has been upgraded an is now 
referred to as EGAS 08 by Siemens/VDO. The throttle valve flap itself is now made from 
plastic. 

The primary difference between the new EGAS throttle as compared to the previous unit 
is the throttle feedback system. The previous system used a potentiometer, whereas the 
new throttle uses a “contactless” system featuring magneto-resistive technology. 

The technology is similar to that used on the eccentric shaft sensor on Valvetronic 
systems. 



The magneto-resistive sensor are integrated into the housing cover. This sensor allow 
throttle position feedback to achieve a an extremely high degree of accuracy. 

In the throttle valve, these sensors permit 100 times the power than the previous 
potentiometers and therefore ensure reliable signal progression to the DME. 

The sensors are also non-wearing. The one sensor outputs the analog signal in the 
range from 0.3 to 4.6 V and the other sensor inverts it again from 4.6 to 0.3 V. 

By forming the differential, the ECM calculates the plausibility of the signal. A new plug 
ensures optimum contact guality. In this plug, the contact force acting on the pin is 
decoupled from the plug-in force. 

Conseguently, the contact force is 10 times greater than that of a conventional plug 
connector. 

Note: It is possible to twist the connector before plugging it in. This can cuase 
damage to the harness and connector. BE sure to install connector prop¬ 
erly to avoid damage.

Hot-Film Air Mass Meter 

The HFM on all new NG6 engines has been upgraded to a digital HFM. The output of 
the sensor is a digital signal in which the duty cycle responds to changes in air mass.

Exhaust System 

E92 vehicles with N54 engines are equipped with a dual exhaust system. The entire 
system is made from stainless steel, which ensures that it will function throughout the 
vehicle's service life. 

Upstream primary catalytic converters with downstream underfloor catalytic converters 
are used. The lambda oxygen sensors installed are the same as those in the N52 engine. 

The N51 engine is also equipped with an additional underbody catalyst to complement 
the exisiting “near engine” catalyst. The N51 also features improved catalyst coatings to 
help comply with SULEV II requirements.

Fuel Supply and Management 


Direct injection is one of the most decisive cornerstones in the concept of the N54 
engine. The complex requirements of the combustion process can only be met with this 
injection process, which is described in the following. 

Direct injection achieves a higher compression ratio when compared with a tur¬ 
bocharged engine with manifold injection. At the same time, the exhaust-gas tempera¬ 
ture is reduced under full load. Another advantage of this injection process is the 
improved 

efficiency in part-load operation. 

The N52KP and N51 engines continue to use the conventional “manifold injection” 
system from the N52. 

High Precision Injection (HPI) 

High-precision injection represents the key function in the concept for as economic a 
use of fuel as possible. The new generation of petrol direct injection satisfies the 
expectations placed on it with regard to economic efficiency without compromising on 
the engine's dynamic qualities. 

High-precision injection provides for amore precise metering of mixture and higher 
compression - ideal preconditions for increasing efficiency and significantly reducing 
consumption. 

This is made possible by locating the piezo injector centrally between the valves. In this 
position, the new injector, which opens in an outward direction, distributes a particularly 
uniform amount of tapered shaped fuel into the combustion chamber. 

The new direct injection of BMW HPI spark ignition engines operate according to the 
spray-directed process. 

HPI Function 

The fuel is delivered from the fuel tank by the electric fuel pump via the feed line (5) at an 
“feed” pressure of 5 bar to the high pressure pump. The feed pressure is monitored by 
the low-pressure sensor (6). The fuel is delivered by the electric fuel pump in line with 
demand. 

If this sensor fails, the electric fuel pump continues to run at 100% delivery with terminal 
15 ON. 

The high pressure pump is driven “in-tandem” with the vacuum pump which is driven by 
the oil pump chain drive assembly. 

The fuel is compressed in the permanently driven three-plunger high-pressure pump (8) 
and delivery through the high-pressure line (9) to the rail (3). The fuel accumulated 
under pressure in the rail in this way is distributed via the high-pressure lines (1) to the 
piezo injectors (2). 


24 

2007 Engine Management 




The required fuel delivery pressure is determined by the engine-management system as 
a function of engine load and engine speed. The pressure level reached is recorded by 
the high-pressure sensor (4) and communicated to the engine control unit. 

Control is effected by the fuel-supply control valve (7) by way of a setpoint/actual-value 
adjustment of the rail pressure. Configuration of the pressure is geared towards best 
possible consumption and smooth running of the N54 engine. 200 bar is required only 
at high load and low engine speed.

High Pressure Pump Function and Design 

The fuel is delivered via the supply passage (6) at the admission pressure generated by 
the electric fuel pump to the high-pressure pump. From there, the fuel is directed via the 
fuelsupply control valve (4) and the low-pressure non-return valve (2) into the fuel cham¬ 
ber (14) of the plunger-and-barrel assembly. The fuel is placed underpressure in this 
plunger-and-barrel assembly and delivered via the high pressure non-return valve (9) to 
the highpressure port (7).

2007 Engine Management 




























































































The high-pressure pump is connected with the vacuum pump via the drive flange (11) 
and is thus also driven by the chain drive, i.e. as soon as the engine is running, the three 
plungers (12) are permanently set into up-and-down motion via the pendulum disc (10). 

Fuel therefore continues to be pressurized for as long as new fuel is supplied to the 
high-pressure pump via the fuel-supply control valve (4). The fuel-supply control valve is 
activated by means of the engine management connection (3) and thereby admits the 
quantity of fuel required. 


Pressure control is effected via the fuel-supply control valve by opening and closing of the 
fuel supply channel. The maximum pressure in the high-pressure area is limited to 245 
bar. If excessive pressure is encountered, the high-pressure circuit is relieved by a 
pressure-limiting valve via the ports (8 and 5) leading to the low-pressure area. 

This is possible without any problems because of the incompressibility of the fuel, i.e. the 
fuel does not change in volume in response to a change in pressure. The pressure peak 
created is compensated for by the liquid volume in the low-pressure area. 


Volume changes caused by temperature changes are compensated for by the thermal 
compensator (1), which is connected with the pump oil filling. 


Pressure Generation in High-pressure Pump 

The plunger (2) driven by the pendulum disc presses 
oil (red) into the metal diaphragm (1) on its upward 
travel. The change in volume of the metal diaphragm 
thereby reduces the available space in the fuel 
chamber. The fuel thereby placed under pressure 
(blue) is forced into the rail. 

The fuel-supply control valve controls the fuel 
pressure in the rail. It is activated by the engine 
management system via a pulsewidth modulated 
(PWM) signal. 

Depending on the activation signal, a restrictor cross- 
section of varying size is opened and the fuel-mass 
flow required for the respective load point is set. 
There is also the possibility of reducing the pressure 
in the rail.

Limp-home Mode 

If a fault is diagnosed in the system, such as e.g. failure of the high-pressure sensor, the 
fuel-supply control valve is de-energized; the fuel then flows via a so-called bypass into 
the rail. 

In the event of HPI limp-home mode, turbocharging is deactivated by an opening of the 
wastegate valves. 

Causes of HPI limp-home mode can be: 

• Implausible high-pressure sensor values 

• Failure of the fuel-supply control valve 

• Leakage in the high-pressure system 

• Failure of the high-pressure pump 

• Failure of the high-pressure sensor

Fuel System Safety 

Working on this fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. The 
coolant temperature must not exceed 40 °C. This must be observed without fail because 
otherwise there is a danger of fuel sprayback on account of the residual pressure in the 
high-pressure system. 

When working on the high-pressure fuel system, take particular care to ensure conditions 
of absolute cleanliness and follow the work seguences described in the repair 
instructions. Even the tiniest contaminants and damage to the screw connections on the 
high-pressure lines can cause leaks.

Piezo Fuel Injectors 

It is the outward-opening piezo-injector that renders possible spray-directed direct 
injection and thus the overall innovations of the N54 engine. Due to the fact that only this 
component ensures that the injected fuel spray cone remains stable, even under the pre¬ 
vailing influences of pressure and temperature in the combustion chamber. 

This piezo-injector permits injection pressures of up to 200 bar and extremely guick 
opening of the nozzle needle. In this way, it is possible to inject fuel into the combustion 
chamber under conditions released from the power cycles limited by the valve opening 
times. 



The piezo-injector is integrated together with the spark plug centrally between the inlet 
and exhaust valves in the cylinder head. This installation position prevents the cylinder 
walls or the piston crown from being wetted with injected fuel. A uniform formation of the 
homogeneous air/fuel mixture is obtained with the aid of the gas movement in the com¬ 
bustion chamber and a stable fuel spray cone. 

The gas movement is influenced on the one hand by the geometry of the intake 
passages and on the other hand by the shape of the piston crown. The injected fuel is 
swirled in the combustion chamber with the boost air until a homogeneous mixture is 
available throughout the compression space at the point of ignition. 

Note: When working on the fuel system of the N54 engine, it is important to ensure that 
the ignition coils are not fouled by fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is 
significantly reduced by heavy fuel contact. This can cause sparkover at the spark-plug 
head and with it misfires. 

• Before making modifications to the fuel system, remove the ignition coils without fail 
and protect the spark-plug slot against the ingress of fuel with a cloth. 

• Before refitting the piezo-injector, remove the ignition coils and ensure conditions of 
absolute cleanliness. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced.

Injector Design and Function 

The piezo-injector essentially consists of three sub-assemblies. The expansion of the 
energized piezo-element lifts the nozzle needle outwards from its valve seat. To be able 
to counter the different operating temperatures with comparable valve lifts, the injector 
has a thermal compensating element.

The nozzle needle is pressed outwards 
from its tapered valve seat. This opens up 
an annular orifice. The pressurized fuel 
flows through this annular orifice and forms 
a hollow cone, the spray angle of which is 
not dependent on the backpressure in the 
combustion chamber. 

Note: Do not attempt to clean the 

injectors in anyway. This may 
result in damage which can 
effect the spray pattern. 

Any divergence in the spray 
pattern can cause damage to 
the spark plug orthe engine 
itself.

The spray cone (1) of a piezo-injector can diverge during operation (2). Due to the forma¬ 
tion of soot inside the engine, such divergence is perfectly normal and acceptable to a 
certain extent. If, however, spray divergence reaches the stage where it begins to spray 
the spark plug wet, the spark plug may incur damage.

Note: Replace the Teflon sealing ring when fitting and removing the piezo¬ 
injector. This also applies when an injector that has just been fitted has 
to be removed again after an engine start. 

A piezo-injector provided with a new Teflon sealing ring should be fitted 
as quickly as possible because the Teflon sealing ring could swell up. 
Please observe the repair instructions and follow without fail. 

When fitting, make sure that the piezoinjector is correctly seated. 

The hold-down element for securing the piezo-injectors must rest on 
both injector tabs, otherwise the necessary force is not applied to the 
piezo-injector. Do not clean the nozzle-needle tip of the piezo-injector.

Injection Strategy 

Injection of the fuel mass required for the operating situation can take place in up to three 
individual injections. Which option is used in the relevant operating situation is 
dependent on engine load and speed. Here, the actual time resulting from the engine 
speed available for metering the fuel is an important framework quantity. 

A special situation during the operation of any engine is the range in which a high load 
occurs at low engine speed, so-called "Low End Torque" operation. In this operating 
situation, the required fuel mass is metered to the engine in three individual injections. 

This results in a highly effective mixture formation which in the final analysis has the 
effect of both increasing power output and saving fuel. 

In order to bring the catalytic converters up to operating temperature as quickly as 
possible, the N54 engine has a catalyst-heating mode for when the engine is started from 
cold. In this mode, combustion heat is intentionally introduced into the exhaust train and 
not used first and foremost to develop power output. 

The point of ignition is moved to 30° (crankshaft degrees) afterTDC. The main quantity 
of the required fuel is injected before TDC and mixed with the boost air. The piston is 
situated after TDC in its downward travel such that the air/fuel mixture is already expand¬ 
ing again, which reduces the ignitability of the mixture. 

In order to ignite the mixture reliably, a small residual quantity of fuel is injected 25° after 
TDC and this guarantees an ignitable mixture at the spark plug. This small fuel quantity 
therefore provides for ignition of the residual charge in the combustion chamber. 

This operating mode is set by the engine-management system after a maximum period 
of 60 seconds from engine starting but is terminated if the catalytic-converter response 
temperature is reached earlier.

Piezo Element 

The movement of the nozzle needle in the injector is generated no longer by a solenoid 
coil but rather by a piezo-element. 

A piezo-element is an electromechanical converter, i.e. it consists of a ceramic material 
which converts electrical energy directly into mechanical energy (force/travel). A familiar 
application is the piezo cigarette lighter - when a piezo-crystal is pressed, voltage is 
generated until a spark flashes over and the gas ignites. 


In the case of the piezo-actuator, voltage is generated so that the crystal expands. In order 
to achieve greater travel, it is possible to design a piezo-element in several layers. 


The actuator module consists of layers of the piezo-ceramic material connected 
mechanically in series and electrically in parallel. The deflection of a piezo-crystal is 
dependent on the applied voltage up to a maximum deflection; the higher the voltage, the 
greater the travel.

Injector Adjustment 

When the injectors are manufactured, a multitude of measurement data is recorded at 
specific points in the factory. In this way, the tolerance ranges for injector-guantity 
adjustment are determined and specified in a six-digit number combination. 

Information on the lift performance of the injector is also added for injector voltage 
adjustment. Injector adjustment is reguired because of the individual voltage demand of 
each piezo actuator. An allocation is made to a voltage demand category, which is 
included in the number combination on the injector. 

These data items are transmitted to the ECM. During engine operation, these values are 
used to compensate for deviations in the metering and switching performance. 

Note: When replacing an injector, it is absolutely essentially to carry out an 
injector adjustment. 


34 

2007 Engine Management 












Injector Control and Adaptation 

The fuel mass required for the operating situation is injected by the piezo-injector into the 
combustion chamber. This mass can be influenced by three correcting variables: 

• the rail pressure 

• the injector opening time 

• and the injector opening lift 

The injector opening time and the injector opening lift are activated directly at the piezo 
injector. The opening time is controlled via the ti signal and the opening lift via the energy 
quantity in the activation of the piezo-injector. 

Injector Adaptation 

The fuel masses and injection cycles determined from the load/speed map are included 
in a pilot-control program map. Here, while further framework parameters are taken into 
consideration, the energy quantities and injector opening times required to activate the 
injectors are determined. 

The N54 engine can be safely and reliably operated with these program-map values. 


35 

2007 Engine Management 




Optimization 

For optimization of: 

• Emission values 

• Smooth running 

• Fuel consumption 

• Power output 

the controlled variables of energy quantities and injector opening times are continuously 
monitored. This occurs on a bank-selective basis byway of lambda closed-loop control. 

The residual oxygen in the exhaust gas is measured in each case for cylinder bank 1 and 
cylinder bank 2. This measurement result is compared with the values expected from 
the set correcting variables. The result of a deviation is that the injector opening signal is 
adapted. This adaptation is stored in the control unit and is therefore available for 
subsequent engine operation. Flowever, these stored values are lost when the system is 
flashed and must be relearned. A further adaptation of the injector activation takes place 
depending on time and use. This cylinder-selective adaptation involves a check of the 
residual-oxygen content with a conclusion as to the cylinder causing the situation. To this 
end, it is necessary for part of the exhaust-gas flow not to be swirled in the turbocharger. 
For this reason, the flap of the wastegate valve must be fully opened, i.e. swung out of the 
exhaust-gas flow. This wastegate-flap position extends beyond its normal opening posi¬ 
tion in engine operation. Based on the result of this cylinder-selective monitoring, the 
nergy quantity is adapted if necessary to activate the injectors. 

Furthermore, the cylinder-selective adaptation includes if necessary an adaptation of the 
injector opening signal based on smooth running monitoring of the N54 engine. Overall 
adaptation of the injectors is limited to a 15% additional quantity.

Ignition Management 


Most of the ignition system components have remained the same for all NG6 engines 
for 2007. There are some minor changes to the ignition coils that apply to all versions. 
The coils have been optimized for more durability. 

Spark Plugs 

The spark plugs for the N51 and N52KP remain the same as N52. However, the N54 
uses a completely new spark plug from Bosch. The spark plug design consists of a 
12mm thread which contrasts from the 14mm design on the N52 which prevents any 
possibility of improper installation. The hex on the spark plug is also a 12 point design 
which reguires a special tool. The tool (socket) has a “thinwall” design to facilitate 
access in the confined area of the N54 cylinder head. 



38 

2007 Engine Management 




Spark Plug Diagnosis (N54) 

Due to the proximity of the spark plug to the fuel injector nozzle, any divergence in the 
fuel spray may cause possible spark plug damage. This makes spark plug diagnosis an 
important part of N54 service concerns. Information gained by the spark plug diagnosis 
may indicate possible fuel injector faults. Spark plug replacement interval has been 
reduced to 45,000 miles for the N54. 

The illustrations below can be used to assist in spark plug diagnosis: 



The spark plug above shows a normal wear patttern 
with no excessive electrode wear or insulator 
damage. 


The spark plug above shows a normal wear patttern

Emissions Management 


The N54 and N52KP meet ULEV II requirements for 2007. There are not many 
changes to the emissiom systems on these engines. The N54 engine has 2 underbody 
catalysts in addition to the “near engine” catalysts already in use from the N52. 

The N51 engine, however, is a SULEVII compliant engine which meets the 2007 
requirements. In addition to the 5 exisiting SULEV states of California, New York, Maine, 
Massachusetts, and Vermont - four states have been added for 2007. These states 
include, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Oregon and Washington State. 

The N51 emissions measures include: 

• Secondary Air System with mini-HFM 

• Radiator with “Prem-air” coating 

• Lower compression ratio (10:1) via modified combustion chamber and pistons 

• Underbody catalyst in addition to “near engine” catalyst 

• Activated carbon air filter in air filter housing 

• Steel fuel lines with threaded fittings and sealed fuel tank 

• Crankcase ventilation system integrated into cylinder head cover 

• Purge system piping made from optimized plastic 

Note: The SULEV II information above is only preliminary and is accurate as of 
8/06. Additional information will be released as it becomes available.

Cooling System 

The cooling system of the N54 engine consists of a radiator circuit and an isolated 
oil cooling circuit. The fact that there is an isolated oil-cooling circuit ensures that heat is 
not introduced via the engine oil into the engine's coolant system.

There is a significantly greater quantity of heat on account of this engine's increased 
power of 75.5 kW/l in comparison with other 3-liter spark-ignition engines. 

This boundary condition is satisfied by the engine cooling system with its increased 
performance. This increase in power was to be realized in spite of some factors less 
advantageous to cooling. 

Factors to be mentioned here are: 

• Approximately 15% less flow area is available on account of the intercooler located 
below the radiator. 

• The already small amount of space provided by the engine compartment is further 
limited by the accommodation of further components. 

• Because the exhaust turbochargers are cooled by the coolant, an additional quantity 
of heat is introduced into the system via these turbochargers. 

Measures for increasing cooling-system performance: 

• Coolant pump with increased power - 400 W/9000 l/h 

• Separation of water and engine-oil cooling 

• Radiator with increased power 

• Electric fan with increased power 600W for all gearbox variants 
Charge-air cooling is described in the section dealing with air-intake ducting. 


43 

2007 Engine Management 



































Cooling System Overview 

The structure of the coolant circuit is the same as that of the N52 engine. The engine is 
flushed through with coolant in accordance with the cross-flow concept. Cooling output 
can be influenced as a function of load by activating the following components: 

• Electric fan 


• Electric coolant pump 

• Map thermostat 


It is also possible in an N54 engine in conjunction with an automatic gearbox to utilize the 
lower area of the radiator to cool the gearbox by means of the gearbox-oil cooler. This is 
achieved as in the N52 engine with control sleeves, which are introduced into the radiator 
tank. 



Radiator 

Design measures have been used to increase the performance of the radiator itself. 
The performance of a radiator is dependent on its radiation surface. However, the 
intercooler still had to be installed underneath the radiator, and this meant that is was 
necessary to compensate for the smaller flow area available. 

Compared with the N52 engine, the radiator used in the N54 engine has a block depth 
which has been increased to 32 mm. In addition, the water pipes are situated closer 
together than in previously used radiators. The upshot of this is an increase in the 
utilizable radiation surface.

Electric Coolant Pump 

The coolant pump of the N54 engine is an electrically driven centrifugal pump with a 
power output of 400W and a maximum flow rate of 9000 l/h. This represents a significant 
increase in power of the electric coolant pump used in the N52 engine, which has a 
power output of 200 W and a maximum flow rate of 7000 l/h.

Electronics for coolant pump

Motor 




The power of the electric wet-rotor motor is electronically controlled by the electronic 
module (3) in the pump. The electronic module is connected via the bit-serial data inter¬ 
face (BSD) to the MSD80 engine control unit. 

The engine control unit uses the engine load, the operating mode and the data from the 
temperature sensors to calculate the reguired cooling output. Based on this data, the 
engine control unit issues the corresponding command to the electric coolant pump. 

The electric coolant pump regulates its speed in accordance with this command. 

The system coolant flows through the motor of the coolant pump, thus cooling both the 
motor as well as the electronic module. The coolant lubricates the bearings of the 
electric coolant pump. 

Note: The same rules apply to all electric coolant pumps. The pump must be 
filled with coolant when removed for service to prevent any corrosion. 
Also, the pump impeller must be turned by hand before installation to 
ensure the pump is not siezed. 


45 

2007 Engine Management 

















































































Engine-oil Cooling 

The N54 engine is equipped with a highperformance engine-oil cooler. The pendulum- 
slide pump delivers the oil from the oil sump to the oil filter. A thermostat flanged to the 
oil-filter housing admits the oil to the engine-oil cooler. The engine-oil cooler is located in 
the right wheel arch in the E92. The thermostat can reduce the resistance opposing the 
oil by opening the bypass line between the feed and return lines of the engine-oil cooler. 
This ensures that the engine warms up safely and quickly.

46 

2007 Engine Management 














Heat Management 


The engine control unit of the N54 engine controls the coolant pump according to 
reguirements: 

• Low output in connection with low cooling reguirements and low outside 
temperatures 

• High output in connection with high cooling reguirements and high outside 
temperatures 

The coolant pump may also be completely switched off under certain circumstances, 
e.g. to allow the coolant to heat up rapidly during the warm-up phase. However, this only 
occurs when no heating is reguired and the outside temperature is within the permitted 
range. 

The coolant pump also operates differently than conventional pumps when controlling 
the engine temperature. To date, only the currently applied temperature could be 
controlled by the thermostat. 

The software in the engine control unit now features a calculation model that can take 
into account the development of the cylinder head temperature based on load. 

In addition to the characteristic map control of the thermostat, the heat management 
system makes it possible to use various maps for the purpose of controlling the coolant 
pump. For instance, the engine control unit can adapt the engine temperature to match 
the current operating situation. 

This means that four different temperature ranges can be implemented: 

• 108°C ECO mode 

• 104°C Normal mode 

• 95°C High mode 

• 90°C High + map-thermostat mode 

The control system aims to set a higher cylinder-head temperature (108°C) if the engine 
control unit determines ECO (economy) mode based on the engine performance. 

The engine is operated with relatively low fuel consumption in this temperature range as 
the internal friction is reduced. 

An increase in temperature therefore favors slower fuel consumption in the low load 
range. In HIGH and map-thermostat mode, the driver wishes to utilize the optimum 
power development of the engine. The cylinder-head temperature is reduced to 90°C for 
this purpose. This results in improved volumetric efficiency, thus increasing the engine 
torgue. The engine control unit can now set a certain temperature mode adapted to the 
respective operating situation. Conseguently, it is possible to influence fuel 
consumption and power output by means of the cooling system. 


47 

2007 Engine Management 



The temperatures specified only ever represent a target value, the attainment of which is 
dependent on many factors. These temperatures are first and foremost not attained 
precisely. 

The consumption-reducing and power increasing effects arise in each case in a 
temperature spectrum. The function of the cooling system is to provide the optimal 
cooling output according to the boundary conditions under which the engine is being 
operated. 

Intelligent Heat Management Options 

The previous section dealt with the various temperature ranges in which heat 
management is effected. However, an electrically driven coolant pump makes available 
even further options. For instance, it is now possible to warm up the engine without 
recirculating the coolant or to allow the pump to continue to operate after turning off the 
engine to facilitate heat dissipation. The advantages offered by this type of pump are 
listed in the following table: 


Consumption 

• Faster warm-up as coolant is not recirculated 
until needed 

• Increased compression ratio due to greater cool¬ 
ing output all full load as compared to similar 
engines without this option 

Emissions 

• Faster engine warm-up by drastically reduced 
pump speed and the lower volumetric flow of 
coolant 

• Reduced friction 

• Reduced fuel consumption 

• Reduced exhaust emissions 

Power Output 

• Component cooling independent of engine 
speed 

• Reguirement controlled coolant pump output 

• Avoidance of power loss 

Comfort 

• Optimum volumetric flow 

- Heating capacity reduced as reguired 

- Residual heat with engine stationary 

Component Protection 

• After-running of electric coolant pump = 

improved heat dissipation from engine switch off 
point. Allows protection of turbochargers by 
reduced oil “coking” during heat soak. 


48 

2007 Engine Management 














System Protection 

In the event of the coolant or engine oil being subject to excessive temperatures while the 
engine is running, certain functions in the vehicle are influenced so that more energy is 
made available to the engine-cooling system, i.e. temperature-increasing loads are 
avoided.
