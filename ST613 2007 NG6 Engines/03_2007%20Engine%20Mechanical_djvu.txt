Engine Construction 


Of the three new 6-cylinder engines for 2007, the N54 has perhaps the most changes in 
comparison with the N52. Beginning with the crankcase, the N54 engine uses an all 
aluminum alloy block with cast cylinder liners. The aluminum crankcase is pressure cast 
and differs from the “insert” design of the N52. This design is in contrast to the previous 
composite magnesium/aluminum crankcase on the N52. The construction of the N54 
crankcase is to accommodate the increased torgue output of the turbocharged N54. 

Dimensionally, the N54 crankcase is the same as the N52 and continues to use the 
2-piece crankcase with bedplate. There are some slight differences regarding the bolt 
pattern for the transmission mounting. This reguires a new engine mounting bracket 
when installing on to the engine stand. 

All aluminum (AL226 alloy) crankcase - N54 



The crankshaft is forged steel on the N54 engine. The crankshaft on the N52KP and 
N51 engines remains cast iron as on the original N52.

Engine Mechanical Changes 


Bolts 

As with the N52, the N54 continues to use the aluminum bolts for most fastening duties 
Even though the N54 is an all aluminum crankcase, the aluminum bolts are used to 
reduce any confusion. This decreases the possibility of any incorrectly installed bolts of 
the wrong material (steel vs. aluminum). Of course, the N52KP and N51 still retains the 
use of aluminum bolts as well. 



The same rules apply to the handling and installation of aluminum bolts as in the past. 
Strict adherence to repair instructions is reguired to ensure proper connections. 

Be sure to use the proper torgue/tightening angle seguence as indicated in the 
“tightening torgues” section of TIS.

Cylinder Head Cover 

The cylinder head covers on all of the new engines have changed. While the N52 uses a 
magnesium cylinder head cover, the new engines use a plastic cover. The N52KP and 
N51 use the same basic design to accommodate the VVT motor and new crankcase 
ventilation system. In comparison, the N54 uses a completely different design. This is 
due to the lack of Valvetronic and the modified crankcase ventilation system. 

The bolts that secure the cylinder head cover are steel.

Cylinder Head 

As far as the cylinder head designs are concerned, all three of the new engines use a 
different cylinder head. While all of the heads are made from aluminum, they differ due to 
the design requirements. For example, the N54 does not use Valvetronic and requires 
accommodation for the fuel injectors for direct injection. The N52KP engine uses a cylin¬ 
der head which is mostly identical to the N52. The N51, which is a SULEVII design, 
uses a lower compression ratio and therefore a different cylinder head with a modified 
combustion chamber.

Valvetrain 

With regard to the valvetrain changes, the intake valves still use the 5mm stem from the 
N52. However, the exhaust valves have been upgraded to a 6mm valve stem for 
increased durability. The 6mm exhaust stem has also been in production on the current 
N52 since 3/06. 

The valves have solid construction and the valve head diameters are engine specific.

Camshafts 

All of the new engine variants will take 
advantage of the lightweight, hydroformed 
camshafts from the N52. For supply and 
production reasons, it is possible that some 
engines may be fitted with cast camshafts. 

Conseguently, it is possible to interchange 
these camshafts with no problem. Cast 
camshafts and hydroformed camshafts can 
be fitted as replacement parts. It is even 
possible to have cast and hydroformed 
camshafts on the same engine as well. 



VANOS 

The infinitely variable double VANOS system is still in use on all NG6 engines. The sys¬ 
tem still retains the use of the lightweight VANOS units from the N52. The only change 
to the system is that the N54 uses different spread ranges as compared to the other 
engines (N52, N52KP and N51). As with the previous systems, the VANOS units should 
not be mixed up as the spread ranges for the intake and exhaust are different and engine 
damage could result.

Valvetronic 

The N52KP and N51 retain the already proven Valvetronic system. The only changes to 
the system for 2007 is an optimized VVT motor. 

On the other hand, the N54 engine does NOT use Valvetronic. This is due to the fact 
that the Valvetronic system is designed to reduce pumping losses. It is a system which 
improves volumetric efficiency by optimizing the air charge. 

A turbocharger system is also designed to increase volumetric efficiency by reducing 
pumping losses. Therefore, there is no need for both of these systems to be employed 
on the same engine. The N54 gains maximum efficiency by the use of turbocharging 
and direct injection.

Gaskets and Seals 

The gasket design on the new engines is mostly similar to the N52. The N54 uses a 
specific head gasket for use with the turbocharged application. The head gasket is a 
multi-layered design which does not have the protruding lip as on the N52. This lip is not 
needed due to the fact that the cylinder head is aluminum and contact corrosion is not an 
issue. 

The split crankcase still uses the injected sealant carried over from the N52. 

Piston and Connecting Rods 

As with the cylinder head, the piston designs differ between engines. The N54 uses a 
special piston for compatibility with the direct injection system. The piston crown is 
modified to meet the mixture formation reguirements. 

The N51 engine uses a lower compression ratio and accordingly uses a different piston 
design. The N52KP uses the same design as the N52 engine. 

The connecting rods on all of the NG6 engines have been stiffened with a thicker beam 
on the rod. This design has also been in production on the N52 since 6/06. 

Crankshaft 

The cast iron crankshaft is retained for the N52KP and N51. To accommodate the 
increased power output of the N54, the crankshaft is forged steel. 

Torsional Vibration Damper 

The torsional vibration damper has need optimized to improve damping of first order 
vibrations. The damper is secured with new bolts and the tightening procedure has been 
changed. These procedures should not be confused with the N52 as damage to the belt 
drive could result.

Crankcase Ventilation 

There are two basic methods for ventilating the crankcase which have been in use a 
BMW engines. One of the methods uses a crankcase ventilation valve and the other 
does not. In either case, the crankcase vapors must be metered into the intake and the 
oil must be separated from the vapors. 

The basic crankcase ventilation system is shown below. It features the “labyrinth” 
method of oil separation which uses a maze of channels to divide the crankcase vapor 
from the liquid oil. The vapors can enter the engine through a “calibrated” orifice, while to 
liquid oil returns back into the engine or oil sump. 



In the case of the three new NG6 engines, there are two methods employed. The N54 
engine does not use a crankcase ventilation valve and oil is separated using the “cyclonic 
method”. 

The N52KP and N51 engines use a crankcase ventilation valve and the “labyrinth” 
method of oil separation.

N54 Crankcase Ventilation 

The crankcase ventilation system on the N54 engine is unique due to the fact that this is 
a turbocharged engine. This means the the intake manifold pressure will be higher than 
that of a naturally aspirated engine. This presents new challenges regarding the design 
of the crankcase ventilation system. 

The basic description of the system is as follows: 

• The system uses a calibrated orifice to meter crankcase vapors into the engine 

• Liquid oil is separated from the crankcase vapors is done by “cyclonic” action 

• There are 2 channels for crankcase vapors depending upon the manifold pressure 

• Most of the system components are integrated into the cylinder head cover 

One of the most important features is the fact that most of the system components are 
integrated into the plastic cylinder head cover. This allows engine heat to warm the 
crankcase vapors which prevents any potential freezing of any water vapor trapped in the 
system. In contrast to the N52, there is only one heating element located at the intake 
manifold inlet. 

Cyclone Separator 

A cyclone oil separator is used in the N54 engine. Here, four of the described cyclones 
are integrated into the oil-separator housing. The oil mist drawn in from the crankcase is 
set into a spinning motion in the cyclone. As a result of the centrifugal forces, the heavier 
oil settles on the cyclone walls and from there drips into the oil drain. 

The lighter blow-by gases are sucked out from the middle of the cyclone. The purified 
blow-by gases are then fed to the air-intake system.

Crankcase Ventilation System Function 

The crankcase ventilation system of the N54 must be capable of venting the crankcase 
during two different modes of engine operation. When the engine is in deceleration, the 
intake manifold pressure is low (high vacuum). During acceleration or idling, the intake 
manifold pressure is higher (low vacuum). Therefore the system operates differently in 
these modes. This is what is unigue about the crankcase venting system on the N54.

Operation with Low Manifold Pressure 

When the engine has low manifold pressure such as in decel, the crankcase vapors are 
routed through a channel (15) between the cylinder head cover and intake manifold. The 
liguid oil is separated before the channel in the cyclonic separators (3) in the cylinder 
head cover. The liguid oil returns to the engine via the oil discharge valve (4). 

The channel contains a pressure restrictor (16) which regulates the flow of crankcase 
vapors. During deceleration, the crankcase vapors (E) are directed via a check valve (14) 
which is located in the cylinder head cover. The check valve is opened when low 
pressure is present in the intake manifold (throttle closed). 

Also, a PTC heater has been integrated into the intake manifold inlet. The inlet pipe is 
connected to the channel (15) and prevent any moisture from freezing at the inlet.

Operation with High Manifold Pressure 

When in turbocharged mode, the pressure in the intake manifold increases and then 
closes the check valve (14). Now, a low pressure is present in the charge air suction line 
(10). This causes a low pressure in the hose (11) leading to the manifold check valve 
(12). The crankcase vapors (after separation) are directed through the check valve (12) 
into the charge air suction line (10) and ultimately back into the engine. The check valve 
(12) also prevent boost pressure from entering the crankcase when the intake manifold 
pressure is high.

Note: Be aware that any check valve failure could cause excessive oil con¬ 
sumption possibly accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust. This 
should not be mistaken for a failed turbocharger. Always perform a com 
plete diagnosis of the crankcase ventilation system, before replacing 
any turbocharger or associated components.

Crankcase Ventilation N52KP and N51 

The crankcase ventilation system on the N52KP and N51 uses a crankcase ventilation 
valve which is incorporated into the cylinder head cover. Oil is separated via an internal 
labyrinth which is also incorporated into the cylinder head cover. 

This system, like the N54, also benefits from the integral components. This design 
allows engine heat to warm the crankcase vapors which decreases the likelihood of any 
moisture freezing in the system during conditions of low ambient temperature.
