New BMW 8-Cylinder Technology 


As the successor to the N62 engine, the N63 was developed 
based on the principles of "Efficient Dynamics". Efficient 
Dynamics combines driving enjoyment with efficiency which, in a 
new engine, is expressed in increased power output together with 
reduced fuel consumption. 

One of the ways of achieving this objective is through downsizing. 
This means the same power output is achieved with reduced 
engine displacement or higher power output at the same engine 
displacement. 

Both objectives apply to the N63 engine. Compared to the N62 
engine, the power output has been boosted while decreasing the 
engine displacement. 




In comparison, the N62TU has a displacement of 4.8 liters, 
while the new N63 engine displaces only 4.4 liters. 

This is primarily achieved by technologies that already gave the 
N54 engine its legendary dynamics and outstanding efficiency: 
Bi-turbocharging in connection with high precision injection. 

The N63 is the first engine world-wide to feature an optimized 
package, involving the integration of the turbocharger and the 
main near-engine catalytic converters in the “v-space”. 

With the aim of achieving the demanding performance objectives 
in connection with optimum package and weight, the exhaust 
turbochargers and the catalytic converters have been placed in 
the v-space between the cylinder banks resulting in the intake and 
exhaust ports changing places. 

With short pipe lengths and larger cross sections, this arrange¬ 
ment minimizes the pressure losses on the intake and exhaust 
side.

Compared to it’s predecessor, the N62TU, the new N63 engine is characterized by distinctly higher output. It has an impressive torque 
curve which not only peaks earlier (at 1750 RPM), but is also very “flat” which is a characteristic of BMW turbocharged engines.

Overview of Engine Changes 

The latest generation of BMW V-8 engines differs from past designs in several areas. Although all of these engines have been derived 
from the M60 engine from 1993, the N63 engine design is a departure from the original design. 

The following chart will point out some of the differences where the N63 is unique and distinct. The information found below outlines the 
new engine technology as compared to previously known systems. The features are organized by engine system and are divided into the 
following categories: 

• New Development - this is a system or component which has never been used previously on a BMW engine. 

• New Design - this is a system or component which has been specifically developed for the N63 engine, but does not represent 
a technical innovation. 

• Technology carried over from N54 - This represents technology already known from the N54 engine and adapted to the N63.

Engine Housing Components 


Crankcase 

The crankcase of the N63 engine is a new design based on the closed-deck principle with lower-set side walls. It is made of an aluminum 
alloy (Alusil) with honed cylinder liners. Similar to the N62 engine, a double main bearing bolting with additional side wall mounting is 
used. There is now no coolant reservoir in this area due to the new arrangement of the turbochargers in the V-space. 




Oil Pan 

The 2-piece aluminum oil pan accommodates the oil filter housing and the front differential on all wheel drive vehicles. It is also important 
to note that the engine oil dipstick has been eliminated as on the New Generation 6-cylinder engines. Oil level monitoring is now carried 
out electronically as in those models.

Cylinder Head Covers 

The cylinder head covers are made from aluminum alloy. There are 
accommodations for the the ignition coils, camshaft sensors and 
the mounting for the high pressure fuel pump.

— e ■, 





Cyclone separators are contained within the cylinder head covers 
as replaceable plastic components. There are no crankcase 
ventilation valves on the N63 engine, but there are externally 
mounted check valves similar to the N54. 

Cylinder Head 

The most distinctive new feature on the cylinder head of the N63 
engine is the inverse arrangement of the intake and exhaust ports. 

At the same time, optimized cross flow through the coolant jacket 
from the intake to exhaust side has been achieved. 



The intake port features a trailing edge for creating more intensive 
charge movement. The fuel injectors and spark plugs are arranged 
transversely adjacent to each other in the center of the combustion 
chamber roof. 

There is now only one non-return valve for the oil circuit integrated 
in the cylinder head. The two non-return valves that were used for 
VANOS are now integrated in the VANOS units. 

















Engine Internal Components 

Crankshaft 

To reduce weight, the main bearing diameters of the crankshaft 
have been reduced from 70 mm to 65 mm. The crankshaft is a 
forged steel unit and contains an integrated sprocket for the oil 
pump. 



The oil pump on the N63 engine is driven by the crankshaft on the 
flywheel side. The sprocket is built directly into the crankshaft. 



Timing Gear 

A newly developed tooth-roller chain is used per cylinder bank to 
drive the camshafts. This chain combines the advantages of a 
toothtype chain and a roller chain, i.e. high resistance to wear and 
low running noise. 

The chain tensioners, tensioning and slide rails are common parts 
for both cylinder banks. The oil spray nozzles are integrated in the 
chain tensioners. 

The N63 engine is no longer locked at ignition TDC of the first 
cylinder but rather at 150° before ignition TDC of the first cylinder. 

To block off the engine, a special tool is placed on the torsional 
vibration damper thus forming the reference for the plug mandrel to 
the crankcase. 

Lubrication System 

The lubrication system utilizes the same volumetric flow-controlled 
oil pump as seen on the six-cylinder N52/N54 engine. This type of 
oil pump offers the same reduction in fuel consumption as on past 
designs. The main difference on the N63 is that the oil pump is 
chain driven off of the rear of the engine rather than the front as on 
previous V-8 engines.

Camshafts 

Recent advancements in engine technology have brought about 
new camshaft designs. Most modern BMW engines use some 
form of composite camshafts which are assembled from individual 
components rather than machined from an solid cast iron blank. 
This technology not only provides a reduction in manufacturing 
costs, but also a considerable weight savings. 


The N63 engine has assembled camshafts of the type as used on 
the M73 engine. All components are shrink-fitted on to the shaft. 


The illustration shows the different components of the camshafts. 

The drive flange, the wrench flats and the flats for the special tool 
are made from one single component. A three-point cam that 
drives the high pressure pump of the fuel system is additionally 
mounted on the exhaust camshafts. It is located after the first/fifth 
cylinder. 

Another special feature of the N63 engine is that the exhaust 
camshafts for cylinders 2, 4, 7 and 8 produce a different valve lift 
curve than for cylinders 1, 3, 5 and 6. The exhaust valves of 
cylinders 2, 4, 7 and 8 open later, they have a shorter opening peri¬ 
od and a smaller valve lift for even smoother engine operation.

Infinitely Variable Double VANOS 

The charge cycle in the N63 engine is realized with four valves per 
cylinder, which are driven by two overhead camshafts. 

The engine timing can be variably influenced by means of the two 
infinitely variable VANOS units. 

The VANOS units used here have the following timing angles: 

• Intake VANOS unit: 50° crankshaft angle 

• Exhaust VANOS unit: 50° crankshaft angle 

The VANOS units on the N63 engine differ from the VANOS units 
on the N62 engine. The function is identical but some compo¬ 
nents have been omitted and the VANOS unit has been optimized. 

On the N63 engine, the individual vanes of the VANOS unit are no 
longer individual parts but rather they have been further developed 
to form an oscillating rotor (as on the N52 engine). 

The torsion spring integrated in the N62 VANOS unit is now 
designed as a coil spring accommodated on the front of the N63 
VANOS unit protected by a plastic cover.

Lubrication System 

In the same way as the 6-cylinder engines, the N63 engine is now 
eguipped with a volumetric flow controlled oil pump. It is driven by 
the crankshaft on the flywheel side. 

The oil pump is designed as a sliding-vane positive displacement 
pump with a control system that also operates in the same way as 
on the 6- cylinder engines. 


The difference is that the oil pressure does not act on the control 
piston but rather directly on the slide. The oil pressure that acts on 
the slide is tapped off downstream of the oil filter and cooler, i.e. the 
pressure prevailing in the system. 

Advantage of volumetric flow-controlled oil pump 

The oil pump uses a considerable proportion of the engine power 
output. VANOS reguires a large volume of oil for the purpose of 
adjusting the camshaft angle. On the other hand, VANOS requires 
no oil flow for retaining the camshaft angle. 

Consequently, the oil requirement depends on the extent of the 
adjustment operations. Conventional oil pumps produce the oil 
pressure necessary for the largest possible oil flow rate that can 
occur in the engine. In many operating situations, this represents 
unnecessary energy consumption through the oil pump and addi¬ 
tional wear of the oil. 

The volumetric flow-controlled oil pump delivers only as much oil 
as is necessary under the respective engine operating conditions. 
No surplus quantities of oil are delivered in low-load operating 
ranges, thus reducing fuel consumption and oil wear and tear.

Functional principle of volumetric flow-controlled oil pump 

The pump is designed as a sliding-vane positive displacement 
pump. In delivery mode, the pump shaft is positioned off-center in 
the housing and the vanes are displaced radially during rotation. 

As a result, the vanes form chambers of differing volume. The oil is 
drawn in as the volume increases and, conversely, expelled into the 
oil channels as the volume decreases. 

The oil pressure in the system (downstream of the oil filter and oil 
cooler) acts on the slide against the force of a compression spring 
in the control oil chamber. The slide element can rotate about a 
pivot pin. 









































The pressure increases in the system when less oil is required by 
the lubricating system than the pump delivers. As a result, the 
pressure in the control chamber also increases thus turning the 
slide so that the pump shaft is located more in the center of the 
slide, thus reducing the change in volume and therefore the deliv¬ 
ered quantity. 

If the oil required by the engine increases, for example, VANOS 
control intervention, the pressure in the lubricating system drops 
and is therefore also reduced in the control oil chamber. 

The compression spring moves the slide such that the pump shaft 
is off-center, thus increasing the change in volume and therefore 
the delivered quantity. 

Pressure Relief Valve 

The pressure relief valve is integrated in the oil pump. Pressure 
upstream of the filter is applied to the valve which opens at a pres¬ 
sure of approximately 18 bar. When opened, the valve allows 
surplus oil to flow directly into the oil pan. 

Oil Filter 

The N63 engine is equipped with the standard full flow oil filter. 

It is screwed into the oil pan from below. It also features an inte¬ 
grated filter bypass valve. The valve opens when the filter is dirty 
and ensures that the lubrication points still receive engine oil (albeit 
unfiltered). 

No drain valve is fitted due to its installation position. A drain plug in 
the oil filter cover makes it possible to drain the oil out of the filter 
housing before the oil filter cover is opened. 

Oil Cooling 

The oil is cooled via an oil-to-air heat exchanger. This separate oil 
cooler is located to the right of the cooling module. A thermostat 
only allows the oil to flow through the oil cooler when a defined oil 
temperature has been reached, thus ensuring the engine oil heats 
up at a rapid rate. 


Oil Spray Nozzles 

Oil spray nozzles are used at points that cannot be reached by oil 
channels. On the N63 engine, these are the standard oil spray 
nozzles for piston crown cooling and the oil spray nozzles for 
lubricating the timing chain. 

Oil spray nozzles for piston crown cooling 

The N63 engine has four double oil spray nozzles for cooling the 
piston crowns. Each oil spray nozzle cools an opposing pair of 
cylinders. 

A piston cooling valve is integrated in the oil spray nozzle. 

This valve ensures that the oil circuit is not drained via the oil spray 
nozzles while the engine is not running. 

Oil spray nozzles for timing chain lubrication 

The oil spray nozzles for lubricating the timing chains are integrated 
in the chain tensioners of the two cylinder banks. They spray the 
engine oil directly on to the timing chains. A throttle in the oil spray 
nozzle limits the oil output. 

Chain Tensioner 

The N63 engine is equipped with one chain tensioner per cylinder 
bank. It is a hydraulic chain tensioner that acts on a tensioning rail. 

Chain tensioners always act on the no-load side of the chain, i.e. 
the slack side. 

Non-return Valves in Cylinder Head 

Non-return valves that prevent the oil channels in the cylinder head 
draining while the engine is not running are normally installed in the 
cylinder head. 

There is only one non-return valve in the cylinder head of the N63 
engine. The nonreturn valves for VANOS units are now directly 
integrated in the solenoid valves.

Crankcase Ventilation System 

The crankcase breather on the N63 engine operates in accordance 
with the same principle as on the N54 engine. In the case of the 
N63 engine, each cylinder bank has its own crankcase breather. 

The crankcase ventilation on the N63 operates in two modes, 
similar to the N54. One mode is for turbocharged operation and 
the other is for “naturally aspirated mode” which is usually under 
deceleration.

Crankcase breather, naturally-aspirated engine operation 

Because of its exhaust-gas turbocharging, in the same way as the 
N54 engine, the N63 engine is equipped with a special crankcase 
breather. 

The standard function can only be utilized while there is a vacuum 
in the intake manifold, i.e. in naturally-aspirated engine operation. 

As soon as the pressure in the intake manifold is increased by 
turbocharging, the blow-by gasses can no longer be introduced by 
way of this route. A non-return valve is incorporated in the channel 
to the intake manifold to prevent the risk of boost pressure being 
introduced into the crankcase. 

There is a risk, under conditions of high vacuum, that oil can be 
drawn in through the crankcase breather into the intake manifold. 
So, this area of the crankcase breather must be provided with a 
pressure limiting facility. 
























































































•£>• . 1 / 


This is realized in the N63 engine with a restrictor, which limits the 
throughflow and thus also the pressure level in the crankcase 
breather. As the illustration shows, ventilation takes place during 
naturally aspirated operation via an external line from the cylinder 
head cover to the intake manifold. 

The throttle for limiting pressure on the N63 is integrated in the 
non-return valve to the intake manifold. 


Crankcase breather, turbocharged operation 

In turbocharged mode, the pressure in the intake manifold increas¬ 
es and thus closes the non-return valve. Because there is a vacu¬ 
um in the clean-air pipe in this operating range, it opens the non¬ 
return valve to the clean-air pipe and the blow-by gasses are direct¬ 
ed via the turbocharger compressor and the intercooler into the 
intake manifold.

Oil Separator 

Labyrinth and cyclone oil separators are used on the N63 engine. 
One labyrinth separator and four cyclone separators are integrated 
in the oil separator housing of each cylinder bank, however, only 
three are used at present. 

The fourth is reserved for further developments. The oil mist drawn 
out of crankcase is routed through the labyrinth. This serves as the 
first oil separation stage as the oil collects on the walls of the 
labyrinth and flows off. The further flow of blow-by-gas is made to 
swirl in the cyclones. 

As a result of the centrifugal forces, the heavier oil settles on the 
cyclone walls and from there drips into the oil drain. The lighter 
blow-by gas is drawn out from the middle of the cyclone. 

The cleaned blow-by gas is then fed to the air intake system.

Note: If the exhaust system produces blue smoke, it is 
necessary to check whether the engine is also 
drawing oil into the combustion chamber through the 
crankcase breather, which suggest that there is a 
fault in the area of the crankcase breather. A clear 
sign of a problem is an oiled up clean-air pipe. 








































Belt Drive 

The N63 engine is equipped as standard with a double belt drive. 
The main belt drive features a mechanical tensioning pulley that 
provides the necessary tension in the poly-V-belt. 

The A/C compressor is driven by a ELAST drive belt which is 
mounted and tensioned in a new way.

The belt pulley on the torsion¬ 
al vibration damper can be 
shifted in a defined position in 
the direction of the A/C com¬ 
pressor. This makes it possi¬ 
ble to easily install the ELAST 
drive belt without the need for 
special tools. 

This is made possible by an 
eccentric slot in the belt pul¬ 
ley, which allows the crank¬ 
shaft to be shifted in radial 
direction after the four mount¬ 
ing screws holding the belt 
pulley have been removed. 
The tension in the ELAST 
drive belt pulls the belt pulley

Prepare to remove cylinder heads. Rotate engine to the indicated position in the repair instructions (pic A). Keep in mind that the 
N63, unlike previous BMW engines, is not set up on ignition TDC at #1 cylinder. Actually, when removing the cylinder heads and 
setting camshaft timing, the engine is locked at 150 degrees BTDC. This arrangement ensures that no pistons are at TDC during 
cylinder head removal and installation which prevents potential valve damage while servicing. 


The first step is to attach special tools as shown in picture B and C (engine should only be rotated clockwise).

MSD85 Engine Management 


Due to the changes brought about with the new N63 engine, the 
engine management system has been adapted accordingly. 

The new system, designated MSD85, works in conjunction with 
the High Precision Injection (HPI) system which is familiar from the 
N54 engine. 


Engine Control Module 

The high level of technology on the N63 engine place high 
demands on the DME system. The ECM used features a very 
powerful 150 MHz processor and features a new connector 
concept. 




The connector concept consists of five chambers and functional 
configuration. This means each chamber is assigned to a specific 
function group. 

The following list outlines the configuration of the chambers in 
corresponding order: 

• Chamber 1 (8 pins): Ignition 

• Chamber 2 (59 pins): Engine plug, cylinder bank 1 and 
several central engine functions 

• Chamber 3 (40 pins): Vehicle plug 

• Chamber 4 (54 pins): Engine plug, cylinder bank 2 and 
several central engine functions 

• Chamber 5(16 pins): Fuel injection 

An engine plug relates to sensor/actuator connections on the 
engine while the vehicle plug represents the interface to the 
vehicle specific components. 

The functions of the engine management system are described 
in the respective systems. 



























Sensors 


Oxygen Sensors 

The familiar Bosch LSF4.2 sensors are used as the monitor 
sensors downstream of the catalytic converter. 

The control sensors upstream of the catalytic converter are new. 
The new LSU ADV sensors are used here for the first time. 

LSU denotes oxygen sensor universal and ADV advanced. 

They therefore represent further-developed broadband oxygen 
sensors. 

The new ADV oxygen sensor has an extended measuring range: 

It starts measuring from Lambda = 0.65. Other advantages of the 
new sensor include the higher temperature stability, shorter 
response times of less than 30 milliseconds as well as high signal 
accuracy. 

The fact that the sensor is ready for operation in less than 5 
seconds means lower emission values in the engine warm-up 
phase. Thanks to higher measuring dynamics of the sensor, the 
air-fuel ratio can be more effectively determined and controlled 
separately for each cylinder. 

This results in a homogeneous exhaust flow that reduces emis¬ 
sions while also having a favorable effect on long-term emission 
characteristics. The service life of the sensor equals the service life 
of the vehicle.

Actuators 


56 

N63 Engine Workbook 


Electric Fan 

As usual, the electric fan has its own electronics module and is 
controlled dependent on engine speed by a pulse-width modulated 
signal. The pulse duty factor during normal operation (100 Hz) is 
converted into a speed signal. 

• 7% pulse duty factor wakes the fan electronics 

• 11 % pulse duty factor equates to 33% of the maximum 
fan speed 

• 93% pulse duty factor equates to the maximum fan speed 

• 97% pulse duty factor is a command for self-diagnosis of the 
fan electronics 

To output the fan after-running command, the output frequency of 
the DME is reduced to 10 Hz during the latching phase (terminal 
15 OFF). The fan time and speed are selected based on the pulse 
duty factor. 

A further new feature is that the DME switches the power supply 
through terminal 30 via a relay.

Air Management 


Air Intake and Exhaust System 

The main change to the air intake and exhaust system of the N63 
engine is the interchanged positions of the intake and exhaust 
sides. 

Consequently, the exhaust manifolds and turbochargers as well as 
the catalytic converters are located in the V-space of the engine. 

This arrangement makes the N63 engine very compact despite 
the turbocharging. Another new feature is indirect charge air 
cooling with intercoolers mounted on the engine.

Turbocharging 

The turbocharging principle of the N63 engine is very similar to that 
of the N54 engine. Two relatively small, parallel-connected exhaust 
turbochargers ensure rapid response already at low engine speeds. 

The boost pressure is controlled by means of wastegate valves. 
Diverter valves are also used.

Principle of Operation 

The turbocharger is driven by the engine's exhaust gasses, i.e. 
exhaust gasses under pressure are routed by the turbocharger 
turbine and in this way delivers the motive force to the compressor, 
which rotates on the same shaft. It is here that the induction air is 
precompressed in such a way that a higher air mass is admitted 
into the engine's combustion chamber. 

In this way, it is possible to inject and combust a greater quantity of 
fuel, which increases the engine's power output and torque. 

The turbine and the compressor can rotate at speeds of up to 
175,000 rpm. The exhaust inlet temperature can reach a maximum 
of 950°C. 

Because of these high temperatures, the turbochargers of the N63 
engine are not only connected with the engine oil system but also 
integrated in the engine coolant circuit. 

In connection with the auxiliary electric coolant pump on the N63 
engine, even after the engine has been switched off, it is possible 
to dissipate the residual heat from the turbochargers, thus prevent¬ 
ing the lubricating oil in the bearing housing from overheating. 

Bi-turbocharging 

Great importance is attached to turbocharger response in the N63 
engine. A delayed response to the driver's command, i.e. the 
accelerator-pedal position, is not acceptable. 

The driver therefore must not experience any so-called "turbo lag". 
This requirement is met in the N63 engine with two relatively small 
turbochargers, which are connected in parallel. Each cylinder bank 
drives one exhaust turbocharger. 

The advantage of smaller turbochargers lies in the fact that, as the 
turbocharger runs up to speed, the lower moment of inertia of the 
turbine causes fewer masses to be accelerated, thus allowing the 
compressor to attain a higher boost pressure in a shorter amount of 
time. 


Boost Pressure Control 

The boost pressure of the turbochargers is directly dependent on 
the flow of exhaust gas which reaches the turbocharger turbines. 
Both the velocity and the mass of the exhaust gas flow are directly 
dependent on engine speed and engine load. The engine manage¬ 
ment system uses wastegate valves to control the boost pressure. 

These valves are operated by vacuum units, which are controlled 
by electropneumatic pressure converters (EPDW) via the engine 
management system. 

The vacuum is generated by the permanently driven vacuum pump 
and stored in a pressure accumulator. The system is designed to 
ensure that these loads/consumers do not have a negative influ¬ 
ence on the brake boost function. 

The flow of exhaust gas to the turbine wheel can be influenced 
with the wastegate valves. When the boost pressure has reached 
its desired level, the wastegate valve begins to open and direct part 
of the exhaust-gas flow past the turbine wheel. 

This prevents the turbine from further increasing the speed of the 
compressor. This control option allows the system to respond to 
various operating situations. 

In the idle phase, the wastegate valves of both turbochargers are 
closed. This enables the full exhaust-gas flow available to be 
utilized to speed up the compressor already at these low engine 
speeds. When power is then demanded from the engine, the 
compressor can deliver the required boost pressure without any 
noticeable time lag. 

In the full-load situation, the boost pressure is maintained at a con¬ 
sistently high level when the maximum permissible torque is 
reached by a partial opening of the wastegate valves. In this way, 
the compressors are only ever induced to rotate at a speed which 
is called for by the operating situation.

Opening of the wastegate valves takes drive energy from, the 
turbine thus limiting the charger speed and preventing overspeed. 
In addition, there is no further increase in boost pressure, thus 
benefiting fuel consumption. 

At full-load the N63 engine operates at an overpressure of up to 
0.8 bar in the intake manifold. 

Blow-off Control 

The diverter valves in the N63 engine reduce unwanted peaks in 
boost pressure which can occur when the throttle valve closes 
quickly. 

They therefore have an important function with regard to engine 
acoustics and help to protect the turbocharger components.

Diverter valve, closed

Diverter valve, open 


A vacuum is generated in the intake manifold when the throttle 
valve is closed at high engine speeds. This leads to a build-up of 
high dynamic pressure after the compressor which cannot escape 
because the route to the intake manifold is blocked. 

This leads to a "pumping up" of the turbocharger. This means that 

• a clearly noticeable, disruptive pumping noise can be heard, 

• and this pumping noise is accompanied by a component¬ 
damaging load being exerted on the turbocharger, since high- 
frequency pressure waves exert axial load on the turbocharger 
bearings. 

The diverter valves are electrically operated valves. When the throt¬ 
tle valve closes, the boost pressure (upstream of the throttle valve) 
and its increase are compared with stored target values. 

The diverter valves are opened if the actual values exceed the tar¬ 
get by a certain value. As a result, the boost pressure is diverted to 
the intake side of the compressor. 

This procedure prevents the disruptive and component-damaging 
pumping effect from occurring. 





Diverter valve 


























Charge Air Cooling 

Indirect charge air cooling is used for the first time on the N63 
engine. The charge air is not routed directly to an air-to-air heat 
exchanger. 


The charge air is cooled by means of an air-to-coolant heat 
exchanger. The N63 engine therefore features a separate self 
contained low-temperature coolant circuit. 



Cooling the charge air serves to increase power output as well as 
reduce fuel consumption. The charge air heated in the turbocharg¬ 
er by its component temperature and by compression is cooled in 
the intercooler by up to 80°C. 

This increases the density of the charge air, which in turn improves 
the charge in the combustion chamber. This results in a lower level 
of required boost pressure. The risk of knock is also reduced and 
the engine operates with improved efficiency. 


Indirect charge air cooling has the advantage of requiring little 
space as the system can be mounted directly on the engine. 
Due to the near-engine installation position, the distinctly shorter 
pipe length required for charge air routing also have a positive 
effect. 


In this way, pressure loss has been substantially reduced, thus 
improving power yield and engine response.

Load Control 

Load control of the N63 engine is realized by means of the throttle 
valve and the wastegate valves. 

The throttle valve is the primary component in this process. 

The wastegate valves are actuated to bring about a fine tuning of 
the boost pressure. At full load the throttle valve is completely 
open and load control is undertaken by the wastegate valves. 

The load control graphic shows that the wastegate valves are 
integrated in load control in all operating situations of the N63 
engine on the basis of characteristic map control. 

Controlled Variables 

Among other things, the following variables influence boost 
pressure control in the N63 engine: 

• Intake-air temperature 

• Engine speed 

• Throttle-valve position 

• Ambient pressure 

• Intake-manifold pressure 

• Pressure before the throttle valve (reference variable) 

The electropneumatic pressure transducers are activated by the 
engine control unit on the basis of these variables. 

The result of this activation can be checked from the boost pres¬ 
sure achieved, which is measured before the throttle valve. 

There follows a comparison of the boost pressure achieved with 
the setpoint data from the characteristic map, which can, if 
necessary, give rise to an activation correction. 

The system therefore controls and monitors itself during operation.

Limp-home Mode 

In the event during operation of malfunctions, implausible values or 
failure of any of the sensors involved in turbocharger control, activa¬ 
tion of the wastegate valves is shut down and the valve flaps are 
thus fully opened. Turbocharging ceases at this point. 

The list below sets out those components or functional groups of 
the N63 engine in which a failure, a malfunction or implausible 
values result in boost pressure control being deactivated. 

The driver is alerted to a fault of this type by the emission warning 
lamp. 

• High pressure fuel system 

• Inlet VANOS 

• Exhaust VANOS 

• Crankshaft sensor 

• Camshaft sensor 

• Boost-pressure sensor 

• Knock sensors 

• Intake-air temperature sensor 

One principle of vehicle repair is particularly important in this 
respect: 

When diagnosing any fault, particularly with a turbocharged 
engine, it is important to focus on causes rather than the effects. 

With regard to the diagnosis and subsequent repair of turbocharg¬ 
ing components, it is important to ensure that they are also actually 
identified as defective components with the diagnostic technology 
available. It is always vital to ensure that the cause of the fault is 
determined and rectified and that if necessary work is not carried 
out on symptoms of fault consequences. 

Thus, for instance, a leaking flange on the intercooler can have far- 
reaching consequences. 


The N63 engine also is governed by three golden rules of 
procedure: 

1. It is important to not immediately blame the turbocharger for 
all power related complaints. Turbochargers are frequently 
mis-diagnosed and unnecessarily replaced. 

If blue smoke emerges from the exhaust system, check 
whether the air cleaner is contaminated or the engine is 
consuming too much oil because of wear. 

If the turbocharger is running too loud, inspect all the 
connections on the turbocharger pressure side. If black 
smoke or a loss of power is detected, in this case check the 
engine and the connecting pipes first. 

2. Main causes of turbocharger damage: 

• Insufficient lubrication and consequently bearing failure. 

• Foreign bodies damage the turbine and impeller. The result¬ 
ing imbalance will reduce efficiency and may cause rotor 
damage. 

• Contaminated lube oil causes scoring on shaft journals and 
bearings. Elements entering the turbocharger system from 
the out side such as sand, dirt, screws and the like will be 
trapped by a filter before the compressor. 

Service the filters at regular intervals (service intervals). 

3. Do not make any alterations to the turbocharger. 

Never attempt to tamper with or alter the boost-pressure 
control linkage. If the turbocharger operates at higher boost 
pressures than permitted by the engine manufacturer, the 
engine may run hot and pistons, cylinder heads or engine 
bearings may fail, or the safety function of the engine 
electronics may respond and activate the engine's 
limp-home program.

The admission pressure is monitored by the low pressure sensor. 
The fuel is delivered by the electric fuel pump in line with demand. 
If this sensor fails, the electric fuel pump continues to run at 100% 
delivery with terminal 15 ON. 

The fuel is compressed in the permanently driven single-piston 
high pressure pump and delivered through the high pressure line 
to the rail. 

The fuel accumulated under pressure in the rail in this way is dis¬ 
tributed via the high pressure lines to the piezo-injectors. 

The required fuel delivery pressure is determined by the engine- 
management system as a function of engine load and engine 
speed. The pressure level reached is recorded by the rail pressure 
sensor and communicated to the engine control unit. 

Control takes place by means of the volume control valve based 
on setpoint/actual value adjustment of the rail pressure. 

Configuration of the pressure is geared towards best possible 
consumption and smooth running of the N63 engine. 200 bar is 
required only at high load and low engine speed.

Design and function of high pressure pump 

The fuel is delivered via the supply passage at the admission pres¬

pump. 

From there, the fuel is directed via the volume control valve and the 
low pressure non-return valve into the fuel chamber of the plunger 
and-barrel assembly.

Electrical connection for the volume

The fuel is placed under pressure by a piston in this plunger-and- 
barrel assembly and delivered via the high pressure non-return 
valve to the high pressure port. The high pressure pump is bolted 
to the cylinder head and is driven by a three-point cam on the 
camshaft. 



This means the piston is permanently moved by the three-point 
cam as soon as the engine is running. Fuel therefore continues to 
be pressurized for as long as new fuel is supplied to the high pres¬ 
sure pump via the volume control valve. 

The volume control valve is activated by means of the engine man¬ 
agement connection and determines the delivered quantity of fuel. 

The pressure is controlled by the volume control valve opening and 
closing in the direction from the plunger and barrel assembly to the 
fuel inlet. 

The fuel drawn in by the piston is largely forced back into the pres¬ 
sure inlet when the volume control valve is opened. 

The maximum pressure in the high pressure area is limited to 245 
bar. If excessive pressure is encountered, the high pressure circuit 
is relieved by a pressure relief valve via the ports leading to the low 
pressure area.

67

N63 Engine Workbook 


This is possible without any problems because of the incompress¬ 
ibility of the fuel, i.e. the fuel does not change in volume in 
response to a change in pressure. 

The pressure peak created is compensated for by the liguid volume 
in the low pressure area. The egualization chamber is incorporated 
in the feed to the high pressure pump. It has the task of reducing 
the pressure peaks produced by piston movement in the low pres¬ 
sure system. 

When the piston generates pressure, fuel passes between the pis¬ 
ton and its guide. This is intentional for lubrication purposes. 

A higher pressure is produced at the rear of the piston as it moves 
downwards. This could give rise to the danger of fuel being forced 
through the seal of the piston out of the pump and into the engine 
oil system. The connection to the equalization chamber ensures 
that there is never a pressure higher than the fuel feed behind the 
piston. 

When opened, the volume control valve prevents pressure fluctua¬ 
tions being transmitted into the low pressure system as changes in 
volume before and after the piston are equalized. 

Hydraulics diagram of fuel system 

The volume control valve controls the fuel pressure in the rail. It is 
activated by the engine management system via a pulse-width 
modulated (PWM) signal. 

Depending on the activation signal, a restrictor cross-section of 
varying size is opened and the fuel-mass flow required for the 
respective load point is set.

Fuel Injectors 

The fuel injectors on the N63 are the 
familiar piezo-electric design carried 
over from the N54. 

The outward opening, piezo injectors 
are an integral part of the spray-guid¬ 
ed injection strategy used on the HPI 
injection system. 

This type of piezo-injector ensures 
that the injected fuel spray cone 
remains stable, even under the pre¬ 
vailing influences of pressure and 
temperature in the combustion 
chamber. 

This injector design permits injection pressures of up to 200 bar 
and extremely quick opening of the nozzle needle. In this way, it is 
possible to inject fuel into the combustion chamber under condi¬ 
tions released from the power cycles limited by the valve opening 
times. 



The piezo-injector is integrated together with the spark plug 
centrally between the inlet and exhaust valves in the cylinder head. 
This installation position prevents the cylinder walls or the piston 
crown from being wetted with injected fuel. 


A uniform formation of the homogeneous air/fuel mixture is 
obtained with the aid of the gas movement in the combustion 
chamber and a stable fuel spray cone. 

The gas movement is influenced on the one hand by the geometry 
of the intake passages and on the other hand by the shape of the 
piston crown. The injected fuel is swirled in the combustion 
chamber with the boost air until a homogeneous mixture is avail¬ 
able throughout the compression space at the point of ignition. 

Injector Adjustment 

As with the piezo injectors from the N54, the injector adjustment 
must be carried out when the injectors are replaced. 

When the injectors are manufactured, a multitude of measurement 
data is recorded at specific points in the factory. In this way, the 
tolerance ranges for injector-quantity adjustment are determined 
and specified in a six-digit number combination. 

Information on the lift performance of the injector is also added for 
injector voltage adjustment. Injector adjustment is required 
because of the individual voltage demand of each piezo-actuator. 

An allocation is made to a voltage demand category, which is 
included in the number combination on the injector. These data are 
transmitted to the control unit. 

During engine operation, these values are used to compensate for 
deviations in the metering and switching performance. 

When replacing an injector, it is absolutely essentially to carryout 
an injector adjustment.

Injection Strategy 

Injection of the fuel mass required for the operating situation can 
take place in up to three individual injections. Which option is used 
in the relevant operating situation is dependent on engine load and 
speed. 

Here the actual time resulting from the engine speed available for 
metering the fuel is an important framework quantity. 

The following graphic shows the fuel injection strategy for an 
engine at operating temperature. 

A special situation during the operation of any engine is the range 
in which a high load occurs at low engine speed, so-called "Low 
End Torque" operation. In this operating situation, the required fuel 
mass is metered to the engine in three individual injections. 

This results in a highly effective mixture formation which in the final 
analysis has the effect of both increasing power output and saving 
fuel.

Operating Mode: Catalytic-converter Heating 

In order to bring the catalytic converters up to operating tempera¬ 
ture as quickly as possible, the N63 engine has a catalytic convert¬ 
er heating mode for when the engine is started from cold. 

In this mode, combustion heat is intentionally introduced into the 
exhaust train and not used first and foremost to develop power 
output. The point of ignition is moved to 30° crankshaft angle after 
TDC. 

The main quantity of the required fuel is injected before TDC and 
mixed with the boost air. The piston is situated after TDC in its 
downward travel such that the air/fuel mixture is already expanding 
again, which reduces the ignitability of the mixture. 

In order to ignite the mixture reliably, a small residual quantity of fuel 
is injected 25° crankshaft angle after TDC and this guarantees an 
ignitable mixture at the spark plug. 

This small fuel quantity therefore provides for ignition of the resid¬ 
ual charge in the combustion chamber. This operating mode is set 
by the engine-management system after a maximum period of 60 
seconds from engine starting but is terminated if the catalytic 
converter response temperature is reached earlier. 

Injector control and adaptation 

The fuel mass required for the operating situation is injected by the 
piezo-injector into the combustion chamber. This mass can be 
influenced by three correcting variables: 

• the rail pressure 

• the injector opening time 

• and the injector opening lift 

The injector opening time and the injector opening lift are activated 
directly at the piezo injector. The opening time is controlled via the 
signal ti and the opening lift via the energy quantity in the activation 
of the piezo-injector. 























Injector adaptation 

The fuel masses and injection cycles determined from the 
load/speed map are included in a pilot-control program map. 

Here, while further framework parameters are taken into considera¬ 
tion, the energy quantities and injector opening times required to 
activate the injectors are determined. The N63 engine can be 
safely and reliably operated with these characteristic map values. 

For optimization of: 

• Emission values 

• Smooth running 

• Fuel consumption 

• Power output 

The controlled variables of energy quantities and injector opening 
times are continuously monitored. This occurs on a cylinder-selec¬ 
tive basis by way of lambda closed-loop control. 

The residual oxygen in the exhaust gas is measured in each case 
for cylinder bank 1 and cylinder bank 2. The new oxygen sensors 
permit allocation to the individual cylinders. 

This measurement result is compared with the values expected 
from the set correcting variables. The result of a deviation is that 
the injector opening signal is adapted. This adaptation is stored in 
the control unit and is therefore available for subsequent engine 
operation. 

However, these stored values are lost when the system is flashed 
and must be relearned. A further adaptation of the injector activa¬ 
tion takes place depending on time and use. This cylinder-selective 
adaptation involves a check of the residual oxygen content with a 
conclusion as to the cylinder causing the situation. 


To this end, it is necessary for part of the exhaust gas flow not to be 
swirled in the turbocharger. For this reason, the flap of the waste- 
gate valve must be fully opened, i.e. swung out of the exhaust-gas 
flow. This wastegate flap position extends beyond its normal 
opening position in engine operation. 

Based on the result of this cylinder-selective monitoring, the energy 
quantity is adapted if necessary to activate the injectors. 

Furthermore, the cylinder-selective adaptation includes if necessary 
an adaptation of the injector opening signal based on smooth 
running monitoring of the N63 engine. 

Overall adaptation of the injectors is limited to a 15% additional 
quantity. 

HPI Limp-home mode 

If a fault is diagnosed in the system, such as e.g. failure of the rail 
pressure sensor, the volume control valve is de-energized; the fuel 
then flows via a so-called bypass into the rail. 

In the event of HPI limp-home mode, turbocharging is deactivated 
by an opening of the wastegate valves. 

Causes of HPI limp-home mode may be: 

• Implausible rail pressure sensor values 

• Failure of volume control valve 

• Leakage in high pressure system 

• Failure of high pressure pump 

• Failure of rail pressure sensor

Fuel System Safety 


• Working on this fuel system is only permitted after the engine 
has cooled down. The coolant temperature must not exceed 
40°C. This must be observed without fail, otherwise there is a 
danger of fuel sprayback on account of the residual pressure 
in the high pressure system. 

• When working on the high pressure fuel system, take particu¬ 
lar care to ensure conditions of absolute cleanliness and 
follow the work sequences described in the repair instructions. 
Even the tiniest contaminants and damage to the screw con¬ 
nections on the high pressure lines can cause leaks. 

• When working on the fuel system of the N63 engine, it is 
important to ensure that the ignition coils are not fouled by 
fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is significantly 
reduced by heavy fuel contact. This can cause sparkover at 
the spark-plug head and cause misfires. 

• Before making modifications to the fuel system, remove the 
ignition coils without fail and protect the spark-plug slot 
against the ingress of fuel with a cloth. 

• Before refitting the piezo-injector, remove the ignition coils and 
ensure conditions of absolute cleanliness. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced.

Performance Controls 


Cooling System 


Due to the exhaust turbocharging system and the compact arrangement of the turbochargers in the V-space, the heat output of the N63 
engine is very high. Correspondingly, great significance is attached to the cooling system. In addition, an indirect charge air cooling 
system has been developed for the first time where the charge air is cooled by an air-to-coolant heat exchanger. There are two separate 
cooling circuits for engine and charge air cooling.

Engine Cooling 

The engine cooling system undertakes the classic task of carrying heat away from the engine and maintaining a defined operating 
temperature as constant as possible. As on the N54 engine, the two turbochargers are also cooled. 

The N63 engine features a conventional coolant pump that is driven by the belt drive. This pump cannot be used to continue cooling 
the turbochargers after the engine has been shut down.

Auxiliary coolant pump for turbocharger cooling 

The electric coolant pump on the N54 engine features an 
after-running function to carry away the heat build-up from the 
turbochargers after the engine has been shut down. 

For this function, the N63 engine is equipped with an additional 
electrically operated coolant pump with an output of 20 W. 

This pump is also used during engine operation to assist tur¬ 
bocharger cooling. 

The auxiliary electric coolant pump cuts in, taking the following 
factors into consideration: 

• Coolant temperature at engine outlet 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected fuel quantity 

The heat input into the engine is calculated based on the injected 
fuel quantity. This function is similar to the heat management 
function on 6-cylinder engines. 


The after-running period of the auxiliary electric coolant pump can 
extend up to 30 minutes. The electric fan also cuts in to improve 
the cooling effect. 

As in previous systems, the electric fan runs for a maximum of 
11 minutes, however, it now operates more frequently. 

System Protection 

As on the N54 engine, in the event of the coolant or engine oil 
being subject to excessive temperatures, certain functions in the 
vehicle are influenced in such a way that more energy is made 
available to the engine cooling system, i.e. temperature increasing 
loads are avoided.

Charge Air Cooling 

With the introduction of the N63 engine, indirect charge air cooling is used for the first time at BMW. Heat is taken from the charge air by 
means of an air-to-coolant heat exchanger. This heat is then given off via a coolant-to-air heat exchanger into the ambient air. For this 
purpose, the charge air cooling system has its own low temperature cooling circuit, which is independent of the engine cooling circuit.

Intercoolers 

The intercoolers are installed on the end faces of the cylinder 
heads. They operate in accordance with the counterflow principle 
and cool the charge air by up to 80°C. 

Electric Coolant Pump 

The coolant circuit for charge air coolant is operated with a 50 W 
pump. This pump does not run automatically when the engine is 
turned on. 

Pump actuation depends on the following values: 

• Outside temperature 

• Difference between charge air temperature and 
outside temperature 

Venting 

A separate venting routine is provided for the purpose of venting 
the low-temperature circuit of the charge air cooling system. 

This venting is initiated in the same way as for the cooling circuit on 
6-cylinder engines. 

The venting test module can be found in the “Service Functions” 
section of the diagnostic program.
