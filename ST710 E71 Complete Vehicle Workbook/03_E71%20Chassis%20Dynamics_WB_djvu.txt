Introduction 


In the E70, the BMW Group introduced a new generation of 
dynamic driving systems that have now been comprehensively 
developed and enhanced in theX6 (E71). The regulating strategy 
of the individual systems, consistently subdivided into longitudinal, 
lateral and vertical dynamics, forms the basis for the wide variety 
of driving dynamics functions. 

In the X6, the BMW Group has developed a complementary drive 
and dynamic driving system that enables a distinct increase in 
agility, stability and traction, as well as an increase in safety, with¬ 
out compromising dynamics or efficiency. 

The complete package in the X6 includes the dynamic driving 
systems: 

• Dynamic Drive 

• Vertical Dynamic Control 

• Adaptive Drive 

• Electronic Height Control 

• Dynamic Stability Control 

• Active Steering 

• xDrive 

• Dynamic Performance Control 

All these functions enable the highest degree of dynamic driving 
performance through intelligent interaction between the systems. 
The slogan "The Ultimate Driving Machine" is more than just an 
integrated policy behind the development of each BMW vehicle. 



In the E71, Dynamic Performance Control forms an integral part of 
the standard eguipment and complements xDrive and Dynamic 
Stability Control, serving as an additional module to increase 
active safety and enhance the brilliant driving dynamics. As an 
option, the E71 customer can also order BMW innovations in the 
field of dynamic driving systems, e.g. Active Steering. When com¬ 
bined and interlinked in the E71, these individual modules create 
superior driving dynamics for more intense and safer enjoyment of 
the Ultimate Driving Machine.

The diagram shows the control units and bus systems that are related for the dynamic 
driving systems. 

One of the differences between the E71 and the E70 is that a new control unit known 
as Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) has been introduced. This ICM coordinates 
longitudinal and lateral dynamic control functions, which include the familiar Active 
Steering and the new Function Dynamic Performance Control [with QMVH], The 
ICM-CAN has been introduced as a new bus system especially for the ICM system 
network. It connects the ICM, AL and QMVH control units.

This second diagram of the system overview focuses in particular on the new dynamic driving system, Dynamic Performance Control. 
With Dynamic Performance Control, a new system network will be introduced in the form of the Integrated Chassis Management. 
This will result in changes that affect the interaction of the dynamic driving systems. 

The Active Steering is particularly affected by this, which is why the two eguipment variants with/without Active Steering are both 
explained in the following pages.

An electronically controlled bypass valve (EVV) is fitted on all variants of the E71 in order to control the volumetric flow in the 
hydraulic circuit for the power steering. It is actuated by the ICM control unit. 

If Active Steering is not fitted, the ICM-CAN is routed directly from the ICM control unit to the QMVH control unit.

The topology of the ICM-CAN bus system differs greatly between the two variants with/without Active Steering. If Active Steering is fitted,

to the QMVH control unit.

System Components 


Rear Differential with Superimposing Gear Units 

For Dynamic Performance Control, a rear differential is used that 
essentially consists of a conventional rear differential, supplement¬ 
ed by superimposing gear units on the left and right. 

The only difference is the welded connection of the ring gear and 
pinion gear (previously bolted). 

The two superimposing gear units are practically identical in 
terms of their structure, but differ slightly in terms of their detail. 
For example, the electric motors and planetary trains on the left or 
the right are different. 

This rear differential also has three oil reservoirs, subdivided in a 
similar way to in the picture, which are vented by a common duct.

Explanation

B

C 

Superimposing gear unit, right 



















There are therefore three filler plugs and three drain plugs on this 
rear differential. 

In the center part (angle drive with differential gear), the standard oil 
(hypoid oil) is used and, in the left and right superimposing gear 
units, a special ATF is used. 

Longlife oils are provided as standard in the rear differential with 
superimposing gear units. There are some exceptions dependent 
on the service life/use of the unit. 

All three reservoirs have a common vent on the top of the transmis¬ 
sion case. 

Note: The angle when the rear differential unit is removed 
and reinstalled must be no more than 45°. This could 
potentially cause the two types of oil to cross con¬ 
taminate through the common vent.

Construction of the Superimposing Gear Units 

The two superimposing gear units essentially consist of an actua¬ 
tor (electric motor), transmission gearing, a ball ramp, a multi-plate 
clutch and a planetary gear set. In contrast to standard planetary 
gear sets, this one does not contain a ring gear.

Multi-plate Clutch and Ball Ramp 

The multi-plate clutch and the ball ramp are designed in such a 
way that they are always de-energized if there is fault in the electric 
motor. In this event, the pressure spring assemblies now take on 
an important role between the ball ramp and the support plates. 

The pressure spring assemblies open the multi-plate clutch via the 
ball ramp and the freely rotating electric motor and hold it fully 
open. This ensures, among other things, that the loss oftorgue 
distribution is established in the event of a fault.

Electric Motors Left electric motor 

These are three-phase asynchronous motors. 

The three-phase voltage is generated by the QMVH control unit. 

This creates a rotating electromagnetic field around the metallic 
rotor which generates torque in the rotor. 

An asynchronous-motor design was selected because it guaran¬ 
tees a high level of power with a simple construction. 

Furthermore, the shaft of an asynchronous motor can be moved 
freely when the phase voltage is switched off. This is an integral 
part of the safety concept, because the phase voltage is switched 
off in the event of a fault. 


The left and right electric motors have different constructions. The 
phase voltage and temperature sensor connectors (2) are also 
coded differently. This will prevent the two motors from being 
mixed up or incorrectly connected. 

The two electric motors are connected to the superimposing gear 
units via the screw connections for the motor mounting (4). The 
electric motors thus have contact with the oil supply for the super¬ 
imposing gear units. 

Because the bearing (6) is not sealed, not only the pinion but also 
the entire rotor for the electric motor rotate in the oil. For this rea¬ 
son, the following housing seals are fitted to the electric motors: 

• Sealing ring (5) 

• Sealing ring at the join with the motor position sensor (not 
shown) 

• Seal at the connector for the phase voltage and temperature 
sensor (2), see the Sensor system section.

Sensor System 

The following sensors, integrated in the Dynamic Performance 
Control components, are therefore an integral part of the system. 

• Temperature sensors for the electric motors. 

• Temperature sensors for the superimposing gear unit 
transmission oil. 

• Motor position sensors. 

There is one of the sensors mentioned above for each superim¬ 
posing gear unit and each electric motor. 

Motor Position Sensor 

The motor position sensor is located on the rear of the electric 
motor (the side opposite the pinion). The sensor is identical to the 
one used for the Active Steering actuating motor. The sensor thus 
works according to the magnetoresistive principle and transmits 
the data digitally to the QMVH control unit via a two-wire line. 


Oil Temperature Sensors 

The two sensors for determining the temperature of the transmis¬ 
sion oil in the two superimposing gear units are arranged symmet¬ 
rically on the two sides.

Electric Motor Temperature Sensor 

The temperature sensor for the electric motor is located in the 
immediate vicinity of the connector through which the electric 
motor is supplied with the phase voltage. 

The temperature sensor for the electric motor (1) is a temperature- 
dependent resistor. The QMVH control unit measures the resist¬ 
ance and thus determines the temperature that is present in the 
electric motor. In the diagram, you can see the sealant (2) that was 
mentioned earlier which seals the housing to the connector. This 
prevents oil from escaping at this location. At the same time, the 
sealant performs the task of a heat conductor, so that the tempera¬ 
ture sensor is exposed to practically the same temperature as the 
rest of the components of the electric motor.

Mechanical Interfaces 

The rear differential with superimposing gear units for Dynamic 
Performance Control is bolted onto the rear axle carrier in the same 
way as the conventional rear differential. 

The propeller shaft is fixed to the rear differential with a double nut 
as on the E70. 

The output shafts are fitted in different ways on the E71 and E70. 

On the E70, the output shafts are inserted in the rear differential. 

On the E71, the actual output shafts are bolted to the output shaft 
flange. 

The heat conduction and protective plate (5) shown in the diagram 
has the following tasks: 

• Protects the connectors on the electric motors from stone 
impact. 

• Diverts heat from the exhaust system so that it does not heat 
up the rear differential too much.

Bus Systems 

The dynamic driving systems communicate via the usual bus sys¬ 
tems, such as the Powertrain CAN (PT-CAN) and the Chassis CAN 
(F-CAN). 

The F-CAN still performs the function of transmitting pure sensor 
signals. The signals from the DSC sensor and the steering wheel 
sensor in the steering column switch cluster have top priority. 
Despite the fact that the PT-CAN and F-CAN work at a high bit rate 
of 500 kbps, they would have been overloaded by the signals from 
the new ICM and QIVMH control units. For this reason, a new sub¬ 
bus, the ICM-CAN, has been introduced. 

The ICM-CAN is a sub-bus for the dynamic driving systems and 
connects the ICM, AL and QMVH control units. It is a two-wire bus 
on which data is transmitted at 500 kbps. The two terminating 
resistors, each with 120 Q, are located in the ICM and QMVH con¬ 
trol units. 

The ICM-CAN cabling in the vehicle varies considerably between 
the two variants with/without Active Steering. 

If Active Steering is fitted, the ICM-CAN is routed from the ICM 
control unit to the AL control unit. The ICM-CAN is picked up in 
the AL control unit and forwarded to the QMVH control unit. 

If Active Steering is not fitted, the ICM-CAN line is routed directly 
from the ICM control unit to the QMVH control unit. 

These control units use the ICM-CAN to exchange setpoint values 
and actual values, as well as status signals. These signals are only 
reguired locally for implementing the Dynamic Performance Control 
and Active Steering functions. 

In contrast, signals that the dynamic driving systems exchange with 
other control units are still transmitted via the PT-CAN. The PT- 
CAN is also the bus system via which the ICM, AL and QMVH con¬ 
trol units communicate with the diagnostic system. 


The ICM control unit does not therefore perform the function of a 
diagnostics gateway.

QMVH Control Unit 

Design 

The QMVH control unit is fitted at the rear right of the luggage 
compartment. 

As you can see from the following diagram, it is a dual-processor 
control unit. Power semiconductors are also integrated in the con¬ 
trol unit which function as output stages. 

Each processor is responsible for controlling one of the electric 
motors. In addition, each processor monitors the computed results 
of the other in order to meet the high safety requirements. The out¬ 
put stages can be separated before a fault has any critical effects. 

The output stages are used to generate the phase voltages and 
transport the energy required to control the electric motors. 

Because the electric motors are three-phase asynchronous 
motors, the three phases must be operated with alternating volt¬ 
age. The phases are generated by high-frequency pulsing of the 
DC voltage present in the vehicle electrical system. 

The high-frequency pulsing creates the risk that electromagnetic 
interference will be emitted. This would have a detrimental effect 
on radio reception, because the associated aerials are located near 
to the installation location of the QMVH control unit.

For this reason, the lines along which the electric motor phases are 
actuated are shielded. The ground connection is located on the 
connector for the QMVH control unit. 


There is also an ground connection from the wiring harness to the 
rear axle carrier. 

















The two outer pin sockets (3) and (6) are used to connect the 
wiring harnesses that lead to the superimposing gear units. 

Pin socket (4) connects the control unit to the vehicle electrical 
system: the supply voltage, PT-CAN and ICM-CAN are connected 
here. 

Pin socket (5) is not assigned and remains unused. 

Operation 

The QMVH control unit receives a request from the ICM control 
unit to transfer a certain amount of torque to the left or right rear 
drive wheel. The control unit must convert this setpoint value into 
phase voltages for the electric motor to be actuated. The following 
calculation steps are required for this: 

• Deciding which superimposing gear unit needs to be activat¬ 
ed. The side that should receive more of the available torque 
must be activated. 

• Converting the torque to be transferred into a braking force at 
the superimposing gear unit. 

• Determining the necessary adjustment path of the plates from 
the braking force that the plate assembly must generate. 

• Calculating the motor rotation angle to achieve the required 
adjustment path of the plates. 

• Determining the amplitude and progression of the three phase 
voltages. 

During the adjustment process, the QMVH control unit uses the 
motor position sensor to measure whether and how far the electric 
motor has already moved. Once the calculated specified angle is 
reached, the actuation is changed so that the rotational angle 
achieved is maintained. A motor position regulation therefore takes 
place. The regulation principle is similar to that for Active Steering. 


The QMVH control unit also carries out monitoring functions. This 
allows faults in the electronics and in the actuating elements to be 
detected which cause the function to be deactivated. In the event 
of a fault, the lines to the electric motors are disconnected. They 
are then de-energized and can no longer execute undesirable 
adjustment processes. 

The multi-plate clutches also open, so that a previously active 
torque transfer is withdrawn. 

The rear differential (and therefore the entire system) thus behaves 
like a conventional differential in the event of a fault. 

As well as detecting faults, the QMVH control unit also monitors 
the signals from the temperature sensors on the rear differential. 

A protective function is thus implemented, which reduces the actu¬ 
ating element controls if the temperature is too high. This is intend¬ 
ed to counteract any further heating (see also the Functions sec¬ 
tion). Both the temperatures in the electric motors and the temper¬ 
atures of the transmission oils in the two superimposing gear units 
are taken into consideration.

ICM Control Unit 


Installation location of the ICM control unit 


The ICM control unit is installed on the transmission tunnel (6). 

The lower section of the housing is bolted to the bodywork using 
spacer sleeves (5). The upper section of the housing has a ribbed 
structure for better heat dissipation. The ICM control unit has only 
one pin socket, which is used to make contact with the supply 
voltage, the bus systems and the control lines. 

The ICM control unit only contains output stages for the steering 
proportional valve (EVV - electronically controlled bypass valve) and 
the Servotronic valve. 

The ICM control unit is connected to three bus systems: the 
PT-CAN, the F-CAN and the new ICM-CAN. 

The ICM control unit makes calculations that have a decisive influ¬ 
ence on the vehicle behavior. This results in both high safety 
reguirements and a need for a large calculating capacity. For these 
two reasons, the ICM control unit is equipped with two processors.

Active Steering 

Virtually all of the components of Active Steering in the E71 are 
identical to those in the E70. To be precise, 

• the electric motor with motor position sensor, 

• the proportional valve (electronically controlled bypass valve, 
EVV) and 

• the Servotronic valve are identical in the two vehicle models. 
The AL control unit has a different construction in the E71 
and is only designed as an actuating control unit. 

Active Steering Control Unit 

The AL control unit is located at the front left in the A-pillar exten¬ 
sion under the wheel arch trim. 

It is a dual-processor control unit. Power semiconductors are also 
integrated in the control unit which function as output stages. The 
dual-processor concept was selected in order to meet the high 
safety requirements. 

The output stages (2), consisting of power semiconductors, are 
used to generate the phase voltages and transport the energy 
required to control the actuating motor. 

Because this is a three-phase synchronous motor, the three phas¬ 
es must be operated with alternating voltage. 

The phases are generated by high-frequency pulsing of the DC 
voltage present in the vehicle electrical system. For this reason, 
shielding is also used here. The shielding connects the electric 
motor to ground via the wiring harness to the body work. 

Connector (3) accommodates signal lines between the control unit 
and actuating element for Active Steering. These are the control 
lines to the solenoid lock and the signal lines for the motor position 
sensor. 


Load is supplied to Active Steering via the connector (4). This DC 
voltage is converted into the phase voltages by the output stages in 
the control unit and sent to the electric motor at connector (5). 

Connector (6) contains the contacts via which the control unit is 
supplied with power and those for connecting the two bus sys¬ 
tems, PT-CAN and ICM-CAN.

ARS 

At SOP for the E71 in April 2008, certain alterations will also be 
made simultaneously in the E70. 

Key modifications to the ARS: 

• Discontinuation of the additional ARS lateral acceleration 
sensor 

• Discontinuation of the two pressure-relief valves on the front 
axle oscillating motor 

• Discontinuation of the two exterior pulsation dampers on the 
front axle oscillating motor. 

Control Unit 

The ARS control unit is located in the vehicle interior near the right- 
hand A-pillar. 

The ARS control unit is supplied with power via terminal 30 and is 
protected by a 10 A fuse. The ARS control unit is activated exclu¬ 
sively by the Car Access System (CAS) on a CAN wake-up line 
after "ignition ON". 

A vehicle authentication process takes place when the system is 
started. This compares the vehicle identification number from CAS 
with the vehicle identification number which is encoded in the ARS 
control unit. 

Then the ARS control unit's hardware and software are checked. 

All outputs (valve solenoids and sensors) are subjected to a com¬ 
prehensive check for short circuits and circuit breaks. If there is a 
fault, the system switches the actuators to a safe driving mode. 

The ARS control unit switches off if there is undervoltage or over¬ 
voltage. 

The ARS control unit learns the offset for the steering angle and 
the lateral acceleration during start-up and during driving. 


Active Anti-roll Bar 

The oscillating motor and the oscillating motor housing are joined 
by one half of the anti-roll bar. 

The active anti-roll bar consists of the oscillating motor and the 
anti-roll bar halves fitted to the oscillating motor, with press-fitted 
roller bearings for their connection to the axle carriers. The use of 
roller bearings ensures optimum comfort thanks to better response 
and reduced control forces. 

A thin coating of grease on the roller bearing does not impair the 
function of the active anti-roll bar. 

Similarly, a totally new inner pulsation damping system is intro¬ 
duced, which is integrated into the construction of the oscillating 
motor shaft. This eliminates the need for the two pressure relief 
valves on the front motor.

duced from 10/07, this dynamic emergency brake and parking 
brake is complemented by the automatic hold function which func¬ 
tions the same as on the E65/E66.

Principles of Operation 


Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) 

A new feature in the E71 is the continuation of the concept of a 
higher-level dynamic driving control with Integrated Chassis 
Management. 

The introduction of the ICM control unit is rather secondary. Of 
more significance, is the fact that all the dynamic driving systems 
in the vehicle can be coordinated in a more harmonized way using 
the ICM. 

The previous approach of using one control unit for each main 
direction of movement has not been applied in the E71. Instead, 
the ICM control unit coordinates both longitudinal and lateral 
dynamic processes. In concrete terms, this means that Active 
Steering and the new Dynamic Performance Control function are 
controlled by the ICM. 

However, this does not mean that the ICM has exclusive decision¬ 
making powers over the type and degree of the intervention of all 
the dynamic driving systems. One reason for this is that the DSC 
and xDrive systems used in the E70 are to be largely adopted in 
the E71. The E71 therefore shares the following similarities with 
the E70: 

• If the vehicle needs to be restabilized when it is in its limit 
range, the DSC calculates the need for the brakes to be 
applied and applies them. This is also the case in the E71 
despite the coordination function of the ICM. 

• The DSC calculates the longitudinal distribution of the drive 
torque for xDrive and transmits the setpoint value to the 
transfer case control unit. There, the drive torque is distrib¬ 
uted between the front and rear axles through activation of 
the multi-plate clutch. 


The DSC therefore remains the determining control unit in the 
E71 when it comes to stabilizing the vehicle's behavior in the limit 
range. In this case, the DSC sends commands to the ICM to 
cease control by Dynamic Performance Control. However, while 
the vehicle is stable, the ICM has full decision making authority 
over the activation of Dynamic Performance Control. 

The Active Steering functions (in particular the yaw-rate control) 
are not affected by this withdrawal of control. They continue to be 
implemented even if the vehicle's behavior is unstable, because 
they help to stabilize it. 

The Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM) is still responsible for 
controlling the vertical dynamics. Signals regarding the current 
driving situation are naturally exchanged between the ICM and 
VDM. 


E71 Chassis Dynamics Workbook

E71 Chassis Dynamics Workbook 


Monitoring the Vehicle Status 

The Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) control unit calculates 
the current driving situation from the signals listed below. This 
refers only to the longitudinal and lateral dynamic driving status. 

• Wheel speed signals from all four wheels 

• Longitudinal acceleration 

• Lateral acceleration 

• Yaw rate 

The ICM control unit thus knows how the vehicle is actually moving 
at that moment. 

To be able to optimize the vehicle behavior, the dynamic driving 
systems reguire information about how the driver wishes the vehi¬ 
cle to move. The driver's command is determined from the follow¬ 
ing signals: 

• Accelerator pedal angle, current engine torgue and gear ratio 

• Application of the brake pedal and current brake pressure 

• Steering angle 

The ICM control compares the driver's command and the current 
actual movement of the vehicle and calculates whether intervention 
from the Active Steering and Dynamic Performance Control sys¬ 
tems is necessary and what form this should take. 

Coordinated Intervention by the Dynamic Driving Systems 

Intervention by dynamic driving systems that operate in the longitu¬ 
dinal and lateral directions have the following objectives: 

• To optimize the rotational motion of the vehicle about the ver¬ 
tical axis by effecting a yaw moment. This will increase the sta¬ 
bility and/or the agility, depending on the driving situation. 

• To improve the traction of the vehicle. 


The Integrated Chassis Management allows these objectives to be 
achieved to a greater extent. The ICM acts as a coordinator and 
distributes the tasks to one or more systems. 

To date, the following options have been available (and continue to 
be) for intervention to achieve the objectives stated above. The cor¬ 
responding dynamic driving systems are indicated in brackets: 

• Individual application of the wheel brakes (ASC+T, DSC) 

• Adjustment of the current engine torgue (ASC+T, DSC, MSR) 

• Distribution of the drive torgue between the rear and front 
axles (xDrive) 

• Adjustment of the steering angle of the front wheels, regard¬ 
less of the driver's input (Active Steering). 

In the E71, a further option for improving the traction and optimiz¬ 
ing the rotational motion is available for the first time. The Dynamic 
Performance Control allows the drive torgue to be distributed in a 
controlled way between the driven rear wheels. 

The coordinated interventions by the systems with the help of the 
Integrated Chassis Management bring about several advantages. 

In some driving situations, it can prevent more than one system 
providing the same intervention. 

For example, systems such as Dynamic Performance Control act 
as an enhancement to xDrive before the unstable driving situation 
even occurs. This happens without the driver being aware of it and 
avoids further intervention by Active Steering or Dynamic Stability 
Control. 


Active Steering in the ICM Network 

The functions of Active Steering that are perceptible to the cus¬ 
tomer in the E71 are identical to those in the E70. Active Steering 
also provides: 

• a variable steering-transmission ratio that changes according 
to the vehicle's road speed and 

• Yaw-Rate Control Plus (GRR+), which is used to stabilize 
steering interventions, not only when the vehicle is oversteer¬ 
ing, but also when it is being braked on surfaces with various 
friction coefficients. 

Just some of the parameters have been specifically adapted for the 
new E71 vehicle type. 

The distribution of the functions between the control units and 
thus their interaction have changed. This is due to the new ICM 
control unit network in the E71. 

The Integrated Chassis Management is the control unit in which 
the higher-level dynamic driving functions for Active Steering are 
calculated. As already described, the current driving situation is 
analyzed. The input variables for this are provided by: 

• the steering column switch cluster (steering angle and steer¬ 
ing-angle speed), 

• the DSC sensor (yaw rate, lateral acceleration and longitudinal 
acceleration) and 

• Dynamic Stability Control (wheel speeds) In addition, the dri¬ 
ver's directional input is analyzed using the steering angle and 
the steering-angle speed (both signals from the steering col¬ 
umn switch cluster).

E71 Chassis Dynamics Workbook 


The Integrated Chassis Management uses the current driving situ¬ 
ation and the driver's directional input to calculate the individual 
setpoint values for the variable steering transmission ratio and the 
Yaw-Rate Control Plus. Once these have been prioritized, the ICM 
provides a resulting setpoint value. This is a specified angle to 
which the front wheels should be adjusted. 

The Active Steering control unit receives this setpoint value and 
has the principal task of controlling the actuating elements such 
that the setpoint value is achieved. The Active Steering control unit 
is therefore purely an actuating control unit. This is the main differ¬ 
ence from the previous implementation of Active Steering. There, 
the control unit not only controlled the actuators, but also calculat¬ 
ed the higher-level regulating functions. 

In order to ensure that the setpoint value is applied, Active Steering 
control unit reads the signal from the motor-position sensor. This 
additional steering angle for Active Steering is also communicated 
to the ICM control unit and then to the DSC control unit. 

To remain consistent with the E70, the DSC control unit in the E71 
also calculates the cumulative steering angle from the steering 
angle and the Active Steering steering angle. 

The DSC control unit provides the cumulative steering angle to the 
other control units via the PT-CAN. 

All variants of the E71 eguipped with Active Steering automatically 
receive the Servotronic function. This function is controlled by the 
ICM control unit. 

All variants of the E71 steering system also contains a proportional 
valve that is also controlled by the ICM control unit. The valve is 
known as an electronically controlled bypass valve (EVV). 

The volumetric flow generated by the power steering pump is dis¬ 
tributed between the steering valve and a bypass valve according 
to the level of power steering assistance reguired. This distribution 
is infinitely variable. 


The less power steering assistance reguired, the more hydraulic 
fluid is diverted to the bypass circuit. Because the hydraulic fluid in 
the bypass circuit has no task to perform, it means that the power 
steering pump consumes less power. In this way, the proportional 
valve has a hand in reducing fuel consumption and C02 emissions. 

ICM Interfaces 

The ICM control unit has two further interfaces with partner control 
units for the Active Steering function. These are: 

• Instrument cluster 

• Engine control system 

Instrument Cluster 

If the ICM control unit detects a fault in the Active Steering system 
(faulty input signal, faults in the control unit or in the Active Steering 
actuator), it activates the usual steering warning lamp and the asso¬ 
ciated Check Control message. This reguest is implemented by 
the instrument cluster. 

Engine Control Module 

If there is a high level of steering activity, in particular at low road 
speeds, the cooling reguirement in the hydraulic system increases. 

To prevent overheating, the ICM control unit can ask for the speed 
of the electric fan to be increased. This reguest is sent via the PT- 
CAN to the engine control system, because the latter directly con¬ 
trols the electric fan.

Longitudinal distribution of the drive torque byxDrive 


Distribution of the Drive Torque (xDrive w/o DPC) 

The BMW xDrive all-wheel-drive system regulates the variable dis¬ 
tribution of the drive torque between the front and rear axles, result¬ 
ing in a longitudinal distribution of the drive torque. In the current 
xDrive generation, the distribution is performed by an adjustable 
multi-plate clutch. xDrive helps to improve the traction and stability 
of the vehicle. 

In the situation shown, the distribution of the drive torque byxDrive 
is the standard distribution. 40% is distributed to the front axle and 
60% to the rear axle. 

The front and rear axle transmissions distribute the drive torque 
equally to both sides. In terms of driving force, 20% is available at 
each front wheel and 30% at each rear wheel. 

This distribution is appropriate for driving in a straight line. 

Because the drive torque is equal at the left and right wheels, any 
differing friction coefficients on the left and right are not initially 
factored in (of course, ASC+T will intervene if one or more wheels 
are threatening to spin as a result).

Distribution of the Drive Torque (xDrive w/ DPC) 

Dynamic Performance Control now also enables infinitely variable 
distribution of the drive torque between the wheels on the rear axle. 
Instead of a longitudinal distribution, as provided by xDrive, 

Dynamic Performance Control provides a lateral distribution of the 
drive torque. That is why, in technical documentation, the term "rear 
axle lateral torque distribution" often appears as a synonym for the 
sales designation "Dynamic Performance Control". 

A new rear differential developed on the basis of a conventional dif¬ 
ferential allows the torque flow to and from the wheels to be con¬ 
trolled. 

This means that not only can stability and traction be further 
increased, but the vehicle's agility can also be improved. 

The combination of the xDrive and Dynamic Performance Control 
systems is able to further improve the vehicle behavior under accel¬ 
eration and on surfaces with different friction coefficients on the left 
and right. Lets assume that the right rear wheel is on dry asphalt 
and the left rear wheel is on snow. In addition to the longitudinal 
distribution of the drive torque by xDrive, Dynamic Performance 
Control allows the drive torque to be distributed between the rear 
wheels. In this situation, the majority of the drive torque will be 
transmitted to the right rear wheel, because the left rear wheel can 
only generate relatively little driving force due to the low friction 
coefficient. This can avoid ASC+T having to intervene by applying 
the brakes. 

The uneven distribution of the torque at the rear wheels has a sec¬ 
ond effect that is also used by Dynamic Performance Control. 

Torque (M) is generated about the vertical axis of the vehicle. This 
means that the rotational motion of the vehicle about the vertical 
axis when cornering can be intentionally influenced. You can use 
this effect to turn the vehicle harder into a corner or to dampen the 
rotational movement.

Fixed Distribution of the Drive Torque 
with Conventional Rear Differential 

A conventional rear differential consists of an angle drive and a dif¬ 
ferential gear and always distributes the drive torgue egually (50:50) 
to both sides. Different rotational speeds are balanced out. 

The different gear ratios for the various vehicle models are achieved 
by the different number of teeth on the drive pinion and crown gear. 

Distribution of the Drive Torque by the Rear Differential 
with Mechanical Locks (limited-slip differential) 

A open/conventional differential has two beneficial features: 


Variable Distribution of the Drive Torque in the Rear 
Differential with Superimposing Gear Units 

The new rear differential with superimposing gear units abolishes 
this fixed torgue distribution by the differential gear. The differential 
gear is supplemented by a superimposing gear unit on each side. 
These provide a second additional path along which the drive 
torgue can be transmitted. 

In all three load situations: 

• traction, 

• coasting and 


• The speed of the drive wheels can differ from each other 
because of the different distances they cover when cornering. 

• The drive torgue is always distributed egually to both drive 
wheels and does not therefore generate any yawing. 

These benefits are counterbalanced by a major disadvantage if the 
tire-road adhesion is different at the two wheels. The propelling 
forces that are to be transferred to the road are then limited to the 
lower of the two potential adhesion levels at the drive wheels. 

If the adhesion ratio is unfavorable on one side, it means that a 
vehicle (without electronic dynamic driving system) would not be 
able to move off. The drive torgue would be converted into useless 
rotational acceleration for the wheel with the lower potential adhe¬ 
sion level, while the higher potential adhesion of the second drive 
wheel remains unexploited. 

Selectable and self-locking rear differentials are fitted in order to 
eliminate this disadvantage of the differential gear. 


• overrun 

the BMW Dynamic Performance Control system allows the torgue 
to be ideally distributed between the two rear wheels. 


A - Torque Transfer Under Traction 

The traction load situation means that the engine is generating 
a positive drive torgue. In this respect, the functions of the BMW 
Dynamic Performance Control hardly differ from those of the com¬ 
petition. The BMW system can transfer up to 1,800 Nm of drive 
torgue from one wheel to the other.

The competitive advantage of the BMW system becomes clear in 
other load situations. 

B - Torque Transfer During Coasting 

During coasting, there is no drive torque (0 Nm). 

When there is power being transmitted between the engine and 
transmission, this occurs when the engine torque is exactly equal 
to the loss torques. It also occurs if the driver disconnects the 
power transmission between the engine and the gearbox (selector 
lever in the neutral position). 

There is then zero torque at the input to the rear differential. In con¬ 
trast to the competitors' systems, Dynamic Performance Control 
can also bring about torque transfer in this load situation. If a wheel 
is to receive positive torque, an equal amount of negative torque 
will occur at the other wheel.

C - Overrunning: Negative Torque in the Propeller Shaft 

If the engine is delivering negative torque, e.g. during overrun fuel 
cut-off, this is known as overrunning. Even in this case, Dynamic 
Performance Control allows torque transfer, i.e. a negative torque 
can also be distributed asymmetrically to the two wheels. The 
torque transfer can even be increased to such an extent that there 
is an extremely large negative torque at one wheel and a slight pos¬ 
itive torque at the other wheel.

Improved Traction 

Accelerating Out of Corners 

Dynamic Performance Control enables improved cornering traction 
by adapting the torque distribution to the potential adhesion 
between each tire and the road. 

The vehicle can be accelerated out of the corner more quickly 
without impairing directional stability. 

The rolling motion of the vehicle when cornering generates differ¬ 
ent wheel contact forces. The contact forces at the wheels on the 
outside of the corner are greater than those at the wheels on the 
inside of the corner. 


- xDrive 

In this situation, the xDrive system distributes the drive torque 
equally to the front and rear axles. The front and rear axle transmis¬ 
sions transfer the drive torque evenly to the left and right sides. 

The front and rear wheels on the left-hand side cannot, however, 
transfer any driving force to the icy road. ASC+T applies the brakes 
to the left wheels, converting their proportion of the drive torque 
into heat. The entire proportion of the drive torque transferred to 
the wheels on the right-hand side (25% each) is available for accel¬ 
eration. 

In effect, then, 50% of all the torque generated for pulling 
away is efficiently utilized. 


Therefore, the maximum forces that can be transferred to the road 
are greater at the wheels on the outside of the corner than at the 
wheels on the inside of the corner. Dynamic Performance Control 
has an ingenious way of using this effect. If the driver accelerates 
while cornering, more drive torque is distributed to the rear wheel 
on the outside of the corner than to the rear wheel on the inside of 
the corner. In this way, the adhesion potential of the rear wheels is 
better exploited. Overall, the vehicle can make use of a greater drive 
torque to accelerate in the corner. 

Driving off on Surfaces with Varying Friction Coefficients 

The improved traction when pulling away will be particularly notice¬ 
able to the driver when the road surface has various friction coeffi¬ 
cients. This mixture of friction coefficients makes the variable distri¬ 
bution of the drive torque between the individual wheels more evi¬ 
dent. 

Dynamic Performance Control distributes the drive torque to the 
side where more power can be transferred. 

Lets look at a situation where the vehicle is pulling away with differ¬ 
ent friction coefficients on the left and right sides to compare the 
basic principles for torque distribution in xDrive and Dynamic 
Performance Control.

- xDrive with DPC 

The combination of the two systems, xDrive and Dynamic 
Performance Control, further improves the already good pulling 
away performance on surfaces with various friction coefficients. 
Dynamic Performance Control detects that the left rear wheel is 
threatening to spin using the wheel speed signals (in a similar 
way to ASC+T). Instead of ASC+T reducing the drive torgue by 
applying the brakes, Dynamic Performance Control diverts virtually 
all of the drive torgue at the rear axle to the right rear wheel. 

Because a QMVH differential is only used on the rear axle, the 
torgue distribution at the front wheels remains unaffected. ASC+T 
still needs to apply the brakes here to prevent the left front wheel 
from spinning. 

There is now a total of 75% of the drive torque available for 
pulling away (50% at the right rear wheel, plus 25%at the 
right front wheel). 

Particularly on surfaces with various friction coefficients, a vehicle 
with Dynamic Performance Control will have more tractive force at 
its disposal and will thus be able to accelerate harder than a vehicle 
that is only eguipped with xDrive. By laterally distributing the drive 
torgue, Dynamic Performance Control therefore improves traction 
when pulling away.

Increased Agility 

The intelligent interaction between the mechatronic systems, DSC 
and xDrive, guarantees excellent traction and stability. 

However, there is a certain conflict of objectives, which generates 
more stability at the expense of agility. 

Dynamic Performance Control, which is also a mechatronic system, 
is a logical enhancement to DSC and xDrive, because it can pro¬ 
vide an infinitely variable distribution of the drive torgue between 
the left and right wheels on the rear axle. This is pretty much 
regardless of how much input torgue there is. 

The conflict between stability and agility is therefore resolved for 
the first time. 

Increased agility can be perceived in the following dynamic benefits: 

• Smaller steering angle reguirement 

• Less of a tendency to understeer 

The vehicle responds more sensitively to steering input. With 
asymmetric drive torgue distribution at the rear axle, Dynamic 
Performance Control effects an optimum yaw moment. 

This controlled additional torgue about the vertical axis of the vehi¬ 
cle makes it more "willing" to turn corners and reduces the amount 
of steering input reguired. 


Increased agility in cases of understeer 



Less steering effort means greater steering comfort, reduced 
understeer and more precise steering through corners. 









Greater Directional Stability 

As well as the considerably increased responsiveness of the vehicle 
with less steering input, any oversteer can also be noticeably con¬ 
trolled by the distribution of torque. 

Dynamic Performance Control increases vehicle safety by appropri¬ 
ately damping the rotational motion of the vehicle about the vertical 
axis. 

At the first sign of instability, e.g. oversteer, the drive torque at the 
rear axle is diverted to the wheel on the inside of the corner, thus 
preventing the rear of the vehicle from kicking out. 

As soon as the vehicle is dynamically stable again, the torque 
distribution by xDrive also returns to the basic 40:60 distribution. 

If the directional stability still remains close to the limit, DSC will 
of course also intervene. In this way, the various dynamic driving 
systems work together, coordinated by the Integrated Chassis 
Management, to achieve a common objective and to complement 
each other. 

The result is, for example, more easily controlled vehicle behavior 
when you need to take evasive action.

Operating Modes and Displays 
Normal Mode 

The Dynamic Performance Control functions cannot be switched 
on and off. The system is available once the engine is switched on. 

Evidently, no torque is transferred in gear R because the vehicle is 
stationary and no power is being transmitted to the wheels. 
However, in gears N and R, the system can affect torque transfer. 

The driver will get a new functional display for Dynamic 
Performance Control, which can be called up as one of the on¬ 
board computer screens and make permanently visible in the 
instrument cluster. If the display for Dynamic Performance Control 
was active last time the vehicle was driven, it will automatically 
appear again the next time the vehicle is driven. 

Due to legal requirements, the vehicle's odometer reading must 
always be displayed for a fixed time after the engine is started. For 
this reason, a small symbol for Dynamic Performance Control 
appears when the engine is started with the odometer reading 
underneath it. This small symbol is also displayed if the driver 
switches to the Dynamic Performance Control screen from 
another on-board computer screen. 

After a few seconds, the symbol is switched to full size for better 
legibility. It shows the drive train and the vehicle wheels from above, 
as well as the current torque distribution by xDrive and Dynamic 
Performance Control. 

The amount of torque at a wheel is shown by the number of narrow 
segments. Together, the segments form a bar, the length of which 
is a measurement of the amount of torque at the wheel. In this 
view, only positive values are possible. If the torque drops to a value 
of 0 Nm, the segments disappear completely from the wheel con¬ 
cerned. Negative values are also displayed like this and so cannot 
be clearly indicated. 


A few typical examples of the display with the full-size symbol are 
shown below.

Break-in Phase 

There are no different or additional running-in instructions for the 
rear differential with superimposing gear units than those that 
already exist for the conventional rear differential. Nor is there any 
diminished or reduced functionality due to the new rear differential. 

Wear Over the Service Life 

Notable wear occurs to two system components of the rear differ¬ 
ential: the multi-plate clutches and the transmission oil in the 
superimposing gear units (see also the System components sec¬ 
tion). There are mathematical models for these two components 
that either compensate for the wear or monitor for impermissibly 
high values. 

Continuous wear to the multi-plate clutches is offset by appropriate 
control of the electric motors. Constant adaptation processes run¬ 
ning in the background determine the position of the electric 
motors at which there is no torque transfer. The last detected "zero 
position" during a driving cycle is saved in the QMVH control unit 
and is available as the start value for the next driving cycle. 

Wear to the multi-plate clutches can be compensated for through¬ 
out their entire service life. This is ensured by their design and the 
configuration of the electric motor adjustment range. 

Frictional wear and loading due to high temperatures also age the 
transmission oil in the superimposing gear units. For this reason, a 
wear algorithm is calculated that takes account of the following vari¬ 
ables: 

• Age of the transmission oil in the superimposing gear units 

• Number of times a superimposing gear unit has been actuated 

• Temperature of the transmission oil in the superimposing 
gear units 


If the vehicle is driven with a normal or even a dynamic driving 
style, the transmission oil can be used for the entire service life of 
the vehicle without requiring changing. The result of the wear algo¬ 
rithm remains in the permissible range. 

Only if the vehicle is driven with an extremely sporty driving style 
might it become necessary to change the transmission oil during 
the vehicle's lifetime. The wear algorithm then generates a fault 
code memory entry. The diagnostic system uses this fault code 
memory entry to suggest a transmission oil change. 

Please note that when we talk here about transmission oil and 
changing it, we are only referring to the two reservoirs of the super¬ 
imposing gear units. 

The oil in the differential is a service life supply, as before. 

Driving Off with a Limited Steering Angle Signal 

The steering angle sensor in the steering column switch cluster 
(SZL) is only able to measure the relative steering angle directly. 

Its measuring range is between -180° and +180°. 

The absolute steering angle can be calculated from the relative 
steering angle by counting the steering-wheel turns. This informa¬ 
tion is lost if the SZL not supplied with voltage (e.g. if the battery 
is disconnected). When the vehicle is subsequently started, only 
the relative steering angle is available initially. The SZL uses the 
signals from the wheel-speed sensors to determine the information 
about the steering-wheel rotation when first pulling away. 

The following situation can be particularly problematic for all-wheel 
drive vehicles. The SZL was disconnected from the voltage supply. 
The vehicle is started on a snow covered road, for example. The 
driver depresses the accelerator pedal forcefully to pull away caus¬ 
ing all the wheels to spin and requiring ASC+T to brake them 
again. 


E71 Chassis Dynamics Workbook

In this situation, the SZL may not be able to immediately determine 
the information about the steering wheel rotation. It is not possible 
again until the slipping stops. In the meantime, the full functions of 
Dynamic Stability Control and Dynamic Performance Control are 
not available. 


Excessive Temperature 

Excessive temperature can occur in the two electric motors or in 
the transmission oil in the superimposing gear units. Excessive 
temperature can cause damage to components or unduly high 
levels of wear. 


During this transition period, the driver is informed of the limited 
availability of the stability control systems by the DSC warning lamp 
and a Check Control message. 

However, in this case, it is not a question of a fault, but a temporary 
unavailability of the systems. In the event of a complaint, the cus¬ 
tomer should be informed of this possibility. 


The following measures are applied to prevent this. 

Degradation of the torque transfer as a function of temperature

Note: The system is able to detect a "sporty driving style". 
If it does so, the temperature threshold is temporarily 
increased by approximately 25°C. 


















The temperature of the electric motors and the transmission oil in 
the two superimposing gear units is measured. The signals from 
the temperature sensors are analyzed by the QMVH control unit. 

In the first temperature range, the QMVH control unit makes avail¬ 
able the full amount of torgue transfer (M T1 = 100%). If the limit 
value Tt is exceeded, the QMVH control unit reduces the torque 
transfer performance. 

In the example shown, the transmission oil in one superimposing 
gear unit has temperature T 2 . The torque transfer is then reduced 
to M T2 = 80%. If the Integrated Chassis Management requires a 
torque transfer of 1,000 Nm, only 800 Nm is provided by the 
QMVH control unit. 


The reduced performance is reported back to the ICM control unit, 
so that it can be taken into consideration for the higher-level 
dynamic driving control. The reduced work of the superimposing 
gear units reduces the input of frictional heat, thereby preventing 
further heating. 


The driver is not informed of the limited function of Dynamic 
Performance Control until the vehicle handling is markedly altered 
by the reduction in torque transfer. This threshold is marked as M T3 
in the diagram. The relevant display - see below - is not activated 
until this point. 



xDrive and/or DPC not available 


System Not Available 

If xDrive or Dynamic Performance Control (or both) is not available, 
the function display is dimmed. Because the customer does not 
then benefit from the large bar display, the display is also switched 
to the smaller symbol size. 


The driver cannot determine whether xDrive or Dynamic 
Performance Control is causing the fault in the system using only 
the dimmed function display. The distinction can be made using 
the associated Check Control message. 

A failure of Dynamic Performance Control has a similar effect to the 
failure of Dynamic Stability Control. Driving stability is limited. 


Therefore, if there is a system fault in Dynamic Performance 
Control, the same Check Control symbol is used as for DSC. An 
instruction in the Central Information Display asks the driver to drive 
carefully. In addition to this Check Control message, the fixed warn¬ 
ing lamp in the instrument cluster is constantly lit yellow.

Dynamic Performance Control in the ICM network 

The ICM control unit's monitoring of the driving situation can be 
used for both systems (AL/AFS and DPC). The interpretation of the 
directional input at the steering wheel by the driver is also of use for 
the two systems. For the Dynamic Performance Control system, 
the engine torgue reguested by the driver and the torgue provided 
at the transmission output are also analyzed. The ICM control unit 
therefore reads the relevant signals from the engine control system 
and the electronic transmission control system. 

A particular feature in the ICM network is the xDrive system, which 
is used to help control the longitudinal distribution of the drive 
torgue. 

As in the all-wheel-drive vehicles already available on the market, 
the DSC control unit in the E71 continues to calculate the setpoint 
value for the distribution of the drive torgue between the front and 
rear axles. The transfer case control unit applies this setpoint value 
and feeds back the actual value of the torgue distribution. In the 
E71, it is no longer only the DSC control unit that receives this sig¬ 
nal, but also the ICM control unit, so that the drive torgue available 
at the rear axle can be determined. 

Using the current driving situation, the driver's input and the drive 
torgue available at the rear axle, the Integrated Chassis 
Management calculates a setpoint value for the QMVH control unit. 
This specifies how much drive torgue should be transferred from 
which rear wheel to the other and is sent via the ICM-CAN. 

The QMVH control unit has the task of implementing this setpoint 
value by energizing the actuating elements. In doing so, it must first 
detect which side, i.e. which of the two superimposing gear units, 
needs to be energized. This should occur on the side on which the 
greater drive torgue should be applied. 

The QMVH control unit in the E71 is purely an actuating control 
unit, in a similar way to the Active Steering control unit.

In order to ensure that the setpoint value is applied, the QMVH 
control unit reads the signals from the motor position sensors. 
There is also motor position control for Dynamic Performance 
Control in the same way as for Active Steering. 

The QMVH control unit uses the motor position to determine the 
drive torgue that is actually transferred and transmits this informa¬ 
tion back to the ICM control unit. 

The interface between the ICM control unit and the instrument 
cluster serves to activate the function displays and to indicate fault 
statuses. See the "Operating modes and displays" section.

Service Information 


Running-in Phase 

There are no different or additional running-in instructions for the 
rear differential with superimposing gear units than those that 
already exist for the conventional rear differential. 

Driving Off with a Limited Steering Angle Signal 

If the steering column switch cluster (SZL) has been disconnected 
from the voltage supply, only the relative steering angle can initially 
be measured. The SZL does not calculate the absolute steering 
angle using the wheel speed signals for calibration until the vehi¬ 
cle has been driven for a few meters. 

Until this point, only limited functions of the Dynamic Stability 
Control and Dynamic Performance Control dynamic driving sys¬ 
tems are available. The driver will not normally notice this phase. 

A Check Control message is only issued if the driver pulls away 
sharply on a surface with low friction immediately after the engine 
has been started. However, there is not a technical fault. Once the 
steering angle sensor has been calibrated with the wheel speeds, 
all functions of the dynamic driving systems are automatically 
available again. 

Excessive Temperature 

Excessive temperature can occur in the electric motors or in the 
transmission oil in the superimposing gear units. This can cause 
damage to components or unduly high levels of wear. To prevent 
this, the reguested torgue transfer is only implemented to a 
reduced extent if excessive temperature is detected. 

This reduction happens without the driver noticing. A Check 
Control message is not issued until the vehicle's behavior is 


noticeably altered by the reduction. A careful driving style will 
automatically result in the components being cooled, so that the 
full functionality is soon available again. 

The system is able to detect a "sporty driving style". If it does so, 
the temperature threshold is temporarily increased by approxi¬ 
mately 25°C. 

QMVH Unit 

The angle when the rear differential with superimposing gear 
units is removed and refitted must be no more than 45° due to 
risk of the oils mixing together through the common vent. 

Electric Motors 

The following must be observed when one or both of the electric 
motors are being replaced: 

• When an electric motor is removed, small guantities of oil 
may escape. This volume of oil is so small in relation to the 
overall volume that it is not necessary to top up the trans¬ 
mission oil. 

• Only the correct left/right motor may be used for the 
replacement. Identify the electric motor correctly using the 
Electronic Parts Catalogue. 

• Following the replacement of one or two new electric 
motors, a set-up process must be started using the diag¬ 
nostic system. This will transfer data from the motor position 
sensor to the QMVH control unit. 




Control Unit 

The QMVH control unit continuously calculates wear data for the 
transmission oil and multi-plate clutches during normal operation. 
The control unit also reconciles the control unit data with the fitted 
electric motors. 

A digital interface with the motor position sensors is used for this 
purpose. This results in the following particularities if the QMVH 
control unit needs to be replaced during the course of a repair. 

Before The QMVH control unit is removed, all data regarding the 
status of the rear differential with superimposing gear units must 
be read out, if possible, using the diagnostic system. 

Once the new QMVH control unit has been fitted, programmed 
and coded, the diagnostic system must be used to work through a 
set-up procedure. 

During this, the data that was previously read out regarding the sta¬ 
tus of the rear differential with superimposing gear units will be 
written to the new control unit. The control unit will also be set to a 
mode which restarts all adaptation processes, so that perfect inter¬ 
action between the control unit and the superimposing gear units 
can be established as soon as possible. 

ICM Control Unit 

When the ICM control unit is coded, the vehicle identification num¬ 
ber is written to the control unit. This means that a simple 
exchange between two vehicles does not provide a solution to a 
fault. Following the programming or replacement of an ICM control 
unit, coding must therefore be carried out. This is part of the set-up 
process conducted by the diagnostic system. 

During normal driving, the ICM control unit carries out calibration 
processes on the sensor signals. The offset of the steering wheel 
angle is determined in this way, for example. Values of this type are 
reguired for the higher-level dynamic driving regulation. Following 


the programming or replacement of an ICM control unit, these cali¬ 
bration processes must be explicitly initiated. The diagnostic sys¬ 
tem has a corresponding Service function. 

The actual calibration process does not take place until the next 
trip. The sensor signals cannot be calibrated to each other until the 
dynamic situations actually occur. This process takes place in the 
background, so that the customer will not realize it is happening. 

As you were already able to see from the bus overview and the dis¬ 
tributed functionality, the ICM control unit is not an independent 
control unit. Instead, it is in a close network with the QMVH and 
AL control units and, of course, the DSC. All these control units 
use similar or identical sensor signals (e.g. wheel speeds, yaw rate, 
steering wheel angle). Take this background information into con¬ 
sideration when performing diagnostics on the dynamic driving 
systems, for example, do not only check the fault memories of the 
individual control units, but the fault memories of all the control 
units in the network.
