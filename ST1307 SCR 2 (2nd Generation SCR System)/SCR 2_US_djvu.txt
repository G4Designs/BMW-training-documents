SCR 2 (US) 

1. Introduction 


The abbreviation SCR stands for Selective Catalytic Reduction. This is currently the most effective 
system for the reduction of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas. 

This system is model-specific and is now being used for all current BMW diesel engines in USA as well 
as in other markets. It is necessary to comply with the EURO 6 exhaust emission standards (in Europe) 
as well with the US EPA and CARB emission regulations. Although the new US market diesels are 
certified to the more stringent ULEVII (California) standard in some states the requirement is still Tier 
2, Bin 5 (LEV II). Compliance with these regulations has been possible by combining SCR the already 
known emission systems such as NSC (NOx storage catalytic converter), EGR (low-pressure exhaust- 
gas recirculation) and DPF (diesel particulate filter) and the internal engine measures. Therefore the 
requirements of the CARB and EURO 6 exhaust emission standards are also fulfilled in the cold-start 
phase, when the SCR system is not yet operational. 

BMW already has experience with the SCR system as it has been used in the BMW diesel fuel models 
in the US market since 2008. 

The special feature of the SCR system is the additional used of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®), a 
supply of which is stored and carried in the vehicle. This urea/water mixture is generally known under 

the brand name “AdBlue®” and also referred to as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF). 

The system is managed at BMW under the marketing name “BMW BluePerformance”. 

This document discusses the second generation of the SCR system (SCR 2) with regard to 
the US market specifications. The system is based on the previous US SCR system as well 
on the EURO 6 and is installed in combination with the second generation diesel engines the 
N47TU and the N57TU.

1.2.1. Second generation diesel emission system 

Although the second generation diesels are certified to the more stringent ULEVII (California) standard 
in some states the requirement is still Tier 2, Bin 5 (LEV II). The basic design of the exhaust emission 
system in the US market is very similar to the previous system. However, a more powerful system for 
exhaust gas treatment is required to meet increasingly stringent emissions regulations in spite of lower

exhaust temperatures and high efficiency diesel engines. These special measures and components 
apply exclusively to the US market models with the second generation diesel engines the N47TU and 
N57TU mentioned above (N47D20O1 and N57D30O1). 

The most notable features of the second generation diesel exhaust after treatment system are listed 
below: 

• Where the pervious system used an oxidation catalyst there is now a NOx Storage Catalyst 
(NSC) installed. The NSC is a NOx adsorption (storage) catalyst which incorporates the 
precious metals Platinum, Palladium and Rhodium and is installed in the same housing as the 
Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). 

• There is also now an additional O 2 sensor (downstream of the DPF). 

It is used to monitor the function of the NSC and to determine whether it needs to be 
regenerated. 

• The new system also incorporates the second generation SCR system (SCR 2) which is 
described in detail in this training material. 

The combination of a NOx Storage Catalyst (NSC) and SCR catalyst has significant 
advantages for the exhaust gas after-treatment due to the efficiency of the NSC especially 
under lean conditions. 

• In addition, for the first time there is also a particulate matter sensor (located down stream of 
the SCR). This sensor is used to monitor and manage the efficiency of the diesel particulate 
filter (DPF) in order to maintain the soot emission levels well below the mandated guidelines. 

A 

This training manual only describes the SCR 2 system. See the “N47TU Engine” and “N57TU 
Engine” reference manuals (available on TIS and ICP), as well as, OL1310 “2nd Generation 
Diesel Technology” online training (available on ICP) for more information.

SCR 2 (US) 

2. Summary 

The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is a system for the reduction of nitrogen oxides NO x (nitrogen 
monoxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO 2 ) in the exhaust gas. As with the previous system a reducer 

(urea/water mixture) (AdBlue®) is directly injected into the exhaust gas after the diesel particulate filter 
before the SCR catalytic converter. 

The response to the nitrogen oxide reduction then takes place in the SCR catalytic converter. 

The urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is stored in the vehicle in one or two tanks. The volume is enough to 
guarantee a high range. 

The following graphic shows a simplified schematic diagram of the system:

The reason for using two tanks is that the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) freezes at -11 °C (12.2 °F). 
The active tank is therefore heated. This prevents the entire volume of the urea/water mixture 

(AdBlue ) having to be heated, which saves energy. Also the stretching of the top-up intervals for 

® 

covering longer distances between the tank processes for the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is a 
reason that two expansion tanks are installed (depending on the model). 

The heated tank is called the active tank. From here the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is sent through 
the SCR delivery module to the metering module (this pipe is also heated). 

The unheated tank is the passive tank. The transfer pump unit regularly ensures that the urea/water 
mixture (AdBlue®) is pumped from the passive tank to the active tank. 

This documentation sometimes describes and shows the system with two tanks, the functions of 
the one tank version are generally the same, the additional components required for the second tank 
system can be omitted for the one-tank system. 

The FI 0 535d for the US market only has one tank (active tank). 


2.1. Differences between SCR 2 - SCR 

The SCR 2 was introduced to save components in comparison to the first generation. The advantages 
are cost savings and reduction in the variants, such as no longer two different Digital Diesel Electronics 
(DDE) hardware components. The Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE) hardware can be used for all series. 
If the SCR system is installed, a SCR dosing control unit (DCU) is also installed.

SCR 2 (US) 

2. Summary 

The SCR 2 differs to the SCR with regard to the following characteristics: 

• SCR 2 control is housed in its own SCR control unit (Dosing Control Unit, DCU). 

• SCR 2 strategy is in the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE). 

• Elimination of the reversing valve; two pumps are used instead. 

• Level sensors are contactless and operate on ultrasonic basis. 

• Pressure determination based on calculated pressure module, therefore the pressure sensor 
is no longer required. 

• Draining connections were eliminated (these became redundant due to the level sensor). 

• Metering module is now cooled by the engine cooling system. 

• Only one filler connection of the SCR system for active tank and passive tank, (except FI 5 
which still has 2 different filling ports like E70). 

• Encapsulated components without direct contact to the medium (avoids components damage 
due to contact with the corrosive DEF).

2. Summary 

In the FI 0 with the N57D30O1 a 15 liter capacity active tank is installed, which is located in the vehicle 
underbody at the rear right. A passive tank is not installed in the US market FI 0. The filler connection 

for the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is located in the fuel filler flap beside the (diesel) fuel filler neck at 
the rear right of the vehicle. 

In the F30 with the N47D20O1 an 8,7 liter capacity active tank is used, which is located in the vehicle 
underbody in front of the right rear wheel. The F30 passive tank is located behind the right rear wheel 

an has 9,4 liters. The filler connection for the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is located in the fuel filler 
flap beside the (diesel) fuel filler neck at the rear right of the vehicle. 

The F31 has the same SCR system as F30 therefore the tanks have the same capacity and are 
installed in the same general locations. 

In the FI 5 the active tank has a max volume of 13,7 liters and the passive tank has a 15,3 liter capacity. 
The active tank is located on the right side of the vehicle directly behind the front bumper cover. 

And the passive tank is located in the vehicle underbody in the area under the front seats. The filler 

connections for the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) are located in the engine compartment. The passive 
tank filler point is at the same position as E70 (on the left side of the engine compartment). 

The different tank sizes result from the available installation areas in the different series. 

The installation location of the SCR dosing control unit (DCU) varies from series to series. The SCR 
control is housed in the DCU while the strategy is still integrated in the Digital Diesel Electronics.

3. Functions 


The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is currently the most effective system for the reduction of 
nitrogen oxides (NO x ). During its operation the system achieves an efficiency of almost 100 % and 
over the entire vehicle operation about 90%. The difference can be found in the time that the system 
requires to be operational after a cold start. 

A urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is used as a reducer agent and is stored and carried in the vehicle.

Temperature sensor after the diesel particulate filter 


The urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is injected into the exhaust pipe via the metering module before 
the SCR catalytic converter. The Digital Engine Electronics (DDE) calculates how much has to be 
injected. The nitrogen oxide content in the exhaust gas is calculated via the NO x sensor before the 

SCR catalytic converter. Using this value the exact required amount of urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is 
injected in order to completely reduce the nitrogen oxides. 

The urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) transforms into ammonia in the exhaust pipe. The ammonia reacts 
in the SCR catalytic converter with the nitrogen oxides and nitrogen (N 2 ) and water (H 2 O) are created. 

Behind the SCR catalytic converter there is a second NO x sensor which monitors the function, (see 
3.2.1) 

A temperature sensor located in the exhaust pipe behind the diesel particulate filter (before the SCR 
catalytic converter and the metering module) also influences the function because the injection of the 

urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) begins only once 170 °C (338 °F) is reached. 


17 










SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 

3.1. Chemical reaction 

The SCR system significantly reduces the nitrogen oxides (NO x ) in the exhaust gas. 
The nitrogen oxides occur in two different forms: 

• Nitrogen monoxide (NO) 

• Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). 


NO N0 2 § 

Nitrogen oxides 


Ammonia (NH 3 ) is used for the reduction of the nitrogen oxides in a special catalytic converter. 



Ammonia 


The ammonia is delivered via a urea/water mixture (AdBlue ). 



The urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is injected via the metering module into the exhaust system 
downstream of the diesel particulate filter. The required quantity must be exactly metered as otherwise 
nitrogen oxides or ammonia would escape. The following description of the chemical processes 
should explain why this is the case.

3. Functions 


3.1.1. Transformation of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) 

(r) 

The equal distribution of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) in the exhaust gas and the transformation 
into ammonia takes place in the exhaust pipe before the SCR catalytic converter. 

First, the urea dissolved in the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) ((NH 2 ) 2 CO) is released.

Releasing the urea from the urea/water mixture (AdBlue u ) 


The transformation of the urea into ammonia takes place in two stages. 


Thermolysis 

Explanation 


In the thermolysis the urea/water mixture 
(AdBlue ) is split into two products by heating.

Thermolysis: Urea becomes ammonia and isocyanic acid 



In the thermolysis only a part of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is transformed into ammonia. 
The rest is isocyanic acid and is transformed in a second step.

SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


Hydrolysis 

Explanation 

The isocyanic acid, that was created during the 
thermolysis, is also transformed into ammonia 
and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) during the hydrolysis 
through the addition of water.

Hydrolysis: Isocyanic acid reacts with water and becomes ammonia and carbon dioxide 


The required water is also delivered via the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®). 

Therefore, after the hydrolysis the entire urea is transformed into ammonia and carbon dioxide.

Reduction 

Explanation 

The catalytic converter enables a "docking" of 
the ammonia molecules. The nitrogen oxide 
molecules meet the ammonia molecules and 
the reaction begins. This releases energy and is

N0 X reduction: Nitrogen oxides react with ammonia and become nitrogen and water 


It is possible to recognize that at the end each individual atom has found its place again. So, there are 
the exact same amount of elements on the left side as on the right. This only happens if the ratio of 

d) 

urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) to nitrogen oxides is correct. 

If too little urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is injected then nitrogen oxides escape. If too much urea/ 

water mixture (AdBlue®) is injected then ammonia escapes, which could lead to unpleasant odors and 
environmental damage (ammonia slip). 


3.2. SCR control 

The SCR control is divided into the dosing system control, which is implemented by the SCR dosing 
control unit (DCU), and the metering strategy, which is defined by the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE).

Exhaust-gas temperature sensor 


The Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE) assumes the following functions: 

• Evaluation of the nitrogen oxide sensor 

• Evaluation of the exhaust-gas temperature sensor 

Calculation of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) amount and 
transmission to the SCR dosing control unit (DCU) via PT-CAN 

• Control of the engine shut down scenario. 

3.2.1. Metering strategy 

The metering strategy in the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE) is the part of the SCR control that 
calculates how much urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is injected at which time. 

The signal of the NO x sensor before the SCR catalytic converter is used for the calculation of the 
quantity in normal operation. This calculates the amount of nitrogen oxide in the exhaust gas and 
transmits the value to the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE). 

However, the NO x sensor must reach its operating temperature in order to begin measuring. 
Depending on the ambient temperature this can take up to 15 min. Until this point a substitute value 
from the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE) is calculated for the determination of the nitrogen oxide 
quantity in the exhaust gas. 

In order to monitor the system there is a second NO x sensor downstream of the SCR catalytic 
converter. It measures whether there are still nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas. If this is the case, 
then the fluid injection rate of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is adapted. The NO x sensor not only 
measures the nitrogen oxides, but also ammonia, but is unable to make a distinction between the two. 

If too much urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is injected, then the nitrogen oxides are fully reduced, 
however, there is an increased risk of a so-called "ammonia slip", i.e. ammonia escapes from the SCR 
catalytic converter. The value is increased as the NO x sensor measures again. Therefore, the target is 
to reach a minimum of the sensor value.

However, this is a long-term adaptation and not a short-term control as the SCR catalytic converter has 
a memory function for ammonia. 


3.2.2. Metering system control 

The metering system control in the SCR dosing control unit (DCU) is the part which performs the 
metering functions. It implements the requirements set by the metering strategy in the DDE. This 

includes both the metering and the injection of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) as well as the supply 
of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®). 

The tasks of the metering system control (in normal operation) are listed below: 

Metering of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ): 

Implementation of the required target amount of urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) 

• ® 

Return of the required urea/water mixture actual quantity (AdBlue ). 

® 

Supply of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ): 

• Provision of the metering ability (fill lines and pressure build-up) 
under certain ambient conditions (temperature) 

• Empty lines at after-run 

• Activation of the heating. 


24 













SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 

® 

3.3. Supply of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) 

An adequate supply of urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is required for the proper operation of the 
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. Furthermore, this medium must be stored in the vehicle 
and made available as quickly as it is necessary under all ambient conditions. In this case making 

available means that the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) should be under a required pressure at the 
metering valve. 


3.4. Metering of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) 

The metering strategy establishes the quantity of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) that should be 
injected. The metering system control now ensures the implementation of this requirement. The 
metering activation is a part of the function from which the actual opening of the metering valve is 
determined. 

Depending on engine load level and vehicle speed, the metering valve injects with a frequency of 
0.3 Hz to 1.0 Hz. 

The dosing valve is actuated with 0,3 Hz in Idle condition for acoustic reasons and at 0,9 Hz 
when a high dosing amount is requested. 

In order to inject the right amount the metering control calculates following: 

• the duty cycle for the actuator of the metering valve in order to ascertain the injection period 

• the activation delay for the compensation of the metering valve inertia. 

The metering system control also calculates the actual metered amount and sends this back to the 
metering strategy. 

The metering amount is also calculated over a longer period of time. This long period calculation is 
reset upon refilling. 

In order to fulfill these tasks various functions are necessary that are described in the following section. 

3.4.1. Heating 

(r) 

The SCR system must also be heated as the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) freezes at a temperature of 
-11 °C (12.2 °F). 

The heating function has the following tasks: 

• Monitoring of the temperatures in the active tank and its surrounding area. 

Thawing of a sufficient amount of urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) and the components required 
for metering at system start. 

• Prevention of freezing of the relevant components during operation. 

• Monitoring of the components of the heating system. 


25 



SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


Following components are heated: 

• Active tank. 

• Metering line (from the active tank to the metering module). 

• SCR delivery module via the coils of the supply pump and return pump. 

The heating of the active tank is adjusted depending on the temperature in the active tank and the 
ambient temperature. The required control of the heating for the metering line and the heating for the 
SCR delivery module are based on the current ambient temperature values. 

Each heater circuit is supplied with power by a semiconductor switch (driver). These power 
semiconductors are designed as high side switches, which are switched directly by the control unit. 
With help of the shunt measuring principle, the SCR dosing control unit (DCU) calculates the actual 
current, which flows over the heating elements. The DCU can also perform a function check of the 
heater circuits and thus detect any faults which are stored in the fault memory. 

A temperature model is used for the heating of the components in order to establish the metering 
readiness. 

With the temperature model, the following three basic parameters are set so that metering readiness 
can be reached. 

The following values are defined by law and must be observed: 

• at -25 °C (-13 °F) the metering readiness is reached after 45 minutes 

• at -15 °C (5 °F) the metering readiness is reached after 20 minutes 

• at -9 °C (15.8 °F) the metering readiness is reached after 3 minutes. 

The following table shows the metering readiness in relation to the temperature: 



Index 

Explanation 

t [min] 

Time in minutes 

°C 

Temperature in degree Celsius 


At a temperature under -9 °C (15.8 °F) in the active tank the metering readiness is delayed, i.e. a 
defined time is waited until a pressure build-up begins. This time is constant from -9 °C to -15 °C (15.8 

°F to 5 °F) as it cannot be ascertained at which degree the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is frozen. 
Under -15 °C (5 °F) the heating period extends until a pressure build-up attempt. 


26 










SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


Generally heating up the metering line is significantly faster which is why the temperature in the 
active tank is decisive for the period until a pressure build-up attempt has been undertaken. If there is 
significantly lower ambient temperature than the temperature in the active tank the warm-up phase of 
the metering line becomes longer. Then the ambient temperature is used for the delay of the metering 
readiness. 


3.4.2. Transfer pumping 

As the storage of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) generally requires two tanks (depending on the 
model) a transfer pumping system is required. 

The delivery of urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) from the passive to the active tank is described as 
transfer pumping. 

® 

During transfer pumping the transfer pump unit pumps the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) from the 
passive tank to the filling pipe. The filling pipe in the active tank is located below the filling pipe of 

® 

the passive tank, therefore the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) does not return to the passive tank, but 
always flows to the active tank. 

The following (ECE model FI 0) image shows the installation locations of the filling and storage 
components. Although the image is not US model specific it is used here purely as an example for 
better understanding the DEF supply system:

The following preconditions must be met for transfer pumping: 


9 (§) 

Urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is present in the passive tank. 

• The ambient temperature is at least ten degrees above a minimum value of -7 °C (19.4 °F) in 
the case of a longer engine switch-off time. 

• The ambient temperature is at least ten degrees above a minimum value of -0 °C (32 °F) in the 
case of a shorter engine switch-off time. 

• 300 grams of volume is available in the active tank (300 grams of available capacity must be 
present in the active tank in order to not overfill the active tank). 

Active tank and passive tank contain a liquid urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) (tank temperature 
below -5 °C (23 °F)). 

Then enough time is spent re-pumping until the active tank is full again. If the level "full" is reached 
before this the transfer pumping is stopped.

3.4.3. Delivery 

The supply pump is located in the SCR delivery module and is used to deliver the urea/water mixture 
(AdBlue®) from the active tank to the metering module. 

The SCR delivery module incorporates the following components: 

• Filter

When heating with the pump coil, the supply pump is activated via a pulse-width modulated signal 
(PWM) by the SCR dosing control unit (DCU). This is done to limit the current for the DCU and the heat 
for the coil. The PWM is adjusted according to the actual voltage at the DCU. 

PWM is not used for normal pump operation. The activation of the pump is for a defined time in order 
to make a full stroke. This defined time depends on the actual voltage and the pressure in the system. 

The new system does not use a pressure sensor. The pressure is modeled by the characteristic profile 
of the measured current of the supply pump. The current profile has 2 characteristic points: These are 
the “Beginning of Movement of Pump” (BMP) and the “End of Movement of the Pump” (MSP 
-mechanical stop of pump). These points are derived from the changing inductivity of the coil (when 
the plunger starts moving and stops at the end). New pressure values are only available if the pump is 
activated therefore there are no new pressure values without pumping. 

The PWM operating method is therefore only used for heating. When pumping the pump is always 
fully actuated to make a full stroke or fill the line. The supply line is filled until the metering module, 
then the pressure build-up mode takes place. Only then does the pressure regulation take place. 

When filling the metering line a small amount of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is injected into the 
exhaust system as the metering valve is open. 

The SCR 2 operates with volumetric delivery/dosing. The dosed amount is determined by the high 
accuracy of the supply pump. The injector must always dose the amount that is pumped into the line. 
Under normal conditions the system should run at about 6.5 bar but because the system is installed in 
various vehicles this pressure may vary between 5 and 8 bar depending on the model. 

For example: In case of a weak pump with a big injector the pressure will be about 5 bar. And with a 
strong pump and a small injector it will be about 8 bar. These are all acceptable pressures for these 
system. A fault will be set only if the pressure drops below 4,5 bar or exceeds the 9 bar limit. 

The quantity delivered is determined by the opening period and opening stroke of the metering valve. 
However, this is so short that there is virtually no pressure drop in the metering line. 


3.4.4. Evacuating 

After the engine is stopped, the return pump of the SCR delivery module is activated and the metering 
line and the metering module are evacuated (drawn off).

Even if the system has to be switched off due to a fault or, for example, if the minimum temperature in 
the active tank can no longer be maintained, it is drawn off. 

Due to acoustic reasons the draining of the system is reduced to a minimum. Only the 
metering valve (injector) is drained. The line and the delivery module are ice resistant and are 
maintained filled. 

When evacuating the metering valve (injector) is open. 

3.4.5. Freezing conditions 

If the ambient conditions cause the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) to freeze, the SCR delivery module is 
protected by the ice pressure damper.

If the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) freezes (below -11 °C (12.2 °F), the SCR delivery module and its 
components are protected by the ice pressure damper. 

The ice pressure dampers allow an increased volume in the internal lines of the SCR delivery module 
thanks to their diaphragm, which is designed for the residual amount containing urea/water mixture 

(AdBlue ) in the SCR delivery module. The resulting increase in volume in the ice pressure dampers 
protects the internal components of the SCR delivery module by the ice formation. 

3.4.6. Level measurement and temperature measurement 

There are level sensors and temperature sensors in the active tank and passive tank (if installed). 

The ultrasonic level sensors can capture level readings in the range from 15 mm to 400 mm. The 
temperature sensors are embedded in the tank flange of the active tank and passive tank and work 
according to the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) principle. The signals of the level sensors and 
temperature sensors do not go directly to the SCR dosing control unit (DCU), but to an evaluation unit 
in the respective tank flange, as the SCR dosing control unit (DCU) cannot process the results of the 
ultrasonic sensors and temperature sensors directly. In the evaluation unit the ultrasonic values and 
measured values of the temperature sensors are converted to a pulse-width modulated signal (PWM 
signal), which can be processed by the SCR dosing control unit (DCU). 



Level measurement range of ultrasonic sensor 


Four pulse-width modulated signals are sent to the SCR dosing control unit (DCU): 2 level signals with 
a timeshift of 480ms, one for the temperature and one for the sensor status. 

These pulse-width modulated signals (PWM ) of level, temperature and status are transmitted in 120 
ms units to the SCR dosing control unit (DCU). 

The signal is implausible between 0 - 20 ms and 100-120 ms. 

Only one of the T1 -T5 signals is not used. 


36 













SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


The PWM signal is broken down as follows: 

T1: Temperature 

For the temperature measurement a PWM signal (pulse-width modulated signal) of 0 % clock ratio = 
20 ms of a temperature corresponds to urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) of -40° Celsius (-40 °F). 

For the temperature measurement a PWM signal (pulse-width modulated signal) of 50 % clock ratio = 
60 ms of a temperature corresponds to urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) of 20° Celsius (68 °F). 

For the temperature measurement a PWM signal of 100 % clock ratio = 100 ms of a temperature 
corresponds to urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) of 80° Celsius (176 °F). 

T2:1st level measurement 

For the first level measurement a PWM signal of 0 % clock ratio = 20 ms corresponds to a level of urea/ 
water mixture (AdBlue®) of 0 % 

For the first level measurement a PWM signal of 100 % clock ratio = 100 ms corresponds to a level of 
urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) of 100 % 

The level range of 15 mm to 400 mm is transmitted in a total of 771 stages with a solution of 0.5 mm. 

T3: currently not used 
T4: 2nd level measurement 

Similar to T2, for the second level measurement a level is only recorded every 480 ms. The 
transmission is effected via the PWM signal (pulse-width modulated signal) in the 960 ms grid. 
Therefore, two levels are transmitted per PWM signal. 

T5: Sensor status 

Is used for monitoring the five set-point values (T1 - T5) and checks whether all five power output 
stages have led to a measurement which can be evaluated. 

The sensor status is used to transmit the quality of the echoes. The level evaluation is only done if the 
status gives a good quality of the level signal. Out of Status 3, 4 or 5 the status 5 means that 5 equal 
measurements of the level were done.

3.5. SCR system conditions 

If the ignition is switched on then the SCR control in the SCR control unit (DCU) runs through a 
logical sequence of conditions. However, there are preconditions that set off the change from one 
condition to the other. The following graphic shows the procedure of the modes/conditions that are 
then described in the following. 

In comparison to the first generation SCR, there is an additional mode/condition for the SCR 2: 

• PURGE

3.5.1. “INIT (SCR initialization) 

The control unit is switched on (terminal 15 ON) and the SCR system is initialized. 


3.5.2. “STANDBY” (SCR standstill) 

The STANDBY condition is assumed either after initialization or if there are faults. 

If terminal 15 is switched off in this condition or if a fault occurs, it is switched to the AFTERRUN 
condition. 

3.5.3. “NOPRESSURECONTROL” (wait for approval for pressure regulation) 

The NOPRESSURECONTROL condition is reached if there are no faults in the system. In this 
condition there is a wait for the approval of the pressure regulation which takes place via the following 
sensor signals: 


40 















SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


• Temperature in the catalytic converter 

• Temperature in active tank 

• Ambient temperature 

• Engine status (engine running). 

In addition, the system pauses for a minimum time in the NOPRESSURECONTROL condition so that a 
plausibility check of the pressure model can be carried out. 

If the approval is then given it is switched to the PRESSURECONTROL condition. 

If terminal 15 is switched off in the condition NOPPRESSURECONTROL or a fault occurs, or the 
system should be reset (e.g. to improve metering accuracy or the pressure regulation), a switch is 
made to STANDBY condition. 

3.5.4. “PRESSURECONTROL” (SCR system running) 

The PRESSURECONTROL condition is the normal operating condition of the SCR system and has 
three sub-conditions. 

The PRESSURECONTROL condition remains as long as terminal 15 is switched off. Subsequently it 
is switched to the PRESSUREREDUCTION condition. 

If a fault occurs in the system it is also switched to the PRESSUREREDUCTION condition. 

In the following the sub-conditions of the PRESSURECONTROL condition are described: 

• “PRESSUREBUILDUP” (pressure build-up) 

In this condition the pressure is built-up to a certain value. Also, the supply pump is activated 
while the metering valve is closed. 

If the required pressure is built up within a certain time it is switched to the next condition: 
METERINGCONTROL. If the required pressure build-up is not reached after a certain amount 
of time or the condition unit goes into a slip, then it is switched to the VENTILATION condition. 
If the pressure cannot be built up after a certain defined number of attempts then the system 
indicates a fault and switches to the PRESSUREREREDUCTION condition. 

It also switches to the PRESSUREREDUCTION condition if terminal 15 is switched off or if a 
different fault occurs in the system. 

• “VENTILATION” (ventilation) 

VENTILATION is used for the ventilation of the pressure line and is performed for each 
PRESSUREBUILDUP. 

From a certain pressure threshold in the PRESSUREBUILDUP condition, the metering valve is 
first activated for a certain time at a defined opening width. The pressure is compared before 
and after the valve opening. If the pressure drop is over a certain threshold value, the value is 
activated again (this process can be repeated up to three or four times). 

If the pressure drop is less than the threshold value, or the metering value was activated 
four times, the VENTILATION condition is terminated and the system switches back to the 
PRESSUREBUILDUP condition. 

The system can build up normal pressure without or with insufficient VENTILATION and 
switch to the METERINGCONTROL condition. It may then transpire that upon the start of 
metering the system pressure collapses by the escape of air. In this case the system changes 
to the PURGE condition and then to PRESSUREBUILDUP. 


41 



SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


If terminal 15 is switched off during this time or if a fault occurs in the system a change in the 
PRESSUREREDUCTION condition takes place. 

• “METERINGCONTROL” (metering) 

In the METERINGCONTROL condition the system has metering release. It is the actual 

(B) 

condition in normal operation. Here the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is injected. 

If terminal 15 is switched off or if a fault occurs in the system, the condition also switches to 
PRESSUREREDUCTION. 


3.5.5. “PRESSUREREDUCTION” (pressure reduction in the SCR system) 

Upon entering PRESSUREREDUCTION the metering release is withdrawn. 

This condition ensures a pressure reduction in the SCR delivery module, the metering line and the 
metering module after the PRESSURECONTROL condition. In addition, the return pump is activated 
while the metering valve is closed. 

The end of the PRESSUREREDUCTION condition is reached by dropping below a certain pressure. 


3.5.6. “PURGE” 

In the PURGE state/mode the system is purged. This state has six sub-conditions. 

The system switches to PURGE state, if no pressure build-up is possible or there is a vacuum in the 
system. This condition may occur if, for example, air or a foreign body are in the system or valves are 
sticking. 

The purge state is used to remove air that might be in the supply pump. Both pumps are activated and 
the air can be purged into the tank again. Purge is activated if the pressure build up has failed or if the 
MSP/BMP cannot be found. 

After defrosting we purge the system to stabilize the conditions inside the delivery module. Purge can 
be activated with the ICID tester to remove the air out of the system for a new tank. 

If the PURGE state is exited, there is a switch to the initial condition before purging. This affects both 
the possible faults and the successful completion of the purging function. A reaction to the faults then 
takes place, if necessary, in the initial condition. 

• “PURGE INIT” (initialization of purging function) 

Based on the status of the initialization the transition to the required purging mode). 

• “PURGE VOLUMEBASED” (volume-based purging) 

In the condition PURGE VOLUMEBASED a defined volume of the urea/water mixture 

(AdBlue ) is pumped by the SCR delivery module. 

• “PURGE PRESSUREREDUCTION” (pressure reduction during purging) 

In the condition PURGE PRESSUREREDUCTION the pressure is reduced. 

• “PURGE FIRSTFILL” (initial filling during purging) 

In the condition PURGE FIRSTFILL the initial filling takes place. This condition can also be 
activated via the service functions in the diagnosis system (ISTA) and must be performed if 
components in the SCR system are replaced during servicing or upon the initial operation. 

• “PURGE PRESSURECHECK” (pressure build-up check during purging) 


42 



SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


In the condition PURGE PRESSURECHECK a pressure build-up attempt is performed to 
check the initial filling. If this is unsuccessful, the condition PURGE FILL is exited for further 
filling (watch out for external leaks). This condition can also be activated via the service 
functions in the diagnosis system (ISTA) and must be performed if components in the SCR 
system are replaced during servicing or upon the initial operation. 

• “PURGE FILL” (filling during purging) 

In the condition PURGE FILL the system is refilled. If the condition is exited successfully, a 
change to PURGE PRESSURECHECK takes place for further checking. 


3.5.7. “AFTERRUN” (after-run) 

In the AFTERRUN condition the system is shut down. 

If terminal 15 is switched on again before the after-run has come to an end the after-run is considered 
interrupted and the condition switches to STANDBY. If this is not the case, the sub-conditions of the 
AFTERRUN condition are run through. 

• “EMPTYING” (draining of the pressure line) 

After the cooling-down period it is switched to the sub-condition AFTERRUN EMPTYING. In 
this sub-condition the pressure line and the SCR delivery module are emptied. The urea/water 

mixture (AdBlue®) is suctioned by the return pump and the opening of the metering valve back 

to the active tank. This should prevent the freezing of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) in the 
metering line or in the metering module. 

If the pressure line is empty, a change to the condition AFTERRUN 
PRESSURECOMPENSATION takes place. 

It is also switched to the AFTERRUN PRESSURECOMPENSATION condition if there is a fault 
in the system. If terminal 15 is switched on it is switched to the STANDBY condition. 

• “WAITING FOR SHUTOFF” (switching off SCR) 

The control unit is shut down and switched off. 


3.5.8. Automatic engine start-stop function 

Under certain operating conditions an engine shutdown of the MSA may be influenced by the SCR 
control. 


• Remaining capacity undershot 

If the remaining capacity falls below 0 km/mls and there is no more urea/water mixture 
(AdBlue ) available, an automatic engine shutdown is prevented by the MSA. In the event 

that the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is not available and switch off scenario has initiated, 
an engine start is prevented (no engine operation is allowed without urea/water mixture 

(AdBlue®). 

3.6. Warning and switch off scenario 

The SCR system is required to meet the mandated exhaust-emission regulations. If the system fails, 
the approval is void and the vehicle can no longer be operated. A very plausible case which leads to a 

system failure is that the supply of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) runs out. 


43 



SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


Without urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) further operation of the vehicle is not allowed, therefore the 
engine can no longer be started. 

The control of the switch off scenario is done by the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE). 

So that it does not come as a surprise to the driver, there is a warning and switch off scenario that 
begins long enough before the disabling of the vehicle so that the customers can comfortably either 

refill the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) themselves or have someone else refill it for them. According to 
legal regulations (in the US) the first warning must have a range of 1000 mis based on a linear counter 
(as E70 and E90). 

3.6.1. Warning scenario 

Warning level 1 

At the start of the inducement (engine shut off scenario) a residual amount of DEF (about 3 liters 
in (F30) active tank, 3,2 liters for FI 0 and 3,5 liters in FI 5) should in any case be enough for 
a range of lOOOmls. The “linear counter” is started from this point irrespective of the actual DEF 
consumption. The driver receives a priority 1 Check Control message (white), with a check control 
message showing the remaining range. 

A range of 999 mis is actually displayed to provide a safety reserve margin. 

Check Control display: “Refill Exhaust Fluid Reserve/AdBlue, range: 999 mis” 



Check Control message in the instrument cluster at warning level 1 

At the same time, an instruction is also output via the central information display (CID): 

"Exhaust Fluid /AdBlue Reserve. Exhaust Fluid /AdBlue must be refilled. Have vehicle checked 
by your BMW Service Department." 

From this point onwards, the available range is counted downwards linearly, irrespective of actual urea/ 
water mixture (AdBlue ) consumption. 

Warning level 2 

If the fluid level sensor has dropped below “empty” then the driver receives a priority 2 Check Control 
message (yellow). "Refill DEF" and the remaining range is displayed in mis. Although there is still a 
DEF reserve in the active tank (which would normally allow a range greater that 200 mis) a range of 
199 mis is actually displayed to provide a safety reserve margin. 

Check Control display: “Refill Exhaust Fluid Reserve/AdBlue, range: 199 mis”

“Note range. Exhaust Fluid /AdBlue must be refilled, otherwise an engine start is no longer 
possible. Drive to the nearest BMW Service." 

Warning level 3 

If the range falls to 0 km/ml three lines are displayed instead of the range - next to the fluid range. 



Check Control message in the instrument cluster range = 0 km 

Check Control display: “Refill Exhaust Fluid /AdBlue, range:-” 

At the same time, an instruction is also output via the central information display (CID): 

“Refill Exhaust Fluid /AdBlue” 

“Engine start without Exhaust Fluid /AdBlue no longer possible. Exhaust Fluid /AdBlue must 
be refilled. Drive to the nearest BMW Service Department." 

3.6.2. Switch off scenario 

When the range of 0 km/ml has been met the next engine start is prevented, but only if the engine 
was switched off for more than three minutes. This ensures being able to escape any dangerous 
situations. 

There is normally a remaining 0.8 I in the system which is used as a safety reserve for the following 
scenario: 

The vehicle is filled up with fluid and is started with a very low urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) 

range (e.g. 1 km). The urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) range reaches 0 km/ml but the vehicle 
can still be driven until the next engine shutdown. Here it is ensured that the vehicle is still 
operated with a functioning SCR system, even in this case. 


3.6.3. Incorrect refilling 

There are 2 ways of monitoring wrong medium. A big amount was refilled and the NOx efficiency 
drops suddenly (increasing nitrogen oxide values in the exhaust gas despite the sufficient injection of 
the supposed urea/water mixture). Or if only small amounts are refilled several times (e.g. passive tank 


45 


SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


filled with water) the adaptation will increase the dosing quantity. In this case the car keeps emission 
compliant and the wrong medium detection will react a certain adaptation factor. From this point this is 
displayed by a Check Control display (display of range or a reduction of range is not displayed). 



Check Control message in the instrument cluster in the event the wrong medium is detected 

Check Control display: “Exhaust Fluid/AdBlue wrong medium” 

At the same time, an instruction is also output via the central information display (CID): 

“Exhaust Fluid/AdBlue wrong fluid” 

“Have vehicle checked by your BMW Service authorized workshop." 

3.6.4. System fault 


Faults, which prevent the metering of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) don't always lead to the 
implementation of the inducement (engine shut down) process. 

Pressure regulation error or disconnected components will only set a malfunction indicator light (MIL). 
This is why we have special (tamper proof) screws for the cover of the dosing valve (injector). 

In the event of a communication failure between the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE) and the SCR 
control unit (DCU) this will be indicated by a Check Control Message and the display of the 199 mis 
range along with the “Exhaust Fluid/AdBlue System Fault” warning. 

The engine shut down scenario will only initiate in the following cases: 

• If the tank is empty, the system will display the 999 mis CCM 

• If the wrong medium is detected, the system will display the 199 mis CCM 

• If no communication is detected between the DCU and DDE, the system will display the 199 
mis CCM 

A disconnected DCU or a removed/blown fuse for the DCU will lead to the inducement (engine 
shut off) process. VERIFY

3.7. On-board diagnosis functions 

The Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE) additionally has the task of monitoring all exhaust-relevant 
systems for their problem-free function. This task is described as an On-Board Diagnosis (OBD). If a 
fault is registered by the On-Board Diagnosis then the emissions warning light is activated. 

In the following the most important SCR specific results are explained that lead to the lighting up of the 
emissions warning light. 

3.7.1. SCR catalytic converter 

The effectiveness of the SCR catalytic converter is monitored by the two nitrogen oxide sensors. 


47 






SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


The nitrogen oxide mass is measured before and after the SCR catalytic converter and a sum is 
formed over a certain period. The actual reduction is compared to a calculated value which is stored in 
the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE). 

For this the following preconditions must be met: 

• NO x sensors plausible. 

• Metering active 

• Ambient temperature in the defined area. 

• Ambient pressure in the defined area. 

• Diesel particulate filter regeneration not active. 

• SCR catalytic converter temperature in the defined area (is calculated using exhaust-gas 
temperature sensor before the SCR catalytic converter amongst others). 

• Exhaust flow in the defined area. 

Monitoring includes four measuring cycles. If the actual value is lower than the one calculated 
a reversible fault is created. If the fault is determined in two consecutive driving cycles then an 
irreversible fault is stored and the emissions warning light is activated. 

In order to guarantee the SCR catalytic converter over a long period there is a long-term adaptation 

in which the metered amount is adjusted to the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ). In order to undertake 
the adaptation the signal of the NO x sensor after the SCR catalytic converter is compared with a 
calculated value. If deviations occur here then the metering amount is adjusted in the short-term. The 
systematics of the adaptations is evaluated and a correction factor is applied to the metering amount. 

The operating range for the long-term adaptation is the same as for the effectiveness monitoring. 

If the correction factor exceeds a certain threshold a reversible fault is created. If the fault is determined 
in three consecutive driving cycles then an irreversible fault is stored and the emissions warning light is 
activated. 


3.7.2. Supply of urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) 

The supply of urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is necessary for a problem-free operation of the SCR 
catalytic converter. 

After the SCR catalytic converter reaches a certain temperature (calculated by the exhaust-gas 
temperature sensor in front of the SCR catalytic converter, amongst other things) the metering control 
tries a pressure build-up in the metering line. For this the metering module must be closed and the 
supply pump must be activated with a certain number of pump strokes for a certain amount of time. 

If the pressure threshold cannot be reached within a certain amount of time then the metering module 
injector is opened in order to bleed the metering line. Subsequently a renewed pressure build-up is 
attempted. 

If a set number of pressure build-up attempts take place unsuccessfully then a reversible fault is 
created. If the fault is determined in two consecutive driving cycles then an irreversible fault is stored 
and the emissions warning light is activated. 


48 




SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


This monitoring only runs once per driving cycle before the metering begins. If this 
monitoring is "passed" then the continuous pressure monitoring begins. 

For the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) a constant pressure of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) 
is necessary (6 bar). The actual pressure and the resulting pressure module are determined and 
monitored by the SCR dosing control unit (DCU) using an available parameter. The available parameter 
is the power consumption in a defined period of the supply pump in the SCR delivery module. 

The following values are checked: 

• High pressure 

• Vacuum 

• Implausible pressure readings 

If these limits are exceeded for a certain amount of time a reversible fault is created. If the fault is 
determined in three consecutive driving cycles then an irreversible fault is stored and the emissions 
warning light is activated, the pressure in the SCR system is reduced fully and the SCR system shut 
down. 

This monitoring takes place in active metering. 

3.7.3. Level measurement of active tank 

A level sensor with ultrasonic technology is used for the active tank. The plausibility of the sensor 
takes place in the evaluation unit in which it is checked if the signals are logical. 

The Level/Temperature Sensor has new faults compared to the previous system. The "no echo error" 
fault is set if no valid echo can be detected on a certain distance of driving. This could happen if 
something blocks the sensor signal or the tank is overfilled and the echo from the tank wall doesn't hit 
the sensor. 

Slosh plausibility: After breaking a certain amount of slosh (moving signal) is expected. 


3.7.4. Suitable urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) 

The SCR system is monitored for wrong medium in terms of refilling. This monitoring begins when 
refilling is identified. The refilling identification is described in the previous SCR system training 
material. 

In order to recognize a wrong medium the monitoring of the effectiveness of the SCR catalytic 
converter is used. A wrong medium is identified if the effectiveness falls below a certain value within 
a set time after an identified refilling event. In this case a reversible fault is created. If the fault is 
determined in two consecutive driving cycles then an irreversible fault is stored and the emissions 
warning light is activated. 

3.7.5. NO x sensors 

For the operation and therefore also the monitoring of the NO x sensor a so-called dew point must 
be reached. This ensures that no more water is in the exhaust that could otherwise damage the NO x 
sensors. 


49 



SCR 2 (US) 

3. Functions 


If a fault is identified by the following monitoring of the NO x sensor then; A reversible fault is created. 

If the fault is determined in three consecutive driving cycles then an irreversible fault is stored and the 
emissions warning light is activated. 

The following faults are identified: 

• Identification signal or correction factor is wrong 

• Interrupted or short circuit between measuring probe and control unit of the NO x sensor 

• Measured value outside of the defined area for a certain time 

• Operating temperature is not reached after a defined heating period 

• In coasting (overrun) mode (no nitrogen oxide expected) too great a distance from the 
measured value to zero is identified 

• In the transfer from the load in coasting (overrun) mode the signal of the NO x sensor does not 
fall from 80% to 50% quickly enough (only NO x sensor before the SCR catalytic converter) 

• If, despite a spike in the signal of the NO x sensor before the SCR catalytic converter there 
is not at least one defined change in the signal of the NO x sensor after the SCR catalytic 
converter, then this counts as implausible. 

3.7.6. Display and driver information 

The SCR dosing control unit (DCU) delivers the combined data from the level sensor in the active tank 
and passive tank, if installed, to the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE), which makes the data accessible 
to other bus users via the PT-CAN and central gateway module (ZGM) or the Body Domain Controller 
(BDC).

SCR 2 (US) 

4. System Components 

4.1. Components of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) 

4.1.1. Urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) 

The diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is a urea-water solution which acts as a the carrier for the ammonia 
that is used to reduce the nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the exhaust gas. In order to protect people and the 
environment against ammonia and in order to make it more manageable for transportation and tank 
processes it is available in a liquid urea form for use in the SCR system. 

The recommended urea/water mixture is AdBlue . The naming rights of AdBlue are owned by VDA 

(German Association of the Automotive Industry). AdBlue is a high-purity, water-clear, synthetically 
manufactured solution consisting of 32.5% urea with the balance (67.5%) being water. The urea-water 
solution used must correspond to this standard. 

The recommended urea-water solution must meet certain standards for quality which are set forth in 
accordance with the DIN 70070/AUS32. 


AdBlue® 


AdBlue® trademark 


(r) 

The urea/water mixture used (AdBlue ) must in any case be of this standard. 

Hazard and health 

The urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is not poisonous. It is an aqueous solution which poses no special 
risks. It is not a hazardous substance and it is not a dangerous medium which is readily apparent after 
reviewing the Material Safety Data (MSDS) sheets. 

The urea-water solution is not toxic. If small amounts of the product come in contact with the skin 
while handling the urea-water solution it is sufficient to simply rinse it off with ample water. In this way, 
the possibility of any ill effects on human health are ruled out. 

The urea-water solution can be broken down by microbes and is therefore easily degradable. The 
urea-water solution poses a minimum risk to water and soil. Refer to local laws regarding handling and 
disposal requirements. 

If, when handling the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®), traces of the product come into contact with 
the skin, it is sufficient to wash it off with lots of water. An impairment of human health in this way is 
practically impossible. 


51 



SCR 2 (US) 

4. System Components 

Decomposability and disposal 

The urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) can be used by microbes and is therefore very easily 

decomposable. From the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) there is a very small danger for water and soil. 

® 

In Germany the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is in the lowest water danger class (WGK 1). Thanks 

® 

to its outstanding decomposability, small amounts of spilled urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) can be 
washed into the sewage system with lots of water without any problems. 

Storage and durability 

In order to prevent quality impairments due to impurities and a high inspection effort the urea/water 
mixture (AdBlue®) can only be stored in designated storage and container systems. 

® 

As the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) becomes solid at -11 °C/12.2 °F (frozen) and decomposes more 
quickly at temperatures above 25 °C (77 °F) storage and container systems are to be setup in such a 
way that a temperature range of 30 °C to -11 °C (86 °F to 12.2 °F) can be guaranteed. 

If the recommended storage temperature of maximum 25 °C (77 °F) is kept then the urea/water 

mixture (AdBlue®) fulfills the requirements of the DIN 70070 standard for at least 12 months after 
its manufacture. If its recommended storage temperature is exceeded then this period is reduced. If 

the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) cools to under -11 °C (12.2 °F) it becomes solid. Upon heating the 

frozen urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) becomes liquid again and can be used again as normal without 
any loss of quality. 

The urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is normally odorless. If an unpleasant odor (strong smell of 
ammonia) occurs then this suggests old medium. 

Direct ultraviolet radiation is to be avoided. 

Material tolerance 

The contact of urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) with copper and zinc as well as their alloys and aluminium 
is to be urgently avoided as it leads to corrosion. Stainless steels and most plastics are no problem 
whatsoever.

The name passive tank means that it is not heated. 

The following components belong to the passive tank: 

• Tank flange with level sensor and temperature sensor 

• Filling port 

• Service vent line, fluid filler neck breather 

Depending on the series, it is possible that the passive tank is insulated. The insulation comprises 
foam material and prevents quick freezing at low temperatures. As its installation location may also be 
near the exhaust system depending on the vehicle, it would also lead to a high introduction of heat to 

the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ). 

If there are very low temperatures over a long period of time there is a possibility that the urea/water 

mixture (AdBlue ) might completely freeze in the passive tank. No transfer pumping can then take 
place. In this case the active tank must be refilled more often. 

The passive tank cannot be filled separately as it is filled via the active tank. 

The F30 has only one filling position. The DEF will flow to the active tank until this is full. 

Then the liquid will rise in the filler pipe and the passive tank will be filled. 

FI 5 has a separate filler pipe for the passive tank.

Note: The F10 and the F02 do not use a passive tank in the US market.

The tank flange of the passive tank cannot be replaced separately in Service as it is welded to the

Temperature sensor 

The temperature sensor is integrated in the tank flange and cannot be replaced separately. The 
temperature sensor integrated in the tank flange is installed in the active tank and the passive tank. 

The fuel level sensor is connected via a 3-pin plug connection. A temperature sensor is integrated 
as part of the fill level sensor. A temperature-dependent electrical resistor is used for temperature 
sensing. The circuit contains a voltage divider where the resistance can be measured depending on 
the temperature. A temperature is converted using a characteristic curve specific to the sensor. The 
measuring range is from -40 °C to 80 °C (-40 °F to 176 °F). 

Ventilation 

The passive tank has a service vent line and a fluid filler neck breather. 

The service vent line and fluid filler neck breather lead to the filling pipe for the urea/water mixture 
(AdBlue®) at the fluid filler cap.

4.1.3. Transfer pump unit 

The transfer pump unit assumes the delivery of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) from the passive

4.1.4. Active tank 

The active tank is so-called because it is heated. 

The following components belong to the active tank: 

• Level sensor 

• Temperature sensor 

• Service vent line, fluid filler neck breather 

• Tank flange module with SCR delivery module and heating. 

Depending on the series, it is possible that the active tank is insulated. The insulation comprises foam 
material and prevents quick freezing at low temperatures. As its installation location may also be near 
the exhaust system depending on the vehicle, it would also lead to a high introduction of heat to the 

urea/water mixture (AdBlue ).

Carrier plate 


An electric auxiliary heater (positive temperature coefficient) is located in the tank flange module, 

so that at minimum temperatures liquid urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is available for the journey. 

The positive temperature coefficient elements can be regulated or switched off independently upon 
reaching a certain limit temperature. Intrinsic safety is thus guaranteed which prevents damage and 
destruction in the event of a fault with the continuous power supply. 

The heating element in the tank flange module is supplied with electricity by a power semiconductor. 
The power semiconductor is controlled by the SCR dosing control unit (DCU). The SCR dosing control 
unit (DCU) can give out the electricity that flows via the heating elements and therefore monitor their 
function. 


59 


















SCR 2 (US) 

4. System Components 

The temperature sensor delivers the signal for the control of the heating. It is an NTC sensor (negative 
temperature coefficient). The temperature sensor is integrated in the level sensor. 

The level sensor in the tank flange module delivers the value of the level for the entire active tank. 

The level sensor in the active tank works according to the same principle as the level sensor in the 
passive tank. 

4.1.5. SCR delivery module 

The SCR delivery module is integrated in the tank flange module (bolted on), which is located below at 
the active tank. 

The SCR delivery module contains a supply pump and a return pump, maintenance-free filter, a 
Restrictor and two intake valves and two fluid pressure control valves for the supply pump and the 
return pump. 

The delivery pump sends the AdBlue to the SCR metering module. The delivery pump operates at 
a system pressure of between 4.5 and 8.5 bar. The return pump drains the pressure line. Partial 
draining of the pressure line is needed to avoid ice damaging the SCR metering module in freezing 
conditions. Although this is kept to a minimum due to acoustic reasons related to the refilling of the 
metering line. 

In addition, the ice pressure dampers are housed in the supply lines (supply and return) for the active 
tank. These prevent damage to the SCR delivery module and its supply pump and return pump in the 

event of frozen and therefore enlarging urea/water mixture (AdBlue®). 

A pulsation damper and a strainer at the output for the metering line are also integrated in the SCR 
delivery module and prevent excessive pulsations in the metering line when the metering valve is open 
and penetration of dirt particles in the SCR delivery module (e.g. combustion residue, which could 

enter the SCR delivery module upon return of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) via the open metering 
valve. 

The SCR delivery module also contains a heating element. The SCR delivery module heating 
comprises the copper conductor of the coils from supply pump and return pump. 

The SCR delivery module can be replaced individually in Service.

The metering line is a 4 x 1 pipe, i.e. a pipe with an outer diameter of 4 mm and an inner diameter of 

2 mm with a wall thickness of 1 mm in which the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) is transported to the 
delivery module. 

The heating element (in the form of ohmic heating wires) is attached from the outside 
to this 4x1 pipe, insulated and then physically protected by a corrugated plastic coating.

The metering module ensures the injection of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) into the exhaust pipe. 
It includes a solenoid valve that is similar to the fuel injector of a gasoline engine. 

The metering module is not heated, but is heated up by the exhaust system therefore it has to be 
cooled using coolant from the engine cooling system. 


63 
















SCR 2 (US) 

4. System Components 

The metering module is activated by a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) signal from the SCR dosing 
control unit (DCU) in which the duty cycle determines the opening duration of the valve.

A cone-shaped insert is attached at the metering module. This prevents the residue of the urea/water 
mixture (AdBlue ) drying up and the valve clogging. The shape creates a flow that prevents the urea/ 

water mixture (AdBlue ) from sticking to the walls of the exhaust system. Deposits of urea on the 
insert are burnt off as it is heated by the exhaust flow. 

Mixer 

The mixer is located directly behind the metering module in the exhaust system. It is inserted in the 
flange joint of the exhaust pipe. It swirls the exhaust flow in order to achieve a better mix of the urea/ 

water mixture (AdBlue®) and the exhaust gas. This is necessary so that the urea is fully transformed 
into ammonia. The mixer can be replaced individually in Service.

4.1.8. Urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) fluid filler cap 

The urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) fluid filler cap includes ventilation. This ventilation is necessary 
as both the filling of the SCR system and the ventilation are realized via a common fluid filler neck 
breather pipe and tank ventilation line. 

The ventilation is achieved via a defined hole in the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) fluid filler cap. 
Therefore, only fluid filler caps which are approved for the respective vehicle are used. 

A replacement or use of other fluid filler caps may cause a malfunction of the SCR system.

4.1.9. SCR dosing control unit (DCU) 

The SCR dosing control unit (DCU) must ensure that the input variables for the metering specification 
of the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE) are in the permissible range. The fluid levels of the urea/water 

mixture (AdBlue®) passive tank (no vehicle operation without reducer), the medium temperatures 

in the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) passive tank and the metering line (AdBlue , freezing point at 
-11 °C/12.2 °F) and the pressure build-up metering line (ensures fluid injection rate) are relevant here. 

The SCR dosing control unit (DCU) ensures that all available information is also available for other 
applications, for example the fluid level indicator and the remaining range (999 mis and 199 mis) 
display warning in the central information display (CID).

4.2. NO x sensors 



N0 X sensor 


As with the previous SCR system SCR 2 also incorporates two NOx sensors (one upstream and one 
downstream of the SCR catalyst) The nitrogen oxide sensor consists of the actual measuring probe 
and its own corresponding control unit. The control unit communicates via the Lo-CAN with the 
Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE). In terms of its operating principle, the nitrogen oxide sensor can be 
compared with a broadband oxygen sensor. The measuring principle is based on the idea of basing the 
nitrogen oxide measurement on oxygen measurement. 

The operating principle of this measurement procedure is shown in the graphic on the following page.

Functional description: The sensor system of the nitrogen oxide sensor consists of a solid electrolyte 
made of ceramic based on zirconium dioxide. Above a temperature of approximately 300 °C (572 
°F), this material becomes conductive for oxygen ions. The internal heating element provides for the 
necessary operating temperature. The mixture of 0 2 and nitrogen oxide in the exhaust gas reaches 
the nitrogen oxide sensor after the nitrogen oxide catalyst storage. The nitrogen oxide sensor consists 
of two chambers. A pump cell regulates the oxygen concentration to a specific value by pumping 
oxygen out of or into the first chamber. Through the application of a voltage, the oxygen molecules 
are split into ions and diverted through the solid electrolyte. The remaining nitrogen oxide then goes 
onto the second chamber. The oxygen concentration is then further reduced with a second pump cell 


68 






























SCR 2 (US) 

4. System Components 

in the second chamber. The remaining nitrogen oxide is split into oxygen and nitrogen at a catalytic 
element at the third pump cell. The released oxygen leads to a pump current which is proportional to 
the concentration of nitrogen oxide in the exhaust gas. The evaluation electronics generate the output 
signals based on the physical measured values. The control unit communicates via the Lo-CAN with 
the Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE).

5.1. Refilling 

The SCR system is generally maintenance-free. The service requirements are solely limited to refilling 
the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ). 


The refilling of active and passive tanks with urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) can either be carried out in 
Service or by the customer themselves. 

Refilling on an incline of up to 5° in any direction is no problem. 90% of the maximum possible refilling 
is still achieved. 

® 

The volume of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) tank is set out in such a way that a large range is 
possible. This means that the "normal" refilling takes place in a relatively long cycle so that the refilling 
can ideally take place in a second Service. 

Should the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) reserve not last until the next workshop visit a certain amount 
can also be refilled. A special bottle can be used for this that is screwed onto the fluid filler neck. The 
special bottle, also known as the “KRUSE bottle”, guarantees filling without the danger of overfilling, 
overflowing or spraying in the engine compartment or on the paint surface. 

® 

Refilling using the KRUSE bottle is also possible via the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) filler connection 
in the fuel filler flap as this bottle also runs dry at an angle of about 30°. 

KRUSE refill bottles with a content of 0.5 US gallons can be ordered from the Electronic Parts Catalog 
(the current part numbers are set out in the Electronic Parts Catalog ).

Special KRUSE bottles for urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) 

Should the starting of the engine already be prevented by the switch off scenario (inducement with "no 
start in —two bottles should be used to stop the switch off scenario from occurring again straight 
away. 

A 

In the case of a inducement with "no start in —" a minimum of 2 bottles (approx. 4 Liters) is 
required to get a refill detection and reset the countdown. At the beginning of the inducement 
(999 mis left) one bottle is enough to get a refill detection. 


5.2. Refilling in Service 

For refilling in Service 10 liter canisters are available, which are used in conjunction with a special tool 
(the current special tool part numbers are set out in the Aftersales Assistance Portal). 

The filling hose that was used for SCR 1 is still usable for SCR 2. (This filling hose (next picture) is 
sold at Daimler in Europe) VERIFY use in US 


71

Once the system is fully drained two canisters are required. Via the workshop system ISTA it can be 
checked whether both tanks, active tank and passive tank, were filled completely. 

Refill canisters with a content of 10 liters can be ordered from the Electronic Parts Catalog (the current 
part numbers are set out in the Electronic Parts Catalog ).

A_ 

Never refill the system from the canister without the special tools! Damage to components 
may occur due to overfilling and spillage (especially in the engine compartment) where 
various materials are very sensitive to the corrosive properties of the urea/water mixture 

AdBlue®). 


® 

5.3. Checking the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) concentrate 

The quality check of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) is performed using a refractometer, which 
determines the urea concentration (the current special tool part numbers are set out in the Aftersales 
Assistance Portal). Using the enclosed pipette a drop of the medium to be tested is placed on the 
prism and the lid closed. The values are shown on the relevant scale using the light/dark boundary in 
the eyepiece.

Evaluation of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) concentrate: 


At values lower than 31.8 percent by weight, proper functioning of the urea/water mixture 
(AdBlue®) can no longer be guaranteed. Therefore, this must be replaced (for example, urea/ 
water mixture (AdBlue®) aged by UV irradiation). 

The values are within the tolerance for values displayed between 31.8 and 33.3 percent in 
weight. 

Values higher than 33.3 percent in weight indicate a leak in the SCR system (for example if a 
proportion of water in the urea/water mixture (AdBlue®) has evaporated).

(r) 

Urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) which has been drawn off cannot be reused without a check. Long 
storage times and the influence of high temperatures and UV light have a subtle effect on the 

decomposition of the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ). 


® 

5.4. Evacuating the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) 

If it is necessary to draw off the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) within the framework of maintenance 
measures or repair measures or in the case of a excessive ageing, this must be done using suitable 

tools. It is not possible to drain the system as draining ports are not provided. 

A 

It is not possible to drain the system!!! 

The new systems do not have a draining provision as E70. In order to drain the new system it 
is necessary to remove the filler pipe an drain through the filler nipple on the active tank. The 
passive tank can be drained through the transfer connection. 


A_ 

The drained urea/water mixture (AdBlue @ ) must be collected in a suitable plastic tank. The 
pump must be purged with water after each use and cleaned. 

The safety data sheet must be observed for handling and disposal. 


5.5. Urea/water mixture (AdBlue ) — Compatibility with other 
materials 

Components of the SCR system are incompatible with materials with a mineral oil base. It therefore 
must be assured that the components of the SCR system do not come into contact with these. In 
the event of uncertainties whether SCR system components came into contact with materials with a 
mineral oil base or SCR system components were filled with materials with a mineral oil base, there are 
test strips available to check the rest of the materials with a mineral oil base in the urea/water mixture 

(AdBlue®). 

A 

In the event that these materials have been verified and components of the SCR system were 
damaged as a result, the SCR system must be completely replaced. 


74 










SCR 2 (US) 

5. Information for Service 

A _ _ 

Special tools and other tools used in Service must be kept far away from materials containing a mineral 
oil base when handling the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ). This applies, in particular, for special tools 
and tools which are used for filling and draining the urea/water mixture (AdBlue ).
