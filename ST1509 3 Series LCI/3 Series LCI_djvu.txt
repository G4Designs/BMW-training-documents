3.2.2. Engine speed adaptation for a gear change 

During a gear change the engine speed is automatically adapted to the new transmission ratio. The 
engine and the transmission input shaft have the same speed when engaging the clutch. This ensures 
the clutch is always engaged smoothly.

3.2.3. Gear sensor 

In the 3 series LCI manual transmission a gear sensor is used, which detects the correct position of the 
individual gears as well as the neutral position. This information is transmitted to the DME . 

A mechanical reverse gear switch is no longer required. 

There is a magnetic clip secured on the gearshift shaft. The alignment of the magnetic field lines of the 
magnetic clip are evaluated by the gear sensor, which is screwed to the transmission housing from the 
outside. 

The ‘3D magnetic field sensor system” is integrated in the gear sensor. This type of gear sensor 
measures magnetic fields which are aligned parallel to the chip surface. This ensures that every gear 
shift and engaged gear is recognized. 

The sensor is capable of self-diagnosis and can input a fault in the system.

3 Series LCI 

3. Powertrain 


The information from the neutral sensor is also used for the MSA function as well as the shift point 
indicator, and engine speed adaptation during a gear change. 

The corresponding engine speed is calculated by the DME and held for a maximum of 2 seconds. 
The engine speed is adapted in varying degrees depending on the driving mode selected. 

For the control the clutch pedal must be fully pressed when shifting. 

The engine speed adaptation for the gear change is not active: 

• When the DCS is switched off 

• At driving speeds < 12 mph 

• When switching to 1st gear 

The engine speed adaptation can be permanently deactivated by the diagnosis system. 

After replacement of the sensor it must be calibrated with the BMW diagnosis system. 


3.3. Automatic transmission 

The new GA8HP50Z automatic transmission is used in the BMW 3 Series LCI with the new engine 
generation (B58). This is a further development of the already established automatic transmission 
GA8HP45Z used with the N20 and N26 engines.. 

It is characterized above all by improved efficiency as well as enhanced driving and shifting comfort. 
These improvements have been achieved by the following measures, to name a few: 

• Greater spread thanks to two changed gear sets 

• Mechanical disc separation by undulated expander springs in brakes A and B in the not 
actuated state 

• Additional spring assembly for the opening of brake B.

3.3.1. Emergency release 

The mechanical transmission emergency release has also been modified. For this purpose the parking 
lock lever must be secured using a new special tool (order number 83 30 2 355 850) in the position 
pictured below.

3.3.2. ConnectedShift 

ConnectedShift uses navigation data for a forward-thinking shift strategy of the automatic 
transmission. If, for example, a sharp curve is detected ahead, the automatic transmission shifts 
down early and the gear is retained in the bend. 

The route guidance of the navigation system does not need to be activated for the function. However, 
the identification of a turn-off request, for example by the active route guidance or operation of the turn 
indicator, helps to control the system more accurately. Up-to-date navigation map data also influences 
the control accuracy. 

More information on ConnectedShift can be found in the Training Reference Manual ST1312 "FI 5 
Complete Vehicle".

• Active Driving Assistant (SA 5AS) 

Lane departure warning 

Pedestrian warning with city braking function 
Collision warning with city braking function. 

• Parking Assistant (OE 5DP) 

• Park Distance Control front and rear (OE 508) 

• Surround View (option 5DL) 

• High-beam assistant (OE 5AC) 

• ACC Stop&Go (SA 5DF) 

• Active blind spot detection (option 5AG) 

• Speed limit info (OE 8TH) 

• Dynamic Cruise Control with braking function (OE 544) 

4.4.2. Lane change warning 

Thanks to new radar sensors, vehicles can now be detected at speeds of 30 km/h /18 mph and above. 

4.4.3. Parking assistant 

The first generation of the Parking Assistant (PMA) (OE 5DP) could only park parallel to the roadway 
between two vehicles (parallel parking), the second generation of PMA can also park perpendicularly 
(cross parking) to the roadway. 

Furthermore, it is no longer necessary for the parking space to be confined by two vehicles. With the 
second generation of the system, it is also possible to park behind only one object.

3 Series LCI Parking Manoeuvring Assistant functions 


In order to register a parking space perpendicular to the roadway, the 3 Series LCI needs two 
additional ultrasonic sensors. These ultrasonic sensors are built into the rear bumper on the left and 
right sides.

Ultrasonic sensors in rear bumper, side (PDC sensors) 

2 

Ultrasonic sensors in rear bumper (PDC sensors) 


The acoustic warning of the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) is only issued if the detected object 
lies in the vehicle's path and poses a risk of collision. A continuous alarm is output once the object is 
closer than 25 cm away. 

More information on the new generation of the Parking Assistant (PMA) can be found in the Training 
Reference Manual ST 1502 "F23 Complete Vehicle". 

4.4.4. Park Distance Control 

Auto PDC 

The visual and acoustic warning of obstacles has been optimized in the BMW 3 Series LCI. Park 
Distance Control (PDC) cuts in with the Auto PDC function automatically, even when the vehicle is 
driving forwards. 

More information on the Auto PDC function is available in the Training Reference Manual ST 1502 
“F23 Complete Vehicle". 

Side protection 

With the side protection, it is now possible to monitor the entire side of the vehicle rather than just the 
front side and rear side. 

The side protection is not a separate optional equipment package, but is included in the 3 Series LCI 
if the vehicle has the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) (OE 5DP) and a Professional navigation 
system (OE 609) installed. 

The side ultrasonic sensors of the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant are used to provide the side 
protection function. 


19 





3 Series LCI 

4. General Vehicle Electronics 



Operating principle of 3 Series LCI side protection 


The side protection is activated using the PDC button. The side protection is also enabled any time 
that Auto PDC is activated. Once enabled, the side protection operates up to a speed of 10 km/h / 6 
mph. 

The measuring range around the B-pillar and parts of the doors is not monitored by the ultrasonic 
sensors. Instead this area is imaged using a computer model while the vehicle drives past. 

The side protection is not active during an automatic parking manoeuvre by the Parking Manoeuvring 
Assistant (PMA). 

An acoustic warning is only issued if the detected obstacle is lying in the path of the vehicle. 

A continuous alarm is output once the obstacle is closer than 25 cm away.

Long Term Evolution (LTE) 

Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a 4th generation (4G) mobile radio standard. LTE can achieve a 
significantly higher download rate with up to 100 MBit/s. The basic diagram of UMTS is retained for 
LTE. A quick and reasonable changeover of the infrastructures of the UMTS technology (3G standard) 
to LTE Advanced (4G standard) is therefore possible. 

The frequency ranges used differ depending on the region, and vary from about 700 to 2600 MHz. 

The term "Frequency Division Duplex" is understood as transmission and receiving from cell and 
base stations on tow different frequency bands: The mobile device transmits, in the Uplink channel, 
while the base station transmits, in the Downlink channel. Each of the two frequency ranges have a 
bandwidth of 5 MHz. Expressed simply, this means that 2 transmitters and 2 receivers in each case 
transmit and receive simultaneously with 2 different frequencies. 

With MIMO technology (Multiple Input Multiple Output), it is possible for mobile radio providers to 
offer data speeds with a low error rate. MIMO is the basis for a special encoding procedure which uses 
both temporal and also spatial dimensions for information transfer (Space-Time Coding). 

As a result, the quality (bit error frequency) and data rate of a wireless connection can be improved 
significantly. MIMO systems can transmit considerably more Bit/s per Hz bandwidth used, and are thus 
more efficient than conventional systems. In order to realise the MIMO technology at BMW bothdata 
antennas present in the vehicle area used simultaneously for the first time for the LTE connection. 
MIMO operates similar to the antenna diversity in the radio system. The signal of both antennas is 
sent, evaluated and combined to minimize errors and optimize data speed.

LTE requires two transceiver aerials for the faster data transfer (MIMO principle). Vehicles with a TCB2 
in the luggage compartment use the emergency GSM aerial next to the telematics aerial as the second 
LTE aerial. As the emergency GSM aerial in the F30 LCI is a fixed component of the TCB2, all the 
aerials needed for LTE reception are built into the roof-mounted aerial. 

UMTS reception (3G) is standard equipment in the 3 Series LCI. The 3 Series LCI is only equipped 
with LTE reception (4G) in vehicles with the optional equipment convenient telephone with extended 
smartphone connection (OE 6NS).
