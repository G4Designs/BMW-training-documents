TECHNICAL CONCEPT - BATTERY PACK. 




Concept identical for PHEV / EV application 

■ Distributed E/E design (BMU, S-Box, CSC) 

■ Structural rigidity by overall mechanical design 

■ Light-weight housing (aluminum extruded/diecast) 

■ Direct refrigeration (single/multi-layer) 

■ All components serviceable, easy access, 

(high voltage is protected against contact within 
battery housing)

TECHNICAL CONCEPT-E/E. 


CSC CSC CSC CSC 



■ Modular kit HW: same electronic components in both systems 

■ Modular kit SW: same software and algorithms in both systems, diversity by calibration 

■ BMU (Battery Management Unit), S-Box (Switch Box) and CSC(Cell Supervising Circuit) 

■ BMU contains battery management software (e.g. SOC,SOH, diagnosis) 

■ CSC for cell voltage/temperature measurement 

■ S-Box: fuse, contactors, current and voltage measurement

TECHNICAL CONCEPT - CELL MODULE. 



EV cell module (12 cells) 



PHEV1 cell module (16 cells) 


■ Cell number per module (12v.s. 16): trade-off between package, electronic 
components and transport regulations 

■ Cell module is a serviceable unit 

■ Validation on module level guarantees high quality and reduced costs for derivates 

■ Meeting UN38.3 standard 

■ Possibility to use EV and PHEV1 modules for further projects

■ Cell Lifetime 

Cooling performance is key factor for lifetime 

■ Weight & performance 

Highest cooling performance at minimum weight 
and costs (no extra installation in vehicle, use of 
existing A/C system) 

■ Heating option 

Available for maximum comfort and performance 
without losing range 

■ Complexity of direct cooling 

Intensive validation and simulation is necessary for 
complex designs (multi-layer)
