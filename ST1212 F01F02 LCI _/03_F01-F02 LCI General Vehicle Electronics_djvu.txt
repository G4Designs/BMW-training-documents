As part of the model revision of the F01/F02 some adaptations were made to the vehicle electrical sys¬ 
tem. Similar to the other current BMW models, the F01/F02 LCI central information display (CID) now 
is connected to the APIX line and thus has no bus connection. For vehicles with a rear seat entertain¬ 
ment system this is the first time the two rear monitors are also connected to the APIX line instead of a 
bus connection. 

The F01/F02 LCI vehicle electrical system has been enhanced with the addition of the K-CAN3 bus 
system. This is used for the realization of the illumination functions, among other things. More infor¬ 
mation on this bus system can be found in the "Exterior Lights" chapter in this training manual.

2. Electrical System 

The US version F01/F02 LCI is available with “Navigation Professional” Headunit High as standard 
equipment. The Headunit High telematics functions are made available by the new Telematic Commu¬ 
nication Box (TCB) control unit. The other “media” functions, which were previously provided by the 
Combox, are now directly integrated into the Headunit High. More information on these two control 
units can be found in the ST1211 Headunit High training material available on TIS and ICR 

2.1.1. Reversible electromotive automatic reel (REMA LI and REMA RE) 

Reversible electromotive automatic reels have been introduced to the US market (for the first time) in 
the F01/F02 LCI vehicles as part of the standard Active Protection (5AL) system. The REMA RE and 
REMA LI control units are installed on both front seat belts and are an essential component of the new 
Pre-Crash/Post-Crash functions of the Active Protection system. 

After fastening the seat belt the reversible electromotive reel reduces the belt slack as soon as the 
driver drives off past 10 km/h (6 mph). Removing the belt slack guarantees that the seat belt is secured 
to the driver or front passenger and thus a better restraining effect can be achieved in the event of an 
accident. 

Another advantage of the reversible electromotive reel is the tensioning of the belt before a possible 
accident with increased retracting force. This reduces the possibility of the passenger slipping out of 
the belt (also called "submarining"). 

For more information regarding (5AL) Active Protection system please refer to the “Passive 
Safety” section of this training material.

3. Voltage Supply 

3.1. Battery Guard 

The Battery Guard function (already known from the F30) detects critical states of charge which could 
jeopardize engine starting and sends the relevant information to the BMW Service authorized work¬ 
shop which in turn contacts the customer to schedule a service visit. 

BMW Assist with enhanced Bluetooth and USB (option 6NL) and an active BMW ConnectedDrive 
agreement are required for the Battery Guard function which are standard in all F01/F02 LCI vehicles. 

The BMW TeleServices Battery Guard Call is automatically activated by the vehicle under the following 
conditions: 

• If the battery voltage reaches the bottom of the starting ability limit because a bus wake-up 
signal is present, sleep mode is prevented or there is a standby current violation the BMW 
TeleServices Battery Guard informs the BMW Service authorized workshop in defined cases 
at the next vehicle start-up (terminal 15 ACTIVE). It can then proactively contact the customer 
and arrange a service appointment to eliminate the cause.

4. Comfort Access 

The Comfort Access function is integrated in the Car Access System (CAS) control unit in the F01/F02 
LCI. 

Comfort Access contains the following functions: 

• Passive Entry (access authorization) 

facilitates access to the vehicle without active use of the ID transmitter 

• Passive Go (drive authorization) 

enables the vehicle to be started when there is a valid ID transmitter in the passenger com¬ 
partment 

• Passive Exit (locking authorization) 

enables the vehicle to be locked without active use of the ID transmitter 

• Convenience trunk opening 

makes possible hands free opening of the trunk lid by simply moving a foot under the rear 
bumper. 

The components and functionality of Comfort Access are familiar from the current BMW models.

4. Comfort Access 


The two sensors are connected to the evaluation electronics and constantly measure the capacitance. 
A comparison of the time characteristic of the measured capacities permits the identification of a cer¬ 
tain movement pattern. 

A targeted foot movement to and from the bumper is detected as the top sensor detects the shin, the 
bottom sensor the toes. 

The detection range is between the rear lights and is highlighted by a chrome trim strip on the rear 
bumper. 

The sensors are secured in the inside of the rear bumper. 

The evaluation electronics evaluate the signals from the sensors and make this information available 
to the footwell module and the junction box electronics via the local interconnect network (LIN) bus. 

If a valid ID transmitter is located in the vicinity of the Comfort Access antenna in the rear bumper, the 
junction box electronics activates the opening of the trunk lid. 

The trunk opens regardless if it was locked or unlocked.

5. Exterior Lights 


The exterior lights are adapted to market requirements and utilize the latest technology accordingly. 
The F01 already impressive available options have been enhanced and supplemented with new fea¬ 
tures.

3 

LED fog light (standard) 


The additional turn indicators of the front fenders have been discontinued and are now integrated into 
the exterior mirrors. 

The design of the bi-xenon headlight has been modified. The side lights and the daytime driving lights 
are now realized by LEDs. The LEDs can be operated in two power stages. If they are activated at full 
power, they are daytime driving lights. The side lights roughly 10 % of their power is dimmed. 

The standard bi-xenon Adaptive Headlight have a new design. 

The exterior lights are supplemented with the LED fog lights as standard equipment (5A1) and the 
new adaptive LED headlights (optional equipment 552 on all models but the 760Li). 

The new adaptive LED headlights are unique and are primarily distinguished from the LED headlights 
of other BMW models by their appearance. 

In the F01/F02 LCI (for the first time) the low-beam headlight and the daytime driving lights are both 
realized via LED arrays. The LED arrays replace the previous corona ring design. This results in a typi¬ 
cal and unmistakable appearance of the vehicle which is noticeable during the day and at night. 

The activation of the new bi-xenon headlights with Adaptive Headlight (standard) or the new adaptive 
LED headlights (optional equipment 552) is realized for the first time using an additional quick body 
Controller Area Network bus (K-CAN3). In this bus topology the standard LIN bus is still used for the 
activation of the stepper motors in the headlights and for the transmission of the reduced fault and di- 


12

5. Exterior Lights 

agnosis information to the stepper motors. In contrast to the previous activation, the footwell module 
no longer addresses individual light sources, but conveys lighting functions via the new K-CAN3 da¬ 
ta bus. This request is then implemented accordingly in the headlight control units. All headlight con¬ 
trol units are individually supplied with voltage from the junction box power distribution box or from the 
luggage compartment power distribution box. 

The high-beam assistant optional Automatic High-beams 5AC (standard on 760Li) is in conjunction 
with the LED headlight (option 552) and is offered in the ZLP Lighting Package.

F01/F02 LCI adaptive LED headlight 

The new optional equipment adaptive LED headlights (552) in the F01/F02 LCI are unique because for 
the first time both the low-beam headlight and the daytime driving lights are realized via LED arrays. 
The LED arrays replace the corona rings of the previous system and are significantly wider. The double 
rings are thus not only noticed during the day, but also at nighttime. This new feature supports the typ¬ 
ical and unmistakable appearance of the vehicle.

Low-beam headlight 



F01/F02 LCI low-beam headlight of the LED headlight 


Unlike the high-beam headlight and the LED headlights of other BMW models the F01/F02 LCI day¬ 
time driving lights and the low-beam headlight are generated from a lens projection system in the LED 
arrays.

boundary 

5 

Headlight lens 


Each headlight cluster incorporates five LED arrays with high-performance LEDs for the low-beam 
headlight and other LEDs for daytime driving lights. Each LED array generates a partial light intensity 
of the low-beam headlight. Special optics modules are located between the LED array and the head¬ 
light lens. 

The upper LED arrays are used for basic light distribution and light up over the near field to near the 
horizontal light/dark boundary. The lower LED arrays are used for long-range illumination up to the hor¬ 
izontal light/dark boundary. The two centrally arranged LED arrays have special optics modules. The 
inner LED array generates the light/dark boundary and the outer the asymmetrical range of the low- 
beam headlight. 

The light distribution for the low-beam headlight arises through the superimposition of these partial 
light ranges. 

The following graphic shows the light distribution of the LED arrays.

4 

LED array for the illumination of the asymmetrical range 


The light of the upper LED arrays is used for basic light distribution. The light illuminates the near field 
symmetrically and extends to near the light/dark boundary. The near field starts roughly 8 to 10 m (26 
to 33 ft) in front of the vehicle and extends up to roughly 20 m (65.6 ft) away. 


21 















F01/F02 LCI General Vehicle Electronics 

5. Exterior Lights 


The lower LED arrays are used for long-range lighting up to the horizontal light/dark boundary to 
roughly 60 m (197 ft) away. Their light superimposes parts in the near field and illuminates the area up 
to the horizontal light/dark boundary symmetrically. 

The horizontal light/dark boundary between the lower bright area of the road illumination and the up¬ 
per dark area arises from the superimposition with the light of the centrally arranged LED arrays of the 
inner LED arrays. 

The centrally arranged LED array of the outer LED arrays generates the asymmetrical area of the low- 
beam headlight by the noticeable fresnel optics in the headlight lens. It illuminates the outer area of 
the roadway with an increased range. 

The cornering light is always switched on dimmed to the low-beam headlight. 


Daytime driving lights 

For daytime driving lights the daytime driving lights LEDs in the LED arrays and the LEDs of the low- 
beam headlight are switched on dimmed. In addition, the positioning lights light up. The positioning 
light, together with the turn indicator, is installed in the LED headlight and can be replaced. 


High-beam headlight 



F01/F02 LCI high-beam headlight of the LED headlight 


Similar to the LED headlights of other BMW models, the high-beam headlight is generated via a reflec¬ 
tion system. In contrast to the LED headlights of other BMW models, both reflectors of the headlight 
are used for the high-beam headlight in the F01/F02 LCI.

Outer reflector for high-beam headlight (partial high-beam headlight, vertical 
light/dark boundary) 

3 

Inner reflector for high-beam headlight (flat illumination of the high-beam area) 


The high-beam headlight arises from the superimposition of two partial areas. The outer reflector gen¬ 
erates a vertical light/dark boundary, the partial high-beam headlight. The light distribution of this re¬ 
flector is restricted inwards. The inner reflector provides flat lighting for the entire high-beam area. 

Cornering light 

Similar to the LED headlights of other BMW models, the cornering light is installed as an additional 
light source in the LED headlight and can be replaced. The cornering light supports the driver when 
turning, manoeuvring and parking. In addition, the cornering light is switched on dimmed to the low- 
beam headlight. 

Side lights/Parking light and side marker light 

Unlike the LED headlights of other BMW models only the positioning lights and the side marker lights 
are switched on for the side lights. Only the positioning light is switched on for the parking light. 

The side marker light is always switched on in addition to the driving light. The LED bracket is a fixed 
component in the LED headlight and cannot be replaced. 


23

Positioning light and turn indicator 



F01/F02 LCI turn indicator 


Positioning light and turn indicator use a fiber-optic conductor, which as a positioning light is either fed 
by a white LED or as a turn indicator by a yellow LED group. 

Only if the daytime driving lights are switched on, is the positioning light switched off during indicating. 
Otherwise the white LED of the positioning light also remains switched on during indicating. 

The LED module for the turn indicator and the positioning light is installed in the LED headlight and 
can be replaced.
