Introduction 


The Z4 M Roadster will be introduced to the market as from March 2006. Although the 
basic concept and proportions are identical to those of the E85 LCI, the new Z4 M 
Roadster differs considerably, not only in terms of performance. 

For example, striking features include the precision lines of the bonnet as well as 
the front apron with large air inlets. 


Further distinguishing features include: 

• M ore distinct kidney grills. 

• 18 inch wheels with exclusive M design 

• Rear bumper cover with horizontal diffuser 

• Chrome-plated pairs of exhaust tail pipes 

• Three exclusive M exterior colors (Imola red, Sepang 
bronze metallic and Interlagos blue metallic).

1: Top speed limited electronically. 

2: BMW test results. Actual acceleration results may vary, depending on specification of vehicle, road and environmental 
conditions, testing procedures, and driving style. These results should be used for comparison only and verification should not 
be attempted on public roads. BMW urges you to obey all posted speed laws and always wear safety belts. 

3: EPA-estimated figures are for comparison purposes only. Your actual mileage will vary, depending on speed, driving habits, 
trip length, and driving conditions; actual mileage will most likely be lower.

Drivetrain 


The 3.2 liter in-line 6-cylinder engine (S54B32) is known from the E46 M3.The high¬ 
speed concept of this engine allows the Z4 M Roadsterto develop 330 bhp at 7900 
rpm. The maximum torque is 262 Ib-ft at 4900 rpm. The maximum speed is 8000 rpm. 

With this engine, the vehicle has a power-to-weight ratio of 5.6 kg/kW and accelerates from 
0 to 60 m/h in 4.9 seconds.The Z4 M Roadster's top speed is governed at 155 m/h. 

Fora sports car, the concept of a high speed engine is optimum in combination with a 
short overall gear ratio as the available engine torque can be optimally converted to 
thrust at the rear axle. 

The Z4 M Roadster is equipped with the speed-sensitive variable differential lock as 
known from the M3. 

The vehicle is equipped with a 6-speed manual gearbox with typical short shift paths is 
standard. An automatic gearbox will not be offered. 



A new engine management system, MSS70, has been specially developed forthe E85 
M Roadster. There are a few modifications compared to the MSS54 that are already 
known from the S54B32 engine of the M3 (E46). 

The changes are: 

• Alternator now controlled via a BSD interface (bit-serial data interface). 

• The sport button is now resistance coded. 

• The fuel pump is activated via the PT-CAN (separate diagnosable control unit). 

• The previous oil sensor is replaced by the oil quality sensor.

Chassis 


In line with the engine performance, the chassis of 
the Z4 M Roadster has been equipped with a sporty 
M chassis with variable differential lock. 

Together with the extremely powerful brake system 
(from the M3 CSL) as well as the 18 inch aluminium 
rims (front 225/45 ZR18, rear255/40 ZR18), the 
vehicle offers an outstanding overall concept in terms 
of driving dynamics. 

The rear axle essentially corresponds to the rear axle 
known from the M3 E46.The front axle has been 
adapted from the Z3 M Roadster. 

The steering is similarthe steering of the M3 E46.The EPS system utilized in the base 
E85 is not used. The steering system in the M Roadster is a rack and pinion design with 
power hydraulic assist (pump driven by the engine via pulley/belt). 

Run-flat tires are not available on the Z4 M Roadster. Instead the vehicle used the M tire 
mobility tire inflation kit for repairing punctures. This kit is located in the luggage com¬ 
partment.

Body/Interior Equipment 


The M sports seats as well as the M leather steering 
wheel are immediately noticeable at first glance in the 
interior. Further M-specific details include: 

• M shift knob, illuminated 

• Aluminium sill strips with M logo 

• M color design of instruments (black dial face, 
white numerals, red pointer, white permanent 
illumination) 

• Four exclusive M leather trim styles in fulled 
Napa leather. 

Some exterior M-specific details include: 

• Squarer lines on the hood: achieved by a new rolling/pressing process 
and gives the hoodline a distinctly aggressive appearance. 

• A new front bumper cover with large cooling air inlets 

• M badging on frontfenders and reartrunk lid 

• Elimination of the fog lights (not available due to air duct openings) 

• M signature 4 exhaust tailpipes

Electrical System 


A new feature of the electrical system is the position of the battery in the luggage com¬ 
partment. The battery is maintenance free (as on the M 5 E60). 

Bus Systems 

The Z4 M Roadster is equipped with the advanced crash and safety management sys¬ 
tem (ACSM)The ACSM is described in the training material for 5T503 Passive Safety 
Systems.
