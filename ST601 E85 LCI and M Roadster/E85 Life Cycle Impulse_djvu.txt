E85 Life Cycle Impulse 




Introduction 


The E85 LCI (Life Cycle Impulse) represents a redesigned E85 (Z4).This vehicle will be 
introduced to the market in M arch 2006. 

2 model variants will be available: 

• Z4 3.0i with the N52B30 UL engine, 215 bhp 

• Z4 3.0si with the N52B30 OL engine, 255 bhp 

0 n the outside, the redesigning measures are noticeable by the modified front and rear 
as well as the new light assemblies. 

0 n the inside, new upholstery colors (M ontego blue, black and saddle brown) as well as 
the higher-grade decorative trim (brushed aluminium, aluminium cirrus and dark poplar 
grain) keep in line with the new design. 

A higher-grade interiorfinish such as the rollbar and air conditioning controls are also new.

4 - Due to low-prof le tires, please note: 
Wheels, tires and suspension parts 
are more susceptible to road hazard 
and consequential damages. Z4 
models are not equipped with a spare 
tire and wheel. Performance tires are 
not recommended for driving in snow 
and ice conditions.

ation results may vary depending on 
specif cation of vehicle; road and 
environmental conditions; testing 
procedures and driving style. These 
results should be used for comparison 
only, and verif cation should not be 
attempted on public roads BMW urges 
you to obey all posted speed limits 
and to please wear your safety belt 
at all times.

Body 


The outer skin panel components of the body have been redesigned. As a result, the 
vehicle features a new front apron with black moulding and more accentuated edges. 

The mounting arrangement of the front bumper cover, however, remains the same. 
Likewise, the kidney grills have also been modified but with the same mounting arrange¬ 
ment. 



Close-up of Front 

The horizontally integrated fog lights are a new development for the LCI. 

The front headlights are completely new and integrate corona rings and white direction 
indicator lamps. 

Geometrically, the halogen headlight remains unchanged. However, on the inner of the 
front direction indicator lamps is dimmed as the marker light in the same way as the 
outer direction indicator lamp was previously used. 

The xenon headlamp has been modified.The halogen high beam light has been elimi¬ 
nated. The flash to pass feature as well as high beam illumination is the responsibility of 
the bi-xenon lamp/shutter.

E85 Life Cycle Impulse 






The headlight features a corona ring. There is a blue filter between the light source and 
the corona ring. This filter only allows blue light to pass through, thus giving the corona 
ring a similar colorto the bi-xenon headlight.

The rear bumper cover now has a second integrated lip (design). 

The tail light cluster has been modified and features a new design. There is only one rear 
fog light. 

The complete tail light cluster must be removed in orderto replace a defective bulb in the 
rear fog light. 

The area illuminated by the brake lights increases as the braking force increases (brake 
force display).

The modifications in this area are further enhanced by additional features such as larger

Drivetrain 


The E85 LCI will be available with the two new generation six cylinder engines already in 
production and use on our vehicles. The two vehicle variants are known as: 

• Z4 3.0i 215 bhp (N52B30 UL)) 

• Z4 3.Osi 255 bhp (N52B30 OL) 

With the noticeable power boost provided by all 6-cylinder engines, the performance val¬ 
ues of the E85 LCI are distinctly above those of the competition while fuel consumption 
figures remain lower. 

All E85 LCI are equipped with a 6-speed gearbox.The 3.0si and the 2.5si are optionally 
available with an automatic gearbox and gearshift paddles on the steering wheel. 

Engine Management 

The N52 engine features the familiar engine management MSV70.The N46 engine is 
equipped with the engine management M E9.

Chassis 


As its predecessor, the E85 LCI has a sporty tuned chassis.The standard run-flat tires 
have been specially developed forthe sports characteristics of the vehicle. They are now 
a little more comfortable without changing the vehicle's agility. 

Otherwise, the well-proven chassis of the Z4 has been retained. This lightweight chassis 
with single-joint spring strut front axle and central link rear axle with aluminium control 
arms still ensures safe and reliable handling as well as high cornering speeds. 

DSC and DTC as well as the 50:50 axle weight distribution are further characteristic fea¬ 
tures ofthe E85 LCI chassis.

Electrical System 

Bus Systems 


New or updated control units in the bus system include: 

• ACSM (Advanced crash and safety management) 

• M FL (M ultifunction steering wheel) 

• SES (Voice recognition system) 

• DSP-Carver =Top-HiFi 

• ULF (Universal charging and hands-free facility) 

• Controlled fuel pump (only in connection with N52 engine) 

Passive Safety System 

The E85 LCI is equipped with the advanced crash and safety management system 
(ACSM).The ACSM system is fully described in the training material ST403 Passive 
Safety Systems course.
