System Components 

Fresh Air System 



1. Intake snorkel 6. Electronic throttle (EDK) 

2. Air filter housing 7. Intake noise resonator 

3. Hot film air mass sensor (HFM) 8. Secondary air valve 

4. Intake air boot 9. Secondary air pump 

5. Suction-jet pump 


Hot Film Air Mass Sensor (HFM) 

The HFM is a compact plug in design, it is mounted directly into the clean air outlet of the 
air filter housing. This design eliminates the grille in front of the HFM. This reduces flow 
resistance in the air intake ducting, resulting in lower fuel consumption. 


Air Filter 

The intake air filter housing has a volume of approximately 13 litres.

Exhaust System 

The E60 exhaust system has been specifically developed for the M54 engine. 


1. Front pipe 

2. Middle silencer 

3. Rear silencer 



KT-11147 


Silencer 

The exhaust system is made of stainless steel and is designed as a single unit up to 
exhaust manifolds. The exhaust system consists of a middle silencer with a volume of 
litres and a rear silencer with a volume of 26.2 litres.

Note: Regarding service repairs, the middle and rear silencers can be ordered and replaced 
separately. 


Variants 

The shape of the stainless steel exhaust system is the same up to the exhaust manifolds 
for all engine (M54) and transmission variants. 


Exhaust Manifolds 

The exhaust manifolds with upstream 
catalytic converters have been used in 
previous M54 applications. 


1. Oxygen sensors (pre-catalyst) 

2. Catalytic converters 

3. Catalyst Monitoring (post) oxygen sensors 



Variants KT -11152 

Depending on the exhaust emissions leg¬ 
islation, the exhaust manifolds have different catalyst coatings (world wide).

Ancillary Components and Belt Drive 

Modifications 

The alternator is fitted with a deflection pulley. The width of the ribbed V-belt for the A/C 
compressor drive has been reduced from 5 to 4 ribs.

Alternator 

A Bosch alternator (1) with a charging current of 140 A 
is used on the M54. Due to the high alternator output, 
the alternator is fitted with a deflection pulley (2) for the 
ribbed V-belt. 

The deflection pulley is a component part of the alter¬ 
nator and ensures that the ribbed V-belt is looped to 
better effect round the alternator pulley. Refer to the 
ST045 E85 Training Handout for alternator control.

Cooling System 


Only the modifications to the cooling system of the M54 for use in the E60 are addressed. 
The cooling module is similar in design to the E65. The transmission oil cooler for the auto¬ 
matic transmission is identical to that of the E65. An engine oil cooler and viscous fan are 
not used in the E60 with M54 engine. No modifications have been made to the cooling 
system on the engine side. 

New Features 

• Coolant expansion tank with facility for draining off leakage at the expansion tank cap. 

• Lifetime coolant, routine flushing is not required. 


1. Coolant connection (upper radiator 
hose) 

2. Electric fan motor 

3. Mounting plate with thermostat 
(transmission-oil cooler) 

4. Transmission oil cooler 

5. A/C condenser 

6. Power steering cooler 

7. Cooler for active steering (AFS) 



The electric fan is mounted on the fan cowl and acts by drawing air through the radiator. 
The speed is variably regulated by the ECM. 

Note: Automatic transmission equipped E60’s with M54 have a 600 W fan. 


The coolant expansion tank is located outside the cooling module on the right hand strut 
tower. The tank is made of black plastic and incorporates a float rod with min. and max. 
markings to determine the coolant level. A float with a reed contact is located in the base 
of the tank for the low level warning. 

The cap on the expansion tank limits the pressure in the cooling system. The cap incor¬ 
porates two valves. The pressure relief valve opens from a cooling system pressure of 2 
bar. The vacuum valve opens in the event of a small vacuum pressure in the cooling 
system.

E60 Engines 











Note: The opening pressures of the cap for the coolant expansion tank differ depending on 
the type of engine used. The caps for the coolant expansion tank are engine specific and 
must not be mixed up. The value of the opening pressure is cast into the inside of the cap 
and can be read off there (e.g. 200 = 2 bar opening pressure). 

When the cap opens at a system pressure of 2 bar, it allows pressure to escape and with 
it coolant from the side. In the previous model series, the coolant left behind contaminants 
on the expansion tank. 

The coolant expansion tank of the E60 is pro¬ 
vided with a drain edge all round the cap. This 
drain edge serves to catch the escaping 
coolant. 

Inside the drain edge is a drain channel which 
passes through the expansion tank. The 
escaping coolant is routed through this drain 
channel to the right-hand wheel-arch trim, kt-061603 

where it evaporates. 




Workshop Exercise - Electric Fan Removal 


The electric fan can be removed without removing the coolant connection (1) and the 
mounting plate with thermostat (3). 


With Instructor’s assistance, remove the electric 

fan. 

1. Remove the top connecting plate (complete 
vehicle section) and radiator top cover. 

2. Lift the fan (slightly) out of the “U” shaped 
retaining brackets (left and right) and fold in 
the “hinged” tab (left side - arrow) to gain 
clearance. 

3. Then the electric fan can be removed the rest 
of the way. The electric fan motor (2) remains 
in place until the fan assembly is removed 
from vehicle. 





KT-11157 B 


Note: When installing electric fan, remember to unfold the “hinged” tab before fitting into 
“U” shaped brackets.

N62 Engine 

Purpose of The System 


The E60 545i is equipped with the N62B44 (NG - New Generation) engine used in the E65. 
Please refer to ST042 E65 Complete Vehicle Part 2 for additional details and information. 


The development objectives were: 

• Reduction in fuel consumption 

• Reduction in emissions 

• Increased power 

• Improved torque and torque curve 

• Improved engine acoustics 


To achieve these objectives, enhancements 
were made in the following areas: 

• Engine mechanicals 

• Treatment of exhaust emissions 

• Valve timing 

• Engine management control 

• Intake air flow 

• Electric fan only (no viscous fan) 


The most important features of the 
new N62 engine are: 

• 8 cylinders in a 90° V configu¬ 
ration 

• 2 four-valve cylinder heads 

• Light-alloy design 

• Newly-developed variable 
intake manifold 

• Valvetronic system 



43-02-01 


In conjunction with the Variable Intake Manifold, the Valvetronic system adapts the intake 
valve lift to ensure optimum cylinder filling. The throttle valve use is limited during engine 
operation to maintain a constant intake manifold vacuum.

Valvetronic 


Over the entire speed and load range, the gasoline engine needs a combustible fuel-air 
mixture within the ideal ratio (Lambda = 1). The mixture quantity must be altered to vary 
the speed and output. This variation is effected by the throttle valve. The mixture, which 
falls within the narrow range of Lambda = 1, is formed outside the combustion chamber 
using the fuel injection system (external mixture formation). 

The mixture control is influenced by the throttle valve and is not optimal in all the different 
load ranges. This is particularly true in the idle to part-load ranges, since the throttle valve 
is only opened slightly in these ranges. The consequences are less than optimal cylinder 
filling, torque and increased fuel consumption. 

Technical measures were previously introduced; such as the optimization of air/fuel mixing, 
improved valve overlap, introduction of DISA and the steady improvement of mixture con¬ 
trol all depend on the throttle valve. This is where the completely unique Valvetronic design 
comes in. 



43-02-27 


The Valvetronic system simultaneously varies the valve opening time and the valve opening 
lift between 0.3 mm and 9.85 mm, according to engine speed and load. This means that 
the air/fuel mixture volume is controlled according to engine requirements. This type of 
mixture and volume control makes the typical throttle valve control unnecessary.
