E60 Complete Vehicle 

Purpose of the System 

The E60 is the fifth edition of the BMW 5 Series replacing the E39. The automobile revo¬ 
lution in design and engineering initiated by the E65/E66 now finds its logical continuation 
in the E60. Virtually all the significant innovations of the 7 Series are also offered in the 5 
Series. 

However the E60 also offers new features of its own, some of which will make their appear¬ 
ance in other model series in due time. The most important of these new features are: 

• Active steering system, whose variable reduction ratio adapts itself to the relevant driving 
situation. 

• Lightweight design with a front-end structure of bonded and riveted aluminum (GRAV). 

• Head-up display, which projects the most important information such as vehicle speed 
or navigation arrows in the form of a virtual image directly into the driver's field of vision. 

• Adaptive directional headlight system, which adapts itself continuously to the steering 
angle and thus illuminates the approaching bend. 


BMW 5 Series - Brief History 


The El 2 


The first BMW to be christened the "5 Series" was the El 2. 
In 1972 this model in the form of the "520" began the system 
of model designation which has remained to this day: The 
first number stands for the model series, while the second 
and third numbers represent the cubic capacity. 

A total of 702,242 El 2s from the 518 to the 535i were pro¬ 
duced in Dingolfing and Munich until 1985.

The E28 


The successor model E28, which at first glance appeared to 
have only minor modifications, brought the production fig¬ 
ures to 723,001 with the model designations 518i to 535i 
between 1980 and 1990. 

From January 1983 production of the 5 Series - with the 
exception of the M5 offered for the first time - was confined 
exclusively to Dingolfing. 1983 was also the year when the 
524td became the first 5 Series to feature a diesel engine. 



KT-9490 


The E34 


The 3rd generation 5 Series registered a major increase in 
production volume: Between 1987 and 1996 a total of 
1,330,661 E34s came off the Dingolfing production line. The 
engine range of four- and six-cylinder models was extended 
to include a V8 (518i to 540i) and rounded off by diesel 
engines (525td and 525tds) and the high-performance M5. 

A second bodystyle was also introduced in the form of the 5 
Series touring, which also included a version that ran on liq¬ 
uefied petroleum gas (518g touring). A four-wheel drive was 
also produced in both saloon and touring versions in the form 
of the 525ix. 



KT-9489 


The E39 


The current 5 Series was launched in 1995, of which to date 
1,362,884 have been built (as at: 30 September 2002). In 
addition to the standard saloon and touring, there is also a 
safety saloon version of the E39 (540i Protection). 

The engine options available range from the 518i to the 540i 
(diesel: 520d to 530d), as well as the M5.

The new E60 - Highlights and Design 

The BMW Group's new design strategy with its broadening of the family resemblance lends 
future BMW model series still more individual character. It is thus possible for the E60 to 
embody the values of the 3 Series (dynamic and sporty) as well as those of the 7 Series 
(successful, top of the range and sporty) and yet remain an individual and original car with¬ 
in the scope of traditional BMW model series. 

Unlike its competitors - and also its predecessors at BMW in previous years - the new 5 
Series demonstrates its own clearly recognizable lines: The unique character of the individ¬ 
ual model series within the overall range of the BMW marque will in future be increasingly 
accentuated. The new 5 Series therefore comes across neither as a small 7 Series nor as 
a big 3 Series.

The front end makes a bold and dynamic state¬ 
ment. 

The most striking features are the new twin 
headlights and the dramatically sloping hood 
lines on both sides which now already begin at 
the level of the earlier swage line. 

Flowing lines run from the headlights along the 
sides to the rear end of the E60. 



KT-11012

E60 Complete Vehicle 




























The side line is a logical extension of the front-end design. Thus the E60 is the first BMW 
model not to have the previously typical side swage line. Its place is taken by a character 
line, an edge of light which lends the side view a whole new character. Various light reflec¬ 
tions above and below this line produce a play of light and shadow, thereby giving the 
impression of a very low side panel. 



The transition from the hood to the side panel occurs in the imaginary extension of the 
character line. Thus the E60 has the lowest front end ever of any BMW. The sculpture-like 
appearance of the side view is consolidated by the fact that there are no protective strips 
in the door areas. 

Despite its increased height, the passenger cell has a coupe-like appearance thanks to the 
sweeping design of the C-pillar. Short overhangs and generously dimensioned wheel arch¬ 
es accentuate the dynamic, bold overall appearance. The clear shaping of the wheel lips 
as a typical BMW design element emphasize the wide track of the E60. 

The rear end conveys an at once wide and compact effect due to the fact that there are no 
visible joints. Under the high deck lid with integrated spoiler lies the biggest luggage com¬ 
partment in the current BMW range. The rear lights are mounted in brilliant optical hous¬ 
ings, the tops of which are sloping in appearance. 


The large rear apron of the E60 is subdivided 
gives the impression of being lighter. 

A distinctive diffuser lip not only ensures opti¬ 
mum aerodynamics but also reduces the 
amount of dirt which accumulates on the vehi¬ 
cle rear end. 

The overall impression communicates an 
unmistakable sense of the E60's power and 
strength to road-users driving behind it.

System Components 

Body Structure 


The body dimensions have been increased to improve roominess in the rear compartment 
(+ 5 cm knee room) and to increase the luggage compartment capacity (at 520 Lthe largest 
capacity of all the BMW vehicles including the E65). 


In order to make the E60 signifi¬ 
cantly lighter than the current 5 
Series, BMW designed a 
"reduced-weight aluminum front 
end" (GRAV). 

The front end consists almost 
entirely of aluminum while the 
transition to steel occurs in the 
front bulkhead area. Aluminum 
components are shown in darker 
shaded (front clip) section. 



The weight saving at the front end not only reduces the total weight of the vehicle but is 
also a significant factor in the E60 attaining the ideal axle-load distribution of 50/50. 


On the one hand, an aluminum body sec¬ 
tion offers reduced shielding against 
external electrical radiation, making it nec¬ 
essary for separate shielding of the wiring 
harnesses and electronic control units. 

On the other hand, riveted and bonded 
aluminum components do not always 
provide a guaranteed circuit to ground. 
This results in individual front end compo¬ 
nents being connected (in production) 
with small EMC safety weld seams and in 
the event of repair, with grounding straps.

KT-11777

E60 Complete Vehicle 











The transition from the aluminum front engine 
support rail to the steel rail section joint (connec¬ 
tion) is produced by bonding and punch riveting. 

To increase conductivity, ground points are locat¬ 
ed on the two rails and are connected with a 
ground strap. 

In addition to the underhood strut tower V- struts 
(2 lower left), the bumper carrier (1 lower right) 
and thrust panel (2 lower right) provide addition¬ 
al reinforcement and structural rigidity. 






Note: The V-struts, bumper carrier and thrust panel must be installed and properly torqued 
before the vehicle is driven. If not, the rigidity of the front end will be considerably reduced 
leading to noise and structural damage . 



The crash box is a deformation element 
specially developed for the E60. 

The crash box is part of the side frame and is 
secured at the bottom of the A-pillar. 

In the event of a frontal crash, the crash box 
absorbs forces that are transmitted via the front 
wheel into the side frame in the sill area.

KT-11780

E60 Complete Vehicle 







The E60 also integrates the familiar side impact 
protection gards (steel). 

These are bolt on parts that must be replaced 
when damaged. 


Body Repair 



Repairing an aluminum body requires completely new repair methods in body shops with 
properly trained personnel, as well as proper tools and equipment. 


Aluminum materials can not be “stretched”, this rules out the possibility of pulling on a 
straightening bench. Components deformed as a result of an accident must always be 
replaced, which incurs more extensive training, tools and assembly procedures than is the 
case with steel bodies. 


Using the frame rail as an example, deformed E60 aluminum components must be cut off 
at permanently defined points and replaced by new components. 


Special insert repair elements made of aluminum 
are required to ensure that the replacement parts 
are safely and securely held in place. 

The insert element for repairing aluminum (top 
left) is inserted into profile chambers and then 
expanded into place by bolts (refer to the E60 
SIP for more details).

Front Bumper System 


The bumpers are integrated in the vehicle structure. The front and rear one-piece plastic 
bumper panels are finished in body color and wrap around as far as the wheel arches. 
There are differences between the EU and US country-specific versions due to the differ¬ 
ent legal requirements regarding certain impact speeds (4 and 8 km/h). The front cross¬ 
panel is made entirely of aluminum. The components of the cross-panel are finished in an 
electrodeposition dip-coating process. 


Removing and Refitting the Front Bumper Trim Panel 

• Remove the screws attaching the trim panel to the wheel-arch liners 

• Remove the three lower grill inserts (snap out) and remove the lower trim panel screws 
(under the bumper cross member) 

• Un-snap and remove the hood seal assembly (flat blade screw driver will assist in releas¬ 
ing the snaps) 

• Remove the bolts attaching the trim panel to the top mounting bracket (front cross¬ 
panel) 

CAUTION! 

Once all fasteners have been removed, push the bumper trim panel rearwards (at each cor¬ 
ner) and pull the corners out to slide it out of the side mounting brackets (the trim panel 

has locking hooks). Failure to do so will cause damage! 

• When refitting the front bumper trim panel, the headlamps must first be adjusted and 
aligned with the side panels (see headlight section) 

• The bumper trim panel is clipped into the side mounting brackets 

• The bumper trim panel is aligned with the headlamps 

• Tighten all bolts and wheel-arch liner screws. 


Replacing the Kidney Grille 

• The bumper trim panel must be removed in order replace the kidney grille.

Headlights 


The Adaptive Headlight (AHL) function is available as an option. It is offered in combination 
with the Bi-xenon headlights. This feature allows the low beam headlamps to swivel around 
the vertical axis. This means that the headlights can illuminate the curve of the road more 
effectively when negotiating bends. 

Adaptive Headlights improve night-time visibility by continual adjustment of headlight aim to 
suit the curvature of the road. Illumination of the curve of the road allows the driver to fol¬ 
low its course more easily instead of having to drive into a "black hole." Dynamic headlamp 
aim adjustment improves peripheral awareness and reduces the risk of accidents. 


1. Design feature (with bi-xenon headlights contains 
LEDs for side marker light) 

2. Direction indicators 

3. Reflector for low headlights 

4. Fibre-optic ring lights for side lights 

5. Reflector for high beam headlight 



Halogen Headlights 

The headlamp reflectors are framed by fiber-optic ring lights. The side light function is 
effected by the two reflectors. Above the direction indicators is a PCB with 6 LEDs and a 
fiber-optic tube to perform the side marker light function (not separately replaceable). The 
direction indicator function is performed by a 21W long-life bulb. 

For parking lights, a 5W bulb supplies the fiber-optic ring light and 
produces a hot spot in the lower part of the reflector. 

The low beam headlight function is performed by an H7 long-life 
bulb in each of the outer reflectors. 


The high beam headlight function is performed by an H7 long-life 
bulb in each of the inner reflectors. 




The flash to pass simply uses the high beam light only. 



16 

E60 Complete Vehicle 


KT-71003 









Bi-xenon Headlights (optional) 

Bi-xenon headlights are only available as an option in combination with the Adaptive 
Headlights feature (for additional detailed information, refer to AHL section). A dynamic 
beamheight adjustment function is also incorporated in the Bi-xenon headlight package. 

The Bi-xenon bulbs are fitted in the outer reflectors. On each Bi-xenon headlight there is a 
stepper motor for adjusting the position of the Bi-xenon bulb. The Bi-xenon control units 
and the stepper motor controllers (SMCs) are located next to each other on the underside 
of the headlamp units. 

The stepper motors are not fitted with motor position sensors, the zero position is detect¬ 
ed by the zero position sensor (below the Bi-xenon bulb). The zero position is sensed by 
changes in inductivity. 

The direction indicator function is performed by a 21W long-life bulb. Above the direction 
indicators is a PCB with 6 LEDs and a fiber-optic tube to perform the side marker light func¬ 
tion (not separately replaceable). 

For parking lights, the headlamp reflectors are framed by fiber¬ 
optic ring lights. The ring lights are supplied by a 10W bulb with 
a reflector. The reflector is in the headlamp unit near the high 
beam headlight. 

The low beam headlight function is performed by a Bi-xenon 
bulb (D2S) in each of the outer reflectors. The Xenon control unit 
controls the Bi-xenon bulb function (low beam/high beam). 

The high beam headlight function is performed only by the Bi¬ 
xenon lights and not by the halogen lights in the inner reflectors. 

In each inner reflector there is an H7 long-life bulb, which is used 
for the flash to pass function.

E60 Complete Vehicle 







US-Version System Functions 

The country-specific US version incorporates the following functions that differ from the EU 
version: 

- High beam headlights. If Bi-xenon bulbs are fitted, the high beam headlight function is 
performed only by the Bi-xenon lights and not by the halogen lights in the inner reflectors. 

- Daytime lights. The daytime lights function is performed by the fiber-optic ring lights. 


Workshop Hints 

The lens is permanently bonded to the headlight unit casing. The headlight units are 
adjustable along the x, y and z axes. Vertical adjustment of the headlight units is performed 
by the inner socket-head adjuster screws. Horizontal adjustment of the headlight units is 
performed by the outer socket-head adjuster screws. 

• The bulbs in the halogen headlights can be replaced with the headlight unit in place. 

• Replacement of the bulbs in the Bi-xenon headlights requires removal of the headlight 
unit. 

Headlight Unit Removal and Installation 

Note: It is suggested to mark the headlight location around the adjustment mounts and 
attaching screws before removal. 

• The headlight unit is removed by removing the top 2 screws from the front crosspanel 
and the bottom 2 screws from the mounting bracket. 

• The headlight unit is removed forwards and then lifted upwards, detaching one main har¬ 
ness connection. The stepper motor for the Adaptive Headlights is replaceable. 

• For installation, the headlamps must first be adjusted and aligned with the side panels 
(slides in adjustment slots with bolts loose, up/dn adjustment by a threaded mount). 
The bumper trim panel is then aligned to the headlamp units.

1. Direction indicator 

2. Brake force light 

3. Reverse light 

4. Reflector 

5. Tail light/brake light 

6. Tail light/brake light 

7. Side marker light 


The bulbs for the for the tail light, brake light, direction indicator and brake force light are all 
held in a common bulb holder with a central connector. All of those lights use 21W long¬ 
life bulbs. The reverse light has a separate bulb holder (16W bulb). The lower part of the 
rear light cluster contains a reflector. 

The tail light function is performed by two of the rear light cluster compartments. The light 
is provided by the 21W long-life bulbs in each compartment, which are dimmed to 6 to 7 
Watts. 

The brake light function is performed by a 21W long-life bulb in the outer compartment of 
each rear light cluster. For the Brake Force Display system, the inner rear light cluster com¬ 
partment is used as an additional brake light. 

The direction indicator function is performed by a 21W long-life bulb. The reverse light 
function is performed by a 16W long-life bulb on each side (which is replaced with the 
holder). 



KT-11178 


Each rear light cluster is attached to the body by 4 bolts and nuts. Between each rear light 
cluster and the body there is a gasket seal. The rear light clusters are subdivided into com¬ 
partments: 


US-Version System Functions 

- Side marker light. The outer partition of the outer compartment of the rear light cluster 
has an opening through which the tail light illuminates the rear side marker light. 

- Brake Force Display. To improve the reaction of other drivers in a panic stop, the E60 
has a Brake Force Display System. If an extreme deceleration rate or ABS signal is 
detected, the bulbs will receive the full 21 Watts of power and the brake light plus Brake 
Force Display function is illuminated.

Removing and Refitting the Rear Bumper Trim Panel 

• The rear lamp units must be removed before removing or refitting the rear bumper trim 
panel 

• Remove the 4 self-tapping screws on each side of the wheel-arch liners to the bumper 
trim panel through the side mounting brackets 

• Remove the expander rivet on each side of the vehicle attaching the bumper trim panel 
to each side mounting bracket (below the wheel-arch liners) 

• Remove 4 self tapping screws that are screwed through the bodywork into each bumper 
trim panel side insert from inside the luggage compartment 

• The bumper trim panel must be unclipped from the bottom guide (flat blade screw dri¬ 
ver will assist in releasing the clip) 


The following points should be noted when refitting: 

• From inside the luggage compartment, an Allen key is used to adjust the gap between 
the bumper trim panel and the body by squaredrive socket-head adjuster bolts in the 
bumper trim panel side inserts 

• After adjusting the bumper trim panel position using the Allen key, the 4 self tapping 
screws are screwed into the bumper trim panel side inserts from inside the luggage com¬ 
partment through the same holes in the body panel that were used to access the adjuster 
bolts. 

• Install the rear lamp units and align with the luggage compartment lid and the side 
panels.

The front doors are attached to the A-pillar by two hinges each held by a central bolt (Ml 2) 
and a specially shaped brace plate. The brace plates are inside the A-pillars. The hinges 
are bolted onto the pillars from the outside. The hinge bolts screw directly into a thread 
inside the brace plates. 


Like the front doors, the rear doors use 
the new hinge design with a central hinge 
bolt (Ml 2). In this case, however, the bolt 
is inserted through the B-pillar from the 
inside. It then screws directly into a 
thread inside the hinge backplate.
