Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




Understanding Diagnostics 


Trial and error creates inconvenience for the Customer and the Service Department 
when misdiagnosis or longer waits occur as the technician tries different repair 
attempts. This is against BMW’s promise to the customer to “Fix it right the first time, 
on time, every time”. 

If the vehicle is not repaired efficiently the productivity of the technician suffers. Taking 
some time at the beginning to plan a diagnostic course of action can help give structure 
to what may appear in the beginning to be a chaotic situation. 

As future systems increase in complexity so does their dependency on the Diagnosis 
Program as the principle tool for troubleshooting. However, the importance of under¬ 
standing the calculated steps of a basic troubleshooting plan is just as important as 
before. 

There will always be instances where the Test Modules provided by ISTA need to be 
supplemented by a thoughtful diagnostic plan that is created by the skilled technician. 

A parallel diagnostic plan that includes proper recording of test data along with the 
Diagnosis Program is a good habit to follow every time that troubleshooting is reguired. 

A successful diagnostic plan will: 

• Save repair time. 

• Satisfy the customer by reducing vehicle down time. 

• Increase Center profitability. 

• Increase technician pride and earnings. 

Diagnostic Plan 

The Diagnostic Plan consists of 5 steps: 

1. Verify the Customer Complaint -“Experience the Symptom!” 

2. Analyze the Problem. 

3. Isolate the Problem. 

4. Repair the Problem. 

5. Verify the Repair. 

Verify the Customer Complaint: Experience the symptom! 

Most troubleshooting starts the moment you receive a written description of the cus¬ 
tomer complaint. The complaint is the customer’s description of a symptom that they 
are experiencing with the vehicle. 

Symptom 

A symptom is any circumstance, event or condition that accompanies something and 
indicates its existence or occurrence. 


9 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




There may be multiple symptoms that are created with one problem. 

An example is a defective thermostat: If the thermostat is stuck open the heater output 
will be insufficient, also, if the engine can never reach operating temperature then fuel 
mileage and performance will suffer. Which one of these complaints (symptoms) would 
lead you to the problem faster? 

What is important to remember is that the customer may only complain about one 
symptom. It is the job of the technician to be a detective and carefully observe. There 
may be another symptom not complained of that directly points to the root cause of the 
problem. 

Steps to Verify the Complaint 

• Before getting in the vehicle, review the R.O., confirm this is the correct vehicle. 

• Is any additional information needed about the complaint? Certain questions to 
the customer can help narrow this step. 

• Is the problem intermittent? What are the conditions (roads, temp., speed, etc.)? 
What is the frequency of the occurrence? 

• Test drive if drivability related or the conditions require, duplicate conditions as 
stated by customer. 

• Was the complaint reproduced? 

• Is knowledge of system or vehicle sufficient? 

• Review reference training material and owner’s handbook for a description of 
feature operation. 

• Research complaint in SIB’s. 

• Research past repair history on vehicle. 

Analyze the Problem 

After verification of the complaint, analyze the problem. Use all resource available 
to aid in system diagnostics: 

• Vehicle Fault Memory 

• ETM, Repair Manual, SIB, etc. 

• Vehicle Repair History 

• Training Handouts 

• Round Table Information 

• Hotline 

• Known Good Vehicle 

Analyzing the problem allows for the development of a repair plan. 

10 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 





Steps in Analyzing the Problem 

• Perform a Short Test. 

• Does an SIB pertain to this vehicle? 

• Refer to the Function Description for additional system information. 

• Is a test plan available for this system? 

• Use fault symptom selection. 

• Perform Diagnosis Request. 

Isolate the Problem 

To isolate the problem is “to place apart from others”. 

The object here is to zoom in on the problem area. It is easy to be overwhelmed by a 
problem, just reaching for an ETM can add to the confusion. ISTA provides automatic 
tests in test modules to aid in the determination of the exact area or cause of the problem. 

The elimination of components from the diagnostic trail, shortens the path. 

The first question asked should be: 

• Is the problem Hydraulic, Mechanical or Electrical? 

Save time by NOT testing components that could not create the problem. 

Steps in Isolating the Problem 

• Use Test Modules. 

• Perform electrical tests with the IMIB or a DVOM. 

• Consult fault charts in Repair or Diagnostic Procedures Manuals. 

• Control Module Self Diagnosis. 

• Use appropriate special tools (e.g. battery draw tester, tank leakage adapters, 
breakout boxes, etc.). 

• Substitute a known good part. 


Workshop Hint 

If a TEST PLAN is not available: 

• Think about the system in its entirety. 

• Be sure the normal operation is understood. 

• Develop a PLAN. 

• Use all available resources. fg 

• Don’t try to diagnose the entire system at 
once, break it into manageable chunks. 

• Check the easy things first. It would waste 

time to install the breakout boxes to find a 
bad bulb. 1-—- 


If a TEST PLAN js available: 

• Do not skip steps. 

• Never assume results without doing a step. 

• Recheck your work. 


11 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 











Repair the Problem 

Repair the problem using approved repair techniques and parts. Having verified, isolated 
and analyzed the problem the last step is to repair or replace the component. Before 
installing that shiny new part, take one last step back from the vehicle to ask a final set of 
questions. 

• Could another component have caused this part to fail? 

• Were all the instructions in the Test Plan or Diagnostic Procedures followed? 

• Is there anything that might have been overlooked? 

Confident that the proper diagnosis has been made, complete the repairs. 

Steps to Repairing the Problem 

• Follow the instructions in the repair manual. 

• Refer to Construction Groups in the microfiche if necessary. 

• Follow specific guidelines for wire harness repair or replacement. 

• Make proper adjustments after installing the part. 

• Perform Coding or Programming if required. 

• Make sure another problem is not created in performing this repair. 

Verify the Repair 

Always recheck for the complaint under the same conditions used to verify. 

The object is to prove the problem does not resurface. 

• Clear the fault codes. 

• Test drive the car. 

• Check for re-occurring fault codes. 

• Clear adaptations if necessary. 

• Recheck the part installation for missing bolts or tie wraps. 


Workshop Hints 


• Follow repair or replacement procedures 
as detailed in TIS. 

• Use only genuine parts.

The I.P.O. Principle 


Control modules receive information from sensors advising them of certain operating 
conditions. This information is identified as Input to the control modules. The Input con¬ 
tinually informs the control modules of conditions that may be changing. 

The control module then process the Input information comparing it to programmed 
responses or commands based on every possible operating condition. The control 
module decides based on the programming and the Input conditions which output 
signal to operate. 

The control module, based on the processing that has occurred, then sends a signal to 
a component changing the status of that component. The components respond to the 
output signal of the control module. 



Any device controlled by a processor requires input to the alert the operating program 
of a condition. The program processes the input information and logically activates an 
output of a component. 

All BMW control systems are explained by the IPO principle. It is the key to understand¬ 
ing all BMW control system technologies.

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




























































































Diagnosis with I8TA 


Introduction 

The programs and documents of the ISTA workshop system contain information on 
troubleshooting vehicles built by the BMW Group. The technical content is coordinated 
within the BMW Group and with the supplier companies. The proper vehicle repair will 
only be guaranteed if this information is followed and the scope of repair is carried out in 
accordance with the displayed instructions. 

A poorly or inadequately carried-out diagnosis may result in the testing or repair expen¬ 
diture you are claiming for within the framework of a warranty or goodwill claim not 
being accepted or not being fully accepted. 

Diagnostic Procedure 

Diagnostic procedures/test plans (ABL’s) are available for all electrical and electro¬ 
mechanical vehicle systems. Diagnostic ABL’s are also available for selected mechanical 
systems or fault patterns (Non-electric Diagnosis). 

Troubleshooting using the ISTA workshop system will then always be necessary: 

a. If the fault falls within the functional range of electrical components and the faulty 
component or fault source is not clearly and demonstrably identifiable. 

b. If the fault causes an indicator light to come on. 

c. If the fault falls within the area of the mechanical system 
clearly and demonstrably identifiable. 

d. If the fault falls within the area of the mechanical system 
repair is too costly. 

e. If a TeileClearing is active for the faulty component. 

y Please observe!

Detailed information on which electrical or electromechanical scopes 
require no diagnosis can be found in "Component repair without

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 






Diagnosis Sequence 


1. Starting diagnosis 

The current software version including the current program and data updates must be 
installed on the workshop system before the start of diagnosis. 

2. Troubleshooting with a test schedule and hit list 

It is not technically possible for all fault states of a system to be contained in the fault 
memory. For this reason, the following procedure must be followed for the full trou¬ 
bleshooting of a system: 

2.1 Test schedule for stored faults: 

If a <Test schedule> is calculated after the <Brief test>, only the procedures (ABL’s) that 
are displayed are needed for working through the stored faults. It is therefore possible by 
selecting <Fault pattern> to additionally select the vehicle subsystems which demon¬ 
strate a malfunction. 


2.2 Test schedule for stored faults and known fault patterns: 

If a vehicle subsystem was selected in the <Fault pattern> selection, the procedures for 
stored faults are displayed in the <Test scheduled as are the procedures for faults cur¬ 
rently known to occur frequently. 

2.3 Information search: 

If the fault cannot be identified by using the procedures in the <Test schedule> addition¬ 
al procedures must be selected via the information search>. The search for procedures 
must take place via the <Function structured 

2.4 Functional structure - [!] Current fault patterns: 

After the function levels are selected in the <Function structure> (e.g. 03 Body > Heating 
and air conditioning functions), the level <[!] Current fault patterns> is selected first. This 
level contains an overview of known fault patterns for which separate procedures are 
available. 


Note that all software dependent scopes are determined on the basis 
! \ of the integration level of the connected vehicle. Therefore this list is 
specific to the vehicle. 


2.5 Procedures (ABL’s): 

All other known malfunctions and the entire scope of functional checks are contained in 
the procedures that are associated with the vehicle functions in the <Function struc¬ 
tured These procedures make it possible to check all relevant components of a sub¬ 
function. 


41 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




2.6 NED non-electrical diagnosis procedures : 

Access to the NED non-electrical diagnosis procedures has been simplified as of 
ISTA 2.28. 

Direct access is available from the function structure through: 

• Non-electrical diagnosis- NED 

You can filter by: 

• Engine 

• Chassis and suspension 

• Body 

• Types of fault 

• Customer experience 

2.7 Hit list: 

The procedures found in this way via the function structure are displayed in the 
<Hit list>. By working through the relevant procedures, you ensure that the current trou¬ 
bleshooting information is displayed. 

3. Carrying out procedures 

In the case of the procedures mentioned in the <Test schedule> and <Hit list>, it is first 
necessary to check which procedures are connected with the customer complaint or the 
identified malfunction. These procedures must be called up as a matter of priority and 
worked through. Procedures, once they have been started, must be worked through in 
their entirety. Processing is finished when, after the message "Procedure ended 
Continue in test schedule" is output, the user clicks on the <Next> button to return to 
the <Test schedule> or the <Hit list>. Only then will all the diagnostic codes displayed in 
the procedure be stored in the diagnosis report. Aborting a procedure early will only then 
be permitted if one of the following factors exists: 

a. Procedure selected by mistake 

b. Program fault reguires cancelling 

Also, not all the procedures take the form of guided test sequences. In many of the pro¬ 
cedures the diagnosis user has the opportunity to decide for him-/herself which tests are 
to be conducted. These procedures end with a prompt to report back (feedback dia¬ 
logue) the established test result. Here the user must select the test result which, on the 
basis of the available information and test results, has led to the decision to implement a 
repair measure. 

Procedures which are obviously not connected with the customer complaint, the identi¬ 
fied malfunction or an indicator light coming on can be ignored. 


42 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




Please observe! 

If, in the case of sporadically occurring malfunctions, no fault can be identified in the 
course of a procedure, the diagnosis user can decide for hirrWherself which repair mea¬ 
sure is to be implemented. The following information must be taken into consideration: 

- Fault description by the customer 

- Fault memory and fault memory details 

- Fault code descriptions 

- Documents and notes displayed in the procedure 

- Current information from Technical Support 

(Service Information Bulletins, PuMA measures, Training manuals, etc.). 

- Findings from previous troubleshooting and repair measures 

In the case of procedures with feedback dialogue, the repair measure that has been car¬ 
ried out must be selected. 

Furthermore, in those cases where the fault cause could not be clearly identified using a 
procedure, the user must enter a technical reason for the repair in the comment field for 
the warranty or goodwill claim. 

4. Dealing with stored faults 

The situation may arise where a control unit stores a fault even though no malfunction 
is perceived. In addition, it is possible for faults, whose causes have already been 
eliminated, to be stored in the vehicle. It is therefore not unusual - above all in vehicles 
with high mileage - for faults to be stored which are not connected with a customer 
complaint or an identified fault pattern. It is therefore necessary when performing diagno¬ 
sis to use the fault memory details to check which fault entries can be ignored. 

The following fault memory details is particularly important in this context: 

- Current fault status (permanent fault/non-permanent fault) 

- Kilometer reading/mileage when the fault last occurred 

- Fault frequency 

Replacing a component on the basis of the fault entry will only then be justified if it is 
clear from the fault memory details that the stored fault is connected with the customer 
complaint or the fault pattern. 

Please observe! 

In the procedures the faults are generally not read out of the vehicle again. The ABL 
always uses the fault memory scope that was determined during the <Brief test>. 
Therefore, if additional faults occur or if a fault status was eliminated by a repair, this 
does not automatically change the fault list stored in ISTA. 


43 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 



Please observe! (cont.) 

The fault memory list stored in ISTA is only updated if a new brief test is carried out or 
if a <Control unit test> is performed via the <Control unit functions> for an individual 
control unit. 

The current status of a stored fault can be read out in the <Procedure> or via the <Fault 
memory list> by selecting <Update>. 

5. Taking current technical information into account 

In addition to the diagnostic programs information on current technical problems, there is 
also useful information published through special media and systems (e.g. Training 
Manuals, Service Round Tables, Service Information Bulletins or PuMA measures). This 
information must also be taken into account in the course of troubleshooting. 

If the repair measure recommended in the procedure differs from the current informa¬ 
tion, this must be entered in the comment field for the warranty or goodwill claim. 

6. Implementing programming or encoding measures 

Programming, encoding, enabling and replacement of control units are carried out with 
the ISTA/P programming system. The currently valid user documentation and the addi¬ 
tional information on ISTA/P must be read and observed. When performing control unit 
replacement actions it is necessary above all to follow the procedure "Replacement 
with/without session interruption" described in the user documentation. 

As of now it is no longer necessary to transfer "Warranty code" displayed in the proce¬ 
dure to the warranty or goodwill claim. In the future the "Warranty code" will no longer be 
output in the procedure. 

7. Using control unit functions 

The <Control unit functions> offer the opportunity to access known diagnostic functions 
quickly. However, using the Control unit functions does not replace carrying out the pro¬ 
cedures, as: 

a. No additional notes and instructions are provided in the control unit functions. 

b. No setpoint values are displayed in the control unit functions. 

8. Delete fault memory 

When the vehicle has been repaired, all the stored faults must be deleted using the 
<Delete fault memory> function. 

9. Feedback of faults in the diagnostic programs 

If faults/errors are found in the diagnostic programs or documents in the course of a 
diagnosis, they should be reported via the feedback function integrated in ISTA. 


44 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 



Component Repair without Diagnosis 


Essentially, in the case of electrical or electromechanical components, it is always neces¬ 
sary to perform troubleshooting using the ISTA workshop system. However there are 
faults which are clearly and obviously identifiable. 

For the following cases it is not absolutely necessary to use the ISTA workshop system 
for troubleshooting; Replacement of: 

• faulty bulbs (with the exception of xenon bulbs and light sources for LED headlights) 

• operating elements with identifiable visual deficiencies 

• electrical components whose retaining elements are broken 

• electrical components which are faulty as a result of water ingress or a thermal 
event (excluding control units) 

• mechanical engine components which demonstrate clear leaks or mechanical 
damage 

• display elements with identifiable visual or mechanical faults 

• faulty fanfare horns, cigarette lighters or power sockets. 



Components for which a TeileClearing is active are 
excluded from this! 


The specifications in the document "Contents of Non-electrical 
Diagnosis" found on ISTA, must also be observed! 


As a rule, there are no special tests in the test modules or sometimes no test modules 
for the mentioned cases. It must be noted that faulty electrical components which are 
connected to control units usually result in fault entries. Replacing the component can 
also result in fault entries. Following repair the fault memories of the control units must 
therefore be deleted. 

The repair must be made in accordance with the directions in the repair instructions 
(REP). 


45 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




Test Schedule and Priority 

The result of the calculated test schedule is displayed on the Test schedule tab. 

The importance of the suspected objects is listed in the 'Priority' column. The Service 
employee uses this as a guide to sequence which test schedule procedures should be 
carried out. 

The test schedule is calculated and a certain processing sequence defined based on 
specific technical algorithms. However, the algorithm cannot reflect the valuable experi¬ 
ences of BMW Service employees or specific customer statements. Consequently the 
fault cause in the vehicle does not always match the sequence (priority) in the test 
schedule. For example, if a problem with the vehicle has already been described in some 
detail by a customer statement, compare the test schedule against the customer state¬ 
ment. Start working as appropriate, even if the test procedure you start with is not the 
first procedure in the test schedule. 

Retrofitting or converting 

For retrofitting or conversion work using ISTA/P, a new process must be created in 
ISTA otherwise the new control unit will not be recognized. 

Displaying and logging diagnosis codes 

The diagnosis codes and repair instructions shown on the display screen are saved in 
the diagnosis report only after exiting the screen mask by pressing "Continue". 

When the testing procedure is discontinued at this point, it is not logged. 

Moreover it is necessary to point out that repair instructions can still be displayed even 
after output of an instruction in the testing procedure. For this reason a testing proce¬ 
dure should always be performed until the message "Testing procedure concluded" 
appears. 

Fault memory list with filter function 

The fault memory list can be filtered using the KM axis and by filtering fault classes 
(e.g. undervoltage, overvoltage, information). 

The fault codes are entered on the vertical axis of the "KM Axis" mask and kilometer 
readings are entered on the horizontal axis. 

All fault classes that appear on the fault list are listed in the "Class" mask. Because all 
prepared fault memories are always displayed first on the fault list, the individual classes 
are preselected by default. The service employee can uncheck the check boxes to hide 
the individual classes including assigned fault memories in the fault memory list, but the 
fault memories will remain in the vehicle. If a fault memory could not be assigned to a 
class in the fault list, the "Class" tab will be disabled in the workshop system. 


46 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 



If the "Information" class is assigned to a specific fault memory, then this is not a fault to 
which a specific fault cause must be assigned. Rather, this fault memory serves as infor¬ 
mation indicating that a specific function is justifiably limited or it has been switched off 
(e.g. due to excess temperature). Detailed information about this fault memory is avail¬ 
able via "Display fault code". 


If the service employee filters by kilometer axis and by classes, the fault memory list will 
be reduced by both filter criteria. The test schedule calculation that is subsequently per¬ 
formed in the workshop system relates to the filtered fault memory list in addition to the 
fault patterns that were entered. The service employee can cancel the filter and recalcu¬ 
late the test schedule at any time. 


Notice!!! 


The service employee can cancel the filter and recalculate the 
test schedule at any time.

Control Unit Functions in ISTA 


The control unit functions offer the opportunity to access known diagnostic functions 
quickly. The control unit functions are opened in the Control unit tree or Control unit 
list mask. After a control unit is selected, the selected control unit is opened via the 
"Open CU functions" button. The control unit functions are distributed on the following 
tabs: 

Identification 

Display of the control unit name and the identification data of the control unit. By select¬ 
ing the "CU test" button, the identification data and the fault memory of the control unit 
are read in anew (single control unit test). 

In the faulty memory list and generally in the procedures (ABL’s), the 
only fault codes that are evaluated are those that were read out dur¬ 
ing the "Brief test" or the "CU test". There is no running update of 
the fault memory. Therefore, a "CU test" always needs to be per¬ 
formed if the fault memory of a control unit is read in anew during a 
diagnosis session. After the CU test is performed, the "Fault memory 
list" in the "Guided troubleshooting" menu is updated automatically. 

Diagnosis Query 

Display of the current states of a control unit (status display). 

The status displays (control unit functions) are subdivided into functional groups. 

Multiple control unit functions can be selected within a functional group. By selecting the 
"Query status" button, the selected control unit functions are transferred to the right side 
of the screen and the current values are read out of the vehicle. The displays are updat¬ 
ed continually. 

The query is ended when the "Query status" button is pressed again. 

Component Activation 

Activation of control unit outputs and control unit inputs. 

The activations (control unit functions) are subdivided into functional groups. 

Only one control unit function can be selected within a function group. The activation is 
executed when the "Activate component" is pressed. The details of the activation (dura¬ 
tion or type of activation) are displayed in the "Status" line. 

Depending on the type and duration of the activation, an active activation can be ended 
or repeated via the "Activate component" button (the button is optically pressed during 
the activation). The component activation also contains the "Delete fault memory" con¬ 
trol functions. This control unit function can delete the fault memory of the selected con¬ 
trol unit. After a fault memory is deleted, the "CU test" function must be executed on the 
"Identification" tab. Then the fault memory of the control unit is read in again and the 
fault memory list in the "Guided troubleshooting" menu is updated. 



50 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 





Restrictions 

The control unit functions do not contain setpoint values or additional text 
instructions. In addition, not all diagnosis and test options for functions and 
components are available in the control unit functions. Troubleshooting in the 
vehicle must therefore primarily be performed with the procedures. 


51 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 


































Fault Memory List in ISTA 

In the "fault memory" mask, the fault memories that are displayed are the ones that have 
been read out of the vehicle during the brief test or "control unit test" (individual control 
unit test). 

Furthermore, so-called service fault codes are also displayed (e.g. S 0001 No communi¬ 
cation possible with: instrument panel). Service fault codes are generated during the brief 
test (e.g. if no communication is possible with an installed control unit). However, they 
are not stored in the vehicle. 

Structure of the Fault Memory List 

The fault memory list is divided into 4 table columns: 

Code 

Display of the internal control unit fault code 

Description 

Brief description of the fault 

Kilometer reading 

Kilometer reading/ kilometer when the fault last occurred in the vehicle. 

The kilometer reading is recorded by all control units from series E65. 

If no kilometer reading is displayed for a fault, the control unit was unable 
to record a valid kilometer reading when the fault occurred. 

Category 

Starting with FOx, a fault can be allocated to a special fault category. The fault categories 
that are currently available are as follows: 

• Battery voltage < 9 V: At the time the fault occurred, the battery voltage 
was less than 9 volts. 

• Battery voltage > 16 V: At the time the fault occurred, the battery voltage 
was greater than 16 volts. 

• Information: The control unit has detected a functional limitation that can 
be traced back to an operating error, a function-related safety cutout (excess 
temperature, repeat interlock etc.) or a fault in a different control unit. 

The fault memory list can be sorted differently by tapping the column heading (e.g. kilo¬ 
meter reading). How the fault memory list is sorted does not affect the calculation of the 
test schedule. 


52 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 



Display Fault Code 

Further information on the fault memory can be displayed for a selected fault code entry 
(select fault memory in the table) via the "Display fault code" button. 

Description 

Fault code description on stored fault. The document contains basic information on 
when the fault is detected by the control unit and which fault causes lead to a fault code 
entry. 

Fault code descriptions are available for all fault memories starting F01. 

Details 

Display of the fault details of the fault memory stored in the control unit. 

By selecting the "Update" button, the fault details are re-read from the control unit. 

System context 

In the case of vehicles from the F series (starting F01), additional vehicle information 
(ambient conditions) are stored in a central fault memory (diagnosis master) if a fault 
occurs. In contrast to the fault details, the same ambient conditions are detected for 
all fault memories in a system context. This makes it possible to identify links between 
faults e.g. occurrence of secondary faults. 

Filter Fault Memory 

The filter function can reduce the size of the list of displayed faults without deleting faults 
from the control units. In the calculation of the test schedule, only the faults that corre¬ 
spond to the filter criteria and are therefore visible in the fault memory list will be taken 
into consideration. 

The fault memory list can be filtered via the kilometer axis and via fault category. 

Kilometer axis 

The fault codes (vertical axis) and the corresponding kilometer readings (horizontal axis) 
are displayed in the screen. Selecting the "Cursor" button activates the "Arrow buttons", 
which can be used to reduce the display to a certain kilometer range. In the case of vehi¬ 
cles from the Fx series, the kilometer readings from the diagnosis master are displayed. 

In the case of sporadic faults, a kilometer reading is given if the fault changes from "non¬ 
permanent fault" to "permanent fault". For all series from E65, the kilometer readings for 
the first and last occurrence of the sporadic fault are displayed.

Category 

All fault classes that appear on the fault memory list are listed in the Category mask. By 
deselecting the selection fields, the faults from a certain fault category (e.g. information) 
can be hidden from the fault memory list. If no fault memory in the fault memory list is 
assigned to a category, the "Category" tab is inactive. For troubleshooting on the vehicle, 
it is recommended to only use the fault memories that are not assigned to a category for 
the initial test schedule calculation. The filter settings of both masks are activated by 
selecting the "Apply" button. 

Calculate Test Schedule 

Selecting the "Calculate test schedule" button calculates a test schedule and calls up 
the "test schedule" mask. The test schedule only contains the fault memories that are 
displayed in the fault memory list.

1. Why are there so many buses? 

In principle there are three answers to this question: 

1. In fact there are not so many buses, as: all CAN buses are derived from 
the original PT-CAN and K-CAN buses. 

- All PT-CAN’s, as well as K-CAN2 and K-CAN3 have a high data 
transmission rate. 

- K-CAN has a low data transmission rate. 

- Many CAN buses in systems (sub-buses) are named according to these 
systems. This results in a large number of bus names. 

- The K-bus is similar: technically speaking the P-bus and l-bus are identical 
to the K-bus. 

2. The buses have been developed for different data transmission rates. 

- Buses with very high data transmission rates: 
byteflight, MOST bus, FlexRay and USB 

- Buses with medium data transmission rates: 

all the CAN buses such as PTCAN, K-CAN and the related buses 

- Buses with low data transmission rates: e.g. the LIN bus, BSD, etc. 

3. Viewed historically, the buses were either developed by various manufacturers 
or by BMW themselves: 

- Bus standards developed by various manufacturers are: 

CAN, LIN bus, MOST and FlexRay. 

- BMW's own standards are: 
byteflight, K-bus and K-CAN. 


57

2. What is a CAN? 

CAN (Controller Area Network) is a bus standard. CAN was developed in the 1980’s by 
Robert Bosch GmbH (together with universities). 

The aim was to network control units for the drive and suspension. 

In order for the control units to be able to communicate with one another a bus standard 
had to be defined. The bus standard determines how and which messages are transmit¬ 
ted between the control units. 

Components of a CAN message are: SOF, CRC, ID, DEL, ACK, KBT, EOF, IFS 

• SOF stands for ’’Start of Frame” 

• CRC means ’’Cyclic Redundancy Check” (i.e. check sum comparison) 

• ID stands for ’’Identification Feature” 

• DEL means ’’Delimiter” 

• ACK stands for ’’Acknowledge” (the message is free of errors). 

• KBT stands for ’’Control Bits” 

• EOF stands for ’’End of Frame” 

• IFS means ’’Inter Frame Space” 

CAN is currently the most common bus standard at BMW. CAN is a two-wire bus. 

There are several CAN buses with different data transmission rates in each car. CAN 
buses with different data transmission rates are connected with one another via 
gateways (i.e. data interfaces, e.g. JBE or ZGM). 


58 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




3. What do “High-speed” and “Low-speed” or “High” and “Low” mean in 
connection with CAN buses? 

“High-speed” and “Low-speed” indicate the data transmission rates of the CAN buses. 
At BMW there are two different data transmission rates for CAN buses: 

• 100 Kbps i.e. K-CAN 

• 500 Kbps e.g. PT-CAN, F-CAN, ICM-CAN, etc. 

“High” and “Low” are statements about the two wires of a two-wire bus. For example: 

• “PT-CAN-High”: Wire for the signal with the higher voltage value @ Binary 1 
(for this bus ~3.5V). 

• “PT-CAN-Low”: Wire for the signal with the lower voltage value @ Binary 1 
(for this bus ~1.5V). 

Data transmission on two wires is secure, “immune” from interference, and supports 
the electromagnetic compatibility. Although CAN bus communication can use standard 
cabling without shielding or twisted pair wiring, BMW utilizes the later to reduce EMI 
(Electro Magnetic Interference).

U JJ 


“ 0 ” 


The figures shows the two levels of data transmission in both the High-speed and 
Low-speed CAN’S. 

The PT-CAN is the ’’original” CAN (as developed by Robert Bosch GmbH). 

The F-CAN is just a faster CAN bus in the area of the suspension (also used as 
a sub-bus of the PTCAN). 

a The K-CAN can continue to work as a single wire bus in the event of 
failure. If a wire fails in the K-CAN, the data is still transmitted via the 
second data line. For this reason K-CAN is a very reliable data trans¬ 
mission bus.

4. What are the meanings of “ring”, “star” and “bus” in connection 
with data buses? 

The individual control units can be arranged differently on a data bus: 

• If the control units are positioned one after another on the bus, this is called: 
“linear bus topology”. 

• If the control units radiate outwards from a central control unit, this is called: 
“star bus topology”. 

• If the control units are arranged in a circle, this is called: 

“ring bus topology”. 


Examples: 


Linear bus topology 


CAN buses employ the linear bus topology. 

• Benefits: Easy wiring and expansion of the bus 
structures through additional control units. 

• Drawbacks: If too many control units are transmit¬ 
ting on this bus there are problems. The bus struc¬ 
ture may only be loaded to ~30 %. For this reason 
“sub-buses” are often added. 



MOST bus utilizes the ring bus topology. 

• Benefits: Predecessors and successors are defined. 

• Drawbacks: Fuse protection required in case a 
control unit fails. 


Ring bus topology 



ISIS (ISIS: intelligent safety and integration system) on 
the former E65/E66 utilized the star bus topology. 

In the first E65 and E66, the SIM (safety and information 
module) was the central control module in the star. 

• Benefits: High data transmission rates. High security: 
if one control unit fails it does not affect the others. 

• Drawbacks: Complicated wiring. 



Star bus topology 





60 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 






























5. What do “sub-bus”, “master” and “secondary” mean? 

“Sub-buses”, as the name implies, are subordinate buses. Sub-buses are often present 
in CAN buses so that there is not too much data being transmitted via the CAN bus. 

If several control units or components belong to one system, a separate bus is branched 
off for this system. 

The control unit on the data interface to other data busses is often called the “master 
control unit”. The control units within the sub-bus are referred to as “secondary”. 

The amounts of data transmitted between master and secondary control units only 
load the sub-bus, which means that the master/primary bus is not loaded. 

There are several designations for sub-buses such as “Local CAN” or “Private CAN”. 

The names themselves typically indicate that they are subordinate buses. 

There is also a ’’master” and “secondary” on the MOST bus where there is a master 
control unit that manages all the functions and the “secondary” control units only carry 
out functions. 

Also, the BMW diagnosis system functions as the “master”. During the diagnosis proce¬ 
dure all control units in the vehicle are “secondary”: The control units send data to the 
BMW diagnosis system. The BMW diagnosis system is the “Master” during diagnosis. 

6. What does “synchronous and asynchronous” mean in connection with bus 
communication? 

Some communication busses such as byteflight and MOST, combine synchronous and 
asynchronous data transmission so that amounts of data critical for safety can be safely 
transmitted at any time: 

- Synchronous data transmission: the individual control units transmit cyclic 
(regular) messages. 

- Asynchronous data transmission: in addition to synchronous data transmission, 
event-driven messages are also transmitted. 

The advantage of this combination of data transmission is that all control units transmit 
data regularly without overloading the bus (overloading is the possible drawback of just 
having synchronous data transmission). Also, urgent messages can always be sent as 
high priority. 


61 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 



7. What is a wake-up / activation wire? 

The PT-CAN needs an activation wire. Without an activation wire the PT-CAN cannot 
function. The activation wire (terminal KL_15 wake-up - WUP) is partly integrated in the 
ribbon cable for the PT-CAN (3-core ribbon cable). In the E90 the activation wire is also 
partly guided separately and not in the ribbon cable of the PT-CANs. 

8. Why does the PT-CAN have an activation wire on some model series but 
not on others? 

Most vehicles with electrical system BN2000 have an activation wire for PT-CAN 
control units. On these vehicles, the CAS (Car Access System) activates the other 
control units on the PT-CAN with a wake-up signal as soon as terminal KL_15 is 
switched on. Earlier model series had a PT-CAN without activation wire. This is because 
on earlier model series (e.g. E85), each control unit had its own input for terminal KL_15. 
This meant that each control unit was activated via the terminal KL_15 input as soon as 
terminal KL_15 was switched on. A separate activation wire was not necessary. 

On vehicles with electrical system BN2020 an activation wire is still used but not shown 
in the Bus Overview charts. 



Not all bus circuits utilize WUP lines. Please refer to the latest SSP. 

DO NOT rely on the Bus Chart Overview handed in ST401 - BEII as that 
chart does not contain all the detail found in SSP’s. 


9. What is the purpose of the terminating resistors? 

Buses need terminating resistors to prevent reflections from messages. Without termi¬ 
nating resistors, messages and signals are reflected on the data bus. The result is inter¬ 
ference in the transmission of data on the bus with a faulty terminating resistor. The ter¬ 
minating resistors are arranged to suit the data buses. For example: CAN buses employ 
two 120 Q resistors connected in parallel thus yielding a total value of 60 Q. 


Depending on the fitted equipment, the terminating resistors may be in different 
control units.

10. What is the correct procedure to measure the terminating resistors 
in a CAN bus? 

First, it is of paramount importance to turn off all power supplies of the attached CAN 
nodes and make sure all bus activity has stopped. An easy way to do this is to look at 
the CAS push button light. If it is not lit, there is no bus activity and you can measure 
resistance with all of the modules hooked up as they would normally be. 

If the CAS light is lit and won't go out, you most likely have issues that are keeping the 
bus awake, but if you need to measure resistance, you must then disconnect the battery 
“B-” cable and have the charger disconnected as well. Any voltage on the bus while 
attempting a resistance test will result in an incorrect measurement and 
misdiagnosis! 

Also remember that any activity with doors, locking, latches, etc., will reawaken the bus 
and cause an inaccurate resistance measurement. 

Second, measure the DC resistance between CAN_H and CAN_L at the middle and 
ends of the network “1” (see figure on previous page). The nominal value is 60 Q but 
measured values are typically between 50 and 70 Q. The measured values should be 
nearly the same at each point of the bus network. 

If the value is below 50 Q, please check the following: 

• there is no short circuit between CAN_H and CAN_L 

• there are no more than two terminating resistors (each 120 Q) 

• the nodes do not have faulty transceivers. 

If the value is higher than 70 Q, please check the following: 

• there are no open circuits in CAN_H or CAN_L 

• the bus system has two terminating resistors (one at each end) 
and that they are 120 Q each. 

An easy way to know if the CAN bus is “out” is to reference if the 
CAS light is extinguished. If unsure of bus activity, you can discon¬ 
nect the “B-” from the Battery and disconnect the battery charger. 
All “participants” need to be hooked-up. Please refer to the Terminal 
Resistor table found elsewhere in this book. 

11. What do ”K-wire”, ”TxD1” and ”TxD2” mean? 

These 3 designations stand for the following different diagnosis wires: 

K-wire is the official, internationally applicable description for the diagnosis wire. 

Vehicles with electrical system BN2000 have a central gateway and 1 diagnosis wire. 
The diagnosis wire is on the gateway at pin 7 of the diagnosis socket. The diagnosis 
wire connects all control units with the BMW diagnosis system (via the central gateway). 



63 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




A new diagnosis protocol was developed for the electrical system BN2000: BMW Fast 
Protocol - Fast Access for Service and Testing. 

The OBD protocol addresses all control units relevant to emissions. All control units 
that influence the maintaining of exhaust emissions regulations, are emissions-relevant. 
The gateway recognizes scan tools from the OBD protocol. When a scan tool is con¬ 
nected to the diagnosis socket, the gateway transmits the OBD protocol on the 
PT-CAN. Only emissions-relevant control units respond. 

TxDI and TxD2 are data wires for diagnosis on model series without a central gateway 
(data interface). 

• TxDI is the diagnosis wire for all control units on the powertrain that are 
not relevant to emissions. 

• TxD2 is the diagnosis wire for all emissions-relevant control units on the powertrain. 
TxD2 transmits all officially prescribed data to the tester's scan tool with the OBD 
protocol. 

All other control units are diagnosed via the gateway control unit (e.g. instrument cluster). 
Technical background of the two TxD wires was that only the emissions-relevant control 
units are read off via the diagnosis socket. This eliminated the risk of interference on 
other control units. These two wires were bridged in the diagnosis socket on the BMW 
diagnosis system. This allowed the BMW diagnosis system to read off and evaluate both 
TxD wires at the same time. 

12. What is “D-CAN”: Diagnosis-on CAN? 

D-CAN (Diagnosis-on CAN) supersedes the previous diagnosis interface in all parts 
of the world. 

The change was done from the previous protocol because of a new legal requirement in 
the USA that stipulates that all vehicles from Model Year 2008 (MY2008) must be 
equipped with D-CAN. 

D-CAN has a data transmission rate of 500 Kbps and comprises a two (2)-wire cable. 

The terminating resistors for the D-CAN are fitted in the DME/DDE and in the wiring 
harness close to he diagnosis socket. Thus from date of production 03/2007 there are 
no more terminating resistors in the diagnosis socket cap. 

All single wire buses, e.g. LIN/BSD/K-Bus/PA Bus, etc., should be 
treated the same way while diagnosing. Please refer to the laminated 
Bus Specification Overview Table for specs on single wire buses. 



64 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




13. What does “BSD” mean: bit-serial data interface? 

BSD refers to “Bit-Serial Data interface” because the bits are not transmitted and 
received in parallel but rather in series. 

Some examples of BSD usage include DME communication with the following 
components.: 

• Alternator voltage regulation (varies according to version, e.g. E90) 

• Intelligent Battery Sensor (depending on model series, e.g. E90) 

• Electrical coolant pump (depending on variant, e.g. E90 w/N52) 

The following data is interchanged between the DME/DDE and the connected 
components: 

• Functional requirements from the DME/DDE to the components 

• Identification data of the components to the DME/DDE 

• Operating values of the components and their functions to the DME/DDE 

• Fault messages of the components to the DME/DDE

14. Main characteristics of single wire buses i.e. CAS-Bus, LIN, K-Bus 
protocol, CA-Bus, BSD, etc. 

All of our vehicle’s single wire buses should be treated the same way with regards to 
diagnosis in the workshop. Even though the buses may have some design differences, 
the process for diagnosis will remain the same and this will make for less confusion. 

Single wire buses (Secondary buses) are designed with a Master controller (Master 
modules) that supports the bus voltage. Master modules are located on Primary buses 
(you can identify them in the short test on ISTA) and you can communicate with them 
via diagnosis request, i.e. K-CAN I and II, PT CAN etc. The remaining control modules 
that subscribe to the bus are considered secondary modules and are directed and 
diagnosed through the Master. The secondary modules will not support any bus 
communication without the Master. 

Like the Primary buses, the voltages used on the Single Wire buses are binary in design 
and have to meet a voltage value to express either Binary 1 or 0. Voltage above the 
9 volt level equals binary 0 (generally we see the voltage around 12.6 volts). When the 
module communication wants to change to binary 1, then the voltage will pull low to 
around 900 mV-1100 mV (0.9 volts - 1.1.volts). Voltages that do not meet these values 
are not compliant. 

Do not use a multi-meter to diagnose the bus authenticity since 
the meter displays average voltages, instead use an approved 
Oscilloscope. 



Example of message for single wire buses (secondary control units) 
structure on LIN-bus 

The identifier byte contains the following information: 

• Address of the secondary control unit 

• Message length 

• Two bits for data safeguarding 

The identifier determines whether the master sends data to the secondary control unit 
or whether it expects an answer from the slave. The main body contains the message 
for the secondary control unit. The checksum is located at the end of the message. 

The checksum ensures effective data safeguarding during transmission. The checksum 
is created by the master via the data bytes and is attached at the end of the 
message.The current messages are transmitted cyclically by the LIN-bus master. 

The LIN-bus secondaries wait for commands from the LIN-bus master and communicate 
with it only on request.

15. What is “FlexRay”: FlexRay bus system? 

FlexRay is a new communication system designed to meet the heightened demands of 
the future networking of current and future functions in the vehicle. Growing technical 
demands on a communication system for networking control units in the vehicle and 
recognition of the fact that an open solution that can be standardized is desirable for 
infrastructure systems - these were the motives for developing FlexRay. 

The FlexRay consortium was founded to develop FlexRay. This included nearly all major 
automobile manufacturers and suppliers worldwide, plus semiconductor manufacturers 
and systems experts for the field of communications technology. 

FlexRay offers an extremely efficient, real time data transfer between the electrical an 
mechatronic components of the vehicle. With a data transfer rate of 10 Mbps, FlexRay 
is significantly faster than the data buses employed in the areas of body and 
powertrain/suspension on today’s vehicles.

Main Bus Systems Overview 

The electronic control units in the vehicle are connected to one another via a network. 

In this system network, the central gateway module plays a decisive role. The central 
gateway module is responsible for ensuring that information is transferred from one 
bus system to another bus system. 

In BN2020 vehicles, the engine control system and chassis control system are linked via 
the PT-CAN (or PT-CAN2) and the FlexRay bus system to the ZGM. The control units of 
the general vehicle electrical system are connected via the K-CAN and the K-CAN2. 

For most control units in the area of information and communication technology, the 
MOST is available as an information carrier. 

The vehicle diagnosis communicates across the D-CAN. The vehicle is programmed / 
encoded via the Ethernet access. The overall network consists of various bus systems 
that ensure communication between the individual control units. 

In principle, two groups of bus systems are distinguished:

also linked to the other bus systems across the central 
gateway module. A number of control units in the 
K-CAN have a LIN bus as sub-bus. 

The K-CAN has a data transfer rate of 100 Kbps and 
consists of two twisted wires. 



The K-CAN has the possibility to be 
operated as a single-wire bus in the 
event of errors.

Body CAN2, K-CAN2, K-CAN3 

The K-CAN2 is responsible for communication of the

Only the central gateway module can implement data exchange 
between the MOST bus and other bus systems. The Car 
Information Computer functions as master control unit; the gate¬ 
way to the remaining bus system is the central gateway module.

ICM-CAN 

Despite the fact that the PT-CAN and F-CAN work at a high bit rate 
of 500 Kbps, they would have been overloaded by the signals from 
the ICM and QMVH control units. For this reason, the ICM-CAN was 
introduced. 

The ICM coordinates longitudinal and lateral dynamic control functions, 
which include the familiar Active Steering and the Dynamic Performance 
Control [with QMVH], currently available in the E71 and E70M/E71M 




QMVH 


ICM-CAN 
on F30 


The ICM-CAN is a two-wire bus on which data is transmitted at 
500 Kbps. The two terminating resistors, each with 120 Q, are located 
in the ICM and QMVH control units. 


FlexRay 

With a maximum data transfer rate of 10 Mbps per 
channel, FlexRay is significantly faster than the data buses 
employed so far in the areas of body and powertrain/sus¬ 
pension in motor vehicles. The central gateway module 
sets up the link between the various bus systems and the 
FlexRay. Depending on the fitted equipment in the vehi¬ 
cle, the ZGM has one or two so-called star couplers, each 
with four bus drivers. 


ZGM

Hw.=lo 



FlexRay on F30 


The bus drivers forward the data of the control units across the communication con¬ 
troller to the central gateway module (ZGM). The deterministic data interchange ensures 
that each message is transferred in the time-controlled section in real time. Real time 
means that the transmission takes place in a specified time. 


Possible Faults in Bus Systems 

If faults occur in the communication framework, fault entries are created in the control 
units involved. Here, a distinction can normally be made between line faults and logical 
faults such as missing messages. 



The following fault causes can lead to bus faults: 

• Short circuit of a bus line 

• Interruption of a bus line (open circuit) 

• Fault in a gateway 

• Fault in the transmitter or receiver of a control unit

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 


























This procedure evaluates the fault entries as a whole. The evaluation of the combination 
of existing fault entries provides the most probable fault cause. 

If there has been an undervoltage situation in the vehicle, bus faults can also (erroneous¬ 
ly) be entered. Check whether an undervoltage fault is stored in more than one control 
unit. If this is the case, there is no further evaluation of the bus faults; the fault cause can 
be found in the area of the voltage supply. 

It should be borne in mind that a fault cause generally causes 
a number of fault entries in different control units.

Bus Diagnosis 


Introduction 

In the vehicles of today, components and control 
units are networked by means of data buses. Data 
buses are capable of transmitting messages with sig¬ 
nals where the connected control units only read off 
those messages and signals that are of relevance to 
their operation. 



The data bus that is used the most is the CAN data bus (CAN: Controller Area Network). 
There are several CAN buses with different data transfer rates in each vehicle. For exam¬ 
ple, the PT-CAN has a fast data transfer rate, the K-CAN a slower data transfer rate. 

A fiber-optic cable bus is used for navigation and entertainment: the MOST bus (“Media 
Oriented System Transport”). 

The following options are available for locating faults in data buses and in control units: 

• Test module for diagnosing CAN buses in the diagnostic system: Bus system 
analysis. The procedure for opening the diagnostic module in the ISTA (Integrated 
Service Technical Application) diagnosis system is as follows: 


Activities > Function structure > 03 Body > System analyses > CAN functions > 
System analysis. 


The test module is automatically entered in the test schedule if at least one mes¬ 
sage error (message missing) has been recorded. 

• Checking the terminating resistors: Checking the terminating resistors can also be 
useful for bus diagnosis. 

• Procedure for diagnosis on the MOST buses: MOST system analysis. The proce¬ 
dure for opening the test module in the ISTA diagnosis system is as follows: 

Activities > Function structure > 03 Body > Audio, video, telephone, navigation 
(MOST ring) > MOST functions > MOST system analysis.

Bus System Analysis 

The bus system analysis narrows down the cause of intermittently occurring faults in the 
area of the data buses and control units. 

m All cases where a data bus or control unit only fails temporarily (i.e. 
/|\ intermittently) are difficult for diagnosis. In such cases, the entries in 
v * ) the control units' fault memories do not point unambiguously to an 
intermittent failure of a particular data bus or control unit. 


Intermittent failure of a particular data bus or control unit causes many different fault 
memory entries in several control units. The system analysis routine processes all of 
these DTC fault code entries (message missing) for all control units, in this process it 
employs a probability calculation to localize the fault cause within a specific sector. 

If a data bus fails completely and permanently, the affected control units are no longer 
available for diagnosis. The fault is thus “easy” to locate.

FlexRay* = In the same way as most bus systems, resistors for termination (as bus termination) are also used at 
both ends of the data lines on the FlexRay to prevent reflections on the lines. If only one control unit is 
connected to a bus driver (e.g. SZL to the bus driver BDO), the connections on the bus driver and on 
the control unit are fitted with a terminal resistor. This type of connection at the central gateway module 
is called "end node termination". If the connection at the control unit is not the physical finish node (e.g. 
DSC, ICM and DME at the bus driver BD2), it is referred to as a FlexRay transmission and forwarding 
line. In this case, both components must be terminated at the ends of each bus path. 

For further information regarding the FlexRay refer to ST401 Body Electronics II training information avail¬ 
able on TIS and ICP.

CAN Bus Diagnosis 


In order to more easily diagnose the CAN bus it is important to understand some key 
elements of its principles of operation. The CAN (Controller Area Network) bus system 
is a linear bus system that is characterized by the following features: 

• Signals are broadcast in both directions. 

• All bus users receive a message. Each bus user decides whether to process the 
message or not. 

• Additional bus users can be added by connecting them in parallel. 

• The bus system constitutes a multimaster system which means that each bus 
user can be a Master or a Secondary Control Module depending on whether 

it is connected as a transmitter or receiver. 

• The transmission medium is a two-wire twisted connection. The cores are 
designated CAN Low and CAN High. 

In principle, each bus user can use the bus to communicate with all other bus users. 
An access mechanism controls data exchange on the bus. The main differences 
between the K-CAN (Body CAN) bus, the PT-CAN (Powertrain CAN) bus and the 
F-CAN (Chassis CAN) bus are detailed below:

Single-wire operation possible. 

PT-CAN

Single-wire operation NOT possible. 

F-CAN

What is a Master Control Module? 

A master control module is the active communicating node, i.e. the one that initiates 
communication. The master control module is in control of the bus and manages com¬ 
munication. The master can send messages to the passive bus users (secondary control 
modules) in the bus system and can receive messages from them on reguest. 

What is a Secondary Control Module? 

A secondary control module is a passive communicating node. This type of control 
module is instructed to receive and send data. 

What is a Multimaster System? 

A multimaster system is one in which all communication nodes can take on the role of 
master or secondary control module at a particular time, this is, all nodes connected to 
a CAN network are able to “talk” and “listen” to each other. 


80 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




Testing Instructions 

There are two main procedures in order to test a CAN network. They are: 

• Voltage test (oscilloscope). For this test it is paramount that the battery 
is connected and the ignition is switched on i.e. KL_15 on. 

• Resistance measurement. Prior to the resistance measurement, the test compo¬ 
nent must be de-energized. The battery must be disconnected to ensure this con¬ 
dition. Please wait around 3 minutes until all system condensers have discharged. 

Even though a simple voltage test with a DVOM could be done, such 
/ | \ test would not suffice as the DVOM only indicates the average volt- 
\ * ') age in the bus line. In other words, this is not a conclusive measure¬ 
ment to determine if the bus is communicating correctly or not! 


CAN-bus not Operative 

If the K-CAN or PT-CAN data bus is not working, there may be a short circuit or open 
circuit on the CAN_L / CAN_H line. Alternatively, a control module might be faulty. 

The following procedure is recommended to localize the cause of the fault: 

1. Disconnect the bus users from the CAN bus one after the other until the cause 
of the fault (control module “X”) is found. 

2. Check the lines of control module “X” for a short/open circuit. 

3. If possible, check control module “X” itself. 

4. However, this procedure only leads to success if a tap line from a control module 
to the CAN bus has a short circuit. If a line in the CAN bus itself has a short circuit, 
the wiring harness must be checked. 


81 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




K-CAN, PT-CAN and F-CAN Oscilloscope Measurement 

In order to obtain a clear idea of whether the CAN bus is functioning correctly, you must 
be able to observe activity on the bus. This does not mean that you need to analyze the 
individual bits or learn how to decode the binary CAN protocol; you simply need to 
observe whether or not the CAN bus is working/communicating. This is why we utilize 
the oscilloscope test as it can help us determine whether the bus is operating without 
faults. 

When you measure the voltage between the CAN Low line (or CAN High line) and the 
circuit ground, you should receive a rectangle-like signal in the following voltage ranges: 


K-CAN 



These values are approximate values and can 
vary by a few hundred milli-volts [mV] 
depending on the bus load. Oscilloscope set¬

Terminating Resistor Testing 

From an electrical point of view, a current carrying conductor always has an ohmic, 
inductive and capacitive resistance. When transmitting data from point "A" to point "B", 
the total sum of these resistances has an effect on data transmission. The higher the 
transmission frequency, the more effective the inductive and capacitive resistance. 
Ultimately, it is possible that a signal, which is no longer identifiable, is received at the 
end of the transmission line. For this reason, the line is "adapted" by terminating resis¬ 
tors, ensuring the original signal is retained. 

Inductive resistance occurs, for example, as the result of the coil effect in the line. 
Capacitive resistance occurs, for example, by installing the line parallel to the vehicle 
body. 

The terminating resistors used in a bus system vary. They generally depend on the 
following parameters: 

• Frequency of data transmission on the bus system. 

• Inductive or capacitive load on the transmission path. 

• Cable length for data transmission. 

The longer the line, the greater the inductive component of the line. The control units 
are divided into basic control units and other control units. The resistance value deter¬ 
mines this division. 

Terminating resistors are used to ensure exact signal progression in the bus systems. 
These terminating resistors are located in the control units of the bus systems. 


K-CAN terminating resistor 

No defined resistance test can be carried out on the K-CAN data bus as the resistance 
varies depending on the internal switching logic of the control modules. The Values of 
the terminating resistors on the KCAN varies from 800-12,0000, so this test is of little 
value for diagnosis.

PT-CAN, F-CAN terminating resistor 

In order to prevent signal reflection, two (2) terminal resistors (120 Q each) are incorpo¬ 
rated into two (2) CAN bus communicating nodes, at the farthest ends of any fast CAN 
network, i.e. 500 Kbps. The two terminal resistors are connected in parallel and form an 
equivalent resistance of 60 Q. When the supply voltage is switched off, this equivalent 
resistance can be measured between the data lines (CAN_L and CAN_H). 

In addition, the individual resistors can be tested independently. For this procedure 
the communicating node must be disconnected from the network. Then measure 
the resistance on the connector between the CAN Low and CAN High lines.

Inspection procedure for resistance test (Fast CAN i.e. 500 Kbps) 

1. The CAN bus must be de-energized. 

2. No other testing equipment must be in use (connected in parallel). 

3. The measurement is taken between the CAN Low and CAN High lines. 

4. The actual values may differ from the setpoint values by a few ohms. 

The nominal value for the equivalent resistance is 60 Q but measured values are typically 
between 50 and 70 Q. The measured values should be nearly the same at each point of 
the bus network. 

If the value is below 50 Q, please check the following: 

• there is no short circuit between CAN_H and CAN_L 

• there are no more than two terminating resistors (each 120 Q) 

• the nodes do not have faulty transceivers 

If the value is higher than 70 Q, please check the following: 

• there are no open circuits in CAN_H or CAN_L 

• the bus system has two terminating resistors (one at each end) 
and that they are 120 Q each 



Not all vehicles have a terminating resistor on the CAN bus. Use the 
wiring diagram to check whether the connected vehicle has a termi¬ 
nating resistor. There is also a table with the terminating resistors 
contained elsewhere in this training manual. 



You can reference the Oscilloscope Library at the end of this 
Training Manual.

FlexRay Diagnosis 

FlexRay is a relatively new communication system which aims at providing reliable and 
efficient data transmission with real-time capabilities between the electrical and mecha- 
tronic components for the purpose of interconnecting innovative functions in motor 
vehicles, both today and in the future. 

FlexRay provides an efficient protocol for real-time data transmission in distributed 
systems as used in motor vehicles. 

With a data transmission rate of 10 Mbits/s, the FlexRay is distinctly faster than the 
data buses used in the area of the chassis, drive train and suspension of today's 
motor vehicles. 

FlexRay supports not only the higher bandwidth but also deterministic data interchange; 
its configuration is error-tolerant. This means that even after failure of individual compo¬ 
nents, reliable continued operation of the remaining communication systems is enabled. 
The central gateway module (ZGM) sets up the link between the various bus systems 
and the FlexRay. 

What are the advantages of FlexRay? 

• High bandwidth (10 Mbits/s compared to 0.5 Mbits/s of the CAN) 

• Deterministic (= real-time capabilities) data transmission 

• Reliable data communication 

• Supports system integration 

• Standard in automotive industry 



86 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 







































How is FlexRay connected? 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, the central gateway module (ZGM) is equipped 
with two (2) star couplers each with four (4) bus drivers. The bus drivers forward the data 
of the control modules via the communication controller to the central gateway module 
(ZGM). Depending on the type of termination, the FlexRay control modules are connected 
to these bus drivers in two different ways. Terminal resistors are used on both ends of 
the data lines on the FlexRay to prevent reflections. If only one control module is con¬ 
nected to a bus driver (e.g. SZL on partial bus system 0, see wiring diagram), the con¬ 
nections at the bus driver and at the control module are each fitted with a terminal resis¬ 
tor. If the connection to the control module is not the physical end-node (e.g. DSC, ICM 
and DME on the 2nd partial bus system): The two components must be terminated at 
the ends of the respective paths with terminating resistors.

Wake-up and Sleep Characteristics 

The control units on the FlexRay can be woken by a bus signal. Despite this, the activa¬ 
tion of most control units occurs on the FlexRay via an additional wake-up line from the 
Car Access System (CAS). The wakeup line has the same function as the wake-up line 
(terminal 15 WUP) used to date in the PT-CAN. The signal path corresponds to the sig¬ 
nal path of the PT-CAN. 

Synchronization 

To implement synchronous execution of individual functions in networked control mod¬ 
ules, a common time base is necessary. As all the control modules work internally with 
their own clock generator, time synchronization must take place via the bus. When start¬ 
ing up the Central Gateway Module, the control modules (ZGM, DSC, ICM and 
DME/DDE) operate as synchronization nodes. 

For fault-free synchronization of the FlexRay bus system, communication from ZGM to 
at least two (2) of the control modules is reguired. If e.g. the DSC has failed, the control 
modules ICM and DME/DDE are used as synchronization nodes. If the FlexRay is faulty, 
the bus lines of the control modules ZGM, ICM, DSC and DME/DDE must be checked. 

Fault Handling 

For faults on the bus system (e.g. short circuit to B+ or short circuit to ground) or at the 
control modules on the FlexRay itself, individual control modules or entire paths from the 
bus communication can be excluded. Not included in this is the path with the four (4) 
authorized control modules to perform wake up function on the FlexRay: 

• ZGM 

• DME/DDE 

• DSC 

• ICM 

No engine start is possible if an interruption of the communication between the control 
modules occurs. 

Wiring 

The wiring of the FlexRay bus system is designed as two-wire, twisted cable (partially 
clad). Some of the terminal resistors are located in the central gateway module and in 
the user devices.

Measurements on the FlexRay 

The various termination options mean that misinterpretations of the measurement 
results can occur. Measuring the resistance of the FlexRay lines cannot provide a 100% 
deduction in terms of the system wiring. In the case of damage such as pinching or con¬ 
nector corrosion, the resistance value may be within the tolerance when the system is 
static. 

In dynamic mode, however, electrical influences can cause increased surge resistance, 
resulting in data transmission problems. 

It is possible to repair the FlexRay bus. If damaged, the cables can be connected using 
conventional cable connectors. Special requirements, however, must be observed when 
reinstalling the system. 

The wiring of the FlexRay system consists of twisted lines. Where possible, this twisting 
should not be altered during repairs. Repaired areas with stripped insulation must be 
sealed again with shrink-fit tubing. Moisture can affect the surge resistance and there 
fore the efficiency of the bus system. 

For resistance measurement in the FlexRay, be sure to observe the 
vehicle wiring diagram!

Wiring Diagrams 


Introduction 


The Wiring Diagrams (SSP) divide the vehicle electrical system into individual circuits. 
Components which interact with that circuit are shown on the same schematic. 


In order to provide a standard for the way in which a wiring diagram is written and read, 
there are general rules that apply. Components are drawn in such a way that their gen¬ 
eral layout and function are self-explanatory. They are arranged on the page so that the 
current path can be followed from positive (top) to negative (bottom). 


General Guidelines 


Wiring Diagram “SSP-SP0000020123 LH Rear Seatback Adjustment” 

will be used as an example. 


To obtain more information on 
a component or signal select 
any blue hotbox on the wiring 
diagram (additional information 
should appear to the right of 
the SSP, such as EBO, STA, 
PIB, etc.). It is also helpful to 
press the Document button, 
on the lower left of the naviga¬ 
tion bar on ISTA, after select¬ 
ing a component’s blue hot¬ 
box. This will show you all rele¬ 
vant SSP regarding the com¬ 
ponent you just selected.

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 



































































The ability to measure voltage, current flow, and resistance is important in the diagnosing 
of electrical problems. Without the results of these measurements troubleshooting in 
an electrical system is a futile process. 

The instrument most commonly used to make electrical measurements is called the 
Digital Voltage-Ohm Meter (DVOM). 


Basic DVOM’s are capable of measuring: 

• 

AC Voltage 

• DC Voltage 

• 

Millivolts 

• Resistance 

• 

Conductance 

• Capacitance 

• 

Continuity 

• Diode Test 

• 

Amps/Milliamps 

• Microamps 

Advanced DVOM’s add: 


• 

Frequency 

• RPM 

• 

Duty Cycle 

• Pulse Width 


Temperature 



The DVOM provides for a method of accurate measurements. 

Even though accurate measurements are the key to electrical 
diagnosis, the following four factors determine the effectiveness of the measurements: 

• Accuracy of the measuring instrument. 

• Correct installation in the circuit of the measuring instrument. 

• Ability of the Technician to read the instrument. 

• Skill of the Technician in interpreting the results. 

As it is clearly seen, only one of the factors depends on the DVOM (e.g. accuracy), the 
rest will always depend on the ability of the Technician to read and interpret the results, 


Choosing a DVOM 

A good choice of a DVOM is the IMIB, as the measuring system of each contains a 
highly accurate DVOM. 

Choosing a handheld DVOM from a reputable manufacturer, however, leaves the shop 
IMIB free to perform other tasks that a DVOM can not do (e.g. Retrieval of fault codes, 
Oscilloscope, etc.). 


103 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 






In choosing a DVOM several factors need to be considered, one of which is Impedance. 

Impedance is the combined resistance to current created by the resistance, capacitance 
and inductance of the meter. Impedance is measured in ‘Ohms per Volt’. 

Meters with the highest ‘Ohms per Volt’ impedance are the most accurate. 

More importantly using a meter with high impedance will not cause damage 
to sensitive electronic circuitry. 

When a Meter is connected across a circuit to measure voltage, it must be connected in 
parallel. This adds parallel resistance. The total resistance in a parallel circuit is less than 
the lowest resistance in that circuit (Ohms Law). Using a Meter with low impedance will 
reduce the total resistance of the circuit and allow more current to flow. 

A meter with low impedance can draw enough current to cause inaccurate measure¬ 
ment, voltage drops or damage sensitive electronic circuit boards. A high impedance 
meter will draw little current and insure accurate readings. 



Using older type meters with low impedance values (20,000 to 
30,000 ohms-per-volt) can damage modern electronic circuits 
and components or give inaccurate readings. 


Test lights should be avoided for the same reason. They lower the total resistance of the 
circuit and cause increased current flow. 

Other factors in choosing the proper DVOM are: 

• Cost 

• Features 

Basic DVOM’s are available reasonably priced. These basic models may be more than 
sufficient for use in BMW Centers, given the availability of the IMIB for advanced mea¬ 
surement and scope functions. 

Advanced features and price go hand in hand. The more features added the higher the 
cost. Some of those features may be worth the increase in cost (e.g. frequency, duty 
cycle and pulse width). Other features may not (e.g. oscilloscope, graphing). 

Choose a DVOM wisely based on personal preference and cost. Like many other tools it 
is valuable in the diagnosis and repair of BMW’s. Experience has shown if the technician 
is not comfortable with the DVOM or confident in the results of the measurements, the 
DVOM will not be used. 

Considering the technology in BMW automobiles, diagnosing with a quality DVOM cer¬ 
tainly makes repairing the problem correctly and expediently a more manageable task.

While most displays of DVOM’s are standard (i.e. mV means millivolt, mA means mil- 
liamp) the display or symbol for infinity or open circuit can be confusing. A display of OQ 
indicates no or little resistance. It means the circuit or portion of the circuit being mea¬ 
sured has continuity or is complete. A reading of OL means the circuit is open or not 
complete, the resistance is said to be “INFINITY”. Some meters may use the symbol B 
for Infinity. Be aware of which reading the meter being used will give for infinity or open 
circuit.

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 






















Using the DVOM 

Voltage Testing 

The voltmeter (DVOM) must be connected in parallel with the load or circuit. 

The DVOM has a high resistance and taps off a small amount of current. 

A voltmeter must be used with the current on and with the correct polarity. 

The red lead should be connected to the B+ side of the circuit and the black 
lead to the B- side of the circuit. 

If the leads are reversed the reading will be a negative number. 

• Select proper function and range of DVOM. 

• Connect (-) lead of meter to battery B- or known good ground. 

• Connect (+) lead of meter to test circuit. 


DVOM will indicate supply or available voltage at that point. 



Measure at different points checking for 
change or interruption in the voltage supply. 


115 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 




























Amperage Testing 

To measure amperage the meter must be installed in series in the circuit. The current 
flow of the circuit must flow through the meter itself. 

Current must be flowing in the circuit. 

Installing the meter in parallel with the circuit may cause damage to the meter, because 
of the increased current flow in the circuit, due to the low resistance in the meter. 

Caution: Most ampere meters or DVOM’s are rated for no more than 10 amps. Current 
flow above 10 amps will damage the internal fuse of the DVOM and render it unable to 
measure amperage. 

• Select proper function of DVOM and move leads to proper position. 

• Connect meter in series with (+) lead on the B+ side of the circuit. 

• Connect (-) lead of meter to complete circuit. 

DVOM will indicate current flow (Amps) through circuit. 


Typical Application of 
Amperage Testing 

• Proper Component Operation 
(Correct Current Draw). 

• Parasitic Draw Testing. 


Ensure meter is capable of handling current flow. 



116 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 















Resistance Testing 


When set for resistance testing (Ohms) the DVOM must never be connected in a live 
circuit. 

The component or portion of a circuit being measured, must be isolated from the power 
source. 


Most modern day DVOM’s are self ranging when set to measure resistance, so the 
meter can not be damaged by out of range measurements. 

The test leads may be used without regard for polarity, unless the circuit contains 
a diode. 


The DVOM functions by placing a very small amount of current on the circuit being 
tested, the red lead must be placed on the anode side of the diode. 

• Select correct function and range (Most meters are self ranging in this function), 

• Disconnect power to circuit. 

• Disconnect any circuit wired in parallel with circuit being tested. 

• Connect test leads. 


DVOM will indicate resistance 
(Ohms) of component or circuit 
being tested. 


Typical Application of 
Resistance Testing

Continuity Testing 

The DVOM uses its own internal power supply to test the continuity of the circuit. 

The DVOM must never be connected in a live circuit. Any circuits wired in parallel with 
the circuit being tested must also be disconnected. 

Continuity testing verifies that circuit connections are intact. The continuity mode is 
extremely fast and is used to detect either shorts or opens that last as little as 1 ms. 

When a change is detected the beeper tone is stretched to last at least 1/4 second so 
both shorts and opens can be audibly detected. 

This is a valuable troubleshooting aid when diagnosing intermittent faults associated with 
wiring, connections, switches and other components of the circuit. 

• Select correct function and range of DVOM. 

• Disconnect power to the circuit. 

• Disconnect any circuits wired in parallel. 

• Connect DVOM leads to the circuit to be tested. 

DVOM display will indicate continuity of circuit. 


Typical Application of Continuity Testing 

• Circuit Continuity. 

• Intermittent Wiring Harness Faults. 


There must be NO current available to the 
circuit during the continuity test. 




118 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 

























Voltage Drop Testing 

Voltage Drop Tests determine the resistance of an active circuit, a circuit with current 
flowing. 

Voltage drop tests are preferred over simple resistance measurements because the 
power source is not removed from the circuit. 

By measuring the voltage on both sides of a load, the amount of voltage consumed by 
the load is measured. 

The voltage drops of each part of a series circuit added together must equal the power 
supply for that circuit while it is active. 

• Select proper function and range of DVOM. 

• Connect (+) lead to the “B+” side of the circuit or component being tested. 

• Connect (-) lead to the “B-” side of the circuit or component. 

DVOM display will indicate the voltage drop in the circuit tested between the 
DVOM leads. 



Typical Application of Voltage 
Drop Testing 

• Determine proper component 
operation. 

• Active circuit continuity 

• Active circuit resistance. 


As a “Dynamic” test with the circuit opera¬ 
tional, a voltage drop in any non-resistive part 
of the circuit indicates a fault in the circuit.

The measuring cables and sensors used with the Measurement Interface Box (MIB) 
to date, can for the most part, continue to be used. For oscilloscope measurements, 
standard measuring cables are used. These cables can also be used for voltage 
measurements. 

If a measurement is carried out during a diagnostic procedure, the result determined by 
the Integrated Measurement Interface Box is automatically evaluated in the diagnostics 
program and therefore influences the next diagnostics stage. In addition to its use in 
diagnostic procedures, the Integrated Measurement Interface Box can also double as 
a stand-alone and portable digital multimeter. 

The measured values are shown on the display screen. It is possible to measure voltage, 
current, pressure and resistance. Temperature and frequency, however, can only be 
measured as part of diagnostics, i.e. in the procedures of the Integrated Service 
Technical Application. Measured values are not displayed on the display screen if the 
Integrated Measurement Interface Box is being controlled by the Integrated Service 
Technical Application. 

The results are displayed in the Integrated Service Technical Application under 
"Measuring equipment". Registration and configuration (e.g. of the display language) 
is carried out using the Workshop System Management. Software updates are similarly 
managed using the Workshop System Management and are implemented automatically 
when necessary. 

Other important features include: 

• Hard drive capacity: 20 GB 

• RAM: 512 MB 

• Rechargeable battery life: Up to 3 hours 

• Connection to workshop network by: 

- Cable 

- Wireless

The Integrated Measurement Interface Box also has a USB interface, which will be used 
for vehicle diagnostics in the future.

Multimeter 

The "Multimeter" tab contains display and control elements for two multimeters that are 
separately displayed in the content range, separated into two boxes. Besides individual 
measurements, the device also supports parallel measurement via Probe 1 and Probe 2 
for resistance, direct/alternating voltage, direct/alternating current, as well as the diode 
test. Furthermore, parallel measurements with Probe 1 or 2, as well as a sensor (kV 
clip/RZV cable [resting voltage cable], clip-on ammeter, pressure sensor, or temperature 
sensor), are possible. 

Each multimeter consists of a display area (left) and a settings area (right). With the "Quit 
measuring devices" button in the action line, you can return to the "Measuring devices" tab.

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 






















































































Display Range 

The display area shows the measured value with its physical unit of measurement 
highlighted in color. The measured values of Multimeter 1 (connected with Probe 1 by 
default) are displayed in green; Multimeter 2 (connected with probe 2 by default) displays 
measured values in red. 

Under the display area, there are two buttons with the following functions: 

0 MIN/MAX: If you click this button, the two limit values are shown at the bottom left 

of the display window. "MIN" corresponds to the lowest value in the peri¬ 
od of measurement, e.g. "Imin = 6 A". "MAX" shows the highest value, 
e.g. "Imax = 7 A". 

0 Freeze-frame: This function "freezes" the measurement; the last measurement is 

thus retained. You can also trigger the freeze-frame function at the 
probe and then read the value at the tester. If you click the button 
a second time, the measured values continue to be displayed. 


Range 

The setting range is located at the bottom right of the mask, divided into an area for 
Multimeter 1 (top) and Multimeter 2 (bottom). At the top, there are six buttons for select¬ 
ing a measurement source (probes and sensors). Under these are the "Mode" zones for 
setting the measurement type and "Range" for setting the measurement range. 

Source (measurement source) 

The following measurement sources are used: 

• Probe 1: for resistors, direct/alternating voltage, direct/alternating current, 

diode tests. 

• Probe 2: for resistors, direct/alternating voltage, direct/alternating current, 

diode tests. 

• kV clip/RZV cable: for high voltage measurements in ignition systems. 

• Clip-on ammeter: for direct and alternating current. 

• Pressure sensor: for pressure measurements, e.g. cylinder 1 compression. 

• Temperature sensor: for temperature measurements in liguids, e.g. oil temperature. 
After the source has been selected, the button will be displayed in the color of the mask. 


129 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 



Mode 

The possible settings change according to the selected source. After selection of a 
mode, e.g. "DC V", it is highlighted in the color of the mask. 

The abbreviations are defined below: 

• Q : Resistor measurement 

• AC V: Alternating voltage measurement 

• DC V: Direct voltage measurement 

• AC A: Alternating current measurement 

• DC A: Direct current measurement 

• -to- : Diode test 


Range 

The range changes according to the source. The measuring device will automatically be 
set to the highest measurement range by default; however, you can manually adjust it if 
required. 


® lf the displayed measurement value lies outside the manually 
selected range, the display changes to "++++" or "- 


130

Graph display 


Depending on the application, a trigger mark, two cursors and a progress bar on the top 
edge will appear in the graph plot. 

So that you can distinguish between curves and correctly assign their settings, the curve 
from Channel 1 (CHI) is green and the curve from Channel 2 (CH2) is red. Cursors, trig¬ 
ger marks and progress bars are white. 

The frequency of graph updates depends on the sampling rate set on the oscilloscope. 

The following presets apply for individual areas: 

• Sampling rate < 100 s: Time interval 10 ms. 

• 100 s < sampling rate < 1 s: Time interval 300 ms. 

• Sampling rate > 1 s: Record mode (Record). The curve progresses in linear 
steps of approx. 4 pixels from right to left and is recorded at the same time.

Cursor and Display Settings 

The "Cursor" settings group contains the following buttons: 

0 CHI, CH2: When clicking and locking a button, the two cursors will appear in the sec¬ 
ond and eighth grid line of the graph display for the respective curve (reference and dif¬ 
ference). The cursors can only be displayed for one channel respectively: For example, 
if you lock the "CH2" button, then the "CHI" button will be simultaneously unlocked. 

If you click the same button once more, the measuring cursors will be faded out again. 
You can move the reference cursor along the x-axis with the two reference arrow keys 
and the differential cursor by using the differential arrow keys. The cursors move pixel by 
pixel; their speed increases the longer you hold the arrow key down. As soon as a cursor 
reaches the edge of a measurement curve, the respective arrow key can no longer be 
operated. 

0 Coupled: is activated only if one of the "CHI" or "CH2" buttons, is active. If the 
"Coupled" button is locked, then the differential cursor moves when the differential cur¬ 
sor is displaced, maintaining constant spacing. With the differential arrow keys, you can 
continue to displace the differential cursor separately. If you hide the cursor for one 
channel and later show it again (cursor key locked), the "Coupled" button adopts the 
most recently displayed state.

The following applications are linked with the cursor function: 

• Measuring curves: The oscilloscope determines the following points 
and shows the values in the measured value display: 

• Intersection of reference cursor with the curve ("Ref.Cur") 

• Interface of differential cursor with the curve ("Diff.Cur") 

• Voltage difference between the reference and differential cursor ("Cur") 

• Output of Set values: When you select the "CHI" or "CH2" button in the 
cursor settings group 

The following counter values are entered into the measured value display: 

• Period ("t") 

• Frequency ("1/t") 

• Sample ratio of selected channel ("t/T") 

• Time lag between reference and differential cursor ("t"). 

• Zooming compresses the curves. In compressed mode, you can 
select and zoom in on a curve section. 



136 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 





























































































































































The "Display" settings group contains the following buttons: 

0 Log: logarithmic scaling on/off, as default y-values are presented in linear fashion. 

When clicking and locking the "Log" button , the y-axis switches to logarithmic scaling in 
value ranges up to 4 groups of 10. Negative measurements are zeroed in the logarithmic 
display. Clicking the button a second time switches back to linear scaling. 

0 Record: record mode on/off. When clicking and locking the "Record" button, the 
record mode will be started. The process can be interrupted by once again clicking on 
the "Record" button. The record mode is automatically stopped in the "Single" trigger 
mode if a trigger event occurs (trigger level, ramp). All settings for the "Channel", "Time" 
and "Trigger" groups are locked. The record mode is only accessible if the "Compress" 
button is not locked. 

0 Compress: scales the x-axis over the entire curve. When clicking and locking the 
"Compress" button, the x-axis is scaled so that the entire and most recently recorded 
curve can be shown in the measured graph display. The "Record" button and those for 
the trigger mode (Auto, Normal, Single) are deactivated. The "Compress" button can 
only be clicked after a curve has been recorded. Mark a section of the compressed curve 
(either Channel 1 or 2) with the reference and differential cursor. Click the "Compress" 
button. The oscilloscope zooms in on the marked curve section to the normal scaling 
of the x-axis.

By increasing the sampling rate with the "<Time>/Div" arrow keys, you can zoom in 
further into a curve section until the curve is completely expanded. 

With the "<Range>/Div" arrow keys, you can extend the curve in the vertical direction. 
This does not enhance the resolution, however. 

The settings group contains display ranges for the set values and two arrow keys which 
can be used to adjust the set values. 

0 Position: You can move the section along the x-axis if the recorded curve can no 
longer be completely displayed in the measurement value display. With the arrow keys, 
you can zoom in/out the section from 0 to 100% along the saved curve. The longer you 
hold the arrow key down, the faster the section moves. The percentage value indicates 
in which section of the saved area the section is located. 



As long as the reference and differential cursors are displayed (with channel CHI or CH2 
in the "Cursor" settings group selected), the section can only be displaced between the 
two cursors. To scroll through the entire memory, you have to deselect both channels in 
the "Cursor" settings group 


The visible section is displayed in the graph 
display by the size and position of the status 
bar at the top of the display. 

0 <Time>/Div: This is where you define the 
sampling rate, in other words, it determines 
the horizontal scale of the graph which 
appears on the oscilloscope screen. The 
associated unit, e.g. "ms/Div", is displayed 
via the left arrow key.

Select a sensor with the arrow keys. If the sensor is not yet connected, a corresponding 
message appears. 

0 Offset: The signal displayed on Channel 1 or 2 can be respectively overlaid with a 
constant component or a DC voltage (offset). The offset value is preset to 
0%; you can change the range ±100% of the y-axis. 

0 <Measurement range>/Div: This setting designates the group of measurement 

ranges and depends on the sensor selected. Set the 
range with the arrow keys; it will be displayed in the 
associated display range. The physical unit is above 
the left-hand arrow key. 

The set range is transferred to the y-axis. 

0 Coupling: Signal coupling for the corresponding channel. 

The following settings are possible: 

0 GND (Ground): The input is decoupled from the sensor and is grounded. 

0 AC (Alternating Current): Only alternating current components are represent 

in the curve. 

0 DC (Direct Current): Alternating and direct current components are represented 

in the curve. 

The buttons for the non-available coupling types are gray. 

Trigger 

In the "Trigger" area, you can set the source, the (trigger) position, the trigger value 
(level), the slope and the mode. The current trigger position and trigger value are 
indicated by an arrow, with the arrow direction indicating slope. 

0 Source: The group of sensors. A trigger signal is transmitted to the oscilloscope 

via a sensor. 

Select from the possible sensors: 

• Probe 1 and/or 2 

• kV clip/RVZ cable 

• 50 A or 1000 A clip-on ammeters

Select a sensor using the arrow keys. If the sensor is not yet connected, a corresponding 

message will appear. 

0 Position: With the arrow keys, you can displace the trigger time along the x-axis 

between 10% and 90% along the graph display. The default setting is 50%; 
the signal in this case is triggered in the middle of the graph display. 

0 Level: With the arrow keys, you set the amplitude at which triggering should occur 
as a percentage of the y-axis. 

0 Slope: Defines whether triggering should occur on the positive or negative slope, 

whereby only one switch ("pos" or "neg") can be activated at one time. If both 
buttons are inactive, the trigger is activated whenever the set trigger value is 
reached, regardless of whether this occurs on the rising or falling slope. 

0 Mode: Except in record mode, a trigger mode is always active. 

The default setting is "Auto". 

0 Auto: If no trigger is set, then an untriggered image will be shown. 

0 Norm: Prerequisite for a display is the availability of a trigger. 


0 Single: Stops the oscilloscope measurement after the first valid trigger signal. 

If you click the "Single" button again, the mode is reactivated and recording 
of another measuring signal can begin.

Record Mode 

In record mode, the measurements are recorded without being triggered continuously 
and temporarily stored. 

Recording begins when you click the "Record" button. During recording, the latest mea¬ 
surements are presented in the graph display. The remaining memory capacity is contin¬ 
uously displayed as a percentage in the measurement display. 

The trigger mode cannot be reactivated until the record mode has been stopped by 
clicking the "Record" button. 

Recording may be stopped by the following events: 

• Repeated clicking of the Record button 

• Reaching of the preset trigger level (depending on the trigger mode) 

• Memory full 

After completion (manual or automatic) of data recording, the "Compress" button is acti¬ 
vated and the entire curve along the x-axis is compressed to the width of the graph. 
Various tools are available for closer examination of the curve, using cursor settings and 
the adjustment of values under "Time".

Action Line 

The action line contains the following buttons: 

0 Save settings: You can save oscilloscope settings. Saved settings are stored on the 

ISIS workshop server and are thus available on every ISID that is 
linked to the respective ISIS in online mode. You start the operation 
by selecting the "Save settings" button in the action line. The "Save 
oscilloscope settings" mask appears. Enter a name in the "Save 
under" field under which the settings should be saved. The workshop 
system checks whether the name has already been assigned. 


"Save oscilloscope settings" mask 



"Save oscilloscope settings" mask (no current screenshot) 

0 Load/delete settings: The button is only active if oscilloscope settings have been 

saved. You can load or delete saved oscilloscope settings 
after you have clicked this button. The "Load oscilloscope 
settings" window opens with a list of saved oscilloscope 
settings. 

Select a line and click one of the following buttons: 

0 Load: The settings are loaded into the oscilloscope. The window closes. 

0 Delete: Deletes the selected settings. The window stays open. 

0 Cancel: Closes the window after opening.

0 Quit measuring device: The IMIB is reset, any activated signals are switched 

off, and the workshop system returns to the 
"Measuring devices" mask. 


Signals 

The signals feed defined direct currents as well as direct and alternating voltages to the 
sensors and leads or simulate resistances. You can observe the effects with measuring 
instruments. 

With the "Signals" tab, you parameterize the signal functions of the IMIB. 

“Signals” tab 



144 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 



































































The content range contains a settings group for each of the signal sources, i.e. direct 
voltage, generator, direct current and simulator. 

The settings for "Amplitude", "Frequency", "Sample ratio" and "Resistor" consist 
respectively of a display range for the set value and two arrow keys left and right, with 
which you can adjust the signal. The longer you hold the arrow key down, the faster the 
signal value changes. 

The setting "Signal" provides a separate button for the "Rectangular" and "Sinusoidal" 
signal types. 

Select a signal by clicking its heading. It is not possible to make multiple selections. 

If you switch to Multimeter or Oscilloscope and then return to Signals, then the most 
recent setting is retained. However, if you quit the Measuring instruments and then call 
up Signals again, then the settings will be reset to the default values. 

The buttons in the action line have the following functions: 

• Start/Stop: Transmits the set signals to the IMIB. In the message line, a message 

appears, indicating that the signals are active. When you click the button 
a second time, you switch the signals off again. 

• Exit measuring devices: Switches active signals off, sets the measuring instru¬ 

ments back to the IMIB, and returns to the "Measuring 
instruments" tab. 


145

• Click the name of the signal source: "Direct voltage" or "Direct current". 

• Select a value in the appropriate signal source with the arrow keys. 

• Click the "Start/Stop" button. 

• Click the "Start/Stop" again when you wish to terminate the signal feed. 

How to adjust the alternating current generator: 

• Click the name of the signal source: "Generator". 

• Select the signal form: "Rectangular" or "Sinusoidal". 

• Set the amplitude and frequency with the respective arrow keys. 

• If you have selected the "Rectangular" signal form: Set the sampling rate 
with the corresponding arrow keys. 

• Click the "Start/Stop" button. 

• Click the "Start/Stop" again when you wish to terminate the signal feed. 

How to simulate a resistance: 

• Click the name of the signal source: "Simulator". 

• Set the desired resistance with the corresponding arrow keys. 

The permissible resistance values are displayed in the window. 

• Click the "Start/Stop" button. 

• Click the "Start/Stop" again when you wish to terminate the signal feed.

Integrated Measurement Interface Box (IMIB) 


The workshop trolley used for Group Tester One, or GT1, can continue to be used for 
the new workshop system. It is simply a case of having to exchange the brackets for 
GT1 with the brackets for the Integrated Service Information Display. The brackets 
were delivered with the Integrated Service Information Display (ISID).

Intake or exhaust camshaft signal. Note that signal 
amplitude is approximately 5V, reinforcing that: 

1) The reference voltage is good, and; 

2) The signal is being grounded by the hall element 
to less that 100 mil This is indicating that the cir¬ 
cuit board has a credible ground at the DME.

Workshop Hint 

This is a compliant crankshaft signal @ the DME and is 
from a 3 wire hall sensor that receives 12 volts yet the 
digital signal has an amplitude of 5 volts. 

The large tooth that is captured at 7ms is the indicator of 
TDC. The frequency of the sensor indicates RPM (rate 
at which the trigger wheel accelerates or decelerates 
past the hall element.) and the duration of each cycle 
assists with engine misfire detection.

This is the EPDW ground signal provided by the DME. You'll note 
that the time for this signal is shown @ 0.52 ms and the voltage 
here is below 340 mV reinforcing a good ground under load. The 
percentage or duty cycle is shown to be 86.6%, remember that this 
value is the time that the EPDW coil is NOT being grounded. 

Pic 2 ™" 

The cursors are plotted on the EPDW signal when it is not being 
grounded by the DME. This would represent the 86.6% of duty cycle 
and the time that this signal remained high is shown as 4.20ms. 
Also, you can validate that the voltage to this device is sufficient 
@ 15.215 volts DC

Workshop Hint 

This primary ignition event is at an idle and shows multi¬ 
ple events. The system will switch to a single event if the 
idle is raised above 1,300 RPM. 

The key is analyzing the spark event for amplitude (coil 
inductance), burn time and coil oscillations to determine 
winding condition. 

Primary B+ voltage and ground credibility can be 
determined at the DME rather than accessing the 
coil connector.

Workshop Hint 

The ion current combustion monitoring is used for knock identification and 
misfiring identification on some Motorsport Engines (S65 and S85). 

The ionic current is measured after ignition occurs. A low voltage is 
applied between the electrodes of the spark plug immediately after the 
end of the ignition spark and the resulting current (ionic current) is mea¬ 
sured. 

For the purposes of smoothing the voltage and electromagnetic compati¬ 
bility, an "ignition suppression capacitor" is installed in the wiring harness 
of each cylinder bank (in the S85 this is in the ion current control device). 
This is electrically connected using terminal 87 and vehicle earth. 

The interface between DME and Coil is a bidirectional communication 
with different modes: 

• Weak 4V = idle, no communication. 

• Strong OV = digital Signal from DME to coil for primary coil drive and 

adjusting amplification of ion current measurement. 

• >5V = ion current signal from coil to DME. 

A typical sequence for one combustion is as follows 
(The numbers match those in the graphic): 

1. Setting ion current amplification and offset (DME => Coil) seen in the 
graph as a burst of low-pulses (100-200 ps, low voltage signal). 

2. Loading coil by a long low voltage signal (1-1,5 ms) (DME => Coil). 

At the end of this phase ignition is started, that is, the spark is 
released at the sparkplug (note how the Secondary Ignition Signal 
spikes). 

3. Setting line level to about 8V to set coil into ion current measurement 
mode (DME => Coil). 

4. Driving amplified ion current + offset on the line as a current signal 
(1-20mA, Coil => DME). 

5. DME release line to indicate idle line; coil sets line voltage to a 
Weak 4V level. 

6. DME calculates misfire, knock detection, diagnostic info and amplifi¬ 
cation for next combustion.

This scope pattern has the cursor on the supply to the 
injector informing the Tech that the feed and windings 
are capable of carrying the potential (voltage) to the 
DME and the winding resistance state of health (imped¬ 
ance) is acceptable since the inductive spike is around 
55 volts. 

It’s important to note that as resistance decreases, the 
amplitude of the inductive spike will decrease. Also, 
always remember to compare to the other cylinders.

Workshop Hint 

HDEV Injectors Basic Information 

The following electrical interface specification is valid for the HDEV 5.2 and for a system pressure of 
20 MPa. A 65V output stage is required for driving the HDEV 5.2. Driving with constant voltage is not 
allowed. 

The maximum permissible coil temperature of HDEV5.2 injectors is 140°C (284°F). 

Driving Phases 

HDEV5.2 driving occurs in 4 phases (see diagram on the right). 

1. Booster phase 

Opening of the HDEV5.2 is initiated in the booster phase (No. 1 in the diagram) by a high booster 
voltage U Boost from the DME, through commuting the booster capacitor on the HDEV5.2. The booster 

phase ends upon reaching the booster current I Boost (approx. 10A). The high current is achieved by 
a voltage of up to approx. 65 Volt. The maximum booster time t Boost max must not be exceeded. 

2. Energization phase (Pickup phase) 

In the energization phase (or pickup phase, No. 2 in the diagram), the HDEV5.2 is completely opened 
by controlling the current to approx. 6.2A, the so called pickup current l A . The effective pickup current 

I A e ff must be provided. Time t 1 comprehends the booster phase and the pickup phase, i.e. from the 

beginning of the booster phase till the commuting of pickup current unto holding current. 

At the end of this phase, the current is reduced from the energization to the holding current level 
of approx. 2.5A. Time t 2 must not be exceeded while switching over. 

3. Hold phase 

The energized HDEV5.2 is kept open by controlling the current at approx. 2.5A (holding current 
I hold eff) in th e hold phase (No. 3 in the diagram). The low current level yields a fast closing and 

low heat dissipation at the HDEV5.2 and the output stage. 

4. Switch off phase 

The current is switched off at the end of the injection time f # - in the switch off phase (No. 4 in the 
diagram). In this phase the voltage U discharge (or-U Boost ) must have at least the level of U Boost . 

At least 2 milliseconds elapse between two injection cycles. 

Current Profiles for HDEV5.2 driving 

A target current profile must be provided for opening and holding the HDEV5.2 open. Depending on 
the fuel system, the system pressure may vary. The current profiles are defined for several system 
pressures in order to keep the power dissipation low. 

General injector data 

• Ohmic resistance of HDEV 5.2 at 23°C (73°F): 1.50 ± 5%. 

• Inductance: L = 2.1 mH (typical value, not specified with tolerances) 
at 1 KHz measurement frequency.

Workshop Hint 

The shown scope image illustrates the voltage across an 
HPI injector. This is the main injection signal and you 
can see that it is activated by more than 100V. 

Measuring voltage across the injector is a good way to 
determine whether an injector is actually being activated.

Workshop Hint 

This pattern was captured at the DME utilizing a 200 
microseconds snapshot - 

Once again, the added value of scoping this signal is 
that we can look at the power supply to the control valve 
noted at 14.223 volts before the solenoid is activated. 

We can also confirm that the final stage and ground at 
the DME are working accordingly since the actuated 
value is around 100 mV. 



The actuation of this control valve is dependent on many parameters 
and we can't determine that the ON time meets the engines demands. 
We would need to compare that to another known good vehicle if that 
was needed.

Workshop Hint 

This is a sample of PT-CAN Low. 

Base voltage starting @ 2.559V (binary 0) and pulling down to 1.571V (binary 1). 

The amplitude of this bus, as far as the IMIB, is dependent on the time base you use. 
Anything greater than 50 microseconds, as seen here, may display a voltage value 
that would be inaccurate. Utilizing smaller values, i.e. 100 or 200 microseconds, would 
allow you to look at more details and less bits. That is acceptable and sometimes rec¬ 
ommended. You'll note the anomaly in the center and end of the screen. This is quite 
normal and doesn't always represent a problem. 

Also note that images are mirrors of each other. Differences in voltage and bits of data 
as compared to each other are considered to be a problem. Always use the basic bus 
diagnosis troubleshooting techniques for any CAN or single wire bus faults or errors.

PT-CAN lines shorted together. 

Note that the voltage is around 2 volts and the attempt to 
communicate is repetitive. Also important is the fact that 
the binary voltage thresholds are not being met.

Workshop Hint 

Here is an example of an analog input from the PWG 
(Pedalwertgeber or Pedal Position Sensor) to the DME. 

The advantage of scoping this signal (Hall elements in 
this case) is that you can check it for irregularities. The 
scope pattern should mirror each other (although one of 
the signals is Vi the voltage) and any glitches from 
unsteady actuation would be present on the other sen¬ 
sor. Otherwise these momentary faults would be over¬ 
looked unless you scope them. 

The time base should be slow so the recorded signal 
can be analyzed.

Workshop Hint 

Here is an example of a VANOS solenoid that is fed 
12 volts and is awaiting a ground from the DME’s tran¬ 
sistor in order to actuate the valve to open. The pattern 
shows a credible voltage awaiting @ the DME and a 
circuit to ground assuring the solenoid windings are 
good and the circuit is complete. 

The ground is acceptable since the voltage when 
actuated is @ 167 mV.

Workshop Hint 

This screen shot is from one phase (BLDC_V) of the VVT motor 
with reference to ground at KL_31 @ the DME. Each of the 3 field 
windings in the VVT motor (U, V and W) have a current applied to 
them in a synchronous fashion. This will create a magnetic field at 
that winding and the VVT motor armature which has permanent 
magnets in it and in turn repel or attract the magnets in order to 
rotate. 

If one phase were to have an open wire, winding or lack of voltage, 
the magnetic field in that phase (120 degrees) would not be created 
and the motor, in theory, would only be able to cover the other 240 
degrees. The reality is it would be faulted and cease to move. 

The voltage amplitude created at these windings is approximately 
between 7 and 14 volts as displayed in the example.

Workshop Hint 

This oscilloscope pattern is showing a Window Motor Hall 
Element, used to monitor speed and uniformity. This particular 
graphic describes a good motor as it shows a synchronous pattern. 
If you were to scope one that showed changes that are NOT syn¬ 
chronous, it would indicate a change of speed due to a mechanical 
issue e.g. something trapped between the glass etc. 

Binary values for this signal are reported to the Master Controller, in 
this case the FRM. Binary 1 and 0 are ~11007 mV and ~9381 mV. 

Remember, when in doubt always compare the value to another 
"good" window motor so you have a reference! 



The measurement was done @ BFJNK1 or BFJNK2 to KL_31, 
SSP-SP0000053371 - Power Window (F25). See the SSP 
with some notes on the next page.

The switch contains all the coded grounds 
through resistors. Each one is unique to 
the voltage that will be biased when 
switched through that resistive element. 
This in turn will be identified as a specific

an analog input.

FRM input signal 
FH_BF@Pin28/A 34 *2B: 


Momentary up = ~4100 mV 

This analog value on the DVOM is a request 
for momentary up or movement of the glass 
window as long as the switch is held to the 
first detent position. Once released, the glass 
will stop moving. Here the bias voltage is 
skewed by the switch through a resistor 
network to 4100 mV. 


Momentary down = ~2092 mV 

This coded value is an analog signal request¬ 
ing the control module to actuate the window 
to move as long as the switch is held. It's a 
request for momentary down. 

Toll down = ~927 mV 

This analog value created by the coded 
ground (resistive device in the switch) biases 
the reference voltage to a specific value, is a 
request for toll down to the control module. 


The DVOM is a perfect tool for this analog 
data! 

Toll up = ~3256 mV 

This analog value created by the coded 
ground (resistive device in the switch) biases 
the reference voltage to a specific value, is a 
request for toll up to the control module. 


Static “N” = -4969 mV 

Static Neutral position. Here is the bias volt¬ 
age coming from the FRM and not influenced 
by the switch. This is verification that the FRM 
is providing the reference voltage to the coded 
ground/switch. If we had no voltage or too 
much potential at this pin, we would never be 
able to create the analog signal to request the 
commands required.

Workshop Hint 

This oscilloscope pattern shows the “erratic” signal voltage applied 
to the window motor near its end travei. The Control Unit does 
this to “soft stop” the motor and prevents it from “banging”. If you 
take a closer look at the scope pattern you can see that it is show¬ 
ing battery voltage and credible ground applied from the master 
controller. The cursors could be moved to these points to establish 
that there are no voltage drops (Vd) under operation conditions on 
both B+ and B- coming from the control unit. This avoids unneces¬ 
sary Vd tests. A picture speaks a million words! 

Please note that the peak voltage denoted on the reference cursor 
(left) is a spike due to the internal driver shutting ON and OFF. 



The measurement was done @ MFBA or MFBZ to KL_31, 
SSP-SP0000053371 - Power Window (F25).

Workshop Hint 

(1) The hall element digital signal low for this application is 

~1171 mV. The consistency of this signal can be compared to 
the other signals on this screen (all of them go to -1171 mV). 
You can also view more cycles by changing the time base 
to 5 or 10 ms. 

Remember, the digital “handshake” requires a voltage level to 
be established, not just a signal that"looks good". 

(2) The hall element digital signal high is ~6600 mV. 

See (1) for hints.

Workshop Hint 

(1) This pattern shows the positive voltage applied to the DC motor. 
The Reference Cursor shows 14.33 V which would conform that 
the B+ side of the circuit has no concerns. A voltage drop test at 
that wire or the driver itself (M88) would not be required. 

(2) The Difference Cursor shows the “B- driven value” which is 
100 mV. This would validate that the ground credibility is within 
specs and no voltage drop on the module or wire is needed. 
Remember, the HKL module is capable of driving both B+ and 
B-. When this motor voltage is looked at with a DVOM, the 
value is a calculated average of approximately 14.3 V at 50% 
duty cycle or 7 V. Also, we vary the speed of the lid so the 
DVOM is a bad choice of tool!

Workshop Hint 

The line we're looking at is one of the shielded lines coming from the HKL 
module to the HKL motor (M88 or M43). This line is shielded to prevent 
any Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) created by the drives to be 
induced into delicate circuits i.e hall or audio antennas. 

The fault caused by an open shield line may not always be evident or 
cause a fault code. We could check continuity to ground, but by monitor¬ 
ing this line while using the HKL motor, we can watch for induced noise 
such as voltage spikes. The scope is hooked to the shielded terminal on 
HKL@Pin 7/A218*2B and KL_31. This voltage drop (Vd) test with the 
scope is the most precise way to eliminate any concerns with a credible 
shield wire to KL_31. 

(1) & (2) show the Reference and Difference Cursors at 0 V, with no noise 
at all during operation. Hence we can conclude it is a “good shielded line”!

be transmitted. The Reference Cursor shows binary 1 voltage at around 1 V 
(1030 mV to be exact). Once the voltage fails to pull down to approximately 

~ 1200-1300 mV, we start to see communication faults. In other words, if the 
voltage were to fail to pull below that threshold, we would need to diagnose 
accordingly, find the culprit and fix the bus communication fault. 

(2) The Difference Cursor shows the value for binary 0. The threshold for 
this voltage is generally greater than 9 V and is usually around 12 V on all 
single wire bus systems. The Footwell Module (FRM) is the Master of the bus 
and is also responsible for the voltage to establish communication. The switch 
participates as a "secondary control unit" and cannot work without the FRM. 



The measurement was done @ K_LIN_8 to KL_31, 
SSP-SP0000053261 - Front fog lights and rear fog lights.

(1) Channel 1 (green line) 

is the KL_30F OFF signal 

(Pin 3 @ Z2*12B). 



(2) Channel 2 (red line) is 

the KL_30F ON signal, first red “blip” starting 

from left side (Pin 5 @ 

Z2*12B). 


(3) Channel 2 (red line), the second red blip 

is KL_15N and KL_30B 

being powered back up 

(Pin 10 @ Z2*12B). 



These measurements were done on: 

“KL_30F_AUS” Pin 3 @ connector Z2*12B to Pin 10 @ Z2*12B. 
“KL_30F_EIN” Pin 5 @ connector Z2*12B to Pin 10 @ Z2*12B.

The leads should be connected to:

KL 30F EIN Pin 5 (5) connector Z2*12B to Pin 10 (a). Z2*12B.. 


Workshop Hint 

After verifying that the signal is OK, you can check the resistance of the 
bi-stable relay to confirm it is also OK. Both ends should be roughly the same. 
As an example see the following: 

A known “Good Relay”: 

Pin 3 to Pin 2 @ Z2*12B = 8.7Q 

Pin 5 to Pin 2 @ Z2*12B = 7.2 f) 

A known “Bad Relay”: 

Pin 3 to Pin 2 @ Z2*12B = 75.4 0 

Pin 5 to Pin 2 @ Z2*12B = 75.3 O 



SSP-SP0000053963 - Terminal Control (F25), pins 35 & 40 on 
A34*1B on component A43 should list KL_30 instead of KL_31.

*** ISTA/P will give COAPI fault codes on the final report whenever there was a problem with programming/coding. The COAPI 1000 
code, where all modules in the vehicle fail to code, is typically a conflict code within the VO. For example: “a vehicle” will come 
with pre-wire code 0694 in the VO. When the vehicle gets retrofitted with a CD changer, the VO is modified by adding code 
0672 and removing code 0694. If this procedure is not done, ISTA/P will issue the COAPI 1000 message.

Current Draw Diagnosis 

Why do we use a voltage drop measurement across a fuse to 
determine the current draw on the circuit that the fuse feeds? 



Who figured this out? 

By looking at the picture above you already recognize that a voltage drop (Vd) measure¬ 
ment is being performed across a working fuse. But how is this going to help us deter¬ 
mine the current draw of the circuit? Let’s find out! 

We can thank George Simon Ohm for his theory. He proved that voltage (V), current (A) 
and resistance (Q), all have effects on one another - remember “Ohm’s Law”? 

Well, Engineers use this Law when designing the fuses so they “blow” when current 
exceeds its rated value. The data that the Current Data Matrix provides utilizes the fuse’s 
material cross sectional diameter (0), facilitating the true resistance of the fuse, which 
together with the voltage drop measurement, allows them to calculate the current draw 
of the circuit. This is the reason why the chart found in the next couple of pages is so 
accurate. This chart MUST BE USED as indicated since each fuse size has a different 
cross sectional diameter! 

What advantage does it have? 

The key advantage of using this chart is that there are no math calculations needed 
as they have already been done for you. It is that easy! All you need to do is measure the 
voltage drop (Vd) across each exposed pin of the fuse and the millivolt [mV] reading will 
tell you the current consumption in the circuit that the fuse feeds. 



It is accurate to 5% on an OEM quality fuse. 


216 

Advanced Vehicle Diagnosis 



















How to use the chart to diagnose a Parasitic Current Draw? 

In order to describe how to use the chart, let us start out with the scenario of a car that 
exhibits a parasitic current draw, which has already been confirmed via an “Energy 
Management test” using BMW Diagnostic Equipment. The task that we are now facing 
is finding out where that current draw is located. 

1. Before you begin the “Divide and Conquer” process to find the parasitic current, 
the car must be parked and “sleeping”. We can generically estimate 30 minutes 
to full sleep in BN2020 vehicles and up to 60 minutes on BN2000 and previous 
models. This can still vary, so please research the sleep protocol for your model 
on ISTA. It is also important to remember certain key points such as a “CAS push 
button that remains lit”. This would indicate bus activity and high current draws. 

A scenario such as this one would require you to wait or diagnose a more 
serious issue of a bus that will not go to sleep. 

Another good source of information is SI B61 08 00 Closed-circuit Current 
Measurement. Process is everything; you may only get one chance to 
replicate the draw! 

2. Now, take the 100 amp clamp from the IMIB toolbox and place it over the 
body “B-” cable at the battery. Typically, draws that exceed 80 mA will set faults 
and if they are present, you are half way there! 

3. Next, isolate the path of current on the voltage distributor on the battery. There 
are multiple paths for “B+” voltage to travel depending on the model. Everything 
leaving the voltage distributor is fused and the other cable goes to the front of 
the car (engine bay). Clamp each one individually until you locate the path of the 
excess current. Two scenarios are possible: 

a) If the current that is above specs is found on the cable to the front of the car 
(BST protected), follow the appropriate SSP to reveal if that’s the alternator, 
starter, etc., and isolate the cause. 

b) If the current that is above specs is on one of the feeds for the fuse panel(s), 
then we will be using the Current Data Matrix and measure the voltage drop 
across the fuse to isolate the circuit. 

In the past, you may have pulled fuses individually until the current 
consumption dropped. Please avoid this procedure if possible! 

Why? Because each fuse you pull may reset a control module and 
temporarily eliminate the concern. Now the diagnosis will not be 
possible and the car will most likely come back. So, we are going 
to “sneak up” on the draw.

4. The Current Draw Matrix: 


a) After you determined which fuse panel contains the draw, access that panel. 
Sometimes they are difficult to access since you have to get the meter 
leads at each fuse contact with the fuse in the panel. Remember to leave 
the fuse in the panel! If the fuse has a small plastic clear cover over the ter¬ 
minals, take a dental pick and remove the cover for diagnosis. Do not forget 
to reinstall it after you are done! 


b) Move the rotary switch on your DVOM to the millivolts [mV] setting. 

Using the Volts [V] setting will not render the needed accuracy for 
this measurement! 



c) Put one lead on one end of the fuse and the other lead on the opposite end 
(see graphic on next page). 

d) Keep measuring all the fuses in the panel until you get an “elevated” 
millivolt [mV] reading for that fuse rating (see the chart). This will indicate 
the parasitic draw you isolated with the amp clamp test. 

e) Now, isolate what is on that circuit to finalize the diagnosis. 


Workshop Hint 

Some draws only show their “ugly face” in certain situ¬ 
ations: when cold; some when hot; some after driving; 

some after sitting; some after accessory use; etc. 
This is why it is advisable to gather as much informa¬ 
tion from the customer as possible , which combined 
with your skill and tenacity, will make for a successful 

diagnosis!

Vd Measurement @ Fuse for 
Current Draw Matrix calculation. 



Using the Volts [V] 
setting will not render the 
needed accuracy for this 
measurement! Instead, use 
the millivolt [mV] setting.

Current Draw Matrix 

The following chart is used to determine the amperage across a circuit by measuring 
the voltage drop across the fuse and comparing it against the fuse rating. 

The Current Draw Matrix shows the measured voltage drop (Vd) across the fuse in the 
left hand column. It also shows the different fuses (Mini or Standard) with the amperage 
rating (up to 30 amps). 

Lastly, it provides the current draw based on the Vd measurement you just performed. 
Below is an example of how to use this Matrix:

As the example shows, there is a voltage drop of 0.2mV (1) across a 

m3 Standard 5 Amp fuse (2). 


By performing this voltage drop it tells us that the current consumption 
through this circuit is 13mA (3). 



This Matrix applies to OEM fuses only!
