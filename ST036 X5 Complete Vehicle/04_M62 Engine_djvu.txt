M62 TU VANOS 


OVERVIEW 


The variable intake valve timing system on the M62 TU continues to be identified as 
VANOS. This acronym comes from the German words; VAriable NOckenwellen Steuerung, 
which means Variable Camshaft Control. 


The M62 TU VANOS system is a new variant providing stepless VANOS functionality on 
each intake camshaft. The system is continuously variable within its range of adjustment 
providing optimized camshaft positioning for all engine operating conditions. 


While the engine is running, both 
intake camshafts are continuously 
adjusted to their optimum posi¬ 
tions. This enhances engine per¬ 
formance and reduces tailpipe 
emissions. 

Both camshafts are adjusted 
simultaneously within 20° (maxi¬ 
mum) of the camshafts rotational 
axis. 

This equates to a maximum span 
of 40° crankshaft rotation. The 
camshaft spread angles for both 
banks are as follows.

VANOS BENEFITS 

The design of a camshaft for a non adjustable valve timing system is limited to the required 

overall performance of the engine. 

• An intake camshaft with an advanced (early) profile will provide a higher performing 
power curve at a lower engine speed. But at idle speed the the advanced position will 
create a large area of intake/exhaust overlap that causes a rough, unstable idle. 

• On the other hand, an intake camshaft with a retarded (late) profile will provide a very 
smooth, stable idle but will lack the cylinder filling dynamics needed for performance 
characteristics at mid range engine speeds. 

The ability to adjust the valve timing improves the engines power dynamics and reduces 

tailpipe emissions by optimizing the camshaft angle for all ranges of engine operation. 

VANOS provides the following benefits: 

• Increased torque at lower to mid range engine speeds without a loss of power in the 
upper range engine speeds. 

• Increased fuel economy due to optimized valve timing angles. 

• Reduction of exhaust emissions due to optimized valve overlap. 

• Smoother idle quality due to optimized valve overlap.

VANOS CONTROL SOLENOID & CHECK VALVE: The VANOS solenoid is a two wire, 
pulse width modulated, oil pressure control valve. The valve has four ports; 


1. Input Supply Port - Engine Oil Pressure 

2. Output Retard Port - To rear of piston/helical gear (retarded camshaft position) 

3. Output Advance Port - To front of piston/helical gear (advanced camshaft position) 

4. Vent - Released oil pressure 

A check valve is positioned forward of the solenoid in the cylinder head oil gallery. The 
check valve maintains an oil supply in the VANOS transmission and oil circuits after the 
engine is turned off. This prevents the possibility of piston movement (noise) within the 
VANOS transmission system on the next engine start. 


7 







VANOS TRANSMISSION: The primary and secondary timing chain sprockets are inte 
grated with the VANOS transmission. The transmission is a self contained unit. 


The controlled adjustment of the 
camshaft occurs inside the “transmis¬ 
sion”. Similar in principle to the six 
cylinder engine VANOS systems, con¬ 
trolled oil pressure moves the piston 
axially. 

The helical gear cut of the piston acts 
on the helical gears on the inside sur¬ 
face of the transmission and rotates 
the camshaft to the specific advanced 
or retarded angle position. 

Three electrical pin contacts are locat¬ 
ed on the front surface to verify the 
default maximum retard position using 
an ohmmeter. This is required during 
assembly and adjustment, (see service 
notes further on).

OIL DISTRIBUTION FLANGES: The oil distribution flanges are bolted to the front surface 
of each cylinder head. They provide a mounting location for the VANOS solenoids as well 
as the advance-retard oil ports from the solenoids to the intake camshafts. 


CAMSHAFTS: Each intake camshaft has 
two oil ports separated by three sealing rings 
on their forward ends. 

The ports direct pressurized oil from the oil 
distribution flange to the inner workings of 
the VANOS transmission. 

Each camshaft has REVERSE threaded 
bores in their centers for the attachment of 
the timing chain sprockets on the exhaust 
cams and the VANOS transmissions for 
each intake camshaft as shown.

M62 TU VANOS CONTROL 


As the engine camshafts are rotated by the primary and secondary timing chains, the 
ME7.2 control module activates the VANOS solenoids via a PWM (pulse width modulated) 
ground signal based on a program map. The program is influenced by engine speed, load, 
and engine temperature. 


• Shown below: In its inactive or default position, the valves direct 100% engine oil pres¬ 
sure flow to achieve max “retard” VANOS positioning 







POSITION 




• Top of next page: As the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) increases on the control sig¬ 
nal, the valve progressively opens the advance oil port and proportionately closes the 
retarded oil port. 


Oil pressure pushes the piston toward the advance position. Simultaneously the oil 
pressure on the retarded side (rear) of the piston is decreased and directed to the vent 
port in the solenoid valve and drains into the cylinder head. 


• Bottom of next page: At maximum PWM control, 100% oil flow is directed to the front 
surface of the piston pushing it rearward to maximum advance. 


Varying the pulse width (on time) of the solenoids control signals proportionately regulates 
the oil pressures on each side of the pistons to achieve the desired VANOS advance angle.

VANOS SERVICE NOTES 


VALVE TIMING PROCEDURES 

Refer to TI5 for complete Valve Timing Procedures. M62 TU valve tinning adjustment is sim¬ 
ilar to the previous non VANOS M62 engine with the exception of setting the VANOS 
transmissions to their max retard positions with an ohmmeter and attaching the camshaft 
gears to each camshaft with single reverse threaded bolts. 

• After locking the crankshaft at TDC, the camshaft alignment tools (P/N 90 88 6 112 440) 
are placed on the square blocks on the rear of the camshafts locking them in place. 

• The exhaust camshaft sprockets and VANOS transmission units with timing chains are 
placed onto their respective camshafts. 

• The exhaust camshaft sprockets and VANOS transmissions are secured to the 
camshafts with their respective single, reverse threaded bolt. Finger tighten only at this 
point. Install the chain tensioner into the timing chain case and tension the chain. 

• Connect an ohmmeter across two of the three pin contacts on the front edge of one of 
the VANOS transmissions. Twist the inner hub of transmission to the left (counter clock¬ 
wise). Make sure the ohmmeter indicates closed circuit. This verifies that the trans¬ 
mission in the default max retard position. 

• Using an open end wrench on the camshaft to hold it in place, torque the VANOS trans¬ 
mission center bolt to specification. 

CAMSHAFT IMPULSE WHEEL POSITION TOOLS 

The camshaft impulse wheels require a special tool set 
to position them correctly prior to torquing the retaining 
nuts. 

The impulse wheels are identical for each cylinder 
bank. The alignment hole in each wheel must align 
with the tool’s alignment pin. Therefore the tools are 
different and must be used specifically for their bank. 

The tool rests on the upper edge of the cylinder head 
and is held in place by the timing case bolts. 

Refer to the TIS repair manual section for complete 
information. 







VANOS SOLENOID REPLACEMENT 


Refer to TIS repair manual section for com¬ 
plete solenoid replacement procedures. 

The solenoids are threaded into the oil distri¬ 
bution flanges through a small opening in the 
upper timing case covers. 

Special Tool 11 6 420 is required. 



VANOS TRANSMISSION RETARD POSI¬ 
TION SET UP TOOLS 

Special Tool 11 6 440 is used to rotate the 
transmission to the full retard position when 
checking the piston position with an ohmme- 
ter. 

This tool engages the inner hub of the trans¬ 
mission provides an easy method of twisting 
it to the left for the ohmmeter test. 



Refer to SI Bulletin 04 12 98 for additional 
special tool information. 


DIAGNOSIS 



The VANOS is fully compatible with the diagnostic software providing specific fault codes 
and test modules. Additionally, diagnostic requests section provides status of the PWM of 
the VANOS solenoids and camshaft position feedback via the camshaft position sensors. 
The Service Functions section of the DIS/MoDiC also provides a VANOS system test.

ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM 


The cooling system concepts introduced in 
the 1999 Model year including the automatic 
transmission heat exchanger and the the 
water cooled alternator have been retained 
for the X5. 

The component locations have however 
been changed: 

• Thermostat for heat exchanger mounted 
directly on radiator 

• Transmission heat exchanger - right side 
of radiator.

INTEGRAL ELECTRIC THROTTLE SYSTEM (EML) 


FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION 


When the accelerator pedal 
is moved, the PWG pro¬ 
vides a change in the mon¬ 
itored signals. The ME 7.2 
compares the input signal 
to a programmed map and 
appropriately activates the 
EDK motor via proportional¬ 
ly high/low switching cir¬ 
cuits. The control module 
self-checks it’s activation of 
the EDK motor via the EDK 
feedback potentiometers. 



Requirements placed on the Electric Throttle System: 

• Regulate the calculated intake air load based on PWG input signals and programmed 
mapping. 

• Control idle air when LL detected with regard to road speed as per previous systems. 

• Monitor the driver’s input request for cruise control operation. 

• Automatically position the EDK for accurate cruise control (FGR) operation. 

• Perform all DSC III throttle control interventions. 

• Monitor and carryout max engine and road speed cutout. 


17 


























































































PWG SIGNAL MONITORING & PWG FAILSAFE OPERATION: 


• As a redundant safety feature the PWG provides two separate signals from two integral 
potentiometers (Pot 1 and Pot 2) representing the driver’s request for throttle activation. 

• If the monitored PWG potentiometer signals are not plausible, ME 7.2 will only use the 
lower of the two signals as the driver’s pedal request input providing failsafe operation. 
Throttle response will be slower and maximum throttle position will be reduced. 

• When in PWG failsafe operation, ME 7.2 sets the EDK throttle plate and injection time 
to idle (LL) whenever the brake pedal is depressed. 

• When the system is in PWG failsafe operation, the instrument cluster matrix display will 
post “Engine Emergency Program” and PWG specific fault(s) will be stored in memory. 


EDK FEEDBACK SIGNAL MONITORING & EDK FAILSAFE OPERATION: 

• The EDK provides two separate signals from two integral potentiometers (Pot 1 and Pot 
2) representing the exact position of the throttle plate. 

• EDK Pot 1 provides the primary throttle plate position feedback. As a redundant safe¬ 
ty feature, Pot 2 is continuously cross checked with Pot 1 for signal plausibility. 

• If plausibility errors are detected between Pot 1 and Pot 2, ME 7.2 will calculate the 
inducted engine air mass (from HFM signal) and only utilize the potentiometer signal that 
closely matches the detected intake air mass. 

- The ME 7.2 uses the air mass signalling as a “virtual potentiometer” (pot 3) for a 
comparative source to provide failsafe operation. 

- If ME 7.2 cannot calculate a plausible conclusion from the monitored pots (1 or 2 
and virtual 3) the EDK motor is switched off and fuel injection cut out is activated 
(no failsafe operation possible). 

• The EDK is continuously monitored during all phases of engine operation. It is also 
briefly activated when KL 15 is initially switched on as a “pre-flight check” to verify it’s 
mechanical integrity (no binding, appropriate return spring tension, etc). This is accom¬ 
plished by monitoring both the motor control amperage and the reaction speed of the 
EDK feedback potentiometers. If faults are detected the EDK motor is switched off and 
fuel injection cut off is activated (no failsafe operation possible). The engine does how¬ 
ever continue to run extremely rough at idle speed. 

• When a replacement EDK is installed, the ME 7.2 adapts to the new component 
(required amperage draw for motor control, feedback pot tolerance differences, etc). 
This occurs immediately after the next cycle of KL 15 for approximately 30 seconds. 
During this period of adaptation, the maximum opening of the throttle plate is 25%. 


18 



INPUT SIGNALS/COMPONENTS 

CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSORS 

Located on the upper tinning case covers, the camshaft position sensors monitor the posi¬ 
tion of the camshafts to establish start of ignition firing order, set up sequential fuel injection 
triggering and for accurate camshaft advance-retard (VANOS) timing feedback. 

Each intake camshaft’s advance-retard angles are adjusted simultaneously yet indepen¬ 
dently. For this reason ME 7.2 requires a camshaft position sensor on each cylinder bank 
for accurate feedback to monitor the VANOS controlled camshaft positioning. 

The sensors are provided with operating power from the ECM main relay. The sensors pro¬ 
duce a unique asymmetrical square-wave signal representative of the impulse wheel shape. 
The sensors are new in the fact that they are “active” hall effect sensors. Active hall sen¬ 
sors provide: 

• low signal when a tooth of the camshaft impulse wheel is located in front of the sensor 

• high signal when an air gap is present. 


The active hall sensors supply a signal representative of camshaft position even before the 
engine is running. The ME 7.2 determines an approximate location of the camshafts posi¬ 
tions prior to engine start up optimizing cold start injection (reduced emissions.) 



19 
























HOT FILM AIR MASS SENSOR (HFM 5) 

The M62 TU is equipped with a new Hot Film 
Air Mass Sensor identified as HFM 5. It is a 
combined air mass/intake air temperature 
sensor. The separate intake air temperature 
sensor is no longer used on the M62 TU. 

The HFM 5 is provided with operating power 
from the ECM main relay. Based on calcu¬ 
lated intake air mass, the HFM 5 generates 
a varying voltage between 0.5 and 4.5 volts 
as an input signal to the ME 7.2 





An additional improvement of the HFM 5 is that the hot 
film element is not openly suspended in the center bore 
of the sensor as with previous HFMs. It is shrouded by 
a round fronted plastic labyrinth which isolates it from 
intake air charge pulsations. 

This feature allows the HFM to monitor and calculate the 
intake air volume with more accuracy. This feature adds 
further correction for calculating fuel injection “on” time 
(ti) which reduces emissions further. 


20 






































































INTEGRATED AMBIENT BAROMETRIC PRESSURE SENSOR 


The ME 7.2 Control Module contains an integral ambient barometric pressure sensor. The 
sensor is part of the SKE and is not serviceable. The internal sensor is supplied with 5 volts. 
In return it provides a linear voltage of approx. 2.4 to 4.5 volts representative of barometric 
pressure (altitude). 

The ME 7.2 monitors barometric pressure for the following reasons: 

• The barometric pressure signal along with calculated air mass provides an additional 
correction factor to further refine injection “on” time. 


• Provides a base value to calculate the air mass being injected into the exhaust system 
by the secondary air injection system. This correction factor alters the secondary air 
injection “on” time, optimizing the necessary air flow into the exhaust system. 


• Recognition of altitude 
above the accepted cri¬ 
teria postponing DM-TL 
activation for evapora¬ 
tive emission leak diag¬ 
nosis.

RADIATOR OUTLET TEMP SENSOR 


First seen on the MS 42.0 control system, the ME 
7.2 uses an additional water temperature sensor 
located on the radiator outlet. 

ME 7.2 requires this signal to monitor the water 
temperature leaving the radiator for precise acti¬ 
vation of the IHKA auxiliary fan. 



DSC III - ROAD SPEED SIGNAL 

ME 7.2 receives the road speed signal directly 
from the DSC III control module for maximum 
vehicle speed management. The DSC control 
module provides a processed output of the right 
rear wheel speed sensor as a digital square wave 
signal. The frequency of the signal is proportion¬ 
al to the speed of the vehicle (48 pulses per one 
revolution of the wheel). 


RADIATOR 

OUTLET 

TEMPERATURE 

SENSOR 



The cruise control function (FGR) of the ME 7.2 also monitors vehicle speed from the redun¬ 
dant vehicle speed CAN bus signal. The CAN bus speed signal is provided by the DSC III 
control module and based on the combined average of both front wheel speed signals. 


Additionally, ME 7.2 monitors all four wheel speed signals via CAN bus signalling to detect 
abrupt fluctuations in vehicle speed signals for the purpose of detecting rough road sur¬ 
faces. This is continuously monitored as part of the OBD II emission requirements provid¬ 
ing a correction factor for misfire detection plausibility. Earlier systems only monitored the 
right rear speed signal input from DSC.

ACCELERATOR PEDAL SENSOR (PWG) 


The driver's application of the accelerator pedal is monitored by a PWG sensor in the dri¬ 
ver's footwell as with previous non-bowden cable EML systems. 

The PWG provides two separate variable voltage signals to the ME 7.2 control module for 
determining the request for operating the Electric Throttle Valve (EDK) as well as providing 
a kickdown request with automatic transmission vehicles.

• In vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission (A5S 440Z), the ME 7.2 recognizes 
the max pedal value (4.5V) as a kickdown request and signals the AGS via CAN bus. 

PWG SIGNAL MONITORING & PWG FAILSAFE OPERATION: 

• If the monitored PWG potentiometer signals are not plausible, ME 7.2 will only use the 
lower of the two signals as the driver’s pedal request input providing failsafe operation. 
Throttle response will be slower and maximum throttle position will be reduced. 

• When in PWG failsafe operation, ME 7.2 sets the EDK throttle plate and injection time 
to idle (LL) whenever the brake pedal is depressed. 

• When the system is in PWG failsafe operation, the instrument cluster matrix display will 
post “Engine Emergency Program” and PWG specific fault(s) will be stored in memory.

EDK THROTTLE POSITION FEEDBACK SIGNALS 


The EDK throttle plate position is monitored by two integrated potentiometers. The poten¬ 
tiometers provide DC voltage feedback signals as input to the ME 7.2 for throttle and idle 





control functions 


Potentiometer signal 1 is the primary signal, Potentiometer sig¬ 
nal 2 is used as a plausibility cross-check through the total 
range of throttle plate movement.

- The ME 7.2 uses the air mass signalling as a “virtual potentiometer” (pot 3) for a

• The EDK is continuously monitored during all phases of engine operation. It is also 
briefly activated when KL 15 is initially switched on as a “pre-flight check” to verify it’s 
mechanical integrity (no binding, appropriate return spring tension) by monitoring the 
motor control amperage and the reaction speed of the EDK feedback potentiometers. 


24 


If faults are detected the EDK motor is switched off and fuel injection cut off is activat¬ 
ed (no failsafe operation possible). The engine does however continue to run extreme¬ 
ly rough at idle speed. 























MFL CRUISE CONTROL DATA SIGNAL 


The ME 7.2 control module provides the FGR cruise control function. Throttle activation is 
provided by ME 7.2 automatic control of the EDK and monitoring of the throttle plate posi¬ 
tion feedback potentiometer signals. 


All of the familiar driver requested cruise control function requests are provided to the ME 
7.2 control module via the MFL control module on a single FGR data signal wire. 





BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH 


The Electronic Brake Switch (Hall effect) provides brake pedal position status to the ME 7.2. 
The control module monitors both the brake light and a separate brake light test switch cir¬ 
cuits for plausibility. 

When the brake pedal is pressed the brake light segment of the switch provides a ground 
signal. Simultaneously, the brake light test switch (located in the same housing) provides a 
high signal. 


25 







































































CAN BUS 


• The CAN bus consists entirely of a twisted pair wire set. This configuration eliminates 
the need for a ground shield. 

• The Engine Control Module has two CAN bus communication ports, one dedicated to 
AGS and the other for the balance of the vehicle’s CAN bus control modules. 

• This configuration improves the reliability of CAN bus signalling. If an open occurs in one 
area, the other control systems can still communicate on either side of the open. 

• However, signals not reaching their intended recipients will cause CAN bus faults to be 
stored in the affected systems.

OUTPUT CONTROL FUNCTIONS 


FUEL PUMP RELAY CONTROL 


ME 7.2 controls the fuel pump relay as with previous systems with regard to engine speed 
input for continual activation of the relay. 


The ME 7.2 will switch off the fuel pump relay when an airbag is activated as an addition¬ 


al safety function. The signal is passed from the MRS III control module to the ME 7.2 over 
the CAN line

E BOX FAN CONTROL 

The E Box fan is controlled by ME 7.2. The control module 
contains an integral NTC temperature sensor for the pur¬ 
pose of monitoring the E box temperature and activating the 
fan. 

When the temperature in the E-Box exceeds predetermined 
values, ME 7.2 provides a switched ground for the E Box fan 
to cool the E box located control modules. 

With every engine start-up, ME 7.2 briefly activates the fan 
ensuring continued fan motor operation for the service life of 
the vehicle. This feature is intended to prevent fan motor 
“lock up” from lack of use due to pitting or corrosion over 
time.

The DME ME7.2 control unit controls the vacuum vent valve and the secondary air injec¬ 
tion pump relay separately but simultaneously. 

The secondary air pump operates at a start temperature of between 10°C and 40°C. It con¬ 
tinues to operate for a max. of 2 minutes at idle speed. 


ME 7.2 contributes an additional correction factor for secondary air “on” time with the addi¬ 
tional input from the integral ambient barometric pressure sensor. 


ME 7.2 



This sensor provides a base value to calculate the air mass being 
injected into the exhaust system. This helps to “fine tune” the sec¬ 
ondary air injection “on” time, optimizing the necessary air flow 
into the exhaust system which reduces the time to catalytic con¬ 
verter light-off.

AUXILIARY FAN CONTROL 


The Auxiliary Fan motor incorporates an out¬ 
put final stage that activates the fan motor at 
variable speeds. 

The auxiliary fan is controlled by ME 7.2. The 
motor output stage receives power and 
ground and activates the motor based on a 
PWM signal (10 - 100 Hz) received from the 
ME 7.2. 

Similar to the aux fan in the E46 with MS 42.0 
control, the fan is activated based on the fol¬ 
lowing factors: 



• Radiator outlet temperature sensor input exceeds a preset temperature. 

• IHKA signalling via the K and CAN bus based on calculated refrigerant pressures. 

• Vehicle speed 

• Battery voltage level 


When the over temperature light in the instrument cluster is on (120°C) the fan is run in the 
overrun function. This signal is provided to the DME via the CAN bus. When this occurs 
the fan is run at a frequency of 10 Hz.

ELECTRIC THROTTLE VALVE (EDK) CONTROL 



The throttle valve assembly of the M62 TU is an 
electric throttle valve (EDK) controlled by an inte¬ 
gral EML function of the ME 7.2. 


The throttle plate is positioned by a gear reduction 
DC motor drive. 


The motor is controlled by proportionately 
switched high/low PWM signals at a basic fre¬ 
quency of 2000 Hz. 


Engine idle speed control is a function of the EDK. 

Therefore, the M62 TU does not require a separate 
idle control valve.

DM-TL (DIAGNOSIS MODULE - TANK LEAKAGE) 

INTRODUCTION 


A new Fuel System Leak Diagnosis Pump is equipped on the X5. The pump will eventu¬ 
ally replace the current vacuum LDP on all vehicles. 


The pump is manufactured by Bosch to BMW specifications. 


• Bosch ECMs identify the electrical function of the pump as DM-TL.

Functional Overview: 


The DM-TL is located in the drivers side rear 

wheel well in the X5. 

1. In it’s inactive state, filtered fresh air enters the 
evaporative system through the sprung open 
valve of the DM-TL. 

2. When the DME activates the DM-TL for leak 
testing, it first activates only the pump motor. 
This pumps air through a restricter orifice (1.0 
or 0.5 mm) which causes the electric motor to 
draw a specific amperage value. This value is 
equivalent to the size of the restricter. 

3. The solenoid valve is then energized which 
seals the evap system and directs the pump 
output to pressurize the evap system. 



The evap system is detected as having a large leak if the amperage value is not realized, a 
small leak if the same reference amperage is realized or no leak if the amperage value is

FUNCTION 


The DC Motor LDP ensures accurate fuel system leak detection for leaks as small as 
0.5mm (.020”). The pump contains an integral DC motor which is activated directly by the 
engine control module. The ECM monitors the pump motor operating current as the mea¬ 
surement for detecting leaks. 

The pump also contains an ECM controlled change over valve that is energized closed dur¬ 
ing a Leak Diagnosis test. The change over valve is open during all other periods of oper¬ 
ation allowing the fuel system to “breath” through the inlet filter (similar to the full down 
stroke of the current vacuum operated LDP). 



DC MOTOR LDP INACTIVE - NORMAL PURGE VALVE OPERATION 

In it’s inactive state the pump motor and the change over valve of the DC Motor LDP are 
not energized. When purge valve operation occurs filtered air enters the fuel system com¬ 
pensating for engine vacuum drawing on the hydrocarbon vapors stored in the charcoal 
canister.

LEAK DIAGNOSIS TEST PRECONDITIONS 


The DME only initiates a leak diagnosis test every second time the criteria are met. The cri¬ 
teria is as follows: 

• Engine OFF with ignition switched OFF. 

• Engine Control Module still in active state or what is known as “follow up mode” (Main 
Relay energized, control module and DME components online for extended period after 
key off). 

• Prior to Engine/Ignition switch OFF condition, vehicle must have been driven for a min¬ 
imum of 20 minutes. 

• Prior to minimum 20 minute drive, the vehicle must have been OFF for a minimum of 5 
hours. 

• Fuel Tank Capacity must be between 15 and 85% (safe approximation between 1/4 - 
3/4 of a tank). 

• Ambient Air Temperature between -7°C & 35°C (20°F&95°F) 

• Altitude < 2500m (8,202 feet). 

• Battery Voltage between 11.5 and 14.5 Volts 

When these criteria are satisfied every second time, the ECM will start the Fuel System Leak 
Diagnosis Test. The test will typically be carried out once a day i.e. once after driving to 
work in the morning, when driving home in the evening, the criteria are once again met but 
the test is not initiated. The following morning, the test will run again.

LEAK DIAGNOSIS TEST 


PHASE 1- REFERENCE MEASUREMENT 

The ECM activates the pump motor. The pump pulls air from the filtered air inlet and pass¬ 
es it through a precise 0.5mm reference orifice in the pump assembly. 

The ECM simultaneously monitors the pump motor current flow . The motor current raises 
quickly and levels off (stabilizes) due to the orifice restriction. The ECM stores the stabilized 
amperage value in memory. The stored amperage value is the electrical equivalent of a 0.5 
mm (0.020”) leak. 



35 






















































































































































PHASE 2 - LEAK DETECTION 


The ECM energizes the Change Over Valve allowing the pressurized air to enter the fuel sys¬ 
tem through the Charcoal Canister, The ECM monitors the current flow and compares it 
with the stored reference measurement over a duration of time. 



Once the test is concluded, the ECM stops the pump motor and immediately de-energizes 
the change over valve. This allows the stored pressure to vent thorough the charcoal can¬ 
ister trapping hydrocarbon vapor and venting air to atmosphere through the filter.

TEST RESULTS 


The time duration varies between 45 & 270 seconds depending on the resulting leak diag¬ 
nosis test results (developed tank pressure “amperage” / within a specific time period)
