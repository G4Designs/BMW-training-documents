Transmission 


The X5 4.6is is available only with a ZF A5S 440Z 5-speed automatic transmission which 
features modified internal components. Many internal components, including the torque 
convertor have been modified to handle the increased torque and horsepower. The trans¬ 
mission is specific to the X5 4.6is and no other transmission should be substituted. 

Programming of the transmission is also changed to better accommodate the vehicle. 
Transmission management will be by EGS 8.60.2. Transmission diagnostics will be han¬ 
dled in the same manner as other models. 



Brakes 

Front and rear brakes are upgraded on the X5 4.6is. Brake rotor size is increased from the 
13.1 in. front normally found on theX5 4.4 to a size of 14.0 in. on the 4.6is. While rear brake 
rotor diameter remains the same on the 4.6is at 12.8 in., the thickness of the rotor is 
increased and the rear rotor is now ventilated similar to the front rotor. 

With these changes brake calipers, brake rotors and brake pads for both front and rear are 
vehicle specific for the X5 4.6 and similar components from other models may not be inter¬ 
changed.
