Introduction 


Depending on the model and equipment installed, the X5 is equipped with either the high 
version E38/E39 or the base version Instrument Cluster - Driver information systems. The 
wiring harness is similar to the E38/E39 systems with minor changes made for functional 
changes with control modules. 

The X5 continues to make use of multi-information bus communication systems. They offer 
the advantages of: 


A high level of reliability 

Reduction in the size of the harnesses 

Multiple utilization of sensor and signal inputs 

Expanded functions through increased data flow 

Flexibility in configuring the systems 

Reduction in cost 

Expanded diagnostic capabilities 

The CAN bus link to the Instrument Cluster provides expanded communication for all vehi¬ 
cle functions to share engine/drivetrain data with the body electrical systems. The cluster 
is an important link in the system, and vital information is updated fasterto the control mod¬ 
ules.

High Instrument Cluster (IKE) 


The IKE corresponds to the E38/E39 system. It consists of the integrated control elec¬ 
tronics and the Display Unit. The IKE is the data gateway for the I, K and CAN Busses. 
The IKE is also the gateway for diagnostic messages that are sent to and from the DI5 
tester and all of the modules on both the T and "K" busses. 

The "CHECK ENGINE" light nomenclature has 
been changed to "SERVICE ENGINE SOON". 

Redundant data storage for the total mileage 
and service interval indicator is stored in the 

LCM III. 

All gauge functions, warning lamp indicators 
and the matrix display are the same as in the 
E38. The needle of the coolant temperature 
gauge is centered if coolant temperature is 
between 75° C - 115° C. 




The fuel economy indicator returns to its starting point when road speed is reduced to 5 
M PH and doesn’t move again until road speed is above 8 M PH. Certain indicator/warning 
lights are illuminated momentarily when KL15 is switched on as a pre-drive check. The indi¬ 
cators will switch off after 2 seconds or within 1 second after the engine starts.

Base Instrument Cluster 


The base instrument cluster consists offive analog gauges. The processing electronics and 
drivers for the gauges are contained in the cluster. The five gauges include: 


Fuel Gauge 

Speedometer 

Tachometer 

Fuel Economy Gauge 

Coolant Temperature 



62530004 

Three Liquid Crystal Display blocks are provided for the: 

Check Control Display - pictogram 
M ileage, Outside Temperature and BC Display 
Transmission Range and SI Display 

Warning lamps and indicators are positioned to the left and right of the display blocks. The 
number of warning lamps is greater on the base cluster for the display of several check 
control warnings. All of the warning lamps and indicators are LEDs and not replaceable. 
Critical warning lamps use two LEDs for a safety margin. 


5 

















The LEFT DISPLAY BLOCK contains a pictogram for various check control warnings. 
LEDs within the display will illuminate for: 


Lighting failures for headlight (low beam), 
taillight and brake lights. 

Open doors or trunk 

Low washer fluid 



Additional circuits monitored by check control include the engine oil level and transmission 
emergency program. These warnings are indicated by lamps positioned in both indicator 
display areas on the left and right sides on the bottom of the instrument cluster. 


Due to the ability to illuminate multiple warning LEDs, there is no priority displays forthe pic¬ 
togram check control. If multiple faults exist, each corresponding LED will illuminate. 


The LED will remain illuminated as long as the fault exists. The only exception is the wash¬ 
er fluid which will go out 60 seconds after KL 15 is switched ON. 


All check control and lamp control circuits are monitored by the Light Check Module (LCM). 
When failures orfaults exist, the messages are passed to the cluster for display over the K-Bus. 


The MIDDLE BLOCK contains the displays for the Total M ileage, Trip M ileage and Board 
Computer. 


The total mileage is stored in non-volatile mem¬ 
ories in the cluster EEPROM and the LCM . 



The mileage can be displayed with the key off 
for 25 seconds if the mileage reset button is 
pressed. 



Board Computer information can be displayed by pressing the turn signal lever. 


NOTE: The outside temperature is displayed automatically every time the key is switched 
ON. 


6 














The RIGHT BLOCK contains the displays for the automatic transmission driving range and 
the Service Interval Indicator III. The display of the Service Indicatoron the E39 is the same 
as previous systems. 

The processor for the intervals is located in the cluster electronics. However, the process¬ 
ing method for determining interval times 
has changed. The E39 uses the new 
Service Interval III system. Interval times are 
based on fuel consumption instead of 
mileage and starts. This system was intro¬ 
duced on the 1996 E38 - 750il_ and is now 
being phased into the other models. 

Using fuel consumption offers several 
advantages over the previous method for determining oil service. 

First, the processing electronics are less involved in that only one value is needed forthe 
processing. 

Second, the use of fuel consumption is a more accurate method of determining engine 
load and the need for service. 

Third, resetting of the indicator before the scheduled time will not effect the time to the 
next service.

A set volume of fuel (in liters) is stored in the EEPROM of the 
SI. The volume of fuel is dependent on the vehicle and 
engine size. The processor receives the "ti" signal as the 
vehicle is used. As 20% of the stored volume is consumed, 
one of the green LEDs will go out. Each successive 20% of 
fuel consumption will cause the next LED to go out until 
100% of the stored volume has been consumed. At this 
point the yellow LED will come on indicating the service is 
due. At 108% of the volume, the RED LED will illuminate 
indicating an over due service.With each reset (oil service 
ore inspection), the total volume of fuel is restored in the 
EEPROM and the calculation starts over again.

DYNAMIC DIGITAL INPUTS 


DISTANCE SIGNAL- This input is supplied to the cluster by the DSC control module as a 
square wave signal. Pulses from the wheel speed sensors are processed by the DSC mod¬ 
ule to produce this signal. 

The cluster electronics process the input for the cluster display and pass the signal along, 
on the I & K busses, as speed signal "A" for other control modules requiring the vehicle 
speed signal. 

CAN BUS SIGNALING - The CAN bus connection to the instrument cluster is found at 
pins 8, 9 and 10 of the blue 26 pin Elo connector on the back. 


The signals transmitted from over the CAN bus to the instrument cluster include: 


Engine temperature 
Engine rpm 

Ti signal (fuel economy indicator) 

Check engine lamp activation 
Transmission range selector position and 
driving program. 




A malfunction with the 
interface to the instru¬ 
ment cluster could 
cause the DSC and 
transmission fail-safe 
indicators to appear. In 
addition, the instru¬ 
ments affected by the 
signals listed above wil 
be inoperative. 




WHEEL SPEED 
SENSOR 


ruinn 




DIMMER SIGNAL - This is a pulse-width modulated signal from the LCM. It is used to 
control the intensity of the back lighting of the instruments and the LCDs when the lights 
are switched ON. This signal is also output over the "K" Bus.

ANALOG INPUT SIGNALS 


BATTERY VOLTAGE - Battery voltage is monitored by the cluster and a fault is stored if 
the voltage exceeds 16 volts 

FUEL TANK LEVEL - Two lever action sensors are wired in parallel to the cluster. The two 
varying voltage signals are processed by the clusterforfuel gauge and low fuel warning dis¬ 
play. 



A A A A i 



COOLANT TEMPERATURE - A NTC sensor is used to measure coolant temperature, the 
cluster uses this input for temperature gauge display. 

OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE SENSOR - A NTC sensor is used to measure the ambient 
temperature. The signal is processed by the clusterand passed outoverthe K Bus to mod¬ 
ules reguiring this input for processing.

DIGITAL INPUT SIGNALS 


The normal ignition switch terminals (KL R, KL 15 & KL 50) are input to thee cluster. 
Various functions are dependent on ignition switch position. 

STEERING COLUMN SWITCH - As with previous systems the turn signal stalk is used to 
call up BC functions. 


BRAKE PAD WEAR SENSORS The pad sensor ii 
pad warning indicator as in the past. 


puts are used to illuminate the brake 


INSTRUMENT PANEL BUTTON - The reset button is used to reset the trip - odometer 
as in the past. It will also display the mileage, if pressed with the key switched OFF. This 
button is also used for the Base BC/instrument cluster test functions outlined on page 15. 


INPUTS FOR WARNING LAMPS - Various switches are used to signal the cluster for 
warning and indicator lamp illumination.

LIGHT CHECK MODULE III (LCM III) 


The LCM III continues to be installed in the right kick panel. The LCM communicates with 
other modules overthe T and "K" busses. The module itself has been redesigned with new 
semi-conductor final stages that produce less heat in operation. This has allowed for the 
elimination of the protruding heat sink found on the previous LCM . 

Functions ofthe LCM include: 

Monitoring of all check control inputs 

Formation and output of check control messages orsig- 

nals 

Control of all vehicle external lighting 
M omtoring of all external lighting for operation 
Instrument panel illumination dimming (KL 58g) signal 
Control of instrument cluster indicator lights - for high 
beam, turn signal and fog light indicators.

HIGH CLUSTER CONFIGURATION 


BASE CLUSTER CONFIGURATION 


For Proper Operation ofthe check control and lamp control functions, the LCM must be 
coded with the Central Key (ZC5) if replacement is required.

LAMP CONTROL/MONITORING 


Lamp control and monitoring on the X5 follows the E38 in design and function. All exterior 
lighting is controlled by the LC M . It contains transistor power output stages for activating 
the lights. This eliminates the need for fuses and relays previously used for this purpose. 

The LCM receives the input request for light illumination from the various switches and data 
inputs from other control modules. The LCM then switches the power output stages ON 
for lamp activation. 

Other control modules that communicate with the LCM include: 


IKE over the l/K bus for turn signal, highbeam and fog lamp indicator illumination. 


The ZKE for crash alarm indication. 


The AGS control module for back up lamp activation. 

All exterior lighting is monitored (both hot and cold) by the LCM. When the monitored val¬ 
ue exceeds an acceptable level (high or low) the LCM generates and sends the signal to 
the IKE or base instrument cluster for check control display. 

Hot monitoring takes place from the LCM by monitoring the current flow through the 
output stages. 


Cold monitoring takes place by the LCM by briefly switching the lights ON and moni¬ 
toring the current flow through the output stages. This is not enough to cause the lights 
to illuminate. 


For safety purposes, the LCM is designed with emergency functions. A LCM failure will still 
allow various lamps to function for safety purposes. These lamps include: 


HOT MONITORING 


COLD MONITORING 



Side marker/tail 
lights 

Low beam head¬ 
lights 

Brake lights 
Turn signal lights 


























REPLACEMENT LIGHTING 

The LCM uses substitute bulbs for various lights if a failure should occur, for example: 

Front Parking Lights: If one of the parking lamps should fail, the LCM will illuminate the 
turn signal bulb on the affected side. The lamp will be dimmed by the LCM so thatthe inten¬ 
sity is the same as the parking lamp. 

Tailights: If one of the taillights should fail, the LCM will switch on the brake 
lamp on the affected side. The lamp will be dimmed to the intensity of the tail lamp. 

OUTPUT VOLTAGE LIMITING FUNCTION 


The output voltage applied to the parking and tail lamps is regulated to increase the life of 
the lamps. If the voltage at the LC M increases over 12,5 volts, the LC M will reduce the volt¬ 
age to 12 volts. 


FOLLOW ME HOME LIGHTING 


This convenience feature provides lighting for the driver and passengers to leave the vehi¬ 
cle and enter their homes. 

The feature is switched "ON" by pulling the headlight flasher switch afterthe headlights and 
ignition have been switched OFF. The feature is switched OFF after a coded time delay or 
by switching the ignition ON.

REDUNDANT DATA STORAGE 


The specific information stored redundantly includes: 


Vehicle ID number 
Total mileage 
Service Interval data 

The data is stored in the cluster 
and in the Light Check Module 
(LCM). The storage of this data 
follows the redundant storage 
of the E38. It prevents the loss 
of total mileage or SI data in the 
event of a cluster processor 
failure.

MANIPULATION DOT 


The data is compared each time KL 15 is switched ON. If the data does not match, the 

manipulation DOT in the mileage display is illuminated. 

Because of this redundant storage feature, the following points must be noted: 

1. If the vehicle ID number is not the same in both modules, the manipulation DOT is illu¬ 
minated and no data transfer takes place. All functions of both modules will continue to 
operate. 

2. Data will only be accepted by the clusterfrom the LCM if the ID numbers match and the 
cluster mileage is zero. 

3. The vehicle ID number is input into the cluster through coding and will only be accept¬ 
ed when the cluster is at zero mileage. 

4. The LCM stored mileage can only be overwritten with a higher mileage and is updated 
even/ 60 miles. 

5. If the mileage differs by more than 120, and the ID numbers are the same, the cluster 
will continue recording the mileage and set a fault for data transfer. 

6. If the I Bus link to the LCM fails, the cluster will continue to record mileage and store a 
fault for the data link. 


These conditions will only allow new components to be installed for replacement purpos¬ 
es. However, a used component can be installed fortesting purposes. If a clusterfrom 
another vehicle is used fortesting purposes, road testing of the vehicle should be avoided, 
because the cluster will accumulate mileage. 


17 


































CHECK CONTROL (High Cluster) 

The Check Control system corresponds to that of the E38/E39 in function and operation. 
The LCM collects and evaluates all check control data inputs from the various switches and 
sensors. This includes the lamp monitoring function within the same module. The failure or 
warning messages are formed in the LCD and transmitted to the IKE over the T bus for 
display in the cluster matrix. 

The cluster matrix contains a 20 character display field for posting messages. Failures and 
warnings are prioritized for display following the same criteria as the E38. 

Priority PI - Critical or important warnings that cannot be canceled with the CC button. 



Priority P2 - Messages that are displayed when KL 15 is switched on for a maximum of 
23 seconds or when the failure occurs for while driving. 



Priority P3 - Messages that are only displayed at the start of or end of a trip. 



Special Warnings: These are top priority messages and won't be overridden when dis¬ 
played. Seatbelt, ignition key in lock with door open are some of these messages. 





The CC button or steering column switch can be used to call up or 
cancel P2 or P3 messages. 

The language of the check control display is set with the central cod¬ 
ing key and cannot be changed by the driver.

A freeze warning is incorporated in the BC. If the temperature drops below 37°F, the gong 
will sound and the temperature display will flash in the BC. Pressing the turn signal lever will 
cancel the display. 


The temperature display in the base on board computer can be switched from Fahrenheit 
to Celsius by pressing the instrument cluster button and holding it while cycling the ignition 
key. During this procedure, the base instrument cluster also produces a "temperature 
changeover signal" on the K-bus for the IH KA to switch over the control panel/module to 
match the display in the instrument cluster. This feature is only available with the base 
instrument cluster. 


Two of the displays "Average Fuel Consumption" and "Average Speed" can be reset to start 
new calculations. To reset the displays, press and hold the turn signal lever, for longer than 
one second, when the function is called up. The BC will than start to compute a new aver-

HEATED STEERING WHEEL 


The heated steering wheel system consists of the following components: 


A heating filament integrated into the steering 
wheel cover. 


An NTC temperature sensor, in the filament circuit, 
to regulate the heating current. 

A push button mounted in the right side M FL key 
pad. 

The control module located behind the air bag 
assembly. 



Slip ring assembly for the power and ground supply. 


OPERATION 


When KL 15 is switched ON, the heated wheel can be switched ON by pressing the but¬ 
ton. A green LED illuminates to indicate system operation. M aximum current is supplied and 
heats the filament to its operating temperature (surface temperature of approximately 90°F). 
The NTC detects the temperature of the filament and causes the control module to cycle 
once the wheel is heated. Cycling is carried out with a pulse width modulated signal. 

The system is not connected to the diagnostic link, howeverthe control module does mon¬ 
itor operation of the system. If a fault occurs during operation, the system and green LED 
will switch OFF.
