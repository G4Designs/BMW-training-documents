S55 Engine 
1. Introduction 

1.1. Highlights 

The S55 engine is the successor to the S65 engine. Similar to the engines in the X5M, X6M, Fix M5/ 
M6 and F06 M6 with S63 engine, the S55 is based on a production engine of BMW AG. As the engine 
identification highlights, the S55 engine is based on the N55 engine. 

In contrast to the previous model, with its V8 naturally aspirated engine, the new BMW M3 and 
M4 Coupe are driven by a 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder gasoline engine with M TwinPower turbo technology. 
Technical updates and M GmbH modifications make the engine suitable for motor racing. 

Thanks to turbocharging and the high-speed concept, the new M engine impresses with an 
unforeseen power development of 317 kW/425 HP and, in contrast to the S65, is readily available at 
considerably lower engine speeds. The maximum torque, a sign of the power development felt by the 
driver, increased by 37% from 400 Nm/295 Ib-ft to 550 Nm/406 Ib-ft, and is available across almost the 
entire usable engine speed range. Even though the S55 has increased power output, with the help of 
BMW EfficientDynamics measures, fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions were reduced by 28% and 
26% respectively. 

As the S55 engine is based on the N55 engine, 75% of the engine components were adopted from 
the N55 production engine and the other 25% of the engine components are new developments. All 
the technical data is above that of the predecessor. 

The S55 engine also contributes to the overall concept of intelligent lightweight construction in the 
F80/F82. Through the intelligent use of material, the weight of the S55 engine was reduced by 3% in 
comparison to the S65 engine.

S55 Engine 
4. Engine Mechanical 

4.1. Engine housing 

The engine housing includes the engine block (crankcase and bedplate), cylinder head, cylinder head 
cover, oil sump, and gaskets. 

4.1.1. Engine block 

The engine block is made from die-cast aluminum alloy (AlSi 7Cu0.5Mg) and consists of a crankcase 
and bedplate. 

Crankcase and bedplate 

The crankcase of the S55 engine is designed as a Closed Deck crankcase, while the N55 is an open 
deck design. It does not have moulded cylinder liners made from cast iron like the N55 engine, but 
LDS-coated aluminium cylinder liners. For more information on electric arc wire spraying (LDS) please 
refer to the "ST 1111 N20 Engine" Technical Reference Manual. 

This material combination lightened the S55 engine block by 2.2kg/4.85lbs in comparison to the 
production engine (N55). This weight savings benefits the intelligent lightweight construction of the 
F80/F82-M3/M4 Coupe. 

With a closed deck crankcase design, the openings for the crankcase cover plate are reduced and 
result in the increase of overall crankcase rigidity. 

As a mechanical coolant pump is used in the S55 engine, the coolant ducts and the fixture for the 
coolant pump are inserted in the crankcase. 

In addition, the mounting points for the S55 engine-specific auxiliary components have been adapted 
to the crankcase.

S55 engine, ventilation holes in the crankcase 


The crankcase has longitudinal ventilation holes bored between the lower chambers of the cylinders. 
These ventilation holes improve the pressure equalization of the oscillating air columns created by the 
up and down strokes of the pistons.

4.1.2. Cylinder head 

The cylinder head of the S55 engine has been modified to motor racing requirements. The basic 
structure of the cylinder head is similar to that of the N55 engine. The S55 6-cylinder engine also uses 
direct fuel injection with exhaust turbocharging and Valvetronic. The cylinder head is very compact and 
is equipped with the 3rd generation Valvetronic. 

A 

The combination of exhaust turbocharger, Valvetronic and direct fuel injection is known as Turbo 
Valvetronic Direct Injection (TVDI). 


TVDI technology reduces C0 2 emission and fuel consumption by 3-6%. 

The connections for the VANOS non-return valves were removed like in the N55 engine, as they have 
been integrated in the solenoid valves. The cylinder head also features coolant passages around the 
injectors for indirect cooling.

4.1.3. Cylinder head cover 


Design 

The cylinder head cover is a modified part from the N55 engine. Unlike the N55 cylinder head cover, 
the S55 cylinder head cover no longer has a built in accumulator for the vacuum system. 

The general operating principle of the crankcase ventilation in the cylinder head cover has not 
changed from a technical viewpoint. 

All the components for crankcase ventilation and the blow-by ducts are integrated in the cylinder head 
cover. The integrated non-return valves ensure that the blow-by gases are reliably supplied to the 
intake air in both engine modes (NA and Boost). 


The S55 engine is equipped with a vacuum-controlled crankcase ventilation system. A vacuum of 
approximately 38 mbar is regulated.

Crankcase ventilation line 

A 

The crankcase ventilation line cannot be replaced individually, only together with the cylinder head 
cover. 


The blow-by gases reach a settling chamber in the cylinder head cover through an opening in the 
rear of the cover. The blow-by gases are then directed through holes on an impact plate which the oil 
hits, at a high flow rate, and drains down. The blow-by gases, cleaned of oil, now flow via the pressure 
control valve through the non return valves (depending on the operating mode) to the charge air intake 
pipe before the exhaust turbocharger or to the intake manifold before the intake valves. The separated 
oil is directed via return duct to the oil sump. 

Function 

Naturally Aspirated Mode 

The standard function can only be utilized while there is a vacuum in the intake manifold, i.e. in 
naturally aspirated mode. 

In naturally aspirated mode, the non-return valves in the blow-by duct of the cylinder head cover are 
opened by the vacuum in the intake plenum and the blow-by gases are drawn off via the pressure 
control valve. The vacuum simultaneously closes the second non-return valve in the duct to the 
charge-air intake line. 

Blow-by gases are routed directly into the cylinder head intake ports via the distribution rail integrated 
in the cylinder head cover.

Boost Mode 

Once the pressure in the intake manifold rises, it is no longer possible for the blow-by gases to be 
introduced via passages in the cylinder head. Otherwise, this would create the risk of the charging 
pressure being introduced into the crankcase. A non-return valve in the blow-by duct of the cylinder 
head cover closes the duct to the intake plenum and thereby protects the crankcase against excess 
pressure. 

The now increased demand for fresh air generates a vacuum in the clean air pipe between the exhaust 
turbocharger and the intake silencer. This vacuum is sufficient to open the non-return valve and to 
extract the blow-by gases via the pressure control valve.

If there is a complaint of high oil consumption and oil is found in the turbocharger, it should not be 
immediately concluded that the turbocharger is faulty. If oil is present in the fresh air pipe before the 
turbochargers, then the entire engine must be checked for leaks. The cause of an excessive blow- 
by gas flow rate may be faulty gaskets or crankshaft seals. Loose crankshaft seals may generate oil 
consumption of up to 31/1000 km (3.2qt/621miles).

4.1.4. Engine cover 

The engine cover was modified to the S55 engine. The engine cover consists of two independent 
components: 

• the ignition coil cover 

• the corrosion protection cover 

With this design, the engine cover weighs 960 grams (2.1 lbs) less than the N55 engine cover.

The oil pan of the S55 engine is made from magnesium and results in a weight savings of 
approximately 1000 grams (2.2lbs) in comparison to the aluminium oil pan in the N55 engine. An 
additional cover in the oil pan restricts the oil movements during longitudinal and lateral acceleration.

4.2. Crankshaft 

4.2.1. Crankshaft with bearings 

Crankshaft 

While maintaining a lightweight construction, the forged steel crankshaft was adapted to the high¬ 
speed concept and increased power. At 21.1 kg (46.5 lbs), the crankshaft of the S55 engine is 
approximately 1.8 kg (4 lbs) lighter than the steel crankshaft of the N5530B0 (M235i) engine and 1 kg 
(2.2 lbs) heavier than the cast iron crankshaft of the N55B30M0 (standard) engine. The crankshaft is 
made from a steel alloy (42CrMoS4 Mod) and is then nitrocarburized (hardened). The counterweight 
arrangement is symmetrical, while the cast iron N55 engine crankshaft counterweight arrangement is 
asymmetrical. 

There is no increment wheel installed on the crankshaft, similar to the N55 engine. The crankshaft 
speed is determined by a magnetic wheel and crankshaft speed sensor, based on the hall principle. 
The timing chains are connected by a M18 central bolt.

Crankshaft main bearing 

The crankshaft main bearings were modified, from the N55 engine, in order to satisfy the high¬ 
speed concept requirements. The bearings are lead-free. A three-material (Kolbenschmidt S703C) 
electroplated bearing is used for the lower bearing shells. For the upper bearing shells, a two-material 
bearing made from aluminium (Kolbenschmidt R25) is used. The thrust bearing is located at the fourth 
bearing position. 

4.2.2. Connecting rod with bearing 

The connecting rod of the S55 engine has an inside diameter of 144.35 mm. Like in the N20-N55 
engines, the small end of the connecting rod has a specially shaped bore. It is machined wider on the 
lower edges. This design evenly distributes the force acting on the wrist pin over the entire surface of 
the rod bushing and reduces the load on the edges, as the piston moves downward, during the power 
stroke.

4.2.3. Piston and piston rings 

The piston was modified in its styling and material properties to the higher requirements of the high¬ 
speed concept in the S55 engine. 

A full slipper skirt piston manufactured by the Mahle company is used. The piston is made from an 
aluminium alloy (AISi12Cu4Ni2Mg). This alloy is particularly suitable for high-performance gasoline 
engines. 

The piston skirt is Grafal-coated. This is necessary due to the LDS-coated cylinder liners. 

The piston diameter is 84 mm. The first piston ring is a nitride plain rectangular compression ring. The 
second piston ring is a taper-faced piston ring. The oil scraper ring is a nitride ES oil scraper ring.

Wrist pin 

The wrist pin was revised accordingly to the higher requirements in the S55 engine. The material and 
the strength was upgraded to satisfy the high-speed concept. 

A wrist pin with restricted volume change and a 22 mm diameter is used. This wrist pin is made from a 
steel alloy (16MnCr5) and then case-hardened. 

Combustion chamber geometry 

The following graphic shows the arrangement of the individual components around the combustion 
chamber. From the graphic, one can see that the BMW high precision injection (HPI) is not used, 
but rather a Bosch solenoid valve fuel injector with a multi-hole nozzle. This fuel injector is specially 
adapted to the combination of turbocharging and Valvetronic III. For a clearer overview, a set of valves 
has been removed in the graphic.

N54 engine the use of lightweight construction camshafts and cast camshafts or a mixed installation is 
possible. 

In the S55 engine, similar to the N55 engine, only lightweight construction camshafts are used. 

The lightweight construction camshafts for the S55 engine are manufactured by hydroforming. 

The exhaust camshaft has bearing races and is enclosed in a camshaft housing. Oil foaming during 
operation is reduced by the camshaft housing.

5.1.3. Intake and exhaust valves 

The valve stem of the intake valves has a diameter of 5 mm and the exhaust valves have a diameter of 
6 mm. The reason for the larger diameter is that the exhaust valve is hollow and is filled with sodium, 
which improves heat transfer. In addition, the valve seat of the exhaust valve is reinforced. 

5.1.4. Valve springs 

Due to the different shaft diameters between the intake and exhaust valves, the valve springs are

The VANOS of the S55 engine corresponds in its design and function to that of the N55 engine. In 
the N55 engine the VANOS was optimized in comparison to the N54 engine. This optimization now 
provides for even faster VANOS unit adjustment speeds. The modification has also further reduced the 
system's susceptibility to fouling.

Overview 

As can be seen from the following graphic, the installation location of the servomotor has not changed 
in comparison to the N55 engine. Another special feature is that the eccentric shaft sensor no longer 
sits at the eccentric shaft, but has been integrated in the servomotor. 

Due to the higher engine speeds of up to 7,600 rpm, the work curve of the eccentric shaft has been 
modified.

Valvetronic III is used. The differences between Valvetronic III and Valvetronic II are in the arrangement 
of the Valvetronic servomotor and the Valvetronic sensor. As in Valvetronic II, the turbulence level is 
increased at the end of the compression cycle for the purpose of optimizing the mixture formation 
with the use of phasing and masking measures. This movement of the cylinder charge improves the 
combustion during partial load operation and in catalytic converter heating mode. The quench areas 
also contribute to the mixture formation. 

Phasing 

Phasing results in a lift difference between both intake valves of up to 1.8 mm in the lower partial load 
range. The fresh air drawn in is thus distributed unequally. 

Masking 

Masking refers to the styling of the valve seat area. This styling ensures that the incoming fresh air is 
aligned so that the desired cylinder charging movement is achieved. The advantage of these measures 
is that the combustion delay (retardation) is reduced by approximately 10° of crankshaft rotation. The 
combustion process is quicker and a larger valve overlap can be realized. The NO x emissions can thus 
be reduced significantly.

Turbulent kinetic energy 


Engine response characteristics can be improved with the combination of Valvetronic III, direct fuel 
injection and turbocharging. The response characteristics up to the naturally aspirated engine full 
load are shortened, as with the naturally aspirated engine with Valvetronic, as the filling procedure of 
the intake manifold is deleted. The subsequent torque build-up as the turbocharger starts up can be 
accelerated at low engine speeds with a partial lift adjustment. The flushing of the residual gas leads to 
a quicker build-up of the torque.

Valvetronic 

A brushless direct current motor is used, as in the N55 engine. The Valvetronic servomotor has the 
following special features: 

• Open concept (engine oil is supplied directly to the motor) 

• The eccentric shaft angle is determined by angle increments from the integrated sensor 
system 

• Power consumption reduced by approximately 50% 

• Higher actuating dynamics (e.g. cylinder-specific adjustment, idle speed control, etc.) 

• Lightweight design - approximately 600 grams 

The third generation of the Valvetronic servomotor also includes the sensor for identifying the 
position of the eccentric shaft. Another special feature is that engine oil flows through and around the 
Valvetronic servomotor. An oil spray nozzle ensures that the worm gear is lubricated for the eccentric 
shaft connection.

6.1. Belt drive 


The belt drive had to be modified due to the use of a mechanical coolant pump and deletion of the 
hydraulic power steering pump. An additional tensioning pulley is used between the vibration damper 
and the air conditioning compressor, which compensates for the deletion of the hydraulic power 
steering pump. The additional tensioning pulley suppresses possible oscillations of the drive belt 
between the vibration damper and air conditioning compressor.

The integrated oil deflector gives rise to the largest possible cavity sealing between the oil pan and 
crankshaft drive. Additional oil scraper edges are fitted at the bedplate which direct oil spray from the 
crankshaft. 

The oil flowing back from the cylinder head is directed under the oil deflector. This way, even at high 
lateral acceleration, no returning oil can reach the crankshaft and cause churning losses.

7. Oil Supply 

With these changes the oil supply can be guaranteed up to a longitudinal acceleration of 0.61 g and 
down to -1.2 g in the case of deceleration. Also with lateral acceleration, for example during cornering, 
this oil supply system enables a secure oil supply up to a constant 1.2 g.

Index Explanation

B Lateral acceleration (dynamic cornering) 

1 Engine oil level during braking and cornering 

2 Oil pan 


With the intake pipes (2,4,8), the suction pump draws oil from the front of the oil pan during 
longitudinal acceleration and from the sides of the oil pan during lateral acceleration. The oil drawn in 
is delivered by the return flow (6) back to the rear part of the oil pan. There the oil pump can re-absorb 
the oil via the oil deflector with intake pipe (7) and deliver it to the engine lubrication points. 

The bearings of the exhaust turbochargers may collect engine oil due to the centrifugal force during 
lateral acceleration conditions. This prevents a normal backflow to the oil pan and thus a supply of 
fresh cool engine oil to the bearings. 

To counteract this effect, the bearings of the exhaust turbochargers have engine oil continuously 
drawn in by the suction pump and delivered to the oil pan.

The suction pump is a twin-flow gear pump. The outer chambers of the gear pump serve as suction 
chambers. At the suction chambers the intake pipes are connected which consist of the oil return lines 
from the exhaust turbochargers and the intake pipes at the front oil pan. 

The inner chamber is a pressure chamber. The pressure chamber delivers the engine oil back to the 
rear of the oil pan via the return flow. Engine oil in the rear of the oil pan is thus available again to the oil 
pump via the intake pipe.

7.1.5. Oil filter and engine oil cooling 

The oil filter housing is made from aluminium. For the engine oil cooling an upstream engine oil cooler 
is used which is installed in a horizontal position in front of the radiator package. Depending on the 
engine oil temperature, a thermostat at the oil filter housing enables the oil flow to the engine oil cooler. 

Due to the higher engine performance, a large heat quantity must be dissipated by the engine oil 
cooler. The opening range of the thermostat is therefore earlier than in the N55 engine.

7.1.6. Oil spray nozzles 

The S55 engine has oil spray nozzles for the piston crown cooling. They are common parts to the N55 
engine. A special tool is required for the positioning of the oil spray nozzles. 

7.1.7. Engine oil pressure monitoring 

Oil pressure 

Since the S55 engine has a electronic volume controlled oil pump, it is necessary to record the oil 
pressure precisely. This is why a new sensor (Puls2) is used. 

The advantages of the new sensor are: 

• Measurement of the absolute pressure (previous sensor measured relative pressure) 

• Characteristic map control possible at every engine speed. 

Oil level 

The familiar oil-level sensor is used for the oil level measurement.

8. Air Intake & Exhaust Emission Systems 

8.1. Air intake system 

8.1.1. Overview 

For the S55 engine, the air intake system had to be completely revamped. The following are the 
components that were revamped: 

• Air intake duct up to the intake silencer 

• Clean air duct, due to new exhaust turbochargers, completely new 

• Crankcase venting components 

• Indirect charge air cooling 

• Recirculation air system deleted 

• Tank ventilation system adapted 

As can be seen from the graphic, the structure of the intake air system is more comprehensive, as two 
exhaust turbochargers are installed and indirect charge air cooling is used.

A blow-off valve is no longer required due to the modified engine control. 

Similar to the S63 top (S63TU) engine, the undesired spikes in charging pressure, which may arise 
in the event of quick throttle valve closure, are reduced . The electrical wastegate valves also play an 
important role in terms of the engine acoustics and contribute to the component protection of the 
turbochargers.

8.2. Exhaust emission system 

8.2.1. Overview 

The S55 engine has a different exhaust system structure than in the N55 engine. It uses two mono¬ 
scroll turbochargers instead of the single twin-scroll turbocharger of the N55. The exhaust system is 
a twin-pipe system in relation to the cylinder banks 1 and 2. In addition to the two catalytic converters 
(3/5) located close to the engine, two underbody catalytic converters (7/8) with a twin-pipe center 
silencer (9) and a rear silencer (10) are also installed. 

The exhaust system was designed for minimum exhaust back pressure. The gas exchange efficiency 
was further optimized by sport tuning and intelligent lightweight construction. The weight was able to 
be reduced through selective wall thickness reduction.

The pneumatic exhaust flaps were replaced, in the S55 engine, with electrical exhaust flaps. This 
simplifies the vacuum system and the vacuum reservoir in the cylinder head cover could therefore be 
deleted. The electrical exhaust flaps are activated directly by the DME by a pulse-width modulated 
signal.

S55 Engine 

8. Air Intake & Exhaust Emission Systems 

The exhaust flap can be opened by a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal of 10% and closed with a 
signal of 90% . The end positions are the mechanical limit positions of the exhaust flap. Intermediate 
settings are not intended. The exhaust flap can be moved to the service position for installation by a 
PWM signal of 50%. To guarantee the desired position, in the case of extended non-operation of the 
electrical exhaust flap actuator, every 320 s (+/-10%) a current is applied, which works in the direction 
of the limit position (duration of current feed: 50 ms +/- 5 ms). 

Functional input variables for the calculation of the exhaust flap setting are: 

• Vehicle speed 

• Accelerator pedal angle 

• Engine temperature 

• Transmission version 

• Gear mode 

There is always a flow through the two tailpipe pairs by the bypass pipe (1+2) regardless of the flap 
position. Therefore, no varying blackening of the two tailpipe pairs occurs, which is typical of vehicles 
with exhaust flaps. Furthermore, the exhaust flaps are not visible at the tailpipes. 

Together with the Active Sound Design (ASD) and the electrical exhaust flaps, an optimal sound 
setting can be generated in every operating condition of the S55 engine, in the new M3/M4 Coupe. 
This results in a dominant, recognizable sound typical of BMW M vehicles. The character of the sound 
can vary depending on what mode the driver selects via the engine dynamics button. The three modes 
of the engine dynamics are Normal, Sport, and Sport+. 

8.2.2. Exhaust manifold 

The exhaust manifold is made from high-alloyed cast steel. One exhaust manifold is used for each 
bank, similar to the N54 engine. The condensing of the three exhaust ducts into a single exhaust duct 
results in an optimal flow to the turbine of the turbocharger. The exhaust manifold and turbine housing 
of the turbocharger are cast together, forming one component/unit.

retained at the weight of the one twin-scroll turbocharger in the N55 engine. For comparison: The 
twin-scroll turbocharger unit in the N55 weighs 14.1 kg (31.1 lbs), the mono-scroll turbocharger units 
in the S55 engine weigh 14.2 kg (31.3 lbs).

Electrical wastegate valve 

The S55 engine is equipped with electrical wastegate valves, unlike the N54 which has the pneumatic 
design. The function of the electrical wastegate valves in the S55 engine is the same as in other BMW 
engines equipped with these valves. One important function is to satisfy ULEV2 emission standards. 

The main advantages of the electrical wastegate valve compared to the pneumatic wastegate valve 
are: 


• High adjustment speed 

• Precise boost pressure control 

• High closing force, thus less leakage and quicker build-up of boost pressure 

• Complete opening of the wastegate valve possible (This supports quick heating of catalytic 
converter upon cold start) 

• Lower exhaust emissions 

• Fuel economy 

The electrical wastegate valve is activated directly via the DME by a pulse-width modulated signal.

S55 Engine 
10. Fuel System 

10.1. Overview 

The S55 engine uses the high-pressure fuel injection system (HDE), similar to the N55 engine. Instead 
of the high precision injectors (HPI) known from the N54 and N63 engines, solenoid valve fuel injectors 
with multi-hole nozzles are used in the S55 engine. 

The following overview shows the entire fuel injection system. The fuel preparation of the S55 
engine is closely related to the fuel preparation of the N55 engine. In the S55 engine, a new double¬ 
piston high pressure fuel pump is used, whereas the N55 engine has a single-piston high pressure 
pump. This is necessary in order to provide for the higher fuel demand needed with the increased 
performance and engine speeds of the S55 engine. The high pressure fuel injection valves meet the 
exhaust emission standards ULEV2. The S55 uses high pressure fuel injection valves from Bosch with 
the designation HDEV5.2, which also support the Controlled Valve Operation (CVO) function.

The fuel is supplied to the high pressure fuel pumps by the in tank electric fuel pump through a feed 
line at a primary pressure of 5 bar. The primary pressure is monitored via the low pressure fuel sensor. 
This low pressure fuel sensor is known from the N55, N54, and N63 engines. 

In the event of a failed low pressure fuel sensor, the electric fuel pump continues to operate at 100% 
delivery rate with terminal 15 ON.

10.1.2. High pressure fuel pumps 

The high pressure fuel pumps, known from the N20 and N63 engines, are bolted into the vacuum 
pump housing. The vacuum pump drive shaft runs the entire length of the vacuum pump housing and 
acts as a camshaft with two three-point lobes (triple lobes) to drive the high pressure fuel pumps. 

Each point of the three-point lobes is offset by 120° degrees. The two three-point lobes, which drive 
the two high pressure pumps, are arranged so that there is a delivery every 60° degrees. 

The high pressure fuel pump, HDP 5, is used and has the same function as the high pressure pump in 
the N55 engine. 

However, for the S55 engine, two high pressure pumps are installed in parallel and the fuel lines are 
arranged differently. Below approx. 3,000 rpm only one high pressure pump is activated, at engine 
speeds above approx. 3,000 rpm both high pressure pumps are active. This was necessary in order to 
satisfy the higher volume of fuel needed at high engine speeds and loads. Regulation is carried out by 
the quantity control valve of the second high pressure pump. The quantity control valves, of the high 
pressure pumps, are controlled by a pulse-width-modulated signal from the DME.

An additional sensor detects the position of the camshaft that drives the high pressure fuel pumps. 
The position of the camshaft in the high pressure pump is required in order to optimize the pump 
control by the quantity control valves. 

The position sensor works according to the hall effect principle. It tracks the sensor gear electronically 
and sends the signal to the DME which in turn activates the quantity control valves for the fuel quantity 
control. 

The double three-point lobe camshaft is permanently driven by the vacuum pump. The fuel is 
pressurized by the high pressure fuel pumps and delivered to the fuel rail via the two high pressure 
lines. The fuel stored under pressure in the fuel rail is distributed via the high pressure lines to the 
high-pressure fuel injection valves. The required fuel pressure is determined by the DME according to 
the engine load and speed. The fuel pressure is registered by the rail pressure sensor and sent to the 
DME. The fuel is regulated by the quantity control valve, on high pressure pump 2, based on a target/ 
actual value comparison of the rail pressure. The fuel pressure is adjusted to achieve smooth running 
properties with the best possible fuel consumption. The maximum pressure of 200 bar is only required 
at a high load and low speed.

Warning for working on the high-pressure fuel system 


10.1.3. Fuel Injectors 

The Bosch HDEV5.2 solenoid valve fuel injectors are used in the S55, like in the N20 and N55 engines. 
The solenoid valve fuel injectors are designed as inward-opening multi-hole valves with highly variable 
spay angle and spray pattern. They are designed for system pressure of up to 200 bar. 

The high-pressure fuel injection valves help satisfy ULEV2 emission standards. 

The high-pressure fuel injection valves have different diameters of the laser-manufactured bore holes 
in the nozzles. The fuel quantity of the two spray jets in the exhaust direction is reduced by 20%, 
which increases the other spray jets by 10% respectively.

S55 Engine 
10. Fuel System 

High-pressure fuel injection valves with solenoid coils do not have a linear behavior pattern across the 
entire service life, mainly in the area of minimal quantity fuel injection. This means over time the fuel 
injection rates vary from one injector to another injector. The high-pressure fuel injection valves are 
adapted during start-up by the injection quantity compensation in the DME, in order to compensate 
possible manufacturing tolerances and adjust all injectors to each other. 

However, this only happens once during start-up (injection quantity compensation). The parameters 
for the activation of the injectors such as current and activation duration are the same for all injectors 
during the entire operating time and cannot be individually adapted. During the operating time, this 
would lead to transgressions from the strict exhaust gas emissions legislation such as ULEV2.

The injectors are now therefore adjusted over the operating time with the help of a software function 
called "Controlled Valve Operation" (CVO) in the DME. The aim here is to limit the deviation of the 
individual injectors to each other to +/-10%.

The basic principle of the CVO function is to determine the precise opening period of the high 
pressure fuel injection valves. The DME can determine the precise opening period using the following 
parameters: 


• Power consumption of the high-pressure fuel injection valve 

• Voltage at the high-pressure fuel injection valve 

These current and voltage values change in the event of a needle movement in the high-pressure fuel 
injection valve, for example: 

• Armature mists up - when the needle valve is withdrawn from the valve seat 

• Armature moves - needle valve moves in direction of open position 

• Armature is stationary - attachment of needle valve at fully open position 

• Reverse movement 

• Armature moves - needle valve moves in direction of closed position 

• Armature suffers impact and is braked hydraulically - needle valve closed

S55 Engine

With these values, the DME can determine the actual opening period of the high-pressure fuel 
injection valve. If the precise opening periods are known, the DME can also determine the exact fuel 
injection rate. 

If the fuel injection rates vary, then the DME can control the fuel injection rate by the opening period 
of each individual injector valve. The DME thus has the option to adjust all high-pressure fuel injection 
valves to the same nominal fuel injection rate. 

This measure guarantees the same nominal fuel injection rate in all cylinders, primarily in the minimal 
quantity range, as well as at idle speed, so that the exhaust recirculation can always work efficiently. 
This is reflected in the emissions values and compliance with the existing exhaust emission standards 
ULEV2. 

A_ 

Work on the fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. The coolant temperature 
must not exceed 40 °C. This measure must be observed without fail, as otherwise there is a risk of fuel 
being sprayed back on account of the residual pressure in the high-pressure fuel system. 

When working on the high-pressure fuel system, it is essential to adhere to conditions of absolute 
cleanliness and to observe the work sequences described in the repair instructions. Even the slightest 
contamination and/or damage to the screwed fittings of the high-pressure lines can cause leaks. 

When working on the fuel system of the S55 engine, it is important to ensure that the ignition coils are 
not fouled with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by having contact with 
fuel. This may result in arching on the spark plug head and thus in misfires. 

• Before making any modifications to the fuel system, make sure to remove the ignition coils 
and protect the spark plug holes against of fuel ingress by covering with them with a rag. 

• Before reinstalling the solenoid valve injectors, remove the ignition coils and ensure the best 
cleanliness conditions are maintained. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced. 

• The CVO function comprise the system components "Injector" and "Digital Engine 
Electronics" (DME). These components therefore have to be identified with the vehicle 
identification number in the EPC in the event of a replacement. 

• For injectors and a DME which supports the CVO function, the injection quantity 
compensation during the replacement of one of the components is deleted. 

• The information and repair instructions in the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA) 
must be observed.

Not only does this additional coolant pump operate after engine shut down, but also during engine 
operation taking into account the following factors: 

• Coolant temperature at the engine outlet 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected fuel quantity 

Using these values, the heat input to the engine is calculated. The after-run of the electric coolant 
pump can last up to 30 minutes. To improve the cooling effect, the electric fan is activated and can run 
for up to a maximum of 11 minutes after engine shut down.

S55 Engine 

12. Engine Electrical System 

12.1.3. Engine control unit 

The S55 engine receives the engine control MEVD17.2.G from Bosch. The DME is integrated into the 
intake manifold and is cooled by the intake air. The MEVD17.2.G DME can operate on the FlexRay and 
supplies the sensors and actuators directly with voltage. 

The top side of the DME housing is also the lower section of the intake manifold. The DME housing is 
contoured in order to ensure optimal flow in the intake manifold. 

When connected, the plug connections between the wiring harness and DME are waterproof. 


12.2. Functions 


12.2.1. Fuel supply 

A voltage signal is sent from the low pressure fuel sensor to the DME based on the system pressure 
applied between the electric fuel pump and the high pressure pump. The system pressure (fuel 
pressure) is determined using the low-pressure fuel sensor before the high pressure pump. In the 
DME, a constant comparison of the nominal pressure and the actual pressure is carried out. 

In the event of a deviation of the nominal pressure from the actual pressure, the engine control unit 
increases or reduces the voltage for the electric fuel pump, which is sent as a message via the PT-CAN 
to the electric fuel pump control unit (EKP). 

The electric fuel pump control unit transforms the message into output voltage for the electric fuel 
pump. The necessary delivery pressure for the engine (or the high pressure pumps) is adjusted. In the 
event of a signal failure (low pressure fuel sensor) the electric fuel pump is pre-controlled with terminal 
15 ON. If the CAN bus fails, the electric fuel pump is operated via the electric fuel pump control unit 
with the system voltage. The high pressure pumps increase the fuel pressure between 50 to 200 
bar. The fuel reaches the rail via the high pressure lines. The fuel is stored temporarily in the rail and 
distributed to the fuel injectors. 

Fuel quantity control 

The rail pressure sensor measures the current fuel pressure in the rail. The excess fuel is returned 
to the inlets of the high pressure pumps when the quantity control valves are open. In the event of a 
failure of a high pressure pump, restricted driving is possible. 

The quantity control valves control the fuel pressure in the rail. The quantity control valves are 
activated by the engine control with a pulse-width-modulated signal. Depending on the pulse width, 
a variable throttle cross section is released, thus providing the quantity of fuel required for the current 
load status of the engine There is also an option to reduce the pressure in the rail. 

12.2.2. Charging pressure control 

The charging pressure is controlled by the engine control via the wastegate valves at each of the two 
turbochargers. In order to be able to infinitely adjust the wastegate valves, electrical wastegate valves 
are installed which implement the signals from the engine control to open or close the wastegate 
valve.

S55 Engine 

12. Engine Electrical System 

Oxygen sensor before catalytic converter 

The oxygen sensors (LSU ADV) from Bosch are used as control sensors before the catalytic 
converters. The function is comparable to the oxygen sensor (LSU 4.9) and therefore is not described 
in detail here. This oxygen sensor is already used in the N55 and N63 engine. The abbreviation LSU 
stands for universal oxygen sensor and ADV for “Advanced”. 

The oxygen sensor before catalytic converter (LSU ADV) offers the following advantages: 

• High signal stability, especially in boost operation due to lower dynamic pressure dependence 

• Increased durability thanks to reduced pump voltage 

• Increased accuracy 

• Quicker operating readiness (< 5 seconds) 

• Greater temperature compatibility 

• Improved connector with better contact properties 

The LSU ADV has an extended measuring range, making it possible to measure precisely from lamda 
0.65. The oxygen sensor is operational earlier, so after 5 seconds precise measurement values are 
available. 

The higher measuring dynamics of the sensor makes it possible to more effectively determine and 
control the fuel-air ratio of each cylinder. As a result, a homogeneous exhaust flow can be adjusted, the 
emission levels lowered and the long-term emission behavior optimized. 

Oxygen sensor after catalytic converter 

The oxygen sensor after catalytic converter is also called a monitoring sensor. The monitoring sensor 
LSF XFOUR from Bosch is used. 

The LSF XFOUR needs the MEVD17.2.G for the signal evaluation and is characterized by the following 
properties: 

• Quicker response characteristics after engine start (a more controlled heater was integrated in 
the LSF XFOUR) 

• Improved signal stability 

• Small installation space 

• High temperature resistance and optimal thermal shock protection 

• Resistance against condensation in the exhaust duct after a cold start is improved

The hot film air mass meter 7 is used, like in the N55 engine. The S55 engine uses two hot film air 
mass meters, one for each bank. 

The hot film air mass meter measures the flow of the filtered air which is drawn in by the engine. In 
conjunction with other sensors, the quantity of the fuel to be injected is controlled. The HFM signal is 
also used in other system diagnosis, like fuel tank ventilation. In contrast to the hot film air mass meter

The sensor is supplied with 5 V voltage by the DME. The DME receives signals via five hall effect 
elements and evaluates them. Of the five hall effect sensors three are for rough classification and two 
are for precise classification. The angle of rotation of the servomotor can be determined at <7.5°. With

Work on the fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. The coolant temperature 
must not exceed 40 °C. This measure must be observed without fail, as otherwise there is a risk of fuel 
being sprayed back on account of the residual pressure in the high-pressure fuel system. 

When working on the high-pressure fuel system, it is essential to adhere to conditions of absolute 
cleanliness and to observe the work sequences described in the repair instructions. Even the slightest 
contamination and/or damage to the screwed fittings of the high-pressure lines can cause leaks. 

When working on the fuel system of the S55 engine, it is important to ensure that the ignition coils are 
not fouled with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by having contact with 
fuel. This may result in arching on the spark plug head and thus in misfires. 

• Before making any modifications to the fuel system, make sure to remove the ignition coils 
and protect the spark plug holes against of fuel ingress by covering with them with a rag. 

• Before reinstalling the solenoid valve injectors, remove the ignition coils and ensure the best
