1. Introduction 


The BMW M brand is expanding. In addition to the current BMW M models (the 5-Series, 6-Series and 
X models), for the first time there is also a BMW M4 Coupe with the introduction of the fifth generation 
of the new BMW M3 . 

Similar to all BMW AG vehicles, the BMW M Coupe and the M Convertible body variants will also be 
marketed as a BMW 4-Series in order to clearly distinguish this segment from the Sedans. 

The "4" in the type plate is a visual indicator of how different the new BMW M4 Coupe is to the BMW 
M3 4 door Sedan with its own personality, enhanced sporting character and more exclusivity. 

The new BMW M4 Coupe and the new BMW M3 in the fifth generation were systematically designed 
for lightweight construction. In order to achieve this objective, this lightweight construction concept 
was consistently applied in the body area, as well as in the powertrain and chassis and suspension. 

A composite construction with different material combinations is used in the body, electrical system, 
in the chassis and suspension and the powertrain. Metals such as steel, magnesium and aluminum, as 
well as the use of plastics and fiber composites, are used alternately. 

In contrast to the predecessor where a high-speed 8-cylinder naturally aspirated engine was used, for 
the first time in the BMW M3/M4 Coupe an engine with six cylinders and turbocharging is used as a 
powertrain. 

In the area of the powertrain concept, the BMW M3 and the BMW M4 Coupe thus pursue the same 
strategy as their big brother in the BMW M X-Series, as well as that of the BMW M5/M6, where 
turbocharged engines have been in use for a long time. 

This combination of consistent lightweight construction and turbocharging guarantees that power and 
agility are exceptional and enhances the competitive position of the BMW M3 and BMW M4 Coupe. 

With success embedded in the genes, the new BMW M4 Coupe and the new BMW M3 in the fifth 
generation will celebrate their global premier in June 2014.

1.1.1. E30 M3 

It all started with the first M3, launched as a thoroughbred sports car for the road. Roughly 18,000 
vehicles, Coupe and Convertible. Two four-cylinder four-valve engines were available worldwide. It was 
produced between 1986 -1991 (1988 -1991 in the US market), the first M3 generation turned the 
world of racing upside down. The original M3 also showed its sporting ambitions in its exterior design. 
The flared wheel arches and a large rear spoiler gave it a massive road presence.

Bumper, front 

The bumper panel in the M-specific design has flaps at the bottom for reducing the drive at the front 
axle. It is painted in the vehicle color, including the PDC sensors. Due to the necessary air inlets no fog 
lights are offered. The frame and the double-bridge longitudinal bars of the kidney grill of the BMW M 
radiator grill are standard high-gloss black struts for the M3/M4 Coupe and have the M3/M4 Coupe 
model designation. The optional Side View camera and the Parking Maneuvering Assistant (PMA) 
sensor is integrated at the side similar to the F3x production vehicle. 

In addition, the Air Curtain was integrated in the front bumper panel and the neighboring wheel arch 
panel. The Air Curtain, together with the side gill form part of the integrated Air Breather function. 

The underbody panels, a rear spoiler and the exterior mirrors, contribute to the aerodynamics concept 
of the new M3/M4 Coupe. 

The ornamental grills at the bottom are black-grained.

Engine compartment lid 

In contrast to the F3x M3, the engine compartment lid for the F80/F82 is made from aluminum. 

Six struts were fitted in the middle section to reinforce the engine compartment lid. 

The supporting inner structure, as well as the outer skin of the engine compartment lid, are made from 
aluminum. The sound insulation in the passenger compartment of the engine compartment 
lid is deleted. 

The typical M "power dome" is functional. It provides the space for the indirect charge air cooling 
for the S55B30T0 engine. 

These measures result in weight savings of about 8 kg in comparison to the F3x M3. 

Front end and air ducts 

The air intake duct and the intake silencer, as well as their position, are also new. 



F80/F82 air intake duct and indirect charge air cooler 


There is a new air duct both for the center radiator package and for the upper low-temperature radiator 
and the two radiators in the wheel arches. For rigidity reasons the lower engine compartment shield 
is a one-piece design. It includes the air duct of the horizontal engine oil cooler and optimizes its flow. 
The lower bumper support comprises a plastic component which saves on weight and is secured 
to the M3/M4 Coupe deformation elements. The shaped element in the upper bumper support is 
adapted to the shape of the M3/M4 Coupe bumper panel. 

The low design of the front end including the engine compartment lid form part of the passive 
pedestrian protection.

Front fenders 

The front fenders of the F80/F82 are made from aluminum. There is an overall weight saving of 2.6 kg 
for the two fenders in comparison to the steel fenders of the F3x M3. 

Striking design feature include the M gills and the M3/M4 Coupe model inscription on the left/right 
front fenders. In addition, for the first time in a BMW M vehicle the Air Breathers are used on the left 
and right in the fenders, which were integrated in the typical M gill. 

The front fenders are also new due to the tire clearance. The fender flares were enlarged about 28 mm 
for the F80 compared to the F30 and about 18 mm from the F82 compared to the F32. 

Rear fender 

The rear fender is also new due to the tire clearance. 

Wheel arch cover 

The wheel arch cover and the covers of the steering units are adapted to the new fenders.

Roof 

The roof operating unit for the F80/F82 is made from a carbon fiber structure and is connected to the 
body by bonding. The roof line has an aerodynamic outline in the middle section, thus highlighting the 
sporting character of the new M3/M4 Coupe. 

For the first time a CFRP roof is also used for a M3 Sedan. If the customer decides in favor of an 
electrical glass sunroof in the new M3/M4 Coupe, the CFRP roof is deleted and a steel roof, 
similar to the F3x M3, is installed. 

The production of the CFRP roof is done as a multi-layer design in the RMT process (transfer 
moulding) and is sealed with a layer of clear coat. In comparison to the standard steel roof, 
this CFRP roof saves about 5 kg in weight in the M3 and about 6.5 kg in the M4 Coupe. 

A CFRP convertible top bow is used as a supplement and support for the CFRP roof in the M4 Coupe. 
This CFRP convertible top bow sits in the middle at the height of the B-pillar and has a hybrid design. 
In comparison to the standard version, another 1.5 kg could be saved with the use of this CFRP 
convertible top bow. 

The CFRP roof structure thus also contributes to the consistent lightweight construction concept 
of the new M3/M4 Coupe.

3.2.4. Trunk lid 

Trunk lid F80 M3 

The trunk lid of the F80 M3 is a standard part adopted from the F30. It is enhanced with a M-specific 
rear spoiler edge (Gurney). The rear diffuser and the Gurney increase the downforce at the rear axle, 
in particular at higher speeds. 

The Gurney is an aerodynamic component (named after the former Formula 1 driver) which functions 
as a tear-off edge. The Gurney enhances downforce at the rear axle and thus contributes to the 
optimization of the driving dynamics. 



F80 M3 Gurney 


Trunk lid of F82 M4 Coupe 

The trunk lid of the F82 M4 Coupe is a new design especially for the M4 Coupe, it was modelled after 
the BMW M3 CSL. It’s made from carbon and other fiber composites C-SMC, similar to previous 
vehicles (FI 2, FI 3, F06, E63 and E64). 

The shape of the trunk lid was enhanced for perfect aerodynamics so that no additional rear spoiler 
edge is necessary due to the integrated tear-off edge (Gurney). 

The exterior shell at the top and bottom is made from hollow glass spheres in the Low Density-Sheet 
Moulding Compound (LD-SMC) procedure. The mounting (including the threads) is made from sheet 
steel and cathodic dipped (E-coated) and then bonded to the interior shell. The interior shell is made 
from carbon fibers in the Carbon Fiber-Sheet Moulding Compound (C-SMC). 

The trunk lid of the M4 Coupe has its own M styling, adapted to the M4 Coupe rear fenders, and the 
contoured line of the CFRP roof is continued into the trunk lid. 

The trunk lid of the F82 is longer and higher in comparison to the F32, and is about 5 kg lighter.

3.2.5. Underbody and thermal protection 

Underbody 

The entire vehicle underbody is fully cladded and thus integrated into the aerodynamics concept of the 
M3/M4 Coupe, in order to reduce lift at the front and rear axle and distribute it evenly. This highlights 
and optimizes the driving dynamics concept, particularly at higher speeds. The underbody panels 
were adapted in terms of the cooling and flow around and through the drive components as well as 
chassis and suspension components, without compromising the aerodynamics concept. 

Thermal protection 

New heat insulation: 

• The heat insulation of the underbody panels is new. 

• The heat insulation of the fuel tank is new. 

• The heat insulation of the tunnel is new. 

• The heat insulation of the front and rear silencer is new. 

• A completely new heat insulation of the luggage compartment prevents it from heating 
up too much due to the hot exhaust air flow near the rear axle differential.

M leather steering wheel 

The M leather steering wheel with multifunction is built on a magnesium armature and is based on the 
steering wheel used with FI 0 M5. Above the thumb rests are the M gearshift paddle with M shifting 
logic (left downshift, right upshift). 

In comparison to the F3x M3, the inner diameter of the steering wheel was reduced by 8 mm and 
the outer diameter by 2 mm. The steering wheel rim was reinforced to 31.6 mm in comparison to the 
standard version and enhanced in terms of ergonomics from a round to an oval cross-section which 
improves the grip. 

The color M stitching is another difference to the F3x M3. The M leather steering wheel in the double¬ 
spoke design with a stainless steel center trim and with M inscription is black leather. Steering wheel 
heating and the lane change warning are available as optional equipment. 

Two MDrive buttons are integrated in the left multifunction field. For more details please see the 
chapter "M Drive menu".

4.2. Transmission 


4.2.1. Manual gearbox 

In the F80/F82 a manual gearbox is installed as standard equipment. It is an enhanced version of the 
familiar K-transmission, which is known from the production vehicles of BMW AG. The transmission 
was adapted to the higher power requirements of the M3/M4 Coupe.

rGT4-C 





F80/F82 Complete Vehicle 

4. Powertrain 


The following components were modified: 

• Weight reduction of about 12 kg in comparison to the previous transmission in the E9x M3. 

• Smaller in size which contributes to the lower weight. 

• Improved shifting comfort due to use of new type of carbon friction lining in the 
synchronization units. 

• Increased efficiency with dry sump lubrication ("splash" lubrication and targeted oil ducts are 
no longer used). This results in a reduction of heat development to the extent that external 
cooling (like in the E9x M3) is not necessary. 

• Reduction of noise level. 


Engine speed adaptation for a gear change (double clutch) 

The new F80/F82 engine uses speed adaptation for the manual gearbox (Similar to the production 
vehicles with the B-engines with manual gearboxes). The engine speed adaptation further highlights 
the sporting character of the new F80/F82 and its motor racing genes. 

In addition, the engine speed adaptation is used to reduce the drag torque and improve the driving 
stability in the dynamic handling characteristics at the limit range. 

The engine speed during a gear change is automatically adapted to the new transmission ratio. 

The engine and the transmission input shaft thus have the same speed when engaging the clutch. 
This ensures the clutch is always engaged smoothly. 

The corresponding engine speed is calculated by the DME and held for a maximum of two seconds. 
With M Driving Modes the engine speed is adapted at different rates depending on the driving mode. 
For the control the clutch pedal must be pressed fully when switching. 

The engine speed adaptation for the gear change is not active. 

The engine speed adaptation for a gear change can be deactivated via the diagnosis system. 


The engine speed adaptation includes the following components and functions: 

• New gear sensor via x-y axle, detects gearshift request and communicates 
directly with the engine control unit. 

• Clutch switch is two-stage and communicates directly with the DME. 

• Engine speed adaptation characteristic is based on the selected driving mode. 

• No reverse gear switch as detection via gear sensor. 

The function of the engine speed adaptation in the F80/F82 differs to the FI 0 M5 in the following 
point: 

• No engine speed recording via the synchronization unit. 

• The detection of the transmission input speed was done at a gear (constant gear) in the 
transmission. The determination of the transmission ratio had to be calculated from the 
wheel speed (counted back to transmission output speed) and transmission input speed.

The neutral sensor is capable of self-diagnosis and if necessary can input a fault in the fault memory. 
An additional display is not done. After the replacement of the gear sensor it must be re-calibrated with 
help of the BMW diagnosis system. 


4.2.2. Clutch 

A double-disc clutch is installed in combination with the manual gearbox. The operating principle of 
the clutch is identical to the double-disc clutch systems already used. 

4.2.3. M double-clutch transmission (M DCT) with Drivelogic 

The GS7D36BG M DCT with Drivelogic is available as optional equipment. 

The DCT in the new F80/F82 has the same technical features as the DCT in the FI 0 M5, FI 2 M6, 
F13M6, and F06 M6. 

The M Double-clutch Transmission with Drivelogic was used (for the first time) in the E93 M3 with the 
S65B40 engine with the designation GS7D36SG. This transmission is described in the M DCT web 
course and in the ST813 M DCT transmission training manual available in ICP and TIS.

The number of driving programs is the same as that in Fix M and F06 M6 vehicles. However the 
design of the Drivelogic button has changed. Instead of a rocker type button (as the E9x M3 and for 

Fix M vehicles), the F80/F82 uses a normal pressure switch for clicking through the programs. 


After each change between sequential mode and Drive mode the last selected driving program is 
active. 

After each engine start driving program 1 is active in Drive mode. 

Drive mode 

Three driving programs are available: 

1: Efficient drive 
2: Relaxed drive 
3: Sporty drive 


47 













F80/F82 Complete Vehicle 

4. Powertrain 


Sequential mode 

Three driving programs are also available here: 

1: Comfortable gear shifts. 

2: Sporty, fast gear shifts. 

3: Maximum shift speed and the requirement for the activation of the launch control. 

To use the highest, i.e. the third driving program, the DSC does not have to be activated. 

4.2.9. Launch Control 

Launch Control enables optimal acceleration when driving off on a smooth roadway. 

A 

During the first 5,000 km (3,100 miles) the launch control should generally not be used (see also the 
chapter on driving tips in the Owner's Manual). 

The 2,000 km (1,242 miles) pre-delivery check must have been completed and reset/confirmed with 
the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA) (do not reset via the instrument cluster service 
function, as otherwise the launch control is not enabled). 

Premature wear occurs as a result of the high load of the vehicle with use of the launch 
control. 


Launch mode preconditions 

Sequence 

Precondition/Action 

1 

The vehicle must be stationary, the engine running and at operating 
temperature (about 10 km (6 mile) warm-up journey). 

2 

The DSC is deactivated. 

3 

The sequential mode and the third Drivelogic driving program are selected. 

4 

The brake pedal is gently pressed with the left foot. 

5 

The accelerator pedal is pressed fully and held in this position. 

6 

In the M instrument cluster a flag symbol must appear (if not, check notes and 
steps 1-5). 

7 

An engine speed for pulling away of about 3500 rpm is set, which can be 
modified up or down in the cruise control settings by a maximum 500 rpm in 

100 rpm increments. 

8 

The left foot is taken off the brake within 3 seconds. 


48 










F80/F82 Complete Vehicle 

4. Powertrain 


Effect 


The Launch Control shifts up to 5th gear independently with the shortest possible shifting 
times and enhanced driving performance shift points as long as the driver has the accelerator 
pedal pressed in fully and a time limit of 22 seconds is not exceeded for the acceleration. 

The start flag in the instrument cluster remains active. 


Automatic deactivation 

• The driver releases (also if only temporary) the accelerator pedal full load position 
during acceleration or the acceleration phase reaches a duration of 22 seconds. 

If even one of these preconditions is not met, it is not possible to activate the Launch Control. 

Also at excessive transmission oil temperature (e.g. repeat Launch Control or race-like start), 
activation is not allowed and locked until an acceptable temperature threshold is reached. 

The start flag goes out with every deactivation and the automatic forced upshift is cancelled. 

4.2.10. Transmission control unit 

The M DCT control unit is installed in the mechatronics module in the transmission similar to the 
GS7D36SG. 

The software is adapted to the F80/F82. 

4.2.11. Emergency gearbox release 

A_ 

The emergency gearbox release is deleted similar to the F10, FI 2, FI 3 and F06. 

For towing away please observed the information in the Owner's Manual of the vehicle.

4.2.12. Service information 

Transmission oil circuit 

When work is required on the oil circuit of the DCT (regardless if it is the M DCT or AG DCT), for 
example after an accident, or if the oil circuit has to be opened due to a repair, there must be maximum 
cleanliness. This includes: 

• Thoroughly cleaning the outer oil circuit areas before disassembly of the components or 
opening the oil circuit. 

• All openings and lines must be closed immediately after disassembly with clean original plugs. 
Do not use unsealed components or replacement parts of the oil circuit without checking for 
cleanliness. 

• The workbay at which a M DCT is opened must be extremely clean and secured against dirt 
contamination, also during work interruptions. For example by covering with a clean and lint- 
free cover. 

Lifetime oil filling 

Similar to the E9x M3 and Fix M5/M6 with M DCT Drivelogic, no transmission oil change is currently 
planned at 2,000 km/1200 miles (pre-delivery check) or every third engine oil change. 

Repair/Part exchange 

Depending on the type of repair, the data status of the M DCT must be read out beforehand and read 
in again after the component has been replaced (e.g. replacement of mechatronics module). 

Depending on the type of repair (e.g. dual clutch change), the "Neutral" gear selection position must 
be selected before the engine is stopped.

The current information and specifications in the documents in the Integrated Service Technical 
Application (ISTA) must be observed in each case.

4.3. Driveshaft 

For the first time a one-piece carbon driveshaft is used in a BMW M vehicle. Traditionally steel or 
aluminum driveshafts are required for a vehicle designed for high performance. In order to be able 
to transmit the torque and engine speeds they are designed as a two-piece component and have 
a center mount. Only this design ensures high-speed performance, "critical bending speed". The 
tube element of the new M3/M4 Coupe carbon driveshaft enables a one-piece design due to its 
specific material properties. High rigidity was achieved with the tubular design of the driveshaft and 
the low density of the carbon material used in its fabrication. In addition, the legally mandated safety 
requirements were able to be integrated in the design. 

The significant weight saving along with excellent rigidity was able to be realized by using low material 
density of carbon and eliminating the center mount. 

In addition other desired requirements, such as corrosion resistance, low length compensation and 
enhanced comfort (oscillation acoustics) can be satisfied with the use of the carbon driveshaft. 

In comparison to the predecessor driveshaft in the E9x M3, the weight was able to be reduced by 5.3 
kg to 7.6 kg.

4.3.1. Service information 

• During disassembly ensure that the carbon driveshaft is removed first at the rear (at the sliding 
piece) and then at the front carrier (flexible disc). The installation should be done in the reverse 
sequence. 

• In the sliding piece there is a grease filling, which is coordinated precisely to requirements and 
is required for the function. Therefore, do not remove the grease cap before the driveshaft 

is pushed together for the installation at the sliding piece. Remove the grease cap after the 
pushing together and then screw the driveshaft at the rear axle differential. 

• Please check the U-type bellows again after pushing together. The U-type bellows should not 
arch outwards, bend back if necessary. 

A_ 

The carbon driveshaft is highly sensitive to impacts, therefore the driveshaft should not be stored in an 
upright position. The carbon driveshaft should be stored in a horizontal position or suspended. 

Also during this storage period keep the carbon driveshaft away from impacts. 

A clear indicator protective layer (woven fabric) is attached to the carbon driveshaft. If the carbon 
driveshaft was subjected to an impact, small cracks in the form of a spider web appear on this layer. 
Damage can be identified by means of this crack and the necessary measures deduced from a 
damage pattern catalog in the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA). 

The current information and specifications in the documents found in the Integrated Service Technical 
Application (ISTA) must be observed in each case.

4.4.1. Active M Differential 

This electronically/electromechanically controlled rear axle differential lock was developed especially 
for the F10 M5, it is used in the F06/F12/F13 M6 and now in the F80/F82. 


52 









F80/F82 Complete Vehicle 

4. Powertrain 


The M rear axle differential, size HAG 220 (ring gear 0 220 mm), is used with a M rear axle differential 
lock. The system designation for this is "regulated rear axle differential lock", the control unit 
designation is GHAS (Geregelte Hinter Achsgetriebe Sperre (regulated rear axle differential lock). 

This variable M differential lock II replaces the variable M differential lock I in the M rear axle differential 
HAG 215 (ring gear 0 215 mm) used in the E9x M3. 

The gear ratio of the HAG 220 is 3,154:1 (HAG 215: 3,615:1). 

This M rear axle differential can be recognized by an aluminum oil sump assembled from below and an 
electric motor which is visible from the outside. 

The HAG 220 is about 2.8 kg heavier than the HAG 215 at 49.7 kg. 



F80/F82 GFIAG, external view 


Demand-controlled lock 

The lock is a demand-controlled rear-axle differential lock which is active in the following situations: 

• Pulling away. 

• Differential speed at the rear axle for straight-ahead driving 
under tension due to various coefficients of friction, left/right. 

• Dynamic cornering tensioned. 

• Power oversteer (drifting). 

• Stabilization in coasting/overrun mode. 

Traction, handling and driving stability are enhanced by adjusting a defined differential speed or 
differential torque at the rear axle. 


The regulated M rear-axle differential lock works with a position-controlled electric motor and a ball 
ramp. The GHAS control unit is installed above the Rear Electronic Module (REM), at the rear right 
inner fender.

4.4.2. Structure/Function 

The lock-up torque is generated by a multi-disc clutch. The necessary axial pressure is applied to the 
multi-disc clutch by the position-controlled direct current motor by means of gears and a ball ramp 
mechanism. The clutch package operates between the differential housing (steel outer discs) and the 
right output (molybdenum-coated steel inner discs).

Differential housing (connected to outer discs) 


The electric motor (1) is bolted on to the housing and the pressure disc fixed to the second ball ramp 
half (5) in the housing. The mobile components of the ball ramp (2, 3 and 4) generate the necessary 
axial displacement of the pressure disc (5). These components are not subject to the differential 
transmission rotation and are disconnected from the rotating components by an axial needle bearing 
( 6 ). 

The components with the index 6 to 18 belong to the differential and rotate proportional to the rear 
axle gear speeds. 

The locking is done between the right output (16) and the differential housing (18) and counteracts a 
difference in speed between the output bevel gears (16 and 17). The disc spring (11) opens the lock 
when the engine is not supplied with current. 

4.4.3. System information 

The GHAS control unit evaluates the dynamic handling characteristics parameters made available by 
other control units via the FlexRay data bus and determines the lock-up torque to be applied. The DSC 
control unit can also request separate and higher-level locking interventions to stabilize the vehicle 
both when the DSC is activated and deactivated. 

The position-controlled direct current motor is activated directly by the power electronics of the GHAS 
control unit with vehicle voltage via a pulse-width-modulated signal. The frequency is 12.8 kHz and the 
maximum current level is 30 A. 

The electric motor is equipped with two hall effect sensors to determine its position and the direction 
of rotation.

Electric motor location determination 

To determine the position of the electric motor two hall effect sensors in the motor are evaluated. 

To determine the characteristic curve of the lock-up torque via the motor position a re-calibration is 
regularly performed to compensate for the wear in the clutch. 


59 











F80/F82 Complete Vehicle 

4. Powertrain 


In order to be able to assign a corresponding clutch lock-up torque to a certain position of the 
servomotor, and to take wear influences into consideration, every 1000 km (621 miles) or after 
an energy input in the lock of 100 kJ (corresponds to a lap of the Nurburgring) a reference run is 
performed after the engine is shut down. During this reference run the motor is subjected to a defined 
current level. The lock-up torque 1500 Nm (1106 Ib-ft) is assigned to the resulting position. 

Temperature monitoring 

Three temperature sensors are installed. The temperature of the control unit (driver output stage), 
the temperature of the electric motor and the transmission oil temperature are monitored. 

The temperature thresholds are as follows: 

Control unit 105 °C (221 °F) 

Electric motor 160 °C (320 °F) 

Oil temperature 190 °C (374 °F) 

The current oil specification is "BMW final drive oil synthetic MSP/A" (for e.g. Castrol SAF-XJ) and is 
the same oil used in the previous M vehicles with variable M differential lock. 

The capacity is currently 1.21(1.27 qrt). The current specification in our service information 
"Operating materials" and the technical data in the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA) 
must be observed in each case. 

A 

If, due to a fault, the GHAS lock function is switched off or fails, a locked differential is automatically 
reopened as the lock function is not self-locking. The driver is warned and informed regarding the 
effects that can be expected: 

1. Loss of traction with dynamic driving style and low coefficients of friction, particularly with different 
coefficients of friction, left/right. 

2. Possible deterioration of stability in dynamic driving situations. 


4.4.4. Service information 

• For a replacement of the GHAS control unit an encoding (activation of vehicle-related 
characteristic curve) and then an initial calibration are necessary and then the fault memory 
must be deleted. 

• After the replacement of the entire M rear axle differential a calibration must be performed and 
then the fault memory must be deleted. 

• For a replacement of the electric motor, electric motor plus intermediate gear or oil 
temperature sensor, only the fault memory must be deleted. 

The final drive oil is currently replaced every 2000 km/1200 miles (pre-delivery check) and at every 
third engine oil change.

4.4.5. Half-shafts 

As is typical for BMW M vehicles, the output shafts have a hollow design in order to make optimal use 
of the material in relation to material usage, weight and rigidity. 

These lightweight half-shafts are designed to transmit up to 7000 Nm (5163 Ib-ft) torque. 

The CV joints and the trunnion mounts of the F80/F82 are drilled hollow. This is the first time this 
intelligent lightweight construction was implemented in a M vehicle.

The wheel flange at the front axle and the rear axle have been enhanced in relation to their weight. 
The material has been reduced at places subject to little stress, and accumulated at heavily stressed

All components have been redesigned for the increased requirements. The guiding of the wheel for 
compression and steering is done via the wishbone, the tension strut, the spring strut and the track 
rod. 

In order to guarantee precise wheel guiding in transverse direction of vehicle, the power is transmitted 
from the swivel bearing to the front axle guide via the ball joints with no play. In order to also guarantee 
this in a longitudinal direction, the chassis and suspension forces are transmitted via specially 
developed elastomer bearings for the F80/F82 via the tension struts to the front axle support. 

The stiffening plate and the additional screw connections of the axle support and the side sills also 
ensure an increase in the transverse rigidity of the front of the vehicle by about 30%. 

The connection between the spring strut and the swivel bearing was realized by a clamp connection 
similar to the E82 M and E9x M3.

5. Chassis and Suspension 

A weight saving of about 5 kg was achieved with these measures in comparison to the F3x M3. 

Further weight savings were achieved with the design of the spring strut in aluminum, as well as the 
tubular design of the anti-roll bar (as in the E9x M3). 

The design of the front axle was done in close cooperation with the tires which were also specially 
developed for the F80/F82.

EfficientDynamics measures where also implemented on the new F80/F82. The rack-and-pinion 
steering has electrical steering wheel support "M Servotronic based on EPS". 

For power steering assistance is done via an electric motor located parallel to the steering rack 
housing. The power transmission is done via a ball screw design. 

The use of a M Servotronic (EPS) in the new M3/M4 Coupe results in a weight saving of about 3.5 kg 
in comparison to the hydraulic steering system in the E9x M3.

The M Servotronic (EPS) is an independent development for the M3/M4 Coupe. All components of 
the M Servotronic (EPS) have been developed specifically for the M3/M4 Coupe. The development of 
the steering was able to be coordinated to the typical M properties. Special attention was paid to the 
typical M features: 


Direct steering sensation 

Driving condition feedback 

Dynamic driving at the vehicle’s stability limit

The ratio of the M Servotronic (EPS) was also adapted to the M3/M4 Coupe. It should be highlighted 
that after an eighth of a revolution of the steering wheel the rack ratio increases by 8% (similar to the 
production vehicle F3x with the optional equipment SA 2VL Variable Sport Steering).

With the use of the M Servotronic (EPS) in the new M3/M4 Coupe the parking assistance system

5.1.2. Servotronic 

The Servotronic function known from traditional hydraulic steering systems is also used in the M 
Servotronic (EPS) and is installed in the M3/M4 Coupe as standard. It is a M Servotronic, which 
functions according to the same operating principle as in production vehicles. The difference in the 
M Servotronic is that three stages can be selected in comparison to two stages in the production 
vehicles, and it has a separate button in the driving dynamics button panel in the center console. 

The button or the configuration in the MDrive menu is used to switch between "Comfort", "Sport" and 
"Sport+". Here the corresponding characteristic curve is activated and in Sport direction the power 
steering support is also noticeably withdrawn. The program selection can also be pre-configured in the 
MDrive menu and selected via the M button on the steering wheel assigned to the MDrive.

5.1.3. Steering angle sensor 

The information on the steering angle is not recorded by the Electronic Power Steering (EPS) and not 
via a separate sensor on the steering wheel, instead its calculated based on the motor position angle 
of the EPS motor in relation to the steering wheel. 

The EPS transmits the position of the rack to the ICM control unit via FlexRay. During this process, 
the EPS calculates the absolute position of the rack based on the current motor position of the EPS 
motor and the number of complete revolutions performed by the motor starting from the zero position 
(straight-ahead driving position). 

Taking this position as the starting point, the ICM control unit determines the wheel-specific steering 
angle among other things using the stored ratio parameters (rack to wheel-specific steering angle) and 
transmits this via FlexRay. This wheel-specific steering angle is used by the DSC among other things 
as a reference variable for internal control functions. 

In cases where the absolute value is not available from the EPS (loss of Terminal 30, flash process), 
the absolute value is determined through interaction between the ICM and EPS using an adaptation 
function in which the steering wheel is turned from end stop to end stop (e.g. straight-ahead position - 
> left -> right -> straight-ahead position).

This design is characterized by maximum rigidity and minimal weight. The M rear axle support is fixed 
to the body without a bearing. This fixed connection (bolted) directly to the body ensures an optimized 
wheel guiding and thus enhanced directional stability. In addition, through the use of diagonal struts 
a direct transmission of the longitudinal forces applied during braking to the body structure was 
achieved.

Further weight savings compared to the F3x M3 was achieved with the design of the spring strut in 
aluminum, as well as the tubular design of the anti-roll bar like in the E9x M3. 

The design of the rear axle was done in close cooperation with the tires which were also specially 
developed for the F80/F82.

The M Carbon ceramic brakes are available as optional equipment from the series launch of the new 
F80/F82. In addition to the F10 M5, the FI 2 M6, FI 3 M6 and the F06 M6. 

The M Carbon ceramic brake system is also called C/SiC brake system. 

Depending on the situation, this offers a further increase in active safety compared to the 
M Compound brakes. In a direct comparison it also offers the following: 

• Even more direct/spontaneous use of brake force 

• Maximum heat resistance even with continuous sporty operation 

• Higher fading stability 

• Significantly reduced wear 

• 7 kg (15.4 lbs) weight reduction of rotating wheel masses 

• Increased suitability for winter driving conditions thanks to corrosion resistance. 



F80/F82 M Carbon ceramic brake, front axle 

As a visible distinguishing feature to the M Carbon ceramic brake system uses gold painted brake 
calipers with a color M logo. 

The F80/F82 Carbon ceramic brake system can only be used with the 19" M wheel rim due to the 
larger brake discs at the front. 

The brake discs are manufactured by Brembo SGL Carbon Ceramic Brakes GmbH.

Other combinations may have a negative effect on the performance and the drivability of the F80/F82 
and lead to forfeiture of the operating licence with forfeiture of the insurance coverage. 


5.4. Dynamic handling control systems 

The M-specific coordination of the driving dynamics (longitudinal, transverse and vertical) was done on 
the Nurburgring Nordschleife. The main criteria were handling and the lap times. 

5.4.1. Vertical Dynamics Management 

For vehicles with a M sports suspension (SA 2VF) the Electronic Damper Control (EDO) is installed. 
Here four continuously adjustable shock absorbers with coupled rebound/compression stage 
adjustment produce damping forces according to requirements. 

Through the use of forged aluminum dampers, the weight of the M sports suspension in the M3/ 

M4 Coupe was able to be reduced by about 5.5 kg when compared to the adaptive chassis and 
suspension in the F3x M3. Therefore the M sports suspension also contributes to the consistent 
lightweight construction concept of the new M3/M4 Coupe. 

The EDC function integrated in the M Vertical Dynamics Management control unit (M VDM) controls 
the adjustable dampers. 

The vehicle’s drivability can be influenced with regards to driving dynamics via the M sports 
suspension (EDC) button in the driving dynamics button panel at the center console. The program 
selection can also be pre-configured in the MDrive menu and selected via the corresponding M button 
on the steering wheel.

System function 

The Electronic Damper Control (EDC) is a variable, electronically controlled shock absorber 
adjustment system that controls the vertical dynamics of the vehicle. The front axle damper and rear 
axle damper can be controlled independent of each other. The EDC adapts the damping forces of the 
shock absorber more or less instantly to the changing road or driving conditions. 

The Electronic Damper Control (EDC) is installed with the optional equipment SA 2VF "M sports 
suspension". 

The EDC consists of: 

• four continuously adjustable shock absorbers with coupled rebound/compression stage 
adjustment 

• the VDM control unit 

• two wheel acceleration sensors on the front axle to determine the wheel movement 

• two wheel acceleration sensors on the rear axle to determine the wheel movement 

• a sensor cluster integrated into the ICM control unit which determines the body 
movements (pitch, vertical, roll). 


83 












F80/F82 Complete Vehicle 

5. Chassis and Suspension 

The sensors in the vehicle permanently measure: 

• the body and wheel acceleration 

• the current lateral and longitudinal acceleration 

• the vehicle speed 

• the steering wheel position 

Based on this measured data, the VDM control unit calculates the control commands to be sent to 
the electromagnetic valves in the shock absorbers for each individual wheel according to the road 
profile and driving situation. This means that the damping forces will always be applied according to 
the requirements. 

This improves ride comfort and also increases driving dynamics. 

This improves the vehicle's: 

• Suitability for long-distance journeys 

• Enhanced body stability and agility 

• Improves driving safety by minimizing wheel load 
fluctuations and reducing the stopping distance. 


M sports suspension (EDC) button option 

The button obtains its ground from the ICM and sends back a ground signal upon actuation to the 
ICM. The ICM forwards this information on the FlexRay data bus to the M VDM. 

In the F80/F82 Electronic Damper Control there are options "Comfort", "Sport" and "Sport+". 

All three programs have dynamic control in the F80/F82. 

Note: 

In the first E92/E90 M3 models the EDC had the three options, "Comfort", "Normal" and "Sport", 
whereby with the "Sport" option there is no dynamic control, but the dampers are set very hard. This 
is primarily suited for a cone slalom on an even surface. However, the fastest possible times on normal 
roads cannot be achieved with the "Sport" option. The E93 M3 was dynamically controlled from 
standard production in "Sport" mode, as well as in all subsequent models in the FI 0 M5, FI 2/FI 3 M6 
and the F06 M6 in "Sport+" mode. 

Program description 

• "Comfort" emphasizes the comfortable design in the F80/F82 in order to satisfy the comfort 
requirements of a M3/M4 Coupe customer. The damper hardness is set to comfortable. 

• "Sport" supports a dynamic and sporty driving style with increased damper hardness. 

• "Sport+" in the F80/F82 means that dynamic control now also takes place here, whereby the 
damper hardness is increased further in comparison to "Normal". It may therefore also be the 
best selection for the fastest times on different route profiles on very even surfaces, unlike a 
route profile similar to a "cone-lined slalom".

5.4.2. Transverse dynamics management 

Integrated Chassis Management 

The ICM is the transverse dynamics system network. This control unit coordinates the interaction 
between the M Servotronic (EPS), DSC, M sports suspension, engine control, M DCT and the 
regulated rear axle differential lock (GHAS). 

5.4.3. Longitudinal dynamics management 

The LDM is performed by the DSC. The DSC MK 100 from Continental is used in the F80/F82. 

M dynamic mode and DSC OFF mode 

In M dynamic mode (MDM) the control threshold of the brake interventions is expanded/raised and the 
engine power reduction by the ASC is applied significantly later. This enables driver-oriented dynamic 
and sporty drivability. 

The "DSC" driving dynamics button or the configuration in the MDrive menu is used to switch 
between "DSC ON", "MDM" and "DSC OFF". The button obtains its mass from the ICM and sends 
back a mass signal upon actuation to the ICM. The ICM forwards this information on the FlexRay data 
bus to the DSC.

6.1. Voltage supply 


6.1.1. Overview 

For the first time the voltage supply in a BMW M vehicle, an energy storage device other than the 
lead-acid battery is used. In the new F80/F82 a li-ion starter battery is installed for the series 
launch, which supplies the vehicle electrical system with voltage. Depending on the structure and/ 
or the material used for the electrodes, li-ion batteries are subdivided. In this case it is lithium-iron 
phosphate. The outer appearance of the li-ion starter battery does not differ from a normal starter 
battery, all components of the li-ion starter battery are located in the same housing. 

All other functions and components of the voltage supply are based on the F3x. Further information 
can be found in the Training Reference Manual ST1311 F30 Complete Vehicle. 



F80/F82 li-ion starter battery 


6.1.2. Advantages 

The following advantages come with the use of a li-ion starter battery, which were decisive for the use 
of this technology in a high-performance vehicle like the F80/F82: 

• Weight saving: 

Also here in the area of the starter battery the concept of the intelligent lightweight 
construction in the new F80/F82 was pursued. With the use of the li-ion starter battery the 
weight of the starter battery was able to be reduced by about 12.5 kg. The li-ion starter battery 
only weighs 14 kg in comparison to a conventional AGM 90 Ah battery with about 26.5 kg. 

• C0 2 saving: 

A C0 2 saving can be achieved with a higher automatic engine start/stop function (MSA) 
availability. With a conventional lead-acid battery the regeneration capacity is not as high as 
with a li-ion battery as a result of the intelligent generator control. The li-ion starter battery can 
absorb considerably higher currents in a shorter time for charging in comparison to the lead- 
acid battery. This makes it ideal for use in vehicles with intelligent generator control (IGR). 


86 


F80/F82 Complete Vehicle 

6. General Vehicle Electronics 


Life cycle: 

The number of available full cycles for li-ion battery is 14 times higher than for a conventional 
lead-acid battery. The li-ion battery is therefore the optimal alternative for use of the automatic 
engine start/stop function (MSA) in conjunction with the intelligent generator control (IGR). 
The battery life is also about twice as high as the traditional lead-acid battery. 

Maintenance-free: 

Maintenance-free, as no maintenance is required after topping up with distilled water 
(not with AGM batteries). 

Ideal voltage level: 

With the use of lithium iron phosphate cells (LiFePO^, which have a nominal voltage of 3.3 V 
per cell, a nominal voltage of the li-ion starter battery of 13.2 V could be achieved. 

Very high intrinsic safety: 

Lithium iron phosphate cells (LiFePO^ generally have an even lower hazard potential than 
other lithium-based batteries.

6.1.5. Function 

In addition to the four cells, there are also electronics and a battery isolating switch (2 relays) in the 
housing of the battery. 

Integrated electronics "Battery supervision circuits" 

The integrated electronics, the so-called battery supervision circuits (BUE), are responsible for the: 

• Communication via LIN data bus with FEM/DME 

• Diagnostics 

• Wake-up function via FEM via LIN data bus 

• Current monitoring of the individual cells and battery 

• Closed-circuit current monitoring 

• Voltage monitoring of the individual cells and battery 

• Cell voltage adaptation with counter function via passive system (resistance) 

• Startability monitoring 

• Temperature monitoring with resulting temperature model 

• Internal resistance monitoring 

• State of charge monitoring 

• Battery condition monitoring 

• Battery capacity monitoring 

• Data memory for battery information 

• Activation of the battery isolating switch in the event of a fault. 

The battery supervision circuits use the plug connection of the IBS. This is why there is no IBS 
installed in the F80/F82. All functions of the IBS are assumed in the F80/F82 by the battery 
supervision circuits. 

The battery supervision circuits cannot be replaced separately and are only offered together with the 
battery. 

Battery isolating switch 

The battery isolating switch (relay) is present twice, whereby it is a redundant system. This means in 
the event of failure of one switch (relay) the second battery isolating switch (relay) assumes the task. 

The battery isolating switch is activated by the battery supervision circuits and is responsible for 
protecting the li-ion cells from external and internal influences in the event of a fault. 

The following parameters may have effects on the position of the battery isolating switch: 

• Voltage 

• Current 

• Temperature

A_ 

If the voltage falls below 8 V and the battery isolating switch opens, this becomes noticeable by a 
vehicle electrical system without voltage. Electrical functions are therefore no longer available. In this 
case the battery should not be replaced straight away as an initial measure. It is generally sufficient to 
recharge the battery. As soon as the battery supervision circuits detect a voltage over 10 V for longer 
than 2 seconds, the battery supervision circuits close the battery isolating switch again. The vehicle 
electrical system is supplied with voltage again. All electrical functions are available again. The battery 
is then charged again. 

The battery only has to be replaced if the battery isolating switch no longer closes or the energy 
diagnosis specifies a replacement. 

Refer to SIB 04 06 14 for more information.

* The M DKG (M Double-clutch Transmission) is referred to as M DCT in the US market due to 
a marketing decision. 


The following deviations exist in comparison to the standard F3x: 

PT-CAN 

The S55B30T0 engine exclusively obtains the DME variant MEVD17.2.G. In place of the electronic 
transmission control (EGS) the M Double-Clutch Transmission Drivelogic (M DKG/M DCT) is used and 
instead of the gear selector switch (GWS) the M gear selector switch (GWS) with Drivelogic button is 
used. 

FlexRay 

The regulated rear axle differential lock (GHAS) is also new. 

K-CAN 

Active Sound Design (ASD) is new. The trailer module (AHM) is deleted. 

MOST 

There is no difference to the current F3x vehicle electrical system.

6.3. On-board information 

6.3.1. MDrive menu 

The MDrive menu can be found in the Settings menu. There are two individually adjustable M Drive 
configurations, M Drivel and M Drive2. 

The settings performed there are called up by pressing the corresponding button of the two available 
M buttons on the multifunction steering wheel.

F80/F82 Complete Vehicle 

6. General Vehicle Electronics 


There are two M buttons on the steering wheel thus enabling two different settings to be saved and 
called up. 

The activation of an MDrive configuration is displayed by an Ml or M2 symbol in the instrument 
cluster. The corresponding symbol flashes if for example ABS or DSC adjust upon activation of 
request. A renewed activation is only possible if the control is completed. 



F80/F82 MDrive combination display 


During the journey a requested configuration can be temporarily changed at any time until "Ignition 
OFF". The corresponding driving dynamics button must be operated. The Ml or M2 symbol in the 
instrument cluster goes out. 

An efficient/comfortable configuration is set by default in the factory for the Ml button and a sporty 
configuration for the M2 button. This setting can be adapted in the MDrive menu to the customer's 
needs and also reset again to the factory setting. Each M button is individually configurable and the 
overall configuration is also assigned to the vehicle remote control being used. 

If the DSC selection "MDM" or "DSC OFF" is chosen, a repeated, i.e. second operation, of the 
corresponding M button is required for activation of the configuration for approval reasons.

Configuration quick save 

A modified M setting or a new M setting using the drive dynamic buttons can be assigned to one 
of the two M buttons on the steering wheel Ml or M2. The corresponding M button on the steering 
wheel must be pressed and held for two seconds. The current configuration is set and overwrites 
any previously saved settings. This allows quick saving without accessing the M Drive menu. 

A_ 

If the driver is not aware that holding down the M button overwrites the current configuration/setting, 
this may lead to an unjustified customer complaint. 


Active configuration 

The individual driving stability controls can be set by the driver (while driving) using the assigned 
buttons. Then one of the two M buttons on the steering wheel can be pressed and held for 2 seconds 
to save the current configuration.

6.3.2. M instrument cluster 

The M instrument cluster is based on the instrument cluster high version from the F3x. The respective 
scales of the instrument cluster are market- and vehicle-specific. 

The following M-specific changes exist in comparison to the F3x: 

Round instruments: 

• Speed and engine speed display correspond to the drive concept 
(200 mph in 20 mph increments and 8,000 rpm). 

• Typical M red needle, lighting of the dial in white (also during 
the day without driving light), M inscription. 



F80/F82 instrument cluster 

M-specific displays: 


• MDM M dynamic mode symbol in place of the DTC 

• Ml = M Drivel 

• M2 = M Drive2 

• Display of gear 

• Display of Drivelogic (bar symbol such as a button) 

• Display of system status: engine dynamics, damper control and Servotronic 

In the instrument cluster the current configuration of the engine dynamics, damper control and 
Servotronic systems is shown in the bottom part of the rev counter field. This function can be activated 
under Settings in the Configuration menu display. 


104 




F80/F82 Complete Vehicle 

6. General Vehicle Electronics 


The confirmation of the MDrive settings for DSC, engine dynamics, transmission, EDC and 
Servotronic is also done centrally in the instrument cluster. 

For setting/adjustment work in the engine dynamics, EDC and Servotronic systems the response of 
the button activation is also done as a list in the instrument cluster. 

6.3.3. Head-Up Display 

The optional color head-up display, depending on the national-market version, can switch to the 
M-specific display. 

The following information/parameters can be shown: 

• Shift point indicator by Shift-light function 

• Engine speed over rev counter range 

• Transmission shift level 

• Vehicle speed 

• Speed limit information (optional equipment) 

• Warnings same as F3x 



F80/F82 Head-Up Display 

The M-specific display for corresponding configuration in the MDrive menu is activated via the 
M button on the steering wheel or by selecting it from the Head-Up configuration menu. 

6.3.4. Active Sound Design 

The Active Sound Design (ASD) is described in a separate Technical Reference Manual ST 1204 
Active Sound Design.
