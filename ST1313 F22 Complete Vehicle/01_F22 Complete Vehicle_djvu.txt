Introduction 



BMW of North America is pleased to announce the all NEW MY2014 BMW 2 Series 
Coupe. 

The 2 Series Coupe will start production in November 2013, with retail launch planned 
for early 2014. 

The BMW 2 Series Coupe builds on the brand's tradition of compact models offering 
an outstanding degree of driver engagement. The presences of the number "2" in the 
model designation creates a close link to this heritage. The introduction of the BMW 
2002 in 1968, for instance, opened up a whole new vehicle segment. Inspired most 
profoundly by its precisely tailored package of powertrain and chassis technology, the 
two-door Coupe became a global standard for sporty handling and intense driving 
pleasure in the sub-compact car segment. 

The 2 Series Coupe features many EfficientDynamics measures and technologies 
to reduce fuel consumption while enhancing driving performance, handling, and 
aerodynamics. 

Measures include: 

• Auto Start/Stop system 

• Optimized aerodynamics with Air Curtains in the front bumper 

• Electric Power Steering 

• Optimum Shift Indicator 

• Intelligent lightweight construction 

(132 lbs lighter than the E82 despite increased dimensions) 

• Brake Energy Regeneration 

• ECO PRO mode with intelligent energy and climate management

Exterior 


Sporting presence, muscular agility and assured elegance come together in the exterior 
design of the BMW 2 Series Coupe. The car’s more clearly distinguished design identity 
illustrates its progress in moving the game on from its predecessor. The BMW 2 Series 
Coupe embodies the Ultimate Driving Machine in more concentrated and intense form 
than ever before in the premium sub-compact segment. 



Dimensions 

Compared to the previous 1 Series Coupe, the 2 Series increased in every direction with 
one clear focus: taking dynamics to the next level. The 2 Series displays a significantly 
wider track (front +1.6" / rear +1.7"), increased wheel base (+1.3"), increased length 
(+2.8") and a sleeker roofline. Additional benefits of this new design are increased 
trunk volume (+0.7 cu.ft) and rear leg room (+0.8"). The curb weight was lowered by 
4% (-132 lbs) and the center of gravity is close to the 4 Series Coupe which is with the 
lowest in the BMW line-up. Lastly the F22 only 3mm taller than the 4 series coupe.

include: 

• Seat cushion forward/backward slide 

• Backrest angle (recline) 

• Seat height 

• Seat cushion angle 

• Head rest height (manual adjustment) 

• Head rest tilt (manual adjustment)

Lines 


To underline the very sportive character of the vehicle, the BMW 2 Series Coupe is avail¬ 
able with only one optional Line as well as M Sport to further enhance and personalize 
the design of the vehicle. 

Also, Sport Line and M Sport are only available on the 228i. Since there is an extraordi¬ 
nary level of standard equipment on the M235i, it does not require any further enhance¬ 
ments lines. 

The Sport Line further increases the visual dynamic impression of the car through use of 
black exterior design elements, and through striking contrasts on the inside. M Sport 
transforms the 2 Series Coupe into the perfect athlete with its aerodynamically optimized 
body kit and race inspired interior featuring typical enhancements such as an M steering 
wheel and sport seats. 

To help you visualize the differences, see the images below.

Performance and Dynamics 


Engines 

The BMW 2 Series Coupe is powered by two critically acclaimed Twin Power Turbo 
engines: a 2.0 liter, inline 4-cylinder engine (N20) and a 3.0 liter, inline 6-cylinder engine 
(N55). In keeping with BMW’s principled EfficientDynamics strategy, both engines offer 
enhanced performance while also substantially reducing fuel consumption and emis¬ 
sions. 

This is made possible by the use of some of the most advanced engine technologies, 
such as: 

• A twin-scroll single turbocharger 

• Valvetronic 

• Double VANOS 

• Direct-injection 

In case of the M235i the regular inline 6-cylinder TwinPower Turbo engine was even fur¬ 
ther enhance by BMW M Division. Specific enhancements in hardware (e.g. crankshaft) 
and software (e.g. dynamic mapping) contribute significantly to the outstanding perfor¬ 
mance of the M235i. 

Engine specifications: 

• N20 - 2.01 TwinPower Turbo 4-cylinder (240 hp / 255 Ib-ft) 228i 

• N26 - 2.01 TwinPower Turbo 4-cylinder (240 hp / 255 Ib-ft) 228i SULEV 

• N55 - 3.01 TwinPower Turbo 6-cylinder M Performance (320 hp / 330 Ib-ft) M235i

Transmissions 


All models come equipped with the Sport 8-speed STEPTRONIC automatic transmis¬ 
sion with paddle shifters. Its wider spread of ratios from lowest to highest gear enhances 
acceleration and response across the range of driving speeds while its “taller” cruising 
gears make a significant contribution to reduced fuel consumption and carbon dioxide 
emissions, as well as quietness. 

A 6-speed manual transmission is available on both models.

Chassis and Suspensions 

Precision chassis engineering has long been a hallmark of BMW design, and the 2 Series 
will set new standards in its segment for ride comfort coupled with unparalleled direction¬ 
al stability and dynamic handling. The car is based on the platform of the latest 3 Series 
Sedan, but our engineers went the extra length to ensure the 2 Series Coupe offers the 
driving experience that's expected of a BMW Coupe. 

The 2 Series Coupe also has a longer wheelbase, wider tracks and lower ride height than 
the 1 Series Coupe it replaces. This allows the driver to fully exploit the dynamic potential 
of the new Coupe, to which a low center of gravity, a much wider track compared to its 
predecessor and ideal 50:50 weight distribution make key contributions. 

Additionally, the 228i can be equipped with two optional suspension systems: 

• M Sport suspension, with Sport Line or M Sport 

• Adaptive M Suspension, part of the Dynamic Handling Package (ZDH) 

Both optional suspension systems do lower the ride height of the 2 Series Coupe 
by 10 millimeters. The M235i is already equipped with this features in its standard 
configuration.

Steering 

The 2 Series Coupe utilizes Electric Power Steering (EPS). This system uses an electric 
motor that is activated only when necessary. The consumption of energy is therefore 
reduced to zero when driving in a straight line or when maintaining a steady steering 
angle. 

Also standard on the 2 Series is BMW’s Servotronic variable assist steering system. 

It modulates the effort required to turn the steering wheel based on vehicle speed. Less 
effort is required at lower speeds to facilitate tight maneuvers (parking, U-turns,etc.) while 
the steering effort increases at higher speeds for more road feel and safety. 

The 228i 2 Series Coupe can also receive an additional Variable Sport Steering system 
which reduces the steering wheel turns from lock to lock by 25%. This benefits comfort 
as it facilitates maneuvers in tight spots such as parking, yet it also contributes to greater 
sportiness as it requires less steering angle in evasive maneuvers. 

This feature is standard on the M235i. 

Brakes 


The 2 Series Coupe comes with two distinct braking systems: 

The 228i models feature lightweight sliding calipers with large 
vented discs and Anti-Lock Braking capabilities at all four wheels. 

The M235i Coupe features the M Sport brakes which feature: 

• 4-piston fixed calipers front / 2-piston calipers rear 

• Lightweight brake discs 

• High-performance brake pads 

• Blue-painted calipers with "M" designation
