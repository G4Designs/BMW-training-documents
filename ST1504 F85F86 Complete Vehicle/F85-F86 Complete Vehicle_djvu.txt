F85/F86 Complete Vehicle 

1. Introduction 


The BMW M family is being enhanced with the addition of the F85 (BMW X5 M) and F86 (BMW X6 M) 
vehicle types. The F85 and F86 replace the successful E70 M and E71 M vehicles and also continue 
the typical M driving experience in the Sports Activity Vehicle/Sports Activity Coupe segment. As is 
already the case with the E70 M and E71 M, the F85 and F86 are equipped with the M TwinPower 
turbo engine, M Sport automatic transmission, xDrive, Dynamic Performance Control, Dynamic Drive, 
Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM) and M Servotronic. 

The new BMW X5 M/BMW X6 M will be launched onto the market in the first quarter of 2015. 


1.1. M history 

In 1972 the then BMW Motorsport started out with the legendary Ml. For over 40 years today's BMW 
M GmbH has been developing BMW M vehicles with a motorsport pedigree based on the standard 
production models. 

The typical M driving experience was also made to come alive for the first time in the Sports Activity 
Vehicle/Sports Activity Coupe segment in July 2009. The E70 M and E71 M were the first M vehicles 
with M TwinPower turbo engine, M Sport automatic transmission, xDrive, Dynamic Performance 
Control, Dynamic Drive and run-flat tires.

3.1. Exterior trim 

3.1.1. Front 

Bumper, front 

The single-piece M-specific bumper panel is extensively identical in design for the F85 and F86 and 
has M-specific flaps for reducing lift on the front axle. It is, including the standard ultrasonic sensors for 
Park Distance Control (PDC) and the number plate baseplate, painted to match the exterior body color. 
LED technology fog lights are fitted as standard. The grilles have a black grained finish. 

The optional Surround View camera and the ultrasonic sensor for the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant 
(PMA) is integrated similarly to the FI 5/FI 6 production vehicle at side front. 

Unlike the FI 5/FI 6, on the F85/F86 there is no air curtain integrated in the front bumper panel and 
the adjoining wheel arch panel. The air breather contributes, together with the gill, the underbody 
panelling, a rear spoiler on the F86 and the exterior mirrors, to the aerodynamic concept of the 
F85/F86. 

The F85/F86 is equipped as standard with Xenon headlights and LED fog lights. 



F85/F86 front view 


Radiator (kidney) grille 

The frame and the double-rib kidney bars of the BMW M radiator grille have black high-gloss struts as 
standard for the F85/F86. 

Cooling air routing 

The new air duct is identical for the F85 and F86. New cooling air routing for all radiators/coolers: 
multifunction air routing, air duct for brakes, air duct for auxiliary radiator and air duct with additional 
air guide for the additional low-temperature cooler. 

The air inlet areas for the required cooling air on the front bumper panel have been enlarged and 
optimized in such a way that the F85/F86 has 50 % more inlet area for cooling air than the E7x M. 

This measure has positive influence on the cooling power for charge air cooling, A/C condenser 
cooling, engine cooling, engine oil cooling, transmission cooling and oil cooling of the ARS system.

3.1.2. Side 

Fenders 

While sharing the same basic design, the front fenders on the F85 and F86 differ from each other 
geometrically. Distinctive design features include the so-called M gills and the X5 M/X6 M model 
inscriptions on the front left and right fenders. In addition, for the first time in a BMW X M vehicle the 
air breathers are used on the left and right in the fenders, which are integrated in the typical M gill. 



F85/F86 M gill elements with integrated air breather 


Exterior mirrors 

The exterior mirrors have an M-specific design with a double-rib character. They are heated and 
electrochromic as standard, and have a memory and fold-in function as well as an automatic parking 
function for the passenger side mirror. The turn indicators are integrated in the exterior mirror caps. 

Wheel arch trims/rims 

The painted front and rear wheel arch trims on the F85 and F86 have the same design as the wheel 
arch trims on the FI 5/FI 6 with M Sport package. 

Side sills 

The M side sills on the F85 and F86 have the same design as the FI 5/FI 6 side sill with 
M Sport package. 

Trim strips 

All the trim strips, with the exception of the roof trim strips, come in BMW Individual high-gloss 
Shadow Line. 

Roof trim strips 

The roof trim strips on the F85 come in matt black while those on the F86 are painted in the body 
color.

The M-specific bumper panel is designed in four pieces. The panel of the upper bumper with PDC is 
painted to match the body exterior color. The upper bumper panel is separated from the diffuser by 
a black grained finished rear trim. The lower diffuser is painted to match the body exterior color apart 
from the black grained finish center grille. 

The F86 also features a rear spoiler on the tailgate which improves the aerodynamics and accentuates 
the vehicle's sporty appearance.

3.1.4. Underbody and thermal protection 

Underbody 

The stiffening plate has been adopted from the FI 5/FI 6 with N63B4401 engine. The engine 
compartment shielding is a new part with an integrated air outlet for the additional upstream low- 
temperature charge air cooler and the additional transmission oil cooler. Only the F85/F86 have this 
part. 

In order to achieve an additional optimization in terms of reducing the lift on the F85/F86, M-specific 
air guides in front of the front wheels that differ geometrically from the FI 5/FI 6 have been developed 
in a wind tunnel. 

The center underbody panelling is omitted. In its place an aluminium air deflector is fitted that ensures 
an optimum flow to the distinct cooling fins on the aluminium transmission oil sump (BMW AG basis: 
plastic oil sump). 

Particular attention has been given to the air flow around the rear axle QMVH differential (final drive 
unit). 

The exhaust air ducting for the engine compartment and the transfer box have also been optimized. 

Thermal protection 

• The heat insulation for the rear silencer is a new part and identical for the F85 and F86. 

• Additional heat insulation for the fuel tank and the universal joint on the drive shaft at the front.

M driving area 



F85/F86 M driving area 


The upper instrument panel is leather-covered as standard. With the “Full leather” optional extra the 
lower instrument panel including all the flaps are also leather-covered. Merino fine graining leather with 
contrast stitching is used. The leather-covered center console in the F85/F86 has been adopted from 
the FI 6 including the knee pads. 


M leather steering wheel 

The M leather steering wheel with multifunction is built on a magnesium skeleton and is based on the 
steering wheel used with FI 0 M5. Above the thumb rests are the M gearshift paddles with M gearshift 
logic: downshift on left, upshift on right. 

The steering wheel has increased in its outer diameter to 380 mm compared with the FI 5/FI 6. The 
steering wheel rim is reinforced and ergonomically optimized from a round to an oval cross-section, 
improving the driver's grip (similarly to FI 5/FI 6 with Sport package). 

Gearshift paddles on the left for downshift and right “+” for upshift for the M automatic 
transmission are similar to Fix M5/M6, F06/M6 and F80/F82/F83 with double-clutch transmissions. 

The colored M stitching constitutes another difference from the production FI 5/FI 6 steering wheels. 
The M leather steering wheel in the double-spoke design with a stainless steel center trim and with M 
inscription is black leather. 


The vibration element for lane departure warning and lane change warning is integrated for the first 
time in an X5 M and an X6 M in the steering wheel.

4.1.2. Intake manifold 



Air intake system 

The air intake system is in principle comparable with that of the N63B4401 engine. The most 
important change to the air intake system is the adaptation of the intake manifold air duct with 
regard to the installation space in the F85/F86 (see Section 3.1.1 Front). 

The S63B44T2 engine is fitted on each cylinder bank with a hot film air mass meter, as has been in 
use since the N20 engine. The air temperature and intake pipe pressure sensors before and after the 
throttle valve are identical to those in the N63B4401 engine. 

Intake silencer 

The housing of the intake silencer in the F85/F86 corresponds in its geometry to that of the FI 5/FI 6 
with N63B4401 engine. The only differences are in the lettering due to M-specific markings. 

The air filter element differs in the quality of the filter mat from the N63B4401 engine and the 
S63B44T0 engine. This modification to the filter mat design has resulted in a 14 % lower loss of 
pressure through the air filter element compared with the predecessor S63B44O0 engine. The air 
filter element for the S63B44T2 engine must therefore be identified by means of the Electronic Parts 
Catalogue (EPC) in order to avoid incorrect installation. 

One air filter element is fitted per cylinder bank along similar lines to the N63B4401 engine.

4.1.3. Oil supply 

Differences in the oil supply between S63B44T0 engine and N63B4401 engine and 
S63B44T2 engine: 

• Oil sump adapted to use in xDrive vehicles as FI 5/FI 6 with xDrive. 

• Oil supply adapted to use on racetracks. 

• Oil-level check adopted from the N63B4401 by oil-level sensor instead of oil condition sensor. 

• Oil pump adopted from the N63B4401. 

Oil supply adaptations 

The position and length of the oil pump intake snorkel has been adapted to the geometric shape of the 
oil pump. This was necessary in order to adapt the oil supply to racetrack use. This ensures a secure 
oil supply, even when the oil level is displaced during lateral and longitudinal accelerations, as can 
occur during racing applications.

4.1.4. Crankshaft drive 

The crankshaft drive of the S63B44T2 engine has been adopted entirely from the S63B44T0 engine. 

4.1.5. Crankcase, cylinder head and timing drive 

The cylinder head of the S63B44T2 engine has been adopted entirely from the N63B4401 engine. 

4.1.6. Exhaust turbochargers 

As already featured in the S63B44T0 engine, two twin-scroll technology exhaust turbochargers 
are used. 

The exhaust turbochargers are supplied with exhaust gas as in the S63B44T0 engine via two 
cross-bank four-into-two exhaust manifolds, which is required for the special functioning of the 
twin-scroll exhaust turbochargers. 

The wastegate valves have been modified when compared with the twin-scroll turbocharger unit in 
the S63B44T0 engine. The wastegate valves can now be opened further in terms of their opening 
angle. This was necessary in order to comply with the requirements of the ULEVII exhaust emission 
standards. The wastegate valves are opened fully in the warm-up phase. In this way, a large proportion 
of the hot exhaust gases is diverted past the turbocharger turbines and routed directly to the catalytic 
converter. Thanks to this further opening of the wastegate valves, even more hot exhaust gas can now 
be specifically diverted in the warm-up phase to the catalytic converters. This system reduces the 
necessary warm-up phase of the catalytic converters and complies with the even stricter emission 
requirements. 

One-piece wastegate valves are used, increasing robustness. 

4.1.7. Catalytic converter 

The S63B44T2 engine has one catalytic converter per cylinder bank, each with two ceramic 
monoliths. The design of the catalytic converters corresponds to those in the N63B4401 engine. 

Oxygen sensors 

The established Bosch oxygen sensors are used: 

• Control sensor: LSU ADV 

• Monitoring sensor: LSF 4.2 

The control sensor is located ahead of the primary catalytic converter, as close as possible to the 
turbine outlet. Its position has been chosen so that all the cylinders can be recorded separately. 

The monitoring sensor is positioned between the first and second ceramic monoliths.

4.1.8. Exhaust system 

Differences in the exhaust system between S63B44T0 engine and N63B4401 engine and 
S63B44T2 engine: 

• Pneumatic exhaust flaps replaced by electrical exhaust flaps. 

• Exhaust gas routing system adapted to F85/F86. 

• M-specific, startup sound on engine starting. 

• Sporty exhaust sound to the vehicle occupants.

The exhaust sound of the F85/F86 is geared towards the E7x M, but is much more pronounced. 

The exhaust flaps are closed when the vehicle is stationary, in the lower engine revs range through 
all the vehicle speed ranges and when engine dynamics control is set to “Efficient”. 

In the upper engine revs range they open in response to the load requirement. 

When engine dynamics control is set to “Sport” and “Sport+” the exhaust flaps are stationary and 
fully open in the lower gears. 

In the upper gears the exhaust flaps are closed in the critical ranges, likewise in the upper engine revs 
ranges in response to the load requirement.

4.1.9. Vacuum supply 

The vacuum system of the S63B44T2 engine exhibits some changes from the S63B44T0 engine. 

The vacuum reservoir has a new installation location and the vacuum lines are adapted accordingly. 
The vacuum reservoir is now situated above the second cylinder bank underneath the engine cover 
and serves to supply the pneumatic wastegate valve actuators. 

4.1.10. Fuel preparation 

The fuel preparation components of the S63B44T2 engine have been adopted, except for the 
solenoid valve injectors, entirely from the S63B44T0 and N63B4401 engines. 

A new component is the fuel low-pressure sensor, which measures and monitors the fuel pressure on 
the low-pressure side. The fuel low-pressure sensor is connected to and monitored by the DME 2. 

For further information on the fuel preparation system of the S63B44T0 engine, please refer to the 
Technical Training Manual “S63 Top Engine” and “N63TU Engine”. 

The high-pressure fuel injection valves have been adapted to the requirements of exhaust emission 
standards. Solenoid valve injectors that support the software function of so-called “Controlled Valve 
Operation” (CVO) are used. 

For further information on “Controlled Valve Operation” (CVO), please refer to the Technical Training 
Manual “S55 Engine”. 

A_ 

Work on the fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. The coolant temperature 
must not exceed 40 °C /104° F. This stipulation must be observed without fail, as otherwise there is a 
risk of fuel being sprayed back on account of the residual pressure in the high-pressure fuel system. 

When working on the high-pressure fuel system, it is essential to adhere to conditions of absolute 
cleanliness and to observe the work sequences described in the repair instructions. Even the slightest 
contamination and damage to the screwed fittings of the high-pressure lines can cause leaks. 

When working on the fuel system of the S63B44T2 engine, it is important to ensure that the ignition 
coils are not fouled with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by sustained 
contact with fuel. This may result in flashovers on the spark plug head and thus in misfires. 

• Before making any modifications to the fuel system, remove the ignition coils and protect 
the spark plug shaft against ingress of fuel by covering with a cloth. 

• Before reinstalling the solenoid valve injectors, remove the ignition coils and ensure that 
conditions of greatest possible cleanliness are maintained. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced. 


24 



F85/F86 Complete Vehicle 

4. Engine/Powertrain 

• The CVO function comprises the system components "Injector" and "Digital Engine 
Electronics" (DME). These components therefore have to be identified with the vehicle 
identification number in the EPC in the event of a replacement. 

• For injectors and a DME which supports the CVO function, the injection quantity 
compensation during the replacement of one of the components is omitted. 

• The information and repair instructions in the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA) 
must be observed. 


4.1.11. Cooling (engine, engine oil, charge air, ARS (Dynamic Drive)) 

The cooling system also exhibits similarities to the S63B44T0 and N63B4401 engines. 

The engine and charge air cooling both have separate cooling circuits. 

Differences in cooling between the S63B44T0 and S63B44T2 engines: 

• Omission of cooling for the engine control units for bank 1 and bank 2. 

• Adaptation of the installation position of the additional coolant cooler for charge air 
cooling to F85/F86. 

• Electric coolant pumps for the charge air low-temperature circuit are independent 
for the S63B44T2 cylinder bank. 

• Adaptation of the installation position of the engine oil cooler to F85/F86. 

• Adaptation of the installation position for ARS transmission oil cooler to F85/F86. 

• Adaptation of the installation position of the radiator to F85/F86. 

• Engine coolant hoses optimized by larger cross-sections with regard to coolant flow. 

• Charge air coolant hoses optimized by larger cross-sections with regard to coolant flow. 

• Connections on the charge air cooler optimized with regard to coolant flow.

The engine cooling system is an independent coolant circuit, the so-called “high-temperature 
circuit”. It comprises the conventional engine cooling and cooling of the turbochargers. Even the 
vehicle interior heating is supplied by the coolant circuit of the engine cooling system.

The conventional coolant pump is driven via a belt and cannot be used for cooling the exhaust 
turbocharger after the engine has shut down. For this reason there is an electric coolant pump, which 
works at a power of 20 W, for this separate coolant circuit. But also during engine operation the 
electric coolant pump is switched on taking into account the following factors: 

• Coolant temperature at the engine outlet 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected fuel quantity 

Using these values the heat input into the engine is calculated. The after-run of the electric coolant 
pump can last up to 30 minutes. To improve the cooling effect, the electric fan is activated and can run 
down for up to a max. of 11 minutes.

Charge air cooling 

The system again makes use of so-called “indirect” charge air cooling, which is cooled by a separate 
coolant circuit, the so-called “low-temperature circuit”. 

To guarantee sufficient cooling of the charge air, in the S63B44T2 engine the low-temperature 
coolant-to-air heat exchangers are adapted when compared with the S63B44T0 engine. Because 
a larger surface area is available to the F85/F86 for the radiators at the front of the vehicle, two 
low temperature charge air coolers are used. One low-temperature charge air cooler is located 
directly after the front of the vehicle as the first component of the radiator assembly. A second low- 
temperature charge air cooler is located upstream of the radiator assembly. These are supplied with 
coolant via an independent cooling system with two electric coolant pumps.

The S63B44T2 engine again uses two electric auxiliary coolant pumps, as on the S63B44T0 engine, 
for the charge air cooling low-temperature circuit. But unlike on the S63B44T0 engine, which had for 
each cylinder bank an additional auxiliary low-temperature charge air coolant radiator and thus also an 
additional electric coolant pump for the charge air low-temperature circuit in each case, the S63B44T2 
engine utilizes a pump for the feed and a pump for the return. The indirect charge air coolers are 
connected in series to the respective circuit. 

Both 50 W pumps have self-diagnosis and dry-running protection, which can lead to fault code entries 
in the DME. If the engine speed is increased by 15 minutes over a period, the auxiliary water pumps are 
switched off and a fault code is stored in the DME. The expansion tank does not have a coolant level 
switch and does not automatically detect when the fluid level is too low. 

A 

If the electric coolant pump is removed and then to be reused, it is important to ensure that it is set 
down still filled with coolant. Drying out may cause the bearings to stick. The upshot of this is that the 
electric coolant pump may possibly not start, which in turn may result in engine damage. 

Before installing, turn the pump impeller manually to ensure that it moves freely.

Charge air cooler 

The charge air coolers have, in contrast to the S63B44T0 engine, been adapted to the installation 
space of the F85/F86. The charge air coolers have been reduced in size (dimensions), but still deliver 
the same performance data as those of the S63B44T0 engine. 

• Charge air cooler temperature input: approx. 160° C / 320° F 

• Charge air cooler temperature output: approx. < 50° C /122° F 

• Charging pressure: 2.5 bar 

• Pressure loss through charge air cooler: < 50 mbar 

This has been made possible with optimized charge air and coolant routing, which positively 
influences the pressure loss and the charge air cooling in the charge air cooler. The charge air coolers 
have been altered in terms of their geometry in such a way that they can be directly connected at the 
top to the turbocharger compressor wheel. The connections have been optimized downwards in such 
a way as to facilitate a direct connection to the electronic throttle valves via a connection hose. This 
has made it possible to adopt the intake neck with the electronic throttle valves from the N63B4401 
engine. The system supplier of the new charge air coolers is Delphi.

Cooling power limits 

If under extreme conditions such as for example in countries with high outside temperatures and 
the cooling power reaches its limits on the racetrack under race conditions, the cooling power of the 
vehicle air conditioning is reduced as the very first measure. Reducing the cooling power for the air 
conditioning ensures that there is sufficient cooling power available for the engine cooling and charge 
air cooling. The driver is alerted by a Check Control message if the cooling power of the engine cooling 
or charge air cooling reaches its limits. In the event of a customer complaint relating to the cooling 
power of the vehicle's air conditioning system, it is essential first to take these boundary conditions 
into consideration before starting troubleshooting on the cooling system and on the air conditioning.

4.1.12. Engine electrical system 

The MEVD 17.2.H from Bosch is used as the engine control unit in the S63B44T2 engine. The MEVD 
17.2.H is closely related to the MEVD 17.2.8 as used in the N63B4401. However the MEVD 17.2.H 
supports the software function “Controlled Valve Operation” (CVO) and also facilitates the use of the 
electrical exhaust flap actuator (EAKS). 

The F85/F86 use a MEVD 17.2.H engine control unit for each cylinder bank. 

The two engine control units are identically housed in the F85/F86 in terms of installation position, 
but are not water-cooled as in the FI 5/FI 6 with the MEVD 17.2.8.

4.1.13. Service information 

Engine oil filling 

Similarly to other BMW M vehicles with S engines, an engine oil change is scheduled at 2000 km / 
1200 miles (pre-delivery check) on the F85/F86 with the S63B44T2 engine.

4.2.1. M automatic transmission 

The F85/F86 uses a M automatic transmission with Drivelogic with the designation GM8HP75Z. 

It is called M8HP75 in the following. 

With the M Sport automatic transmission M8HP75, which is based on the 8HPTU of BMW AG, the 
customer is able to enjoy significantly more spontaneous gearshifts and further optimized control of 
the converter lockup clutch. 

This has been made possible by the further development of converter technology to effectively damp 
rotational irregularities in the drivetrain with a turbine torsional vibration damper. In this way it has 
been possible to reduce even further the operating ranges in which the converter lockup clutch has to 
be controlled with the result that the converter lockup clutch is closed in the vast majority of driving 
situations. This provides for an even more direct connection of the M8HP75 transmission to the 
complete drivetrain, resulting in an even sportier driving experience and reduced fuel consumption. 

The power transmission capability of the torque converter has been adapted to the increased torque 
of the S63B44T2 engine. 

In the F85/F86 the “Idle coasting” feature known from the non Motorsport vehicles is not used. 
However, the M8HP75 supports, the “ConnectedShift” function which is used in the BMW AG 
vehicles.

Transmission oil cooling 

The plastic transmission oil sump has been replaced by an aluminium version with larger cooling fins 
and the opening point of the transmission oil thermostats has been lowered, improving the cooling of 
the M8HP75 transmission. 

An additional transmission oil cooler with thermostat is used as well as the standard oil-to-water heat 
exchanger with thermostat to cool the M8HP75 in F85/F86. This additional transmission oil cooler, 
which is designed as a plate heat exchanger, operates according to the oil-to-air heat exchanger 
principle and is installed horizontally in front of the radiator assembly.

The cross-sections of the outer lines and hoses carrying transmission oil to the additional 
transmission oil cooler (oil-to-air heat exchanger principle) and transmission oil cooler have been 
optimized. This results in a greater oil flow rate, translating into more efficient cooling of the 
M automatic transmission. 

The thermostat of the transmission oil cooler (oil-to-water heat exchanger) opens at 86° C /186° F 
and that of the additional transmission oil cooler (oil-to-air heat exchanger principle) at 92° C /197° F. 
Both transmission oil coolers are fully open at 104° C / 219° F.

Gear selector lever 

The M automatic transmission is operated using the M gear selector lever (M GWS) or the gearshift 
paddles on the steering wheel. 

The BMW X5 M and BMW X6 M does not use a gear selector lever as seen in a BMW automatic 
transmission; instead, it uses the gear selector lever of the M double-clutch transmission as seen in 
BMW M vehicles. This means that the M gear selector levers have a uniform appearance, regardless 
of whether the BMW M vehicle in question is equipped with an M double-clutch transmission or an M 
automatic transmission. 



M GWS/M gear selector lever 


A button for engaging the parking lock as featured on the gear selector lever of the automatic 
transmission is omitted. The parking lock is automatically engaged as in the M double-clutch 
transmission. The transmission stage “Park P” is selected as in the logic familiar from M 
double-clutch transmissions. 

It is possible to choose and change between an automatic “D mode” and a sequential “S mode”. 
In each mode there are three driving programs, which can be selected and activated with the 

“Drivelogic switch”. 


46 


F85/F86 Complete Vehicle 

4. Engine/Powertrain 

Drivelogic 

The number of driving programs is the same as in Fix M, F80, F82, F83 and F06 M6 vehicles. 

The haptics of the Drivelogic switch have been altered, as already seen in the F80, F82, F83. A rocker 
was installed for the E9x M3 and for Fix M vehicles, while in the new F85/F86 a normal pressure 
switch is used for clicking through. 

After each change between Sequential mode and Drive mode the last selected driving 
program is active. 

After each engine start driving program 1 is active in Drive mode. 

D mode/Drive mode 

Automated mode, all the forward gears are automatically shifted. Kickdown is triggered by depressing 
the accelerator pedal beyond the pressure point. 

Three driving programs are available for selection: 

1: Efficient drive 

2: Relaxed drive 

3: Sporty drive 

S mode/Sequential mode 

The gears can be manually shifted by means of gearshift paddles on the steering wheel “+ or or the 
gear selector lever “forward and back” at the matching driving speed and engine revs. The selected 
gear is maintained even when the engine speed limitation is reached, but an automatic downshift is 
performed when the vehicle drops below the gear-specific minimum driving speed. 

When the S mode is selected for the first time after terminal change (engine restart), the last Drivelogic 
stage used is active. 

Three driving programs are also available here for selection: 

1: Comfortable, smooth gearshifts in all driving conditions. 

2: Sporty, fast gearshifts, light gearshift jolts permitted at higher load and engine revs. 

3: Maximum sporty shift speed and gearshifts are the requirement for the activation of Launch Control. 
To use the highest, i.e. the third driving program, the DSC does not have to be activated. 

M automatic transmission behavior when creeping 

The “Creep on request” function familiar from M double-clutch transmissions is effected for the first 
time in conjunction with a torque converter transmission. 

• When the service brake or parking brake is released with a drive position selected, 
there is no “Creeping” in the M automatic transmission (rolling possible). 

• “Creep on request” can be triggered by briefly depressing the accelerator pedal. 

This request is cancelled again only after the vehicle has come to a standstill again. 

• The Automatic Hold functions are maintained as on the FI 5/FI 6.

Launch Control 


Function: Launch Control enables optimal acceleration when driving off on a dry roadway. 


Sequence 

Precondition/Action 

1 . 

The vehicle must be stationary, the engine running and at operating 
temperature (approx. 10 km / 6 mile warm-up journey). 

2. 

Dynamic Stability Control is deactivated or M Dynamic Mode is activated. 

3. 

The Sequential mode and the third Drivelogic driving program are selected. 

4. 

The brake pedal is gently pressed with the left foot and held. 

5. 

The accelerator pedal is depressed fully and held in this position. 

6. 

In the M instrument cluster a flag symbol must appear (if not, check notes and 
steps 1-5). 

7. 

An optimum engine speed for pulling away is adjusted. 

8. 

The left foot is taken off the brake within 5 seconds. 



F85/F86 Launch Control active 


Effect 


• Launch Control automatically shifts up using the shortest possible gearshift times and 
performance-optimized shift points as long as the driver keeps the accelerator pedal fully 
depressed. 

• The start flag in the instrument cluster remains active. 

A renewed Launch Control start is possible as long as the transmission oil temperature satisfies the 
preconditions for this. 

Automatic deactivation 

• The driver leaves (even if only briefly) the accelerator pedal full-load range during acceleration. 


A 

A manual intervention in the automatic upshift, for example via the gearshift paddles on the steering 
wheel or the gear selector lever, does not interrupt the Launch Control process. 


48 











F85/F86 Complete Vehicle 

4. Engine/Powertrain 

If one of these preheating/precooling conditions is breached, it is not possible to activate the Launch 
Control. 

Also at excessive transmission oil temperature (e.g. repeat Launch Control or race-like start), 
activation is blocked up until an acceptable temperature threshold is reached. 

The start flag goes out with every deactivation and the automatic forced upshift is cancelled. 

A 

Premature wear occurs as a result of the high load of the vehicle with use of the launch control. 


A 

A mechanical emergency transmission release is available and can only be accessed under the 
vehicle. An electronic emergency transmission release is also implemented as in automatic 
transmissions of non Motorsport vehicles. For towing instructions, please observe the information 
in the Owner's Handbook of the vehicle.

4.2.3. Flexible disc, Drive shaft and output shafts 

Flexible disc 

The flexible disc has been adapted to the increased power level for the F85/F86. The flexible disc is, in 
contrast to the FI 5/FI 6,14 mm wider and now measures 44 mm in width. The flexible disc in the F85/ 
F86 has increased in diameter to 110 mm, likewise corresponding to 14 mm in comparison with the 
FI 5/FI 6. 

Drive shaft 

The drive shaft of the F85/F86 is a steel shaft, the heaviest and most stable drive shaft that has ever 
been used on a BMW or BMW M vehicle. The drive shaft, the center mount, the flange on the flexible 
disc to the transfer box and the flange on the rear axle differential have been adapted in terms of 
design and strength to the enormous power of the F85/F86. The flexible disc to the transfer box and to 
the rear axle differential is a common part in terms of design. 

The bolt connections of the drive shaft to the transfer box through the flexible disc have been adapted 
in terms of their larger-diameter to accommodate the larger-dimensioned flexible disc. 

Drive shaft, front 

The drive shaft (front) is a common part for the FI 5/FI 6 and therefore corresponds in its dimensions 
and design to the drive shaft (front) known from the FI 5 and FI 6. 

Output shafts, rear 

The flexible joints of the output shafts have been adapted in terms of design and strength to the higher 
power in the F85/F86. 

Drive flanges, rear 

The drive flanges (rear) have been adapted to the F85/F86 and have additional retaining pins for 
accommodating the M compound brake discs. 

Output shaft, front 

The output shafts (front) are a common part of the output shafts known from the FI 5 and FI 6.

4.2.4. Service information 

Transmission oil circuit 

For work required on the oil circuit of the automatic transmission, for example after an accident, or if 
the oil circuit has to be opened due to a repair, there must be maximum cleanliness. This includes: 

• Optimal cleaning of the outer oil circuit areas before disassembly of the components or 
opening the oil circuit. 

• Immediate closure of openings and lines after disassembly without delay and using clean 
original plugs. Do not use unsealed components or replacement parts of the oil circuit without 
checking for cleanliness and where possible competent repair. 

• The workbay in which an automatic transmission is opened must be extremely clean and 
secured against dirt contamination, also during work interruptions. For example by sufficiently 
clean and lint-free cover. 

Lifetime oil filling 

Currently, as with the E7x M with automatic transmission, for the F85/F86 with M automatic 
transmission a transmission oil change is not required at 2000 km / 1 200 miles (pre-delivery check) or 
with every third engine oil change. 

Rear axle differential (final drive unit) 

Both F85/F86 vehicles are equipped with Dynamic Performance Control as standard equipment. A 
rear axle differential oil change is required at 2000 km / 1 200 miles (running in check) and at every fifth 
engine oil change (at approximately each 50,000 miles). Note: There are three drain plugs on the rear 
differential. However only the oil in the center section of the QMVH needs to be changed as the two 
outer sections of the differential are filled with long-term rated oil. 

During the oil change, after allowing the oil to fully drip out of the center section, fill with SAF-XO oil 
(ETK # 33 11 7 695 240) and pour 0.95 liters (exactly 1.0 qt). DO NOT FILL TO THE LOWER EDGE 
OF THE FILLING HOLE!

5.1. Axles 


5.1.1. Front axle 

The double-wishbone front axle known from the FI 5/FI 6 is used as the front axle. The front axle has 
been lowered by 10 mm in comparison with the standard suspension on the F85/F86. The upper 
A-arm has been adapted by a repair wishbone from the FI 5/FI 6 spare parts range in order to achieve 
the M-specific greater camber values for a sportier suspension setting. The rubber mounts for 
connecting to the front axle support of the lower wishbone and the tension strut have been matched 
for the F85/F86. The spring strut has been adapted by a separate damper variant together with the coil 
spring to the F85/F86 and bolted at the top by a newly dimensioned support bearing in the dome; in 
addition, the auxiliary damper, installed between the shock absorber and the support bearing on the 
piston rod, has been adapted. For further information on the double-wishbone front axle, please refer 
to the Technical Training Manual “FI 5 Complete Vehicle”. 


5.1.2. Steering 

Within the framework of the EfficientDynamics measures for the F85/F86, the steering used is a 
rack-and-pinion steering with electrical steering wheel support “M Servotronic based on an EPS”. 


53 




F85/F86 Complete Vehicle 
5. Chassis/Driving Dynamics Systems 

For power assistance during steering an electric motor is housed parallel to the rack at the steering 
gear housing, the power transmission is effected via a ball screw. 

As components of M Servotronic (EPS) the ratio of the rack has been specifically adapted for the F85/ 
F86. With this measure the development of the steering was able to be coordinated to the typical M 
properties. Special attention was paid here to the typical M features: 

• Direct steering sensation 

• Driving condition feedback 

• Dynamic driving in the limit range 

The ratio of M Servotronic (EPS) has been adapted to the F85/F86; of particular note is the fact after 
an eighth of a turn of the steering wheel the rack ratio increases by 8 %.

5.1.3. Rear axle 

The Integral IV rear axle known from the FI 5/FI 6 is used as the rear axle. The rear axle has been 
lowered by 10 mm in comparison with the standard suspension on the F85/F86. The rear axle support 
of the F85/F86 is however supported by the incorporation of Cellasto discs at the top and bottom 
of the bolting points of the rear axle bearings. The incorporation of Cellasto discs prevents the rear 
axle support from tilting at the rear axle support bearings in the event of a marked load reversal. The 
rear axle support bearings have been adapted in terms of a harder design to the F85/F86. The shock 
absorbers have been adapted by a separate damper variant to the F85/F86 and are bolted at the top 
with a newly dimensioned support bearing; in addition, the auxiliary damper, installed between the 
shock absorber and the support bearing on the piston rod, has been adapted. The U-type bellows on 
the rear axle have been adapted by modified roll pistons to the F85/F86. For further information on the 
Integral IV rear axle, please refer to the Technical Training Manual “FI 5 Complete Vehicle”.

The front brake is completely F85/F86-specific. It is a large perforated and ventilated M compound 
brake disc combined with a four-piston fixed caliper. The use of the six-piston brake caliper has 
increased the friction surface of the individual brake pads by 30 % compared with the E7x M. 

This measure has positively influenced the braking power and reduce the fading properties compared 
with the E7x M. 

Compared with the E7x M, the brake disc has the same dimensions, but the friction ring thicknesses 
and cooling ducts of the brake discs have been M-specifically optimized. 

All front brake calipers are blue with a colored M logo.

Tires: Non-Runflat 

Tires without run-flat technology are used on the F85/F86. So-called UHP tires (Ultra-High- 
Performance tires) without run-flat properties are used. Tires without run-flat properties are softer in 
the sidewall area and afford the handling and comfort benefits that are wanted in a BMW M vehicle. 

The components of the above-listed wheel/tire combinations have been developed specially for the 
F85/F86. This can be recognized by the star on the outer side of the tire, among other things. 

Other combinations may have a negative effect on the performance and the driveability of the F85/ 
F86. 


5.3. Driving dynamics systems 

The F85/F86 is equipped as standard with Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM and Dynamic Drive) 
and Integrated Chassis Management (Dynamic Performance Control and M Servotronic). 

Active steering is not offered in the F85/F86. Both vehicles have a M Servotronic system based on 
electromechanical power steering (EPS) with a more direct, variable steering gear ratio. 

All Vertical Dynamics Management system have been M-specifically coordinated. 

The M-specific coordination of the driving dynamics (longitudinal, transverse and vertical) was 
effected on the Nurburgring Nordschleife. The main criteria were handling and the lap times. 

5.3.1. Vertical Dynamics Management 

Dynamic Drive 

Active Roll Stabilization (ARS - Dynamic Drive), as known from the FI 5/FI 6 basic vehicles, is used on 
the F85/F86. 

The anti-roll bars and the front and rear axles are separated and can be connected together using a 
hydraulic swivel motor. Dynamic Drive can very quickly generate a torque at the anti-roll bars in order 
to stabilize the vehicle. For straight-ahead driving the two halves of the anti-roll bars are disconnected. 

The settings of Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) are coupled to VDM-EDC: 


58 


VDM Comfort = ARS Comfort 
VDM Sport = ARS Comfort 
VDM Sport+ = ARS Sport 





F85/F86 Complete Vehicle 

5. Chassis/Driving Dynamics Systems 

For further information on Dynamic Drive, please refer to the Technical Training Manual “FI 5 
Complete Vehicle”. 

VDM 

Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM), as known from the FI 5/FI 6 basic vehicle, is used on the F85/ 
F86. 

VDM is an electronic damper control system (EDC) for controlling vertical dynamics. The VDM control 
unit calculates individual control commands for the electromagnetic valves in the shock absorber, 
based on the information input about: 

• the body and wheel acceleration 

• current lateral and longitudinal acceleration 

• driving speed 

• and the steering wheel position. 

Based on this measured data, the VDM control unit calculates the control commands to be sent to 
the electromagnetic valves in the shock absorbers for each individual wheel according to the road 
profile and driving situation. This means that the damping forces will always be applied according to 
requirements. 

VDM can be configured by the driver via the M Drive menu in the Drive or the keypad in the center 
console. 

For further information on VDM, please refer to the Technical Training Manual “FI 5 Complete Vehicle”. 

Electronic ride height control (EHC) 

Electronic ride height control (EHC), as featured in the FI 5/FI 6 basic vehicles, is used in the F85/F86. 

In order to be able to maintain the ride comfort, the ground clearance and the spring travel 
independent of the vehicle load or trailer load, a self-levelling suspension can be used on the rear axle. 

For further information on EHC, please refer to the Technical Training Manual “FI 5 Complete Vehicle”.

Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) is the transverse dynamics system network. This control unit 
coordinates the interaction between M Servotronic (EPS), DSC, VDM, engine control and Dynamic 
Performance Control. 

Dynamic Performance Control (QMVH) 

Dynamic Performance Control is the further development of the intelligent four-wheel drive xDrive. 

To date, the drive torque could only be distributed between front and rear axle. Dynamic Performance 
Control now also allows a distribution of the drive torque at the rear axle. The familiar rear axle 
differential is extended with two variable ratio transmissions, each comprising a double planetary gear 
and an electric multiple disc brake. The system is already known from the E71. 

The settings of Dynamic Performance Control are coupled to longitudinal dynamics management: 

• DSC On = QMVH Comfort 

• DSC MDM = QMVH Sport 

• DSC Off = QMVH Sport 

For further information on Dynamic Performance Control, please refer to the Technical Training Manual 
“FI 5 Complete Vehicle” and “E71 Complete Vehicle”. 


5.3.3. Longitudinal dynamics management 

Longitudinal dynamics management is performed by DSC. 

DSC 9+ from Bosch, as featured in the FI 5/FI 6 production vehicles, is used in the F85/F86. 

DSC 9+ has been M-specifically coordinated to match the M compound brake system. Furthermore, 
DSC 9+ has been integrated into the M Dynamic Mode (MDM). Further adaptations have been made 
to coordinate DSC 9+ with Dynamic Performance Control and the M8HP automatic transmission. 

In M Dynamic Mode (MDM) the control threshold of the brake interventions is expanded/raised and the 
engine power reduction by ASC is applied significantly later. This enables driver-oriented dynamic and 
sporty driveability. 

The “DSC” driving dynamics button or the configuration in the M Drive menu is used to switch 
between DSC ON, MDM and DSC OFF. The button obtains ground from ICM and sends back a ground 
signal on actuation to ICM. ICM forwards this information on the FlexRay data bus to DSC. 

Longitudinal dynamics can be configured by the driver via the M Drive menu in the iDrive or the keypad 
in the center console. 

For further information on longitudinal dynamics management, please refer to the Technical Training 
Manual “FI 5 Complete Vehicle”.

The following deviations exist in comparison with the standard FI 5/FI 6: 

PT-CAN 

The S63B44T2 engine exclusively has the DME variant MEVD17.2.H in a master-slave connection. 

In place of the electronic transmission control (EGS) the M automatic transmission with Drivelogic 
(M EGS) is used and instead of the gear selector lever (GWS) the M gear selector lever (M GWS) with 
Drivelogic button is used. The SCR control unit is omitted. 

FlexRay 

The electromechanical power steering (EPS) is omitted, with M Servotronic (EPS) being used instead.

6.2. On-board information 

6.2.1. M instrument cluster 

The M instrument cluster of the F85/F86 is based on the instrument cluster from the Fix M5/M6. 
The respective scales of the instrument cluster are market- and vehicle-specific. 

The following M-specific changes exist in comparison with the FI 5/FI 6: 

Round instruments: 

• Speed and engine speed display correspond to the drive concept 
(330 km/h / 200 mph, 8000 rpm) 

• Typical M red needle, lighting of the dial in white (also during the day 
without driving light), M inscription. 



64 



F85/F86 Complete Vehicle 
6. Vehicle Electr. Syst/On-board Info 

M-specific displays: 

• MDM M dynamic mode symbol in place of the DTC 

• Ml = M Drivel 

• M2 = M Drive2 

• Display of gear 

• Display of Drivelogic (bar symbol such as a button) 

• Display of system status: engine dynamics, damper control and M Servotronic. 

In the instrument cluster the current configuration of the engine dynamics, damper control and M 
Servotronic systems is shown in the bottom part of the rev counter field. This function can be activated 
under “Settings” in the Configuration menu display. 



F85/F85 M Drive menu 

The confirmation of the M Drive settings for DSC and transmission is also effected centrally in the 
instrument cluster. 

For setting/adjustment work in the engine dynamics, EDC and M Servotronic systems the response of 
the button activation is also effected as a list in the instrument cluster.

6.2.2. M Head-Up display (option SA 610) 

The optional color head-up display, depending on the national-market version, can switch to the 
M-specific display. 

The following information/parameters can be shown: 

• Shift point indicator by Shift light function 

• Engine speed over rev counter range 

• Transmission shift level 

• Vehicle speed 

• Speed limit info (option SA 8TH) 

• No-overtaking indicator (not US) 



The M-specific display for corresponding configuration in the M Drive menu is activated via the M 
buttons on the steering wheel or by selecting it from the Head-up display configuration menu.

6.2.3. M Drive menu 

The M Drive menu can be found in the Settings menu. There are two individually selectable M Drive 
configurations, M Drivel and M Drive2. 

The settings made there are called up by pressing the appropriate buttons on the multifunction 
steering wheel.

M2 Button 


Two M buttons are available on the steering wheel. 

The activation of an M Drive configuration is displayed by a Ml or M2 symbol in the instrument cluster. 
The corresponding symbol flashes if for example ABS or DSC adjust upon activation of request. 

A renewed activation is only possible if the control is completed.

F85/F86 M Drive combination display 


During the journey a requested configuration can be temporarily changed at any time until “Ignition 
OFF”. The corresponding driving dynamics button must be operated for this purpose. The Ml or M2 
symbol in the instrument cluster goes out. 

An efficient/comfortable configuration is set by default in the factory for the Ml button and a sporty 
configuration for the M2 button. This setting can be adapted in the M Drive menu to the customer's 
needs and also reset again to the factory setting. Each M button is individually configured and the 
overall configuration is also assigned to the vehicle remote control being used. 

The following functions and configurations can be selected and set: 

Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

• “ON” Maximum possible driving stability. 

• “MDM” Reduced stabilizing interventions. Allows driving with greater 
longitudinal and lateral acceleration on a dry roadway. 

• “OFF” Stability control switched off. ABS control remains active. 


Engine dynamics control incl. ASD (Active Sound Design) 

• Sport + Response spontaneous and direct, with maximum dynamics. 

• Sport Dynamic, sporty response. 

• Efficient Comfortable response (city traffic, snow), minimized consumption. 


Electronic Damper Control 

• Sport + Consistently sporty 

• Sport Balanced 

• Comfort Comfort-optimized tuning

M Servotronic (EPS) 

• Sport + High steering force, significant feedback 

• Sport Medium steering force, noticeable feedback 

• Comfort Low steering force 

Head-up display 

• M view 

• Unchanged 


Drivelogic 

• Drivelogic program "S" switch position (bar) 1 -3 

• Drivelogic program "D" switch position (bar) 1 -3 

Configuration quick save 

The modified setting or a new setting performed using the driving dynamics button can also be 
assigned permanently to one of the two M buttons on the steering wheel. The corresponding M 
button on the steering wheel must be held down for a longer period. The current configuration is 
assumed and overwrites the previously saved setting. This enables a quick adaptation or saving 
without calling up the M Drive menu. 

A_ 

If the driver is not aware that holding down an M button overwrites the current configuration/setting, 
this may lead to an unjustified customer complaint. 


Active configuration 

During the journey the desired ideal coordination of the individual driving stability controls is 
determined using the buttons and then before "Ignition OFF" one of the two M buttons on the steering 
wheel is pressed for a long period. 


6.3. Active Sound Design (ASD) 

The Active Sound Design (ASD) is described in a separate Training Reference Manual within the 
framework of the FI 0 M5. 

The ASD settings are coupled to the engine dynamics control settings: 


Engine dynamics Efficient = ASD Comfort 
Engine dynamics Sport = ASD Sport 
Engine dynamics Sport+ = ASD Sport+
