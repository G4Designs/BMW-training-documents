System Components 


MED 9.2.1 Engine Control Modules - New Features: This Bosch Engine M anagement 
System is introduced for more stringent emission reguirements as well as reducing fuel 
consumption and increasing driving performance. Flash EEPROMs (additional 1MB flash 
memory) are used as the storage medium for program data, fault code memory as well as 
the adaptation values. 

The 134 pin MED 9.2.1ECMs are manu¬ 
factured by Bosch to BMW specifica¬ 
tions. The ECM is the SKE (standard 
shell construction) housing and uses 5 
modular connectors. 

For testing, use the Universal Adapter 
Set (break-out box) Special Tool: #90 88 

6 121 300 

The ECMs work in combination with the 
Valvetronic Control Module. The N73 
engine has a total of 5 control modules 
to manage the engine functions: 

1. MED 9.2.1 ECM 2 - overall engine management 

2. MED 9.2.1 ECM 1 - overall engine management 

3. Valvetronic Control Module - intake valve lift 

4. High pressure fuel injector control module 
(HDEV) - activates injector group for one bank 

5. High pressure fuel injector control module 
(HDEV) - activates injector group for one bank 



These modules are located in the elec¬ 
tronic box in the engine compartment 
together with the Integrated Voltage 
Supply Module (6). 

The ECM controls an electric cooling fan 
in the base of the electronic box to draw 
in cool air from the passenger compart¬ 
ment.

Principle of Operation 

The ME 9.2 Engine Management System from the N62 engine provides the basis for the 
MED 9.2.1 Engine Management System. 

The main distinguishing features of the MED 9.2.1 are: 

Extended computer capacity (additional 1MB flash) 

Modified oxygen sensor chip which permits detailed diagnosis of the oxygen sensors 
One MED 9.2.1 control module for each cylinder bank 

Power is supplied to the high pressure fuel injectors for each cylinder bank by a high 
pressure fuel injector control module (HDEV) 

Omission of DISA and variable intake manifold activation (N62) 

Three knock sensors for each cylinder bank 
Activation of the auxiliary air flaps in the air cleaner housing 
Rail pressure sensor 
Fuel guantity control valve 

An MED 9.2.1 control module is used for each cylinder bank. Both control modules are 
the same design and are classified into ECM 1 and ECM 2 by the programming. ECM 1 
receives the input signals from a sensor or switch: 

Accelerator pedal module 
Oil condition sensor 
Alternator 

Coolant temperature 
Oil pressure 

ECM 1 transmits these signals via the Local-CAN bus to ECM 2. All further input signals 
are transmitted directly to the control module responsible forthe relevant cylinder bank (see 
overview pages 5 and 6). 

Output signals which relate to not just one cylinder bank (e.g. electric fuel pump or exhaust 
flap) are transmitted by ECM 1 to the corresponding actuators. The crankshaft sensor sig¬ 
nal is transmitted simultaneously to both control modules. 

The MED 9.2.1 regulates the injected fuel guantity. For this purpose, the MED 9.2.1 
receives the rail pressure sensor signals and regulates this pressure with the fuel guantity 
control valve according to the value defined by the program map. This ensures that a 
defined guantity of fuel is injected overthe injection period.

Integrated Voltage Supply Module (IVM) 

The IVM contains integral relays, replaceable fuses and offers a convenient splice point for 
harness connections. The IVM serves as a central power supply for Engine Management 
(including Valvetronic), Electronic Transmission and DSC. This diagram is a partial repre¬ 
sentation of the IVM for Engine Electronics.

Indirect Signals and Wiring 

The EC Ms are not directly connected to the OBD diagnostic connector. The OBD diag¬ 
nostic connector is connected to the ZGM . Both EC Ms are connected to the ZGM (cen¬ 
tral gateway module) by the PT-CAN bus. ECM 2 is also connected via the Local-CAN bus 
to ECM1. The ECMs are also connected to the Valvetronic control module and HDEV con¬ 
trol modules by the Local-CAN bus. Valvetronic faults are stored in the ECMs. 

The ECMs are classified into ECM 1 and ECM 2 by the wire harness connections (color 
coded) and location. ECM 1 receives the input signals from a sensor or switch and trans¬ 
mits these signals via the Local-CAN bus to ECM 2. All further input signals are transmit¬ 
ted directly (via hardwire harness) to the control module responsible for the relevant cylin¬ 
der bank. 

Output signals which are required for both cylinder banks are transmitted by ECM 1 to the 
corresponding actuators. The crankshaft sensor signal is transmitted simultaneously to 
both control modules.

Air Management 


Auxiliary Air Flaps: Each air cleaner housing incorporates an auxiliary air flap in its side 
wall. The auxiliary airflaps supply the engine with enough air volume to attain the maximum 
performance. The auxiliary airflaps are closed in the lower rpm ranges so that only cooler 
ambient air is drawn in for hot idling and stop and go driving. 


The auxiliary air flaps are actuated by vacuum diaphragms which are located inside the air 
cleaner housings. Both diaphragms are supplied with vacuum from a common solenoid 
valve. 


The auxiliary air flaps are fully opened by the 
EC M: 

In driving position "D" with kickdown 
operation from 3500 rpm 

In driving position "S" from 3000 rpm 
and simultaneous full load recognition. 

10-15% additional air is drawn in from the engine compartment when the auxiliary air flaps 
are open. It is not necessary to draw in additional cold air from outside the engine com¬ 
partment since the engine compartment is adequately ventilated at full load. 



Intake Manifold Pressure Sensors: The pressure sensors (one per bank) are located in 
the back of intake manifold (1 peizo-electric). The voltage supply from the EC Ms is 5 V. The 
varying resistance of the sensors is dependent on manifold pressure. The output voltage 
signal is processed by the EC Ms. The intake manifold pressure is calculated by the EC Ms 
and is compared with the ambient pressure (internally measured in ECM 1). 


A minimum intake manifold vacu¬ 
um of 50 mbar is required for the 
fuel tank evaporative purge func¬ 
tion. 

This vacuum is set by the elec¬ 
tronic throttle valves (4) and mon¬ 
itoring with the intake manifold 
pressure sensors. 

Shown to the right is the intake 
manifold (upside down) with both 
sensors (1).

Fuel Supply System: For the N73 engine, minor modifications have been made to the fuel 
supply system to adapt it to the direct injection system. The additional features are: 


Leakage line 

Electric fuel pump with increased delivery 

The N73 in tank electric fuel pump is a roller cell type (EKP Bosch 3.1) with an increased 
delivery pressure of 6 bar This pressure is reguired to adeguately supply the high pressure 
fuel pumps. 

Fuel Supply System Components: 

Fuel tank (24) 

Surge chamber (20) 

Fuel pump (21) 

Two suction jet pumps (23) 

Outlet protection valve (25) 

Internal Tank Fuel Circuit Operation 

The fuel pump supplies fuel from the surge chamber via the fuel filter (located next to the 
frame rail under the driver's floor) to the high pressure fuel pumps (HDP). The fuel pump 
always pumps more fuel than the engine reguires in all operating conditions. The fuel pres¬ 
sure regulator built into the fuel filter adjusts the pressure to 6 bar and feeds the excess fuel 
in the return flow back into the tank. 

The pressure regulator valve in the return flow sets a return pressure of 1.0 - 1.5 bar. This 
pressure prevents fuel vapor locks in the return flow and also ensures operation of the two 
suction jet pumps. 

The fuel flows from the pressure regulator valve on to an intersection point where the fuel 
return flow is split. Some of the fuel flows through the suction jet pump in the left half of 
the tank via the internal fuel line to the surge chamber. The suction jet pump acts like a 
venturi tube which draws the fuel from the left half of the tank into the right half. 

The other amount of diverted fuel flows via the second internal fuel supply directly to the 

rig ht ha If of the ta n k a nd to the second suction jet pump. This pumps the fuel from the light 
half of the tank into the surge chamber to ensure that the surge chamber is always filled 
with enough fuel in all driving conditions and takes full advantage of the resen/e capacity.

High Pressure Injection System: A BMW gasoline direct injection system is used for the 
first time in the N73 engine series. Each fuel rail is supplied with fuel by a high pressure 
pump (HDP), which is driven via a bucket tappet by a triple lobe cam on the exhaust 
camshaft. 

The two high pressure pumps are supplied with fuel by the electric fuel pump (EKP), which 
is located in the fuel tank. The high pressure fuel injectors are connected to a pressure rail 
(accumulator) for each cylinder bank. The two rails are not interconnected.

High Pressure Pumps: A single cylinder high pressure pump is used for each cylinder 
bank. The pumps are mounted on the cylinder heads and driven via bucket tappets by 
triple cam lobes on the exhaust camshafts. Each pump has three connecting lines: feed 
line, high pressure line and leakage line.

MED 9.2.1 



























Fuel is delivered to each high pressure pump through the feed line at a pressure of 6 bar 
from the electric in tank fuel pump via a T-branch. In the pump, the fuel passes through 
the inlet valve (2) into the high pressure area (3). 

As the pump plunger is forced up by the camshaft, the fuel is pressurized (up to 120 bar) 
in this area. The pressurized fuel is then forced out through the high pressure line to the 
fuel rail. The outlet valve (4) prevents back flow from the rail into the high pressure pump. 

Due to the extreme pressure on and around the plunger shaft, a small amount of fuel (max. 
1 litre per hour) flows past the plunger shaft against the sealing ring (9). This also serves 
as lubrication for the plunger shaft. The sealing ring provides a seal between the fuel side 
of the pump and the engine oil at the pump drive. 

To relieve the pump pressure (up to 120 bar) at the sealing ring, the pressure is reduced in 
two stages, at which point the fuel returns through the leakage line to the tank. The pump 
pressure is reduced down to 6 bar at the annular groove (7) because it is connected by a 
channel (8) to the feed area of the pump. The fuel flow from this channel is regulated by 
the fuel quantity control valve (M 5V). 

Below the annular groove, some fuel flows past the pump plunger against the sealing ring. 
At this point the fuel pressure is virtually reduced to atmosheric pressure, which is sufficient 
to return the fuel through the leakage line to the tank. 


Fuel Quantity Control Valves (MSV): The fuel quantity control valve (10) is installed in the 
high pressure pump to regulate the fuel delivery rate as required based on load and engine 
rpm. This valve opens a channel from the high pressure chamber (3) to the feed area allow¬ 
ing excess fuel to return to the feed area. 

When the pump plunger is at it's lowest position, the valve is energized closed by the ECM . 
The valve is de-energized as soon as the injection pressure calculated by the ECM is 
reached during the upwards travel of the pump plunger. The valve is now opened to allow 
excess fuel to return to the feed area. This switching is repeated three times per camshaft 
revolution because the drive cam for the pump has three lobes. 

The pulsations generated in the pump during the process are absorbed by the pressure 
attenuator spring (12). The pressure attenuator is sealed by a diaphragm (11) from the 
pump feed area.

Increase the engine speed to 2000 rpm and

MED 9.2.1 


















































Fuel Rails (pressure accumulator): The fuel 
is stored in the fuel rail at a pressure between 50 
and 120 bar for distribution to the fuel injectors. 
The fuel rail connects to the injectors through 
brass coupling connections. 

Due to length and position compensation 
between the rail and the fuel injectors, brass 
coupling connections are used in order that the 
fuel injector O-ring can float inside this coupling. 



DSC00630 


Pressure Limiting Valves: Each fuel rail contains an integral pressure limiting valve (1 
below). This valve opens from a pressure of 125 bar to prevent damage to the injection 
system. The outlet of this valve is connected by a line to the high pressure pump fuel feed 
line. The valve can open briefly: 

When no fuel is required by the fuel injectors (fuel cutoff when vehicle is coasting) 

or 

During the afterheating (hot soak) phase when the hot engine is turned off.

DSC00632 


Rail Pressure Sensors: Each fuel rail incorporates a rail pressure sensor (2 above). The 
sensor is a pressure dependent resistor and the voltage (5 V) is supplied by the EC M . The 
increasing system pressure alters the sensor resistance. 

According to the fuel pressure applied, the rail pressure sensor outputs a varying voltage 
signal as the rail pressure increases from 0.5 V (0 bar) to 4.5 V (140 bar). If the rail pres¬ 
sure sensor malfunctions, the fuel quantity control valve (on the HDP) is activated with a 
back up function (set value) by the ECM .

MED 9.2.1 



Return Shut-off Valve: The return shut-off valve prevents a pressure drop in the system 
while the engine is stopped and is located in the leakage line. When the engine is started, 
the valve is energized after a slight delay to prevent a pressure drop in the feed area of the 
high pressure pump (cavitation). 

While the engine is running, this valve is sup¬ 
plied with system voltage (from the ECM Main 
Relay) and activated by the ECM providing a 
ground path which allows leakage fuel to return 
to the tank. 


1. High pressure pump 

2. Leakage line 

3. Return shut-off valve 



Pressure Damper Vent Valve: The Pressure Damper Vent Valve provides a controlled 
outlet for fuel/vapors that accumulate in the Pressure Attenuator (damper) chamber in the 
top of each High Pressure Pump. This is a 3/2 way electrically controlled valve (KL15 from 
the IVM , ground path provided by ECM 1) that provides: 


A circuit for fuel to return to the fuel tank when energized (KLI5 on) or 
A circuit forfuel vapors to vent into the evaporative system when de-energized (KL15 off)

When the engine is running, a slight amount of fuel may accumulate in the Pressure 
Attenuator upper chambers due to natural leakage through the internal diaphram (extreme 
pressure). This fuel (circuit) is returned to the fuel tank by combining with the Leakage Line 
of the Return Shut-off Valve. The Pressure Damper Vent Valve provides a passage to com¬ 
bine these two circuits when the ignition is switched on (KLI5) and isolates the Evaporative 
Emission circuit. 

When the engine is not running, fuel vapors remain in these chambers and is routed into 
the Evaporative Emission circuit. This is accomplished by Pressure Damper Vent Valve 
blocking the passage from the Return Shut-off Valve (KLI5 off) and opening a passage to 
the circuit leading from the Active Charcoal Canister to the Evaporative Emission Valve. 


High Pressure Fuel Injectors (HDEV): The high pressure fuel injectors are designed 
essentially the same as conventional fuel injectors. They are secured by a taper in the cylin¬ 
der head and sealed by a Teflon ring against the combustion chamber. 


The 0-ring seals the top of the injector and floats inside the brass coupling connections on 
the fuel rail. Each fuel injector incorporates a single hole nozzle with a spray angle of 70 s 
to the piston crown.

To open the high pressure fuel injector, the nozzle needle is lifted off its seat when the sole¬ 
noid coil is energized. Due to the high injection pressure (up to 120 bar), the pressure 
spring is designed to accommodate a pressure force of 30 newtons (5 newtons for con¬ 
ventional fuel injectors). The pressure spring forces the nozzle needle onto its seat during 
closing with sufficient contact pressure.

Direct Injection System Control 


A high pressure fuel injector control module (HDEV) is used for each cylinder bank and is 
located in the engine compartment E box. The HDEV control module is supplied with sys¬ 
tem voltage from the ECM main relay (in the IVM). Data is transmitted from the EC Ms to 
the HDEV control modules for each high pressure fuel injector via the Local-Can bus. The 
HDEVs activate the injectors individually. 

Note: The high pressure fuel injectors are activated by the HDEV control modules with a 
voltage of 100 V and energized during the opening period with approx. 85 V.

HDEV Control Modules: The HDEV control modules contain pulse width modulated final 
output stages with high performance capacitors to transform the system voltage up to 85 
to 100 volts. Current flows in the output stages up to a specific cutoff value. This cutoff 
creates an induced voltage, e.g. 85 V, which is then charged to the high performance 
capacitors (boosters). The high pressure fuel injectors are actuated by this capacitor with 
2.8 to 16 amps of current.

Emissions Management - N73B60 Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) 


Oxygen Sensors: The N73 engine is fitted with a total of four oxygen sensors. One pla¬ 
nar broadband oxygen sensor (constant characteristic curve), which regulates the fuel-air 
mixture, is located upstream of each of the two catalytic converters. The catalytic converter 
assemblies are integral with the exhaust manifolds. 


There is a post catalytic converter sensor 
(Bosch LSH25) for each cylinder bank posi¬ 
tioned downstream of the catalytic converter 
which monitors the catalyst efficiency. 

This monitoring means that if the exhaust gas 
concentration is too high, a fault code is 
stored. The post catalyst sensors can also 
detect an emission relevant fault in a pre-cat¬ 
alyst oxygen sensor. 



N73 Oxygen Sensors 


Bosch LSU Planar Wideband Oxygen Sensor: The N73 engine is equipped with planar 
wideband oxygen sensors (pre-catalyst). The sensor is planar shaped (type of construc¬ 
tion) which is more compact and is made up of thin layers of zirconium dioxide (Zr02) 
ceramic films. This modular lamination structure enables the integration of several functions 
including the heating element which ensures the minimum operating temperature (750 2 C) 
is reached rapidly. 

In contrast to conventional oxygen sensors, the wideband features can measure not only 
at Lambda=l, but also in the rich and extremely lean range (Lambda=0.7 to complete 
atmospheric oxygen) very rapidly. 

The pump cell and reference cell are made of zirconium dioxide and each coated with two 
porous platinum electrodes. They are arranged so that there is a measuring gap between 
them. This measuring gap is connected by an inlet opening to the exhaust gas. The pump 
cell is controlled by the EC Ms applying voltage to the electrodes to initiate oxygen ion 
pumping across the porous membrane of the reference cell, providing a quicker response 
time. 

The pump current flow is proportional to the oxygen concentration (lean) or the oxygen 
requirement (rich). The pump is constantly working to maintain that the gas composition in 
the measuring gap is constantly at Lambda=l.

1. Is there a Test Plan available for the LSU oxygen sensor? 

2. Select Control Unit Functions (MED 9.2.1), Diagnosis Requests. Is there a status under 
the "Part Functions" column for observing the LSU oxygen sensor? 

List the status that apply to the oxygen sensor: 


3. Using the DISplus voltmeter, connect MFK2 to the full circuit of the oxygen sensor. 

(for example: pin 13 to pin 20 atECM 1 of LSU bankl). Start engine and allow warmup. 

Select Control Unit Functions (MED 9.2.1), Diagnosis Requests. Under the "J Part 
Functions" column for the LSU oxygen sensor, select: Oxygen-sensor control, Oxygen¬ 
sensor controller, Lambda value, Additive lambda adaptation and Multiplicative lambda 
adaptation - now select "Display". 

Ask the Instructor for assistance: 


4. With the engine mnning and the voltmeter displayed, introduce a vacuum leak. 


With the Minimum/Maximum feature selected, observe the voltage value and reconnect 
the hose. 

What is the minimum? V maximum? V 

5. Slowly disconnect the hose and allow the engine to run for approximately 1 - 2 minutes. 
Under the "Part Functions" column for the LSU oxygen sensor, record the values for: 

Oxygen-sensor control Additive lambda adaptation 

Oxygen-sensor controller Multiplicative lambda adaptation 

Lambda value 

Caution: Do not conduct this test for longer than 5 minutes! (allow engine to cool) 

6. What do the values from question 5 indicate?

Performance Controls 


Exhaust Flap: The 12.6 liter rear silencer (4) is fitted with an exhaust flap to keep noise to 
a minimum at engine idle speed and low rpm. The flap provides exhaust efficiency based 
on two effects: 

M immization of the cross section (slight back pressure) and the outlet noise level at low 
exhaust flow rates 

Large cross-section with low backpressure at high speeds and loads 


The exhaust flap is opened allowing additional flow when 
The transmission gear is engaged and 
The engine speed is approximately above 1,500 rpm 



A vacuum controlled diaphragm (2 - actuator mounted on the silencer) opens and closes 
the exhaust gas flap. The vacuum is supplied from the camshaft driven vacuum pump. 

The exhaust flap is opened with vacuum, and is sprung closed by the actuator (when vac¬ 
uum is not present). The procedure is carried out using a solenoid valve (1) which is elec¬ 
trically controlled by the EC M and located in the left rear luggage compartment (below the 
light assembly).
