M Chassis and Suspension 

Model: E60 M5, E63/64 M6 and E9x M models 
Production: From Start of Production 



After completion of this module you will be able to: 

• Identify the changes made to the suspensions of the M5, M6 and M3 when compared 
to the series production vehicles. 


• Explain the components used in the steering system of the M5, M6 and M3. 

• Identify the version of DSC used in the different M models. 

• Identify the braking system upgrades made to the M vehicles when compared 
to series production vehicles. 



E60 M5 


Body 

The E60 M5 utilizes the same body construction as the produc¬ 
tion based 5 Series E60. The main body is made of steel and the 
front end utilizes the familiar GRAV technology. 

GRAV or "gewichtsreduzierter aluminiumvorderbau“ is a light¬ 
weight aluminum front end which enhances the lightweight 


design of the vehicle. Almost the entire front end is made of 
aluminum. 

The transition to steel in the composite construction starts in the 
vicinity of the engine bulkhead. The reduced weight of the front 
end in particular contributes much to the ideal axle-load distribu¬ 
tion of 50:50.

Suspension Components 

The control arms and transverse links are made of aluminum and 
ensure high-precision tracking of the wheels. The highly innovative 
design principle with the special layout of the leading links and 


control arms ensures high-precision steering. The low axle loads, 
especially in the area of the front axle, also provide for a high 
degree of agility and familiar BMW handling characteristics.

EDC-K 


Selecting Program 


The continuously variable electronic clamping control (EDC-K) 
system used in the E65/66 is used in the E60 M5. 

The continuous Electronic Damping Control (EDC-K) absorbs 
vertical forces while driving and dampens these forces to the 
chassis. 

The forces are measured by two vertical acceleration sensors on 
the front axle (left and right) and one at the rear axle (right). The 
front sensors are located in the wheel housings and the rear on the 
trunk tray underneath the trunk ventilation ports. The dampening 
characteristics are mapped in the control module to continuously 
regulate the EDC-K providing maximum comfort. 

The EDC-K works with infinitely variable valves in the dampers to 
regulate the hydraulic fluid flow using electromagnetic control 
valves. EDC-K provides the actual damping force required at any 
time. 

The steering angle sensor is used along with the front wheel speed 
sensors to determine the lateral acceleration. 

The controller provides the opportunity to select from three basic 
settings: 

“Comfort” - Comfort-oriented coordination of shock absorbers 
and steering 

“Normal" - Offers a balanced mixture of the comfort and the 
sports program 

“Sport” - Consistently sporty coordination of shock absorbers 
and steering. 


To select between the three programs available, press the EDC 
button repeatedly: 

"Comfort": No LED lights up in the button. 

"Normal": One LED lights up in the button. 

"Sport": Both LEDs light up in the button. 

The last selected program is active each time the engine is started. 

You can also activate your preferred program with the button on the 
steering wheel. 



Note: For further information regarding vehicle settings 
refer to the Performance Controls section of this 
training material or the Vehicle Owner’s Manual.

Brakes 

The M5 has braking distances equal to top sports car levels. 
The new BMW M5 owes its enormous braking power to double 
piston aluminum brake calipers and perforated, ventilated com¬ 
pound (floating) brake rotors. 

The braking distance for the M5 is approximately 118ft from 
62 mph to a full stop. 



Front rotor of E60 M5 

The front rotors measurements are 374 x 36 mm. 
The rear rotors measure 370 x 24 mm. 



Rear rotor of E60 M5 


Rotors 

Both the front and rear rotors are cross drilled floating type. These 
ensure optimized heat dissipation, improved response, as well as 
reduction of unsprung masses. 

The rotor has an aluminum center section (hub) with pins embed¬ 
ded in a radial pattern that are “connected” to the rotor surface uti¬ 
lizing a free moving or floating configuration. This allows the rotor 
surface to contract and expand with the changes in temperature. 



Detail of Rotor Attachment Pins 



Detail of Rotor Alignment Pins on Hub 










The rotor is attached to the hub with two alien style screws and 
three alignment pins located on the hub. 

The rotor outer ring is cast and holes are drilled out to improve 
braking. The drilled surface allows gases that form between the 
brake pad and rotor to escape. Otherwise, there would be a thin 
film of “brake gases” between the surface of the rotor and the 
brake pads. 

Brake pads are made by gluing the friction material to a backing 
plate (metal). These are then baked in an oven to allow the glue 
to cure. While the brakes are heated, gasses are released and 
travel through the brake pads to the surface. This can be seen on 
any new brake pads as a lighter upper section of the brake pad (see 
picture below). 



Rear Brake Pads (“gasses”) 


Calipers 

The M5 utilizes dual piston brake calipers in the front and conven¬ 
tional single piston calipers in the rear.

Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

The E60 M5 is equipped with the Continental Teves Dynamic 
Stability Control System (DSC+) MK60E5. Although all E6x vehi¬ 
cles where updated to the Bosch traction control and stability sys¬ 
tem DSC8+ from 09/2005, the M5 still uses the Teves system. 

The MK60E5 system is also used in the E9x M3. The system is a 
further development of the MK60psi system. The abbreviation 
"psi" stands for "pressure sensor integrated" i.e. the two pressure 
sensors of the tandem master brake cylinder (THZ) have been 
combined to form one plausibility sensor and integrated in the 
hydraulic unit. 

The designation "E5" in MK60E5 signifies the 5 pressure sensors 
that are integrated in the hydraulic unit: One pressure sensor that 



measures the pressure from the tandem master brake cylinder THZ 
and four further sensors that measure the braking pressure of the 
respective wheel brake. 

This system offers functions that were not yet available with the 
previous system. 

MK60E5 added the following functions: 

• Brake Readiness 

• Dry Braking 

• Hill Ascent Assistant 

The features of this system distinctly enhance comfort during 
control intervention while facilitating even more precise individual 
wheel braking in connection with the analog control valves. 

This system made it possible to reduce the required braking dis¬ 
tance compared to previous systems. The E60 M5 has a braking 
distance of less than 118 feet from a speed of 62 mph (< 36 m 
from 100 km/h). 



Mounting Location of DSC Control Unit and Hydraulic Unit 



Compared to the standard DSC features, the MK60E5 in the E60 
M5 has been upgraded by the following additional functions: 

• MDynamic Mode (MDM is activated via the M-Drive) 

• Brake readiness (Brake Standby) 

• Dry braking 

• Hill ascent assistant 

The following functions are not used on the M5: 

• Performance control (FLR) 

• Soft stop 

• Fading brake support (FBS) 

• Dynamic traction control (DTC) 

Operating Modes of the MK60E5 

In principle, the MK60E5 has 3 different operating modes: 

• DSC ON 

• DSC OFF 

• MDynamic mode 

There is no DTC function in connection with the M5. However, 
similar to DTC mode, corresponding control thresholds are raised 
by activating the MDM. 

MDynamic Mode (MDM) 

MDM gives the performance-oriented driver the option of driving 
the car with controlled float angle and longitudinal slip without DSC 
intervening. The control system intervenes only when the physical 
limits are exceeded. MDM is activated via the M-Drive. 


The control thresholds are not static but rather, as the speed 
increases, they approach the thresholds of DSC ON mode. 

The stability control thresholds are identical as from a speed of 
approximately 125 mph (200 km/h) in order not to overtax the driver 
in the high speed range. 

Hill Ascent Assistant 

Assistance is provided when driving off on uphill gradients by 
briefly maintaining a specific brake pressure in the wheel brakes. 
This function is active only when the transmission is not in "N" 
position and the handbrake is released. 

DSC ON/OFF has no influence in this case. 

The tilt angle (uphill and downhill gradient) is calculated from the 
measured value of the longitudinal acceleration sensor. The DSC 
calculates the necessary holding pressure based on the uphill or 
downhill gradient. 

After releasing the brake pedal, the braking pressure is immediately 
decreased to the calculated holding pressure which is then 
reduced in stages after a maximum time delay of 0.7 seconds. The 
vehicle will start off after approximately 1 seconds if the driver does 
not press the accelerator pedal. 

The longitudinal acceleration sensor is assigned to the SMG 
system. The DSC control unit receives this signal over the bus net¬ 
work. 

Note: This function is also active on an incline with reverse 
gear engaged 

Condition Based Service (CBS) 

The MK60E5 calculates and evaluates the condition of the brake 
pads. In contrast to the E60 Series, the M5 is equipped with two 
brake pad sensors on the front axle.

Front Axle Carrier 

The front axle carrier is an aluminum alloy construction. In order to 
ensure optimum strength and torsional rigidity, a high-pressure 
forming technique has been used to manufacture certain sections. 

Aluminum has been chosen for its lightweight and strength proper¬ 
ties. The components of the front axle are joined together by an 
aluminum welding process.

As shown in the diagram, the clamp height has been increased on 
the Z-axis from 52 mm on the E9x series model (left) to 76 mm on 
the E9x M3 (right). 

The front spring strut now has an additional support. The wheel 
carrier has also been modified to compensate for the increased 
drive and dynamic forces. 

The lower contact face of the spring strut in the E9x M3 has a 
cone, which is positioned firmly in the wheel carrier. In E9x vehi¬ 
cles, however, the front spring strut has a parallel construction and 
is only held in place by the clamping force. 

This design change and the increased clamp height accommodate 
the increased reaction forces of the spring strut and increase the 
overall stability of the wheel suspension. 

During assembly, the M3 spring strut is pulled into the lower cone 
using a new special tool. 

Note: Follow the installation and removal process accord¬ 
ing to the service repair instructions. 

Tension Strut 

The tension strut is similar to that used in the E9x series vehicles, 
but features an 'M'-specific harder rubber mount. 


Wheel Bearing Unit 

The M3 wheel bearing unit is identical to the E60 M5 wheel bear¬ 
ing unit. It has three dowel pins for the brake disc. 


Front Anti-roll Bar 

The weight-optimized front anti-roll bar was adapted for the M3 
and has a special rubber bearing material for more direct response. 
The hinged brackets are made out of an aluminum alloy (steel in 
E9x series vehicles). 


Wishbone 

The M control arm is completely new and is connected to the axle 
carrier and wheel carrier by two ball joints. It is manufactured out of 
forged aluminum alloy. 





Steering System 

The design of the rack-and-pinion steering system is the same as 
in the E9x series vehicles. The average variable overall ratio is 12.5 
(sports-oriented comared tol 6 in the E9x series). 

In the M3, the steering force support is controlled by the MSS60 
via the Servotronic valve. A speed dependent characteristic curve 
is stored in the MSS60 for this purpose. With the MDrive menu 


option, a second and even more sports oriented characteristic 
curve can be activated (see the chapter on MDrive). 

The steering oil is guided through the steering oil cooler before it 
returns to the oil reservoir. 

The E9x M3 is not available with active steering.

Rear Axle 

The rear axle carrier is constructed from steel sections which are 
welded together. All mounting points for the rear axle and suspen¬ 
sion components are formed or attached to the axle carrier making 
it an integral component. 

Nearly all components of the rear chassis have been revised, the 
aim is to achieve optimum sports vehicle kinematics, chassis stabil¬ 


ity and a more precise and direct response, with a simultaneous 
reduction in weight. 

This has been achieved by the careful selection of materials for the 
axle components and bearings, and through a modification of the 
axle geometry.

Wheel Carrier 

The attachment points for toe, camber, wishbone, longitudinal and 
traction struts have been positioned specifically for the 'M' model. 

Its overall dimensions allow for the larger M wheel to be fitted. The 
’M’ wheel carrier is fitted with a modified rubber mount connecting 
to the semi-trailing arm and a ball joint for the camber strut. 

Toe Struts 

The new ’M’ toe strut is forged from Aluminum. It is one-piece and 
has two integrated ball joints. 

Camber Struts 

The 'M' camber strut is a new lightweight component forged from 
Aluminum. Its design reduces the unsprung mass of the vehicle. 

Wishbone 

The new 'M' wishbone is forged from aluminum and has a modi¬ 
fied integrated ball joint and a rubber mount. 

Control Strut 

The semi-trailing arm is the only rear suspension strut that is taken 
from the E9x vehicles. It is connected further inwards on the rear 
axle carrier, only the rubber mount is new. 

Traction Strut 

The geometry of the forged aluminum 'M' traction strut has been 
revised. It now has a new integrated rubber mount for the wheel 
carrier. The ball joint for the rear axle carrier has been taken from 
the E9x series vehicles . 


Rear Shock Absorbers 

New M specific rear aluminum dampers are fitted to the M3. 
Electronic damper control - continuous (EDC-K), is available as an 
option. 

The integrated lower damper rubber mount has a support sleeve 
that improves the rigidity and stability between the damper and the 
camber strut.

Electronic Damper Control - Continuous (EDC-K) 

EDC-K is available for the first time in the E9x M3. EDC-K is an 
option and is based on the EDC-K in the E65 and E60 M5. 

Both dampers of one axis are always activated in parallel. The valve 
is installed internally in the damper in the damper oil system. 


console or preset via the MDrive menu and activated using the M 
button on the steering wheel (for more information, see the MDrive 
chapter). 

The input signals come from two vertical acceleration sensors in 
the front wheel arches and a third sensor in the rear right-hand 
wheel arch. 


The compression phase, and in particular the rebound phase, of 
the shock absorbers can be adjusted by the EDC-K depending on 
the input signals in a smooth transition from relatively comfortable 
to a harder sports setting. 

The driver can choose between three settings, the controlled pro¬ 
grams "Comfort" and "Normal", or the uncontrolled fixed setting 
"Sport". 

The program is selected using the EDC-K button on the center 


The steering column switch cluster sends the steering angle to the 
F-CAN. This is transmitted together with the wheel speeds from 
the DSC to the PT-CAN and evaluated in the EDC-K control unit. 

The longitudinal, lateral and vertical accelerations calculated as a 
result are used as a basis for regulation. 

The EDC-K button signal enters the junction box and is transmitted 
to the EDC-K on the PT-CAN.

Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) MK60E5 

The E9x M3 is equipped with the MK60E5 DSC system made by 
Continental Teves, which has been specifically adapted to its driv¬ 
ing dynamics. The "civilian" version is installed in several non-M 
models. 

The fundamental difference in both versions is the replacement of 
Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) with M Dynamic Mode (MDM). 
MDM has been adapted to suit sports car dynamism for experi¬ 
enced sports drivers. The permitted float angle and longitudinal 
slip in good environmental conditions (road, weather, etc.) are also 
equally high. 

Furthermore, the driving-performance control (FLR), soft stop and 
Fading Brake Support (FBS) functions are not required in the 'M' 
version. 

The braking readiness (applies the foot brake and the handbrake 
until the discs and drums are dry) and the gradient assistant func¬ 
tions have been adapted appropriately. 

Note: An M-specific version of the MK60E5 is installed in 
the E6x M5 and M6. For further information regard¬ 
ing DSC systems refer to the Chassis Dynamics 
training material available in TIS and ICR
