E60 M5 



The BMW M5 was launched in October 2005 in the US market. It 
is currently the most powerful M5 of all time and the first to exhibit 
this power potential at first glance. 

The basic M concept, however, remains unchanged. The E60 M5 
combines the qualities of a luxury class sedan with the power 
potential of a sports car. However, Its visual appearance is inten¬ 
tionally somewhat less discreet as its predecessor. The front and 
rear aprons are now slightly more prominent and, together with 
the rear spoiler, 4-pipe exhaust system and 19" wheels, and the 
M5 characteristic side gills unmistakably identify the M5 at first 
glance, even from the side. 


The highlight of the M5 is the VI0 engine derived from BMW- 
Williams Formula 1. With the governed limit at 8,250 rpm, it not 
only provides Formula 1 performance but also develops that typi¬ 
cal Formula 1 sound. 

Despite these features, the M5 still remains an understatement- 
product. Its exterior conveys a powerful yet still reserved appear¬ 
ance. At no point has its everyday suitability gained from the E60 
series been lost.

Body 

The E60 M5 combines the qualities of a luxury class sedan with 
the power potential of a sports car. Its visual appearance is inten¬ 
tionally somewhat less discreet as its predecessor. 

Features that make the E60 M5 stand out when compared to 
the 5 Series sedan are: 

• A rear spoiler has been added 

• Rear diffuser 

• The signature twin dual pipe exhaust system 

• Front and rear bumpers are now slightly more prominent 

• 19" wheels 

• M5-characteristic side gills 



Despite these features, the M5 still remains an understatement- 
product. Its exterior conveys a powerful yet still reserved appear¬ 
ance. 

The body structure of the M5 is taken from the production 5 Series 
vehicle. It utilizes GRAV technology (the entire front end of the vehi¬ 
cle is made of aluminum, not steel). 

















Exterior Design 


The exterior design of the M5 has a number of spectacular original 
features in comparison to the production version. 


Air inlets in the bumpers instead of fog lights. 


Lowered apron has an integrated front spoiler. 



In conjunction with sealing the engine compartment, the front 
bumper reduces lift on the M5's front axle by 50% in comparison 
to the standard car. 


The front spoiler, the diffuser, the rear spoiler lip and the special 
underside paneling provide the required down force in the M5. 


The highly visible and styl¬ 
ish grills in the side panel 
at the front are more than 
mere decoration and serve 
to create a through-flow of 
air. 



A special M-design door mirror. 



The sills also emphasize the sporty line as they wrap around and 
tie in with the front and rear bumpers. 



Special, extra-wide 285/35 ZR 19” tires on specifically styled 
9-1/2 inch rims at the rear and 255/40 ZR 19” tires on 8-1/2 inch 
rims on the front axle also adds to the sporty look. 


M Complete Vehicles

M Complete Vehicles 


The rear bumper of the vehicle does not only make the vehicle 
appear more sporty but includes an air diffuser to better improve 
the aerodynamics. 



The M5 continues with the signature M dual twin exhaust pipes 
started with the M Roaster. 


When compared with the production 5 Series, the front and rear 
bumper and side skirt have been changed. 


The rear deck lid comes 
with a spoiler. 

The rear deck lid no longer 
has a cylinder lock for trunk 
opening with a key. In case 
of an electrical failure, there 
is a mechanical release 
under the rear seat. It is an 
eyelet/loop with a Bowden 
cable that connects to the 
trunk actuator mechanism.

Interior Design 

The cockpit of the new BMW M5 is tailored to the requirements of 
the M driver, who looks for sports car performance and precision 
ergonomics. The redesigned instruments in the dashboard com¬ 
bined with the SMG gearshift paddles on the Multi-function steer¬ 
ing wheel and the presence of the MDrive button serve to create 
the unique M ambience. 

Distinctive M Instrument Cluster. 

The instrument cluster has been especially designed for the BMW 
M5. Chrome rings surround the two circular displays for the 
speedometer and rev counter. The scales are white and perma¬ 
nently illuminated, while the indicator needles glow in traditional 
M red. 



This conveys a unique, almost race-car like ambience. Arranged 
between the two circular gauges are the displays for SMG mode, 
current gear and engine oil level. 
















Center Console 

Illuminated Selector Lever 

The gearshift pattern on the SMG selector lever handle is perma¬ 
nently illuminated, and the current gear is highlighted. 

Located next to the selector lever are the buttons for the dynamic 
system settings: DME, DSC, EDC, and SMG Drivelogic. 


Front Seats 

The standard M Sports seats provide excellent levels of lateral sup¬ 
port to the driver and front passenger. This includes individual 
backrest width adjustment for optimum fit, and adjustable thigh 
support, seat heating with three settings as well as an adjustable 
lumbar support. Up to three personal settings can also be stored in 
Memory and accessed when required. 


Automatic Air Conditioning 

The IHKA system is installed in the M5 as standard equipment. 

Same as the production based 5 Series, minor adjustments can be 
made utilizing the iDrive menu for climate control. 

Central Information Display with Navigation 

Navigation is standard equipment on the M5 which includes the 
Top Hi-Fi (Logic7 ) audio system and the acclaimed iDrive system. 



M Multi-Function Seat (Optional) 

Backrest width adjustment system serves the purpose of optimally 
adapting the side sections of the backrest to the individual upper 
body of the occupants with the aim of achieving improved support 
of the upper body when cornering. 


BMW M GmbH has developed the 
active backrest width adjustment 
in M-vehicles for performance-ori¬ 
ented drivers. The active backrest 
width adjustment (ALBV) changes 
the setting of the side sections of 
the backrest dynamically when 
cornering. The dynamic setting of 
the backrest is dependent on vari¬ 
ous parameters.

Forces acting towards the outer edge of a bend result in centrifugal 
forces exerted on the upper body of the driver when driving through 
corners dynamically. The upper body is then displaced towards the 
outer edge of the bend. 

The active backrest width adjustment system activates the respec¬ 
tive side section of the backrest to counteract the forces and to 
keep the upper body stable in the seat. The driver can concentrate 
fully on steering the vehicle. 

System Components 
Drive Unit 

The drive unit consists of a DC motor with a step-down gear 
mechanism flanged to it. The gear mechanism engages in the 
adjustment assembly on which the side sections of the backrest 


are mounted. The side sections of the backrest are adjusted from 
maximum open (0%) to maximum closed (100%) by the adjust¬ 
ment assembly. 

An electric motor is driven by a PWM signal (pulse-width modula¬ 
tion) for this purpose. The adjustment speed can be influenced 
corresponding to the pulse width. At maximum closing speed, the 
side section of the backrest is adjusted from completely open 
(0%) to completely closed (100%) within approx. 1 second. 

The drive units are controlled with following pulse width correspon¬ 
ding to the characteristic curve. 

The drive unit uses various sensors to operate. The end position 
sensor (a two-wire Hall sensor) recognizes the fully opened back¬ 
rest width (0%).

Two Hall sensors (offset by 120 degrees) are additionally installed 
for determining the direction of rotation and position. The signals 
of the Hall sensors are counted up or down, enabling the ALBV 
control unit to determine the direction of rotation and position. The 
Hall sensors are monitored by the ALBV control unit and sampled 
every 200 ms. 

A temperature sensor is installed in the drive unit. At excessively 
high temperatures, the drive unit is no longer activated until the 
temperature has dropped below a permissible value. 


The active backrest width adjustment system consists of the 
following control units: 

• Active backrest width adjustment, driver (ALBV FA) 

• Active backrest width adjustment, front passenger (ALBV BF) 

Both control units are located in the respective driver's or front pas¬ 
senger's seat. The control units feature a PT-CAN bus link. This 
connection to the PT-CAN is necessary in view of the high number 
of parameters relating to the vehicle dynamics from the DSC and 
DME control unit and the short response time of the system.

Principles of Operation 
System Activation 

The active backrest width adjustment system cannot be activated 
before the engine is running. There are buttons for the driver's and 
front passenger's side located in the center console switch cluster 
(SZM) to switch on the system. 

A green LED lights when the button is pressed with the engine 
running. The indicator switches to two LEDs or three LEDs when 
the button is pressed again. 

The active backrest width adjustment system is switched off 
immediately if the button is pressed for longer than 1.2 seconds 
and all LEDs go out. 

Each of these LEDs represents a specific characteristic map that is 
stored in the ALBV FA / ALBV BF. 



The actuators for setting the side sections of the backrest are 
actuated corresponding to the selected characteristic map. The 
actuators are controlled by means of a PWM signal (pulse-width 
modulation). 

The ALBV system features the following functions: 

• Basic Function 

- Active backrest width adjustment 

• Additional Functions 

- Easy-entry for driver's and front passenger's side 

- Backrest width adjustment 

- Readjustment of the backrest width 

- Soft start/stop of the drive unit for backrest width adjustment 

- Backrest width memory function 

- Special features in M-Drive mode

Basic Function 

After activation of a corresponding characteristic curve (comfort, 
normal, sports) the outer (closest to the curve) side section of the 
backrest is controlled during vehicle operation depending on vari¬ 
ous parameters. 

The side sections of the backrest are adjusted to such an extent as 
to take up the transverse forces and to keep the position of the 
upper body stable in the seat. 

Various control units make available information on the PT-CAN to 
the ALBV control units for the purpose of controlling the respective 
side sections. The DSC control unit provides the most important 
information. 

The following information is made available: 

• Road Speed - The mean value of the signals of all four wheel 
speed sensors is determined and sent as the road speed 
signal on the PT-CAN. 

• Longitudinal and transverse acceleration - The longitudinal 
and transverse acceleration is calculated in the DSC control 
unit from the signals of the Y sensor 2. 

• Yaw Rate - The yaw rate, i.e. the rotation about the vertical 
axis, is also calculated in the DSC control unit from the signals 
of the Y sensor 2. 

• Steering Angle - The steering angle is determined by the 
steering angle sensor in the steering column switch cluster 
SZL. The SZL sends a data telegram via the F-CAN to the 
DSC control unit. 

• Steering Angle Speed - The steering angle speed is also 
determined by the steering angle sensor and sent via the SZL 
to the DSC control unit. 


Further information from the DME (ECM) and driver's/front 
passenger's seat modules: 

• Engine speed information - The DME sends an engine speed 
signal so that the ALBV control unit recognizes that the engine 
is running and the system can be activated. 

• Memory information - The backrest width memory is integrat¬ 
ed in the seat memory located in the respective driver's/front 
passenger's seat module. The seat module initiates the 
backrest width memory by means of a K-CAN telegram. 

Convenience Entry/Exit Aid 

To make it easier for the driver and passenger to get in and out of 
the vehicle the side sections of the backrest are completely 
opened (0%) and held in this position. 

The side sections of the driver's seat backrest are opened under 
the following conditions: 

• Terminal R OFF 

• Terminal R ON and driver's door opened 

• Driver's door open and terminal 15 OFF 

The side sections of the front passenger's seat backrest are 
opened under the following conditions: 

• The front passenger's door is opened and the seat belt not 
buckled. 

Note: The easy-entry facility is deactivated when the 

active backrest width adjustment is enabled, i.e. the 
engine is running and the side sections of the back¬ 
rest are in the position last stored. 



Backrest Width Adjustment 

The backrest width can be preset manually by means of a seat 
adjustment switch on the control panel. 

The customer has the option of setting the backrest width to 
his/her individual requirements. Adjustment is possible as from 
terminal 30. 

The switches for backrest width adjustment are connected via the 
K-bus to the center console switch cluster (SZM). The SZM is con¬ 
nected via the K-CAN to the KGM and the PT-CAN. 

After selecting a characteristic curve for the active backrest width 
adjustment, only the presetting between completely open (0%) 
and half closed (50%) is possible otherwise subsequent 
adjustment would no longer be possible if the side sections of the 
backrest were completely closed (100%). 

Only the open backrest side section can be adjusted during control 
of the active backrest width.

Readjustment of the Backrest Width 

Readjustment is intended to balance out the asymmetry in the side 
sections of the backrest after manual adjustment of the backrest 
width or after assuming a memory position. 

Readjustment takes place when the electronic circuitry in the ALBV 
control unit recognizes a difference of >5 Hall pulses between the 
left and right actuator motors. 

Readjustment takes place 1 second after the end of the backrest 
width adjustment procedure. If the adjustment was not successful, 
the procedure is repeated after 2 seconds. 

No readjustment takes place while the active backrest width adjust¬ 
ment is in operation. 

Soft Start/Stop of Drive Unit 

A special control facility is responsible for starting and stopping the 
electric motor. The controlled start function minimizes starting 
current peaks and avoids mechanical noise during the adjustment 
procedure. The controlled soft stop function prevents overrunning 
of the drive unit. 

Backrest Width Memory 

The backrest width memory is located in the respective driver's 
and passenger's seat module. With the aid of the memory buttons 
in the seat control panel, two positions can be stored for each per¬ 
sonalized key in the backrest width adjustment memory. 

The setting of the driver's seat last selected is additionally stored in 
the current key under following conditions: 

• 10 seconds after manual backrest width adjustment 

• When retrieving a memory position 

• When switching terminals from 15 to R M-Drive

M Complete Vehicles 


Initialization of the Drive Units 

An initialization procedure must be performed to ensure smooth 
operation after replacing a control unit or a drive unit. 

As part of this initialization procedure, the zero position of the drive 
units is defined by the signal from the end position sensors. For 
this purpose, the drives are moved to the fully opened position 
and the switch pressed and held for at least 15 seconds. 

Initialization can be performed with the aid of the BMW diagnosis 
system (Service functions => Body => Active backrest width 
adjustment). 

Rear Seats 

The rear seat have been modified slightly in order to improve seat 
positioning during hard cornering maneuvers. 


The M5 still boasts having split 60/40 rear seat backs for extra 
storage capability and an armrest with built in cup holders.

E63/E64 M6 


With the M6, BMW M GmbH presents the sports-oriented 6 
Series luxury coupe and Convertible. These vehicles share many 
features with the E60 M5 especially the powertrain. 

As on the E60 M5 the 5.0 liter, 10 cylinder S85 engine is installed. 
With an output of 500 hp and 383 Ib-ft of torque the engine is 
capable of revving beyond 8000 rpm. 

But power is not everything. What is more significant are the 
acceleration characteristics and the vehicle dynamics, which in 
turn depend, on the one hand, on the vehicle weight and, on the 
other hand, on the actual thrust at the drive wheels that is derived 
from the engine torque and the overall transmission ratio. 


The 7-speed SMG is the ideal gearbox for optimally transferring 
the power from the VI0 engine via the drivetrain to the rear 
wheels. Together with the excellent, uncompromising chassis with 
its sports oriented tuning, this power plant launches the BMW M6 
into the ranks of a super sports car. 

Yet, in contrast to its normally two-seater competitors, the M6 
offers the space and comfort of a typical 2+2 configuration, as 
well as the interior trim and equipment of a typical luxury class 
BMW.

Chassis and Suspension 

The chassis of the M6 differs from that of the M5 by a shorter 
wheelbase and an even lower center of gravity thus increasing 
agility. 

Electronic Damper Control (EDC) 

The electronic damper control system has been adopted from the 
E60 M5 and the software adapted to the E63/E64 M6. 

Traction Control System 

The DSC Mk60E5 system from the E60 M5 with the 
software configuration (adapted to the E63/E64 M6) is used. 

Front Axle Suspension 

The stabilizer bar on the front axle is designed as a tubular stabilizer 
bar and has been adapted to match the chassis tuning. The link, 
rubber mount and bracket have been adopted from the E60 M5. 
Due to the design of the front axle, there are sections with different 
outside and inside diameters. 

The spring strut corresponds to that of the E60 M5 but the spring 
plates have been adapted to the E63/E64 M6 in terms of the 
kinematic requirements as well as spring tuning and length. 

The geometry of the cylindrical coil spring is the same as on the 
E39 M5. The spring plate and top spring mount are identical to 
those on the E46 M3. 


Front Axle Mounting 

The thrust panel on the front axle is a common part with the E60 
M5 and is made from aluminum. 

The material thickness is 2.5 mm on the E63 645i and 3.5 mm on 
the E63/E64 M6. 

The control arms are the same as installed on the E63 645i but 
fitted with rubber mounts from the E61. 

The heat shield panels on the left and right of the front axle carrier 
have been adapted to the S85B50 engine. 

Wheel Bearings 

Apart from the camber modification, the swivel bearing is a 
common part with the E63 645i. 

Negative camber E63 645i: 12 min 
Negative camber E63 M6: 60 min (1°). 

Rear Axle Suspension 

The spring strut and the shock absorbers correspond to those on 
the E60 M5, however, they have been adapted in terms of tuning 
and length. 

The springs together with the mounting assembly and stabilizer bar 
are the same as on the E60 M5 but adapted to the specific 
requirements of the E63 M6. 

Final Drive 

The final drive unit is the same as the M-limited slip differential of 
the E60 M5. 

Gear ratio E63 M6:1 = 1:3.62 = 47:13 teeth 
Basic model E63 645i: I = 1:3.46.

Electrical System 

Wiring Harness 

The main wiring harness is new. It is designed as a one-piece, 
modular structure specific to the equipment configuration. 


The MOST system is integral. The wiring to the hood lock is new - 
necessary with SMG. 

Brakes 

Brake Operation (hydraulic system) 

The brake system is the same as on the E60 M5 but specifically 
adapted to the E63 M6. 

Electric Vacuum Pump 

The assistance of an external vacuum pump is required under 
various operating conditions (e.g. race track mode, driving off with 
the engine cold or rolling at terminal 15 with the engine not turned 
on) to ensure sufficient vacuum in the brake booster at all times. 

An electric vacuum pump has been installed with the introduction 
of the E63E64 M6. It is installed on the left in the engine compart¬ 
ment under the left microfilter for the heating/air conditioning 
system. This vacuum pump is also installed with the series launch 
of the E60 M5. 


The electric vacuum pump is actuated by the DME (digital motor 
electronics) MS_S65. For more information refer to the M engine 
Management System section of this training material.

Body 

Apart from the carbon roof, front and rear bumpers as well as the 
left and right side sill panels, the body corresponds to that of the 
basic E63 645i. 

The outside mirrors are the same as on the E60 M5. 

Changes to the body: 

• Roof 

• Front bumper 

• Rear bumper 

• Left/right sill panel 

Roof 

As already used on the E46 M3 CSL in other markets of the world, 
the E63 M6 (Coupe) features a visible carbon fiber reinforced 
plastic (CFK) outer roof skin panel. 



The carbon fiber-reinforced plastic roof is 7 kg lighter than the stan¬ 
dard steel roof therefore lowers the vehicle's center of gravity. This 
has a particularly positive effect on the vehicle dynamics. 

Minor scratches can be painted. The roof must be replaced in the 
event of more extensive damage (e.g. a hole). The carbon fiber- 
reinforced plastic roof is bonded to the body (see Repair 
Instructions No. 41 31 000). 

Note: The panoramic roof option SA is not available. 

Front Bumper 

The front bumper is designed as a lightweight bumper. 

It has its own distinctive appearance and is aerodynamically opti¬ 
mized. The design specifically takes into account the brake cooling 
function and the air intake for the VI0 engine. 

It consists of: 

• Advanced composite plastic carrier with deformation element 
(a glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFK) braiding as replacement 
for the standard, heavier aluminum section) 

• Shock absorber (foam material) 

• Plastic paneling (material same as on the E63 basic vehicle) 

• No body molding 


Note: The fog light and ACC (active cruise control) options 
are not available.

E9XM3 


M3 is a simple letter and number combination which has become 
synonymous with an extremely powerful and dynamic perform¬ 
ance car. 

The M3 is now in its fourth generation with a history of success in 
the world of motorsport, winning races across the globe since its 
beginning back in 1985. Not only has the race version of the M3 
gained a successful motorsports heritage, its own road credentials 
live up to the expectations and demands of today’s M3 drivers. 
The E92 M3 was launched in the spring of 2008. (The E90 sedan 
and E93 Convertible followed soon after). 



This precisely balanced sports car set new benchmarks in driving 
dynamics for sport coupes. As with its predecessor the focus has 
been on optimizing the power to weight ratio while maintaining the 
high engine speed concept. This combination ensures that both 
power and driving agility are exceptional, placing the M3 in an 
even higher level of sport car competition.

Body 

In addition to the sporty and dynamic appearance of the external 
design, the main features are weight optimization and a reinforced 
bodyshell for improved dynamic handling. A further outstanding 
feature of the E92 M3 is the sophisticated aerodynamics typical of 
the M series. 

The doors and the trunk lid are taken from the series-model E92. 
All other external body components of the Coupe are new (shown 
here in blue). 



View of M3-specific external body components 


Hood 

A New "Powerdome" aluminum hood with air opening is intro¬ 
duced. The air intake on the left (when viewed in the direction of 
travel) is a fresh air intake for the engine. The right-side aperture is 
closed and is only for optical symmetry.

Roof 

The roof on the E92 M3 is manufactured from carbon fiber. This 
has reduced the overall vehicle mass on the upper level of the car 
by approximately 5 kg, therefore considerably lowering the center of 
gravity. 

A roof rack system can be assembled on the E92 M3 with carbon 
fiber roof. The roof has specific inserts for roof luggage rack brack¬ 
ets. 

The repair procedures and options are similar to or the same as the 
M6. 



If the sunroof option is selected, a steel roof similar to the series 
model E92 is fitted. 


Side Sills 

The side sills are more highly accentuated, in accordance with the 
M design criteria. 



Exterior RearView Mirrors 

The ’M’ designed exterior door mirrors have an optimized airflow 
design. The mirror surface area is larger to comply with future legis¬ 
lation. The mirror base mounting has been adapted to suit the new 
mirror unit. 

The functions of the outside mirrors are the same as the series 
production E92. Driver and passenger mirrors are electrically heat¬ 
ed and adjusted. 

The cover cap of the exterior mirror housing is painted in the body 
color.

The front section module has a single piece M-specific thermo¬ 
plastic bumper trim and is fitted to a reinforced lightweight plastic 
bracket. The bumper trim is color coded to the car. 

The front M3 bumper has openings for the kidney grill, engine air 
inlet, PDC ultrasonic sensors (optional), the headlight-cleaning sys¬ 
tem and the mounting for the towing eye (hook). 



Front bi-xenon headlamp units are identical to the series E92. The 
M3 front bumper overhang is longer than that of the series E92. 

Rear Bumper 

The rear section module also features an M style single-piece 
bumper trim made from thermoplastic material. The bracket is also 
made from reinforced lightweight plastic.

M- Specific Equipment 

Exterior: Front apron with generous air inlets, "Powerdome" 

engine hood with air inlet, carbon fiber roof, functional 
side gills, outside mirrors, sporty rocker covers, extended 
wheel arches, new wheel rim design, rear spoiler and 
four exhaust tailpipes all combine to provide the initial 
impression that this is an M vehicle. 

Interior: Sill trim strips, seats, steering wheel, instrument cluster, 

switches in the center console and the gear lever design 
all increase the anticipation. 


S65B40 Engine 

For the first time in a production M3 a V8-power plant used. The 
Formula 1 inspired S65B40 is designed for high-speed operation 
and extreme reliability. 

With eight individual throttle plates, generous intake air and exhaust 
manifolds, and many more refined M-specific features such as the 
MSS60 engine control, the S65B40 is once again an outstanding 
highlight of the M Series. 

Note: For further information on the S65B40 engine refer to

The vehicle is available with the double-disc clutch and 6-gear 
manual transmission or with the M-DCT Double-Clutch Trans¬ 
mission coupled to the fully variable M limited-slip differential (See 
Drivetrain section of this training material for further information). 

Chassis and Suspension 

Front and rear axles with enhanced suspension geometry and 
M-specific suspension settings with 18" tires. 

Specific objectives of the development were weight optimization, 
and in particular, control of the longitudinal and lateral accelera- 
tion/power that is generated when enjoying the pleasure of driving 
the M3. 


The electrical equipment and bus structure of the M3 are based 
on the E92 series vehicle. 

The optional MDrive menu can be used to preset and configure 
the standard Servotronic and the M engine dynamics control 
(enhanced with "Sport Plus"), the optional electronic damper 
control EDC-Kand the DSC M dynamic mode. 

In the E9x Series, the BMW Individual High End audio system 
is offered for the first time in the M3. 

Note: The vehicle electrical system is based on the E92 
series production vehicle system and has been 
adapted for the M3. 




The M3 brake system has compound brake rotors with high-per¬ 
formance brake pads and standard M series ABS/DSC to guaran¬ 
tee optimum braking efficiency and active safety.
