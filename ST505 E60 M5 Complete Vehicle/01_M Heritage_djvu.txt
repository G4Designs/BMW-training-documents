M Heritage 


Since 1972, BMW M GmbH, the “Motorsport” division of BMW 
has been turning out some of the most powerful and legendary 
engine packages in the auto industry.

E26M1 


The Ml is a mid-engine race car that was produced by BMW. 

A production version was introduced to the public as the E26 Ml 
coupe and was hand-built under the Motorsport division. 

The vehicle was built (in limited production) from 1978 to 1981. 



The Ml’s engine has a displacement of 3.5L and was designated 
the M88. It is configured as a straight six and uses twin overhead 
cams, four valves per cylinder, and six individual throttle bodies 
with mechanical fuel injection. 

Although the M88 propelled the Ml to a top speed of 165 mph 
and developed 277 hp in the production vehicle, turbocharged 
racing versions of the vehicle produced well in excess of 800hp. 

The production version of the M88, the S38 was later installed in 
other BMW vehicles such as the E24 M6 and E28 M5. (See the 
Engine Section of this training material for more information.)

M5 Models 


E28 M5 

Based on the E28 5 Series and hand built in Dingolfing, this M5 
was the first car to combine the everyday usability of a sedan with 
the performance of a sports car. At its introduction the first M5 
was not only the fastest sedan at the time but also heralded the 
birth of a whole new segment.

E34M5 

The successor to the E28 came with one of the most powerful 
straight-six engines ever built by BMW. The exterior appearance 
was more individual with muscular front and rear aprons, contrast¬ 
ing side skirts and a unique wheel design. The E34 M5 far 
exceeded the sales figures of its predecessor.

Note: US version had 30 bhp less compared with the 
European due to the changes that allowed it to 
run on unleaded fuel with a catalytic converter. 



























E39 M5 


The E39 M5 effortlessly combined the concept of a luxury saloon 
with sports car technology and in so doing, attained the unanimous 
respect of enthusiasts and journalists. With the launch of E39, the 
traditionally understated appearance became more athletic and 
confident. The addition of muscular front and rear aprons coupled 
with more pronounced side skirts and 18-inch wheels served to 
reinforce the M5’s sporty intentions. The E39 M5 was also the 
second M model to receive the now trademark M four-tailpipes 
(M Roadster was the first).

E60 M5 


The E60 M5 was introduced in October 2005 in the US market. 

It is currently the most powerful M5 of all time and the first to 
exhibit this power potential at first glance. 

Prominent front and rear aprons, paired with side sills and a power¬ 
ful rear spoiler clearly distinguish the M5 from the E60 Series. 

A rear diffuser provides an additional power boost on the rear axle. 

The VI0 engine was derived from BMW-Williams Formula 1 
engine. The S85 is an all-aluminum naturally-aspirated engine with 
5.0L displacement that can rev up to 8,250 rpm and develop 400 
bhp. This output can be increased to 500 bhp by pressing the 
power button on the center console.

M6 Vehicles 

E24 M6 

The E24 M6 was introduced in 1987 as a 2 door coupe. 

It was equipped with the S38 six cylinder engine which produced 
286 hp and had a top speed of 155mph (approximately). The M6 
was available for only two years.

E63/E64 M6 


BMW has been crafting sleek and fast coupes since 1936, but 
more strictly speaking the M6’s heritage encompasses just four 
predecessors. The 3.0 CSL, the Ml, a first-generation M6 and 
the 850CSi. All, to one degree or another, were products of BMW 
M, or BMW Motorsport as it was originally called. 

Using much of the technology from the E60 M5, BMW E63/E64 
M6 continues the proud tradition of performance coupes.

M3 Vehicles 


E30 M3 

Produced between 1988 - 1991, the first M3 generation turned 
the world of racing upside down. One year prior, the M3 had been 
launched as a thoroughbred sports car for the road. 

Powered by a four-cylinder four-valve engine, the original M3 
showed its sporting ambitions in its exterior design. The flared 
wheel arches and a large rear spoiler gave it lots of road presence. 



E36 M3 

Produced in two versions the first ini 995 and the later between 
1996-2000. The second-generation M3 was offered as a com¬ 
plete model series. 

First came the Coupe and two years later the Convertible and 
Sedan. And the engine received a nice boost, too: The four-valve 
six-cylinder engine delivered 240 hp.

Produced between 2001 and 2006, the third generation of the M3 
enters the stage with the M3 Coupe and the high-rewing naturally 
aspirated engine delivering 333 hp at up to 8,000 rpm. 

BMW once more introduced a true sports car, which, like its prede¬ 
cessor, was crowned “best handling car”. From 2001, BMW added 
the convertible version.

Introduced in 2007, the current BMW M3 has a new naturally aspi¬ 
rated V8 engine, suspension and drivetrain, a convincing design 
and best-in-class performance, the latest generation of the BMW 
M3 is once again making headlines. As with all M vehicles, BMW 
delivers a true sports car with fantastic everyday usability. The new 
BMW M3 is currently available across the E9X model line up. It can 
be ordered as E92 Coupe, E90 Sedan or as a Convertible with the 
E93. This M3 features the successor of SMG III the M-DCT

M Roadsters and Coupes 


Two generations of the M Coupe have been manufactured; one 
based on the E36/8 Z3 Coupe and the second on the E86 Z4 
Coupe. Both available also in M Roadster form. 

The first generation E36/8, the Z3 Coupe (1998 - 2002) com¬ 
bined an M coupe body design with the standard Z3 drivetrain, 
chassis and cosmetics. M Coupes built between 1998 and 2000 
were fitted with the same engines used in the 1996 to 1999 
BMW E36 M3. 

The US models were fitted with the S52, a 240hp and 319 Nm 
(236 lb ft) 3.2 liter in-line 6 cylinder engine. In 2001, the M Coupe 
was reintroduced with the 3.2 liter S54 engine from the E46 M3. 
In M Coupe form it produced (333hp) and 355 Nm (262 Ib.ft) of 
torque. 



The BMW M Roadster was designed to be the performance ver¬ 
sion of the BMW Z3, and there were significant differences 
between the two variants. The body of the M Roadster had many 
slight differences, including front and rear bumpers, side gills, rear 
fenders, trunk, and mirrors. 

Based on the E36 platform, the Z3 Roadster was designated 
E36/7. Many of the components were taken from the E30 and 
E36 M3 including the brakes and much of the suspension. 

The limited slip differential, a different gearbox, and strengthening 
of the chassis, set the vehicle apart from the series production 
model.

M Roadster 

The Z4 M Roadster was produced from 2006 to 2008. Although 
the basic concept and proportions are identical to those of the 
E85 LCI, the Z4 M Roadster differs considerably, not only in terms 
of performance. Some striking features include the precision lines 
of the hood as well as the front apron with large air inlets. 

The Z4 M Roadster is equipped with the speed-sensitive variable 
differential lock as known from the E46 M3. The vehicle is 
equipped with a 6-speed manual gearbox with typical short shift 
paths (standard). An automatic gearbox was not be offered. 


M Coupe 

As the M Roadster the Z4 M Coupe was introduced to the market 
in 2006 and was produced until 2008. 

BMW released a limited production of the second generation 
M Coupe referred to as E86. 

The redesigned M Coupe is also based on the Z4. It uses the 
S54, 3.2 liter inline 6 cylinder engine (same as the E46 M3) pro¬ 
ducing 333 hp. It shares many components with the Z4 Roadster 
and with the E46 M3.

M xDrive Vehicles 


E70X5 M and E71 X6 M 

The BMW X5 M and the BMW X6 M are the first all-wheel-drive 
models to offer the M performance while combining dynamic driv¬ 
ing experience and sporty design. 

Both vehicles are powered by a newly-developed 4.4-liter V8 M 
engine delivering 555 hp at 6,000 rpm. 

These vehicles accelerate to 60 mph from a standstill in 4.5 sec¬ 
onds. The V8 twin-turbo engine provides a maximum torque of 
500 Ib-ftfrom 1,500 rpm. 



The S63 engine is the world’s first engine with a pulse-tuned 
exhaust manifold combined with high-performance twin-scroll 
twin turbo technology. 

BMW M engineers pushed the capabilities of xDrive and the 
Dynamic Performance Control system to manage the power 
and performance potential of these two new vehicles. 

Thanks to careful tuning of xDrive, Dynamic Performance Control, 
and Dynamic Stability Control with M Dynamic Mode the X6 M 
and X5 M achieve maximum control over extreme cornering forces 
in all driving conditions.
