E60 S85 - The New M5 


Foreword 

The new BMW M5 will be launched in 
October 2004. It will be the most powerful M5 
of all time and the first to exhibit this power 
potential at first glance. 

The basic concept, however, remains 
unchanged: The E60 M5 too combines - 
without compromise - the qualities of a luxury 
class Saloon with the power potential of a 
sports car. Its visual appearance, however, is 
intentionally somewhat less discreet as its 
predecessor. The front and rear aprons are 
now slightly more prominent and, together 
with the rear spoiler, 4-pipe exhaust system 
and 19" wheels, the in the meantime MS- 


characteristic side gills unmistakably identify 
the M5 at first glance - even from the side. 

The highlight of the new M5 is, of course, the 
VI0 engine derived from BMW-Williams 
Formula 1. With the governed limit at 
8,250 rpm, it not only provides Formula 1 
performance but also develops that typical 
Formula 1 sound. 

Despite these features, the M5 still remains an 
understatement-product. Its exterior conveys 
a powerful yet still reserved appearance. At no 
point has its everyday suitability gained from 
the E60 series been lost.

The most important features in brief 


10-cylinder Formula 1 engine 



The VI0 all-aluminium naturally-aspirated 
engine with 5 I displacement develops 
400 bhp output. This output can be increased 
to over 500 bhp by pressing the power button 
on the centre console. 

As in the Formula 1, the bedplate structure 
ensures low-vibration stability with matching 
rigidity. The engine is controlled by the 
Siemens MS_S65 engine management while 
the knock control is based on ionic current 
technology. 

The 2-disc dry clutch also stems from 
Formula 1, while the gears are shifted with a 7- 
speed SMG 3 gearbox specifically adapted to 
the high speed concept. 

Despite these impressive performance data, 
the E60 M5 conforms to the exhaust emission 
standard EU4. 


Body and suspension 

Prominent front and rear aprons, paired with 
side sills and a powerful rear spoiler clearly 
distinguish the M5 from the E60 Series. A rear 
diffuser - also a Formula 1 offshoot - provides 
an additional power boost on the rear axle. 

With the push of a button, the new DSC on the 
M5 provides substantially greater lateral force 
for fans of the controlled drift. The rear axle 
lock is not fixed at 25% but rather provides 
variable control. 


Control and individualization 



The buttons on the shift lever can be used to 
vary the performance control systems. The 
accelerator pedal characteristic, EDC and 
Servotronic can be individually configured and 
selected by means of M-buttons on the 
steering wheel. The head-up display is 
specifically adapted to the M5 environment.

Purpose of this Participant's Manual 


The Participant's Manual is a document 
designed to accompany a seminar while at the 
same time serving as a source of reference. 


This Participant's Manual describes new 
features and further developments of the 
S85B50 engine.

Introduction 

S85B50 Engine 


Introduction 


The S85B50 is the first 10-cylinder engine 
from BMW for series production vehicles. The 
high speed layout of the S85 is a guarantee for 
a high degree of spontaneity in engine 
response and uniform power development. 
Due to the, for an in-line engine, very high top 
engine speed of 8,250 rpm, an extremely rigid 
engine block is necessary in order to 
withstand the vibrations and to satisfy the 
acoustic requirements. 

For this reason, a bedplate structure was 
chosen for the engine block. The cylinder 
head is also designed as a one-piece unit in 
order to achieve the greatest possible rigidity 
and to reduce sealing surfaces. 


The valve train especially the box-type tappets 
with hydraulic lash adjusters (HVA) have been 
optimized with regard to weight and friction. 

The high dynamics and spontaneity of the 
engine render necessary extremely fast 
adjustment of the VANOS. This is achieved by 
an oil pressure of 115 bar as well as new 
proportional valves and VANOS gear 
mechanisms. 

The rapid engine response also necessitates 
the use of individual throttle valves that are 
operated side-specific. 

The S85 is equipped with a double-disc clutch 
and dual-mass flywheel (ZMS) in order to 
transmit the high power to the transmission.

S85B50 


Engine block with bedplate 



1 - Crankcase with bedplate (grey = aluminium, dark grey = cast iron, blue = water area, yellow = oil area) 


The lower bearings of the crankshaft in 
conventional crankcases are designed as 
individual bearing bridges. 

In order to reliably take up the piston forces, 
these "main bearing bridges" are made of cast 
iron. 

The bearing bridges are cast and are 
machined together with the crankcase 
following initial assembly. 

In the case of the bedplate-type crankcase, 
the crankcase is split at the level of the 
crankshaft into the upper section of the 
crankcase and lower section of the crankcase, 
i.e. the bedplate. 

In the split crankcase with bedplate, the 
crankshaft bearings are an integral part of a 
separate, stable frame, i.e. the bedplate. 

The bedplate is machined together with the 
crankcase and, after assembling the 
crankshaft, mounted to the upper section of 
the crankcase. 


Features 

• The crankcase is additionally stiffened 
towards the oil pan by the complete 
bedplate. Consequently, the entire engine 
is on the whole more rigid and more 
resistant to torsion. 

• The additional rigidity of the crankcase also 
improves the engine acoustics. 

• The bedplate makes it possible to 
accommodate additional assemblies in the 
lower section of the engine. 

• The bedplate facilitates simple and fast 
assembly of the crankshaft main bearings. 


T004-4563 














Bedplate screw connection 



2 - Bedplate screw connection 


The bedplate is secured to the upper section 
of the crankcase with the main bearing bolts. 
The positions are fixed with fitted sleeves 
(NG4) or screws with adapter sleeves (S85). 
The engine serial number is punched on the 
bedplate (see arrow). 

To ensure trouble-free operation of the 
crankshaft, it is essential that the specified 
sequence of the bedplate screw connections 
is adhered to. Any deviations from this 
sequence can result in engine damage and 
leaks in the bedplate/crankcase. 

The bedplate facilitates simple and fast 
assembly of the crankshaft main bearings. 

The bedplate must be sealed from the 
crankcase. Since the crankshaft bore is 
produced together with the bolted bedplate, a 
flat gasket cannot be used otherwise the 
crankshaft bore would be enlarged. For this 
reason, bedplate-type engines are sealed with 
a liquid sealing compound in a groove. 



3 - Injection opening in crankcase for liquid sealant 


After completely bolting the bedplate to the 
crankcase, the liquid sealant is injected via 
injection nozzles into the groove. 






















Bedplate sealing 


Primer is used to harden the liquid sealant at 
the outlet points. 



4 - Sealant outlet 


Crankshaft drive 



The forged crankshaft has a crank pin 
sequence of 72°. The sprocket for the primary 
timing gear is produced as one part together 
with the crankshaft. 

Both the pistons as well as the steel cracked 
connecting rods are asymmetric. 


5 - Crankshaft with connecting rods and pistons 







Cylinder head 



6 - Cross section of cylinder head (red = cut edge, orange = secondary air 
channel, blue = water area, agua = idle air port) 


The one-piece design of the cylinder head 
offers advantages with regard to rigidity and a 
reduction in sealing surfaces. 

Both the idle air port as well as the secondary 
air channel are integrated in the cylinder head. 


Timing gear 



7- Timing gear S85 


A timing chain with separate chain tensioner 
drives each intake camshaft (primary timing 
gear). A toothed drive belt provides the drive 
from the intake camshaft to the exhaust 
camshaft (secondary timing gear). 



8 - Valve train 


For weight and friction reasons, the shape of 
the hydraulic tappets in the S85 is based on 
the box-type tappet as known from motor 
racing engines. Since the tappets must not 
rotate in the cylinder head, anti-torsion 
needles which run in grooves milled into the 
cylinder head are fitted in the tappets. 


T004-5251 



VANOS 



9 - VANOS control unit 


As known from the S62, the VANOS system is 
used on the S85 to adjust both the intake 
camshaft as well as the exhaust camshaft. The 
intake camshafts have an adjustment range of 
60° crankshaft angle and the exhaust 
camshafts 37° crankshaft angle. 


The oil pressure of 115 bar is produced by a 
high pressure pump installed in the oil pan. 
The high pressure pump is driven through a 
gearwheel directly from the crankshaft. 

The pressurized engine oil is routed via two 
delivery lines to the two VANOS control units 
and to the pressure accumulator. 

The adjustment units feature two proportional 
valves that ensure infinitely variable control of 
the oil pressure. Compared to the directional 
control valves used formerly, proportional 
valves ensure shorter control times and 
greater operational reliability.

Cooling circuit 



14- Cooling circuit 

Coolant flows both through the cylinder head 
as well as the engine block in the familiar 
cross-flow manner. A new feature, however, is 
that each cylinder head has its own radiator 
feed and the thermostat is located in the 
return flow line. The radiator is divided into an 
upper and lower water tank. Coolant that 
emerges from the cylinder head 1 - 5 flows 
through the upper water tank. The coolant 
from cylinder head 6-10 flows through the 
lower water tank. 


The split cooler makes it necessary to provide 
three bleeder openings and two bleeder lines 
to ensure effective self-bleeding of the 
system. 

The tap-off point for the heating system heat 
exchanger is located at the rear of the cylinder 
heads. The heating return line and the line to 
the expansion tank merge together at a T- 
piece ahead of the water pump. 


TO04-4718 








Oil circuit lubrication 



15- S85 Oil circuit 

The S85 is equipped with a quasi-dry sump. 
For this reason, a suction pump is used to 
pump the oil out of the oil pan in the area 
ahead of the rack and pinion power steering 
gear into the rear oil sump. From here, a 
controllable slide valve pump conveys the oil 
at a max. pressure of 5 bar into the oil filter. A 
thermostat that enables the path to the engine 
cooler is additionally located in the oil filter 
head. The oil is then routed from the oil filter 
into the engine. Here it is divided over three 
lines to the two cylinder heads and to the 
crankcase. A special feature of this system are 
the two electrically driven oil pumps that are 
located on the left and right of the oil pan. 


The electric oil pumps start up at a transverse 
acceleration of 0.8 G and pump the oil from 
the cylinder heads which, under these 
centrifugal force conditions, would otherwise 
no longer flow back into the oil pan. 

The crankcase is ventilated by a cyclone 
separator in the intake air manifold 6-10. The 
return flow line from the oil separator and the 
condensation return flow lines from the intake 
air manifolds are routed along the 6 -10 side 
of the crankcase into the oil sump. 


T004-4593 




Intake air manifold 



16- Intake air manifolds S85 

The S85 is equipped with a separate intake air 
manifold for each cylinder bank. The intake air 
manifolds are connected via hoses to the 
throttle valve assemblies. 



10 individual throttle valves control the air 
supply for the S85. The individual throttle 
valves of each cylinder bank are operated 
separately by an actuator unit and operating 
shaft. The actuator motors operate 
independently. 


17 - S85 Throttle valves 

The throttle valves are set with respect to each 
other (as on S54). There are no facilities for the 
synchronization of the cylinder banks with 
respect to each other as well as for setting the 
full load stop. The necessary corrections are 
undertaken by the engine management (see 
section entitled Engine Management 
MS_S65). 


Idle control system 



The idle speed is controlled by two idle speed 
actuators that route the intake air from the 
intake air manifolds directly into the idle air port 
of the respective cylinder head. Each cylinder 
bank is controlled individually. 


18 - Idle control system 


TO04-5258 






Secondary air system 



19- Secondary air system 


The secondary air is injected into the exhaust 
ports via vacuum-controlled diaphragm valves 
on the cylinder heads. 

The vacuum necessary for activation of the 
secondary air valves is taken from the cylinder 
head 6 -10 and switched by an electric 
changeover valve. A check valve prevents the 
return into the cylinder head. 

The vacuum lines from the electric 
changeover valve to the secondary air valves 
are routed in the wiring harness duct.

Secondary air pump 


After the engine has been started, the electric 
secondary air pump mixes fresh air with the 
exhaust gas to bring about oxidation of the 
uncombusted hydrocarbons in the exhaust 
gas. As a result, the HC component in the 
exhaust gas is reduced and the light-off 
temperature of the near-engine main catalytic 
converters is reached at a faster rate. To 
conform to the stringent exhaust emission 
regulations in the USA, it is necessary to 
control the secondary air. This is achieved by 
an idle speed actuator in the secondary air line 
on the US version of the S85.

System components 
S85B50 Engine 


Basic engine and add-on parts 


Upper section of crankcase 

The upper section of the crankcase is made cylinders are machined in accordance with the 

from an aluminium alloy (GK Al- Alusil process. 

Sil 7Cu4Mg T5). The contact surfaces of the 


Bedplate 


The bedplate consists of an aluminium frame 
(G AISi7Mg0.3 T6) in which the grey cast iron 
bearing bridges (GGG 60) are cast. After 
casting, the component is subject to stress- 


relief annealing for 8 hours at a temperature of 
525 °C, it is then quenched in water at 70 °C 
and aged for 5 hours at a temperature of 
165 °C. 


Crankcase 

The crankcase comprises the bedplate and 
upper section of the crankcase. As already 
used on the N42, the seal is provided by a 
liquid sealant in a groove that is milled into the 
upper section of the crankcase. 

It is important that the assembly sequence is 
followed precisely in order to avoid stress in 
the crankcase when assembling the upper 
section and base plate: 

1. Position the bedplate diagonally on the 
bearing blocks 1 and 6 by means of two 
M8x94 screws. 


2. Provisionally fasten the bedplate with the 
ten M8x94 screws. 

3. Tighten the Ml 1x115 bolts to setting 
torque 

4. Tighten the Ml 1x115 bolts to specified 
rotary angle 

5. Tighten the M8x94 bolts to setting torque 

6. Tighten the M8x94 bolts to specified 
torque 

7. Tighten the M8x60, M8x35 and M8x25 
bolts to the specified torque 


Cylinder head 

The cylinder head is made from an aluminium 
alloy (GK AISiMgCu0.5 wa). 



Crankshaft/main bearings 

The crankshaft is forged from a high-strength 
steel 42CrMo4 and weighs 21.63 kg. After 
grinding the bearing points, the shaft is 
nitrocarburized. 

The colour codes of the main bearing shells 
are stamped on the crank web of the first main 
bearing. 


1 - Main bearing classification (G = green; Y = yellow; V = violet) 



Connecting rods 

The forged connecting rods of the S65 are 
made from the material 70MnVS4 BY. As on 
the S65, the large connecting rod eye of the 
connecting rods used on the S85 is cracked, 
thus achieving an unmistakable parting joint 
with outstanding fit accuracy. As on the NG 
engines, the small connecting rod eye is 
trapezoidal, enabling it to support the force 
over a large area. The connecting rods weigh 
582 g and are produced to a tolerance of + 

2 g. No classification is necessary in view of 
this very close tolerance range. When 
assembling the connecting rods and pistons it 
is important to bear in mind that the 
connecting rod is asymmetrical and, in the 
same way as the piston, must be specifically 
installed with respect to forward direction. 

The one-sided reduction of the thrust collar by 
1.5 mm per connecting rod serves the 
purpose of shortening the lateral offset by a 
total of 3 mm and therefore reducing the total 
length of the engine by 3 mm. The installation 
direction is indicated by two elevations on the 
connecting rod.

C\J 

in 

■ 

o 


The specified tightening operation for the 
connecting rod bolts must be adhered to 
precisely. Tightening the bolts three times to 
the same tightening angle gives rise to a 
certain training effect (work hardening) in the 
connecting rod bolts, resulting in increased 
pretensioning force and simultaneously in 
pretensioning force spread. Disregard of or a 
mix-up in the bolt tightening instructions can 
lead to 100 % engine damage by connecting 
rod bolts working loose. 


Pistons 


The piston is cast from aluminium 
(Al Sil 2CuNiMg). Since an aluminium piston 
is an unfavourable friction partner for an 
aluminium cylinder, the piston skirt is coated 

with a galvanic ferrous layer (Ferrostan) at a 
layer thickness of approx. 10 pm. An additional 
approx. 2 pm tin layer serves as a running-in 
layer. 

Camshaft 


The camshaft mounted in nine bearings is a 
hollow chill casting (GGG 60). For the first 
time, the wheel for the camshaft sensor is cast 
on the camshaft on the S85. An M12x1 thread 

is integrated in the camshafts for the central 
screw connection of the VANOS gear 
mechanism. 

Valve springs 


Conical valve springs are used on the S85. 

The same springs are used for the intake and 
exhaust. 



Valve cotters 


The valve cotters are designed as single-row 
clamping-type cone cotters. In contrast to the 
three-row valve cotters, these clamping-type 
cone cotters prevent the valve turning during 
operation as neither a cleaning effect nor 
running-in is necessary thanks to the clean 
and efficient combustion and the very close 
production tolerances. An advantage of the 
clamping-type cone cotters is their low weight 
(approx. 50 % lighter than the three-row valve 
cotters). 


In addition, the force of the valve spring is not 
transmitted positively but rather non-positively 
via the grooves in the valve stem. At a stem 
diameter of 5 mm, this arrangement protects 
the material more effectively. 







Box-type tappets 

Compared to bucket tappets, box-type 
tappets permit a substantially greater crown 
curvature, resulting in decreased migration of 
the cam and tappet contact point. An 
alternative is concave grinding of the cams. 
This, however, involves higher production 
expenditure and produces a bucket tappet 
with a considerably larger diameter and 


therefore an additional weight of approx. 20 g 
per tappet. The valve timing gear of the S54 is 
still unsurpassed with regard to the moved 
masses, however, the box-type tappet of the 
S85 represents an optimum solution in terms 
of conflicting objectives such as ease of 
servicing, production engineering and moved 
masses. 


Valves 

Both the exhaust valve as well as the intake 
valve are designed as solid stem valves with a 
stem diameter of 5 mm. The intake valves are 
made from the valve steel X45CrSi9-3. The 
exhaust valve stem is also made from 
X45CrSi9-3 and is friction-welded to the valve 
head made from NiCr20TiAI. 


To improve the cylinder charge, the standard 
cylindrical runout is not formed on the exhaust 
valve in the area of the valve seat but rather the 
70° bevel has a pointed runout. For this 
reason, the intake valve should be handled 
with great care as any "knock" could inevitably 
cause damage to the edges. 


VANOS High pressure pump 



4 - VANOS High pressure 
pump 


The high pressure pump is designed as a 
radial piston pump with five pump plungers. It 
is driven via a gear mechanism directly by the 
crankshaft. To avoid gearing noise, when 
mounting the sprocket of the high pressure 
pump, the coated part must face towards the 
crankshaft without any clearance. The correct 
gear clearance is then established 
automatically by the coating scraping off. 



The high pressure pump receives it oil supply 
from the bedplate. An 80 p.m fine filter is 
installed in the transition hole from the 
bedplate to the high pressure pump. This filter 
has the sole purpose of holding back any 
impurities that may accumulate during series 
production and is not replaced during vehicle 
operation. 


A feed valve in the high pressure pump 
ensures a constant supply of oil over the entire 
pressurized engine oil range.

The pressure relief valve integrated in the high

peaks in the high pressure system and opens 
up a bypass to the oil pan. 

The oil pressurized at 115 bar is routed via 
three delivery lines to the two VANOS control 
units and to the pressure accumulator.

Separate adjustment units are provided for 
each cylinder bank for the purpose of 
adjusting the VANOS gear mechanism. These 
adjustment units are known as the actuators. 
The VANOS high pressure pump supplies 
them with oil under high pressure. 

Since, due to the gearwheel connection the 
intake camshaft and exhaust camshaft rotate 
in opposing directions, the intake is adjusted 
towards advance and the exhaust towards 
retard when the plunger extends. 

The adjustment pistons are designed as 
double-acting cylinders and differ with regard 
to the adjustment range for the intake and 
exhaust camshafts. 



10 - Stroke of adjustment piston 


Index Explanation 

1 Stroke 


The stroke range on the exhaust side of 
maximum 14.25 mm corresponds to 
18.5° camshaft angle = 37° crankshaft angle. 
The stroke on the intake side of maximum 
25.25 mm corresponds to 30° camshaft angle 
= 60° crankshaft angle. 

When extended into the two piston chambers, 
the adjustment pistons are subject to a 
system pressure of 100 bar. They therefore 
extend only due to the different piston surface 
areas. The oil from the small piston chamber is 
transferred into the high pressure circuit. The 
proportional valve must be fully actuated in 
order to extend the adjustment piston. 




























































The holding function and piston retraction are 
achieved by reducing the oil feed on the side 
with the largest piston surface area by partly 
actuating the proportional valve. The reduced 
oil feed decreases the oil pressure, thus 
initiating a change in the forces exerted on the 


adjustment pistons. The retraction movement 
of the adjustment pistons is supported by the 
camshafts as they push back the spline shafts 
in the hydraulic units due to the helical gearing 
in the VANOS gear mechanism. 



VANOS gear mechanism 



o 


13 - VANOS gear mechanism 

The VANOS gear mechanism connects the 
crankshaft with the intake camshafts as well as 
the exhaust camshafts. The gear mechanism 
also permits "torsion" of the camshafts. The 
gear mechanisms for the intake and exhaust 
sides differ in terms of the exterior structure of 
the gear and chain drive while the adjustment 
mechanism on the inner side is identical.

The gear mechanism is driven by the drive 
gearwheel that interacts with the helical 
gearing on the inner sleeve. The threaded 
connections for the gearing connects the 
inner sleeve to the outer sleeve. With (wide) 
helical gearing, the inner sleeve acts on the 
bearing assembly for the drive gearwheel that 
is firmly secured to the camshaft with the 
central bolt.

Bearing for drive gearwheel 


The actuator (adjustment unit) is connected to 
the outer and inner sleeve by the screw 
connection of the gear mechanism. During 
adjustment, the inner sleeve and outer sleeve 
are pulled out of and pushed into the gear 
mechanism. 


The inner sleeve is turned by the helical 
gearing on the "fixed" drive gearwheel (timing 
chain drive). Due to the non-positive screw 
connection of the outer sleeve, this sleeve also 
turns. In connection with a further helical gear, 
the outer sleeve now turns the bearing for the 
drive gearwheel and in turn the camshaft 
connected with the central bolt. 


The gear units are mounted in their base 
position, i.e. pulled apart. The camshafts are 
adjusted when the gear units are pushed 
together. 

The drive gearwheel and bearing for the drive 
gearwheel are connected by a torsion spring 
to assist the return movement. 



15 - Intake gear mechanism adjusted 

The mounting screws for the gear mechanism 
are tightened only lightly when assembling the 
actuators. As a result, no force is transmitted 
from the outer sleeve to the inner sleeve when 
sliding the actuators onto the cylinder head (to 
facilitate the sliding movement of the gear 
unit). Due to the "fixed" drive gearwheel, the 
outer sleeve turns in the direction of engine 
rotation. At the same time the "fixed" bearing 
for the drive gearwheel turns the inner sleeve 
opposite the direction of engine rotation.

16 - Direction of rotation when sliding on the adjustment unit 


The exhaust camshaft is driven by the intake 
camshaft in connection with a gear drive 
mechanism. The drive gearwheel is split in two 
in order to avoid gearing noises caused by a 
change in the driving tooth profile in 
connection with a change in load. A disc spring 
turns the two halves of the gearwheel in 
opposing directions (functional principle 
similar to dual-mass flywheel) so that both 
tooth profiles of the exhaust gearwheel always 
rest on the intake gearwheel under all load 
conditions.

VANOS Pressure accumulator 

The pressure accumulator is preloaded with 
nitrogen. A piston separates the oil chamber 
from the gas chamber. 

The VANOS operating pressure is 115 bar. 
The shut-off valve on the pressure 
accumulator is closed when the engine is 
turned off. A pressure of 80 bar remains in the 


pressure accumulator which is immediately 
made available the next time the engine is 
started. 

A The repair instructions must be observed 
when performing any work on the pressure 
accumulator! ◄ 


Oil pumps 

The oil pump is driven by the VANOS high 
pressure pump in connection with a chain. 



18- Drive of oil pump 

The oil pump housing accommodates two oil 
pumps. The one is a duocentric pump that 
pumps the oil from the front oil sump to the 
rear oil sump. The other is a slide-valve type 
pump which takes the oil from the rear sump 
and conveys it to the oil filter at a variable 
pressure of up to 5 bar. 



19- Oil pan with oil pump 



21 - Slide-valve type pump 


The pump outlet is determined by the 
eccentricity of the pendulum-type slide valve. 
No oil is delivered when the pump runs 
centrally with respect to the rotor as all pump 
chambers are the same size. 

The slide valve is displaced by an inclined 
piston. This piston is in equilibrium between 
the piston spring and the engine oil pressure. 
The greater the engine oil pressure, the more 
the piston is pressed against the spring and 
the more the slide valve turns in the direction 
of 0 delivery.

Electric oil pumps 

When cornering at high speeds, the 
centrifugal force forces the engine oil into the 
outer cylinder head so that it can no longer 
flow back into the oil pan of its own accord. 

It must therefore be pumped off by the 
respective oil pump and returned to the oil 


sump. The electric oil pumps are activated by 
the engine control unit that determines the 
cornering speed with a yaw rate sensor. 

The electric oil pumps are protected by heat 
shields from the heat radiated from the 
exhaust manifolds. 


Oil spray nozzles 

Double-hook oil spray nozzles are used on the 
S85 for the purpose of cooling the piston 
crown. 


The oil spray nozzle is equipped with an 
integrated pressure control valve. 

Opening pressure: 1.8 to 2.2 bar 

Closing pressure: 1.3 to 1.9 bar 


Oil filter housing 

A thermostat that opens the path to the 
engine oil cooler is mounted in the head of the 
oil filter housing. 


Exhaust manifold 



The S 85 is equipped with a 5-in-1 exhaust 
manifold with near-engine catalytic converter 
for each cylinder bank. The pipes or runners of 
the manifold are made from stainless steel 
(X 15 Cr Ni Si 20-12) and have a wall thickness 
of 0.8 mm. 


24 - Exhaust manifold 



Intake air manifold 


The S85 features a separate intake air 
manifold for each cylinder bank that is 
mounted with hose clips on the throttle valve 
assemblies. 


Cyclone separators are installed in the intake 
air manifolds in the area of the fifth and tenth 
cylinder. The oil from the oil separators and 
the condensate from the manifolds merge in 
two channels in the crankcase behind the 
tenth cylinder and routed into the oil sump. 

The design of the intake air manifold is similar 
to that mounted on the S54. The shells are 
also made from PA66 on the S85 but they are 
joined together by a butt-welding process. 


25 - Cyclone separator (1) in intake air manifold 



Intake silencers 


The air to the intake silencers is drawn in via 
two routes. One from the area behind the 
kidney grille and the other from the large air 
inlets in the bumper. 



The S85 requires four air ducts in order to 
achieve maximum output. A large cross 
section could not be realized for package 
space reasons. In addition, the upper intake 
ducts define the fording capability of the M5. 

In the US version, the air cleaner element is 
additionally equipped with an activated carbon 
filter. This filter serves the purpose of ensuring 
no vapours containing hydrocarbons can 
escape from the intake area into the 
environment when the vehicle is stationary. 


26 - Intake silencers with air ducting 





Radiator 

The radiator of the S85 is divided into an upper 
and a lower water tank. The lower water tank 
serves the purpose of cooling the coolant from 
the cylinder side 1 - 5 while the upper tank is 


responsible for cooling the cylinder side 6-10. 
Due to this split design, it has been possible to 
reduce the pressure drop in the radiator from 
approx. 3 bar to approx. 1.4 bar. 


Thermostat 

Due to the two-section cooling concept, the 
thermostat on the S85 has been relocated in 
the return line. It is designed as a conventional 
thermostat that opens at a temperature of 
79 °C. 


The coolant from the cylinder heads enters 
the connection piece for the radiator feed and 
from here it is routed both via the double O- 
ring carrier into the thermostat as well as into 
the coolant supply hoses.

Introduction 

DMES85B50 


Introduction 


The S85B50 engine can develop a power 
output of 373 kW (507 bhp) and a maximum 
torque of 520 Nm. 

To ensure the available power is fully utilized at 
a maximum engine speed of 8,250 rpm while 
complying with legally stipulated exhaust 
emission regulations, the engine management 
MS_S65 further developed by Siemens on 
the basis of the MS_S54 was used for the first 
time. 


The use of the MS_S65 with its expanded 
functions made it possible to precisely control 
the engine based on the high speed concept. 

The S85B50 complies with the exhaust 
emission regulations 

• Europe: EU4 

• USA: US-LEV 2 

• Japan: Japan LEV 2000.

System overview 

DMES85B50 



The MS_S65 is a further development of the 
MS_S54 (MS_S54 HP, M3 CSL) that was 
used to control the S54 in the E46 M3. 

Additional functions used for the first time at 
BMW were implemented to facilitate the use 
of the S65 engine management on the 
S85B50: 


• Two-stage selectivity of the maximum 
engine power output 

• Transverse force-dependent control of the 
electric oil pumps 

• Requirement-controlled fuel delivery with 
variable fuel pressure 

• Knocking and misfiring detected by ionic 
current technology.

Functional Principle of the Digital Motor Electronics 


Engine torque control 

The EDR satellite serves the purpose of 
controlling the engine torque. The main 
control variable is the quantity of fresh air (air/ 
fuel mixture) supplied to the engine that can 
be varied by the position of the ten individual 
throttle valves and the two idle speed throttle 
valves. 

For the control system, the V 10 engine is 
divided into two identical blocks (cylinder 
banks) each with five cylinders. Each cylinder 
bank has an idle speed throttle valve and five 
individual throttle valves. 

The five individual throttle valves are 
mechanically coupled with each other per 
cylinder bank. 

The position of the idle throttle valve and the 
position of the five individual throttle valves are 
controlled by two actuators per cylinder bank 
an idle speed actuator (LLS) and an electric 
throttle valve actuator (EDR). 

The entire intake air control system therefore 
consists of four actuator motors for the throttle 
valves. 

For safety reasons, each throttle valve is 
equipped with a return spring that closes the 
throttle valves in the event of the respective 
actuator failing. 

All four actuator motors are controlled by the 
central engine management (DME). 

The DME calculates the target load signal for 
both cylinder banks from the input variables 
such as driver's load choice via the pedal value 
sensor, coolant temperature and from 
interventions of other control units (DSC, 
ACC,...). The DME then determines a set 
position for the throttle valves (set angle) from 
this target load signal. Initially, the potential of 
the idle throttle valves is exhausted before the 
individual throttle valves are opened to allow a 
substantially greater volume of air to be drawn 
in. 


Communication with the actuator motors 
takes place via the CAN busses. The two EDR 
are addressed via a separate CAN-bus and the 
two LLS via a common LLS-SMG CAN-bus. 

In order to set the engine power output 
corresponding to the input variables, the DME 
specifies for the actuators a target value 
relating to the throttle valve angle which the 
actuators then assume. 

One of the two Hall sensors of the throttle 
valve sensor 1 (DKG 1) is made available to the 
electric throttle valve actuator 1 (EDR 1) for 
the purpose of controlling the individual 
throttle valves. 

The second Hall sensor of DKG 1 is powered 
and read directly by the DME and only serves 
the purpose of monitoring the control of the 
EDR 1. (the same applies to actuator 2 
(EDR 2)). 

The two idle actuators feature an internal 
incremental angle transducer for controlling 
the throttle valve angle of the idle speed 
throttle valves. The sensor value is sent back 
to the DME via the CAN-bus. 

The DME determines the current actual load 
signal from the directly read throttle valve 
sensors and the feedback signals of the LLS in 
order to check the setting of the throttle 
valves. The plausibility of this load signal is 
checked against the signals of the two hot-film 
air mass meters (HFM) that measure the 
intake air masses per cylinder bank. 

If the deviations between the target and actual 
load signal are too great, the plausibility is 
additionally checked against the signal from 
the oxygen sensor. The DME responds with a 
corresponding fault reaction.

Pressure regulator in fuel tank 


In order to be able to make fuel at variable 
pressure available to the engine 
corresponding to the load status, the DME 
activates the fuel pumps by means of the EKP 
module such that the required target pressure 
is set irrespective of the quantity of fuel 
currently used. The target pressure varies 
between 3 and 6 bar and can be checked with 
a test module based on the target curve. 

Manual measurement is no longer necessary. 
The fuel control circuit consists of the 
following components: 

• Electric fuel pumps (EKP) 

• EKP module 

• Fuel tank with components and line system 

• Fuel pressure sensor 

• Digital motor electronics (DME) with the 
control logic.

The DME controls the EKP 1 corresponding

The EKP 2 cuts in non-regulated in the high 
load range. The pressure regulator in the tank 
is activated in a variable mode in order to set 
the fuel pressure to the target value with the 
activated second pump. 

The PWM interface is a single-wire interface, 
via which the DME activates the EKP module 
and therefore varies the delivery capacity of 
the electric fuel pump EKP. 


The task of the EKP module is to clock the 
electric fuel pump (EKP) via the output stage 
with precisely this pulse duty factor. The 
deviation of the pulse duty factor between the 
input and output PWM signal must not be 
greater than 3 %. 

This tolerance applies over the entire service 
life of the EKP module. The second electric 
fuel pump EKP additionally cuts in on reaching 
a pulse duty factor of 100 %. 








































Ionic current measurement 

For optimized engine management in terms of 
exhaust emission and fuel consumption, it is 
necessary to establish as accurately as 
possible the composition of the combustion 
mixture under all engine operating conditions. 

A method for achieving this aim is the so- 
called ionic current measurement. Ionic 
current measurement can be used for knock 
combustion control and detecting irregular 
idle speed (misfiring detection). 



4 - Ignition 


The ignition spark is triggered by the engine 
control unit. 

A low voltage is applied between the 
electrodes of the spark plug immediately after 
the end of the ignition spark and the resulting 
current (ionic current) is measured. 

The ionic current is measured and evaluated 
by the ionic current control unit.

DME. 

Both throttle valve sensors 1 and 2 are 
designed as double Hall sensors. These four 


sensors detect the position (angle) of the 
throttle valves of cylinder bank 1 and 2. 

The two Hall sensors integrated in one 
housing feature an inverted characteristic 
curve (one raising, one falling). 

The EDR uses the sensor with the raising 
characteristic for position control purposes. 

The DME uses the redundant sensor with 
falling characteristic to monitor the throttle 
valve control.

Secondary air pump 

The electric secondary air pump is 
maintenance-free. The integrated filter does 
not need to be changed. 


The pump is activated by the DME. The 
delivery capacity is always at 100 % and is not 
controlled. 














Mini HFM for secondary air system

A mini HFM measures the secondary air mass 
in the intake pipe of the secondary air pump. 

This monitoring facility has proven necessary 
in view of the ever lower exhaust emission 
values.

The familiar oxygen sensors LSU 4.9 with They are installed in the intake funnel of the 
continuous characteristic are used as the near-engine catalytic converters, 
primary oxygen sensors (control sensors). 


Secondary oxygen sensor (monitor sensor) 

The secondary oxygen sensors (monitor 
sensors) are the already familiar discontinuous 
characteristic sensors LSH 25. 


Exhaust gas temperature sensor 

The exhaust temperature sensors are This sensor is mainly used to protect the 

designed as NTC measuring elements. catalytic converters. 

The sensor can detect temperatures of up to 
approx. 1,200 °C. 


Pressure accumulator shut-off valve (VANOS) 


The shut-off valve ensures that the high 
pressure engine oil remains in the pressure 
accumulator after turning off the engine. 


The valve is therefore closed when no power 
is applied and is opened on request by the 
DME (no proportional opening).

Purpose of this Participant's Manual 


The Participant's Manual is a document 
designed to accompany a seminar while at the 
same time serving as a source of reference. 


This Participant's Manual describes the new 
features and further developments of the 
sequential M gearbox (SMG 3).

Introduction 

Sequential M gearbox SMG 3 


New 7-speed SMG 

A new 7-speed sequential M gearbox (SMG) 
has been developed for the E60 M5. The 
SMG 3 is designated SMG Getrag 247. 

In addition to the special functions such as 
launch control, hill ascent assistant, drive logic 
and tyre teach-in function, the SMG 3 is the 
first sequential M gearbox that has been 
specifically developed for automated 
operation. The central gearshift shaft has been 
replaced by individual selector rods. 

The hydraulic gearshift unit is a part of the 
gearbox casing and is no longer designed as 
an add-on part. Compared to the SMG 2 the 
gearshift times have been shortened by 20 %. 

Essentially, these shorter gearshift times have 
been achieved by individual selector rod 
operation and the use of carbon fibre friction 


cones in the synchronizer rings that facilitate 
shorter synchronization times through their 
higher load bearing capacity. 

Initialization procedures designed to ensure 
the system functions precisely may also be 
necessary after performing work on the 
vehicle that is not directly related to the 
gearbox. 

A It is essential that the information provided 
in the repair instructions is complied with for 
this purpose. ◄ 

The power is transmitted from the engine to 
the gearbox by a dual-mass flywheel supplied 
by LUK and a two-disc dry clutch supplied by 
Fichtel und Sachs.

Functions 

Sequential M gearbox SMG 3 


Special functions 
T ow-start 

The following procedure must be 
implemented to activate this function: 

• With the brake pedal depressed, turn the 
ignition key to terminal 15 

• Select position "N" 


• Tow-start/pus-start the vehicle 

• Shift selector lever to "S+" and hold in this 
position. 

The transmission control engages the gear 
corresponding to the speed and activates the 
clutch. 


Hill ascent assistant 

Compared to the SMG 2, the hill ascent 
assistant function has now been automated. 
This means the hill ascent assistant no longer 
needs to be selected manually with the minus 
shift paddle on the steering wheel and the 
brake depressed as was the case with the 
SMG 2 but it is now activated automatically 
when the transmission system recognizes any 
other position than "N". 


The hill ascent assistant in the SMG 3 is now 
an active system that makes use of the DSC to 
control the vehicle via the wheel brakes on 
uphill/downhill gradients (clutch load 
reduction). 

A Further information on the hill ascent 
assistant can be found in the Participant's 
Manual "DSC MK60E5". ◄ 


Launch control 

The following procedure must be 
implemented to activate the launch control 
function: 

• Vehicle stationary/engine running 

• DSC in "OFF" position 

• SMG in "S6" position 

• Hold selector lever in "Minus" position 

• Fully depress accelerator pedal and hold in 
this position 

• Release selector lever. 


The engine speed is controlled at 4,000 rpm 
in this function. After releasing the selector 
lever, the clutch is applied with defined slip in 
order to achieve the best acceleration values. 

The SMG uses the front wheel speeds to 
calculate and release the slip of the rear 
wheels. 

If the clutch monitoring logic detects clutch 
overheating, the clutch is fully engaged (100 
%) in order to protect the components. 


Teaching in the axle difference 

The teach-in function for the axle difference 
must be initiated manually after a change in 
the dynamic rolling circumference (tyre 
change, snow chains, etc.) of one or several 
wheels on the vehicle to ensure correct 
operation of the transmission control system. 

These differences are also adapted 
automatically but with a considerable time 
delay. 


This function is initiated manually as follows: 

• Vehicle speed between 30 and 
150 km/h 

• Transmission in position "N" 

• Brakes not applied 

• Pull both shift paddles on steering wheel for 
2 seconds. 




Clutch overload protection (KUS) 


The clutch overload protection function (KUS) 
protects the clutch from thermal overload. 

The clutch overload protection function 
makes use of an arithmetic logic in the SMG 
control unit that can calculate the thermal load 
of the clutch based on the slip and contact 
force. 

In the first stage, the clutch overload 
protection function reduces the slip at the 
clutch. The customer would refer to this as a 
"harsh gearshift". 


The anti-jolt function is activated as a further 
protection measure. As a result, the thermal 
input at the clutch discs is reduced and the 
driver's attention is drawn to the overload 
situation. 

If the temperature continues to increase, a 
warning is triggered in order to repeatedly 
draw the driver's attention to the overload 
situation. Start-off in 2nd gear is automatically 
inhibited when the gearbox warning is 
triggered in order to minimise the clutch slip. 



System components 

Sequential M gearbox SMG 3 


Transmission ratio of the SMG 3 


The SMG 3 is designed as an overdrive 
gearbox as can be clearly seen in the overview 
of gear ratios. 


A special feature of this gearbox is that the 
main shaft is mounted in three bearing 
assemblies. The third bearing assembly has 
been realized by an end shield bolted in the 
gearbox casing.

Signals and parameters 


Gear recognition 


The engaged gear is determined in a 
contactless arrangement by means of the Hall 
sensors on the actuators of the 

individual selector rods. The position of the 
working pistons is detected. 

Reversing light 


The redundant sensor system of the 1/R 
selector rod detects reverse gear when 
engaged and correspondingly informs the 
transmission control. 

The transmission control informs the lights 
switching centre that reverse gear is engaged. 

Gearbox oil temperature 


The gearbox oil temperature is determined 
indirectly via the hydraulic oil temperature 
sensor as both temperatures have a linear 
deviation with respect to each other. 

The SMG control unit uses this temperature 
value to operate the electric gear oil pump. 

Input speed 


The gearbox input speed is determined by a 
sensor. This sensor acquires the speed at the 

tooth flanks of the gear wheel on the 
countershaft. 


Clutch slave cylinder 


The clutch slave cylinder consists of two 
pistons and a spring between the two piston 
elements. The second piston is moved 
hydraulically. The second piston makes it 
possible to bleed the clutch slave cylinder in 
installed position without having to open any 
screws. 


A PLCD sensor (Permanentmagnetic Linear 
Contactless Displacement) is arranged 
separately in the housing of the clutch slave 
cylinder. This sensor determines the exact 
position of the release piston.

The PLCD sensor essentially consists of a 
special core made of soft magnetic material. 
The entire length of the core is enclosed by a 
coil (primary coil) with a further, short evaluator 
coil at each end. 



4 - PLCD sensor 


A permanent magnet approaching the sensor 
causes local magnetic saturation and 
therefore virtual division of the core. 


A voltage, depending on the position of the 
saturated area, is induced in the evaluator coils 
when an appropriate alternating current is 
applied to the primary coil. Consequently, the 
length of the virtual parts of the core and 
therefore the position of the saturated area 
can be determined in this way. 

The SMG control unit powers the sensor and 
correspondingly processes, evaluates and 
converts the signals. 

The alternating voltage necessary for this 
purpose is supplied by the ASIC (Application- 
Specific Integrated Circuit) integrated in the 
PLCD sensors. 


Selector lever 

The tasks of the selector lever are: 

• To select the ranges D-N-R 

• To change the operating modes D <-> S 

• To activate launch control 

• To activate the tow start function. 


Eight Hall sensors determine the selector 
lever positions which are sent individually to 
the transmission control. 

All selector lever positions are based on a 
redundant design where a sensor switches to 
ground and the corresponding redundant 
sensor switches in positive direction to ensure 
reliable detection even in the case of failure. 


Gearshift paddles 

The gearshift paddles can be used to perform 
the following functions: 

• Upshift and downshift (+/-) 

• Change of operating mode from "D" to "S" 


Manual initiation of wheel circumference 
teach-in function (the hill ascent assistant 
no longer needs to be activated manually). 


Drivelogic 

The Drivelogic selector switch can be used to 
choose between six gearshift programs in 
sequential mode and five shift programs in 
Drive mode. 


The shift speed and therefore the shift 
hardness are preselected in sequential mode. 

The shift points can be influenced by the 
setting in Drive mode. 


Brake light switch 

For redundancy reasons, the SMG control unit 
receives the signal from the brake light switch 
and the brake light test switch. 

The signal from the brake light switch is used 
for: 

• Shiftlock function 


• Brake detection 

• Engine start 

• Disengaging gear 

• DSC activation. 

The signal is made available via the CAN. 



Steering angle 

The signal is tapped off from the CAN. This gearbox (gearshift suppression), 
value influences the automatic function of the 

Longitudinal acceleration/gradient 

This value is determined by the longitudinal used for the purpose of calculating the 


acceleration sensor in the right footwell. It is 

gradient. 

Wake-up 

The SGM control unit assumes standby mode 
as soon as the vehicle is unlocked. As a result, 

the hydraulic unit generates sufficient 
pressure to disengage the clutch if necessary. 

Bonnet contact switch 


Two switches determine the bonnet status. 
The driver is warned if the bonnet is open. The 
vehicle can only start off immediately after 

engaging the drive stage as the status is 
unclear for the SMG. 

Door contact 


This signal should not be confused with the 
wake-up signal. 

Information on the door status is sent via the 
CAN to the SMG control unit. The gear is 
automatically disengaged when the door is 
opened. 

Trailer operation 

The SMG control unit is informed via the CAN- 
bus when the vehicle is used to tow a trailer, 

consequently activating the shift characteristic 
maps for trailer operation. 

Engine speed 

For redundancy reasons, this signal is made 
available via the CAN-bus as well as a 
hardware signal. It is used to control the clutch 
and to establish whether the engine is running. 

Within the safety concept, the engine speed 
signal is used to monitor the current status. 



Hydraulic system 



5- SMG with hydraulic unit 


Index Explanation 

1 Hydraulic unit 


A DC motor drives the hydrostatic pump. The 
pump conveys the hydraulic oil via a non¬ 
return valve into a pressure system while 
energy is stored in a hydraulic accumulator. 


The operating pressure is 75 bar. The 
maximum pressure is 90 bar which is applied 
only during initialization procedures. 

The maximum shift force is approx. 2,500 N. 








Service information 

Sequential M gearbox SMG 3 


Initialization 


As on the SMG 2, the SMG control unit must area of the clutch or gearbox as well as after 
newly adapt and store various parameters programming, 
after a component has been replaced in the 


Clutch teach-in function 

This function is used to adapt the clutch to the 
characteristics stored in the control unit. The 
clutch grab point is taught-in with the engine 
running. 

The clutch is released and, after the input 
shaft has stopped, initially, the clutch moves 
quickly close to the grab point and then slowly 
approaches the grab point. 


This procedure is terminated if a transmission 
input speed is already measured during the 
fast approach phase as there is obviously a 
fault in the system (e.g. bleeding). 

If a valid value is measured during the slow 
approach of the clutch towards the grab point 
this value is stored in the SMG control unit. 


Adaptations 

It is necessary to check the gearbox 
mechanism after replacing a gearbox, 
components of a gearbox or the SMG control 
unit. The following adaptations are provided in 
the GTI/DISplus. 

The most important adaptations in the 
gearbox are: 

• Shift range mid-points 

• Valve characteristics 

• Transmission characteristics 

• Longitudinal acceleration sensor offset. 

Shift range mid-points 

This function ensures a gear can be 
disengaged without previous adaptation of 
the transmission characteristics. 

Valve characteristics 

The shift range valves in the hydraulic system 
are designed as proportional valves. Due to 
the tolerance scatter in series production, it is 
necessary to teach in the offset current of 
these valves. 

The current at which the corresponding 
selector rod begins to move is determined. 
This value is stored as the offset current in the 
SMG control unit. 

The current consumption of the proportional 
valves is determined in both switching 
directions. 


Transmission characteristics 

In this adaptation phase, the selector rods are 
moved to the end positions and the actual 
values determined. 

The measured values indicate whether a gear 
is engaged. 

The selector rod for reverse gear is 
additionally monitored by a redundant sensor 
whose values are also stored. 

In addition, the hydraulic pressure is read off at 
this selector rod and the selector rod is 
monitored to ensure it remains in the end 
position. 

Longitudinal acceleration sensor 

The measured value of the longitudinal 
acceleration sensor has a constant offset. This 
value is determined when the vehicle is at rest 
in horizontal position and therefore the 
longitudinal acceleration is zero. 

The actual values are permanently sampled. 
As soon as a sample value deviates by more 
than a reference value, external influences are 
assumed and the adaptation procedure is 
terminated to ensure no falsified acceleration 
values are measured during vehicle operation. 



Pressure accumulator preload 

A function for checking the accumulator 
prepressure has been implemented to 
facilitate diagnosis for service applications. 

The diagnostic procedure evaluates the time 
required to discharge the accumulator. The 
pressure sensor of the hydraulic unit is used to 
measure the pressure. 

The SMG control unit still measures the time 
required for filling. If a shorter period of time is 


required to reach the cutoff pressure this 
indicates that the nitrogen, which the 
accumulator must contain as the preload 
medium, has leaked out of the accumulator. 

The shut-off valve on the pressure 
accumulator is monitored separately.

This Participant's Manual describes the new 
features and further developments of the 
dynamic stability control (DSC) MK60E5.

Introduction 

Dynamic Stability Control MK60E5 


MK60E5 from Continental Teves 


The E60 M5 is equipped with the Continental 
Teves Dynamic Stability Control System 
(DSC+) MK60E5. 

This system offers the customer further 
functions that were not yet realized with the 
previous systems. 


New functions 

• Brake readiness 

• Dry braking 

• Hill ascent assistant. 


Features of the MK60E5 

The features of this system distinctly enhance 
comfort during control intervention while 
facilitating even more precise individual wheel 
braking in connection with the analogue 
control valves. 


With this system it has been possible to 
reduce the required braking distance to a 
minimum. 

The E60 M5 can realize a braking distance of 
< 36 m from a speed of 100 km/h.

System overview 

Dynamic Stability Control MK60E5 


Further development of the MK60psi 


The MK60E5 is a further development of the 
MK60psi, which is currently used in the E87. 

The abbreviation "psi" stands for "pressure 
sensor integrated" i.e. the two pressure 
sensors of the tandem master brake cylinder 
(THZ) have been combined to form one 
plausibility sensor and integrated in the 
hydraulic unit. 

The designation "E5" in MK60E5 signifies the 
5 pressure sensors that are integrated in the 


hydraulic unit: One pressure sensor that 
measures the pressure from the tandem 
master brake cylinder THZ and four further 
sensors that measure the braking pressure of 
the respective wheel brake. 

As in the DSC 8.0, the tyre failure indicator 
(RPA) is integrated in the DSC functions.

Functions 

Dynamic Stability Control MK60E5 


DSC Additional Functions 

Compared to the standard DSC features, the 
MK60E5 in the E60 M5 has been upgraded 
by the following additional functions: 

• M Dynamic Mode (MDM) 

• Brake readiness 

• Dry braking 

• Hill ascent assistant. 


The following functions are not required on 
the M5: 

• Performance control (FLR) 

• Soft stop 

• Fading brake support (FBS) 

• Dynamic traction control (DTC). 


Operating modes of the MK60E5 

In principle, the MK60E5 has 3 different 
operating modes: 

• DSC ON 

• DSC OFF 

• M Dynamic mode. 


There is no DTC function in connection with 
the M5. However, similar to DTC mode, 
corresponding control thresholds are raised 
by activating the MDM. 

M Dynamic Mode can be activated only via the 
M-Drive. 


M Dynamic Mode (MDM) 

MDM gives the performance-oriented driver 
the option of driving the car with controlled 
float angle and longitudinal slip without DSC 
intervening. The control system intervenes 
only when the physical limits are exceeded. 


The control thresholds are not static but 
rather, as the speed increases, they approach 
the thresholds of DSC ON mode. 

The stability control thresholds are identical as 
from a speed of approx. 200 km/h in order not 
to overtax the driver in the high speed range. 


Brake readiness 

The brake response time is shortened during 
full brake application by applying the brake 
pads to the discs while rapidly restricting the 
throttle. 

This function ensures that a pressure of 
approx. 3 bar is applied for a period of up to 


300 ms to the wheel brakes in order to apply 
the brake pads already before the expected 
application of the brakes. This function 
facilitates even more rapid response of the 
brakes. The function is active as from a speed 
of 30 km/h. 


Dry braking 

The brake response characteristics are 
improved in wet conditions by removing the 
water film on the brake discs. 

The DSC detects rain and therefore wet brake 
discs through the permanent operation of the 
windscreen wiper motor. 


The dry braking function applies approx. 3 bar 
hydraulic pressure to the wheel brakes under 
these conditions. This procedure is repeated 
every 2-3 km for a period of approx. 3 s when 
the accelerator pedal is sufficiently depressed 
(> 10 %), the vehicle speed is > 90 km/h and 
the brakes were not applied over the last 2- 
3 km. 



Hill ascent assistant 

Assistance is provided when driving off on 
uphill gradients by briefly maintaining a 
specific brake pressure in the wheel brakes. 

This function is active only when the 
transmission is not in "N" position and the 
handbrake is released. 

DSC ON/OFF has no influence in this case. 

The tilt angle (uphill and downhill gradient) is 
calculated from the measured value of the 
longitudinal acceleration sensor. 

The DSC calculates the necessary holding 
pressure based on the uphill or downhill 
gradient. 


After releasing the brake paddle, the braking 
pressure is immediately decreased to the 
calculated holding pressure which is then 
reduced in stages after a maximum time delay 
of 0.7 s. The vehicle will start off after approx. 
1 s if the driver does not press the accelerator 
pedal. 

The longitudinal acceleration sensor is 
assigned to the SMG system. 

This function is also active on an incline with 
reverse gear engaged. 


Condition Based Service (CBS)

Introduction 

Displays, Indicators and Controls 


Additional Functions 


Compared to the 545i, the E60 M5 provides 
the driver with additional functions relating to 
the displays, indicators and controls as well as 
for setting the individual systems. 


In the following, the individual elements are 
presented as they will be realized at series 
launch. 

The Owner's Handbook provides general 
information on how to use the controls.

System overview 

Displays, Indicators and Controls 


Differences compared to the E60 


The M5 instrument cluster is based on the 
instrument cluster of the E60 545i. The 
changes to the visual appearance and the 
additional functions are described in detail in 
the chapter System Components. 

The head-up display (HUD) has been adopted 
from the E60 as the additional functions relate 
to the HUD software. 


The "M-Drive" menu item in the central 
information display (CID) has been created 
simply by corresponding software 
adaptations. 

The M-Drive settings are stored key-specific 
in the engine management and are called up 
accordingly. The engine management can 
store up to 10 different settings in the 
memory.

Displays and indicators in the E60 M5 


Instrument cluster 


The instrument cluster in the M5 is based on 
that of the E60 Series. Corresponding 
adaptations have been implemented in the 
visual appearance and scope of functions for 
use in the M5. 


• Oil temperature gauge in rev counter 

• SMG display with Drivelogic display. 

The M5 instrument cluster additionally 
features the following indicator lamps: 


The additional functions are: 

• Oil level indication in the on-board 
computer 

• Lighting at terminal 15 ON 


MDM for DSC dynamic mode

Light ON. 



Head-up display (HUD) 

The "M-view" has been added to the head-up 
display. This expansion feature, however, is 
implemented only in the software of the HUD 
control unit. 

The M-view can be configured in the "Display 
Settings" menu in the i-Drive or with the 
M-Drive and activated via the M-Drive 
Manager. 

The head-up display in the M-view can show 
the following information: 

• All warnings 

• Engine speed with shift lights in the speed 
indicator (not the absolute value) 

• Road speed 

• Engaged gear.

Oil level indicator 

The M5 is equipped with an electronic oil level 
indicator. The oil level is indicated in the 
information field of the on-board computer 
(BC) in the instrument cluster. 

The average speed information was removed 
from the BC menu to accommodate the oil 
level indication in the on-board computer. 

The display is selected with the BC control. 
The sensor is the quality and condition sensor 
(QLT) from the E65. The entire measurement 
logic is resident in the engine management 
MS_S65.

The long-term value last stored is shown after 
starting the engine. 

Basically there are two different measuring 
methods: Long-term measurement and quick 
measurement 

Long-term measurement 

The engine management permanently 
measures the oil level and derives the mean 
value from the measurement results which is 
then shown in the on-board computer. 

The DME requires an engine operating time of 
approx. 10 minutes to establish a long-term 
value. 


Quick measurement 

The quick measurement method provides the 
option of measuring the oil level with only a 
short time delay (e.g. topping up oil, oil 
service). 

The quick measurement must be initiated 
manually by pressing and holding the BC 
button (approx. 2 seconds) in the oil level 
indication setting. 

The displayed value indicates the quantity of 
oil above the minimum level. The value should 
be between MIN 0.0 I and MAX 1.0 I.

Display: 1.5 I means overfilled, the bar 
indicator is additionally filled above Maximum. 
Values from 1.0 to 1.4 are suppressed. 


















Perform quick measurement 

• Park vehicle in horizontal position 

• Engine running at idle speed 

• Oil temperature above 70 °C 

• Select engine oil level indicator in on-board 
computer 

• Press and hold BC button > 2 s. 

The oil level display changes and shows only 
two dashes (see Fig.) and a clock symbol. The 


clock symbol indicates that the oil level is 
being measured. The clock symbol would 
disappear if the engine speed is now 
increased. The measurement is continued as 
soon as the measurement criteria are met 
again. 

The pure measuring time is approx. 60 s. 

The long-term value last stored is deleted with 
initiation of the quick measurement.
