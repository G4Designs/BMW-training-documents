M Engine Management System 

Model: All with S85 engine 
Production: From Start of Production 



After completion of this module you will be able to: 

• Understand the construction of the S85 V-10 engine 

• Identify and locate components related to MS_S65 engine management 

• Perform basic procedures related to MS_S65 engine management 

• Diagnose concerns related to MS_S65 engine management 



MS S 65 Engine Management System 


In order to meet the demands of the S85 engine, the Siemens 
MS_S65 engine management system has been developed in 
conjunction with BMW M GmbH. The high-rewing S85 engine 
complies with the EPA LEV 2 standards while maintaining reason¬ 
able fuel economy. This is only possible in conjunction with 
“world-class” engine management. 

The DME control unit in the MS_S65 engine management sys¬ 
tem boasts the most powerful ECM to date. Found on the E60 
M5 and E63 /E64 M6, the MS_S65 system is a further develop¬ 
ment of the MS_S54 engine management with some notable 
improvements. 

The DME (ECM) is also responsible for monitoring over 50 input 
signals. 


Some of the functions of the MS_S65 engine management 
include: 

• Control and synchronization of 10 individual throttles 

• Control of 2 electric oil “scavenging” pumps during cornering 

• Demand oriented fuel delivery controlled by engine manage¬ 
ment 

• The use of “ionic current measurement” for knock control 
and misfire detection

M Engine Management System 


Processor Power 

The computing power has been increased to meet the needs of 
the “high-revving” S85 powerplant. The DME (ECM) is capable of 
more than 200 million calculation per second. This is accom¬ 
plished with three - 32 bit processors and a multi-layer circuit board 
with over 1000 individual parts. 

Adapter Cables 

The MS_S65 ECM requires the use of special breakout box 
adapter cables. These are carried over from the MSV70 engine 
management. These adapter are used with overlays to properly 
identify the pin connections during diagnosis. 



E-Box Fan 

The E Box fan is controlled by ECM. The ECM contains an integral 
NTC temperature sensor for the purpose of monitoring the E box 
temperature and activating the fan. 

When the temperature in the E-Box exceeds predetermined values, 
the ECM provides a switched ground for the E Box fan to cool the 
control modules located in the E-Box. 

With every engine start-up, the ECM briefly activates the fan 
ensuring continued fan motor operation for the service life of the 
vehicle. This feature is intended to prevent fan motor “lock up” from 
lack of use due to pitting or corrosion overtime. 

































Power Supply 

Terminal 30 (KL30) Battery Voltage 

The B+ power supply to the ECM comes from a 7.5amp fuse. 

On the M5 and M6, KL30 comes from fuse #26 (F26) which is 
located in the front fuse holder behind the glove box. 

Engine Fuses 

The engine electronics fuses are located in the E-box. However, 
there are now three separate fuse carriers in the E-Box. These 
fuses are supplied by KL87 from the ECM main relay. 

The three fuse carriers are designated A8582, A8683 and A8680. 
The fuses in these carriers are designated as shown below. 


Terminal 15 (KL15) 

As with previous vehicles equipped with PT-CAN, the ECM 
receives a KL15w via the bus network and a “hardwire” KL15 
wake-up signal directly from the CAS. 

When the ignition is switch “ON”, the ECM receives the wake-up 
signal via CAS, then it will energize the ECM main relay to supply 
power to the engine electronics fuse carrier to energize other 
engine related components and systems. 

Ground (KL31) 

There is a KL31 connection to the ECM at connector X60003 
pin #4.

Interfaces 

The M5 and M6 continue to use the familiar PT-CAN 
bus. However, there are two new “local” CAN bus net¬ 
works. One is for the throttle motor control (DK-CAN) 
and the other for the idle system control (LL-CAN). The 
LL-CAN is connected to the SMG as well.

Air Management 

Throttle System 

As with previous “M” engine designs, there are individual throttles 
for each cylinder. The throttles are “bank” controlled via two EDR 
actuators (1 per bank). The 5 throttle valves on each bank are 
mechanically coupled with each other. Also, each cylinder bank 
has an idle control valve. Therefore, there are a total of 4 actuators 
for engine intake air control. 

The two throttle actuator motors (EDR) and two idle control actua¬ 
tors (LLS) are connected to the ECM via separate local CAN bus 
systems. The throttle valve actuators are connected to the DK- 
CAN and the idle speed actuators are connected to the LLS/SMG 
CAN. 



Throttle Valve Actuator 

One actuator motor (EDR actuator) moves 
five mechanically coupled throttle valves 
on each cylinder bank. Each actuator con¬ 
sists of an electric motor with a gear 
mechanism and internal electronics. 

The electronic control module within the 
EDR actuator allow the ECM (DME) to 
control, monitor and diagnose the throttles 
via the DK-CAN connection. 



Due to the CAN connection between the 
actuators, synchronization of both banks can be carried out elec¬ 
tronically. 


In addition to the DK-CAN connection, there is a so-called “Enable 
line” (S_DK1/S_DK2) between the DME and throttle-valve actuator. 
Across this “Enable line”, the DME can switch off the throttle-valve 
actuator if there are communication faults on the DK-CAN. 


Pin 4 on the throttle-valve actuator of bank 1 is switched to ground. 
This makes it possible to detect which throttle-valve actuator is fit¬ 
ted on which bank. 



M Engine Management System 

11 











12 

M Engine Management System 


Throttle Valve Position Sensor (DKG) 

There is one throttle valve position sensor (DKG) per bank. Each 
sensor contains 2 throttle position sensors (hall type) as well as 
internal electronics. The internal electronics make it possible for 
the throttle valve position sensor to communicate with the ECM 
(DME) via a local CAN bus. The local CAN bus is referred to as 
DK-CAN which uses the familiar three wire configuration. 

One throttle valve position sensor is located on the throttle housing 
for cylinder 5 (bank I) and the other is located on the throttle hous¬ 
ing for cylinder 6 (bank II). Each sensor contains 2 feedback hall 
sensors to detect throttle plate position. 

One of the hall sensors is monitored by the EDR actuator which 
also supplies B+ power and ground (B-) for the sensor. The throttle 
position value is then sent to the ECM via the local CAN (DK-CAN). 



The sensor signal is “inverted” which means that the signal 
decreases as the throttle opens. In the event of failure, the affected 
EDR actuator unit is switched off. 

A second hall sensor is responsible for monitoring (plausibility). It is 
powered and read by the ECM (DME). This hall sensor sends the 
signal with the “rising” characteristic in which the signal voltage 
increases as the throttle opens. 

■ DK-CAN 

There are two - 240 Ohm resistors, one in each EDR motor. The 
resistors are in parallel between DK-CAN-Hi and DK-CAN-Lo for a 
total resistance of 120 Ohms. 



Cylinder5 


Cylinder 6 











Idle Speed Actuator (LLS) 

The two idle speed actuators use a “throttle type” design (1) and 
are in the “V-area” between the cylinder heads. In addition to the 
internal electric motor to control the idle valve “throttle plate, the 
LLS contains an incremental angle transducer for monitoring the 
position of the idle valve (plate). 

This information is processed internally (in LLS) and communicat¬ 
ed to the ECM via LLS/SMG-CAN. The idle speed actuators are 
initialized automatically when the engine is stationary and the igni¬ 
tion is ON. 

At idle and low load conditions, the intake air is controlled by the 2 
idle speed actuators. The idle actuators are controlled via the local 
CAN bus which connects the ECM (DME), the SMG and the 2 
actuators (one LLS per bank). 


The engine control module determines the current actual load sig¬ 
nal from the throttle valve sensors (DKG) and feedback signals from 
the LLS actuators in order the check the setting of the throttle 
valves. The plausibility of the load signal is checked against the 
signals of the two hot-film air mass meters. 

If the deviations between the target and actual load signals show 
any discrepancies, the plausibility is checked against the 02 sen¬ 
sors as well. The ECM will respond the appropriate fault code if 
the situation falls outside the programmed parameters. 

Similar to past systems the engine speed is controlled by the idle 
valves (LLS) until a certain load requirement is reached. This 
means that the potential for the idle throttle valves (LLS) will be 
exhausted before the individual throttle valves are opened. This 
allows an overall greater volume of air to be drawn into the engine.

Accelerator Pedal Module 

The accelerator pedal module provides the input for the driver’s 
request. The accelerator pedal module contains dual Hall sensors 
which the ECM monitors for plausibility. The ECM provides an 
independent voltage and ground supply for each hall sensor. Each 
Hall sensor is provided with 5 volts and ground. As the accelerator 


pedal is moved from rest to full throttle, the sensors produce a vari¬ 
able voltage signal. 

The Hall sensors are checked for plausibility. The voltage range of 
Hall sensor 1 is approximately .5 to 4.5 volts. Hall sensor 2 ranges 
from approximately .5 to 2.5 volts.

Hot Film Air Mass Meter (HFM) 

The HFM is a Bosch type (HFM 5.0) with a CL bypass. There is 
one HFM for each bank. They are located in the intake silencers 
and incorporate the “plug-in” design. 



Intake Air Temperature Sensor 

The intake air temperature sensor is integrated into the HFM hous¬ 
ing. The sensor is an NTC type which receives 5 volt reference 
and ground from the ECM. The HFM sends a varying 5 volt analog 
signal to the ECM. 

Intake Silencers 

The air to the intake silencers (air filter housing), is drawn in via two 
pathways. One is from the area behind the kidney grille and the 
other from the large air inlets in the bumper. 

The S85 requires 4 air ducts in 
order to achieve maximum out¬ 
put. For space reasons, there 
are 4 inlets to the air filter hous¬ 
ings, rather than 2 large ones. 


Crankcase Ventilation 

The crankcase ventilation system on the S85 is used to separate 
liquid oil from crankcase gasses. The cyclone separators are inte¬ 
grated into the left and right intake plenums (1). The liquid oil from 
the separators is returned to the crankcase via two plastic hoses 
which are routed to the oil sump. The lines feed into two check 
valves behind cylinder 10. 



There are also 2 check valves (one in each valve cover) which also 
allow any accumulated oil to drain back from the intake plenum 
housings. 




M Engine Management System 

17 










18 

M Engine Management System 


Vacuum Pump 

Although the S85 does not use Valvetronic, the assistance of an 
external vacuum pump is required under various operating condi¬ 
tions. In some operating modes, especially with a cold engine, 
when the catalyst heating function is active there is insufficient par¬ 
tial engine vacuum available for brake power assistance. There is 
also reduced engine vacuum when using “race track” (M-Dynamic) 
mode or when the vehicle is rolling with KL15 on and the engine 
off. 

To make up for this limited vacuum period, there is a supplemental 
electric vacuum pump. The electric vacuum pump(2) is controlled 
via the ECM (DME). The pump is installed on the left in the engine 
compartment under the left microfilter housing. 


The vacuum pump is switched on at -250 mbar and switched off 
at -600 mbar. 

An external pressure sensor (1), signals the pressure difference 
from the brake booster compared to the ambient pressure from the 
internal ambient pressure sensor in the ECM (DME). (See diagram 
on the next page) 

When vacuum is required, the ECM activates the relay which in 
turn then actuates the electric vacuum pump. The cut-in and cut¬ 
out thresholds are controlled as a function of the differential pres¬ 
sure and the vehicle speed. 

The software in the ECM is configured such that the correct vacu¬ 
um is available in the brake booster under all driving conditions. 


The vacuum pump is designed as a vane-type pump. The prevail- With relatively little vacuum in the brake booster, the engine must

order to activate the electric vacuum pump.

A test module is provided in ISTA/GT1 for the electric vacuum 
pump. The differential pressure sensor on the brake booster is 
used for the purpose of monitoring the pump. 

The plausibility is checked by the pressure difference between the 
vacuum and ambient pressure calculated internally in the ECM. It 
is evaluated and, in the case of fault, shown in the instrument clus¬ 
ter and displayed as a CC message (check control). 


If the electric vacuum pump is found to be defective during the 
self-diagnosis procedure, the safety concept manager (SK manag¬ 
er) intervenes and shuts down cylinder bank II (Cylinders 6-10). 
The smaller opening cross section in the intake duct of cylinder 
bank 6-10 thus ensures adequate vacuum in the brake booster. 

In the case of fault the safety concept manager triggers an "engine 
symbol as well as a CC message (check control) "engine malfunc- 
tion/power loss" in the instrument cluster.

Emergency Programs 

The fault code "electric vacuum pump for Mastervac" (Mastervac = 
brake booster) is stored in the fault code memory in connection 
with the fault types "short to positive", "short to ground" and "line 
break". The following actions are initiated: 

• Maximum torque 200 Nm 

• Maximum engine speed 3500 rpm 

• Maximum vehicle speed 150 km/h 

The following actions are initiated in connection with the fault 
"pump not running": 


Fuel Supply and Management 

The fuel system on the S85 engine is a “demand-oriented” system 
which uses a variable fuel pressure delivery concept. The fuel 
pressure can be varied between 3 and 6 bar. This method of fuel 
delivery allows maximum delivery when needed, but also reduces 
HC losses from the fuel tank by keeping the overall fuel volume to 
the minimum. Additional benefits include increased service life of 
the fuel pump. 

The fuel control circuit consists of the following components: 

• Electric fuel pumps (2-EKP) 


• Maximum torque 100 Nm 

• Maximum engine speed 2000 rpm 

• Maximum vehicle speed 50 km/h 


• EKP module 

• Fuel tank with components and line system 

• Fuel pressure sensor 

• Digital motor electronics (DME) with the control logic

The EKP module is located in the luggage compartment on the

The output stage of the EKP module has been modified to accom¬ 
modate two fuel pump output circuits and the associated control 
logic. 





Fuel Pressure Sensor 

The fuel pressure sensor is located in the front left wheel arch. The 
sensor is used to measure the current fuel pressure and to transfer 
the pressure value reading to the engine management. 

The fuel pressure sensor renders manual fuel pressure testing 
unnecessary. Fuel pressure values can now be displayed using 
the BMW diagnostic equipment.

From approximately 5000 RPM (also load dependent), the second 
fuel pump (EKP2) is switched on at 100%. EKP 1 is also switched 
to 100%. At this point, the mechanical fuel pressure regulator is 
responsible for setting maximum fuel pressure to 6 bar. 

The EKP module is controlled by the ECM over a single wire PWM 
interface. The pulse width of the signal dictates the delivery capac¬ 
ity of the electric fuel pump. The task of the EKP module is to 
clock the electric fuel pump (EKP) via the output stage with pre¬ 
cisely this pulse duty factor. The deviation of the pulse duty factor 
between the input and output PWM signal must not be greater 
than 3%. 


This tolerance applies over the entire service life of the EKP mod¬ 
ule. The second electric fuel pump EKP additionally cuts in on 
reaching a pulse duty factor of 100%. 

Emergency Program 

If faults are detected in the fuel supply system, the fuel system is 
run in emergency mode. At this point, both pumps are operated 
with 100% activation.

Fuel Injectors 

The injectors are mounted into machined bores located in the 
throttle housings. This design allows the injectors to be closely 
mounted to the intake valves. 

The injectors are a compact design manufactured by Bosch with a 
resistance value of approximately 12 ohms each. 

Power supply for the fuel injectors is from Terminal 87 of the fuel 
injector relay which is controlled by the CAS. 



Fuel Rail 

The fuel rail is a non-return design which does NOT include a 
service port for diagnosis. Fuel pressure is measured by the ECM 
via a fuel pressure sensor. The sensor is located in the driver’s side 
front wheel arch.

Ignition Management 

The ignition system on the MS-S65 engine management uses 
several inputs to control ignition functions. There are some 
changes as compared to previous BMW engine management sys¬ 
tems. The knock sensors have been eliminated in favor of a new 
“ionic current” measuring system. The new “ionic current” moni¬ 
toring system is also capable of detecting misfires as well. 

Ignition Coil 

As with most recent ignition coil designs, the “pencil” or “rod” type 
ignition coils are used in the S85 engine. 

The ignition coils are manufactured by Bremi or Bosch. The igni¬ 
tion coils are triggered by the ionic current control units based on 
signals from the ECM. 

The Zener diode in the secondary winding has been eliminated to 
allow ionic current measurement. 



Spark Plugs 

With the introduction of the new ionic current monitoring technolo¬ 
gy, the spark plugs for the S85 have been specially manufactured 
by NGK. 

The new (LKR8AP) spark plug uses a two-prong ground electrode, 
with a center electrode which has a laser welded platinum ring. 

The plug also features a very long reach (26.5mm) and a 12 mm 
thread. 

The spark plug now carries out two functions: 

• To provide a gap between the spark plug electrodes 

• To act as a sensor for ionic current monitoring 

Crankshaft Position Sensor 

This sensor provides the crankshaft position and engine speed 
(RPM) signal to the ECM for Fuel Pump and Injector operation. 

This is a “Hall Effect” type sensor mounted on the transmission 
bell housing (3). The impulse wheel is mounted on the outer cir¬ 
cumference of the flywheel. The impulse wheel contains 58 teeth 
with a gap of two missing teeth. The gap of two missing teeth pro¬ 
vides a reference point that the ECM recognizes as crankshaft 
position. 
















Ionic Current Control Units 

There are 2 ionic current control units which are located at the front 
of the engine on top of the respective cylinder head cover. These 
units are manufactured by Helbako and are responsible for control 
of the ignition coils via signals from the ECM (DME). 

In addition to ignition coil control, the ionic current control unit is 
used to measure ionic current during the combustion period (after 
ignition). These measurements are used by the engine manage¬ 
ment to monitor knock as well as misfiring.

Ionic Current Measurement 

Ionic current monitoring technology holds many benefits for the 
detection of misfires and engine knock. Currently, misfires are 
detected by monitoring the crankshaft for speed fluctuations. This 
method is limited on very smooth running engines, particularly on 
those with more than 8-cylinders. 

Ionic current technology makes it possible to monitor both misfires 
as well as engine knock. This is done mostly with existing hard¬ 
ware. The spark plug is now assigned a dual role. In addition to 
supplying the air gap which makes ignition possible, the spark plug 
is now used as a “current probe” to measure ionization during 
combustion. 

Once the ignition phase has ended, the combustion phase begins 
with a uniform flame front across the combustion chamber. During 
the combustion period, heat and pressure ionize particles in the 
combustion chamber in the area of the spark plug electrodes. 

These ions can be measured to give an indication of cylinder pres¬ 
sure. The cylinder pressure peaks can be interpreted to show 
combustion quality. 

Ionic current progression is directly dependent on the cylinder 
pressure and the ions in the cylinder. In other words, the quantity 
of ions is dependent upon the quality of combustion. 

The ionic current is measured after ignition occurs. A low voltage 
is applied between the electrodes of the spark plug immediately 
after the end of the ignition spark and the resulting current (ionic 
current) is measured. The ionic current is measured and evaluated 
by the ionic current control unit and the ECM (DME). 

The combustion progression in the combustion chamber can be 
represented by the combustion chamber or cylinder pressure 
curve. 


As a general rule : 

• Poor combustion = low cylinder pressure 

• Good combustion = high cylinder pressure

During various combustion events, free ions additionally split off or 
separate due to abnormal pressure peaks that occur in the com¬ 
bustion chamber when knocking or detonation occurs. This results 
in a change in the ionic current progression (curve). 


The ionic current is measured and evaluated in the ionic current 
control unit. The ECM will make necessary corrections to control 
knocking. This method of knock detection eliminates the need for 
knock sensors. Also, the possibility for erroneous knock signals 
is eliminated.

Bosch LSU Oxygen Sensor 

A “wide-band planar” oxygen sensor used on the S85. The new 
Bosch LSU 4.9 sensor is carried over from the N62TU and N52 
engines. Compared with the LSU 4.2 oxygen sensor previously 
used, the LSU sensor is twice as fast. Full operational readiness 
is achieved after 10 seconds (LSU 4.2 20 seconds). 


This rapid starting capability is made possible by the use of a 
smaller ceramic element. The outer dimensions of the sensor 
remain unchanged. 

The previous opening for the supply of ambient air has been elimi¬ 
nated. The new sensor differs from the LSU 4.2 in that a porous 
layer which is permeable by air is used instead of a reference air 
channel. The ambient air is directed to the element via the sensor 
wiring.

Post Catalyst Oxygen Sensors 

The post catalyst oxygen sensors are the Bosch LSF 4.2 type. 
They operate similarly to the previous LSH 25 sensors. The volt¬ 
age range is .10 to 1.0 volts. 

The new planar 4.2 sensors offer: 


Exhaust Gas Temperature Sensor 

The exhaust temperature sensors are designed as NTC measuring 
elements. The sensor can detect temperatures of up to approxi¬ 
mately. 1,200°C. Two exhaust-gas temperature sensors (one on 
each cylinder bank of the S85) provide exhaust-gas temperature 
readings to the DME (ECM) to protect the catalytic converter. 


• Fast light-off (ready for control <10 s) 

• Wide operating temperature range 


From 03/2006, the signals from the exhaust gas temperature sen¬ 
sors in DME are no longer used. However, the exhaust gas tem¬ 
perature sensors were still fitted until 09/2006. 


• Stable control characteristic 

• Improved exhaust gas values 


Post Catalyst Oxygen Sensors 


The signals were replaced by calculated exhaust gas temperature 
values. The exhaust gas temperatures are also no longer diagnosed 
in the DME. 

Note: From 03/2006, the signals from the exhaust gas 
temperature sensors are no longer monitored.

Secondary Air System 

Injecting ambient air into the exhaust stream after a cold engine 
start reduces the warm up time of the catalysts and reduces HC 
and CO emissions. The ECM controls and monitors the 
Secondary Air Injection. 

An Electric Secondary Air Pump and Air Injection Valve direct fresh 
air through an internal channel in the cylinder head into the exhaust 
ports. The Air Injection Valve is opened by air pressure (from the 
pump) and is closed by an internal spring. 

The relay for the secondary air pump is located in the E-box. 

The secondary air pump is eguipped with an additional intake hose 
to accommodate a secondary air filter with the mini HFM. The mini 
HFM is secured in the secondary air filter with two screws. 



■ Mini Hot Film Air Mass Sensor (HFM) 

A compact mini hot film air mass sensor (HFM manufactured by 
Siemens) is used in the secondary air system for the S85 engine in 
the M5 and M6. 

The mini HFM detects the air mass supplied by the secondary-air 
pump. This function monitors the secondary air system for OBD 
compliance. 

When the mini HFM detects no air mass or insufficient air mass, a 
fault is stored in the ECM and the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) 
is activated. The mini HFM has a compact pipe shaped design 
with O-ring connections.

Exhaust Manifold 

The tubular stainless steel exhaust manifolds contain the familiar 
“near engine” catalytic converters. 

The manifolds also provide the mounting for the pre and post cata¬ 
lyst oxygen sensors. The manifold also has provisions for the 
exhaust gas temperature sensor. 


Charcoal Canister 

As the hydrocarbon vapors enter the canister, they will be absorbed 
by the active carbon. 

The remaining air will be vented to the atmosphere through the 
end of the canister, DM-TL and filter, allowing the fuel tank to 
“breath”. 



On-Board Refueling Vapor Recovery 

The ORVR system on the M5 is identical to the production E60. 
This system recovers and stores hydrocarbon fuel vapor that was 
previously released during refueling. Non ORVR vehicles vent fuel 
vapors from the tank venting line back to the filler neck and in many 
states reclaimed by a vacuum receiver on the filling station’s fuel 
pump nozzle. 

When refueling an ORVR eguipped vehicle, the pressure of the fuel 
entering the tank forces the hydrocarbon vapors through the larger 
tank vent line to the liquid / vapor separator, through the rollover 
valve and into the charcoal canister. The HC is stored in the char¬ 
coal canister, and the system can then “breath” through the DM-TL 
and the air filter. The vent line to the filler neck is smaller, but still 
necessary for checking the filler cap/neck during Evaporative Leak 
Testing. 


When the engine is running, the canister is "purged" using intake 
manifold vacuum to draw air through the canister which extracts the 
HC vapors into the combustion chamber. 

The Carbon Canister with DM-TL and air filter are located at the 
behind the right rear wheel.

Evaporative Emission Valve (Purge Valve) 

This ECM controlled solenoid valve regulates the purge flow from 
the Carbon Canister into the intake manifold. The ECM Relay pro¬ 
vides operating voltage, and the ECM controls the valve by regulat¬ 
ing the ground circuit. The valve is powered open and closed by an 
internal spring. 

If the Evaporative Emission Valve circuit is defective, a fault code 
will be set and the “Malfunction Indicator Light” will illuminate when 
the OBD II criteria is achieved. 

If the valve is “mechanically” defective, a driveability complaint 
could be encountered and a mixture related fault code will be set. 

Evaporative Leakage Detection (DM-TL) 

This component ensures accurate fuel system leak detection for 
leaks as small as 0.5 mm by slightly pressurizing the fuel tank and 
evaporative components. The DM-TL pump contains an integral 
DC motor which is activated directly by the ECM. The ECM 
monitors the pump motor operating current as the measurement 
for detecting leaks. 

The pump also contains an ECM controlled change over valve that 
is energized closed during a Leak Diagnosis test. The change over 
valve is open during all other periods of operation allowing the fuel 
system to “breath” through the inlet filter. The DM-TL pump is 
located behind the right rear wheel attached to the Carbon 
Canister. 

To prevent condensation buildup in the DM-TL pump, a heating 
element is integrated into the housing of the pump. The heating 
element is ground controlled by the ECM.

VANOS 

The VANOS used on the S85 is the “high-pressure” Bi-VANOS 
designed specifically for motorsport applications. The system is 
designed to allow for rapid and accurate camshaft timing changes. 
This is made possible due to a very high operating pressure. The 
operating pressure in this VANOS system is 115 bar. 

The VANOS system of the S85 consists of the following compo¬ 
nents: 

• Two VANOS actuating units (one for each bank) 

• Two sets of VANOS transmissions (one set for each bank) 


• High pressure radial piston pump 

• Pressure accumulator with solenoid valve 

• High pressure lines 

VANOS Actuating Unit 

The actuating unit consists of the adjustment pistons and solenoid 
valves. The adjustment pistons provide axial movement when oil 
pressure is applied. The solenoid valves, which are controlled by 
the ECM, direct oil flow to control piston movement.

VANOS Transmission 

The VANOS transmission contains the “helical” cut gearing to pro¬ 
vide the torsion or “twisting action” of the camshafts. The intake 
camshaft is driven by the primary chain drive from the crankshaft. 
The exhaust camshaft is driven by the gear-to-gear connection 
with the intake camshaft sprocket. 

The VANOS transmissions provide the minimum and maximum 
“spread angle” for the camshafts. The intake camshafts have a 
spread angle of 60° relative to the crankshaft, and the exhaust 
camshafts have a spread angle of 37° relative to the crankshaft. 

Due to the gear-to-gear connection between the intake and 
exhaust “sprockets”. The camshafts rotate in opposite directions. 
This means that the “retard” and “advance” movements are in dif¬ 
ferent directions between the intake and exhaust camshafts. 



Pressure Accumulator 

The pressure accumulator is pre-charged with nitrogen at a pres¬ 
sure of 40 bar. The oil chamber is separated from the gas chamber 
by a piston. The operating pressure of the VANOS is approximately 
70 bar. When the engine is switched off, the pressure accumulator 
valve on the VANOS accumulator closes. A pressure of approxi¬ 
mately 70 bar remains in the pressure accumulator and is immedi¬ 
ately available the next time the engine is started. This prevents 
the VANOS adjustment units from producing a clacking noise 
when the engine is started. 

Switching on and switching off conditions for the pressure accu¬ 
mulator valve: 

• Engine start: pressure accumulator valve OPEN 

• End of engine start: pressure accumulator valve CLOSED 

• Oil pressure in VANOS built up: pressure accumulator valve 
OPEN 

• Switch off the engine: pressure accumulator valve CLOSED

Pressure Accumulator Shut-off Valve (VANOS) 

The shut-off valve, which is controlled by the ECM, ensures that 
the high pressure engine oil remains in the pressure accumulator 
after turning off the engine. The valve is therefore closed when no 
power is applied and is opened on request by the DME (no propor¬ 
tional opening). 

Camshaft Sensors 

The hall-effect camshaft sensors are located on top of the valve 
cover. The provide the ECM with information regarding camshaft 
position. The sensors monitor trigger wheels which are integrally 
cast on the camshafts. 



Camshaft Trigger Wheels 

The trigger wheels for the camshaft sensors are integrally cast onto 
the camshafts. 















Power Button 

The POWER button is a provides a ground input to the ECM to 
allow selectivity of engine power output. The modes that can be 
selected with the button are P400 and P500. 

The P500 Sport mode which also selects a progressive accelerator 
pedal characteristic can be configured only in the "M-Drive" menu 
and selected via the "M" button on the multifunction steering 
wheel. 


The P400 setting is assumed automatically when the vehicle is 
restarted. 



The DME receives the ground input from the switch. The SZM is 
responsible for the illumination of the “On” LED. Switch illumina¬ 
tion is provided by the KL58g circuit.

Lubrication System 

The lubrication system on the S85 uses “lateral force compensa¬ 
tion”. This system is used to counteract the forces encountered 
during extreme cornering. This oiling system is unusually elaborate 
for a passenger car. 

There are a total of 4 oil pumps (not including one forVANOS), that 
supply the S85 engine with lubrication. Of the four oil pumps used 
for lubrication, two of them are mechanically driven from the crank¬ 
shaft by a chain drive. The other two oil pumps are electrically 
controlled by the ECM. 


Since the E60 M5 is capable of cornering forces in excess of 1 g, 
a potential for a loss of lubrication could be experienced. This 
extreme force will hold oil in the cylinder head on the cylinder bank 
which is on the outside of the turn which in turn could present the 
potential for oil starvation at the oil pump inlet. 

To prevent this, there are two electrically operated “duo-centric” 
oil pumps located on the left and right sides of the oil sump. The 
ECM receives lateral acceleration information from the Dynamic 
Stability Control via the PT-CAN connection. If the lateral accelera¬ 
tion exceeds 0.8g, the ECM activates two electric oil pumps which 
transport oil from the cylinder head to the main oil sump.

Oil Pressure Switch 

The oil pressure switch is a ground input to the ECM. The status 
of the oil pressure switch is evaluated in the ECM. Any deviations 
from the specified value will cause the ECM to send a correspon¬ 
ding message to the CID. An associated check control 
message will also be displayed. 

Oil Level Indicator 

The M5 is equipped with an electronic oil level indicator. The dis¬ 
play is selected with the BC control. 

The oil level is indicated in the information field of the on-board 
computer (BC) in the instrument cluster. 

The sensor is the quality and condition sensor (QLT) from the E65. 
The entire measurement logic is resident in the engine manage¬ 
ment (MS_S65) control unit. 


The long-term value last stored is shown after starting the engine. 

Basically there are two different measuring methods: 

• Long-term Measurement 

• Quick Measurement 

Long-Term Measurement 

The engine management permanently measures the oil level and 
derives the mean value from the measurement results which is 
then shown in the on-board computer. 

The ECM requires an engine operating time of approximately 
10 minutes to establish a long-term value. 

Note: The average speed information was removed from the 
BC menu to accommodate the oil level indication in 
the on-board computer.

Quick Measurement 

The quick measurement method provides the option of measuring 
the oil level with only a short time delay (e.g. topping up oil, oil serv¬ 
ice). 

The quick measurement must be initiated manually by pressing 
and holding the BC button (approximately 2 seconds) in the oil 
level indication setting. 

The displayed value indicates the quantity of oil above the mini¬ 
mum level. The value should be between MIN 0.0 I and MAX 1.0 I. 

Display: 1.5 I means overfilled, the bar indicator is additionally filled 
above Maximum. 


Perform Quick Measurement 

• Park vehicle in horizontal position 

• Engine running at idle speed 

• Oil temperature above 70°C 

• Select engine oil level indicator in on-board computer 

• Press and hold BC button > 2 seconds. 

The oil level display changes and shows only two dashes (see 
below) and a clock symbol. The clock symbol indicates that the oil 
level is being measured. The clock symbol would disappear if the 
engine speed is now increased. The measurement is continued as 
soon as the measurement criteria are met again. 

The pure measuring time is approximately 60 s. The long-term 
value last stored is deleted with initiation of the quick measure¬ 
ment.

Cooling System 

The cooling system on the S85 is not influenced by the ECM. In 
other words, the coolant thermostat is not electrically heated by 
the ECM. However, the ECM still provides control for the electric 
cooling fan as in past models. 

The cooling fan is controlled by the ECM through an output stage 
which receives a PWM signal. 


The ECM varies the PWM signal based on the following factors: 

• Coolant outlet temperature 

• Calculated (and measured) catalyst temperature 

• Vehicle speed 

• Battery voltage 

• Air conditioning inputs (such as AC pressure)
