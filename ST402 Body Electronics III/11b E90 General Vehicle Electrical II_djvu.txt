Control Units 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The Junction Box Electronics Control Module is the master for all wiper functions. 

The relays for the wipe/wash functions are installed in the JBE. The relay for the continu¬ 
ous wipe function in Stage 1 is plugged in and the relay for Stage 2 soldered to the PC 
board. 

A relay is installed in the Junction Box for the headlight washer system. 

Roof Functions Center (FZD) 

The Rain and Driving Lights Sensor is connected via LIN-Bus to the Roof Functions 
Center. 

Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

The Dynamic Stability Control makes available the vehicle speed signal and is the inter¬ 
face to the Steering Column Switch Cluster (SZL). 

Wiper Switch 

The wiper switch with the following functions is located in the steering column 
switch cluster: 

• Intermittent wipe 

• Stage 1 and Stage 2 

• Windscreen washer 

• Switch for rain and driving lights sensor 

• Indicator for active rain and driving lights sensor 

The wiper switch is an optical switch. The functions of the optical switch are described in 
the section entitled "Steering column switch cluster" later in this section. 

The interval switch is a four-stage switch. 

Each switch stage produces different input values in the steering column switch cluster 
SZL. The input values are evaluated, for example, for setting the sensitivity of the rain and 
driving lights sensor. 

The button for the rain and driving lights sensor is designed as a ground-switching but¬ 
ton. It is required to switch on the rain and driving lights sensor. The LED on the stalk 
switch is illuminated when the rain and driving lights sensor is activated. 

Wiper Motor 

The wiper motor is designed for two speed stages and has a reset contact. 

Pump for Windscreen Washer 

The washer fluid pumps for washing the windscreen are mounted on the washer fluid 
reservoir. The pump is activated directly by the Junction Box Electronics Control Module. 

9 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 




Pump for Headlight Washer 

A high pressure pump is used for the headlight washer system. The pump is activated by 
means of a relay in the junction box. 


Heated Water Jets 

Two heated water jets are used for the windscreen washer. The water jets feature a PTC 


resistor that limits the current intake itself.

Service Information 

Wipe/Wash System Emergency Operating Functions 
Steering Column Switch Cluster Failing 

The JBE recognizes failure of the steering column switch cluster by the absence of the 
"wipe switch operation" signal via the K-CAN. The JBE then switches over to emergency 
operating mode. 

Emergency operation consists of permanent wiper operation in stage 1. The wiper oper¬ 
ates constantly as from terminal R. It cannot be switched off until the fault has been recti¬ 
fied. If the steering column switch cluster SZL fails during wiper mode, the wiper will 
continue to operate for 11 s in the set wiper mode and then switches over to emergency 
operating mode. 

After emergency operating mode, the wiper is updated only after receiving a new mes¬ 
sage from the SZL and determining the wiper position via the reset contact. 

Rain and Lights Sensor Failing 

If the rain/driving lights sensor fails or is defective, the JBE undertakes the wiper control 
and switches to emergency operating mode. This emergency operating mode is an inter¬ 
mittent wipe mode dependent on the vehicle speed. 


10 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 






































Principles of Operation 

The wipe/wash system is switched on and off with the wiper switch. The wiper switch is 
an integral part of the steering column switch cluster (SZL). 

Wiper Switch 

The following functions are switched on with the wiper switch: 

• Automatic wipe with rain and lights sensor 

• Continuous wipe, Stage 1 

• Continuous wipe, Stage 2 

• Single wipe 

• Wash windscreen. 

The signals of the wipe switch are sent from the steering column switch cluster via the 
F-CAN to the dynamic stability control. The signal is then transferred from the dynamic 
stability control via the PT-CAN to the Junction Box Electronics Control Module. The 
Junction Box Electronics Control Module evaluates the signals and activates the wiper 
motor. 

Windscreen Wipe Function 

The following functions are available for wiping the windscreen: 

• Intermittent wipe in stages 

• Automatic Intermittent wipe 

• Continuous wipe, Stage 1 

• Continuous wipe, Stage 2 

• Single wipe. 

Intermittent Wipe 

The Intermittent wipe in stages only operates if the RLS system is defective. E90 will 
come with RLS standard. The interval can be set with the multi-stage switch. Four inter¬ 
mittent wipe stages are available. The time intervals depend on the set intermittent wipe 
stage and the vehicle speed. 

The Junction Box Electronics Control Module calculates the time intervals and activates 
the wiper motor accordingly. 


11 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 





Automatic Intermittent Wipe 

The automatic wipe function is activated by pressing the wiper stalk switch button at 
terminal R ON. When active, the "automatic wipe" function is indicated by the LED on 
the wiper switch. A single wipe cycle is additionally started.

Automatic interval switch w/LED 


Wiper Stalk Switch 

The rain and lights sensor sends a wipe reguest corresponding to the rain intensity. The 
roof functions center checks the rain and lights sensor every 20 ms to establish whether 
the wipe reguest applies. When the request is sent, the rain and lights sensor confirms 
this request via the LIN-bus. The roof functions center sends this request on the K-CAN. 

The Junction Box Electronics Control Module evaluates the request and activates the 
wiper motor accordingly. 

During the automatic wipe cycle, the wiper wiping frequency depends on the information 
provided by the rain and lights sensor and to vehicle speed. 

The control of the wipe/wash system is integrated in the Junction Box Electronics Control 
Module. 

Continuous Wipe Stage 1 

The wipe motor runs at normal speed when Stage 1 is switched on with the wiper 
switch. The wiper motor switches from continuous wipe in Stage 1 to intermittent wipe if 
the vehicle speed is reduced down to standstill. 

The continuous wipe function in Stage 1 resumes as soon as the vehicle speed is > 4 
km/h. 

Continuous Wipe Stage 2 

The wiper blades are moved at double the speed in continuous wipe Stage 2. When the 
vehicle is stationary, continuous wipe Stage 2 automatically switched back to continuous 
wipe Stage 1. The wiper blades then move at normal speed. 


12 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 










■ Single Wipe 

By pressing down the wiper switch, the flick wipe function is triggered for as long as the 
switch is pressed. On releasing the wiper switch, the wiper movement is completed to 
the park position of the wiper blades. 

Wash Functions 

The E90 features a specific wash function for the windscreen. The function is operated 
via the wiper switch. 

Wash Windscreen 

On pulling the wiper switch, initially the washer fluid pump is switched on followed by the 
windscreen wiper. The washer fluid pump remains switched on for as long as the wiper 
switch is pulled. 

The signal is routed from the SZL to the Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE). 

The JBE activates the washer fluid pump directly. After the pump is switched off, the 
wipers continue to operate for several wipe cycles in order to wipe the windscreen dry. 

The JBE will no longer drive the washer fluid pump if the fluid level in the washer fluid 
reservoir is too low. The JBE receives the information necessary for this purpose from the 
washer fluid level sensor. 

Washer Fluid Level Sensor 

The junction box monitors the washer fluid level sensor as from terminal R ON. 

The Junction Box Electronics Control Module receives a low signal when the washer fluid 
reservoir is full. The switch opens when the fluid level in the washer fluid reservoir drops 
below a certain level. The low signal changes to a high signal. 

The Junction Box Electronics Control Module consequently generates a message indi¬ 
cating the low level in the washer fluid reservoir. 

Terminal 50 

The washer function is interrupted or not at all started while the vehicle is started. 

If the windscreen washer function was interrupted, the started function is continued after 
the vehicle start procedure has been completed. 


13 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



Headlight Washer System 

The headlight washer system is switched on during the first wash cycle after terminal R 
ON and lights ON. Activation is then suppressed for 7 min. The headlight washer system 
is activated if the windscreen washer system is operated 5 times within the 7 minutes. 

In response to the request from the Junction Box Electronics Control Module, the head¬ 
light washer system is switched on by means of a relay in the junction box. 

The headlight washer system is no longer activated if the washer fluid level in the washer 
fluid reservoir is too low. The Junction Box Electronics Control Module receives the cor¬ 
responding signal from the washer fluid level sensor. 

The headlight washer system is not activated when blocking of the wipers is detected. 

Heated Water Jets 

The water jets can be heated as from terminal 15 ON. The Junction Box Electronics 
Control Module activates the water jet heating system via two separate outputs. 

Activation is dependent on the outside temperature and whether the windscreen wipers 
are switched on. The Junction Box Electronics Control Module calculates the operating 
time of the water jets. The clock frequency for activation is 1 Hz.

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 


















Park Distance Control 


On the E90, Park Distance Control (PDC) is a distance warning system that provides 
both visual and audible information on the distance to the nearest obstacle when parking 
and driving out of spaces. 

The distance to the nearest obstacle is measured by the four sensors in the rear bumper. 

The distance is signalled audibly via the speakers in the rear of the vehicle. Signal tones 
increase as the distance to the obstacle decreases. 

A permanent tone signal is output when vehicle is in close proximity to obstacles. The 
signal tones are produced and output by means of the existing audio system (RAD2 or 
CCC). 

When the vehicle is eguipped with navigation, the graphic distance signalling is shown 
on the Central Information Display (CID). 

The PDC can be switched on and off by means of a button in the center console Switch 
Cluster (SZM). 

The following changes/new features have been implemented compared to the prede¬ 
cessor models: 

• Different speaker configurations (corresponding to eguipment). 

System Components 

The following components are involved in the PDC system: 

• PDC control unit 

• Four Ultrasonic Sensors 

• Audio system (RAD2 or CCC w/speakers)

Ultrasonic Sensors 

The sensors used on the E90 offer additional benefits: 

Larger Range 

The range of the new sensor is approximately 250 cm. The entire range of the sensors is 
used for visual distance signalling. The converter range is reduced to 150 cm at the rear 
for audible distance signalling. 


Optimized Design 

The length of the sensors in the E90 are approx. 50% of the previous sensor, which 
results in a reduced housing depth of the sensor. Due to the new design, the sensor is 
not decoupled in the component. The decoupling ring does not serve as a seal. 

The installation of the decoupling ring is essential and ensures trouble-free operation.

Principles of Operation 


Ultrasonic Sensors 

The Ultrasonic Sensors operate based on the echo-sounding principle. 

Send Mode 

The ultrasonic sensor behaves as a "speaker" in send mode. 

By triggering electric pulses, the electronic circuitry of the ultrasonic sensor causes the 
piezoelectric crystal located on the inside of the outer diaphragm to move (conversion of 
electrical energy to mechanical energy). 

The outer diaphragm vibrates in line with the resonance frequency and produces ultra¬ 
sonic waves. The short pulse sequences (12 sinusoidal oscillations) hit an obstacle and 
are reflected. 

Receive Mode 

The ultrasonic sensor behaves as a "microphone" in receive mode. 

After the outer diaphragm has settled (~1 ms), the ultrasonic sensor receives the ultra¬ 
sonic waves reflected by the obstacle. 

The outer diaphragm and the piezoelectric crystal oscillate and send the electrical pulses 
to the electronic circuitry of the ultrasonic sensor (conversion of mechanical energy to 
electrical energy).

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 


















































Control Unit 

The electrically measured signal is digitized and transferred to the control unit, which 
processes the data to establish the distance to the obstacle is calculated. 

Echo propagation time is calculated from the send start time and the time the incoming 
echo is received. Based on the known ultrasonic speed, the echo propagation time is a 
measure for the distance to the obstacle. 

Activating System 

The PDC must be switched on, by engaging reverse gear, in order to activate the dis¬ 
tance signalling function. 

The PDC receives the signal information via the K-CAN: 

• Manual transmission vehicles - the Footwell Module reads the signal from the 
gearshift lever and makes it available via the K-CAN 

• On automatic transmission vehicles - the automatic transmission control unit sends 
the signal via the PT-CAN to the Junction Box Electronics Control Module, which 
makes the signal available via the K-CAN. 

The PDC can also be activated by means of the button in the center console switch clus¬ 
ter. The signal from the button is received by the IHKA which transmits it via the K-CAN 
to the PDC. 

Audible Distance Signaling 

The distance is signalled audibly by means of the audio system, which receives the dis¬ 
tance signals from the PDC via the K-CAN. 

Both the RAD2 and the CCC make it possible to distinguish between left and right. 

Visual Distance Signaling 

Visual distance signaling can be displayed on the CID if the vehicle is equipped with a 
Car Communication Computer (CCC).

Footwell Module (FRM) 

The Footwell Module (FRM) is the master control module for all exterior lighting func¬ 
tions. 

All exterior light systems (headlights and side/parklights) are switched on and off via the 
light switch. Information to turn the lights on or off is supplied from the light switch 
directly to the FRM. 

The SZL directly provides information to flash headlights, activate high beams or activate 
turn signal indicators to the FRM via a hard wired connection for this stalk. 

In the “automatic” driving lights setting, the FRM indirectly receives information for 
switching the vehicle lighting on/off from the Rain Lights Sensor (RLS). 

Signal path: RLS via LIN-BUS to FZD; FZD via K-CAN to FRM to headlights. 

The hazard light switch is connected directly to the FRM. 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The Junction Box Electronics Control Module provides a pass-through function for the 
signals from the SZL, which are transmitted on the F-CAN to the DSC module. 

Junction Box (JB) 

The power to the FRM is supplied from the Junction Box 

Car Access System 2 (CAS2) 

The Car Access System provides ignition switch information to the FRM 

Roof Function Center (FZD) 

The Roof Function Center transfers/routes the information from the RLS to the FRM via 
the K-CAN. The RLS provides information to activate/deactivate the headlights based on 
the level of exterior brightness. 

Ultrasonic Passenger Compartment Protection Sensor (USIS) 

If the alarm system is installed (Center installed accessory), in the event of a triggered 
alarm, a request is sent to the FRM to trigger a visual alarm by flashing the lights. 

Flashing of the lights in association with arming and disarming the alarm system can be 
set as part of the vehicle memory/individualization function using the diagnostic equip¬ 
ment. 

Multiple Restraint System (MRS5) 

In the event of a crash the MRS5 sends a request to the FRM to activate the hazard 
lights and illuminate the interior lights

on the ambient lighting conditions (tunnel, twilight, rain or snow). The function is activat¬ 
ed by having the light switch in the Auto headlamp position. 

In the event of a malfunction with the RLS the FRM will illuminate the headlamps. 

NOTE: The automatic headlamp control cannot serve as a substitute for per¬ 
sonal judgement in determining when the lamps should be illuminated. 
As an example the system can not detect fog and should be activated 
manually. 

On vehicles equipped with iDrive the sensitivity of the lighting activation point can be 
adjusted by selecting Vehicle Settings - Lighting - Auto Headlamps. 

Fog Light 

Foglights are activated by pressing the foglight button; side/park lights or low beam head¬ 
lamps must be illuminated in order to activate the foglamps. 

Directional Indicators 

The front and rear turn signal indicators are activated via the turn signal stalk on the SZL, 
an optical switch. 

A defective bulb in the front or rear indicator lights will result in the remaining lights flash¬ 
ing at double the normal rate. If a repeated light is defective this will have no impact on 
flash rate. 

The one touch function will flash/activate the indicators lights three times. The function 
can be modified via personal profile/individualization/vehicle memory. 

Hazard Lights 

The hazard lights are activated by depressing the hazard light switch located in the center 
of the dash. The turn signal indicators have priority if the hazard flashers were activated 
first. The hazard flashers have priority if the turn signal indicators are active first. 


25 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



















If equipped with an alarm system the hazard lights are flashed for up to 6 minutes if an 
alarm is triggered and the alarm is not switched off. The FRM receives the request 
via the K-CAN from the USIS module. 

The FRM provides information to the instrument cluster via the K-CAN to activate the 
audible indicator as well as the visual indicator. 

Upon activation of the central locking function CAS2 supplies a signal to the FRM via K- 
CAN to flash the hazard lights to indicate that the vehicle is locked. The visual feedback 
can be deactivated in the personal profile/vehicle memory settings. 

Tail Lights/License Plate Lights 

In the event of a malfunction the lamps in the brake light chambers are used as a substi¬ 
tute for the taillight. The bulbs are dimmed by means of a PWM signal in order to provide 
a substitute tail light operation. 

Brake Lights & Brake Force Display 

The brake light switch is power by a 5V signal from the CAS2, with terminal R ON. 

• Brake force display is standard on the E90 and is activated 

• Speed > 5 Km/h 

• Brake deceleration above 5 m/s 2 

Reverse Lights 

On vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission, the signal for activating the reverse 
light is obtained by the FRM from the EGS module via PT-CAN. On vehicles equipped 
with a manual transmission the FRM obtains the signal from the reverse gear switch. 

Lamp Monitoring 

The Footwell Module (FRM) monitors all of the exterior lighting system with the lights 
switched on or off, as long as terminal 15 is active. 

Cold Monitoring with Lights OFF 

Cold monitoring is based on measuring the current of the individual lamp outputs. The 
current pulse used for measurement purposes is so short that the lamps are not illumi¬ 
nated. The FRM evaluates the individual lamp outputs to establish whether there is a line 
break or a lamp bulb is defective. 

The number of current pulses is increased significantly during the first 4 s after terminal 
15 ON to check whether the lamps are in working order before setting off. This function 
is referred to as the pre-drive check. The number of pulses is then reduced after the pre¬ 
drive check. Power is then applied to the lamps every 1.5 minutes. 

The raised (3rd) brake light is not included in the cold monitoring system. The LEDs of 
the brake lamp react too fast to the current pulse and would consequently light up. 

The bi-xenon headlight is also not included in the cold monitoring. Legal regulations pro¬ 
hibit the current pulse to the bi-xenon headlight. 

26 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



Hot Monitoring with Lights ON 

Hot monitoring is based on measuring the current of the individual lamp outputs. The 
lamp current is used to detect an overload or interruption (break). 

Pathway/Follow Me Home Lighting 

The lighting feature is activated byway of the headlight flasher position on the SZL stalk. 

Bi Xenon Headlights 

The Bi Xenon headlights are only installed on the E90 in conjunction with the Adaptive 
Headlight Control System.

Adaptive Headlight Control 


In conjunction with the Bi-Xenon headlights an Adaptive Headlight control system is also 
included on the E90. 

The function of the Adaptive Headlight Control system is to provide an enhanced light¬ 
ing path as the vehicle travels through a turn, plus reduce the risk of excessive glare to 
on coming traffic. The adaptive headlight control allows the headlights to rotate slightly 
as the front wheels turn.

Car Access System 2 (CAS2) 

The Car Access System 2 provides ignition switch information to the FRM. 


Footwell Module (FRM) 

The control for the Adaptive Headlight is incorporated into the Footwell Module. 

The FRM is connected to: 

• K-CAN 

• PT-CAN 

• LIN-bus. 

Note: The FRM is not a gateway for the PT-CAN, however, it does serve as a 
gateway between K-CAN and LIN-bus. 

The FRM can receive data via the PT-CAN as well as the K-CAN and LIN-Bus, however 
it only transmits data via K-CAN and LIN-Bus. 

In the event that the FRM is replaced the VIN must be entered and the module coded to 
the vehicle plus an adaptation process must be completed or the Complete adaptive 
headlight control function will not be active. 

Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

The dynamic stability control sends signals relating to the yaw rate and vehicle speed to 
the FRM for the operation of the Adaptive Headlight Control function 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The signals that are sent via the F-CAN pass-through the JBE, making it possible to 
transmit the steering angle data from the steering column switch cluster to the FRM. 

Signal Path: Steering angle sensor in SZL via F-CAN to DSC; DSC to FRM via PT-CAN 

Rain and Light Sensor (RLS) 

The rain and light sensor is incorporated in the base of the rearview mirror. The signals 
from the RLS are used to switch on the automatic driving lights and activate the Adaptive 
Headlight Control function in the FRM. 

Roof Function Center (FZD) 

The Roof Functions Center is the gateway for the RLS, and transfers the LIN-Bus signal 
of the RLS via the K-CAN to the FRM. 

Ultrasonic Passenger-Compartment Protection Sensor (USIS) 

The USIS transmits the signal for the visual alarm of the anti-theft alarm system via the K- 
CAN to the FRM. 

Multiple Restraint System 5 (MRS5) 

The MRS5 supplies a signal to the FRM in the event of a crash. 


33 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



Additional Components of Adaptive Headlight Control 


Bi-Xenon Headlight 

The bi-xenon headlight control unit is mounted on the bi-xenon headlight and supplies 
the power and ignition voltage for the bi-xenon light bulb which is integrated in the swivel 
section of the adaptive headlight. 

The zero position Hall sensor registers the zero position of the swivel module and the 
stepper motor provides the swivel movement of the swivel module. 

A separate stepper motor is installed for the headlight vertical aim control. 

The headlight can be replaced, however headlight-specific coding is necessary for the 
respective stepper motor controller. If this adaptation is not performed, the function will 
appear to operate, but not correctly. 

The swivel range and zero point can vary from vehicle model to vehicle model and the bi¬ 
xenon headlight can have a different status! The headlights must be adjusted and 
checked. 

Stepper Controller 

The stepper motor controller is mounted on the side of the bi-xenon headlight and con¬ 
trols/monitors the movement of the stepper motors for the adaptive headlight and the ver¬ 
tical aim control function. 

The component can be replaced, however after replacing the stepper motor controllers, it 
is necessary to store the vehicle identification number and enter headlight related coding 
in the stepper motor controllers. 

The complete adaptive headlight function will not be operative without this adaptation. 
Particular care must be taken when replacing the stepper motor controllers to ensure that 
the housing gasket of the stepper motor controller is fitted and seals correctly. 

Directional Indicator/High Beam Switch 

The SZL contains the direction indicator/high beam switch and provides this signal 
directly to the FRM via a hard-wired connection. 

DSC Sensor 

The DSC Sensor provides information pertaining to the yaw of the vehicle about the verti¬ 
cal axis 

Rotation Rate Sensor 

The rotation rate sensors supply the signals for the vehicle speed via DSC to the FRM. 


34 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



Steering Angle Sensor 

The Steering Angle Sensor is integrated in the SZL, is an optical sensor, and makes avail¬ 
able data relating to the steering wheel angle. 

Front and Rear Ride-Height Sensors 

The ride-height sensors are installed on the front and rear axle. 

The signals of the ride-height sensors are used for the headlight vertical aim control and 
are evaluated by the FRM. 

Brake Pedal Switch 

The signal of the brake pedal switch is used by the FRM to adjust for the headlight verti¬ 
cal aim control. 

Diagnosis Mode 

The adaptive headlight must be set to diagnosis mode for following diagnosis tasks: 

• Read out of relevant bus signals with vehicle stationary 

- Road speed 

- Yaw rate 

- Steering angle 

• Checking signal plausibility 

• Checking that conditions for activation are fulfilled 

- Rain and light sensor status 

- Light switch status. 

Missing or non-plausible BUS signals are stored in the form of fault codes in the 
FRM. The fault types are stored in the stepper motor controller. 

The stepper motor controller is accessed via the FRM. 

Note: If headlight rotation function is being checked while vehicle is 
standing still the headlight will only rotate to the right. 


35 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



Headlight Rotation 

In order for the headlights to rotate slightly as the front wheels are turned, a stepper 
motor is incorporated into the headlight assembly/swivel module. The FRM controls the 
amount of rotation based on the following information: 

• Steering angle 

• Road speed 

• Yaw rate.

s 


Under normal driving conditions up to a speed of approx. 40 km/h, the adaptive headlight 
is controlled by the data from the steering angle sensor. 

The information from the yaw rate sensor is included in the calculation for headlight rota¬ 
tion: 


• At speeds greater than approx. 40 km/h 

• In the event of vehicle oversteering or understeering 

• A vehicle tending to yaw. 

The adaptive headlight rotation function is deactivated in the event an oversteering, 
understeering or yawing condition is detected by means of the steering angle sensor and 
the yaw rate sensor. If the adaptive headlight function is deactivated the stepper 
motor/swivel module returns to its zero position. 


36 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 








In normal operation the Adaptive Headlight Control function allows the front headlight to 
rotate slightly as the vehicle moves through turns.

Steering Angle 


The transition point of light/dark must be above the center line of travel when the vehicle 
is in a turn to reduce the risk reduce the risk of excessive glare to on coming traffic. 


It is the responsibility of the stepper motor controller based on information received from 
the FRM via LIN-Bus, to control and monitor the stepper motors of each headlight plus 
the vertical aim control of the respective bi-xenon headlight. 


The stepper motor controller performs the following functions: 

• Receiving and evaluating the data sent from the FRM via the LIN-bus: 
- Reference run 


-Target position commands 
- Diagnosis requests 

• Output control of the stepper motors 

• Zero position acquisition of swivel module 

• Reference run of swivel module 

• Position feedback of swivel module to footwell module 

• Diagnosis 

• Feedback of diagnosis data to the footwell module. 

The FRM in its function as the central control unit for the adaptive headlight sends sig¬ 
nals to the stepper motor controllers every 20 ms.

Classroom Exercise - Review Questions 

What module is responsible for the Adaptive Headlight Control function? 



2. What is the purpose of Adaptive Headlight Control? 


3. What signals/information are required for the operation of the Adaptive Headlight 
Control function? 


42 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 


















Steering Column Switch Cluster 


The functions of the Steering Column Switch Cluster (SZL) are: 

• Detecting steering angle and steering speed 

• Detecting the controls in the multifunction steering wheel (MFL) 

• Detecting switching signals in the steering column switches 

• Sending and receiving information to/from the interlinked control modules. 

Components of the SZL

NOTE: The steering column switch cluster SZL can only be replaced as a com¬ 
plete unit. The coil spring assembly is installed on the steering column 
switch cluster which can be removed and individually replaced. 


43 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 





















The Electronic Steering Column Switch Cluster module contains a processor, power sup¬ 
ply and the following interfaces: 

• F-CAN 

• Optical switches 

• Electrical switches. 

The optical sensor for measuring the steering angle is integrated in the pc-board of the 
control module. 

F-CAN Link 

The DSC control module is connected via the F-CAN to the SZL and serves as the gate¬ 
way for the SZL, allowing data from the SZL to be distributed to the other control mod¬ 
ules. 

All diagnosis functions take place via the DSC control module. 

There is no fault code memory in the SZL, since the SZL cannot communicate directly 
with the BMW diagnosis system. 

Detection of Steering Angle and Steering Speed 

The steering column switch cluster must detect the steering angle and steering speed 
information as the basis for calculating various functions in the DSC. Additional informa¬ 
tion such as the absolute steering angle or the steering wheel rotation information is cal¬ 
culated by the SZL 



The optical steering angle sensor is able to detect a steering angle of -180°/+180°. 

In order to measure the steering angle a “code”' disc rotates as the steering wheel is 
rotated. An LED and fibre optics unit illuminate the code disc from above and based on 
the pattern on the code disc, the light from above reaches the bottom receiver/camera 
only in certain areas. The light pulses received by the receiving unit are converted to 
electrical pulses by the sensor. 

The pattern (1) on the disc changes in 2° increments, by evaluating the linear track (2) 
the steering angle can be defined to 0.1 ° 

44 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 
















































As the steering wheel is rotated the information contained in the pattern on the code disc 
(1) as well as the on linear track (2) changes. The changing information is “decoded” by 
the optical receiver and converted to electrical pulses to define the angle that the steering 
wheel has been rotated.Relative steering angle (±180°) 

Steering Wheel Rotation Decoded Data of Optical Receiver 


1= Pattern on Code Disc 2=LinearTrack 



Relative Steering Angle (+/- 180°) 

The relative steering angle indicates the angle position of the steering wheel. The infor¬ 
mation relating to the relative steering angle is always retained even when power to the 
control module is disconnected. Renewed zero point adjustment/ calibration is neces¬ 
sary only after the steering column switch cluster SZL has been replaced. DSC module is 
reprogrammed/replaced or after competing any repairs on the steering wheel/ steering 
column. 

Absolute Steering Angle 

The absolute steering angle is a calculation based on the relative steering angle and 
steering wheel rotation information. The absolute and relative steering angle are defined 
during the zero point adjustment of the steering column switch cluster. The SZL detects 
each position of the steering wheel over the entire steering lock range. The precondition 
before any zero point adjustment procedure is that the wheels and steering wheel are set 
in the straight-ahead position. 

45 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



































































Detecting the Controls of Multifunction Steering Wheel 

The voltage signals of the buttons on the multifunction steering wheel are routed via the 
coil spring to the SZL. The SZL evaluates the voltage signals and sends the information 
to the corresponding control units. 

The connections of the Steptronic switches, horn and the driver airbag are wired directly 
via the coil spring to the corresponding control units. This information is therefore not 
evaluated in the SZL. 

Detecting the signals of the steering column switches Optical switches are used in con¬ 
nection with the steering column stalks on the E90. Optical sensors detect the stalk posi¬ 
tion and makes this information available to the SZL. 

Direction Indicator/High Beam Switch 

The signals of the direction indicator and high beam switch are monitored by the SZL 
and transferred via three voltage-coded lines to the FRM. Only information relating to the 
switch positions is transmitted. 

The signals of the on-board computer button and the rocker switch are transferred via a 
line from the SZL to the Instrument Cluster. 

The functions in the respective switch positions are defined in the control modules. 

Wiper Switch 

The signals of the wiper switch are calculated directly in the SZL and transferred via the 
F-CAN to the DSC and to the Junction Box Electronics Control Module 

Cruise Control Switch 

The signals for the DCC or ACC systems are made available to the LDM. The data is 
transmitted via the F-CAN to the DSC. From the DSC the data are forwarded via the PT- 
CAN to the LDM. 

Signal Flow 

The acguired and calculated data of the SZL are mainly transferred via the F-CAN to the 
corresponding control module. 

The information for diagnosis is therefore also transferred via the F-CAN to the DSC. The 
DSC establishes the communication interface with the BMW diagnosis system. The SZL 
cannot be addressed directly via the BMW diagnosis system. 

The DSC must be coded after replacing the steering column switch cluster. The coding 
data is then transferred from the DSC to the SZL. 


46 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



Steering Column Switches 

The settings of all steering column stalks are determined optically. 

Function 

Depending on the steering column stalk, there are three or four LEDs on the outside and 
one optical receiver (LDR light-dependent resistor) on the inside of the steering column 
housing of the steering column stalk. A shutter is provided on the steering column stalk 
which, when in rest position, is located between the center LED and the LDR. As a 
result, the shutter blanks out the light of the center LED when in rest position.

As soon as the steering column stalk is moved, the shutter moves up or down and one of 
the outer LEDs is covered. The LEDs are never activated together but always clocked 
one after the other. In this way, the electronic SZL module can detect which LED is cur¬ 
rently blanked out. The function can be monitored by measuring the current at the LED. 

The data from the buttons and thumbwheels in the steering column switches is convert¬ 
ed to a voltage signal and either routed to the SZL and distributed to the corresponding 
control modules (wiper switch - JBE) or forwarded directly to other control modules (Turn 
indicators/high beam - FRM). 


47 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 

























Coil Spring Assembly 

The coil spring assembly can be replaced only as a complete unit. The task of the coil 
spring is to transmit the following electrical signals from and to the multifunction steering 
wheel: 


• Activation of driver airbag 

• Control buttons for SMG function (Not 
available at Launch) 

• Multifunction buttons 

• Horn 

Locking 

To avoid damaging the coil spring assem¬ 
bly, it must be set to the correct position 
when dismantling the steering wheel and 
coil spring assembly. 



The front wheels and steering wheel must be set to the straight-ahead position as the 
prerequisite for disassembly. During disassembly of the steering wheel, the load on the 
lock pin of the coil spring assembly is relieved and the pin can lock in the straight ahead 
position. 


When the steering wheel is reinstalled, this arrangement ensures that the coil spring is 
not damaged when the steering wheel is turned to full left and right lock.

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



















Outside Mirror 


The following outside mirror functions are possible: 

• Mirror adjustment in up/down and left/right directions 

• Mirror heating 

• Mirror folding function 

• Electrochromatic mirror 

• Outside mirror with memory function 

• Automatic parking function 

• Manual adjustment 

• Motor protection by repeat interlock. 


Mirror Adjustment 


The driver's door switch cluster is connected via the LIN-bus to the Footwell Module 
(FRM). 

The mirror adjustment switch in the driver's door switch cluster is converted into a LIN- 
bus message. 

The FRM checks the status of the driver's door switch cluster every 20 ms. The mirror 
adjustment switch sends a signal to the electronic module in the driver's door switch 
cluster which is then forwarded via the LIN-bus to the FRM. 


To protect the mirror drive unit, the mirror adjustment is limited to a maximum activation 
time of 10 s. Activation is maintained within this period of 10 s until the mirror adjust¬ 
ment switch is released. Activation is also maintained until the outside mirror blocks or 
reaches its end position. 


Detecting Position of Outside Mirrors 

The outside mirrors have two potentiometers for mirror adjustment, each potentiometer 
receives a 5 V supply from the electronic mirror module. The defined values of each 
potentiometer is stored in the FRM for the memory function. 

Mirror Heating 

The mirror heating is activated with of terminal 15 ON, by the FRM and the correspond¬ 
ing information is passed on to the electronic mirror module via the LIN-bus. 

The Instrument Cluster makes available the outside temperature value via the K-CAN. 
The Junction Box Electronics Control Module provides the information for the wipers via 
the K-CAN. 


55 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 





The percentage of switch-on time is calculated from both values in the FRM.

The percentage of increase is retained for 300 s after the wiper is switched off. 

The maximum electric heating output is 18 W that is set by means of voltage and current 
measurement in the mirror. 

Undervoltage 

The electronic mirror module switches off the mirror heating in the event of undervoltage, 
which has a positive effect on the charge balance of the battery. The cutout threshold is 
at 10.8 V. 

The electronic mirror module switches on the mirror heating again once a voltage of 
11.6 V is provided. 

Terminal 50 

During the start procedure, the starter outputs the "terminal 50 ON" status and the mirror 
heating is switched off during this period of time. 

Mirror Folding Function 

The folding function is controlled by the Footwell Module (FRM). When the mirror folding 
switch is pressed, the driver's door switch cluster evaluates the request and transfers it to 
the FRM. 

The FRM receives the request via the LIN-bus. Both outside mirrors are folded in 
towards the vehicle thus reducing the vehicle width. 

The outside mirror folding function is also possible in connection with the convenient 
closing function. The outside mirrors are activated at the same time as the rear power 
windows. The Car Access System 2 provides the signal necessary for this purpose. 

Electrochromatic Outside Mirrors 

The automatic dip function of the outside mirrors is dependent on the setting of the inte¬ 
rior rear-view mirror. The function is available with terminal 15 ON. 

The interior rear-view mirror sends the request to dip the mirrors to the Roof Functions 
Center via the LIN-bus. In turn, the Roof Functions Center makes the request available 
on the K-CAN. The FRM sends this request via the LIN-bus to the outside mirrors. 

The electronic mirror module controls the dip function of the outside mirrors. 


56 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 


























Outside Mirror with Memory Function 

The outside mirror features a memory function that is stored in the FRM. Three memory 
locations are available for this purpose: They are: 

• Current position when leaving the vehicle 

• Memory position of memory button 1 

• Memory position of memory button 2 

Remote Control 

Up to three personalizable remote controls are possible per vehicle. 

When the vehicle is locked using the remote control, the current mirror position is stored 
in the memory location for the key memory of the remote control currently used. As a 
result, the mirror position last set, referred to the remote control used, is always reas¬ 
sumed when the vehicle is unlocked. 

Storing Memory Position 

The position of the outside mirrors is stored in the FRM by pressing the "M" button fol¬ 
lowed by pressing one of the memory buttons within 7 s. The driver's seat module eval¬ 
uates the memory buttons and sends this information via the K-CAN. 

Calling up Memory Position 

When the memory button is pressed, the driver's seat module receives the request to 
adjust the outside mirrors to the memory position. 

The driver's seat module sends this request on the K-CAN. The FRM evaluates the 
request and activates the memory position. 

Automatic Parking Function 

The outside mirror on the front passenger's side is swivelled downward when reverse 
gear is engaged so that the curb can be easily viewed. The automatic parking function is 
activated under following conditions: 

• Terminal 15 ON and 

• Reverse gear signal 

• Mirror selector switch set to driver position 

• Towing hitch must not be active. 

Manual Gearbox 

The FRM receives the signal via the reverse gear switch. This switch refers to ground 
and sends out a low signal when reverse gear is engaged. 

Automatic Gearbox 

The FRM receives the signal via the K-CAN. The automatic transmission control unit 
then makes this signal available. 

57 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



Folding Mirror Manually 

The outside mirrors can be folded in or out manually. The mirrors could loose their set 
position when folded in or out manually. It may be necessary to repeat the fold-in/fold-out 
function for the mirrors to find the set position. 

Motor Protection by Repeat Interlock 

The outside mirrors feature a repeat inhibit function to avoid thermal overheating by fre¬ 
quently folding the mirrors in and out. The motors cannot be activated for 180 s when 
the repeat inhibit is active. 

Components of Outside Mirror Function 

The following components are installed in the E90 for the purpose of operating the out¬ 
side mirrors: 

• Driver's door switch cluster with 

- Outside mirror adjustment switch 

- Outside mirror selector switch 

- LIN-bus link 

• Outside mirrors 

• Footwell Module 

• Junction Box Electronics Control Module 

• Components for comfort/convenience function 

- Car Access System 2 

- Lock cylinder, driver's door 

- Remote control receiver in interior rearview mirror 

Driver's Door Switch Cluster 

In connection with the Low outside mirror, the adjustment motors are connected directly 
to the driver's door switch cluster. 

In connection with the High outside mirror, the adjustment motors are connected via the 
electronic mirror module. 

The electronic mirror module is connected via the LIN-bus to the driver's door switch 
cluster. 

The driver's door switch cluster is connected via the LIN-bus to the FRM and therefore 
also to the vehicle electrical system.

Seat Heating 


Seat Heating Module 

The seat heating is operable as from terminal 15 ON. The junction box control unit 
determines what type of seat module is installed in the vehicle. It sends a corresponding 
query via the K-CAN for this purpose. Since the seat heating module is not connected to 
the K-CAN, only the driver's seat module with memory function can respond to the 
query. The junction box control unit must register a response within 200 ms. If the 
response fails, the junction box control unit undertakes control of the seat heating sys¬ 
tem. 

On vehicles with a seat heating module, the junction box is responsible for converting 
the K-CAN telegram with switch information to a PWM signal for the seat heating mod¬ 
ule. The seat heating module activates the seat heating systems corresponding to the 
setting. 

The seat heating function is available as from terminal 15 ON and activation of the seat 
heating module. The seat heating module is connected to terminal 30 for the load cur¬ 
rent. 

After the seat heating button has been pressed, the center console switch cluster routes 
the request to the automatic climate control system. As a link element, it sends the 
requests via the K-CAN to the junction box control unit. In turn, the junction box control 
unit sends a pulse width-modulated signal to the seat control unit. The pulse width 
depends on the required heating output stage. 

The control unit receives the PWM signal corresponding to the temperature setting for 
the seat heating module. The seat heating module regulates the seat heating to the 
temperature specified by the junction box control unit. 

The seat heating module determines the temperature by means of an NTC resistor in 
the heating mat of the seat cushion. 

Seat Module, Driver's Side 

The driver's seat module is connected to the K-CAN on vehicles with memory function. 
The driver's seat module evaluates the telegrams with the switch information and corre¬ 
spondingly controls the seat heating. The driver's seat module determines the set tem¬ 
perature by means of the NTC resistor in the heating mat of the seat cushion. A fault in 
the seat heating system results in a corresponding entry in the fault code memory of the 
driver's seat module. 


64 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 




Settings 


Seat 

With the exception of the driver's seat module with memory function, the seat settings 
are implemented directly via the seat adjustment switches. Adjustment is possible as 
from terminal 30. The blocking detection function for the motors is located in the junction 
box control unit. For this purpose, the motor current is registered and motor blocking is 
detected above a defined current threshold. 

Driver's Seat Module with Memory Function 

The seat adjustment switches are also read directly in connection with the driver's seat 
module with memory function but in this case by the driver's seat module with memory 
function itself. The seat adjustment switches supply a defined voltage corresponding to 
the request. Based on these voltage values, the driver's seat module determines what 
motor it must activate. Activation takes place via the relay in the driver's seat module until 
the seat adjustment switch is released or the end of the adjustment range is reached. 

The Hall sensors in the adjustment motors supply Hall pulses which are evaluated by the 
driver's seat module with memory function. The seat position is determined based on 
the Hall pulses. This function is used not only to detect the end stops but also to store 
the memory position of the driver's seat. 

Blocking of a motor is detected by means of the current measurement function integrat¬ 
ed in the driver's seat module. In this case, the relays are no longer actuated thus shut¬ 
ting down the motors. The memory setting for this motor is inhibited until the motor is no 
longer blocked. 

Lumbar Support 

The lumbar support setting supports the spinal column and provides a more relaxed 
seating position for driving. The lumbar support function was adopted from the E46 and 
adapted to the seat of the E90. 

Backrest Width 

The backrest width adjustment is available only in connection with the sports seat. The 
function is located in the electronic circuitry in the valve block for the backrest width 
adjustment. The width of the backrest can be adjusted as from terminal 30. 

When the backrest width adjustment switch is pressed to reduce the width of the back¬ 
rest, the electronic circuitry in the valve block receives a low signal and correspondingly 
control the pressure control valves. 

At the same time, the pump motor is activated and fills the two backrest width cushions 
on the left and right in the backrest. 

To widen the backrest width, the pressure control valves are activated and the backrest 
width cushions are emptied. 


65 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical II 



Memory Function 

The memory function for the driver's seat can be activated as from terminal R ON. Two 
memory positions and the current seat position can be stored. By pressing the memory 
button "M" followed by pressing button "1" or "2", the current position of the driver's seat 
is assigned to the pressed button. At the same time, the current position of the outside 
mirrors is also assigned to the pressed button. The information for storing the outside 
mirror position is sent by the driver's seat module via the K-CAN. 

Note: The memory position of the outside mirrors 
is stored in the Footwell Module. 

Controls 


Backrest Width Adjustment Button 

The backrest width button switches to ground. The button 
returns to its initial position after every time it is pressed. It is 
integrated in the side panel of the seat. 

Lumbar Support Button, Seat Adjustment Switch, 
Memory Button 

The lumbar support button is connected directly to the pump 
and the adjustment valves. The seat adjustment buttons and 
memory buttons are connected directly to the driver's seat 
module with memory function.

Control Units 


Center Console Switch Cluster 

The switches for the seat heating are integrated in the center console switch cluster. 
They are designed as 3-stage switches. 

The first switch stage switches on the seat heating with maximum heating power. The 
medium heating setting is activated after pressing the button a second time. The seat 
heating with the lowest heating output setting is switched on in the third switch stage. 

The seat heating is switched off by pressing the button again or pressing it for longer 
than 1.2 s. 

The center console switch cluster is connected by means of a ribbon cable to the air 
conditioning control unit (IHKA). The control unit makes the connection to the K-CAN. 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The JBE features a control output each for the driver's and front passenger's seat heat¬ 
ing. The signal sent by the JBE is pulse width modulated. The signal frequency is 25 Hz. 

Note: The JBE undertakes the control of the driver's seat heating only when no 
driver's seat module with memory function is installed. 

Seat Heating Module 

The seat heating module evaluates the signal from the junction box control unit. The seat 
heating module is connected by means of three connectors. One connector establishes 
the connection to the vehicle. The other two connectors are responsible for connecting 
the seat heating. 

Driver's Seat Module with Memory Function 

The driver's seat module is installed when the seat is equipped with electrical adjustment 
and a memory function. The seat module therefore receives the information via the 
K-CAN for controlling the seat heating. The seat module also evaluates the memory 
buttons and the seat adjustment switches. 

The requests from the memory buttons for the outside mirrors are made available via 
the K-CAN. The seat memory setting is stored in the seat module. 

The requests from the seat adjustment switches are executed directly by the seat 
module.

Rear Sun Shade 


Functions 

Overview 

The electrically operated roller sun blind features the following possible functions: 

• Rear sun shade up and down • Sleep mode 

- End position recognition • Child lock 

- Relieving tension in rear sun shade • Undervoltage 

- Motor protection 

Rear Sun Shade Up and Down 
Switch-on Conditions 

The rear sun shade can be operated as of "Terminal R ON" and is coupled to the enable 
for the Power Windows. The Car Access System 2 issues the enable via the K-CAN. 

The rear sun shade can be operated only when the power window function is enabled. 
The enable is also dependent on the country specific version and the status of the door 
contact. 

Operation 

The rear sun shade can be raised and lowered with the button in the center console. 

The control button needs only to be pressed briefly. The rear sun shade will move in the 
opposite direction if the control button is pressed again. 

Signal Path 

The SZM evaluates the signal from the control button and forwards it to the IHKA. The 
IHKA transfers the signal to the K-CAN and sends it to the junction box control unit. In 
turn, the junction box control unit activates the motor for the rear sun shade. 

End Position Recognition 

The motor blocks and the movement of the rear sun shade stops in the end position. 
The junction box control unit recognizes the end position by the increasing current and 
switches off the motor. 

Relieving Tension in Rear Sun Shade 

The rear sun shade is briefly reversed for approx. 20 ms in order to relieve the tension as 
fast as possible after blocking. This function protects the drive unit and mechanism of 
the rear sun shade. 

Motor Protection 

To protect the motor, the maximum activation time of the motor is limited to approx. 10 s.

Anti-trapping Protection 

The rear sun shade has no electronic anti-trapping function. The mechanism and drive 
units are designed such as to rule out any danger for the occupants posed by excessively 
high forces. 

Child Safety Lock 

The child safety lock is enabled or disabled by means of a button located in the driver's 
door switch cluster. It is not possible to operate the electric rear sun shade when the child 
safety lock is enabled. 

Current operation of the rear sun shade is not interrupted when the child safety lock is 
enabled. 

Undervoltage 

Operation of the rear sun shade is disabled if the system voltage drops below 9.0 V. 
Operation of the rear sun shade is enabled again with a system voltage higher than 
9.5 V. 

Current operation of the rear sun shade is not interrupted by the undervoltage protection 
facility but rather the procedure is completed. 

Behavior after Reset 

After a reset it is assumed that the rear sun shade is in the up position. On receiving the 
first request, an attempt is made to move the rear sun shade downward. The direction is 
reversed once if a blocking state is detected directly after activation. 

Sleep Mode 

The current position of the rear sun shade is stored in the JBE as soon as the vehicle 
assumes sleep mode. 

System Components 

The following components are involved in operation of the rear sun shade: 

• Button for rear sun shade 

• Control units 

- Integrated automatic climate control 

- Junction Box Electronics Control Module 

• Rear window sun shade motor.
