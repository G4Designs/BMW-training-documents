New Engine Variant 


The model redesign of the E65/E66 Series is accompanied by a comprehensive revision 
of the N62 engine. The N73 (twelve cylinder) engine remains unchanged. 

The power output and torque of the engine has been significantly increased. 

For 2006 model year, a redesigned 4.8 literValvetronic engine replaces the 4.4 liter 
Valvetronic.This significant increase in displacement is the reason the vehicle is now 
badged 750i/Li instead of 745i/Li. 

The following Chart shows the difference in horsepower and torque between the two 
engines:

The major changes to the engine are: 

• Air intake duct 

• Differentiated intake system (DISA) 

• Crankshaft 

• Oil dipstick 

• Oil pump 

• Inlet and exhaust valves 

• Sparkplugs 

• DM E 9.2.2 


Air Intake Duct 


The N62B48TU engine has a larger, two-channel air intake duct used for air intake. The 
use of two air boxes is solely for keeping the hood line low (aesthetics).

Differentiated Intake System (DISA) 

The previous fully variable intake system (DISA) is no longer used in the N62B48TU 
engine. A two-stage intake system (DISA) is used instead.

Operation of Dual Stage DISA System 

In the intake system a sliding sleeve (3) is located at the intake manifold for each cylinder. 
The position of the sleeves determines whether the intake passage is long (1) or short (2). 



Index 

Explanation 

Index 

Explanation 

1 

Long intake passage 

3 

Direction of movement of sliding sleeves 

2 

Short intake passage 




At idle a long intake passage is set (torque setting). 


From 4700 rpm (N62B48TU) the sleeves are pushed back and a short intake passage is 
thereby set (power setting). When there is no flow, the sliding sleeves remain in their 
respective position. 

Varying the intake passages controls the pressure wave in the intake manifold in such a 
way as to produce a boost effect in the high rpm range. 

The sliding sleeves are driven by a servomotor assigned to each cylinder bank. The two 
servomotors together with the differential pressure sensor form a single component. 

The 12V servomotors are actuated by the DME via a PWM signal. While the sliding 
sleeves are open (powersetting), the servomotors are actuated with a 5 % PWM signal 
in order to hold the sleeves in their open position. The servomotors do not have position 
feedback. The sleeves can be inspected visually through the throttle valve opening. The 
sleeves are opened and closed once when the ignition is turned on.This prevents the 
sleeves from seizing during extended operation in the torque setting. 

The bores for the fuel injectors and the connections for crankcase and tank ventilation are 
located on the intake system (DISA). The intake system is made of glass-fiber reinforced 
plastic. 


10 

E65/66 Model Update 

















Crankshaft 

The N62B48TU engine has a steel crankshaft. To reduce power loss due to oil churning 
in the crankcase, the crankpin width has been reduced from 42 mm to 36 mm. 

Oil Pump 

The geometry of the oil pump is vehicle specific adapted. Oil churning losses in the 
crankcase are further reduced by the modified design of the oil deflector. 

Oil Dipstick 

The E65 Facelift model series is equipped with an electronic oil level display. The dipstick 
has a modified handle in black. 

Inlet and Exhaust Valves 

The stem diameter has been reduced from 6 mm to 5 mm to reduce moving masses. 

Spark Plugs 

The previous surface-gap spark plugs with 2 ground electrodes have been replaced by 
spark plugs with the spark position brought forward and a hook electrode. This enables 
better ignition of the fuel/air mixture. In the new spark plugs the center electrode is made 
of platinum (replacement interval: every 100,000 km). 

Digital Motor Electronics DME 

The N62TU engine is equipped with the Digital Motor Electronics (DME) ME9.2.2.The 
functions of the ME 9.2.2 are the same as forthe previous ME 9.2 of the N62 engine 
with the following changes: 

• New processor 

• Lambda oxygen sensor LSU 4.9 

• Hot-film air-mass meter HFM 6 

• Software for electronic oil level measurement. 


11 

E65/66 Model Update 



Lambda Oxygen Sensor 

An LSU 4.9 oxygen sensor is used as the control sensorforeach cylinder bank. The LSU 
4.9 oxygen sensor reaches operational readiness twice as fast (10 sec.) as the LSU4.2. 
This rapid starting capability is made possible by the use of a smaller ceramic element. 
The outer dimensions of the oxygen sensor remain unchanged. 

The previous opening for the supply of ambient air (reference air measurement) has been 
dispensed with. The new sensor differs from the LSU 4.2 in that a porous layer perme¬ 
able by air is used instead of a reference air channel. The function stays the same. The 
ambient air is directed to the measuring element via the connecting cable. 

Hot-film Air-mass Meter (HFM) 

The HFM 6.4 is used in the N62TU engine.The sensor signal is already digitized in the 
HFM 6.4.The digitized signal is sent to the DME. 


12 

E65/66 Model Update 



Transmission 


The GA6HP26Z automatic transmissions has been optimized for all the model series in 
the following respects: 

• New linings on the shift clutches 

• Use of new fine filters in the hydraulic system 

• Newly designed converter connection 

The new designation forthe transmission is GA6HP28Z. 

The newly designed transmission control unitGS 19.11 is used forthe automatic trans¬ 
missions. Compared to its predecessor (GS 19.04) it offers the following advantages: 

• New processor with higher computing capacity and flash memory expanded from 
512 KB to 1 MB 

• Designed to withstand higher temperatures 

• Electromagnetic compatibility considerably improved 

• Reserve for further functions 

• Optimization of shift quality, shifting time and hysteresis tuning. 

The control unit is located on the mechatronics module in the transmission. 

The housing and the pin assignments have not been changed.

Chassis and Suspension 


There continue to be three different suspension variants as before: Newly tuned stan¬ 
dard suspension (air suspension standard on the long versions), Sport suspension, 
Electronic Damper Control 

Further suspension modifications include: 

• Widening of the total toe on the rear axle by 14 mm 

• Redesigned cruise control (ACC II) 

• 750i has 17" high performance brake on the front axle

Exterior Design 

The current BMW 7 Series has been on the market since Autumn 2001. During this 
period the E65 - together with the E66 long version - has surpassed even the success¬ 
ful predecessor model E38 in terms of sales figures. The responsibility for this sales suc¬ 
cess lies predominantly with the US market. 

The body has been redesigned all round. The vehicle boasts a new: 

• Hood 

• Trunk lid 

• Front fenders 

• Front light assembly 

• Rear light assembly 

• Kidney grills 

• Accentuated side skirt 

• Front bumper cover 

• Rear Bumper cover 

• Wheel well covers 

• Fog Lights 



Changes to the E65/66 Body 


15 

E65/66 Model Update 





Front End 

At the front end the headlights, the front grill, the bumper trim, the hood and the front 
fenders have been changed. 

The light rings around the high-beam headlights are now completely enclosed. Bi-xenon 
active (AHL controlled) headlights are included as standard. 

The fog lights are bigger and are accommodated in separate openings. 

The air intake in the bumper trim is equipped with three grills. The openings are adapted 
for the brakes, new engine, and ACC II (option). 

The front grille is now wider (14 chrome plated vertical bars per kidney) and their outer 
contours run almost parallel to the headlight contours. 

The front fenders have been modified in the area of the headlights. Due to the new head¬ 
light shape and the new front grill, the hood has also been redesigned. The hood and 
fenders are still made of aluminium. 


The wheel arch trims, bumper trim carriers and bonnet insulation trim have also been 
redesigned.

Rear End 


Rear Lights 

The newly designed rear lights with fibre-optic (wave guide) technology tail lights give the 
car an exclusive night-time design with outstanding visibility. 

The outer contours of the rear lights in the side panels have stayed the same. The rear 
quarter panels have not been changed. 

BumperTrim 

The bumper trim has also been redesigned. The side rubbing strips are slightly shorter 
and no longer stretch to the wheel well opening. The exhaust tailpipes are covered by the 
bumpertrim. 

Trunk Lid 

The design features of the trunk lid have also been altered. 

The three-part light surround has been replaced by two larger-sized rear lights which 
merge almost seamlessly into the rear lights in the quarter panels. 

Other new features next to the BMW badge with chrome frame are the country-specific 
numberplate trim and the long chrome strip which visually connects the reversing lights 
to each other. In addition, the new number plate lights and the new trunk lid lock are inte¬ 
grated in the trunk lid. 

The trunk lid trim panel is adapted to the new trunk lid. The bulbs in the rear fog/reversing 
lights can be easily replaced by unclipping the corresponding trim panels. The trunk lid 
lock is located to the right of the numberplate light and is not longer directly visible.

E65/66 Model Update 


















All three rubbing strips and the impact absorber can be removed from the outside. 

The points at which the bumper trim is connected to the body have not changed (red 
arrows on picture below). 

Structural changes to the front and rear bumper trims have increased the length of the 
car by 10 mm. Thus the new length is 5039 mm forthe E65 and 5179 mm for the E66.

Interior Design 


The interior is now even more appealing and of higher-quality thanks to the use of new 
materials, colors and surfaces. 

For example, all the trims and the fresh-air grills which are in the immediate field of vision 
of the occupants are coated with superior quality paint (titanium instead of dark silver). 

The headliner trims are coated with structural soft paint in the corresponding headliner 
color (beige, black or stone-grey). 

The decorative trims now also come in new, superior-quality wood designs. "American 
walnut" replaces "black cherry" in the basic equipment specification. The fine wood 
design light or dark "variegated ash" is available as an option. 

Many individual parts such as e.g. locking knobs, inside door handles, frames of drinks 
holders etc. are modeled in pearl-effect chrome.

Controller 


The increase in quality can also be seen from the example of the controller. The controller 
has a new shape and is made from a new material. It is designed in a so-called mono¬ 
sandwich with leather insert. The leather insert has a practical as well as a visual benefit 
for the customer in that it is equally pleasant to touch when hot or cold. The controller 
trim has a new shiny finish thanks to the titanium paint.

Bi-Xenon Control Unit 

The bi-xenon control unit is mounted on the bi-xenon headlight. It provides the voltage 
supply and ignition voltage for the bi-xenon lamp. 

Bi-Xenon Headlights 

The E65/E66 has new headlights. The headlights have a new contour line and a com¬ 
pletely new internal design. Front direction indicators are only available in white and the 
only variant available for the US is bi-xenon with adaptive directional headlight control. 

The light for the parking light rings is generated by a common bulb and directed via the 
fibre optics to the parking light rings.

Headlight Washer System 


From March 2005 production, the headlight washer system will be included in the basic 
equipment specification in all E65/E66 models. The high pressure nozzle is no longer 
attached to the headlight but attached to the carrier of the bumpertrim.The nozzle is 
aligned in such a way that only the lens in the area of the low beam light is cleaned. The 
shape of the nozzle and its cover cap have been adapted to the new design.

Tail Lamp Assemblies 

The rear light cluster of the E65/E66 is split into two parts (formerly three parts). One part 
is integrated in the side panel of the body while the other part is integrated in the trunk lid. 

The outer contour and the mounting of the rear lights in the quarter panels have not 
changed but the internal design has been completely changed. 

The rear lights in the trunk lid are newly designed. Only white direction indicators and sil¬

Tail Lights 

The tail lights of the E65/E66 have fibre-optic waveguides similar to the E39 sport wagon. 

Each of the two tail lights (right or left side of the car) comprises two fibre-optic modules 
that are each made up of four fibre-optic waveguides. The fourfibre-optic waveguides are 
arranged one on top of the other and each supplied with light by an LED. Because the 
four LEDs are connected in series, the entire rear light section must be replaced if one 
LED fails. 

The advantage of fibre-optic technology lies in the fact that LEDs have a significantly 
longer service life and a lower energy requirement than conventional bulbs. The illumina¬ 
tion of the tail light is considerably more uniform than that of a bulb, which is bright in the 
middle and grows much darker towards the edges. Another reason for using this technol¬ 
ogy is that the design simply looks better.

Brake Light 

The left and right brake lights are each generated by 16 LEDs. Unlike the parking light 
LEDs, the brake LEDs are connected in parallel, i.e. if one LED fails the other LEDs 
remain operational. The LED module can be replaced. When the brake light is actuated, 
tail light 1 is also switched on - even if the light was not switched on. The high-mounted 
brake light remains unchanged.

E65/66 Model Update 








Brake Force Display 

The rearfog lights are also used forthe brake force displays (two-stage brake lights). 
The car speed must be >5 km/h forthe brake force displays to be activated. 

And at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied: 

• Braking deceleration >5 m/s2 and/or 

• Control intervention by the anti-lock braking system. 

The information on car speed, braking deceleration and control intervention by the anti¬ 
lock braking system is received by the light module in the form of CAN messages from 
the DSC. The light module activates the brake force display when the above mentioned 
conditions are satisfied. 

The brake force display remains activated until the driver lets off the brake pedal. 



Rear Side Marker Light 

The reartail lamp is equipped with two extra LEDs which shine through 
openings in the side trim directly as a side-marker lamp. 

These LEDs cannot be replaced.

Bus Overview 


C hanges in the E65/E66 Bus Diagram in 03/2005 

Adaptive Directional Headlights and Light Module 

When adaptive directional headlights were introduced, it was necessary to connect the 
AHL control unit to the PT-CAN. 

The AHL control unitwill be removed from the vehicle in 03/2005 because this function is 
to be taken over by the LM light module. The light module receives the information from 
the PT-CAN (yaw rate, road speed and steering angle) via a direct PT-CAN connection. 

MOST 

The KHI headphones interface KHI and LOGIC7 control units have changed places in 
the MOST ring. 

PT-CAN 

Active Cruise Control II ACC II is used instead of Active Cruise Control ACC. 

Changes in the E65/E66 Bus Diagram Since 03/2004 

There have already been some changes in the bus structure due to the ISIS in 03/2004 

K-CAN S 

The RDC control unit was removed because the tire monitoring function was taken over 
by the Run Flat Indicator software in the DSC. 

Dropping of the KHA module (headphones connection) as a control unit on the K-CAN. 
The jacks of the headphone connections for rear-compartment entertainment are con¬ 
nected directly to the KHI (headphones interface). 

MOST

byteflight 

The satellites are connected directly to the SGM (Safety and Gateway Module) through 
integration ofthe SIM in the gateway module. The star structure ofthe byteflight has 
been retained. The SGM serves as the main gateway for the entire bus system. 

PT-CAN 

The PT-CAN has been extended to include the a second DM E control unit. This was 
deemed necessary when the 12-cylinder engine was introduced in the 760i/il_.

E65/E66MU Energy Management 


The CAS and DME control units are no longer powered by separate outputs on the 
power module. These control units are combined together with the light module, the 
instrument cluster and the FBD (remote control receiver) on a common connection. 

This output is known as Terminal 30 Special loads/consumers (Kl. 30SV).This terminal 
can be switched by means of a hardware alteration in the power module.

E65/66 Model Update 







































































































New Deactivation Strategy 

In the previous concept of power module deactivation, only the path of terminal 30 
loads/consumers (term. 30B and term. 30U) was de-energized in the event of a closed 
circuit current fault. Only the current at term. 30U and term. 30B was evaluated to detect 
this fault. 

What is new is that terminal 30SV can now also be switched. However current measure¬ 
ment is not possible at terminal 30SV. Increased closed-circuit current consumption is 
detected indirectly by monitoring bus communication on the K-CAN. 

If bus communication is present without reason, terminal 30SV is briefly disconnected 
from the power supply. 

In this way it is possible to rectify possible problems caused by faulty software because 
the control units should switch back into sleep mode properly after the restart. The infor¬ 
mation on a problem however is stored in the power module and the workshop can 
search for a fault in the affected control units at terminal 30SV. 

Disconnection of term. 30SV is performed only if term. 30B and term. 30U were already 
disconnected beforehand or at the same time and if none of the light functions (parking 
lights, hazard warning system) is switched on. 

Deactivation strategy in event of excessive closed-circuitcurrent 

1. Reset of terminal 30U and terminal 30B in event of violation of the closed-circuit 
current threshold (as previously) 

2. Disconnection of terminal 30U and terminal 30B in event of renewed violation of 
the closed-circuit current threshold (as previously) 

3. Reset of terminal 30SVforl0 seconds (new) if the bus users on the K-CAN (PM, 
CAS, LM, instrument cluster, DWA) have not gone to sleep within 5 minutes of 
terminals 30U and 30B being disconnected. 

The "Term. 30SV reset" procedure is carried out only once within a closed-circuit 
current monitoring phase as this action causes the entire vehicle electrical system 
to be cut in (high current consumption). 

Deactivation strategy in event of too many wake-up operations 

1. Disconnection of terminal 30U and terminal 30B if the wake-up counterthreshold is 
reached, currently 30 wake-up operations 

2. Reset of terminal 30SVforl0 seconds (new) if the bus users on the K-CAN (PM, 
CAS, LM, instrument cluster, DWA) have not gone to sleep within 5 minutes of ter¬ 
minals 30U and 30B being disconnected. 

Note: The connected control units are not operational during the period when 
terminal 30SV is deactivated. The car cannot be unlocked with the 
remote control during this phase.

E65/66 Model Update 



It is still possible to open the car door with the mechanical key, but this results in an alarm 
being triggered if a movement in the passenger compartment is detected as the anti¬ 
theft alarm system is still armed and responds as if for example a window has been bro¬ 
ken. The anti-theft alarm system is deactivated by inserting the ID sensor in the CAS slot, 
whereby disarming is signalled to the anti-theft alarm system if the vehicle electrical sys¬ 
tem is activated. 

Note: The instrumentclusterretainsthedataon account ofthe brief discon¬ 
nection (10 seconds). Only the clock is slow by the corresponding time. 

Normal Sleep Procedure 

In a "normal" car sleep procedure, the CAN bus goes to sleep a few minutes after "termi¬ 
nal R OFF". After 16 minutes the PM sends the signal to deactivate the loads/consumers 
and the bus is woken up briefly in the process. The "VA_Roof" driver is deactivated and 
the CAN bus goes to sleep again. After 60 minutes have elapsed (codable value if no 
telephone/EGS logs in as a load/consumer in stationary mode 16 minutes) the 
"VA_Body" driver is also deactivated, by means of which a current of approx. 200 mA for 
relay activation forVA_K is likewise omitted. The power module then goes into closed-cir¬ 
cuit current monitoring mode. 

Detection of a C losed-Circuit Current Violation 

During closed-circuit current monitoring the power module measures the voltage value 
every 5 seconds and the current value every 60 seconds. 

The power module goes into increased closed-circuit monitoring mode in the event of a 
closed-circuit current violation (I >80 mA). Here the power module determines the pre¬ 
sent current value every 1.5 seconds over a waiting period of 8 minutes. During this peri¬ 
od the vehicle electrical system is given the opportunity to accept a normal closed-circuit 
current again. 

If during the 8 minutes a current is detected which is below the closed-circuit current 
threshold of 80 mA for longer than one minute, the waiting period is started again and the 
power module goes into closed-circuit current monitoring mode again. 

If the closed-circuit current violation persists afterthe waiting period has elapsed, the 
shutdown counter is started (90 seconds). 

Then a general reset is performed. General reset means that all loads/consumers sup¬ 
plied by the power module with the exception of terminal 30SV and the anti-theft alarm 
system are disconnected from the battery for 30 seconds. Then the closed-circuit current 
is monitored for a further 8 minutes. 

If the closed-circuit current violation persists, the shutdown counter is started again (90 
seconds). Then all the loads/consumers are deactivated (with the exception of terminal 
30SV and the anti-theft alarm system). 

If a further closed-circuit current violation is indirectly determined via bus activity over a 
time period of 5 minutes, a one-off reset of terminal 30SV is performed for 10 seconds.

Measures for Maintaining Battery Starting Capability (SoC) 

Electric Loads/Consumers in Stationary Mode 

Certain loads/consumers may be active even when closed-circuit current monitoring of 
the power module is already running. This is necessary for various reasons: 

• Legally required electric loads, e.g. parking lights, hazard warning system 

• Convenience for the customer, e.g. radio function, telephone 

These loads/consumers must be excluded from the closed-circuit monitoring system in 
orderto avoid misinterpretation in the power module. Forthis purpose, these loads/con¬ 
sumers must log in with the power module. In turn, the power module recognizes the 
activity and accepts the higher power consumption. When these systems are deactivat¬ 
ed, the corresponding control units log off from the power module. 

Disconnection of Terminal 30 

In the previous concept of power module deactivation, terminal 30 (term. 30U and term. 
30B) was not disconnected in the case of a car without a closed-circuit current violation. 

A slow drop in the capacity of the car battery (SoC = state of charge) below the starting 
capability limit without a discernible reason was possible and this effect was counteracted 
by no action of the power module. 

The following function is new: 

When loads/consumers are logged off, a codable waiting time (currently 5 minutes) 
ensues from the point "terminal R OFF". 

Term. 30U and term. 30B are disconnected from the battery when the state of charge 
drops below the starting capability limit. 

This disconnection is not preceded by a "general reset".

Shortening of Run-OnTime 

Before Facelift (3/2005) - The power module deactivation in a car with a closed-circuit 
current fault, a further battery disconnection on account of a closed-circuit current viola¬ 
tion takes place only after a run-on time of 60 minutes (16 minutes). 

As a result of this long run-on time the state of battery charge could drop far below the 
value of the starting capability limit without an intervention by the power module. 


SoC 



As of 3/2005 - The improvement of the new deactivation strategy becomes apparent 
with a renewed activation of the loads/consumers (by a terminal change or unlocking of 
the car) in the event of a previously ascertained closed circuit current violation or an 
extended starting capability limit which has already been reached. 

In this case, closed-circuit current monitoring already begins after 2 minutes (normally 60 
minutes). Together with the fixed waiting period of 8 minutes, it would therefore take a 
maximum of 10 minutes until the shutdown counter is started. 

The shortened run-on time is reset again as soon as the power module has registered an 
"engine running" status once.

CD Changer 

The CD changer available for the E65/66 facelift (Option 672) now supports the playback 
of CDs with MP3 and WMA files.The MP3/WMA files are decoded in the CD changer. 

What is MP3? 

• Stands for M PEG Layer 3 (MPEG = Moving Pictures Expert Group) 

• Is a music compression method. It is based on the formats originally designed for 
digital sound or picture transmission (MPEG 1 or 2) 

• It requires 8 to 12 times less storage space for virtual CD quality. Approximately 
10 audio CDs in compressed form can be stored on a standard 640 MB data CD. 

• It was developed by the German Fraunhofer Institute for integrated circuits 
(Fraunhofer IIS Audio). 

What is WMA? 

• Like M P3, Windows Media Audio (WMA) is a compression method for audio 

data that produces a sound with more detail than M P3 at low bit rates (up to approxi¬ 
mately!^ kbit/s). 

Operation, Display, and Playback 

The CD changer is operated by means of the controller. 

Information such as folder name, music track, or artist are shown in the central display. 
Detailed information based on ID3 tags can also be represented. ID3 tags contain 
additional information that is added to the music data. 

If a basic audio system is installed, the decoded data of the CD is sent as digital signals 
via the MOST to the ASK. Here they are converted to analogue data and output via the 
amplifier and the speakers. 

If a 'Top-HiFi' system (Logic7) is installed, the decoded audio data are transmitted in digi¬ 
tal form via the MOST from the CD changer directly to the Top-H iF i amplifier, from where 
it is output. 

The CDs are played back even when the CD changer is simultaneously holding CDs with 
M P3 files, WMA files, and "normal" audio data.
