CarCommunication Computer 

In principle, the structure of the carcommunication computer corresponds to that of a 
personal computer. In the same way as a personal computer, the car communication 
computer contains a processor as well as RAM modules and other peripheral compo¬ 
nents. Certain functions such as the voice input control system are integrated in the form 
of software in the carcommunication computer. 

The carcommunication computer is the central control module for all applications. It is 
always coupled with the 8.8" split-screen central information display.The carcommuni¬ 
cation computer also features the high variant of the controller with haptic feedback. 

The carcommunication computer is based on a modular design, i.e. the main systems of 
the communication network are integrated in the form of modules in the carcommunica¬ 
tion computer. It can be configured and expanded corresponding to requirements. At the 
time of market launch, the following modules/functions will be integrated in the carcom¬ 
munication computer: 

• Radio double tuner 

• DVD navigation system, Professional (map presentation) 

• Voice control system 

• ASK functions 

• MOST-CAN gateway functions 



The following advantages are achieved by combining several control units in one module: 

• Increased functionality by combining several systems 

• Easy to expand/upgrade by means of software with corresponding interfaces 

• Fewer plug connections therefore fewer potential fault sources 

• Reduced package space for control units

Components 


The car communication computer consists of several components: 


Housing 

CD-ROM drive 

DVD drive 

HIP-module 
(host independence 
positioning module) 



The car communication computer is accommodated in an 
aluminium casing. The size of the car communication 
computer corresponds to two radio DIN casings. 



The following types of CD can be played on the CD-ROM 
drive: 

- Audio CD 

- Audio CD-ROM with M P3 files 


Gyro sensor 
Tuner module 
Main board

When the navigation system is not in use, the DVD drive 
can also be used to play audio CDs oraudio CD-ROMs 
with MP3 files. 


Power board

The HIP module contains the GPS receiverthat has the 
task of converting and decoding the signals received from 
the GPS aerial.:

The gyro sensor is a separate module that is connect¬ 
ed via plug contacts to the main board and is secured 
by a screw. 



In addition to the CPU (Central Processing Unit)fur¬ 
ther processors and main memories are mounted 
on the main board.The main board also contains 
plug-in slots for expansion boards. 


PMC-card 2 open 

PCMCIA-card for memory

The power board is located at the rear of the car 
communication computer.The FAKRA main con¬ 
nector for the power supply and the MOST connec¬ 
tor are secured on the power board. The main con¬ 
nector provides the interface to the vehicle electrical 
system. 





The ASK functions are located on the audio board. 
Two digital sound processors facilitate simultaneous 
conditioning of the audio signals and operation of 
the voice control system.

Service Conceptforthe CarCommunication Computer 

The service concept is such that individual modules and parts of the carcommunication 
computer can be replaced in the event of malfunction, thus serving to reduce repair 
costs. A differentiation is made between electronic and mechanical parts. 

Electronic Parts 

Replacement of the following electronic parts is planned: 

CD drive DVD drive Tunermodule HIP module 

Gyro Frontpanel Audio board Memorymodule 

PMC cards Electric fan 

Mechanical Parts 

Following mechanical parts are available: 

Top cover Bottom cover 

CD retaining fixture DVD drive holder 

Cover PMC slot Cover PCMCIA slot 


DVD drive retaining fixture 

CD drive holder 

Rubber mount for electric fan 


Particular attention must be paid to electrostatic discharge ESD when working on the car 
communication computer. Disregard of the safety requirements may result in damage to 
the electronic components in the carcommunication computer. 

Working on Electronic Components 
Preparatory Work 

The following points must be observed when working on electronic components of the 
carcommunication computer corresponding to the service concept: 

• All work must be carried out on a conductive and earthed workbench. 

• The special tool 12 7 192 is additionally used forthis purpose. 

• The earthing cable must be connected to a secure and reliable earthing point (water 
pipe, heating pipe, socket outlet earth). Before taking the parts out of their packag¬ 
ing, the person working on the components must first put on the wrist cuff in order 
to discharge himself.The electronic components are placed on the antistatic mat 
and also connected with the earthing cable.

Replacement 

The electronic components must be replaced as described in the repair instructions and 
following the procedure described on SIP Electrostatic Fundamentals, while observing 
ESD safety measures.

Note: The Antistatic Mat at your Center may look different than the one shown 
here oratthe training center. Rememberthe following when using the 
Antistatic Mat: 


• Ground the Antistatic Matto the workbench using the attached lead 


• Attach the Grounding strap to the component being serviced 


• Always wearthe wrist cuff.

System Functions 

The car communication computer comprises the following functions: 

• Radio 

• DVD navigation, Professional (map presentation) 

• Voice control system 

• Online platform 

• Audio management 

• ASK functions 

• Driverfor central information display 

• MOST CAN gateway 

Voice Control System 

A voice control system High is integrated in the car communication computer. With this 
system, all functions shown in the CID can be controlled by voice commands. This sys¬ 
tem has the advantage that the hands need not be taken off the steering wheel while dri¬ 
ving in order to change settings. 

The SES can be used to control the following systems: 

• Entertainment 

• Communication 

• Navigation 

• Climate 

• "5th Menu" setting 

The voice control system makes use of specific voice commands. The voice control sys¬ 
tem sets up a dialogue with the user. Repeat requests are issued if the system did not 
understand a command. 

System Integration 

The voice control system is loaded as pure software in the car communication computer. 
The voice control system makes use of the memories and processors in the car commu¬ 
nication computers as well as the hardware of other systems (e.g. microphones). 

The two hands-free microphones in the front roof console are used in connection with 
the voice control system. The hands-free microphones are connected directly to the 
telematics control unit (TCU).TheTCU sends the microphone signals via MOST to the 
car communication computer where they are processed in the DSP in order to execute 
the required functions.

Functional Principle of Voice Control System 
System Start/End 

The voice control system is activated/deactivated via the push-to-talk button (PTT) on 
the multifunction steering wheel or on the controller. Forthe first time, the PTT button on 
the controller makes it possible forthe passengerto use the voice control system (SES). 
The SES is activated forthe driver by briefly pressing the button and forthe passenger by 
pressing and holding the button longer. 

The SES is deactivated by again pressing one of the PTT buttons. Activation of the SES 
is indicated by a graphic display (PTT logo) in the status line of the CID.The system is 
active for about 5 seconds. If no input takes place during this period of time, the user is 
informed that no voice input was detected and the request for voice input is repeated. 

The voice control system is deactivated if again no input is made within 5 seconds.
