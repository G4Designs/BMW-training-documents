Introduction to Comfort Access 


Comfort Access (SA 322) is offered as an option forthe 750i/iL & 760i/iL. 

"Comfort access" is a passive access system. This means the vehicle can be unlocked 
by grasping the outer door handle, provided the identification transmitter is located within 
a radius of no more than approx. .5 - 1.5 m from the vehicle. 

With Comfort Access it is sufficient forthe driverto simply carry the identification trans¬ 
mitter on his/her person in orderto unlock, lock or start the vehicle. 

With this system the operation/functions are distributed among several control modules. 
Comfort Access system utilizes the same modules that are utilized forthe Central 
Locking function plus a Comfort Access module specifically for monitoring the systems 
antennas, activation of the remote receiver and monitor status of the Electronic Outer 
DoorHandle.

System Overview 


With regard to the Comfort Access System the remote control is referred to as an 
Identification Transmitter since the remote is transmitting ID data to the vehicle without 
any action being performed by the user (buttons on the remote do not need to be 
pressed). 

Passive Entry 

Passive Entry enables access to the vehicle without operating the ID Transmitter/remote 
control. 

Unlocking 

As the customer approaches the vehicle with the ID Transmitter located on his/her per¬ 
son and places their hand between the door handle and the door panel or depresses the 
button on the trunk lid, the system "wakes up" and a signal is transmitted via K-TAGE 
Bus to CAS. CAS in turn requests a verification that a valid ID transmitter is located with¬ 
in the radius of the transmitting antenna, via K-TAGE Bus to the door modules or antenna 
located on the rear bumper. 

The request is made by transmitting a signal from the respective doorhandle module or 
antennas located in the rear bumperto the ID Transmitter, which returns an ID signal that 
is received by the antenna located on the rear window. 

The signal received by the antenna on the rearwindow is transmitted to the CAS and 
the ID information is verified. If the ID is valid the door can be unlocked by pulling up on 
the door handle ortrunk will be unlocked by depressing the button. 

Passive Go 

The passive go function makes it possible to start the vehicle without the ID transmitter 
being inserted in its holder. 

Note: The vehicle cannot be started without a valid ID transmitter being locat¬ 
ed in the interior of the vehicle. 

Starting 

Upon entering the vehicle the engine can be started by pressing the start button with the 
brake pedal depressed, as long as the valid ID transmitter is located in the interior of the 
vehicle. 

The presence of a valid ID transmitter is determined by the interior antennas and validat¬ 
ed by the CAS which will release the start enable signal.

E65/66 Comfort Access 




Passive Exit 


The passive exit function makes it possible to lock the vehicle without actively using the 
ID transmitter/remote control. 

Note:The vehicle cannot be unlocked withouta valid identification transmitter 
within a radius of .5 - 1.5 m from the respective antenna. 

Locking 

On exiting the vehicle the doors can be locked by pressing on the doorhandle, as long as 
all doors are closed and a valid ID transmitter is determined to be located outside of the 
vehicle. In the event that the system detects a valid ID transmitter inside the vehicle 
and/orthe system does not detect the presence of a valid ID transmitter on the outside of 
the vehicle, the doors will unlock and display a message on the check control display. 

Special Comfort Access Functions 

The Comfort Access System offers additional special functions that are determined by 
the actions of the user such as: 

ID Transmitter Remains in Vehicle 

If another ID transmitter is detected on the inside of the vehicle and a valid ID transmitter 
is detected/determined to be located on the outside, then the transmitter located on the 
inside is ignored/deactivated and the vehicle is secured. Once the vehicle is unlocked 
again the key that was deactivated is reactivated. 

ID Transmitter Remains in Trunk 

When the trunk lid is closed/locked a status signal is received by the power module which 
transmits the information to the Comfort Access module . The Comfort Access module 
starts a search for an ID transmitter in the trunk, if a valid transmitter is located by the 
antenna in the trunk a signal is sent to the CAS, which in turn transmits a request to the 
power module to open the trunk. 

In order to lock the trunk with a spare key located inside: 

• It must be determined that a valid ID transmitter is located on the outside of the vehi¬ 
cle within the radius of the antenna. 

• Valet switch must be active 

Engine Start Disable 

The engine cannot be started if the identification transmitter is located in the luggage 
compartment of the unlocked vehicle. 


6 

E65/66 Comfort Access 



Starting Engine without ID Transmitter 

The function makes it possible to start the vehicle within 10 s after"engine OFF" without 
detecting the identification transmitter. This function is intended for cases where the 
identification transmitter is not detected due to high frequency interference, as an exam¬ 
ple. 

Check Control Message, Terminal 15 

The Comfort Access System enables terminal selection without the ID transmitter being 
inserted in its holder. It is possible that terminal 15 is selected by pressing the START- 
STOP button. A corresponding check control message is shown in the instrument clus¬ 
ter afterthe door is opened. An audible signal also sounds. 

Note: The battery may be discharged if the driver ignores the warnings 
and locks the vehicle. 

Unintentional Wake-up Function 

In orderto avoid waking the electronic outer door handle module by touching the outer 
doorhandle without a valid identification transmitter. The outer door handle module is 
requested by CAS to send a signal to the ID Transmitter requesting the transmission of a 
valid/authentication signal. 

If no valid ID transmitter is detected, the electronic outer door handle module receives 
this information from the CAS and in this case, the electronic outer door handle module 
remains inactive until a valid identification transmitter is detected. 

Locking with Engine Running 

The vehicle can also be unlocked with the engine running if the engine was started with 
passive go. When leaving the vehicle, the ID transmitter must also be taken and the vehi¬ 
cle locked from the outside.

Each Door Handle M odule can be woken-up by pulling or pushing on the handle, when 
this occurs the status of the handle is transmitted to the door module and then onto the 
CAS and CA module via the K-CAN Periphery. The door handle also transmits a signal to 
the ID transmitter requesting it to transmit a validation signal, which is acquired by the 
remote Receiver antenna in the rear window and forwarded to the CAS for authentication. 
If the signal is recognized an enable signal is sentfrom the CAS to the respective door 
handle and the door can be unlocked. 

Each door handle module is connected by a 4-wire connection to a respective door 
module. 

Electronic Unlock Motor 

Each lock in the vehicles doors incorporates an electric unlock motor. The motor assists 
in unlocking the locking pawl of the door in a timely manner after authentication of the ID 
transmitter and the handle being pulled.

ID T ransmitter/Remote C ontrol 

The ID transmitter contains the following functions: 

• Incorporates the normal remote control buttons 

• Able to receive signal from transmitting vehicle antennas 

• Signal encryption 

• Transmission of encrypted high frequency information 

• Mechanical Keys 

Since the key does not need to be inserted into the holderto start the vehicle the battery 
of the remote control/ID Transmitter is no longer chargeable, therefore requiring the bat¬ 
tery to be replaced. Under "average" usage the the battery may need to be replaced 
once a year.

Service Information 


CarWash 

If the vehicle is to be taken through a CarWash the ID transmitter must be inserted into 
the 'Key" holder slot of the ignition switch while the engine is running in orderto keep 
the parking gearfrom engaging automatically. 

By inserting the ID transmitter with the engine running and gear engaged the Comfort 
Access functions are deactivated. If the engine is the switched off via the start/stop but¬ 
ton the "N" position is automatically engaged. 

CBS Data 

Atthis time the transmission of Condition Based Service (CBS) data to the identification 
transmitter via the radio interface forthe E65 is not possible. 

In orderto update the CBS data residing in the ID Transmitter, if the Passive Go function 
is being used (ID Transmitter is not being inserted into the "Key" holder slot on the igni¬ 
tion switch): 

• Insert the ID Transmitter into the slot of the ignition switch 

• Hold the central-lock rocker switch forapprox.10 seconds in the "Unlock" position 

• An audible gong will indicate that the key data has been updated 

Door-Selective Unlocking 

Door unlocking is performed selectively if "selective unlocking" is coded in the key- 
memory function (otherwise "global unlocking"). 

To unlock the remaining doors with door-selective unlocking, press the center-lock rock- 
erswitch into the "Unlock" position. 

Missing ID Transmitter 

If the engine is started and the ID transmitter is removed from the passenger compart¬ 
ment of the vehicle as a result of a person leaving the vehicle while in possession of the 
ID Transmitter (driver change, someone is being dropped-off etc.): 

• The engine is not automatically switched-off, as this is not permitted by law 

• A Check Control message appears if a dooris opened and then closed again 

• Once the engine has been switched off, it can be restarted within 10 seconds even 
if there is no identification transmitter inside the car (i.e. without valid drive autho¬ 
rization). This is important in the event the engine stumbles/stops on a railroad 
crossing and there is no identification transmitter inside the car. 

For safety reasons the owner should carry the wallet key. The wallet key in conjunction 
with the adapter permits drive authorization; this enables the carto be driven even when 
the identification transmitter is missing.

Component Replacement 

Despite being of the same design, the front and rear outside doorhandles on the pas¬ 
senger side are not interchangeable. Each Electronic Outer Door Handle must be 
installed in the correct installation location (note part numbers) so that the motorfor 
unlocking the locking pawl (electric opening motor) operates properly. 

In addition, each Electronic Outer Door-Handle has a logical bus address. 

Diagnosis 

Comfort Access Fault Memory 

The following possible faults are stored in the fault memory of the Comfort Access 
Module: 

• Overvoltage or undervoltage, terminal 30 (functional limits, Comfort Access) 

• Short circuit to positive or open circuit or contact break in relays for all 5 interior 
antennas, trunk antenna and both bumper mounted antennas 

• Faulty relay coil at all relays, sticking relay contact at all relays with antenna outputs 

• Faulty output stage 

• Excess temperature at output stage 

• Faulty K-bus interface 

• Sticking Hall sensor (TAGE) 

• Faulty capacitive sensor (TAGE) 

Fault Memory, Electronic Outer Door-Handle 

Faults detected by the Electronic Outer Door-Handle are stored in a non-volatile memory 
which is able to store a maximum of 16 faults. 

The faults are stored in the order in which they occurred. 

Flash programming forthe Electronic Outer Door-Handle is not planned. 

Initialization 

Forthe Comfort Access System, the following components must be initialized after being 
replaced: 

• Comfort Access Module 

• Electronic Outer Door Handles 

The initialization is triggered by switching ignition to Term R, which results in the CAS 
transmitting the initialization automatically to the Comfort Access Module. The Comfort 
Access Module then transmits a signal to the Electronic Outer Door Handles. 

Initialization can also be performed via a test module for Comfort Access Initialization.
