Introduction 


Head-up Display (HUD) 

The very name "Head-up" describes the principle benefit of this system. The Head-up 
display (HUD) projects important information such as cruise control data or instructions 
from the navigation arrow are reflected onto the windshield glass and are thus perma¬ 
nently in the driver‘s field of vision. The driver of a BMW can have important data and 
graphics displayed directly in front of him, just like a pilot of a jet fighter. 

The Head-up display contains various functions aimed at enhancing road safety and 
driving comfort. This include displays: 

• Cruise control DCC Data 

• Navigation system information 

• Check Control messages 

• Vehicle speed. 

Having the displays in the driver's direct field of view increases safety, as the eyes 
are always on the traffic.

Functions 


The HUD can be compared to a projection device. A light source is required to project 
the HUD information. The LED array acts as this light source. The image content is 
created by the TFT projection display. The TFT projection display can be compared 
to a filter which admits or blocks light. 

An optical imaging element determines the shape, distance and size of the HUD 
images. The image appears to float freely over the road, the windshield acts as a 
deflecting mirror.

Switch-on Conditions 


The following conditions are required to release the light: 

• Terminal 15 ON 

• Switch (HUD) in the light switch cluster pressed. 


9 

E70 Head-up Display 











Switch-on Performance 


The HUD receives the terminal 30 ON status via the K-CAN. The HUD is partially ready 
for operation from terminal R ON. This means that: 

• The HUD can communicate with the other electrical-system users via the K-CAN 
and MOST 

• The TFT projection display is initialized and blanked 

• The LEDs are off. 


The HUD receives the terminal 15 ON status via the K-CAN. The HUD is ready for opera¬ 
tion from terminal 15 ON. This permits the following actions: 

• Activation of the back lighting via the button in the light switch cluster 

• HUD height adjustment 

• Adjustment of HUD brightness 

• Display of information via the HUD. 

When the vehicle is started, the vehicle is set to terminal 50 status. In terminal 50, i.e. 
Lights Off, the HUD goes into a hold status. This hold status is maintained until shortly 
after the end of the terminal 50 status. 

Switch-off Conditions 

The HUD is switched off under the 
following conditions: 

• Button in the light switch clutter 

• Terminal R OFF 

• Terminal 30g OFF. 

Brightness Offset 



Brightness offset is a Personal Profile function PIA. Brightness offset allows the customer 
to apply his own individual HUD base brightness setting and to store it. Each time the 
HUD is switched on, this setting is used as 


the brightness offset for the HUD. 

The brightness setting is adjusted with the 
controller via the CID. Any value between - 
10 and +10 can be set. The mid-position 
value is O.The value is transferred via the 
K-CAN to the HUD.

E70 Head-up Display 


Max 





The brightness setting is automatically corrected in order to compensate for different 
light conditions. Compensation is based on signals from the rain and light sensor. The 
automatic brightness setting is configured in such a way that no HUD brightness jumps 
occur. 

The differing light conditions depend, for instance, on: 

• Environmental conditions, such as day, night, sunshine, clouds, rain, fog, snow etc. 

• Structural conditions, such as tunnel, underground car park etc. 

• The driver can adjust the brightness of the instrument lighting with the knurled 
wheel. 

• From terminal 58g lights on, the HUD brightness is determined by the brightness 
setting of the instrument lighting. 

The brightness is dependent on the following conditions: 

• Dimmer-wheel setting 

• Brightness offset 

• RLS. 

The precise setting of the brightness is described in this Product Information in the 
"Service advice" section. 

Operating-hours Counter 

The HUD incorporates operating-hours counters for both the HUD and the LED array. 
When the HUD is replaced, the operating hours counter must be initialized at 0. 

Priority Management 

The HUD receives a whole range of information which is to be displayed. Since some 
information is more important than other information, the HUD is subject to priority man¬ 
agement. These priorities are: 

1. Diagnosis 

2. Check control messages 

3. Test functions 

4. Navigation. 


11 

E70 Head-up Display 



Display Area 

The HUD size is approximately 0 480 

200 mm x 100 mm with a display 0 
resolution of 480 x 240 pixels. The 
HUD is separated into 2 display 
areas. The individual fields are "opti¬ 
cally" separated in the image so that 
they can be identified more easily. 

The upper area shows navigation 
information and CC messages in 
the form of symbol, bar display and 240 
text. 

The lower area shows speed-related 
displays in the form of unit, current 
speed and cruise control.

Color Selection 

Symbols (such as warning symbols) are specified by the individual control units. This 
color specification is adopted for the display in the HUD. 2D symbols are used for opti¬ 
mum visibility and readability. 

The colors are: 

• Orange as the standard color 

• Red or yellow for warning messages 

• Green for the set speed 

• The HUD background is transparent.

System Components 


The separate components of the head-up display are the cover glass, mirrors, LED 
power supply, LED array, TFT projection display, PCB and casing. The head-up display 
can only be replaced as a complete unit. It is not possible to replace components or 
separate parts.

E70 Head-up Display 












The head-up display comprises the following components: 

• Cover glass 

• Mirrors 

• LED power supply 

• LED array 

• TFT projection display 

• PCB 

• Housing. 

The following components are reguired in addition to the components listed above: 

• Windshield 

• Light module 

• Rain/light sensor 

• Roof function center and junction box 

• HUD trim. 

The following elements are needed to operate the HUD: 

• On/Off button in the light switch cluster 

• Light switch in the light switch cluster 

• Instrument-lighting dimmer and 

• controller. 


Cover Glass 


The cover glass is made from scratch 
resistant, coated polycarbonate (PC) and 
closes off the top of the HUD. The cover 
glass protects the interior of the HUD 
against dust and objects accidentally 
placed on it. 

The glass and the HUD trim are curved so 
that any incident light is not reflected back 
to the driver. 

Furthermore, projection of the information 
in the display onto the windshield is guar¬ 
anteed without hindrance from stray light 
effects, for instance. 



14 

E70 Head-up Display 


Mirrors 


Two mirrors are fitted in the head-up dis¬ 
play. They reflect the information in the 
display onto the windshield. 

The convex mirror (1) responsible for 
compensating the image on the wind¬ 
shield and for the size and distance of the 
image. 

The flat mirror (2) is a deflecting mirror to 
keep the beam in the space provided. The 
convex mirror is made of plastic while the 
flat mirror is made of glass. 


LED Power Supply 



Index 

Explanation

Curved mirror 

2 

Plane mirror 


The power supply is a switched-mode 
power supply. It supplies the LED array with 
a voltage of 30 V which is transformed from 
the vehicle's electrical system voltage. 


LED Array 

The LED array is an arrangement of LEDs in 
one plane and acts as the back lighting for 
the TFT projection display. The LED array 
generates the light reguired for the HUD 
brightness 

White LEDs are fitted in the LED array. 
Depending on activation by the PCB, the 
LEDs generate the brightness of the HUD 
content. 

At temperatures < -30 C, the display is heat¬ 
ed by switching on the display heating. 




15 

E70 Head-up Display 








PCB 


The following components among others are incorporated on the PCB: 

• K-CAN interface 

• MOST interface 

• Processor (CPU) 

• Graphics controller 

• EEPROM memory 

• Power supply. 

The image information is transferred to 
the master board via the K-CAN and 
MOST. The electronic circuit for image 
generation evaluates the incoming image 
information. The processed image infor¬ 
mation is then forwarded to the display. 

Housing 

The casing is made from plastic and com¬ 
prises a lower section and the cover. The 
cooling (aluminum fins) and the electrical 
power supply are fastened to the lower 
section. The cover glass is integrated into 
the cover. 


Windshield 

The windshield is a "special" windshield and is an integral component vital to projecting 
the displays. The outer and inner glass panes are bonded to a plastic film, just like in the 
standard windshield. Unlike in the standard windshield, this plastic film is not parallel but 
is tapered over the entire area of the windshield. 

The taper prevents the HUD from displaying images twice. The taper tip points downward 
and starts at a distance of about 10 cm to the bottom edge of the windshield. 




16 

E70 Head-up Display 




The end of the taper is located at about 2/3 windshield height. In the top third of the 
windshield, the plastic film runs parallel to the outer and inner glass panes. The thickness 
of the taper tip is 0.8 mm. The thickness of the end of the taper is 1 mm. The total thick¬ 
ness of the bottom edge of the windshield is 4.5 mm. 

The total thickness of the bottom edge of the windshield is 4.5 mm. The total thickness 
of the top edge of the windshield is 4.7 mm.

Incorrect Windshield Fitted 


The HUD image is always reflected on the inner surface and outer surface of the wind¬ 
shield. 

Because of the angle of tilt of the glass in a standard windshield, the two reflected images 
are offset against one another. These two images are overlaid by the angle of the taper in 
the HUD screen, so that the driver only sees "one" image.

Light Module 

The light module LM makes the terminal 58g signal available via the K-CAN. 

Rain/light Sensor 

The rain and light sensor provides the brightness signal over the LIN bus to the roof 
unction center FZD and then to the K-CAN. 

Junction Box 

The Junction Box JB has the gateway function. 

Eye Box 

The Eye box is the space in which the driver can move without his view of the image 
in the HUD being impaired. 

The freedom of movement within the Eye box is roughly: 

• 70 mm vertically plus ± 30 mm range of adjustment 

• 130 mm horizontally 

• The HUD image is not clearly visible outside the Eye box limits

Image Sources 

The following control units provide content for display in the HUD: 

• Central Head unit And Multimedia Platform CHAMP/Car Communication 
Computer (CCC) 

• Instrument cluster (KOMBI) 

• Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

CHAMP/CCC 

The CHAMP/CCC provides the following signal content via the MOST for the 
navigation of the vehicle: 

• Next road/street 

• Guidance arrows 

• Distance to next intersection/turn-off 

• Bar graph, also called the bar display 

20 

E70 Head-up Display 








The navigation signals are output on an event driven basis. The display in the HUD goes 
out if no more navigation signals are output. 

As soon as navigation signals are present again, they are displayed again in the HUD with 
a brief delay. 

Instrument Cluster 

The instrument cluster makes the following signal information available via the K-CAN. 

• Road speed 

• Check Control messages 

• Language/unit. 

The road-speed signal is output by the instrument cluster. 

The display in the HUD goes out if the display signal is no longer output for a specified 
period. 

" — " is displayed in the HUD instead of the speed reading. The lack of the road-speed 
signal is entered in the HUD fault memory. 

As soon as the road-speed signal is present again, it is displayed again in the HUD with a 
brief delay. 

A distinction is made between acceleration/ braking and coasting phases in order to filter 
the speed reading. 

When the car is in the coasting phase, 3 successive values are averaged and then the 
speed is updated. 

Check Control Messages 

All CC messages are also displayed in the HUD. The instrument cluster has the master 
function for the messages. The symbol together with the associated text is stored in the 
HUD. CC messages are displayed as a matter of priority ahead of other displays such as 
for example, navigation instructions. 

Note: A CC message is shown for 23 seconds. If several CC messages are to be 
displayed simultaneously, each CC message is shown for 3 seconds. 


21 

E70 Head-up Display 



Controls 

The following controls are used in the operation of the HUD: 

• On/Off button in the light switch cluster 

• Dimmer wheel in the light switch cluster 

• Controller. 

Light Switch Center 

The HUD On/Off button is located in the 
light switch cluster. The button is resis¬ 
tance-coded and routed directly to the 
HUD. The HUD can identify the button sig¬ 
nals or a button fault using the resistance 
coding. 



Instrument-lighting Dimming 

The dimmer setting is also used for the 
HUD with active headlights. The dimmer 
signal is emitted by the light module. 



Controller 

The HUD brightness and height settings are adjusted with the Controller via the CID. 
Brightness setting is also termed brightness offset. 

Functions such as navigation can also be set with the Controller in the Function selection 
menu. Therefore these settings have an indirect effect on the HUD display.

E70 Head-up Display 





Service Information 

The following information for the technician is described in this section: 

• Adjusting the brightness 

• Adjusting the height of the horizon on the HUD 

• Vertical rotation of the image 

• Test functions 

• Replacing the HUD 

• HUD

Adjusting the Height of the Horizon 

In the E70, the driver has the ability to adjust the location of the image and the Eye box to 
his needs using the Drive controller. 

The Eye box can be shifted up to a maximum of ± 30 mm upwards or downward. The 
height setting is adjusted as follows: 


Note: The height can only be adjusted when the HUD is active. 


• Call up the main menu by 
pressing the menu button 

• Press the Controller and 
select the "Settings" menu 
item 

• Turn the Controller until 
"Displays/Screen" is high¬ 
lighted in the menu bar and 
then confirm by pressing the 
Controller; the upper menu 
bar is activated 


Head Up Display ► 
◄ Brightness / Position ► 



• Turn the Controller until "Position" is highlighted in the upper bar and then confirm 

• Set the desired height by turning the Controller and confirm by pressing. 


The height adjustment is in the scope of the PIA. The setting is stored in the EEPROM 
for each key. If a radio remote control key status message is received with terminal 30 on, 
the mirror moves to the position set for the current key. 


The mirror remains in this position until the HUD is switched on. If the HUD is switched 
off by a press on the On/Off button, the mirror travels to the lower and position to protect 
the display. 


Vertical Rotation of the HUD 


The HUD is supplied as standard with a defined basic setting. The HUD image can be 
rotated in the horizontal by a service technician using vertical rotation, after a change of 
windshield, for instance. 

Note: The display can be adjusted by a motor in steps of 0.25° from -3° to +3°. 
Detailed information may be found in the BMW diagnostic system.

Image 1 is compressed widthways. Image 2 is displayed twice. Images 3 and 4 are 
distorted. 


Fading 

The incidence of light onto the windshield 
or into the HUD in an inconvenient situa¬ 
tion causes the image to fade. 


Correcting Distortion (warping) 

Should the image be distorted after a 
change of windshield, the image display 
can be improved using the Warping func¬ 
tion. Warping is the technical term for the 
improvement of the image display. 

Note: It is only possible to adjust the head-up display vertically (rotation) and 
correct the image in the event of distortion (warping) using the BMW 
diagnostic system. Detailed information on the subject of Warping may 
be found in the BMW diagnostic system.
