Introduction to Information & Communication Technology 


Information and Communication Technology refers to various systems in the vehicle that 
that inform or entertain the driver and passengers. 

Depending on the equipment configuration (BMW Assist), the IKT also serves the 
purpose of making available servicing-relevant data and sending messages in the 
case of emergency. 

For the first time in this vehicle class, a fibre optics-based bus is used for data transmis¬ 
sion in information and communication applications (IKT). This bus is the so-called 
MOST (Media Orientated Systems Transport) bus as already used on the E65, E60 and 
E63/4. 

In this section you will be informed about the information and communication technolo¬ 
gy available in the new BMW3 Series (E90). It deals with the following topics: 

• Audio systems 

• Navigation systems 

• Telephone systems 

• Voice recognition systems

Audio Systems 


Two audio sources are offered on the E90. Both are on the MOST bus and have CD 
playing capabilities. 

The base version utilizes a single cd drive and a dual LCD line readout and is referred to 
as the RAD2 (‘Professional’ radio). This audio system can be ordered as a HiFi system 
with 180 Watt capability or upgraded to Top-HiFi Logic7 with 420 Watts of power. 

The second audio source is the familiar Car Communication Computer (CCC or 
Navigation system, Professional). Because the CCC does not have an LCD readout, 
it utilized the CID as a visual monitor. A vehicle equipped with CCC will always come 
with the Top-HiFi Logic7 system with 420 Watts of power as standard. 

The following new features have been introduced: 

• New 'Professional' radio with MOST capabilities (RAD2 and CCC) 

• Additional audio input for external devices 

• Playback of MP3 files (RAD2 Directly / CCC with CD Changer)

‘Professional’ Radio (Rad2) 

The 'Professional' radio is a new radio for the MOST system network. 

The radio combines the following features: 

• Player for CD/MP3/WMA files • Built in single radio tuner 

• Most bus gateway to the K-CAN • Liquid crystal display 

• Board computer readout • Personal profile management 

The MP3 directory structure is the same as that of a PC. Up to 8 directory levels can be 

represented. A maximum of 255 directories and a total of 999 music tracks per CD can 
be managed. 



Navigation System, Professional 

The 'Professional' navigation system is based on the CCC (car communication comput¬ 
er), the functions of which are already familiar from the E60 and E63/4. 

The CCC combines the following control units in one housing: 

• Navigation computer/GPS module; Map display and/or arrow view on CID (split 
screen) 

• RDS double tuner 

• Audio system controller (ASK) 

• MOST gateway 

• Interface to control display (LVDS) 

• DVD player 

• CD player 

When the navigation system is not in use, its DVD drive can be used to play audio CDs. 
Together with the controller and CID, the CCC forms the iDrive system. 



E90 Communication 

































Amplifiers and Speakers 

The audio systems in the E90 offers two choices: 

• HiFi system -10 speakers w/separate amplifier 

• Top-HiFi system (Logic7) -13 speakers w/Logic7 amplifier 

In addition to the higher achievable sound pressure, the audio systems are also distin¬ 
guished by the improved system fidelity. For the customer, the additional features such as 
the 7-band graphic equalizer and the spatial sound (Logic7) provide both visible as well 
as audible added value. 

The central basses are located under the front seats. They are coupled to the side sills, 
thus enlarging the resonance volume necessary for bass reproduction. 

The stereo, HiFi and Top-HiFi systems exhibit different performance features in terms of 
symmetry of the sound field, sound pressure and fidelity of the frequency response.

■ HiFi System 

The analogue 6-channel 'HiFi' amplifier has the same technical specifications as the one 
fitted in the E83. In the E90, however, it features settings specific to the E90 (diplexers, 
equalizing). 

The HiFi amplifier is located behind the rear left side panel trim in the luggage compart¬ 
ment. 

The audio signals are transmitted in analog form from the radios or navigation systems to 
the HiFi amplifier. This amplifier amplifies the signals and transfers them to the speakers. 

A total of 10 speakers are driven by 6 audio channels: 

• A high-range and mid-range speaker in each front door 

• A tweeter and a mid-range speaker on each side of the rear shelf 

• A central bass speaker under each front seat

Top-HiFi System 

The digital 'Top-HiFi' amplifier with Logic7 (Surround Sound) is of identical design to that 
used in the E60 and the E63/4. This amplifier is a MOST bus node and can be operated 
only with radios or navigation systems with MOST capabilities. 

The audio signals are sent in digital form via the fibre-optic cable (MOST bus) from the 
radio or navigation systems to the 'Top-HiFi' amplifier. The amplifier converts the digital 
signals to analogue signals, amplifies them and routes them to the speakers. 

The sound adjustment (7-band equalizer, spatial sound, fader etc.) takes place prior to the 
analogue conversion in the digital signal processor (DSP) of the amplifier. The Top-HiFi 
amplifier is installed in the same location as the HiFi amplifier.

Radio Antennas 

The high-frequency signals from the radio transmitters are received via the rear-window 
aerials (FM1, FM2, FM3 and AM). 

The aerial amplifiers are in the Diversity module. There are separate ones for AM and FM. 

The combined aerial amplifier and Diversity module is located on the headliner above the 
rear window, concealed behind a cover. 

Both aerial amplifiers are supplied with direct current when the radio is switched on (via 
terminal Rad_On). 

The high-frequency signals from the AM and FM aerials are passed via a ribbon cable 
from the rear window to the combined aerial amplifier and Diversity module.

FM Antenna Diversity 

A quadruple FM aerial diversity system is fitted as standard on the E90. 

FM antenna diversity comprises: 

• FM1, FM2 and FM3 aerials 

• FM4 aerial, formed by combining the signals from the FM1 and FM2 aerials 

• FM antenna amplifier with antenna diversity module 

For reasons of space, the rear window of the E90 can accommodate only three FM 
aerials. The FM4 aerial is not a physical component. To improve FM reception, the FM4 
aerial is created by overlaying the HF signals from the FM1 and FM2 aerials. 

The signal quality of the currently selected FM antenna (FM1 to FM4) is evaluated and 
assessed in the diversity module. The next FM antenna is selected if the signal quality of 
the received radio station deteriorates in connection with the active antenna. The 
changeover takes place such that no interruption can be heard. 

The high-frequency signal from the active FM aerial at any particular time is fed by the 
aerial amplifier and Diversity module via a co-axial cable to the tuner in the radio or navi¬ 
gation system. The signal is demodulated in the tuner and output in the form of an audio 
signal through the speakers. 

The radio or navigation system detects that a diversity module is installed and generates 
the changeover voltage Us and the intermediate frequency signal (ZF) necessary for 
diversity operation. The ZF signal is analyzed by the electronic circuitry in the diversity 
module and is a copy of the currently selected radio station transmission on a fixed fre¬ 
quency of 10.7 MHz. 

The changeover between AM reception, FM diversity mode and diagnosis mode is 
effected by means of the DC voltage signal Us. This voltage is generated by the radio and 
used in the diversity module for evaluation purposes. 

Diversity mode is active at Us = 2.5 V. AM mode is active at Us = 0 V, i.e. the FM1 anten¬ 
na is selected. Diagnosis mode is active at Us = 5 V. 

In total, up to three signals are therefore applied on the coaxial cable simultaneously. 

• HF signal (e.g. 87.5-108 MHz) from diversity module to radio 

• Control DC voltage Us from the radio to the diversity module 

• Intermediate frequency (fIF = 10.7 MHz) from the radio to the diversity module as 
the basis for evaluating the quality of the RF signal.

Roof Aerial 

There are two different variants of roof antenna for the E90: 

• Vehicle equipped with TCU - GPS antenna needed for telematic feature 

• Vehicle equipped with SDARS (Satellite Digital Radio Service - Sirius) 

The roof aerial for SDARS reception has a larger housing compared with the version with¬ 
out satellite radio capability. 


Specifically, the roof aerial for all possible equipment options on the US version comprises: 

• Mobile phone aerials 

• Telematic Control Unit (TCU) telephone aerials 

• GPS antenna 

• SDARS aerial for satellite reception 

• SDARS aerial for terrestrial reception

SDARS Satellite Tuner 

The SDARS satellite radio is the same as the satellite tuner fitted on the E60, E61, E63 
and E64. 

It enables reception of digital radio signals. These are of a higher quality that analog trans¬ 
missions. 

Advantages of digital satellite radio: 

• Reception of same radio station across the entire US mainland (excluding Alaska) 

• Digital reception of music, news and talk stations 

• Wide choice of available music genres 

• No commercial breaks 

• Digital signal transmission provides greater immunity to external interference 

Only the SDARS system developed by Sirius Satellite Radio is supported. This uses 
three satellites which follow an elliptical orbit around the Earth. Because of the arrange¬ 
ment of the orbits, there are always two satellites over the reception area. 

In large urban areas where there are obstructions (e.g. tower blocks, tunnels) or in situa¬ 
tions where there are topographical features (e.g. mountains) that block the satellite sig¬ 
nals, terrestrial transmitters are used to relay the signals. 

The separate satellite tuner is necessary because the signals are transmitted in the giga¬ 
hertz band (microwave band). 

The satellite tuner is located in the trunk above the recess, on the left (when viewed from 
the rear) next to the Telematic Control Unit (TCU).

CD Changer 

All E90 vehicles come pre-wired for CD changer. 

The option SA672 for the E90 is a new "CD changer for 6 CDs" (CDC). The CD changer 
is a MOST network node and differs from the MOST-compatible CD changer on the E60 
and E63/4 by virtue of its support for MP3 files and WMA files. 

The CD changer is located behind a flap on the left in the luggage compartment. 

If the vehicle is eguipped with the HiFi audio system, the digital data of the CD is sent via 
the MOST bus to the radio or navigation system. Here they are converted to analog data 
and output via the amplifier and the speakers. 


If a 'Top-HiFi' system (Logic7) is installed, the audio data is transmitted in digital form via 
the MOST bus from the CD changer directly to the Top-HiFi amplifier, from where it is 
output. This direct transmission bypassing the radio and the navigation system is possible 
as data conversion and sound adjustment take place exclusively in the Top-HiFi amplifier. 


The CD changer supports playback of MP3 CDs. The MP3 files are decoded in the CD 
changer. 


Note: Because MP3s are compressed audio files, it can take the player up to 
20 seconds to decompress and read the information from a CD before 
audio is heard. 


The fibre optic conductors for connecting the CD changer are arranged at the fiber optics 
connector in the luggage compartment such that they are not incorporated in the MOST 
ring. After retrofitting a CD changer, the fibre optics conductors for the CD changer 
preparation are unplugged at the fibre optics connector and connected to the MOST ring. 
Coding of the system will be necessary.

E90 Communication 



Audio Jack 

The audio jack (AUX-ln) is used to connect an external audio source such as MP3, cas¬ 
sette, or CD playback devices. It is a standard feature with both the RAD2 and CCC. 

It is located below the center armrest. A 12 V socket outlet is located in the immediate 
vicinity of the audio jack. Connection of the external audio source is provided by means of 
a 3.5 mm latch connector. 

Fine adjustment of the playback volume is possible with the RAD2 radio. The purpose of 
the adjustment is to prevent volume differences that can occur when switching between 
different audio sources. The CCC does not have the line volume balancing option.

• Switch system ON/OFF 

• Disconnect from vehicle electrical system 

• BMW diagnosis system 

There is no button or key combination on the device for performing a reset. 

The 'Professional' navigation system (CCC) can be reset by simultaneously pressing and 
holding the eject buttons on the DVD and CD player and the rotary push-button for 
approximately 10 s. The CID becomes blank. The CCC is then restarted. 

3 The MOST gateway ('Professional' radio, M-ASK or CCC) is muted for 2 s when reset¬ 
ting a MOST control unit. 1 

Interference in Radio Reception 

Check the following in the event of interference in radio reception: 

• Power supply terminal Rad_On for the antenna amplifiers in the diversity module. 

• Antenna connector at diversity module 

• Antenna connector at radio or navigation system 

Note: Care must be taken as the antenna plug connection may be damaged due 
to the restricted package space behind the CCC.

Service Concept 

The following are replaced as complete units: 

• 'Business CD' radio 

• 'Professional' radio 

• 'Business' navigation system (M-ASK) 

The service concept of the CCC permits replacement of individual assemblies. It is based 
on the concept implemented on the E60. The following assemblies can be replaced: 

• Fan 

• CD and DVD player 

• Front panel 

• HIR gyro sensor 

• Tuner/audio board 

Observe the electro-static discharge (ESD) guidelines when replacing components. 

MP3/WMA Playback 

Note: The information provided in the following is of a general nature and not 
specific to BMW. 

MP3 stands for MPEG Layer 3 and is a compression method for audio data which 
achieves very high compression ratios. MP3 makes use of a phenomenon that is associ¬ 
ated with psychoacoustics: Human beings do not hear everything that theoretically could 
be heard - in any case not consciously. Based on the characteristics of human hearing, 
the MP3 inventors at the German Fraunhofer Institute have developed perception-adapt¬ 
ed audio coding whereby part of the digital sound information normally found on the CD 
is simply omitted. These are sounds that most people do not consciously perceive, e.g. 
very high or very low sounds. In addition, components of the sound signals are omitted 
that are of no significance with regard to the sound impression but enabling the very high 
compression values. 

MPEG is the abbreviation for Moving Picture Experts Group. The experts group is an 
organization that has created standards for the compression of film data. The standards 
for audio compression were later added. 

MPEG layer 1 and layer 2 are the predecessors of MP3. They achieve compression rates 
which, however, do not approach those of Layer 3. Layer 1, for example, is used in con¬ 
nection with digital music cassettes and Layer 2 for DAB (Digital Audio Broadcast). All 
three compression methods (Codecs, see below) are downward compatible, i.e. a Layer- 
3 decoder will also play files that are coded in accordance with Layer 1 or Layer 2. 

The computing power for MPEG Layer 1 to 3 is to a high degree asymmetric. This 
means that the computing power for MP3encoding is substantially higher than for MP3 
decoding. 

26 

E90 Communication 




Since all the values achieved during the coding procedure are stored in the MP3 file, the 
work of the decoder is restricted to interpreting these values. All three layers support the 
following sample rates: 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz. As part of MPEG audio coding, a fil¬ 
ter array converts the audio signal to be encoded from the time range to the frequency 
range. During this procedure it is initially subdivided into 32 frequency ranges (sub¬ 
bands). Prior to MPEG Layer 2, all 32 sub-bands had the same width of 625 Hz. Only 
with the advent of Layer 3 have the sub-bands been adapted to the characteristics of the 
human ear (psychoacoustic model). The audio signal subdivided into frequency ranges 
provides the algorithm with distinctly more working area or depth for data reduction than 
the uniform audio signal. 

The MP3 encoder examines each sub-band individually and removes frequencies that 
are deemed dispensable based on the fundamental psychoacoustic model and com¬ 
presses the remaining audio data. 

Bit Rate 

Compression of audio data using the MP3 method reduces the data volume correspond¬ 
ing to the selected target quality to a fraction of the original volume. A decisive factor gov¬ 
erning the music quality of an MP3 file is the data transmission rate - referred to as the bit 
rate. In connection with MP3, the bit rate is measured in kiloBits per second. The higher 
the bit rate, the higher the quality of the result. However, this also increases the size of the 
data volume to be stored.

There are both fixed and variable bit rates which, however, are not supported by all MP3 
players. The traditional method of audio coding CBR (Constant Bit Rate) maintains a con¬ 
stant bit rate during the entire recording. In connection with the variable bit rate method 
(VBR), the bit rate drops to a lower level when a section in a song contains little sound 
information. As a result, the bit rate is frequently reduced to 32 kBit/s or less. In sections 
with large quantities of sound information, the bit rate increases to a specified maximum 
which is normally at 128 or 192 kBit/s. The advantage of the variable bit rate is an overall 
better sound quality with reduced file sizes. 

While MP3 is better suited for coding at higher bit rates, the WMA format (Windows 
Media Audio) is appropriate for lower bit rates. When using WMA format, even recordings 
with a bit rate of only 64 kBit/s sound acceptable. The data loss at a constant bit rate is 
less noticeable than in an MP3 file. However, outstanding bass reproduction at 64 kBit/s 
cannot be achieved in any format. WMA is much better suited than MP3 for ultralow bit 
rates (e.g. 16 kBit/s).

Principles of Operation 

Each satellite transmits messages with the following (simplified) information: 

• Number of the satellite 

• Current position of the satellite 

• Message time 

The satellite additionally broadcasts so-called orbit (path) and almanac data. These orbit 
and almanac data are stored in the navigation system and used for subsequent calcula¬ 
tions to enable fast acquisition of the currently available satellites. Almanac data contain 
information on the orbits of all satellites, time correction factors and atmospheric delay 
parameters. 

To determine the position, the GPS data are received by the GPS antenna in the antenna 
base and routed via a coaxial cable to the navigation computer (CCC). The GPS data are 
decoded. 

To determine the location, the navigation system compares the time at which the signal 
was sent with the time at which the signal was received. The distance of the satellite can 
be calculated from this time difference. The time calculations are based on a highly accu¬ 
rate atomic clock (UTC: Universal Time Coordinated). 

The current position can now be determined by adding measurements from other 
satellites. The GPS receiver can determine its position on the earth's surface with the 
aid of at least three satellites. This process is known as "2D position fix". Two dimensional 
because the receiver must assume that it is located directly on the earth's surface. The 
absolute spatial position can be determined with the aid of four or more satellites ("3D 
position fix"). The altitude is necessary, for example, on multi-tier road junctions and 
intersections. 

Note: A clear view of the sky is necessary for the reception of GPS data. Rain or 
snow normally do not interfere with reception. However, a very dense 
cover of wet leaves or shadow areas such as high-sided buildings, rows 
of trees may impair reception. 

In addition, depending on the time of day, there may be fluctuations in 
satellite reception at one location during a 24 hour period (example: 
Munich 5-10 satellites). This is due to the orbits of the satellites. 

From these satellite signals, the navigation system calculates 

• longitude 

• latitude 

• altitude from the satellite data. 

Based on repeated measurements, the direction of movement and speed can also be 
calculated by way of GPS. 


33 

E90 Communication 



Navigation Mode 

The present position is known at the start of the journey as it is either still stored or is 
checked/established at the time. When the vehicle is being driven, the navigation system 
receives the "distance covered" information from the DSC control unit via the bus (PT- 
CAN/junction box control unit/K-CAN). 

The travel data from the wheel speed sensors is transmitted as a bus message. It is 
broadcast on the PT-CAN by the DSC. From there it is transferred to the K-CAN by the 
junction box control unit and passed to the navigation system. 

The rear left wheel speed sensor supplies the information necessary for this purpose to 
the DSC control unit. If that wheel speed sensor fails, the rear right wheel speed sensors 
takes over. 

The gyro sensor determines any changes in direction such as when cornering. Changes 
in altitude are not detected by the two dimensional gyro sensor. The current position can 
be determined by combined evaluation of the "distance covered" and "driving direction". 
The position calculated in this way is compared to the navigation data stored on the DVD. 

If considerable deviations occur (incorrect calculations due to inaccurate sensor data, out¬ 
dated map data), priority is given to the current position determined by the GPS. During 
normal operation, the position is therefore determined during navigation operation based 
on correspondingly processing the wheel speed and yaw rate sensor information. 

Thefootwell module makes available the "reversing" information in the form of a bus 
message to the navigation system and this information is taken into account in the posi¬ 
tion calculation. 

On manual transmission vehicles, the reverse gear switch is located on the manual gear¬ 
box. 

On automatic transmission vehicles, the reverse gear information is provided by the trans¬ 
mission control unit that detects the status of the selector lever position switch. 

After the navigation computer has been disconnected from the power supply, it can take 
up to 10 minutes before the navigation system determines the current position as an 
update of the almanac data and the received satellite data is necessary in this case. 

Delayed positioning can also occur after longer parking periods (e.g. holidays). The fol¬ 
lowing aids are available for route guidance purposes: 

• Display of current position on the screen 

• Direction arrows as orientation for further road routing 

• Distance information up to the next change in direction (turn off) 

• Voice announcements for further route guidance 

• Distance to destination 

• Route list and destination list 

• Calculated route indicated by a white line to the destination in the map presentation

Service Information 


DVD 

The navigation DVD of the 'Professional' navigation system (CCC) are compatible with 
other vehicles (e.g. E60) with the same equipment (CCC). 

Note: If the navigation DVD is not recognized although the correct DVD is loaded in the 
player, the DVD should be removed and reinserted. 

Media Ejection 

If the navigation DVD is not ejected during normal operation by pressing the Eject button, 
carry out the following procedure: 

• Reset CCC 

• Press the Eject button several times during start-up 

Alternatively, the system reset can be activated by means of the BMW diagnosis system 
(control unit functions). 

Note: If a DVD does not want to eject from the CCC, Do NOT FORCE it out. 

No mechanical emergency release is provided on the DVD player to 
remove media. 

Start-Up 

After disconnecting the battery, due to the necessary data transmission, it may take up to 
10 minutes before the navigation system correctly displays the current position.

Voice Recognition System 


The E90 has two different variants of voice control: 

• Internal of the TCU 

• Internal of the CCC 

TCU 

Voice control for telephone functions comes as standard with all telephone systems. The 
voice control capability is achieved by means of software on the telephone control unit. 

Voice control comprises the telephone function and a voice-controlled phone book that 
is separate from the address book on the mobile phone. Up to 50 names and telephone 
numbers can be stored. 

The telephone book managed by means of voice control cannot be transferred to the 
mobile phone. 

Note: The notepad function previously available with the ULF is not available 
on the E90. 

The microphone for voice control of the telephone is located in the roof functions center 
on the driver's side. It is connected to the telephone control unit. 

CCC 

A more comprehensive voice recognition system is available with the option SA609 
('Professional' navigation system) as the voice recognition system is realized as software 
in the CCC. 

Many of the functions that are otherwise selected via the controller in the CID can be 
operated by means of voice commands. 

The microphone is located in the roof functions center on the passenger's side and is 
connected directly to the CCC. 

The language of the voice recognition system cannot be changed in the CID. The lan¬ 
guage that can be selected in the CID (one of three languages) refers only to the display 
text and the announcement language for the navigation system. 

During the CCC programming procedure, the language of the voice recognition system 
is programmed corresponding to the vehicle order (country assignment). The language 
cannot be easily changed over as for the display language due to the size of the software 
package.
