All control units belonging to the safety system have been replaced due to the fact that 
the Advanced Safety Electronics (ASE) and the optical bus system byteflight are no 
longer installed. The previous functions have been adopted by new control units. 

A central control unit, i.e. the Advanced Crash and Safety M anagement (ACSM) module 
has been integrated in the K-CAN forfunctions of the passive safety system. 

The safety and gateway module SGM has been replaced by the body-gateway module 
KGM .The body-gateway module incorporates not only parts of the SGM but also the 
door modules and the micro-power module M PM. 

The installation location in the units carrier behind the glove compartment is the same. 

Functions that have been adopted from the SGM in the KGM and have no changes are 
briefly described in the following. 

New or expanded functions are described in the "Functions" section.

System Overview 

Gateway 

The KGM contains the gateway function and provides the interface between following 
busses: 

• D-bus, diagnostic bus 

• PT-CAN, powertrain CAN 

• K-CAN, bodyCAN 

• LIN-bus, local interconnect network 

The task ofthe gateway is to interconnect the various bus systems. 

The bus systems differ in terms of their data transmission rate or data telegram structure. 

The data telegrams are buffered in the gateway and forwarded corresponding to their 
priority. 

In connection with the diagnostic bus, the KGM forms the interface to the BM W diag¬ 
nostic units and forthe purpose of diagnosing or programming all control units connect¬ 
ed to the bus system. 

The KGM additionally features a link to the LIN-bus forthe purpose of reading informa¬ 
tion from the driver's door switch cluster.

Servotronic 


The Servotronic controls the steering forces as a function of the driving speed. More 
steering assistance is provided when the vehicle is stationary or when parking than when 
driving at high speed on the motorway. 

The Servotronic control function as well as the output stage for activating the Servotronic 
valve is integrated in the KGM if the vehicle is not equipped with AFS. 

If the vehicle is equipped with AFS, the functional control is performed by the AFS 
control unit. 

ECO Valve 

An ECO valve (electrically controlled orifice) is installed in the hydraulic pump on vehicles 
equipped with active steering. The KGM controls ECO valve operation in the hydraulic 
pump forthe power steering. The ECO valve controls the volumetric flow of the hydraulic 
pump corresponding to the power steering requirement, thus reducing fuel consumption. 

Modifications to the System Network 

Fundamental changes to the system network will be introduced on the BMW 5 Series 
and BMW 6 Series as from model year 2006. 

Changing the passive safety system ASE to the advanced crash and safety management 
(AC S M) and the fact that the optical bus system byteflight is no longer installed result in 
several changes to the bus overview. 

Following control units have been replaced: 

• Safety and gateway module (SGM) 

• B-pillar satellite, left 

• B-pillar satellite, right 

• Driver's door module (TM FA) 

• Passenger's doormoduleTMBF) 

• Vehicle Center Satellite (SFZ) 

• Micro-Power Module MPM) 

The previous control unit functions have been integrated in new control units. 

The steering column switch clusterthat was previously connected to the system network 
via the byteflight is now connected to the PT-C AN. 

The steering column switch cluster features extensive modifications and is therefore a 
new component.

Functions 


Power Supply 

There are a few modifications to the power supply system, i.e. battery, alternator, starter, 
power distribution box, ignition lock. 

The previous ignition lock with key-operated switch has been dropped and replaced by 
a Start-Stop button with terminal control.The Start-Stop button is described in detail in 
the section "Comfort access". 

There are no changes to the battery, alternator and the starter. 

The following changes have been made to the rear power distribution box: 

• The mounting forthe battery cable supplying powerto the front power distribution 
box has been changed to a RADSOK contact. 

• The high-current fuses are locked in the housing and cannot be replaced separately. 
No changes have been made to the power distribution box at the front.

E6x 9/05 Model Updates 












The advantages of RADSOK contacts are in their 
design. The contact surface of the connector is 
equipped with spring elements. 

The connection itself is not rigid but rather flexible. 

The high currents and resulting increase in tempera¬ 
ture caused by the spring elements and the move¬ 
ment of the connector produce a self-cleaning effect 
of the contact surface. This ensures very good and RADSOKConnectorwith 
uniform powertransmission in connection with low spring Elements 
contact resistance. 



Rear Power Distribution Box with RADSOKContact 

The rear power distribution box is equipped with a 
RADSOK contact for connecting the battery cable 
leading to the front power distribution box. RADSOK 
contacts are known and have already been used on 
the E65 power module. 


High Current Fuses 

The high-current fuses are located on the underside of the power distribution box. The 
high-current fuses areforthe: 

• Front power distribution box 

• Common rail orValvetronic 

• PTC auxiliary heater 

The high-current fuses are connected directly to the battery. On the connector side, the 
high-current fuses are crimped to the power distribution box and cannot be replaced indi¬ 
vidually. The complete power distribution box must be replaced in the event of a defective 
fuse.

Energy Management 

Comprehensive measures have been introduced with the aim of further increasing cus¬ 
tomer satisfaction and to solve the problem of flat batteries. A flat battery is an annoying 
event for the customer. 

There are various causes. Possible examples include: 

• Unfavorable driving profile 

- Predominantly short-distance driving with insufficient battery charging (especially 
in winter) 

• Increased closed-circuit current (> 80 mA) 

- Control unit is awake internally, the battery discharges afterthe vehicle has been 
parked several days. 

• Sleep mode preventer (approximately 10 A) 

- A control unit does not sign off and the entire bus system remain awake. The bat¬ 
tery is discharged after a few hours. 

• Bus wake-up event 

- The bus system assumes sleep mode but is repeatedly woken by a control unit. 
The battery is generally discharged within one day. 

Extensive measures have been implemented in the area of the energy management in 
orderto counteract these problems. The measures concern following changes: 

• Time-controlled terminal shut-down (terminal 30g) 

- All control units that need not necessarily be connected to terminal 30 are discon¬ 
nected from the battery after a maximum of 60 minutes. 

• Terminal shut-down in response to fault (terminal 30g_f) 

- Electric loads must switch off on request. If they do not switch off they will be dis¬ 
connected from the battery. 

• Sleep mode preventers 

- Control units that have not signed off and the sleep indicator bit is not set. 

• Bus wake-up 

- Control units that wake up the bus system unauthorized. 

The micro-power module and the energy data memory have been integrated in the body 
gateway module to facilitate these measures. 


14 

E6x 9/05 Model Updates 



Energy Data Memory 

The energy data memory is the expansion of the previous history memory as was used in 
the SGM. An indicator as to what bus system woke the vehicle was stored in the history 
memory. 

The expanded function of the energy data memory determines: 

• Which control unit prevents the bus system from assuming sleep mode 

• How often a control unit wakes the bus system and therefore the entire vehicle 

• Which control unit has woken the bus system and therefore the entire vehicle 

The energy data memory is subdivided into three areas containing following information: 

• Sleep mode preventer 

• Numberof bus wake-ups 

• ID of bus wake-ups 

A further processor, the co-processor, is necessary for this purpose. Since the body gate¬ 
way module (KGM) itself assumes sleep mode and the main processor is therefore 
switched off, it would not at all notice a short bus wakeup event. It is therefore necessary 
to permanently monitorthe bus sleep phase with a further processor. The identifier is 
stored in response to a bus telegram. 

Besides the ID of the CAN telegram, the km reading and the relative time are also stored. 
Conclusions with regard to the driving profile and the stationary periods can be drawn 
with the aid of these data. This facilitates more simple and accurate diagnosis of the con¬ 
trol unit causing the problem. 

Furthermore, the system is able to determine which control unit prevents the bus system 
assuming sleep mode. 

Sleep Mode Preventers 

After terminal R OFF, control units must sign off from their network master (KGM, CCC, 
MASK) and signal their readiness to assume sleep mode. 

All control units that signal that they are ready to assume sleep mode by setting the sleep 
indicator bit 20 minutes afterterminal R OFF are classified as sleep preventers. 

The diagnostic address of the respective control unit is used forthe purpose of identify¬ 
ing the cause. 

The same procedure applies aftera bus wakeup without terminal R ON. 

Monitoring by the body-gateway module takes place at 5,10,15, 20 minutes aftertermi- 
nal R OFF. All control units found 3 times not to have assumed sleep mode are entered 
as sleep mode preventers in the data memory. 

As part of its gateway function, the KGM is generally the last control unit to set the sleep 
indicator bit. It is entered as a sleep mode preventer only when it is the only control unit 
that has not yet signalled its readiness to assume sleep mode. 


15 

E6x 9/05 Model Updates 



Bus Wake-Up 

Control units that wake the bus system without authorization and cause a high closed cir¬ 
cuit current are referred to as bus wake-ups. 

The identity of each control unit that sends a bus telegram is stored in the telegram iden¬ 
tifier. Therefore, every telegram can be assigned to a control unit. Data records are creat¬ 
ed for monitoring and recording purposes. 


Recording Data Records 

The recording procedure forthe relative time from the instrument cluster is started when 
battery voltage is applied. The relative time is a consecutive counterthat is started when 
the battery voltage is applied forthe first time at the factory. A new data record is started 
with every battery reset. 

A data record is recorded over 1 week (168 h). Afterthe 168 hours have elapsed, the 
data record is stored and recording of the second data record begins. 


All statuses between two terminal R switch-on operations are recorded. The recording 
takes into account whetherthe terminal 30g relay was ON orOFF. A maximum of 254 
entries can be stored. The counter stops at 254 when the maximum number of 254 
entries is exceeded. The same also applies to the number of recorded trips.

A total of 6 data records are recorded in the ring memory, facilitating subsequent diagno¬ 
sis overthis period in orderto obtain a more accurate overall picture of the driving profile. 

The following information is stored in a data record: 

• Start of recording (relative time) 

• Total distance covered in km up to the next recording 

• N umber of trips of 0 - 5 km 

• Numberoftrips of 5 - 20 km

Identification of Bus Wake-Ups 

When entering the bus wake-up in the data record, the identifier of the bus telegram that 
has woken the bus as well as the relative time and the current km-reading are stored in a 
separate area of the energy data memory. This enables distinct identification of the con¬ 
trol unit that has woken the bus. 

Micro-Power Module Integrated in KGM 

There is no micro-power module as a separate control unit. The entire function, including 
the bistable relay terminal 30g_f has been integrated in the body-gateway module. The 
relay terminal 30g_f is soldered on the pc board. The ON/OFF statuses of the relay are 
stored in the KGM.

electric loads are requested to switch themselves off if the closed-circuit current is too 
high and the start capability limit of the battery is reached. An after running time of 2min- 
utes is coded forthis purpose. A reset is implemented if the closed-circuit current is still 
too high after 2 minutes or one of the following conditions applies.

relay.This is intended to eliminate any malfunctions in the control unit. 

Reset conditions 

• Closed-circuit current of electric loads too high 

• Bus active for 60 minutes even though no switch-on condition applies 

• Bus is woken 30 times even though no switch-on condition applies 

The terminal 30g_f relay is switched off for 10 seconds and then switched on again as 
part of the reset procedure. The system is monitored again afterthe reset. 

Switch-Off ofTerminal 30g_f Relay 

Terminal 30g_f relay is opened (OFF) if one of the following conditions applies during the 
monitoring phase. 

• Start capability limit reached 

• 5 bus wake-up events with no switch-on condition 

• 10 min. bus activity 

The switch-off or reset is stored in the info memory of the KGM .The following informa¬ 
tion is also stored: 

• Current kilometer reading 

• Relative time 

• Status of relay (ON/OFF) 

• Counterthat indicates how often the relay is switched on

Comfort Access 


As from 09/2005 the E60, E61, E63 and E64 can be equipped with the comfort access 
system (can be ordered as an option). These models therefore also feature "keyless" 
access. 

These models will also be equipped with following components: 

• START/STOP button 

• S lot for identification transmitter 

• Electric steering column lock 

• Car access system 2 (adopted from E90) 

Note: Comfort access is based on the comfort access system from the E90 
and E91 On vehicles equipped with comfort access, the CAS 2 has the 
master function for comfort access. 

Control Unit 

The comfort access control unit is installed in the units carrier behind the glove compart¬ 
ment. The electronic module forthe comfort access system is accommodated in a hard¬ 
shell housing. The connector socket has 26 pins. The fuses forthe comfort access sys¬ 
tem are located in the power distribution box behind the glove compartment. 

With the exception of the antennas forthe outer door handles which are activated direct¬ 
ly by the respective electronic outer door handle module, all antennas are connected 
directly to the comfort access control unit. 

The comfort access control unit, electronic outer door handle modules and the car 
access system 2 are interconnected by the CAS-bus. 

The CAS-bus is a bus system based on the K-bus. Faults in the electronic outer door 
handle modules are stored in the fault code memory of the comfort access system. 

Comfort access therefore also serves as the diagnostic interface forthe electronic outer 
door handle modules. 

Outer Door Handle 

The previous exterior door handle is retained in full. For comfort access, an electronics 
box is mounted on the inside of the outer door handle. The complete outer door handle 
electronics, the inductive antenna and the capacitive sensor 1 are housed in the elec¬ 
tronics box. The sensitive area on the outer door handles represents the capacitive 
sensor2. 


26 

E6x9/05 Model Updates 




The sensitive area is located directly next to the lock barrel on the driver's door or on the 
fixed part on the outer door handles on the other doors. The Hall sensorfor identifying 
when the outer door handle is pulled is located next to the electronics box. 

The status of the Hall sensor changes when the outer door handle is pulled. This change 
in status is detected by the electronics of the outer door handle. The vehicle is unlocked 
by pulling the outer door handle twice within a short space of time. 

The electronic outer door handle modules are connected via the CAS-bus to comfort 
access, car access 2 and the electric steering lock. 

Depending on the type of vehicle, two to four electronic outer door handle modules can 
be installed forthe comfort access system. See following table:

Capacitive Sensor 1 

The functional principle of the capacitive sensor is already known from the E87/E90/E91. 

The capacitor plate from the outer door handle, however, has been repositioned behind 
the handle plate. The capacitor plate is located in an electronics boxthatis mounted 
directly on the handle plate. 

An electric field is generated in the area of the doorhandle plate of the outer door 
handles. T he electric field is changed by grasping into the recessed plate of the outer 
doorhandle.

Unlocking Steering Column with Comfort Access 

The steering is unlocked undervarious conditions. A fundamental condition required for 
unlocking the vehicle is the detection of a valid identification transmitter in the interior. 

The steering unlocking operation is triggered with the status "terminal R ON". 

Examples of Unlocking the Steering: 

Unlock Steering 

• Driver's door unlocked and opened: 

The steering is unlocked when a valid identification transmitter is detected in the 
vehicle interior 3 seconds after opening the door. 

• Driver's door unlocked and opened: 

If more than 3 seconds has elapsed after opening the driver's door, the search for a 
valid identification transmitter in the vehicle interior is started when the last door of 
the vehicle is closed. The steering is unlocked if the search in the vehicle interioris 
successful. 

• Driver's door unlocked and opened: 

M ore than 3 seconds has elapsed after opening the driver's door and the driver's 
door remains open. Terminal R ON can be selected with the START/STOP button 
and the steering is unlocked. 

• A locked steering can be unlocked by inserting the identification transmitter in its 
slot. 

Locking Steering Column with Comfort Access 

The steering can be locked only under certain conditions. A fundamental condition is 
that the vehicle is stationary and the engine is turned off. The steering locking operation 
is triggered with the status "terminal R OFF". 

Examples of Locking the Steering: 

Locking Steering 

• Terminal 15 OFF with the START/STOP button followed by the central arrest 
command of the central locking system. The central arrest can be triggered with the 
remote control in the identification transmitter or via the "lock" capacitive sensor at 
the outer door handle. 

• The steering can be locked by removing the identification transmitter from its slot. 

Replacement of the Steering Column 

If defective, the electric steering column lock can be replaced on the electrically 
adjustable steering column. The electric steering column lock is included in the scope 
of delivery of a new steering column.

E6x 9/05 Model Updates 



START/STOP Button 


The START/STOP button has been adopted from the E90 and adapted to the vehicle 
design. The START/STOP button features two Hall sensors. With the aid of the Hall sen¬ 
sors, the car access system 2 registers when the START/STOP button is pressed. Button 
operation can still be detected if one of the Hall sensors fails. 

The lighting of the START/STOP button is powered bythe car access system 2. 

Slot 

The slot forthe identification transmitter has been adopted 
from the E90 but is now installed on the steering column 
switch cluster.The slotfeatures two Hall sensors. 

One Hall sensor detects when the identification transmitter 
is inserted and locked in position. The other registers when 
the identification transmitter is ejected/removed. 

The electric lock of the inserted identification transmitter is 
also located in the slot. 

The car access system 2 evaluates the Hall sensors of the 
slot. 

Car Access System 2 (CAS 2) 

The car access system 2 is the master control unit for comfort access. The car access 
system 2 checks the requests triggered bythe comfort access system. 

For example, the car access system 2 enables activation of the central locking or of the 
electric steering column lock. The car access system 2 is also responsible forthe engine 
start enable. 

The CAS-bus is used forthe communication between car access system 2 and comfort 
access. 

The CAS-bus is a bus system based on the K-bus.

Central Locking 


The central locking system is described in the following based on the example of the 
E60.The description briefly outlines the changes to the central locking system in the 
models E61, E63 and E64. 

The central locking system is a distributed function. The control units that make up the 
system are the: 

• CAS 2 

• KGM 

• KBM 

The car access system 2 CAS 2 is the masterforthe central locking system. On vehi¬ 
cles with comfort access CA, this control unit is also involved in the central locking sys¬ 
tem. 

Communication between CAS 2, KBM, KGM and CA takes place via the K-CAN. 

Body Gateway Module (KGM) 

With the aid of two double relays, the KGM controls the central locking of the front 
doors. The double relays are integrated in the KGM. The KGM registers the status of the 
central locking drive units and makes this status available via the K-CAN. 

The statuses are: 

• Central locking unlocked ER 

• Central locking locked VR 

• Central locking arrested (double locked) 

The KGM evaluates the status of the door contacts (Hall sensors) in the front doors. The 
KGM makes available, via the K-CAN, the status of the door contacts to other users in 
the system network. 

The status of the Hall sensors in the lock barrel of the driver's door is also evaluated by 
the KGM and sent via the K-CAN.

Interior Lighting 


Doors 

Together with the interior lighting master, the KGM controls the light functions in the 
front doors. The masterforthe interior lighting is the basic body module. The KGM 
therefore receives the request to switch the door light functions on or off via the K-CAN. 

The KGM is responsible forthe following lighting systems: 

• Door exit light • Courtesy lighting 

• Sill lighting on the E63 • Driver's door switch cluster 

Door Exit Light 

Depending on the coding of the KGM, the door exit lights can be switched on either via 
the Soft ON/Soft OFF function ordirectly.To avoid fluctuations in the brightness, the 
door exit lights are activated pulse-width modulated by means of driver output stages. 

The KGM monitors the door exit lights for shorts to ground. A temperature protection 
facility is included in the driver output stages. A fault code is entered in the KGM as soon 
as the triggering temperature is reached. 

Courtesy Light 

The courtesy lighting in the outside mirror is controlled by the KGM via the LIN bus. The 
lighting can be switched on or off either via the Soft ON/Soft OFF function or directly. 

The courtesy lighting is not activated at terminal 15 ON. 

Sill Lighting E63 

The sill lighting is connected in parallel to the output forthe door exit light. 

Driver's Door Switch Cluster 

The buttons in the driver's door switch cluster are eliminated by means of locator light¬ 
ing, terminal 58g orthe function indicator. 

The function lighting is based on the brightness value of the photosensor in the instru¬ 
ment cluster. 

The instrument cluster makes available the brightness value via the K-CAN. In connec¬ 
tion with the LIN-bus, the KGM controls the function lighting of a pressed button (e.g. 
child safety lock, "All windows" button E64). 

Backlighting (terminal 58g) 

Various lights in the front doors are operated directly by the lights module in connection 
with terminal 58g. These lighting functions are: 

• Handle plate light • Storage compartment light 

• Driver's door switch cluster • Passenger's power window switch 


40 

E6x9/05 Model Updates 




PowerWindows 


Front Windows 

The control of the powerwindows is distributed over 3 control units. These control units 
are the CAS 2, KGM, and KBM. 

The car access system CAS is the master control unitforthe powerwindow function. 

Communication between CAS 2, KBM, and KGM takes place via the K-CAN. 

The Convertible top module CVM makes further information available via the K-CAN for 
operation of the powerwindows on the E64. 

Body Gateway Module (KGM) 

The body-gateway module KGM evaluates the front powerwindow switch on the pas¬ 
senger's side and the driver's door switch cluster. The following power window functions 
are integrated in the KGM: 

• Control and monitoring of the direction of rotation of the powerwindow motors in 
OPEN orCLOSED direction. 

• Toll function 

• Convenient opening and convenient closing 

• Anti-trapping function 

• Disabling powerwindow operation at terminal 50. 

Body Basic Module (KBM) 

The basic body module KBM controls the powerwindows in the rear doors. 

Convertible Top Module (CVM) E64 

The KGM receives additional requests from the driver's door switch cluster, concerning 
the Convertible top system. 

These requests are: 

All windows and rearwindow OPEN orCLOSED (only E64 Convertible top module 
CVM) 

• Rear window OPEN orCLOSED 

The requests, e.g. OPEN orCLOSE rearwindow, are sent via the K-CAN to the CVM. 
The CVM controls the movement of the rearwindow. 

When opening orclosing the convertible top, the KGM receives, via the K-CAN, the 
request to lowerthe windows from the CVM .The KGM completely lowers the front win¬ 
dows. 


41 

E6x 9/05 Model Updates 




A closed side window reliably prevents draughts from the vehicle exterior. The window of 
the respective door is lowered when opening the driver's or passenger's door, thus allow¬ 
ing the doors to be opened. 

The window is also closed after closing the doorto again provide reliable protection 
against draughts. 

Lowering the S ide Window E63 

As on the E64, the window is lowered slightly when the driver's or passenger's door is 
opened. The window is also closed after closing the door 

The "easy entry" function can be set in the personal profile. After activating this function, 
the windows are opened by as much as 75% after unlocking twice within 2 seconds and 
after opening the door.

Outside Mirrors 

Mirror Control 

The mirrors are connected via the LIN-bus.The electronic mirror module controls the 
mirrors. 

The signal progression for the driver's outside mirror is as follows: 

• From the KGM via the LIN-bus to the driver's door switch cluster 

• From the driver's doorswitch clustervia the LIN-bus to the electronic mirror module 

• The electronic mirror module controls the mirror adjustment motors. 

The signal progression for the passenger's outside mirror is as follows: 

• From the KGM via the LIN-bus to the electronic mirror module 

• The electronic mirror module controls the mirror adjustment motors.

Bus. 

The mirrorfolding function can be triggered manually using the convenient closing/open¬ 
ing function. 

3 The convenient closing function can be coded. 1 

Electrochromic Mirrors 

The KGM receives the signal for the EC mirror function directly from the interior rear-view 
mirror. The KGM evaluates the signal from the interior rear-view mirror and forwards the 
request via the LIN-bus to the outside mirrors. 

The electronic mirror module carries out the request. 

MirrorMemory 

The KGM evaluates the signals from the electronic mirror module and stores the value in 
the KGM. 

Automatic Parking (curb viewer) Function 

The passenger's side mirror is turned downward when reverse gear is engaged, thus pro¬ 
viding a better view of the curb. The automatic parking function (curb viewer) is available 
together with the mirror memory.

Steering Column Switch Cluster 


A new steering column switch cluster will be installed in the models E60/E61/E63 and 
E64 as from 09/2005. This steering column switch cluster represents a combination of 
technologies that are already familiar from various predecessor models: 

• As on the E87/E90, the steering angle is acquired by optical means. 

• As on the E60/E65 models, the steering column stalks are equipped with 
electric buttons. 

The two control units previously responsible forthis system (electronic steering wheel 
module LRE and electronic steering column module LSE) have been combined in one 
control unit (steering column switch cluster).

As on the E65/E60 models, the switch positions of the steering column stalks forwipers, 
direction indicators and cruise control are registered electrically and forwarded to the 
SZL control unit. The information from the switches and steering angle sensor are 
processed in the SZL control unit and transferred to other systems via the F-CAN or PT- 
CAN.The driver's airbag is connected to the ACSM control unit.

Electronic Steering Column Switch Cluster Module 

The electronic steering column switch cluster module contains a processor, the power 
supply and following interfaces: 

• F-CAN 

• PT-CAN 

• Electrical switches 

• Horn 

• SMG (M-Sport) 

• Redundant lines for direction indicators 

The optical sensorfor measuring the steering angle is integrated in the pc-board of the 
control unit. 


F-CAN Link 

The SZL is connected via the F-CAN to the control units DSC and active steering AL. 

All necessary information relating to the running gear is made available via the F-CAN. 

PT-CAN Link 

In addition to the link to the F-CAN, the SZL also features an interface to the PT-CAN. 
Using this interface, the SZL control unit can send switch information (direction indicators, 
wipers, cruise control, multifunction steering wheel) to the corresponding control units. 

The steering angle is also sent via the PT-CAN (e.g. direction indicator reset). All diagno¬ 
sis and programming functions are performed via this data link. 


SZL PowerSupply 

The SZL is connected to terminal 30. Only the steering angle sensor, the direction indi¬ 
cator steering column stalk and the switch for steering column adjustment are monitored 
every 300 ms in sleep mode. The closed circuit current is approx. 1 mA.

E6x 9/05 Model Updates 











Steering Angle Sensor 

The steering angle sensor is designed as a contactless, optical angle measuring system. 

The system consists of a code disc and an optical sensor. The code disc is connected 
via a drive element directly to the steering wheel. The code disc turns within the optical 
sensor when the steering wheel is moved. 


Steering Column Switches 

As on the E65/E60, the steering column switches are 
designed as electrical switches, which include switching 
mats and microswitches. 

Differing from the predecessor models, the connectors 
to the SZL control unit have been modified. 



Coil Spring Assembly 

The coil spring assembly can be replaced only as a com¬ 
plete unit.The task ofthe coil spring is to transmit the fol¬ 
lowing electrical signals from and to the multifunction 
steering wheel: 

• Activation of driver airbag 

• SM G control buttons 

• M ultifunction buttons 

• Horn and steering wheel heating 



Locking 

To avoid damaging the coil spring assembly, it must be set to the correct position when 
dismantling the steering wheel and coil spring assembly. 


The front wheels and steering wheel must be setto the straight-ahead position as the 
prerequisite for disassembly. During disassembly ofthe steering wheel, the load on the 
lock pin ofthe coil spring assembly is relieved and the pin can lock in the straight ahead 
position. 


When the steering wheel is reinstalled, this arrangement ensures that the coil spring is 
not damaged when the steering wheel is turned to full left and right lock.

Functions 


The functions of the steering column switch cluster are: 

• Detecting steering angle and steering speed 

• Detecting the controls in the multifunction steering wheel (volume, mDrive, etc.) 

• Detecting switching signals from the steering column switches 

• Sending and receiving information to/from the interlinked control units 

• Activating steering wheel heating 

• Reading switch for steering column adjustment 

• Reading buttons, SMG paddles 

• Reading horn button and activating horns. 

Detecting Steering Angle 

The steering column switch cluster must detect the steering angle and steering speed 
information as the basis for calculating various functions in the DSC. 

Further information such as the absolute steering angle orthe steering wheel rotation 
information is calculated. A steering angle of - 1807+180° is detected. 

An LED and fibre optics unit illuminate the code disc from above. Due to the pattern on 
the code disc, the light from above reaches the bottom only in certain areas where the 
light beams hit the line camera. This process is similarto scanning barcodes on pack- 
ages/goods purchased. 

The line camera converts the line signals into electrical signals and transfers them to the 
SZL.

E6x 9/05 Model Updates 




Section of Code Disc 



The code disc rotates dependent on the 
steering wheel angle setting.The pattern on 
the code disc changes in steps of 2°. 


Optical Sensor 





The light beams hit the line camera. The light pulses 
are converted to electrical pulses in the line sensor. 




The pattern on the code disc changes as the The position of the light beams is displaced. The line 

disc continues to turn. The light passes through camera detects the light beams in other areas and 

the code disc into other areas. transfers the information to the SZL. 

Relative Steering Angle 

The relative steering angle indicates the angle position of the steering wheel. The infor¬ 
mation relating to the relative steering angle is always retained even when powerto the 
control unit is disconnected. Renewed zero adjustment is necessary only afterthe steer¬ 
ing column switch cluster SZL has been replaced. 



56 

E6x 9/05 Model Updates 






























Absolute Steering Angle 

The absolute steering angle is a calculation based on the relative steering angle and 
steering wheel rotation information.The absolute and relative steering angles are defined 
during the SZL initialization procedure. The SZL detects each position of the steering 
wheel overthe entire steering lock range. 

The precondition forthe initialization procedure is that the wheels and steering wheel are 
set in the straight-ahead position. 

Steering Wheel Rotation Information 

The steering wheel rotation information indicates the turn position of the steering wheel. 

The steering wheel rotation information is determined automatically by a virtual calcula¬ 
tion model. 

If lost, e.g. if powerto the SZL is disconnected, this information must be taught-in again. 

The steering column switch cluster SZL uses data from the speed sensors of the front 
wheels forthe calculation. The SZL assumes the vehicle is driving straight ahead at con¬ 
stant speeds and therefore detects its zero position. The minimum speed necessary for 
this purpose is 20 km/h. 

This process need not be initialized via the BMW diagnosis system. The SZL automati¬ 
cally determines the steering wheel rotation information as soon as the vehicle exceeds 
the minimum speed. 

Problems may occur in calculating the steering wheel rotation information under 
Unfavorable road conditions (icy road surfaces).The DSC sends a corresponding CC 
message in this case. 

Detecting the Controls ofthe MFL 

The voltage signals ofthe buttons on the multifunction steering wheel are routed via the 
coil spring to the steering column switch cluster SZL. The SZL evaluates the voltage sig¬ 
nals and sends the information to the corresponding control units. 

The connections ofthe driver's airbag are wired via the coil spring directly to the corre¬ 
sponding control units. This information is therefore not evaluated in the SZL.
