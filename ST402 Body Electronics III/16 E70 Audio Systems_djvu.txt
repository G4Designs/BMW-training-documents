System Overview 


E70 Audio Systems 

The HiFi system has five tweeters, five mid-range speakers and two central bass speak¬ 
ers. The HiFi amplifier has a K-CAN connection for diagnostics and coding. 

The Top-HiFi system has seven tweeters, seven mid-range speakers and two central 
bass speakers. The Top-HiFi amplifier is connected to the MOST. 

The following pages show the input/output diagrams and system circuit diagrams for the 
audio systems of the E70: 

• Amplifier and speaker systems 

• Digital tuners. 

The input/output diagram shows the subscribing control units, sensors, controls and 
components. For emphasis, only the control unit concerned is shown in its block repre¬ 
sentation. The input/ output diagram gives an overview of the system concerned, repre¬ 
sented as a signal path. It does not show whether the signals are sent via bus connec¬ 
tions, additional control units, by fixed wire or by wireless. This detailed information is 
contained in the system circuit diagram 

The input/output diagram also applies to the HiFi system, if the HiFi amplifier were 
shown in place of the Top-HiFi amplifier. 

The wheel speed signals are sent from the DSC control unit on the PT-CAN and con¬ 
verted to the K-CAN protocol in the Junction-box ECU (JB). The instrument cluster 
processes the speed signal and outputs this on the K-CAN. 

The differences between the HiFi system and the Top-HiFi system are illustrated in the 
following system circuit diagrams.

The HiFi amplifier is connected to the K-CAN for coding and diagnostics. There is no 
facility provided for programming the HiFi amplifier. 

The HiFi amplifier is woken by the Rad_On signal sent by fixed wire from the Head unit. 

The tweeters and mid-range speakers are connected in parallel. The capacitors at the 
tweeters act as duplexers and, in the case of the HiFi system, are electrolytic. 

The CHAMP receives the terminal 58g (lighting) signal by fixed wire. The CCC receives it 
via the K-CAN.

The input/output diagram also applies to the CHAMR The roof antenna receives SDARS 
signals transmitted by satellite. The signals are amplified by an amplifier integrated in the 
roof antenna and forwarded to the SDARS control module. The antenna amplifier is sup¬ 
plied with power from the SDARS control module. 

The SDARS control module decodes the digital audio signals and sends these to the 
Head unit on the MOST. The Head unit converts the audio data into analogue LF signals. 
The LF signals are output through the speakers. 

Note: That SDARS is operated using the iDrive and information such as track 
title, artist or album title are output in the CID.

System Components 


This section describes the audio systems in the E70. 

It is divided into the following chapters: 

• Head units 

• Amplifiers and speakers 

• Antennas 

• Digital tuners 

• Peripherals 

The following Audio Systems are available for the E70: 

• Professional radio 

• Professional navigation system. 

The US vehicles are eguipped with the new head unit platform called CHAMP (Central 
Head unit and Multimedia Platform) The CCC (Car Communication Computer) is avail¬ 
able as the head unit for the Professional navigation system. The head units offer eight 
favorites buttons. 

The radio and navigation system with integrated audio function can be combined with 
the following speaker and amplifier systems: 

• HiFi system 

• Top-HiFi system. 

Professional radio with HiFi system is standard eguipment in the US vehicles.The Top- 
HiFi system is available as option."SIRIUS Satellite Radio" (SDARS) is also available as

20 

E70 Audio Systems 
























When the navigation system is not in use, its DVD drive can be used to play audio CDs. 
The playback of video files is not supported. 

The CCC together with the controller and CID form the Drive system. 

The system can be used to control: 

• Communication 

• Entertainment 

• Navigation 

• Air conditioning (climate control) 

• Settings (5th menu). 

The MP3 directory structure corresponds to that of the PC. There is no limit to the num¬ 
ber of directories, subdirectories and music tracks that the CCC can support. However, 
the time taken for the drive to read the contents of the CD when the CD is inserted is 
longer, depending on how much data is stored on the CD. 


21 

E70 Audio Systems 



Amplifiers and Speakers 

The speaker systems in the E70 are, as in other Series, available in two quality levels: 

• HiFi system 

• Top-HiFi system. 

The HiFi system achieves double the power of the standard stereo system. In addition, 
the HiFi system is equipped with a 7-channel amplifier with digital equalizer. 

The optional Top-HiFi system achieves double the power of the standard HiFi system 
and uses a digital 9-channel amplifier. Optimum audio playback in the vehicle is achieved 
thanks to complex digital signal processing. 

The HiFi system has twelve speakers while the Top- HiFi system has 16 speakers each 
with different auxiliary amplifiers. 

The central bass speakers are located under the front seats. They are coupled to the side 
sills to increase the resonance volume necessary for bass reproduction. 

The Professional radio and the Professional navigation system can be combined with any 
of the amplifier/speaker systems, provided the specific national variants are taken into 
consideration. 

Note: The HiFi and Top-HiFi systems feature separate speakers for the treble 
and midrange frequencies. 

Even though the diameters of the speakers in the HiFi and Top-HiFi systems are the 
same, there are differences in the power output of the speakers. This is achieved through 
the use of different materials in the diaphragms, coils and magnets. The terms Medium 
and High are used in the table below for distinction purposes.

The essential features of the Top-HiFi amplifier are: 

• MOST control module 

• 7-channel equalizer with control by Drive 

• Higher output power in the low frequency range 

• 15V output voltage for each mid-range speaker/tweeter 

• 30 V output voltage for each central bass speaker. 

The audio signals and the control signals are sent in digital form to the Top-HiFi amplifier 
through the fiber-optic cable (MOST). Programming, coding and diagnostics are carried 
out via the MOST. 


25 

E70 Audio Systems 



















To generate surround sound information from a stereo signal, the Top-HiFi amplifier in the 
E70 supports Dolby Surround Pro Logic II. 

This method replaces the Logic7 application from other BMW vehicles. This makes it 
possible to generate a spatial sound pattern from the stereo signal that is only delivered 
by the left and right channel. 

The signals of the individual channels are output with time correction from the 16 avail¬ 
able speakers of the Top-HiFi system in the E70. This achieves an homogenous sound 
pattern for the listener in the 7.2 format. 

Audio playback can also be adjusted by the customer using the 7-channel egualizer inte¬ 
grated in the Top-HiFi amplifier. After signals have been processed, the audio signals are 
forwarded as analogue low freguency (LF) signals to the speakers. 

The Top-HiFi amplifier supports speed dependent egualization in addition to speed 
dependent volume control. The effect is that the freguency response is adjusted in rela¬ 
tion to the speed of the vehicle. 

A total of 16 speakers are controlled through nine audio channels with Top-HiFi guality: 

• one tweeter and mid-range speaker in each of the front doors 

• one tweeter and mid-range speaker in the instrument panel 

• one tweeter and mid-range speaker in each of the rear doors 

• one tweeter and mid-range speaker in each of the D-pillars 

• one central bass speaker under each of the front seats. 

Note: The Top-HiFi amplifier is located in the rear left of the luggage 
compartment behind the side panel trim. 

IKT Antennas 

The E70 has up to five antennas systems, depending on eguipment options: 

• FM/AM radio (spoiler and rear window Antennas) 

• Digital tuners (roof antenna and left side window) 

• Navigation system (roof antenna) 

• Telephone (roof antenna) additionally: 

- Bluetooth antenna under the center console for mobile phone connection 

- Emergency antenna, rear left (only in conjunction with Telematics Control UnitTCU)

Connector color code: black 


The assignment of the antenna amplifier with diversity module may differ depending on 
the vehicle equipment. The TV3 signal is not currently used. 

The antenna amplifiers for AM and FM are supplied with DC voltage from terminal 
Rad_On when the radio is switched on. The high-frequency signals of the AM, FM1 
antenna in the spoiler and of the FM2, FM3 antennas on the rear window are sent to the 
antenna amplifier with diversity module by means of a ribbon cable. 

Note: In US vehicles, the antenna amplifier also supports the frequencies of the 
weather band. Weather band is transmitted over seven channels in the 
frequency range from 162.400 MHz to 162.550 MHz. 

Note: The antenna amplifiers are in the Diversity module. There are separate 
amplifiers for AM and FM. The installation location is on the inside of 
the tailgate above the rear window.

FM Antenna Diversity 

In the E70, an FM antenna diversity is standard equipment. 

The FM antennal diversity comprises: 

• FM1, FM2 and FM3 antennas 

• FM antenna amplifier with diversity module. 

The sequence of the FM antenna diversity is defined as: 

FM1 - FM2 - FM1 - FM3. 

It then switches back to the FM1 antenna again. 

The FM1 antenna has the best reception characteristics due to its location in the rear 
spoiler. The defined sequence in which the antennas are switched ensures that the FM 
antenna with the best reception characteristics has priority over the others. 

For SW, MW and LW reception, no antenna diversity system is provided as there is only 
one AM antenna available. 

The signal quality of the currently selected FM antenna (FM1 to FM3) is evaluated in the 
diversity module. The antenna diversity module will switch to the next FM antenna if the 
signal quality of the current radio station on the active antenna deteriorates to a certain 
level in terms of quality and field strength. 

The switching takes place such manner that no interruption can be detected. The high- 
frequency signal from the active FM antenna at any particular time is fed by the antenna 
amplifier and Diversity module via a co-axial cable to the tuner in the radio or navigation 
system. The signal is then de-modulate in the tuner and output in the form of an audio 
signal through the speakers. 

The radio or navigation system detects that a diversity module is installed and generates 
the changeover voltage Us and the signal of the intermediate frequency (ZF) necessary 
for diversity operation. The ZF signal is analyzed by the electronic circuitry in the diversity 
module and is a copy of the currently selected radio station transmission on a fixed fre¬ 
quency of 10.7 MHz. 

The switch between AM reception, FM diversity operation and diagnostics mode occurs 
in response to changeover voltage Us. 

This is generated by the radio and analyzed in the diversity module. Diversity operation is 
active when Us= 2.5 V. AM mode is active, or the FM1 antenna is selected, when Us = 
0 V. Diagnostics mode is active when Ds = 5 V.

In total, up to three signals are therefore applied on the coaxial cable simultaneously. 

• HF signal (e.g. 87.5 - 108 MHz) from the diversity module to the radio 

• Control DC voltage Us from the radio to the diversity module 

• Intermediate frequency (fZF = 10.7 MHz) from the radio to the diversity 
module as the basis for evaluating the quality of the HF signal. 

Note: Mutual influencing is not possible due to the different frequencies.

SDARS enables you to receive digital radio signals and therefore enhances AM and FM 
reception. Digital transmissions are superior in quality to analogue transmissions. The 
satellite radio stations can be selected using the additional "SAT" menu item in the Drive.

Advantages of digital satellite radio: 

• Reception of same radio station across the entire US mainland (excluding Alaska) 

• Digital reception of music, news and talk stations 

• Wide choice of available music 

• No commercial breaks 

• Digital signal transmission provides greater immunity to external interference. 

The SDARS system developed by Sirius Satellite Radio is supported. This uses three 
satellites which follow an elliptical orbit around the Earth. Because of the arrangement of 
the orbits, there are always two satellites over the reception area. In areas without cover¬ 
age, the SDARS signals are beamed terrestrially. Both SDARS signals (satellite and ter¬ 
restrial) are received by an antenna patch in the roof antenna and made available to the 
SDARS control module. To make use of the signal, the feature must be enabled by the 
service provider Sirius. 

Note: The separate satellite tuner is necessary because the signals are trans¬ 
mitted in the gigahertz band (microwave band).The satellite tuner is 
located in the luggage compartment on the left-hand side.

Single-slot CD changer means that the CDs are loaded individually into the device with¬ 
out a magazine. A CD can be loaded by pressing the load button, followed by the button 
for the operating tray of the CD to be inserted. If no button is pressed after the load but¬ 
ton has been tapped, the LED in the operating tray button assigned to the first free tray 
flashes. In the meantime, the tray moves into position. 

When the tray is in the correct position, the status display begins to flash and the CD can 
be loaded. The contents of the CD are read as soon as the CD is inserted. The next CD 
cannot be inserted until the contents of this CD have been read. The rapid loading fea¬ 
ture must be activated to be able to insert all CDs immediately one after the other. To do 
this, the load button must be pressed for approximately 2 seconds. The LEDs in the 
operating buttons assigned to free trays begin to flash. Up to 6 CDs can be inserted one 
after the other, depending on the number of trays free. The contents of the CDs inserted 
are read either once the final free tray has been filled, on expiry of a time out or if the load 
or eject button is pressed. An individual CD can be ejected by pressing the eject button 
followed by the operating button concerned. Pressing and holding the eject button ejects 
all the CDs. 

The CDs cannot be loaded unless the shutter is open. The status display flashes when it 
is possible to insert a disc. Operation is described in detail in the Owner's Handbook for 
the vehicle.

Single-slot CD Changer Installation Location 



The CD changer supports the following compressed file formats: 

• MPEG-1 Layer 3 Audio (MP3) with ID3 tag version 1 and version 2 

• Windows Media Audio (WMA) with WMA tags 

• Advanced Audio Coding (AAC). 

These files are decoded in the CD changer. The CD changer is accessible when the 
glove compartment is open. The following graphic shows how the CD changer is con¬ 
nected to the cross-member. 

The data on the CD is decoded by the CD changer and converted into the digital MOST 
format. 

If the vehicle is eguipped with the stereo or HiFi speaker system, the digital data on the 
CD is sent to the head unit via the MOST. Here they are converted to analogue data and 
output via the amplifier and the speakers. 

If the Top-HiFi system is installed, the decoded audio data is sent directly to the Top- HiFi 
amplifier via the MOST from where it is output. This direct transmission bypassing the 
head unit is made possible because data conversion and sound adjustment take place 
exclusively in the Top-HiFi amplifier.

Retrofitting a CD Changer 

The fiber optics conductors for connecting the CD changer are arranged at the fiber 
optics connector in the luggage compartment such that they are not incorporated in the 
MOST ring. After retrofitting a CD changer, the fiber optics conductors for the CD chang¬ 
er preparation are unplugged at the fiber optics connector and connected to the MOST 
ring. It is then necessary to code the entire vehicle. 

Audio Jack 

The audio jack is used to connect an external audio source such as MP3, cassette or CD 
playback devices. The audio jack (Aux In) is standard equipment in the E70. It is located 
below the center armrest. A 12-V socket outlet is located in the immediate vicinity of the 
audio jack.

Service Information 

Diagnosis 

It is possible to run diagnostics on the HiFi amplifier thanks to its connection to the K- 
CAN. The following measures have been implemented to minimize interference during 
AM and also FM reception: 

• Tailgate hinges with integrated ground straps 

• Low-noise AM and FM antenna amplifiers 

• ground connection on both silencers 

• Shielded Wave barrier. 


An audio test CD is available from the EPC that can be used to test drives. 

The BMW diagnostic system contains the control module entries listed in the table:

Reset 

All head units can be reset by following the procedure described below: 

• Switch system ON/OFF 

• BMW diagnostic system 

• Disconnect from vehicle electrical system. 

There is no specific button or button stroke combination on the CHAMP for performing a 
reset. 

The CCC can be reset by simultaneously pressing and holding the eject buttons on the 
DVD and CD player and the rotary push button for approximately 10 seconds. The CID 
becomes blank. The CCC is then restarted. 

Note: The MOST gateway (CHAMP, CCC) is muted for 2 seconds when a 
MOST control module is reset. 

Service Concept 

The CHAMP is replaced as complete units. 

The service concept of the CCC permits replacement of individual assemblies. 

The following assemblies can be replaced: 

• Fan 

• CD and DVD player 

• Front panel 

• HIP 

• Yaw rate sensor. 

Note: Observe the ESD guidelines in case of replacement. The CCC must not 
be stood on its rear panel as the sockets may be damaged by the weight 
of the unit. 

In diagnostics, the following diagnostic gueries can be issued for the amplifiers available: 

HiFi Amplifier 

• Responds to diagnostics thanks to K-CAN connection 

• Separate control of individual audio channels

E70 Audio Systems 



Top-HiFi Amplifier 

• Output of sinus tones by means of an internal sine-wave generator (configurable 
parameters: freguency, volume, speaker channel) 

• Separate control of individual audio channels 

Antenna Diagnosis 

Antenna diagnostics on the E70 proceeds in the same way as diagnostics on the BMW 3 
Series (E90, E91, E92), BMW 5 Series (E60, E61) and BMW 6 Series (E63, E64): 

The self-diagnosis procedure for the diversity module is initiated in the diagnosis module 
of the BMW diagnosis system. The self-diagnosis comprises a check of the antenna 
inputs based on a DC measurement. 

If the check proves positive, each individual FM antenna is switched on one after the 
other in a specified seguence and the signal guality evaluated (antenna scan). The AM 
reception can be evaluated in the LW, SW and MW range with the AM amplifier switched 
on and off. The diagnosis system evaluates the measurements and deduces the status 
when the self-diagnosis of the diversity module provides a positive result. 

This procedure can also be carried out manually by switching the CHAMP into service 
mode: 

The signal guality and field strength of the station currently tuned in can be displayed in 
service mode. 

Service Mode 

Service Mode is Accessed as Follows: 

• Open Start menu 

• Press and hold the controller for at least 10 seconds 

• Move the controller 3 stops to the right 

• Move the controller 3 stops to the left 

• Move the controller 1 stop to the right 

• Move the controller 1 stop to the left 

• Move the controller 1 stop to the right 

• Press the controller once. 

Note: To exit Service mode press the Menu button.

E70 Audio Systems 




Note: Low values with regard to signal quality and field strength may indicate 
to damaged antennas or the absence of terminal Rad_On. 

Terminal Rad_On supplies power to the antenna amplifier and the diversity module. 

Hissing or Interference on Radio 

Check the following in the event of hissing or interference with radio reception: 

• Station tuning 

• Mechanical damage to the antenna structure 

• Power supply terminal Rad_On for the antenna amplifiers in the diversity module. 

• Antenna connector at diversity module 

• Diversity module connected to ground by securing screws 

• Antenna connector on radio or navigation system. 

The following measures have been taken in the E70 to minimize reception interference 
of AM and FM stations: 

• Tailgate connected to ground by the tailgate hinges with integrated ground straps 

• Low-noise AM and FM antenna amplifiers with direct ground connection 

• Ground connection on the left and right silencer 

• Shielded Wave barrier. 

The ground connection on the two silencers helps to suppress interference transmitted 
from the engine compartment (ignition electronics) along the exhaust system. 

The exhaust system is a wave guide and, if no ground straps are used, it carries high-fre¬ 
quency interference to the rear end of the vehicle. At the end of the exhaust system, the 
interference is radiated out and couples into the antenna structures located at the rear of 
the vehicle. The ground straps on the silencers connect the interference to ground, there¬ 
by suppressing the interference. These ground connections have already been fitted to 
the BMWX5 (E53). 

The shielded wave barrier connects to ground the 
screen of the coaxial line between the head unit 
and antenna diversity on the D-pillar. Interference 
transmitted by the screen is therefore conducted 
away to ground.

CD Changer 

If the eject button is no longer working, a CD can be ejected using the diagnostic tester. If 
the CD is mechanically jammed in the drive, it is necessary to send in the CD changer. 

When the MOST bus enters sleep mode, the contents of the CD that has been inserted 
and read is stored inside the head unit. There is therefore no need for this data to be read 
once more when the MOST boots up again. The data is not saved in the event of a low 
voltage situation before the MOST has entered sleep mode or a voltage interruption with 
the MOST active. For this reason, the contents of the inserted CDs have to be read once 
more when the MOST boots up.
