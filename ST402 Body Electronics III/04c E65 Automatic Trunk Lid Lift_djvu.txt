E65 Trunk Lid Lift 



Introduction 

The Automatic Trunk Lid Lift (HKL) is equipped on E65s ordered with the optional con¬ 
venience package. It controls automatic opening and closing of the trunk lid using a 
hydraulic pump and piston. The HKL control unit operates closely in conjunction with 
the Power Module and the CAS. 

Operation of the automatic trunk lid lift is only active while the vehicle is stationary.

Components 

The HKL system consists of the following components: 

• HKL control unit 

• Hydraulic assembly (Pump, pressure valve, lines and piston) 

• Trunk lid angle sensor 

• Trunk lid button S237 TOEHKK (inside the trunk lid) 

The components and principle of operation of the trunk locking system remain 
unchanged from a conventional trunk . 

HKL Control Unit 

The HKL control unit controls the automatic opening and closing of the trunk lid. 

It operates in conjunction with the CAS and the PM (Power Module) and is networked in 
the K-CAN P-Bus. 

The HKL is located in the right rear corner of the luggage compartment. 



The Power Module controls the operation of the trunk lid lock and the soft close assem¬ 
bly as well as signalling (over the K-CAN P) the reguests for opening and closing the 
trunk from the external trunk button. 

The CAS provides the HKL with the reguest for opening the trunk from the Remote 
Control system as well as the passenger compartment trunk button.

Hydraulic Assembly 

The hydraulic pump (radial piston) of the trunk lid lift is driven by an electric motor 
which operates in two directions of travel. 

The pump is located near the mount for the right rear strut. 



It is controlled via a PWM signal from the HKL control unit. The signal is varied depend¬ 
ing on the opening angle of the trunk lid to maintain an even closing speed over the 
entire range. 

An electro-mechanical hydraulic pressure valve is integrated into the hydraulic pump. 
The pressure valve is controlled by a PWM signal from the HKL control unit. The valve 
is normally open. 


The hydraulic pressure increases as the valve is 
powered closed. The hydraulic pressure, controlled 
by the PWM signal affects the trunk lid opening/clos¬ 
ing force. 

The maximum pressure produced by the hydraulic 
assembly is 10Obar. 

The hydraulic piston is attached to the left side trunk 
hinge. 

There is no initialization necessary when exchanging 
hydraulic components. 

The trunk should be operated several times to 
displace any air that may be in the system.

Trunk Lid Angle Sensor 

To detect the position, opening angle and speed of the trunk lid, an angle Hall sensor 
similar to those used on the E46 convertible is used. A voltage value is output depending 
on the opening angle of the trunk lid. 


The angle sensor is attached to the right side trunk hinge. 



The lid opening angle is divided into 9 segments. 


These segments are used to determine the reguired system pressure to maintain 
a steady opening/closing speed. 


Trunk Lid Button S237 (inside of the trunk lid) 

This button can only be accessed after the trunk lid is opened. It is a primarily used to 
signal the HKL to close the trunk, however it can signal both an open or close reguest. 

Input to the HKL control unit from this switch is a momentary ground signal. The ground 
is provided by the position contact inside of the trunk lock actuator (ZV) only when the 
trunk is “open”. 

An illuminated switch indicates that there is a ground available.

Principle of Operation 


Sequence of Opening Operation 

When the "Open" request is sent by radio-control key or by a trunk button 
(TOEHK S117orTOEHKI S8), the PM operates the trunk lid lock actuator (ZV). 

The operating command is transferred by the K-CAN P to the HKL which activates the 
pump in the "Open" direction. The pressure valve is still not activated, so the pressure in 
the hydraulic system is minimal. When the trunk lid lock is fully open, the contact inside of 
the ZV signals the PM. 

This information is also transferred by bus to the HKL. Simultaneously as the SCA motor 
is being operated by the PM the HKL activates the opening operation. The pressure 
valve is closed and pressure is built up. The lid is now opened fully. 

The HKL module detects the position of the trunk lid using the angle sensor. 



Shortly before reaching the end stop "lid open" (transition from segment 7 to segment 8), 
trunk speed is reduced and the lid slowly moves to its end position. 

If one of the control buttons is pressed again during the opening sequence, the operation 
is interrupted. Pressing the button once more resumes the sequence. 

Operation of the automatic trunk lift is not allowed if the outside temperature 
(K-CAN P signal originated by the Kombi) is below -30°C (-22°F).

Sequence of Closing Operation 

When the "Close" command is sent by pressing the control button (TOEHK S117 or 
TOEHKKS237 ), the HKL activates the closing operation. 

The pump motor is activated in the "closing" direction by reversing polarity in the HKL 
control unit. Shortly before the trunk lid reaches the closed position, the speed of the lid 
is reduced to provide a smooth run-down into the lock assembly. 

Once the contact switch in the trunk lock ZV opens, the SCA runs to bring in the trunk lid 
to the final closed position. 

Anti-Trap 

The trunk lid speed is reported to the HKL control unit by the angle sensor. The speed is 
compared with the time curve stored in the module. If this speed is slower then the 
stored value the trunk lid is stopped. 

Timed Arrest 

An timed arrest function prevents the pump motor from overheating: 

• If the pump is in continuous operation for 2 minutes it is shut-off for 6 minutes to 
allow it to cool. 

• The pump cannot be operated before the 6 minutes have elapsed. 

Emergency Mode 

If the automatic control malfunctions, the trunk lid can be opened and closed in the same 
way as a conventional, manually operated lid, i.e. without the need for additional mea¬ 
sures. 

Slightly more effort is reguired to open the trunk than for a gas-spring assisted lid. 

After manually opening the trunk lid, it should be opened and closed twice hydraulically. 
This process vents the hydraulic system again.

- j j i Classroom Exercise - Review Questions 

1. How does the HKL control unit control the speed of the trunk lid to provide a 
smooth rundown at the end positions (Fully open/closed)? 


2. At what outside temperature is the HKL no longer operational? Where does this 
signal come from?
