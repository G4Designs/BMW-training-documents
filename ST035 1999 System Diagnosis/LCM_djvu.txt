LIGHT CHECK MODULE III (LCM III) 

OVERVIEW 

The light check module LCM has been redesigned for Model 
Year 99 as of 9/98 production. It is now identified as the LCM 
III and is installed in both the E38 and E39 vehicles. 

The module itself has been redesigned with new semi-conductor final stages that produce 
less heat in operation. This has allowed forthe elimination of the protruding heat sink found 
on the previous LCM . 

The total scope of function and features has been expanded to improve the comfort and 
safety forthe driver and passengers of the vehicle. Feature and functional changes to the 
LCM include: 

Replacement lighting forthe parking lights 
Limiting of output voltage to the lamps 
Follow Me Home (delayed exit) lighting 

REPLACEMENT LIGHTING 

The LCM can use substitute bulbs for various lights if a failure should occur, for example: 

Front Parking Lights: If one of the parking lamps should fail, the LCM will illuminate the 
turn signal bulb on the affected side. The lamp will be dimmed by the LCM so that the inten¬ 
sity is the same as the parking lamp. 

Rear Taillights: If one of the rear taillights should fail, the LCM will switch on the brake 
lamp on the affected side. The lamp will be dimmed to the intensity of the tail lamp. 

OUTPUT VOLTAGE LIMITING FUNCTION 

The output voltage applied to the parking and tail lamps is regulated to increase the life of 
the lamps. If the voltage at the LCM increases over 12,5 volts, the LCM will reduce the volt¬ 
age to 12 volts. 

FOLLOW ME HOME LIGHTING 

This convenience feature provides lighting forthe driver and passengers to leave the vehi¬ 
cle and enter their homes. 

The feature is switched "ON" by pulling the headlight flasherswitch afterthe headlights and 
ignition have been switched OFF. The feature is switched OFF after a coded time delay or 
by switching the ignition ON.
