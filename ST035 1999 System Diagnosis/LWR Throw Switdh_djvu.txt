LWR - HEADLIGHT BEAM THROW CONTROL 

OVERVIEW 

LWR automatically adjusts the vertical positioning of the headlights to maintain optimum 
headlight beam positioning for maximum driving visibility and to prevent undue glare for 
oncoming motorists. The system compensates for vehicle load angle changes (ie: dimin¬ 
ishing reserve of gasoline in fuel tank during a long journey, overloaded cargo weight, etc.) 

LWR has been available on BMW vehicles in other markets for quite some time. Starting 
with the 1999 model year all US market vehicles with Xenon Lights incorporate LWR as 
standard equipment. LWR is not available with standard halogen headlights. 

LWR monitors the vehicle’s loaded angle via two hall effect sensors mounted to the front 
and rear suspension members. When an adjustment is necessary, LWR simultaneously 
activates two stepper motors (one in each headlight assembly). 

The stepper motors drive a threaded rod that moves the lower edge of the headlight carri¬ 
er plate forward and backward (depending on driven direction). The upper edge of the 
headlight carrier plate is fixed on a pivot. The pivoting movement adjusts the vertical posi¬ 
tion of the headlight beam.

LWR COMPONENTS 

CONTROL ELECTRONICS 

LWR Control Module - E38 & E39 Vehicles: 


The LWR control module is located in the electronics carrier forward of the glovebox. The 
control module connects to a single, 26 pin, yellow harness connector. The control mod¬ 
ule has diagnostic capabilities and communicates with the DIS/MoDiC via the K bus - IKE 
gateway to the D bus.

LSZ - E46 

The E46 LWR function is integrated into the control electronics of the LSZ. The LSZ mon¬ 
itors the reguired input signals to provide the LWR function and directly activates the step¬ 
per motors in the headlight assemblies. All LWR diagnosis is accessed through the LSZ 
control module. 


LEVEL SENSORS 

LWR monitors two hall effect level sensors to 
determine vehicle load angle. The sensors 
are mounted to a fixed point on the suspen¬ 
sion carriers of the front and rear axles. 

A lever is connected to the moving suspen¬ 
sion memberwhich changes the sensors out¬ 
put linear voltage signal as the suspension 
moves up and down. 



Note: E39 sport wagon vehicles with EHC have a dual output sensor at the right rear loca¬ 
tion. This sensor shares the same housing as the EHC systems right rear level sensor.

HEADLIGHT ADj USTMENT STEPPER MOTORS 


One stepper motor is located inside each 
headlight assembly. 

The 4 wire stepper motors are controlled 
by the LWR control electronics to change 
the vertical headlight position. 



FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION 


The E46 LWR system comes on-line when the ignition switch is turned to KL 15. The 
E38/E39 system comes on-line when the lights are switched on. 

The LWR control electronics then cycles the stepper motors through their full range of 
motion and stops at a default position. 

The control electronics monitors the level sensor input signals to determine the vehicles 
load angle and adjusts the beam position accordingly. As the vehicle is driven it continual¬ 
ly monitors the level sensor signals and if necessary updates the headlight beam positions 
even/ 25 seconds on the E46 or momentarily on the E38/E39 system. 

Abrupt fluctuations of the sensor signals are filtered to prevent unnecessary adjustment as 
well as monitoring road speed and brake pedal application as correction factors. 

HEADLIGHT ALIGNMENT 

The procedure for aligning Xenon Headlights with LWR is the same as conventional halo¬ 
gen bulb systems with one additional step. Wait at least 30 seconds forthe LWR to cycle 
and adjust to it’s calculated position. 

LWR DIAGNOSIS 

The LWR control module of the E38/E39 is diagnosible using the DIS/M oDiC. The head¬ 
lights must be switched on in order to start diagnosis. 

The E46 L5Z incorporates LWR diagnosis program.
