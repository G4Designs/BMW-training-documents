M73 TU & M62 TU COOLING SYSTEMS 

OVERVIEW 

The cooling systems have been changed for the 1999 model year vehicles. The new com¬ 
ponents consist of a new radiator, coolant expansion tank, transmission fluid heat exchang¬ 
er, DME controlled coolant thermostat and auxiliary fan.

RADIATOR 


The new radiator has a 
two section cross-flow 
design. 

The main coolant flow is in 
the upper 4/5 section 
where the hot engine 
coolant temperature is 
reduced and cycled 
through the system. 

The lower 1/5 section is a 
low temperature residual 
coolant storage area for 
the heating and cooling 
concept (MTK) first intro¬ 
duced on the E46. 

The low temperature 
coolant is made available 
to the oil and water heat 
exchanger on the lower 
left side of the radiator.

TRANSMISSION FLUID HEAT EXCHANGER 


The transmission fluid/engine coolant heat 
exchanger concept introduced with the 
M52 TU is now also used on all E38 and 
E39 vehicles with automatic transmissions. 

This system provides a faster warm up of 
the automatic transmission fluid by heating 
the fluid through the heat exchanger reduc¬ 
ing frictional drag in the transmission faster 
after cold start. The addition of this compo¬ 
nent helps to reduce fuel consumption. 



On cold engine start-up, the engine's coolant is heated quicker than the automatic trans 
mission fluid. 


When the automatic transmission fluid is cold, coolant is guided from the engine (water 
cooled generator housing) to the heat exchanger. Coolant flow through the heat exchang¬ 
er is regulated by an integral thermostatically controlled valve. The warm engine coolant 
heats the transmission fluid through the exchange of heat (illustration depicts transmission 
fluid warm up).

As the transmission fluid rises to operating temperature the engine coolant temperature 
also rises which causes the wax core in the integral thermostat to expand and push the 
regulation valve against spring pressure. This closes the warm coolant port and opens the 
low temperature coolant port from the residual storage area of the radiator. The tempera¬ 
ture change of coolant flow through the heat exchanger continually regulates the tempera¬ 
ture of the transmission fluid.
