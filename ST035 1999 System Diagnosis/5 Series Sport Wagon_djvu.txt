5 Series sport wagon 


INTRODUCTION 

The 5 Series sport wagon is being introduced in the US market for M odel Year 1999 (9/98 
SOP). It shares many components with it's E39 sedan counterpart and is identical from the 
"B" pillar forward. 

US market 5 Series sport wagons are available in two variants: 

528i sport wagon; powered by the recently introduced 2.8 liter M 52 TU engine, 

540i sport wagon; powered by the new 4.4 liter M 62 TU engine. 

Transmission availability includes: 

528i - Standard: 5-speed manual (S5D 310Z), Optional 4-speed automatic (A4S 270R). 
540i - Standard 5-speed automatic (A5S 440Z - Steptronic), Optional None 

The E39 sport wagon tailgate is larger than it's predecessors (E34 touring) with a lower sill 
for easier cargo loading. 

The wheelbase of the sport wagon is the same as the sedan, however the body is 30mm 
longer and 10mm higher. 

The design of the sport wagon rear suspension system is new. The system eliminates the 
upper rear spring strut mounting found on the E39 sedan models which increases the load 
space in the cargo area. The entire loading area of the sport wagon is a uniform width. 

The rear suspension is also configured with a self-leveling air spring suspension system 
(EHC) which is optional on the 528i sport wagon and standard on the 540i sport wagon.

The rear side access panels drop to reveal the radio amplifier and CD changer on the left 
side and the sound system subwoofer on the right side. The subwoofer has a hold down 
knob and is mounted on a hinge. It can be swung out to access the battery and fuse panel 
by unscrewing the knob. di 



















































































































































TAILGATE 


The tailgate opens to an angle of 88° 
measured from the "D" pillar and to a 
height of 2029mm measured from the 
ground to the upper edge of the raised 
tailgate. 

The rear window is bonded to a load 
bearing frame and can be opened sep¬ 
arately from the main tailgate. This 
improves the overall rigidity of the tail¬ 
gate assembly. 

The tailgate gas springs are recessed 
into cavities in the roof. Special tools 
are reguired for removal. Refer to E39 
sport wagon special tools on page 96. 



TAILGATE LOCK SYSTEM 


The tailgate lock assembly is a combination of Soft Close Automatic (SCA) of the E38 
and the tailgate lock mechanism from the E34. 

The electrical operation of the SCA is the same as on the E38 and is a function of the 
central body electronics. 

A mechanical tailgate lock cylinder is not used on the sport wagon. The door is opened 
by the unlock pad above the license plate, the remote tailgate switch located in the dri¬ 
vers kick panel or via FZV control. 


EMERGENCY RELEASE 


An emergency release mechanism is however incorpo¬ 
rated into the latch assembly to open the hatch from the 
vehicle interior if malfunctions occur. 

To access the emergency release, drop both side storage 
covers in the cargo area. Turn the tool kit release levers 
90° to unlock tool kit from tailgate. Lift tool kit up and find 
the plastic tab on the passenger side. 

Pull the tab from the tailgate and pull the connected plas¬ 
tic cable outward to the passenger side of the vehicle.

REAR WINDOW WIPER/WASHER 


The rear wiper system on the E39 Sport Wagon is a self-contained unit. The control elec¬ 
tronics are integrated into the gear drive that is part of the motor assembly. 


The control electronics contain two hall sensors, 
one for the park position and one for the end stop, 
or to signal reverse direction of the wiper motor.

The wiper arm drive shaft bearing, drive shaft and wiper arm are mounted to the rear glass, 
while the motor, control module and gear drive are mounted to the tailgate. 



Rear Window/Wiper Service Notes: 


When replacing a rear win¬ 
dow make sure the wiper 
base mounting nut is tight¬ 
ened to specification shortly 
after the window is placed 
on the rear window frame. 

This will secure the glass at 
the base of the window 
frame ensuring a good seal 
before the bonding adhesive 
dries. 

The wiper arm and drive 
shaft are connected by 
splines. Special tool 61 1 
320 is required to hold the 
drive shaft in park position 
prior to installing the wiper 
arm on to the drive shaft.

REAR WIPER/WASHER OPERATION 

The rear wiper is operator controlled through the 
stalk switch on the steering column. The switch 
includes the following added functions: 

Intermittent rear window wiping 
Programmed rear window wiping interval 
Operation of the rear window washer 

Additionally, the system automatically controls the 
following safety and convenience features. 

Wiper interrupt with the rear glass opened 
Wiping interrupt with a blocked wiper arm 
Continuous wiping when the vehicle is shifted into reverse. 

Pressing the wiper stalk forward to the first detent activates the rear wiper in the intermit¬ 
tent mode. The timed interval is approx. 7 seconds. The full sweep and park positions are 
recognized by the two hall sensors on the motor gear assembly. If the wiper is switched 
OFF, the wiper blade will return to the park position. 

If the transmission is shifted into reverse, the wiper will switch to continuous operation until 
the vehicle is shifted out of reverse. 

The programmed wiper interval procedure is as follows: 

Briefly switch the rear wiper ON/OFF 
Wait the desired interval time 
Switch the rear wiper ON again 

The OFF time will be the programmed interval - up to approx. 30 seconds 

Rear window washing is activated by pressing the wiper stalk switch to the full forward 
position. The washer pump operates followed by two full wiping cycles. The wipers will then 
switch to the intermittent wiping mode.

REAR SUSPENSION SYSTEMS 


The standard rear suspension of the 528i sport wagon follows the design characteristics of 
the four link elasto kinematic system of the E38/E39 sedan vehicles. 



The main design difference is the separation of the coil springs and dampers. 


The coil springs are positioned between the perches of the wheel carriers and the under¬ 
side of the rear floor pan. 

The shock absorbers are positioned diagonally between the lower lateral control arm 
and the rear axle sub frame. 

This configuration provides the wide, uniform load space in the cargo area. 

Since the shock absorbers are now mounted directly to the sub 
frame, the sport wagon requires unique sub frame hydro mounts. 

The hydro mounts contain a fluid that helps to suppress road/sus¬ 
pension noise and vibrations from transmitting into the vehicle 
body. 

The hydro mounts require new special tools for removal and 
replacement. See E39 sport wagon special tools section on page 
96.

ELECTRONIC HEIGHT CONTROL (EHC)AIR SUSPENSION SYSTEM 

OVERVIEW 


The self-leveling air suspension system is being introduced on US market E39 sport wagon 
vehicles. The system is standard on the 540i and optional on the 528i sport wagons. 



The mechanical design is identical to the standard 528i rear suspension however the coil 
springs are replaced by aircushion springs. The air pressure in the airsprings is managed by 
the EHC system which automatically controls the ride height under all operating conditions. 


91 















OVERVIEW OF EHC CONTROL SYSTEM 


The control philosophy of EHC is to "Initiate a control sequence only when necessary". The 
system offers the following advantages: 

The control system operates independently from the vehicle's engine (no engine driven 
hydraulic pump system as per previous self leveling systems). 

Individual control of the rear wheels is possible 

An uneven load is identified and compensated for 

Uneven road surfaces are identified and not compensated for 

Automatic control is interrupted when cornering 

The system is diagnosable using the DIS or MoDiC 

The air suspension system consists of the following components:

EHC SYSTEM COMPONENTS 


CONTROL MODULE 


The Control Module is mounted in the module carrier box in the luggage compartment on 
the right side. It contains the processing electronics and final stages for operation of the 
EHC system. 


The control module receives the following 
inputs fonts processing functions: 


KL 30 & 31 (Power/Ground) 


KL 15 


Left & Right Ride Height Sensors 

K Bus for; 

- Vehicle speed 

- Engine running 

- Door/tailgate - open/closed 



The control module incorporates two filters (slow/rapid) for processing the input signals 
from the ride height sensors. Depending on the operating mode, eitherthe slow or rapid fil¬ 
ter is used to check the need for a regulating sequence. 




The slow filter is used during the normal operation mode to prevent normal suspension trav¬ 
el from causing the system to make adjustments. 


The rapid filter is used during the pre-run and tailgate (LID) modes to ensure that the sus¬ 
pension is adjusted quickly while the vehicle is being loaded or checked prior to operation. 


93 



































































AIR SPRINGS 


The air spring is made from a flexible rubber material. It 
forms an air tight cavity which provides the calculated 
spring rate required for the sport wagon. 

As the spring compresses downward the bottom edge of 
the rubber material rolls along the vertical surface of the 
base mount cylinder. 

Air is added or removed from the air spring through its top 
port. The top port of each spring is connected to a reser¬ 
voir and the air supply pipes. The reservoirs are required 
to hold additional air due to the compact design of the 
springs. 

REAR AXLE LEVEL SENSORS 



Hall effect sensors are mounted on the left 
and right sides of the rear suspension for 
ride height detection. They are pivoted by a 
coupling rod through the rear axle swing 
arms. 

The hall sensors produce a varying voltage 
input to the control module as the suspen¬ 
sion height changes. 

If the vehicle is equipped with Xenon head¬ 
lights the right side sensor contains an 
additional sensor for the automatic head¬ 
light level adjustment system. 



WARNING DISPLAYS 


If the system is faulted and off-line or set in the transport mode, the following is displayed 


Basic Cluster: A warning lamp indicator is illuminated used on the 

basic cluster. 



High Cluster: A message is posted in the high cluster matrix display. 























































AIR SUPPLY SYSTEM (LVA) 


The air supply system is identified as the LVA in the diagnosis program and in the repair 
manual. It is mounted in the spare tire well compartment. The components are housed in 
a sound deadening carrier, through rubber bushings, to prevent operating noises from 
being transmitted through the vehicle's interior. 

With the exception of the compressor relay, individual replacement parts for the air supply 
system are not available. If diagnosis determines a defect in any of the other air system 
components, complete replacement is necessary. 


The air supply system consists of the following components: 



Compressor assembly with; 

- Piston compressor 

- Electric motor 

- Air dryer (desiccator) 

- Pressure relief solenoid valve 

- Pressure maintenance valve 

- Check valves 

Compressor Relay (Replaceable) 

Solenoid Valve Block (2 - two way 
valves) 

Lines - including distributor block 



95 






















































































































































































AIR SUPPLY SYSTEM (LVA) OPERATION 

The single stage piston compressor produces a maximum pressure of 13.5 Bar. The com¬ 
pressor is maintenance free - provided it is used in a dust free environment. This includes 
the compressor's intake air filter. 

The compressor is driven by a DC motorthat is controlled by the compressor relay through 
the control module. 

When the compressor is activated, the pressure builds up to a working pressure of 11.4 
Bar (+0.8/-1.5 Bar). This is controlled through the pressure maintenance valve. The air 
under pressure is fed through the dryer and check valve to the solenoid valve block for the 
air springs. 

There is one solenoid valve in the valve block for each air strut. This allows the system to 
compensate for uneven loads in the vehicle and maintain the vehicles ride height at all 
times. 

Pressure is drained through the left or right solenoid valve (energized open) the pressure 
relief solenoid valve, restricter, check valve and dryer back to the inlet side of the compres¬ 
sor pump. 


96 























































































































































EHC SYSTEM OPERATION 


A fully functional EHC system is controlled by one of three different modes of operation. 
The operation mode is selected by the control module based on current conditions provid¬ 
ed by the monitored input signals. The main modes of operation are: 

• Pre-Run/Post-Run Mode 

• Normal Mode 

• Tailgate Mode 

Two special operating modes are also included in the control module programming. 

• New/replacement mode (pre ZCS encoded). This mode provides basic operation. 

• Transport Mode - Transport mode is set at the factory and raises the vehicle 30mm to 
prevent vehicle damage during transportation. It must be deactivated with the DIS/ 
M 0 D 1 C prior to customer delivery. 


PRE-RUN/POST-RUN MODE 

The Pre-Run mode is activated when the vehicle is parked and the control module is in the 
sleep mode. Opening a doororthe tailgate initiates a system wake up and the control mod¬ 
ule comes on-line. 

The control module performs a self-check of the control electronics and sensors. If no fault 
is found, the system will check the ride height and institute a rapid regulation if the height 
varies by more than 40mm.

3. Control module will rapidly raise the vehicle if the monitored vehicle height is lower 
than the stored value by more than 40mm. If the monitored level is not correct but 
less than 40mm the control module will adjust the vehicle level once the engine is 
running to prevent unnecessary battery loads. 



98 































NORMAL MODE OPERATION 


Once the rear lid is closed, KL 15 switched ON and the engine started, the system switch¬ 
es into the normal operation mode. In the normal mode, the control module will constantly 
monitor the input signals from the ride height sensors and will activate a correction if the 
ride height deviates by at least 10mm.

SPECIAL OPERATING MODES 


ASSEMBLY LINE MODE (New control module) 

The assembly line mode refers to control module manufacturing. New control modules 
are stored in a deactivated state. The control programming is not active and must first 
be ZCS encoded. 

After installing a replacement control module, it must be coded using the DIS or M oDiC. 
The instrument cluster fault display will remain illuminated until the control module is 
coded. 

TRANSPORT MODE 

The vehicle rolls off the factory assembly line with the EHC control module in the trans¬ 
port mode. The transport mode inflates the air springs to a higher position (approx. 
30mm higher) than the normal mode in order to avoid damage during transit. 

The system will not respond to any inputs that would alter the height of the vehicle. The 
fault indicator (base cluster) is illuminated or instrument cluster matrix display (high clus¬ 
ter) provides the message "Leveling System” to draw attention to the transport mode 
setting. 

The Service Functions section of the diagnosis program is used to activate/deactivate 
the transport mode. Once the transport mode is deactivated, check the vehicle Ride 
Height Offset making sure the vehicle rear axle height is to specification. 


CONTROL INTERRUPTS 

CORNERING 

To prevent unnecessary suspension adjustments while driving through corners, a "control 
interrupt" is built into the system. Above 30MPH the control module monitors the left/right 
ride height sensors for a difference of 30mm. Exceeding this difference will put the system 
into a control interrupt and no adjustment will take place. The control interrupt last for a 
duration of 5 minutes. 

VEHICLE LIFTING 

The ride height control is interrupted when the vehicle is raised on a lift or with a jack. The 
system monitors the ride height sensor inputs and when the height limit of 90 mm is 
exceeded, the control is switched OFF until the vehicle is lowered again. 


100 


EHC SERVICE INFORMATION 

DIAGNOSIS/CODING 

The EHC control module is connected to the diagnostic link. The EHC control module 
activates the fault display in the instrument cluster to alert the operator of the off-line sta¬ 
tus of the system. The EHC control module stores up to three electrical/electronic 
faults. 

Diagnosis/troubleshooting of EHC is carried out using the fault symptom troubleshoot¬ 
ing program of the M oDiC or DI5. The EHC system has an extensive diagnosis program. 

Replacement control modules are shipped in the factor/ mode. The control modules 
must be ZCS encoded using the DIS or MoDiC to activate the operating parameters.

DIS/MODIC SERVICE FUNCTIONS PROGRAM 


The Service Functions program of the DIS/MoDiC provides the Transport Mode activa¬ 
tion/deactivation and Ride Height Offset functions (see next page). 

Once the transport mode has been released, or if the system requires left to right side 
height adjustment, the ride height "OFFSET" must be carried out to ensure that the vehi¬ 
cles suspension has a base ride height level starting point. 

The "HEIGHT OFFSET" is adjusted using the DIS or MoDiC. The procedure is as follows: 


Place the vehicle on a level surface unloaded. 

Access the Height Offset program in the service function menu. 

Measure the base ride height from the lower edge of the wheel housing to the center of 
the wheel hub. 

Check measured height against the specifications listed 

Use the DIS/MoDiC to correct the ride height if the value differs from the listed specifi¬ 
cation.
