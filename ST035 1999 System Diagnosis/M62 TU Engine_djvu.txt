M62 TU VANOS 


OVERVIEW 

The variable intake valve timing system on the M62 TU continues to be identified as 
VANOS. This acronym comes from the German words; VAriable NOckenwellen Steuerung, 
which means Variable Camshaft Control. 

The M62 TU VANOS system is a new variant providing stepless VANOS functionality on 
each intake camshaft. The system is continuously variable within its range of adjustment 
providing optimized camshaft positioning for all engine operating conditions. 

While the engine is running, both 
intake camshafts are continuously 
adjusted to their optimum posi¬ 
tions. This enhances engine per¬ 
formance and reduces tailpipe 
emissions. 


Both camshafts are adjusted 
simultaneously within 20° (maxi¬ 
mum) of the camshafts rotational 
axis. 


This equates to a maximum span 
of 40° crankshaft rotation. The 
camshaft spread angles for both 
banks are as follows. 
































































































































VANOS BENEFITS 

The design of a camshaft for a non adjustable valve timing system is limited to the required 
overall performance of the engine. 

An intake camshaft with an advanced (early) profile will provide a higher performing 
power curve at a lower engine speed. But at idle speed the the advanced position will 
create a large area of intake/exhaust overlap that causes a rough, unstable idle. 

On the other hand, an intake camshaft with a retarded (late) profile will provide a very 
smooth, stable idle but will lack the cylinder filling dynamics needed for performance 
characteristics at mid range engine speeds. 

The ability to adjust the valve timing improves the engine's power dynamics and reduces 
tailpipe emissions by optimizing the camshaft angle for all ranges of engine operation. 
VANOS provides the following benefits: 

Increased torque at lower to mid range engine speeds without a loss of power in the 
upper range engine speeds. 

Increased fuel economy due to optimized valve timing angles. 

Reduction of exhaust emissions due to optimized valve overlap. 

Smoother idle quality due to optimized valve overlap.

BASIC FUNCTION OF BMW VANOS SYSTEMS 

All BMW VANOS systems are operated through electric/hydraulic/mechanical control. 


Electric Control: The engine control module is responsible for activating a VANOS sole¬ 
noid valve based on DME program mapping. The activation parameters are influenced 
by the following input signals: 


Engine speed 
Load (intake air mass) 

Engine temperature 

Camshaft position 

Oil temperature (M S 42.0 only) 


Depending on the specific VANOS system, the solenoid valve is one of two types: 

Basic black/white (on/off) solenoid valve. Found on M 50 TU and M 52 engines. 
Variable position solenoid valve. Found on the M52 TU and M62 TU engines. 


Hydraulic Control: The position of the solenoid valve directs the hydraulic flow of engine 
oil. The controlled oil flow acts on the mechanical components of VANOS system to 
position the camshaft. 


Mechanical Control: The mechanical components ofallVANOS systems operate under 
the same principle. The controlled hydraulic engine oil flow is directed through advance 
or retard activation oil ports. Each port exits into a sealed chamber on the opposite sides 
of a control piston. 

The control piston on six cylinder engine systems (M50TU, M52 & M52TU) is con¬ 
nected to a separate helical gear cup. 

The control piston on the M62TU VANOS system incorporates the helical gear. 


In its default position the oil flow is directed to the rear surface of the piston. This pulls 
the helical gear fon/vard and maintains the retarded valve timing position. 


When the oil flow is directed to the front surface of the piston, the oil pushes the helical 
gear in the opposite direction which rotates the matched helical gearing connected to the 
camshaft. 


The angled teeth of the helical gears cause the pushing movement to be converted into 
a rotational movement. The rotational movement is added to the turning of the 
camshaft providing the variable camshaft positioning.

VANOS CONTROL SOLENOID & CHECK VALVE: The VANOS solenoid is a two wire 
pulse width modulated, oil pressure control valve. The valve has four ports; 


1. Input Supply Port - Engine Oil Pressure 

2. Output Retard Port - To rear of piston/helical gear (retarded camshaft position) 

3. Output Advance Port - To front of piston/helical gear (advanced camshaft position) 

4. Vent - Released oil pressure 

A check valve is positioned forward of the solenoid in the cylinder head oil gallery. The 
check valve maintains an oil supply in the VANOS transmission and oil circuits after the 
engine is turned off. This prevents the possibility of piston movement (noise) within the 
VANOS transmission system on the next engine start. 

20 










































































VANOS TRANSMISSION: The primary and secondary timing chain sprockets are inte 
grated with the VANOS transmission. The transmission is a self-contained unit. 


The controlled adjustment of the 
camshaft occurs inside the "transmis¬ 
sion”. Similar in principle to the six 
cylinder engine VANOS systems, con¬ 
trolled oil pressure moves the piston 
axially. 

The helical gear cut of the piston acts 
on the helical gears on the inside sur¬ 
face of the transmission and rotates 
the camshaft to the specific advanced 
or retarded angle position. 

Three electrical pin contacts are locat¬ 
ed on the front surface to verify the 
default maximum retard position using 
an ohmmeter. This is required during 
assembly and adjustment, (see service 
notes further on).

OIL DISTRIBUTION FLANGES: The oil distribution flanges are bolted to the front surface 
of each cylinder head. They provide a mounting location for the VANOS solenoids as well 
as the advance-retard oil ports from the solenoids to the intake camshafts. 


CAMSHAFTS: Each intake camshaft has 
two oil ports separated by three sealing rings 
on their forward ends. 

The ports direct pressurized oil from the oil 
distribution flange to the inner workings of 
the VANOS transmission. 

Each camshaft has REVERSE threaded 
bores in their centers for the attachment of 
the timing chain sprockets on the exhaust 
cams and the VANOS transmissions for 
each intake camshaft as shown. 



CAMSHAFT POSITION IMPULSE WHEELS: The camshaft position impulse wheels pro¬ 
vide camshaft position status to the engine control module via the camshaft position sen¬ 
sors. The asymmetrical placement of the sensor wheel pulse plates provides the engine 
control module with cylinder specific position ID in conjunction with crankshaft position. 


21 






























































































































































































M62 TU VANOS CONTROL 

As the engine camshafts are rotated by the primary and secondary timing chains, the 
ME7.2 control module activates the VANOS solenoids via a PWM (pulse width modulated) 
ground signal based on a program map. The program is influenced by engine speed, load, 
and engine temperature. 

Shown below: In its inactive or default position, the valves direct 100% engine oil pres¬ 
sure flow to achieve max "retard" VANOS positioning 



MAXIMUM RETARD POSITION 


Top of next page: As the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) increases on the control sig¬ 
nal, the valve progressively opens the advance oil port and proportionately closes the 
retarded oil port. 


Oil pressure pushes the piston toward the advance position. Simultaneously the oil 
pressure on the retarded side (rear) of the piston is decreased and directed to the vent 
port in the solenoid valve and drains into the cylinder head. 


Bottom of next page: At maximum PWM control, 100% oil flow is directed to the front 
surface of the piston pushing it rearward to maximum advance. 


Varying the pulse width (on time) of the solenoids control signals proportionately regulates 
the oil pressures on each side of the pistons to achieve the desired VANOS advance angle.

VANOS SERVICE NOTES 


VALVE TIMING PROCEDURES 

Referto TVS forcomplete Valve Timing Procedures. M 62 TU valve timing adjustment is sim¬ 
ilar to the previous non-VANOS M62 engine with the exception of setting the VANOS 
transmissions to their max retard positions with an ohmmeter and attaching the camshaft 
gears to each camshaft with single reverse threaded bolts. 

After locking the crankshaft at TDC, the camshaftalignmenttools (P/N 90 88 6 112 440) 
are placed on the square blocks on the rear of the camshafts locking them in place. 

The exhaust camshaft sprockets and VANOS transmission units with timing chains are 
placed onto their respective camshafts. 

The exhaust camshaft sprockets and VANOS transmissions are secured to the 
camshafts with their respective single, reverse threaded bolt. Finger tighten only at this 
point. Install the chain tensioner into the timing chain case and tension the chain. 

Connect an ohmmeter across two of the three pin contacts on the front edge of one of 
the VANOS transmissions. Twist the inner hub of transmission to the left (counterclock¬ 
wise). Make sure the ohmmeter indicates closed circuit. This verifies that the trans¬ 
mission in the default max retard position. 

Using an open end wrench on the camshaft to hold it in place, torque the VANOS trans¬ 
mission center bolt to specification. 

CAMSHAFT IMPULSE WHEEL POSITION TOOLS 

The camshaft impulse wheels require a special tool set 
to position them correctly prior to torquing the retaining 
nuts. 

The impulse wheels are identical for each cylinder 
bank. The alignment hole in each wheel must align 
with the tool's alignment pin. Therefore the tools are 
different and must be used specifically for their bank. 

The tool rests on the upper edge of the cylinder head 
and is held in place by the timing case bolts. 

Refer to the TIS repair manual section for complete 
info rmation.

VANOS SOLENOID REPLACEMENT 


Refer to TIS repair manual section for com¬ 
plete solenoid replacement procedures. 

The solenoids are threaded into the oil distri¬ 
bution flanges through a small opening in the 
upper timing case covers. 

Special Tool 11 6 420 is required. 


VANOS TRANSMISSION RETARD POSI¬ 
TION SET UP TOOLS 

Special Tool 11 6 440 is used to rotate the 
transmission to the full retard position when 
checking the piston position with an ohmme- 
ter. 

This tool engages the inner hub of the trans¬ 
mission provides an easy method of twisting 
it to the left for the ohmmeter test. 

Refer to SI Bulletin 04 12 98 for additional 
special tool information. 


DIAGNOSIS 



The VANOS is fully compatible with the diagnostic software providing specific fault codes 
and test modules. Additionally, diagnostic requests section provides status of the PWM of 
the VANOS solenoids and camshaft position feedback via the camshaft position sensors. 
The Service Functions section of the DIS/MoDiC also provides a VANOS system test.

ENGINE PERIPHERAL COMPONENTS/SYSTEMS 


ELECTRIC THROTTLE VALVE ACTUATOR 


Similar to the original 
Bosch EML 1.2 and 1.7 
systems, the motor is con¬ 
trolled by pulse width 
modulated control signals 
providing precise plate 
positioning. The PWM sig¬ 
nal is at a basic frequency 
of 2000 Hz. 

The throttle plate position 
is monitored by two inte¬ 
grated potentiometers 
which provide DC voltage 
feedback signals to the 
ME 7.2. 



The throttle valve assembly of the M62 TU is an electric throttle valve (EDK) controlled by 
an integral EML function of the M E 7.2. The throttle plate is positioned by a gear reduction 
DC motor drive. - _

Engine idle speed control is a function of the EDK. Therefore, the M62 TU does not require 
a separate idle control valve. This M E 7.2 controlled sub-system is described in the Electric 
Throttle System Functional Description (page 32) and in the ME 7.2 Input/Output signal 
sections further on. 


HIGH PERFORMANCE PLATINUM SPARK PLUGS (NGK BKR6EQUP) 


The high performance, quad electrode spark plugs introduced with the M52 TU are also 
used on the M 62 TU and M 73 TU engines Their replacement interval is 100,000 miles. 


The platinum plated center electrode with quad 
ground electrode design provides consistent opera¬ 
tion throughout the entire service life of the plug. The 
plugs also improve cold start performance and 
improve idle quality. 



Additionally, the High performance platinum spark plugs are approved for use in M42, M44, 
M50, M52, M60, M62and M70 engines. Refer to SI Bulletin 120199 for add itional infor¬ 
mation and an updated spark plug application chart for all BMW vehicles.

FUEL INJECTORS 

The M62 TU utilizes new fuel injectors man¬ 
ufactured by Bosch. The injector pintle 
consists of a two ball seat. 

The ball seat design provides a tight seal 
when the injector is closed preventing HC 
formation in the intake. 

The injectors have an ohmic value of 15.5 
ohms. 



NON RETURN FUEL RAIL SYSTEM 


The M62 TU introduces a new method of 
meeting Running Loss Compliance without 
the use of the familiar 3/2 way running loss 
valve. 

The regulated fuel supply is controlled by the 
fuel pressure regulator integrated in the fuel 
filter. A fuel return line is located on the fuel 
filter. 

The system provides even fuel distribution to all fuel injectors due to a balance tube con¬ 
necting the feed with the end of the fuel rail. The new fuel rail does not have a fuel return 
line.

M62 TU EXHAUST SYSTEM 


The M 62 TU is equipped with two additional catalytic converters known as "warm-up con¬ 
verters". This configuration positions the forward mounted warm-up catalytic converters 
closerto the hot exhaust gasses immediately exiting the combustion chambers. The clos¬ 
er location heats the catalytic converters to the point of light-off faster than previous sys¬ 
tems. Earlier light-off reduces cold start emissions by allowing the gas conversion (HC to 
H20, CO to C02 and NOx by reduction to N2 and 02)to occur more rapidly just after cold 
start. 


The system also contains two main catalytic converters. The main exhaust gas conversion 
process occurs further downstream in the main catalytic converters.

BMW vehicles are the direct result of his studies.

The forward mounted warm-up catalytic con¬ 
verters are made of thin-wall ceramics. They 
are mounted in a pliable material called silicatex 
which isolates them from vibrations ensuring a 
long service life. 

For their relatively small size, the catalyst vol¬ 
ume of 878 cm 3 provides a large conversion 
surface area. Use of the thin-wall ceramic 
design also minimizes exhaust back pressure. 

Both pre-catalytic converter oxygen sensors 
are positioned forward of each warm-up cata¬ 
lyst.

The Bosch L5H 25 oxygen sensors are carried over from the M62 engine and provide the 
familiar "swinging" voltage signal (0.2 - max lean to 0.8 - max rich) representing oxygen 
content in the exhaust gas. 

The main catalytic converters are also made of thin-wall ceramics. The post catalytic con¬ 
verter oxygen sensors are positioned just behind the main catalytic converters to monitor 
the catalytic converter function. 

The pipes of the exhaust system up to the rear main catalytic converters are made from 
dual wall stainless steel. This design insulates exhaust noise as well as insulating the ther¬ 
mal energy in the hot exhaust gasses to light-off the converters as guickly as possible.
