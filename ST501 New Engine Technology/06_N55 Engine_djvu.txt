Engine Designation and Engine Identification 


Engine Designation 

This training material describes the N55B30M0 in detail. 

In the technical documentation, the engine designation is used for unique identification of 
the engine. In the technical documentation you will also find the abbreviated engine des¬ 
ignation, i.e. N55, that only indicates the engine type.

Engine Identification 

The engines are marked on the crankcase with an engine identification code for unigue 
identification. This engine identifier is also reguired for approval by the authorities. The 
N55 engine further develops this identification system and the code has been reduced 
from previously eight to seven characters. The engine serial number can be found under 
the engine identifier on the engine. Together with the engine identifier, this consecutive 
number enables unigue identification of each individual engine.

Engine Mechanical 


Engine Housing 

The engine housing consists of the engine block (crankcase and bedplate), cylinder 
head, cylinder head cover, oil pan and gaskets. 

Engine Block 

The engine block is made from an aluminum die-casting and consists of the crankcase 
with bedplate. 

Crankcase and Bedplate 

The crankcase features cast iron cylinder liners (2). A new feature is that the webs 
between two cylinders on the deck of the block now have a grooved cooling passage 
(3). Coolant can flow along these grooves from one side of the crankcase to the other, 
thus enhancing cooling of this area. 

Five oil return ducts on the exhaust side (4) now permit oil to return from the cylinder 
head into the oil pan. These oil return channels extend into the bedplate up to below the 
oil deflector. They help reduce churning losses as the returning engine oil can no longer 
reach the crankshaft even at high transverse acceleration. 

Five oil return channels on the intake side (5) also ensure that the blow-by gasses can 
flow unobstructed from the crankshaft area into the cylinder head and to the crankcase 
breather in the cylinder head cover. 

The cooling duct (1) in the engine block is split and coolant flows directly through it.

The crankcase has large longitudinal ventilation holes bored between the lower chambers 
of the cylinders. The longitudinal ventilation holes improve the pressure egualization, 
between the oscillating air columns that are created in the crankcase, by the up and down 
movement of the pistons. 

This enhances power by relieving the unwanted pressure that acts against the downward 
movement of the pistons. It also enhances crankcase ventilation and adds to oil service 
life by promoting the movement of blow-by gasses within the engine. 



11 

N55 Engine 




Crankshaft 


The crankshaft of the N55 is of lightweight design, at 20.3 kg it’s approximately 3 kg 
lighter than the crankshaft in the N54 engine. 

The crankshaft is made from cast iron (GGG70). The counterweights are arranged asym¬ 
metrically. There is no incremental wheel installed on the crankshaft. The timing chains 
are mounted by means of an Ml 8 central bolt.

Crankshaft Main Bearings 

As on the N54 engine, the main bearings on the crankshaft are designed as two 
component bearings free of lead. The thrust bearing is mounted at the fourth bearing 
position. 


12 

N55 Engine 
























Pistons and Rings 

A full slipper skirt type piston with a diameter of 82.5 mm is used. The first piston ring is a 
plain rectangular compression ring with a chrome-ceramic coating on the contact surface. 
The second piston ring is a tapered faced Napier type ring. The oil scrape ring is 
designed as a steel band ring with spring that is also known as VF system.

Connecting Rod and Bearings 

The size of the connecting rod of the N55 engine is 144.35 mm. A new feature is the 
specially formed hole in the small end of the connecting rod. This formed hole is 
machined wider on the lower edges of the wrist pin bushing/bore. This design evenly 
distributes the force acting on the wrist pin over the entire surface of the rod bushing and 
reduces the load at the edges, as the piston is forced downward on the power stroke.

The following graphic shows the surface load on a standard connecting rod without the

Lead-free bearing shells are used on the large connecting rod end. The material G-488 is 
used on the connecting rod side and the material G-444 on the bearing cap side. 

The size M9 x 47 connecting rod bolts are the same on the N55 and N54 connecting 
rod.

N55 Engine 








Oil Pan 


The oil pan is made from an aluminum casting. The oil deflector and the intake pipe to 
the oil pump are designed as one component. To facilitate attachment to the bedplate, 
the oil return ducts are designed so that they extend over the oil deflector. Conseguently, 
the oil return ducts end in the oil sump. 

Ducts are provided for the oil supply to the vacuum pump as it is now lubricated by 
filtered oil and not by unfiltered oil as on the N54 engine.

Electrionic Volume-controlled Oil Pump 

A modified version of the volume control oil pump of the N54 engine is used. For the first 
time a Duroplast reciprocating slide valve is installed. The volumetric flow control system 
operating principle of the oil pump is described in the E71 X6 training material under the 
”N63 Engine” available on TIS and ICR 

This type of pump delivers only as much oil as is necessary under the respective engine 
operating conditions. No surplus guantities of oil are delivered in low-load operating 
ranges. This operating mode reduces the pump work and therefore the fuel consumption 
of the engine while also slowing down the oil aging process. The pump is designed as a 
slide valve-type vane pump. In delivery mode, the pump shaft is positioned off-center in 
the housing and the vanes are displaced radially during rotation. As a result, the vanes 
form chambers of differing volume. The oil is drawn in as the volume increases and 
expelled into the oil galleries as the volume decreases. 

The oil pressure in the system (downstream of the oil filter) acts on the slide against the 
force of a compression springs in the control oil chamber. The slide element rotates 
about a pivot axis.

Oil Pump and Pressure Control 

The oil pump has been redesigned with regard to the functionality and durability of the 
Duroplast reciprocating slide valve. The oil pump used in the N55 engine is a further 
development of the shuttle slide valve volume control oil pump. The activation of the oil 
pump is adapted by the engine management and controlled through an oil pressure 
control valve. 

The delivered oil volume is controlled by means of the oil pressure, based on specific 
reguirements. The modifications, compared to previous pumps, are primarily in the pump 
activation system. The oil pressure no longer acts directly on the control piston but rather 
directly on the slide valve. The engine management activates the electrohydraulic 
pressure control valve, which affects the oil pressure at the slide valve control mechanism 
within the oil pump, altering the pump output. This has the advantage of avoiding power 
losses by running the oil pump only when needed. 

The electrohydraulic pressure control valve controls the pump output and is bolted to the 
front of the engine block. It is operated based on a characteristic map within the DME 
(ECM) which in turn is based on feedback from the oil pressure sensor. The N55 uses a 
special oil pressure sensor for this purpose which functions in the similar way as the HPI 
fuel pressure sensor.

The oil pressure generated by the oil pump (2) is delivered to the engine’s lubricating 
points and hydraulic actuators. This system uses oil pressure feed back to control the 
desired operating oil pressure. For this purpose, the oil pressure downstream of the oil 
filter (7) and engine oil-to-coolant heat exchanger (9) is adjusted by the DME (map-con¬ 
trolled) via the pressure control valve (4) to the pressure control valve (3). 

The actual generated oil pressure is registered by the oil pressure sensor (10) and 
recognized by the engine management. 

In the event of an electrical malfunction, the oil pressure is set to the default control 
setting. The pump compression springs are allowed to expand, moving the slide valve to 
its maximum oil pressure position.

The following graphics show an overview of the oil circuit of the N55. Compared to the 
N54 engine, there are considerably fewer oil ducts in the cylinder head. This is mainly due 
to the use of the new VANOS solenoid valves.

Oil Filtration and Oil Cooling 

The oil filter housing is made from Duroplast. Based on the application, two types of 
engine oil coolers may be used. Depending on the oil temperature, a thermostat on the 
oil filter housing controls the oil flow through the oil cooler. 


27 

N55 Engine 




Oil Spray Nozzles 

The N55 engine is equipped with oil spray nozzles for the purpose of cooling the piston 
crown. A special tool is required for positioning the oil spray nozzles. 

Oil Pressure 

Since the N55 engine has an oil pump with electronic volumetric flow control, it is neces¬ 
sary to measure the oil pressure precisely. For this reason, a new oil pressure sensor is 
installed. 

Advantages of the new oil pressure sensor: 

• It now measures absolute pressure (previous measured relative pressure). 

• It is characteristic map control in all speed ranges. 

Oil Level 

The oil quality sensor is used for measuring the oil level as on previous BMW engines. 

Oil Return 

The following graphics show the integrated oil deflector. It combines the following 
components: 

• Oil deflector (4) 

• Intake snorkel (5) 

The oil sump (1) and crankshaft are separated by the integrated oil deflector. Oil scraper 
edges are installed on the bedplate to direct the spray oil from the crankshaft. 

Depending on the model, the oil pan can be adapted to different installation configura¬ 
tions by simply changing the intake snorkel. The oil, flowing back from the cylinder head 
(2, 6) is directed under the oil deflector. In this way, even under high transverse accelera¬ 
tion conditions, no returning oil can reach the crankshaft and cause churning losses . 



28 

N55 Engine 








Cylinder Head 

Direct fuel injection, turbocharging and VALVETRONIC systems are combined for the first 
time on a BMW 6-cylinder engine. The cylinder head of the N55 engine is a new devel¬ 
opment. It features a very compact design and is equipped with third generation VAL¬ 
VETRONIC. 

The combination is referred to as Turbo-VALVETRONIC-Direct-Injection (TVDI). 

This system reduces C02 emission and fuel consumption by 3 - 6%. 

There are now no connections for the VANOS non-return valves as they have been 
integrated in the solenoid valves. The cylinder head also features cooling passages 
near the fuel injectors; providing indirect cooling.

29

Cylinder Head Cover 

The cylinder head cover is a new development. The accumulator for the vacuum system 
is built into the cylinder head cover. 

All components for crankcase ventilation and the blow-by channels are also integrated 
into the cylinder head cover. The non-return valves ensure that the blow-by gasses are 
reliably added to the intake air in both engine modes (NA and Boost) 

The N55 engine is eguipped with a vacuum-controlled crankcase ventilation system; 
therefore, a regulated negative pressure of approximately 38 mbar is maintained.

N55 Engine 

















Crankcase Ventilation 


The blow-by gasses flow into the settling chamber of the cylinder head cover through an 
opening located in the rear of the cover. Here, the blow-by gasses are directed through 
holes on to an impact plate, against which the oil impacts at high speed, and drains off. 
The blow-by gasses, cleaned of oil, flow via the pressure control valve (depending on 
the operating mode) through the non-return valves into the inlet pipe upstream of the 
turbocharger, or via passages in the cylinder head ahead of the intake valves. 

The separated oil is drained via a return flow duct into the oil pan. 

Naturally Aspirated Mode 

The standard function can only be used as long as a vacuum prevails in the intake air 
manifold, i.e. in naturally-aspirated engine mode. 

With the engine operating in naturally-aspirated mode, the vacuum in the intake air mani¬ 
fold opens the non-return valve (15) in the blow-by duct within the cylinder head cover. 
This draws off blow-by gasses via the pressure control valve. At the same time, the vacu¬ 
um also closes the second non-return valve (12) in the duct to the charge air intake pipe. 

The blow-by gasses flow via a distribution rail integrated in the cylinder head cover, 
through the intake passages (16) in the cylinder head, which lead directly into the intake 
ports, ahead of the valves.

Boost Mode 

As the pressure in the intake air manifold increases in boost mode, blow-by gasses can 
no longer be introduced via the passages in the cylinder head, otherwise, the boost pres¬ 
sure could enter the crankcase. A non-return valve (15) in the blow-by channel within the 
cylinder head cover closes the connection (16) to the intake air manifold. This protects 
the crankcase from excess pressure. 

The increased demand for fresh air creates a vacuum in the clean air pipe between the 
turbocharger and intake silencer. This vacuum is sufficient to open the non-return valve 
(12) and draw the blow-by gasses via the pressure control valve.

If a customer complains about high oil consumption and oil is 
discovered in the turbocharger, it should not be immediately assumed 
that the turbocharger is defective. If the oil is present in the fresh air 
pipe (before the turbocharger) then the entire engine should be 
checked.

Intake and Exhaust Valves 

The valve stems have a diameter of 5 mm on the intake valve and 6 mm on the exhaust 
valve. The larger diameter exhaust valve are hollow and filled with sodium. In addition, the 
valve seat of the exhaust valves are reinforced. 

Valve Springs 

The valve springs are different for the intake side and exhaust side.

Camshafts 


Lightweight camshafts as well as cast camshafts or a mixture of both were installed in 
N54 engines. Only lightweight construction camshafts are used on the N55 engine. 

The lightweight camshafts for the N55 are manufactured in an internal high pressure 
forming process called hydroforming. The exhaust camshaft features bearing races and 
is encapsulated in a camshaft housing. The camshaft housing reduces oil foaming during 
operation.

Overview 

The VANOS system has been optimized to provide even faster adjustment speeds of the 
VANOS units. The aluminum VANOS units are much lighter and are also less susceptible 
to soiling. It can be seen by comparing the N54 VANOS system with the N55 VANOS 
that fewer oil passages are required and that the non-return valves are no longer on the 
cylinder head but rather incorporated into the solenoid valves on N55.

VANOS Solenoid Valves 

The non-return valve with screen filter used on the N54 engine have now been integrat¬ 
ed in the VANOS solenoid valves on the N55 engine. This measure has made it possible 
to reduce the number of oil ducts in the cylinder head. The screen filters on the VANOS 
solenoid valve ensure trouble-free operation and reliably prevent the VANOS solenoid 
valve from sticking due to dirt particles. 

Cam Sensor Wheels 

The sensor wheels are now “deep-drawn” sheet metal components and no longer made 
from two parts. This design increases production accuracy while reducing manufacturing 
costs.

VALVETRONIC III 


The main differences between VALVETRONIC III and VALVETRONIC II are in the 
arrangement of the VALVETRONIC servomotor and the VALVETRONIC sensor. As in 
VALVETRONIC II, the turbulence level is increased at the end of the compression cycle 
for the purpose of optimizing the mixture formation with the use of phasing and masking 
measures. This movement of the cylinder charge improves the combustion during partial 
load operation and in catalytic converter heating mode. The guench areas also contribute 
to mixture formation. 

Phasing 

Phasing results in a lift difference between both intake valves of up to 1.8 mm in the 
lower partial load range. Conseguently, the flow of fresh air is distributed asymmetrically. 

Masking 

Masking refers to the design of the valve seats. This machining ensures that the incoming 
fresh air is aligned in such a way as to give rise to the reguired cylinder charge movement. 
The advantage of this measure is that the combustion retardation is reduced by approxi¬ 
mately 10° of crankshaft rotation. The combustion process takes place faster and a larger 
valve overlap can be achieved, thus considerably reducing NOx emissions.

Engine response is improved by the combination of VALVETRONIC III, direct injection 
and turbocharging. The response up to naturally aspirated full load is shortened on a nat¬ 
urally aspirated engine with VALVETRONIC as there is now no need wait for the intake air 
manifold to be filled. The subseguent torgue buildup as the turbocharger starts up can be 
accelerated with the partial lift setting at low engine speed. This effectively flushes out 
residual gas, thus resulting in faster torgue build-up.

Combustion Chamber Geometry 

The following graphic shows the arrangement of the individual components in the com¬ 
bustion chamber. It can be seen that the BMW (spray-guided) high precision injection 
(HPI) system is not used but rather a Bosch solenoid valve fuel injector with multi-hole 
nozzle. The fuel injection is specially adapted to the combination of VALVETRONIC III and 
turbocharging. For better illustration, a set of valves has been removed in the graphic.

Valve Lift Adjustment Overview 

As can be seen from the following graphic, the installation location of the servomotor has 
changed with VALVETRONIC III. Another new feature is that the eccentric shaft sensor is 
no longer mounted on the eccentric shaft but has been integrated into the servomotor.

VALVETRONIC Servomotor 

A brushless direct current motor (BLDC motor) is used. The BLCD motor is mainte¬ 
nance-free and very powerful, due to the contactless energy transfer system. The use of 
integrated electronic modules ensures precision control. 

The VALVETRONIC servomotor has the following special features: 

• Open concept (engine oil is directly supplied to the motor). 

• The eccentric shaft angle is determined by angle increments from the integrated 
sensor system. 

• Power consumption is reduced by about 50%. 

• Higher actuating dynamics (e.g. cylinder-selective adjustment, idle speed control, 
etc.). 

• Lightweight design is approximately 600 grams. 


Function 

Actuation of the VALVETRONIC servomotor is limited to a maximum of 40 amps. A maxi¬ 
mum of 20 amps are available over a period of > 200 milliseconds. The VALVETRONIC 
servomotor is actuated by a pulse width modulated signal. The duty cycle is between 5% 
and 98%.

Air Intake and Exhaust System 

Air Intake System 


Several functions of the air intake system have been optimized for the N55 engine: 

• The unfiltered air is routed up to the intake silencer (similar to the N54 engine). 

• The filtered air duct is completely new and simplified to accommodate the new 
turbocharger. 

• The crankcase ventilation system has been redesigned. 

• The diverter valve has been integrated into the compressor housing 
of the turbocharger. 

• The fuel tank ventilation has been correspondingly adapted. 

The design layout of the air intake system has been simplified, compared to the dual 
turbocharger set up of the N54.

Exhaust Manifold 


The exhaust manifold is air-gap insulated and designed as a six ports into two chamber 
manifold. Dividing six exhaust ports into two exhaust chambers is necessary in order to 
ensure optimum flow to the twin scroll turbocharger. The exhaust pulses from the first 
three cylinders (1 -3) feed one scroll (duct 1) of the turbo, while the last three (4-6) feed 
the second scroll (duct 2). The exhaust manifold and turbocharger are welded together 
to form one component.

Function of the Twin Scroll Turbocharger 

The system is designed so that constant exhaust gas pressure is rearly applied to the tur¬ 
bocharger. At low engine speeds, the exhaust reaches the turbine in tuned pulsed form. 
Due to this pulsation, a higher pressure ratio is temporarily reached in the turbine. Since 
the efficiency increases as the pressure rises, the pulsation improves the boost pressure 
progression and thus the torque progression of the engine. This is the case particularly at 
low engine speeds. 

To limit the back pressure and ensure that the individual cylinders do not mutually 
influence each other during the cylinder charging process, cylinders 1 - 3 (bank 1) and 
cylinders 4 - 6 (bank 2) are combined to form two exhaust channels. The exhaust gas 
pulses in the exhaust channels (1 and 2) are directed into two scrolls (spirals) within the 
turbocharger to drive the turbine wheel. This design layout makes it possible to optimally 
use the exhaust pulsations for generating boost pressure based on the firing order of the 
engine. This improves engine efficiency by enhancing throttle response and limiting 
unwanted turbo lag. 

The wastegate valve is used for the purpose of limiting the boost pressure and is already 
known from previous BMW turbo engines. It is vacuum operated and electronically con¬ 
trolled through a vacuum control solenoid by the DME (ECM). 

Diverter Valve 

The basic function of the diverter valve remains the same. The difference compared to 
the N54 engine is that the diverter valve is not operated pneumatically. The diverter valve 
on the N55 engine is an electric actuator that is controlled directly by the DME. 

The number of components has been greatly reduced by positioning the diverter valve on 
the turbocharger compressor housing. 

The diverter valve is designed to release unwanted pressure in the intake by connecting 
the pressure side of the induction system to the inlet side under deceleration. The unde¬ 
sirable peaks in the boost pressure that can occur when the throttle valve is quickly 
closed are reduced. This means the diverter valve plays an important role in terms of the 
engine acoustics while protecting the components of the turbocharger.

Catalytic Converter 


Two ceramic honeycomb structures are contained in the catalytic converter housing 
The catalytic converter has a volume of 2.7 liters. Depending on the type of vehicle 
the ceramic structures have different coatings. 

Ceramic structure 1 has a volume of 1.2 liters, a diameter of 125 mm, and contains 
600 cells. 

Ceramic structure 2 has a volume of 1.5 liters, a diameter of 125 mm, and contains 
400 cells.

Exhaust System 

With the single twin scroll turbocharger, the design of the exhaust system is less compli¬ 
cated than that of the N54 engine, with two turbochargers. In addition to a “near-engine” 
catalytic converter design, the exhaust system also features a center silencer 
and two rear silencers.

Vacuum System 

The N55 engine is equipped with a vacuum pump for generating the vacuum required by 
the brake booster and the auxiliary consumers (exhaust flaps and wastegate). A vacuum 
accumulator (built into the cylinder head cover) is used to ensure there is sufficient 
vacuum for the wastegate valve at all times.

Vacuum Pump 

The vacuum pump is similar to that used on the N63 engine. It is a two-stage pump and 
therefore has two connections. The first stage is for the brake booster and the second for 
the auxiliary consumers.

therefore takes longer to build up the vacuum here, as shown in the following diagram.

Fuel System 


Fuel Injection 

The high pressure fuel injection system (HDE) is used on the N55 engine. In contrast to 
high precision injection (HPI), HDE uses solenoid fuel injectors with multi-hole nozzles. 

The following overview shows the complete fuel injection system. The system is similar 
to the N54 fuel injection. Although the same high pressure pump, pressure sensor, and 
fuel rail are used, the high pressure fuel injection valves are new. The HDE system uses 
Bosch high pressure solenoid type fuel injection valves with the designation HDEV5.2.

Fuel Pressure Sensor 

The fuel is supplied at a primary pressure of 5 bar by the electric fuel pump from the fuel 
tank via the supply line to the high pressure pump. The primary pressure is monitored by 
the fuel pressure sensor (5). The fuel is delivered by the electric fuel pump correspond¬ 
ing to engine requirements. The fuel pressure sensor known from the N54 and N63 is 
used. 

In the event of the fuel pressure sensor failing, the electric fuel pump continues operation 
at 100% delivery rate as from terminal 15 ON.

High Pressure Fuel Pump 

The fuel is pressurized in the permanently driven three-piston high pressure pump and 
delivered to the fuel rail via the high pressure line. The fuel stored under pressure in the 
fuel rail is distributed via the high pressure lines to the high pressure fuel injection valves. 
The required fuel pressure is determined by the engine management as a function of the 
engine load and engine speed. The pressure level is registered by the rail pressure 
sensor and sent to the engine control unit. The fuel is regulated by the quantity control 
valve based on a target/actual value comparison of the rail pressure. The pressure level is 
configured such to achieve the smoothest running properties with the best possible fuel 
consumption. A pressure of 200 bar is only required at high load and low engine speed. 
The high pressure pump is of the same design as the high pressure pump used on the 
N54 engine. 


N55, fuel pressure diagram 



68 

N55 Engine 








Fuel Injectors 

The high pressure fuel injection valve Bosch HDEV5.2 is a solenoid type injector. In con¬ 
trast to the piezo-electric injectors used on the current BMW engines, the solenoid valve 
fuel injectors are designed as inward-opening multi-hole valves with highly variable jet 
angle and form. They operate at a system pressure of up to 200 bar. 


Do not open the fuel system if the coolant temperature is 
above 40°C/104°F. The residual pressure in the high pres¬ 
sure fuel system could cause bodily injury. 



It is essential to observe the utmost cleanliness when working on the high pressure fuel 
system and to follow the proper working procedures described in the repair instructions. 
Even minute soiling or damage at the thread connections of the high pressure lines could 
cause leaks. 


Note: Special tool #13 0 270 must be used to remove the HDEV5.2 high pres¬ 
sure injector valves from the engine. Damage to the injector or the relat¬ 
ed components may occur otherwise. See the Service Information sec¬ 
tion in this training material for more information. 

Particular care must be taken when working on the fuel system of the N55 engine to 
ensure that the ignition coils are not wet with fuel. The resistance of the silicone insulating 
material of the coils is greatly reduced by the contact with fuel. This could result in arcking 
at the top of the spark plug and misfiring. See the Service Information section and repair 
instructions for more information.

Cooling System 


The cooling system of the N55 is enhanced with additional oil cooling. 

Two different types of oil cooling systems are used depending on the model and appli¬ 
cation. In the “hot climate” version, heat transfer from the engine oil to the engine 
coolant is avoided by separating the oil cooler from the engine coolant circuit. The other 
version uses an auxiliary radiator in combination with an oil to coolant heat exchanger 
bolted to the oil filter housing. The auxiliary radiator enhances cooling efficiency by 
adding surface area to the cooling system.

The following graphic shows the connection of the auxiliary radiator to the cooling sys¬ 
tem. The auxiliary radiator is connected to the radiator by means of parallel coolant lines, 
thus increasing the cooling surface area. This system is combined with an oil-to-coolant 
heat exchanger mounted on the oil filter housing. (See component “C” in the previous 
graphic.)

If a separate oil to air cooler is not installed, an auxiliary radiator in 
conjuction with an oil to coolant heat exchanger is used to cool the 
engine oil.

Coolant Passages 

The coolant passages in the cylinder head are also used for indirect cooling of the fuel 
injectors. The following graphic clearly shows that the coolant flows over the valves and 
the fuel injectors, thus reducing the heat transfer to the components to a minimum.

The cast iron cylinder liners are cast into the aluminum die-casting. The deck area (webs) 
between the cylinders have grooved coolant passages. Coolant can flow along these 
grooves from one side of the block to the other, thus cooling the deck area between the 
cylinders.

Service Information 


Cylinder Head 

The combination of exhaust turbocharger, VALVETRONIC, and direct fuel injection is 
referred to asTurbo-VALVETRONIC-Direct-Injection (TVDI). 

Cylinder Head Cover 



If a customer complains about high oil consumption and oil is 
discovered in the turbocharger, it should not be immediately 
assumed that the turbocharger is defective. 

If the oil is present in the fresh air pipe after the introduction of the 
blow-by gasses then the entire engine should be checked for leaks. 
Defective gaskets or crankshaft seals may be the cause of excessively 
high blow-by gas output. 


Fuel Injectors 

In order to remove the N55 fuel injectors from the cylinder head, special tool #13 0 270 
must be utilized. Failure to use the special tool will result in damage to the injectors. 



A Do not open the high pressure fuel injection system if the coolant 
temperature is above 40°C. The residual pressure in the high 
pressure fuel system could cause bodily injury. 


77 

N55 Engine 
















A lt is essential to follow the repair instructions and observe the utmost 
cleanliness when working on the high pressure fuel system. Even 
minute soiling or damage at the connections of the high pressure lines 
and cause leaks. 

There is a new tool # 13 0 280 that must be used when replacing the PTFE seals on the 
tips of the solenoid valve injectors. As with piezoelectric injectors these seals must be 
replaced if and when the injectors are being re-installed. 



W13 0 280 


Ignition Coils 

The ignition coils of the N55 have been redesigned for better rigidity and durability. 
Particular care must be taken when working on the fuel system to ensure that the ignition 
coils are not wet with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by 
contact with fuel. This could compromise the coils insulation and result in arcking at the 
top of the spark plug causing a misfire. 

• The ignition coils must be removed before working on the fuel system. 

• When installing new solenoid valve fuel injectors utmost cleanliness must be 


observed. 


• After removing the ignition coils use a rag to prevent fuel from entering the spark 
plug well. 

• Ignition coils that have been saturated with fuel must be replaced.
