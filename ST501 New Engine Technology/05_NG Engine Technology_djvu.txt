New Generation Engine Technology 


In 2005, the first of the new generation 6-cylinder engines was introduced as the N52. 
The engine featured such innovations as a composite magnesium/aluminum engine 
block, electric coolant pump and VALVETRONIC for the first time on a 6-cylinder. 

To further increase the power and efficiency of this design, three new engines where 
introduced for the 2007 model year. These engines are the N52 K, the N51 SULEV II 
and the N54. 

The N52K (N52KP) engine is the naturally aspirated version of the new 6-cylinder 
engines. The ”K” designation indicates that there are various efficiency and cost 
optimization measures. This engine can also be referred to as the “KP” engine. 

The measures include new optimized components such as the consolidation of various 
items such as the crankcase ventilation system into the cylinder head cover. 

The N51 engine is introduced to comply with SULEV II requirements. The N51 features 
much of the same measures and technology as the previous SULEV engine, the M56. 



The N54 engine is the first turbocharged powerplant in the US market. In addition to 
turbocharging, the N54 features second generation direct injection and double VANOS. 

Based on the N54, the N63 twin turbo V8 was launched with the introduction of the E71 
xDrive50i in 2008. It features double VANOS, Dl and two turbochargers. 

In 9/2009 the successor of N73, the N74 VI2 was introduced with the launch of the 
F01/F02 760i/760Li. This engine largely based on N73 and N63 technology. 

The N55 engine is the direct successor to the N54 engine and was introduced to the 
US market with the in the launched of the F07 535i Gran Turismo in the Spring of 2010. 
Technical updates and modifications make it possible to use only one exhaust tur¬ 
bocharger. The technical data have remained virtually the same - with reduced costs and 
improved quality. 

The N55 combines for the first time VALVETRONIC III with double VANOS, direct injec¬ 
tion and turbocharging and is referred to as TVDI.

Turbocharging 


As far as gasoline engines are concerned, turbocharging has not been in widespread 
use at BMW. As a matter of fact, the last turbocharged BMW production vehicle was the 
E23 (745) which was not officially imported into the US. The previous “turbo” model 
before that was the legendary 2002 tii turbo in the early 1970’s. This 2002 tii turbo was 
also not officially imported into the US. 



Until now, BMW has built a reputation for building high performance engines which are 
naturally aspirated. Much research has gone into the development of an efficient engine 
design which meets not only the expectations of the customer, but complies with all of 
the current emissions legislation. 

Currently, the global focus has been centered around the use of alternative fuels and 
various hybrid designs. While BMW recognizes these concerns, there is still much 
development to be done on the internal combustion engine. Therefore, at least for the 
time being, BMW will continue to build the some of best internal combustion engines in 
the world. 

Turbocharging Terminology 

An engine which does not use any form of “forced induction” is referred to as a “natural¬ 
ly aspirated” engine. This means that the air which is entering the engine is at atmos¬ 
pheric pressure. Atmospheric air enters the engine due to the low pressure created dur¬ 
ing the intake stroke. 

An engine which uses “forced induction” is referred to as supercharged. This means 
that the air entering the engine is under pressure (above atmospheric). As far as termi¬ 
nology is concerned, supercharging is the broad term for this type of technology. 

Supercharging can be broken down into two categories, those engines which use a 
mechanical supercharger and those which use an exhaust driven turbocharger. Today, 
BMW is only using turbochargers.

NG Engine Technology 














Basic Principles of Turbocharging 

In order to make an engine more efficient, it is necessary to ensure an adequate supply of 
air and fuel on the intake stroke. This mixture can then be compressed and ignited to 
create the desired engine power output. A normally aspirated engine relies on the basic 
principle of gas exchange without the use of forced induction. 

The volumetric efficiency refers to the ratio between the theoretical cylinder volume and 
the actual amount of air (and fuel) filling the cylinder during the intake stroke. A naturally 
aspirated engine has a volumetric efficiency of between 0.6 and 0.9 (60-90%). With the 
turbocharged engine, volumetric efficiency can peak at over 100%. 

A turbocharger is driven by waste (exhaust) gasses and in turn drives a compressor which 
forces air into the engine above atmospheric pressure. This increase pressure allows for 
an air charge with a greater density. The result is increased torque and horsepower. 



7 

NG Engine Technology 








The turbocharger consists of a turbine and compressor assembly (1) on a common shaft 
inside of the turbocharger housing. The turbine wheel is driven by waste exhaust gases 
and in turn drives the compressor wheel. 

The compressor forces air into the intake manifold of the engine. The air entering the 
engine from the compressor is above atmospheric pressure. The increased atmospheric 
pressure allows for an air-charge that is more dense and therefore contains more oxygen. 

This increased density during the intake stroke ultimately adds up to the creation of more 
engine output torgue. Of course, this increased density must be accompanied by 
additional fuel to create the desired power. This is accomplished by engine management 
system programming to increase injector “on-time” and enhanced associated maps. 

To prevent the turbocharger from providing too much boost, a “wastegate” (6) is added to 
allow exhaust to bypass the turbine. This provides a means of control for the turbocharg¬ 
er system. The wastegate is usually actuated by a vacuum diaphragm (6) which is con¬ 
trolled via vacuum fed from solenoids. These solenoids are typically controlled by the 
engine management system. 

Once the intake air is compressed, it is also heated which is not desirable for maximum 
efficiency. To counter this situation a heat exchanger (2) is added between the compres¬ 
sor and the engine intake. This heat exchanger is commonly referred to as an intercooler. 
The intercooler is usually an air-to-air heat exchanger which is installed in the air stream 
ahead of the radiator (direct charge air cooling) or air to coolant heat exchanger (indirect 
charge air cooling). Regardless of the type, the intercooler lowers the intake air charge to 
achieve the maximum density possible. 

The use of an exhaust driven turbocharger is used to create more engine power through 
increased efficiency. In the case of the most current BMW engines, the turbocharger is 
used in conjunction with direct fuel injection. This provides the best combination of effi¬ 
ciency and power with no compromise.

Bi-turbocharging 

The induction air is precompressed in such a way that a higher air mass is admitted into 
the engine's combustion chamber. In this way, it is possible to inject and combust a 
greater quantity of fuel, which increases the engine's power output and torque. 

The turbine and the compressor can rotate at speeds of up to 200,000 rpm. 

The exhaust inlet temperature can reach a maximum of 1050°C. Because of these high 
temperatures, turbochargers are not only connected with the engine-oil system but also 
integrated in the engine-coolant circuit. 

By operating an electric coolant pump even after the engine has been switched off it is 
possible to dissipate the residual heat from the turbochargers and thus prevent the oil in 
the bearing housing from overheating. 


10 

NG Engine Technology 








Utmost importance is attached to turbochargers response characteristics. A delayed 
response to the driver's command, i.e. the accelerator-pedal position, is not acceptable. 
The driver therefore must not experience any so-called "turbo lag". 

This reguirement is met in the N54 engine with two small turbochargers, which are 
connected in parallel. Cylinders 1,2 and 3 (bank 1) drive the first turbocharger (5) while 
cylinders 4, 5 and 6 (bank 2) drive the second (2). 

The advantage of a small turbocharger lies in the fact that, as the turbocharger runs up to 
speed, the lower mass of the turbine alows it to accelerate guicker, and thus the com¬ 
pressor attains a higher boost pressure in a shorter amount of time.

Air Ducting Overview 

The fresh air is drawn in via the air cleaner (10) and the charge-air suction lines (6 + 18) 
by the compressors of turbochargers (23 + 24) and compressed. 

Because the turbochargers can get very hot during operation, they are connected with 
the engine's coolant and engine-oil circuits. The charge air is greatly heated when com¬ 
pressed in the turbocharger, making it necessary for the air to be cooled again in an 
intercooler (16). 

The compressed and cooled charge air is routed from the intercooler via the throttle valve 
(12) into the intake manifold. The system is eguipped with several sensors and actuators 
in order to ensure that the load of fresh air is optimally adapted to the engine's respective 
operating conditions.

Boost-pressure Control (Wastegate) 

The boost pressure of the turbochargers is directly dependent on the flow of exhaust gas 
which reaches the turbocharger turbines. Both the velocity and the mass of the exhaust- 
gas flow are directly dependent on engine speed and engine load. 

The engine-management system uses wastegate valves to control the boost pressure. 
These valves are operated by vacuum-pressure actuators, which are controlled via elec¬ 
tropneumatic pressure transducers by the engine-management system. 

The vacuum pressure is generated by the permanently driven vacuum pump and stored 
in a pressure accumulator. The system is designed to ensure that these loads and 
consumers do not have a negative influence on the brake-booster function. 

The exhaust-gas flow can be completely or partially directed to the turbine wheel with the 
wastegate valves. When the boost pressure has reached its desired level, the wastegate 
valve begins to open and direct part of the exhaust-gas flow past the turbine wheel. 

This prevents the turbine from further increasing the speed of the compressor. This con¬ 
trol option allows the system to respond to various operating situations.

NG Engine Technology 













In the idle phase, the wastegate valves of both turbochargers are closed. This enables 
the full exhaust-gas flow available to be utilized to speed up the compressor already at 
these low engine speeds. 

When power is then demanded from the engine, the compressor can deliver the reguired 
boost pressure without any noticeable time lag. In the full-load situation, the boost pres¬ 
sure is maintained at a consistently high level when the maximum permissible torgue is 
reached by a partial opening of the wastegate valves. In this way, the compressors are 
only ever induced to rotate at a speed which is called for by the operating situation. 

The process of the wastegate valves opening removes drive energy from the turbine such 
that no further increase in boost pressure occurs, which in turn improves overall fuel 
consumption. 

At full-load the N54 engine operates at an overpressure of up to 0.8 bar in the intake 
manifold. 

Blow-off Control (Diverter Valves) 

The blow-off valves in the N54 engine reduce unwanted peaks in boost pressure which 
can occur when the throttle valve closes guickly. They therefore have an important 
function with regard to engine acoustics and help to protect the turbocharger compo¬ 
nents. 

A vacuum pressure is generated in the intake manifold when the throttle valve is closed at 
high engine speeds. This leads to a build-up of high dynamic pressure after the 
compressor which cannot escape because the route to the intake manifold is blocked. 

This leads to a "pumping up" of the turbocharger which means that: 

• a clearly noticeable, disruptive pumping noise can be heard, 

• and this pumping noise is accompanied by a component-damaging load being 
exerted on the turbocharger, since high-freguency pressure waves exert axial 
load on the turbocharger bearings.

The blow-off valves are mechanically actuated spring-loaded diaphragm valves which are 
activated by the intake-manifold pressure as follows: 

In the event of a pressure differential before and after the throttle valve, the blow-off 
valves are opened by the intake-manifold pressure and the boost pressure is diverted to 
the intake side of the compressor. The blow-off valves open starting from a differential 
pressure of 0.3 bar. This process prevents the disruptive and component-damaging 
pumping effect from occurring. 

The system design dictates that the blow-off valves are also opened during operating 
close to idle (pressure differential Pcharger/Psuction = 0.3 bar). However, this has no 
further effects on the turbocharging system. 

The turbocharger is pressurized with the full exhaust-gas flow at these low speeds and 
already builds up a certain level of induction-air precharging in the range close to idle. 

If the throttle valve is opened at this point, the full boost pressure reguired is very guickly 
made available to the engine. 

One of the major advantages of the vacuum pressure-actuated wastegate valves is that 
they can be partially opened in the mid-range in order not to allow excessive induction-air 
precharging to the detriment of fuel consumption. In the upper load range, they assume 
the reguired control position corresponding to the necessary boost pressure.

The diverter valves in the N63 engine also reduce unwanted peaks in boost pressure 
which can occur when the throttle valve closes quickly. They therefore have an important 
function with regard to engine acoustics and help to protect the turbocharger compo¬ 
nents. As with the N54 a vacuum is generated in the intake manifold when the throttle 
valve is closed at high engine speeds. This leads to a build-up of high dynamic pressure 
after the compressor which cannot escape because the route to the intake manifold is 
blocked.

This leads to a "pumping up" of the turbocharger. 

In contrast with the N54, the diverter valves on the N63 engine are electrically operated 
valves. When the throttle valve closes, the boost pressure (upstream of the throttle valve) 
and its increase are compared with stored target values. 


The diverter valves are opened if the actual val¬ 
ues exceed the target by a certain value. As a 
result, the boost pressure is diverted to the 
intake side of the compressor. 

This procedure prevents the disruptive and 
component-damaging pumping effect from 
occurring. 



On N55 and N74 the diverter 
valve is located on the compres¬ 
sor housing. See twin-scroll 
turbo section for more information.

Charge Air Cooling 


Direct Charge Air Cooling 

Cooling the charge air in the N54 engine serves to increase power output as well as 
reduce fuel consumption. The charge air heated in the turbocharger by its component 
temperature and by compression is cooled in the intercooler by up to 80°C. 

This increases the density of the charge air and improves the charge in the combustion 
chamber. This translates in lower boost pressure reguired which in turn reduces the risk 
of knock which improves engine efficiency. 


N54 Direct charge air cooling (airto air) 



Indirect Charge Air Cooling 

Indirect charge air cooling was used for the first time on the N63 engine. 

The charge air is cooled by means of an air-to-coolant heat exchanger. Therefore, 
the N63 engine features a separate self contained low-temperature coolant circuit. 

The charge air heated in the turbocharger by its component temperature and by com¬ 
pression is cooled in the intercooler by up to 80°C. This results in increased power out¬ 
put and reduced fuel consumption. 

As with direct charge air cooling, the increased density of the charge air improves the 
charge in the combustion chamber and results in lower boost pressure reguired which 
reduces the risk of knock improves engine efficiency. 


18 

NG Engine Technology 



Indirect charge air cooling has the advantage of reguiring little space as the system can 
be mounted directly on the engine. Due to the near-engine installation position, the dis¬ 
tinctly shorter pipe length reguired for charge air routing also have a positive effect. 

In this way, pressure loss has been substantially reduced, thus improving power yield and 
engine response.

Function of the Twin Scroll Turbocharger 

The system is designed so that constant exhaust gas pressure is rearly applied to the tur¬ 
bocharger. At low engine speeds, the exhaust reaches the turbine in tuned pulsed form. 
Due to this pulsation, a higher pressure ratio is temporarily reached in the turbine. Since 
the efficiency increases as the pressure rises, the pulsation improves the boost pressure 
progression and thus the torque progression of the engine. This is the case particularly at 
low engine speeds. 

The response characteristics of the twin scroll turbocharger are enhanced when com¬ 
pared to a single scroll setup. The turbocharger turbines are fed through two separate 
channels within the turbine housing (highlighted red in the graphic above). Each of these 
channels or “scrolls” is always fed by the exhaust pulses from the same two cylinders. 

To limit the back pressure and ensure that the individual cylinders do not mutually 
influence each other during the cylinder charging process, cylinders 1 - 3 (bank 1) and 
cylinders 4 - 6 (bank 2) are combined to form two exhaust channels. The exhaust gas 
pulses in the exhaust channels (1 and 2) are directed into two scrolls (spirals) within the 
turbocharger to drive the turbine wheel. This design layout makes it possible to optimally 
use the exhaust pulsations for generating boost pressure based on the firing order of the 
engine. This improves engine efficiency by enhancing throttle response and limiting 
unwanted turbo lag. 

The wastegate valve is used for the purpose of limiting the boost pressure and is already 
known from previous BMW turbo engines. It is vacuum operated and electronically con¬ 
trolled through a vacuum control solenoid by the DME (ECM). 

Diverter valve 

The basic function of the diverter valve remains the same. The difference compared to 
the N54 engine is that the diverter valve is not operated pneumatically. The diverter valve 
on the N55 engine is an electric actuator that is controlled directly by the DME. 

As with N74 the number of components has been greatly reduced by positioning the 
diverter valve on the turbocharger compressor housing. 

The diverter valve is designed to release unwanted pressure in the intake by connecting 
the pressure side of the induction system to the inlet side under deceleration. The unde¬ 
sirable peaks in the boost pressure that can occur when the throttle valve is quickly 
closed are reduced. This means the diverter valve plays an important role in terms of the 
engine acoustics while protecting the components of the turbocharger.

Tuned Pulsed Exhaust Manifold 


The exhaust manifold is air-gap insulated and designed as a six ports into two chamber 
manifold. Dividing six exhaust ports into two exhaust chambers is necessary in order to 
ensure optimum flow to the twin scroll turbocharger. The exhaust pulses from the first 
three cylinders (1 -3) feed one scroll (duct 1) of the turbo, while the last three (4-6) feed 
the second scroll (duct 2). The exhaust manifold and turbocharger are welded together to 
form one component.

Load Control 

Load control is effected by means of the throttle valve and the waste gate valves. 

The throttle valve is the primary component in this process. The wastegate valves are 
actuated to bring about a fine tuning of the boost pressure. At full load the throttle valve 
is completely open and load control is undertaken by the wastegate valves. 

The load-control graphic shows that the wastegate valves are integrated in load control in 
all operating situations of the N54 engine on the basis of map control.

Controlled Variables 

The following variables, among others, influence control of the engine's boost pressure: 

• Intake-air temperature 

• Engine speed 

• Throttle-valve position 

• Ambient pressure 

• Intake-manifold pressure 

• Pressure before the throttle valve (reference variable) 

The electropneumatic pressure transducers are activated by the engine control unit on 
the basis of these variables. The result of this activation can be checked from the boost 
pressure achieved, which is measured before the throttle valve. 

There follows a comparison of the boost pressure achieved with the setpoint data from 
the program map, which can if necessary give rise to an activation correction. 

The system therefore controls and monitors itself during operation.

Service Information 


Limp-home Mode 

In the event during operation of malfunctions, implausible values or failure of any of the 
sensors involved in turbocharger control, activation of the wastegate valves is shut down 
and the valve flaps are thus fully opened. Turbocharging ceases at this point. 

The list below sets out those components or functional groups in which a failure, a mal¬ 
function or implausible values result in boost-pressure control being deactivated. The 
driver is alerted to a fault of this type via an EML indication. 

• High-pressure fuel system 

• Inlet VANOS 

• Exhaust VANOS 

• Crankshaft sensor 

• Camshaft sensor 

• Boost-pressure sensor 

• Knock sensors 

• Intake-air temperature sensor 

One principle of vehicle repair is particularly important in this respect: 

It is important to focus on the causes rather than the effects. 

With regard to the diagnosis and subseguent repair of turbocharging components, it is 
important to ensure that they are also actually identified as defective components with 
the diagnostic technology available. 

It is always vital to ensure that the cause of the fault is determined and rectified and that 
if necessary work is not carried out on symptoms of fault conseguences. 

Thus, for instance, a leaking flange on the intercooler can have far-reaching 
conseguences.

NG Engine Technology 





When diagnosing a turbo complaint always follow the three golden rules of procedure: 

1. Do not rashly trace loss of power and engine malfunctions back to the turbocharger. 
To avoid the replacement of turbochargers which are in perfect working order, the 
following should be observed: 

When blue smoke emerges from the exhaust system, check whether the air cleaner 
is contaminated or the engine is consuming too much oil because of wear. Or, if the 
crankcase ventilation system is faulty. Only then resort to checking the turbocharger. 
If the turbocharger is running too loud, inspect all the connections on the tur¬ 
bocharger pressure side. If black smoke or a loss of power is detected, in this case 
too check the engine and the connecting pipes first. 

2. Main causes of turbocharger damage: 

• Insufficient lubrication and conseguently bearing failure. Compressor and 
turbine wheels will grind in the housings, the seals will be damaged and the 
shaft may also shear off. 

• Foreign bodies damage the turbine and impeller. The resulting imbalance will 
reduce efficiency and may cause rotor damage. 

• Contaminated oil causes scoring on shaft journals and bearings. Oilways and 
seals will become clogged and cause oil leakage. Elements entering the tur¬ 
bocharger system from the outside such as sand, dirt, screws and the like will 
be trapped by a filter before the compressor. 

Service the filters at regular intervals (service intervals). Make sure to keep the 
clean-air area of the air cleaner and the air ducting to the compressors clean 
and free from all types of debris. 

3. Do not make any alterations to the turbocharger: Never attempt to alter the boost- 
pressure control linkage. The turbocharger has been optimally configured at the 
factory. If the turbocharger operates at higher boost pressures than permitted by 
the engine manufacturer, the engine may run hot and pistons, cylinder heads or 
engine bearings may fail, or the safety function of the engine electronics may 
respond and activate the engine's limp-home program.

Direct Injection 


The term “direct injection” refers to a fuel injection system which injects fuel directly into 
the combustion chamber rather than into the intake manifold. This technology has been 
around since the 1930’s, but has not been in widespread use until the late 20th century. 


The early development of this type of injection system took place in Germany in 1937 
on an aircraft engine. The first passenger car to run on direct engine was a car called the 
“Gutbrod” in the early 50’s. 



Due to the complexity and cost of the direct injection system, the technology did not 
take hold. Later, the development of more cost efficient components and the need for a 
more efficient internal combustion engine, the Dl engine made a comeback in the late 
1990’s. 

The first application of this technology on a BMW was in 2003 on the 760Li. The new 
N73 V-12 engine utilized direct injection with the combination of VALVETRONIC and the 
latest direct injection technology. 

For the 2007 model year, BMW introduced the N54 engine with direct fuel injection. It 
combined (for the first time) turbocharging with the second generation of direct injection 
(Dl 2), referred to as High Precision Injection (HPI). 


28 

NG Engine Technology 





Direct Injection Principles 

As the name suggest, the direct injection (Dl) system uses a fuel injector which sprays 
fuel directly into the combustion chamber. The fuel injection pressure (N73) is from 80 to 
120 bar. The A/F mixture in a Dl engine is formed inside of the combustion chamber. 

In comparison, a manifold injection system sprays fuel into the intake manifold or into the 
intake port near the intake valve. In this case, the A/F mixture is formed outside of the 
combustion chamber. The injection pressure on most manifold injection systems is 
between 3 and 5 bar. 



Manifold injection system Direct injection system 


I nxgcci | 

The Dl system allows for increased engine efficiency and has several distinct advantages 
over manifold injection systems: 

• The fuel is evaporated and atomized in the combustion chamber, which provides a 
“cooling effect” on combustion. A cooler combustion chamber allows an increase in 
air density, which allows for more available oxygen. In addition, cooler combustion 
allows for an increase in compression ratio which eguates to improved efficiency and 
engine power. 

• By injecting the fuel directly into the combustion chamber, there is less possibility for 
fuel to condense or accumulate on the manifold walls or the back of the intake valve. 
This results in less fuel needed to achieve the desired A/F ratio. 

• The increased injection pressure causes the fuel droplet size to be reduced. This 
allows for improved atomization and therefore improved mixture formation. 


29 

NG Engine Technology 




Mixture Formation 


In a conventional (manifold injection) engine, the air fuel mixture is formed outside of the 
combustion chamber. In contrast, the mixture must be formed inside the combustion 
chamber in a Dl engine. 

A Dl fuel system has two basic operating concepts: 

• Homogeneous Mixture Formation - A homogeneous mixture means that the 
A/F ratio is stoichiometrically controlled much in the same way as a manifold 
injection system. This means that the A/F mixture is evenly spread throughout 
the combustion chamber. One of the primary advantages of this arrangement is 
that a conventional three-way catalytic converter can be used. Also, the sulfur con¬ 
tent of the fuel is not a factor which allows the engine to be used in all global mar¬ 
kets. Currently, BMW only uses engines which operate in this mode (mostly at 
Lambda = 1). 

• Stratified Mixture Formation - In the stratified injection method, a homogeneous 
mixture is only created around the area of the spark plug. A lean (inhomogeneous) 
mixture exists in the rest on the combustion chamber. Therefore the overall A/F 
mixture in the combustion chamber is lean (lambda > 1). This results in increased 
combustion chamber temperature, and subsequently increased NOx emissions. 

The increased NOx requires the use of a DeNOx catalyst which is not effective when 
sulfur is present in the fuel. Therefore, sulfur free fuel must be used which is not 
readily available in all markets. For the time being, BMW does not have any engines 
which operate in “stratified charge” in the US market.

As the above chart shows, the use of load stratification (1) is only possible in a limited 
load and speed range. Over and above this load and speed range, the engines can only 
be operated in homogeneous mode (2-3). 

Through the deployment of VALVETRONIC, the N73 engine in the middle torgue/speed 
range (1) demonstrates the same consumption advantages as engines of other manufac¬ 
turers with charge stratification. 

Because large-capacity engines are mainly operated in the lower to middle load and 
speed range, it is only advisable to use load stratification in these engines. 

Smaller-sized engines are mainly operated in the high load and speed range and thus in 
homogeneous mode. 

Current BMW engines operate mostly in the homogeneous mode with a lambda value of 1. 
In the US market, BMW does not use a “stratified charge” engine due to the fact that 
these engines emit high NOx levels.

High Precision Injection 

The BMW High Precision Injection (HPI) is the second generation of direct injection 
(Dl 2) for BMW. The first generation was on the N73 engine in 2003. The HPI system 
was introduced in the N54 and is currently also used on N63, S63 and the N74 VI2 
engine. 

The term “high precision” refers to the precise metering and directional control of the 
atomized fuel. Also, the injection process now allows for multiple injection events due to 
the use of piezo injectors. The HPI system represents a key function in the concept for 
the most economical use of fuel without compromising performance. 



High precision injection allows for a more precise metering of the fuel injection process 
and therefore permits a higher compression ratio of 10.2 to 1. This compression ratio is 
guite high considering the N54 is turbocharged. However, the “spray guided” injection 
process cools the air charge and decreases the possibility of unwanted engine knock. 
The operating pressure of the HPI system is up to 200 bar. 


32 

NG Engine Technology 




High-precision injection represents the key function in the concept of using the less fuel 
as possible. The new generation of gasoline direct injection satisfies the 
expectations placed on it with regard to economic efficiency without compromising the 
engine's dynamic gualities (Efficient Dynamics). 

High-precision injection provides for a more precise metering of mixture and higher 
compression - ideal preconditions for increasing efficiency and significantly reducing 
consumption. 

This is made possible by locating the piezo injector centrally between the valves. In this 
position, the new injector (which opens in an outward direction) distributes a particularly 
uniform amount of fuel into the combustion chamber in a tapered shaped spray pattern. 

The new direct injection of BMW HPI spark ignition engines operate according to the 
spray-guided process. 

HPI Function 

The fuel is delivered from the fuel tank by the electric fuel pump via the feed line (5) at an 
“feed” pressure of 5 bar to the high pressure pump. The feed pressure is monitored by 
the low-pressure sensor (6). The fuel is delivered by the electric fuel pump in line with 
demand. 

If this sensor fails, the electric fuel pump continues to run at 100% delivery with terminal 
15 ON. 

On N54 and N55 The high pressure pump is driven “in-tandem” with the vacuum pump 
which is driven by the oil pump chain drive assembly.(See HDE for more information) 

The fuel is compressed in the permanently driven three-plunger high-pressure pump (8) 
and delivery through the high-pressure line (9) to the rail (3). The fuel accumulated under 
pressure in the rail in this way is distributed via the high-pressure lines (1) to the piezo 
injectors (2). 

The high pressure injection pump on 
the N63 and N74 is of a more compact 
design. It is mounted on the cam cover 
and driven by a triple cam on the 
exhaust cam on the N63 and by the 
intake cam on the N74. Please refer to 
the appropriate training information or 
repair instructions for 
more details.

NG Engine Technology 




The required fuel delivery pressure is determined by the engine-management system as 
a function of engine load and engine speed. The pressure level reached is recorded by 
the high-pressure sensor (4) and communicated to the engine control unit. 

Control is effected by the fuel-supply control valve (7) byway of a setpoint/actual-value 
adjustment of the rail pressure. Configuration of the pressure is geared towards best 
possible consumption and smooth running of the engine. 200 bar is required only at 
high load and low engine speed.

High Pressure Pump Function and Design 

The fuel is delivered via the supply passage (6) at the admission pressure generated by 
the electric fuel pump to the high-pressure pump. From there, the fuel is directed via the 
fuel supply control valve (4) and the low-pressure non-return valve (2) into the fuel cham¬ 
ber (14) of the plunger-and-barrel assembly. The fuel is placed under pressure in this 
plunger-and-barrel assembly and delivered via the high pressure non-return valve (9) to 
the high pressure port (7).

The high-pressure pump is connected with the vacuum pump via the drive flange (11) 
and is thus also driven by the chain drive, i.e. as soon as the engine is running, the three 
plungers (12) are permanently set into up-and-down motion via the pendulum disc (10). 

Fuel therefore continues to be pressurized for as long as new fuel is supplied to the 
high-pressure pump via the fuel-supply control valve (4). The fuel-supply control valve is 
activated by means of the engine management connection (3) and thereby admits the 
quantity of fuel required. 


Pressure control is effected via the fuel-supply control valve by opening and closing of the 
fuel supply channel. The maximum pressure in the high-pressure area is limited to 245 
bar. If excessive pressure is encountered, the high-pressure circuit is relieved by a 
pressure-limiting valve via the ports (8 and 5) leading to the low-pressure area. 

This is possible without any problems because of the incompressibility of the fuel, i.e. the 
fuel does not change in volume in response to a change in pressure. The pressure peak 
created is compensated for by the liquid volume in the low-pressure area. 


Volume changes caused by temperature changes are compensated for by the thermal 
compensator (1), which is connected with the pump oil filling. 


Pressure Generation in High-pressure Pump 

The plunger (2) driven by the pendulum disc presses 
oil (red) into the metal diaphragm (1) on its upward 
travel. The change in volume of the metal diaphragm 
thereby reduces the available space in the fuel 
chamber. The fuel thereby placed under pressure 
(blue) is forced into the rail. 

The fuel-supply control valve controls the fuel 
pressure in the rail. It is activated by the engine 
management system via a pulsewidth modulated 
(PWM) signal. 

Depending on the activation signal, a restrictor cross- 
section of varying size is opened and the fuel-mass 
flow required for the respective load point is set. 
There is also the possibility of reducing the pressure 
in the rail.

Limp-home Mode 

If a fault is diagnosed in the system, such as e.g. failure of the high-pressure sensor, the 
fuel-supply control valve is de-energized; the fuel then flows via a so-called bypass into 
the rail. 

In the event of HPI limp-home mode, turbocharging is deactivated by an opening of the 
wastegate valves. 

Causes of HPI limp-home mode can be: 

• Implausible high-pressure sensor values 

• Failure of the fuel-supply control valve 

• Leakage in the high-pressure system 

• Failure of the high-pressure pump 

• Failure of the high-pressure sensor

Fuel System Safety 

Working on this fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. The 
coolant temperature must not exceed 40 °C. This must be observed without fail because 
otherwise there is a danger of fuel sprayback on account of the residual pressure in the 
high-pressure system. 

When working on the high-pressure fuel system, take particular care to ensure conditions 
of absolute cleanliness and follow the work seguences described in the repair 
instructions. Even the tiniest contaminants and damage to the screw connections on the 
high-pressure lines can cause leaks.

Piezo Fuel Injectors 

The outward-opening piezo-injector makes it possible to spray direct injection on to the 
top of the cylinder. This component ensures that the injected fuel spray cone remains 
stable, even under the prevailing influences of pressure and temperature in the combus¬ 
tion chamber. 


The extremely guick opening of the nozzle needle of the piezo-injector permits injection 
pressures of up to 200 bar. Thus it is possible to inject fuel into the combustion chamber 
under the extreme conditions of the power cycles limited by the valve opening times. 



The piezo-injector is located in the center of the cylinder head, next to the spark plug, 
between the intake and exhaust valves. This installation position prevents the cylinder 
walls or the piston crown from being wet with injected fuel. A uniform formation of the 
homogeneous air/fuel mixture is obtained with the aid of the gas movement in the com¬ 
bustion chamber and a stable fuel spray cone. 

The gas movement is influenced on the one hand by the geometry of the intake 
passages and on the other hand by the shape of the piston crown. The injected fuel is 
swirled in the combustion chamber with the boost air until a homogeneous mixture is 
available throughout the compression space at the point of ignition. 


Note: When working on the fuel system, it is important to ensure that the 

ignition coils are not saturated with fuel. The resistance of the silicone 
material is significantly reduced when wet with fuel. This can cause 
arcing at the spark-plug and lead to misfires. 

• Before making modifications to the fuel system, remove the ignition coils and protect 
the spark-plug holes against spilled fuel with a shop rag. 

• Before refitting the piezo-injector, remove the ignition coils and ensure absolute 
cleanliness. 

• Ignition coils that have been heavily saturated with fuel must be replaced. 



HPI uses piezo injectors and HDE uses solenoid type injectors. 
See N55 training material.

Injector Design and Function 

The piezo-injector essentially consists of three sub-assemblies. The expansion of the 
energized piezo-element lifts the nozzle needle outwards from its valve seat. To be able 
to counter the different operating temperatures with comparable valve lifts, the injector 
has a thermal compensating element.

The nozzle needle is pressed outwards 
from its tapered valve seat. This opens up 
an annular orifice. The pressurized fuel 
flows through this annular orifice and forms 
a hollow cone, the spray angle of which is 
not dependent on the backpressure in the 
combustion chamber. 

Do not attempt to clean the 
injectors in any way. This 
may result in damage which 
can effect the spray pattern. 

Any divergence in the spray 
pattern can cause damage to 
the spark plug or the engine 
itself.

The spray cone (1) of a piezo-injector can diverge during operation (2). Due to the forma¬ 
tion of soot inside the engine, such divergence is perfectly normal and acceptable to a 
certain extent. If, however, spray divergence reaches the stage where it begins to spray 
the spark plug wet, the spark plug may incur damage.

Replace the Teflon sealing ring when fitting and removing the piezo¬ 
injector. This also applies when an injector that has just been fitted 
has to be removed again after an engine start. 


A piezo-injector provided with a new Teflon sealing ring should be fit¬ 
ted as quickly as possible because the Teflon sealing ring could swell 
up. Please observe the repair instructions and follow without fail. 


When fitting, make sure that the piezo injector is correctly seated. 
The hold-down element for securing the piezo-injectors must rest on 
both injector tabs, otherwise the necessary force is not applied to the 
piezo-injector. Do not clean the nozzle-needle tip of the piezo-injec¬ 
tor.

NG Engine Technology 












Injection Strategy 

Injection of the fuel mass required for the operating situation can take place in up to three 
individual injections. Which option is used in the relevant operating situation is 
dependent on engine load and speed. Here, the actual time resulting from the engine 
speed available for metering the fuel is an important framework quantity. 

A special situation during the operation of any engine is the range in which a high load 
occurs at low engine speed, so-called "Low End Torque" operation. In this operating 
situation, the required fuel mass is metered to the engine in three individual injections. 

This results in a highly effective mixture formation which in the final analysis has the 
effect of both increasing power output and saving fuel. 

In order to bring the catalytic converters up to operating temperature as quickly as 
possible, the system has a catalyst-heating mode for when the engine is started from 
cold. In this mode, combustion heat is intentionally introduced into the exhaust train and 
not used first and foremost to develop power output. 

The point of ignition is moved to 30° (crankshaft degrees) afterTDC. The main quantity 
of the required fuel is injected before TDC and mixed with the boost air. The piston is 
situated after TDC in its downward travel such that the air/fuel mixture is already expand¬ 
ing again, which reduces the ignitability of the mixture at the spark plug. 

In order to ignite the mixture reliably, a small residual quantity of fuel is injected 25° after 
TDC and this guarantees an ignitable mixture at the spark plug. This small fuel quantity 
therefore provides for ignition of the residual charge in the combustion chamber. 

This operating mode is set by the engine-management system after a maximum period 
of 60 seconds from engine starting but is terminated if the catalytic-converter response 
temperature is reached earlier.

Piezo Element 

The movement of the nozzle needle in the injector is generated by a piezo-element. 

A piezo-element is an electromechanical converter, i.e. it consists of a ceramic material 
which converts electrical energy directly into mechanical energy (force/travel). A familiar 
application is the piezo cigarette lighter - when a piezo-crystal is pressed, voltage is 
generated until a spark flashes and ignites the gas. 

In the case of the piezo-actuator, voltage is generated so that the crystal expands, in order 
to achieve greater travel, it is possible to design a piezo-element in several layers. 

The actuator module consists of layers of the piezo-ceramic material connected 
mechanically in series and electrically in parallel. The deflection of a piezo-crystal is 
dependent on the applied voltage up to a maximum deflection; the higher the voltage, the 
greater the travel.

Injector Adjustment 

When the injectors are manufactured, a multitude of measurement data is recorded at 
specific points in the factory. In this way, the tolerance ranges for injector-guantity 
adjustment are determined and specified in a six-digit number combination. 

Information on the lift performance of the injector is also added for injector voltage 
adjustment. Injector adjustment is reguired because of the individual voltage demand of 
each piezo actuator. An allocation is made to a voltage demand category, which is 
included in the number combination on the injector. 

These data items are transmitted to the ECM. During engine operation, these values are 
used to compensate for deviations in the metering and switching performance. 



When replacing an injector, it is absolutely essentially to carry out an 
injector adjustment. 


43 

NG Engine Technology 













Injector Control and Adaptation 

The fuel mass required for the operating situation is injected by the piezo-injector into the 
combustion chamber. This mass can be influenced by three correcting variables: 

• the rail pressure 

• the injector opening time 

• the injector opening lift 

The injector opening time and the injector opening lift are activated directly at the piezo 
injector. The opening time is controlled via the ti signal and the opening lift via the energy 
quantity in the activation of the piezo-injector. 

Injector Adaptation 

The fuel masses and injection cycles determined from the load/speed map are included 
in a pilot-control program map. Here, while further framework parameters are taken into 
consideration, the energy quantities and injector opening times required to activate the 
injectors are determined. 

The N54 engine can be safely and reliably operated with these program-map values. 


44 

NG Engine Technology 




Optimization 

For optimization of: 

• Emission values 

• Smooth running 

• Fuel consumption 

• Power output 

the controlled variables of energy quantities and injector opening times are continuously 
monitored. This occurs on a bank-selective basis byway of lambda closed-loop control. 

The residual oxygen in the exhaust gas is measured in each case for cylinder bank 1 and 
cylinder bank 2. This measurement result is compared with the values expected from 
the set correcting variables. The result of a deviation is that the injector opening signal is 
adapted. This adaptation is stored in the control unit and is therefore available for 
subsequent engine operation. Flowever, these stored values are lost when the system is 
flashed and must be relearned. A further adaptation of the injector activation takes place 
depending on time and use. This cylinder-selective adaptation involves a check of the 
residual-oxygen content with a conclusion as to the cylinder causing the situation. To this 
end, it is necessary for part of the exhaust-gas flow not to be swirled in the turbocharger. 
For this reason, the flap of the wastegate valve must be fully opened, i.e. swung out of the 
exhaust-gas flow. This wastegate-flap position extends beyond its normal opening posi¬ 
tion in engine operation. Based on the result of this cylinder-selective monitoring, the 
energy quantity is adapted if necessary to activate the injectors. 

Furthermore, the cylinder-selective adaptation includes if necessary an adaptation of the 
injector opening signal based on smooth running monitoring of the N54 engine. Overall 
adaptation of the injectors is limited to a 15% additional quantity.

high precision injection (HPI), HDE uses solenoid fuel injectors with multi-hole nozzles. 

The following overview shows the complete fuel injection system. The system is similar 
to the N54 fuel injection. Although the same high pressure pump, pressure sensor, and

VALVETRONIC III 


The main differences between VALVETRONIC III and VALVETRONIC II are in the 
arrangement of the VALVETRONIC servomotor and the VALVETRONIC sensor. As in 
VALVETRONIC II, the turbulence level is increased at the end of the compression cycle 
for the purpose of optimizing the mixture formation with the use of phasing and masking 
measures. This movement of the cylinder charge improves the combustion during partial 
load operation and in catalytic converter heating mode. The quench areas also con¬ 
tribute to mixture formation. 

Phasing 

Phasing results in a lift difference between both intake valves of up to 1.8 mm in the 
lower partial load range. Consequently, the flow of fresh air is distributed asymmetrically. 

Masking 

Masking refers to the design of the valve seats. This machining ensures that the incom¬ 
ing fresh air is aligned in such a way as to give rise to the required cylinder charge move¬ 
ment. The advantage of this measure is that the combustion retardation is reduced by 
approximately 10° of crankshaft rotation. The combustion process takes place faster and 
a larger valve overlap can be achieved, thus considerably reducing NOx emissions.

(HPI) system is not used but rather a Bosch solenoid valve fuel injector with multi-hole 
nozzle. The fuel injection is specially adapted to the combination of VALVETRONIC III and 
turbocharging. For better illustration, a set of valves has been removed in the graphic.

NG Engine Technology 

















The VALVETRONIC III servomotor contains a sensor for determining the position of the 
motor and the eccentric shaft. The servomotor is lubricated with engine oil by means of 
an oil spray nozzle (1) aimed directly at the worm drive and the eccentric shaft mecha¬ 
nism.

VALVETRONIC Servomotor 

A brushless direct current motor (BLDC motor) is used. The BLCD motor is mainte¬ 
nance-free and very powerful, due to the contactless energy transfer system. The use of 
integrated electronic modules ensures precision control. 

The VALVETRONIC servomotor has the following special features: 

• Open concept (engine oil is directly supplied to the motor). 

• The eccentric shaft angle is determined by angle increments from the integrated 
sensor system. 

• Power consumption is reduced by about 50%. 

• Higher actuating dynamics (e.g. cylinder-selective adjustment, idle speed control, 
etc.). 

• Lightweight design is approximately 600 grams. 


Function 

Actuation of the VALVETRONIC servomotor is limited to a maximum of 40 amps. A maxi¬ 
mum of 20 amps are available over a period of > 200 milliseconds. The VALVETRONIC 
servomotor is actuated by a pulse width modulated signal. The duty cycle is between 5% 
and 98%.
