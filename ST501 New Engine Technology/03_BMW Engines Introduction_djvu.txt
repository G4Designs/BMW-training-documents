BMW Engines Introduction 


6 Cylinder Engines 


Previously in 2005, BMW introduced the beginning of a new generation (NG) of six cylin¬ 
der engines with the N52. Since then, BMW has introduced 3 new variations of the 
NG6 engine family. 



The first of the new engines is the N54, which made its debut in the new 3-series coupe 
in September 2006. The N54 is turbocharged and uses the second generation of 
direct injection (Dl 2). This engine was introduced in the 335i coupe in the fall of 2006. 


The N52 was eventually replaced by the N52KP. The N52KP engine is an improved 
and cost optimized version of the N52. The N52KP was introduced in the 328i and 
328xi coupe from September 2006 and replaced the N52 in various models. 


The N51 (which is a SULEVII compatible engine) was phased into selected 
production models from 9/06. The N51 features many of the same features of the 
previous SULEV engine (M56) including a “Zero Evap” system. 

Finally, the N55 engine is the successor to the N54 and was introduced to the US mar¬ 
ket with the launch of the F07 535i Gran Turismo in the Spring of 2010. Re-engineering 
and modifications have made it possible to now use only one exhaust turbocharger. 
Against the backdrop of reduced costs and improved guality, the technical data has 
remained virtually the same.

New Generation Engine 
Designations 

A new engine numbering system was intro¬ 
duced to enable fast and distinct 
identification. 

The “TU” designation was dropped togeth¬ 
er with the associated version 
number which is now replaced by a simple 
count number at the end of the engine 
designation. 

The codes T through K are also new for the 
various power stages instead of the previ¬ 
ous “OL” or “UL” designations. 

For example, the new N52KP engine which is a variant of the original N52 engine will 
now be known as the N52B30O1. This would be instead of the traditional “TU” suffix 
as in - N52B30TU. 

The block stamping (above) is located in the same place as the previous N52 engine. 
The chart on the opposing page shows the breakdown of the new engine designations.

BMW Engines Introduction 



N52KP Engine Overview 

The enhanced and improved version of the original N52 is referred to as the N52KP or 
more accurately the N52B30O1. This engine includes cost saving measures as well as 
various technical improvements. The N52KP will eventually replace the N52 in all vehicle 
applications. One of the first vehicles to use the N52KP was the 328i coupe (E92). 

The technical highlights of the N52KP include: 

• New engine management (MSV80) 

• New HFM (digital) 

• New throttle - EGAS8 with magnetoresistive position feedback 

• Plastic valve cover with integrated crankcase vent valve and oil separation 

• Stronger connecting rods 

• Exhaust valve stem increased to 6mm 

• New electric water pump (2nd generation) 

• Lightweight camshafts (hydroformed) 



6 

BMW Engines Introduction 




The N52KP will be available in three versions as follows: 

• N52B30O1 - High Output version with 260hp 

• N52B30M1 - Medium Output version with 230hp 

• N52B30U1 - Possible future application with 215hp 

Each of the above engines will have a different specific output for installation into various 
models. For example, the E83 LCI (X3 3.0si) will receive the “O” version which has a 
power output of 260 horsepower at 6600 rpm.

N51 Overview 

In order to comply with SULEV requirements, the N51 is another variant of the N52 
engine. There are various measures to meet the EPA/CARB standards, some of which 
are familiar from the previous SULEV (M56) engine. 

Some of the SULEV measures for the N51 include: 

• Near engine catalyst with additional underbody catalyst 

• Secondary air system 

• Optimized combustion chamber geometry in cylinder head 

• Modified piston crown for lower compression 

• Plastic valve cover with integrated crankcase vent valve and separator (from N52KP) 

• Stainless steel fuel lines with threaded connections 

• Radiator with “Prem-air” coating 

• Throttle system - EGAS08 carried over from N52KP 

• Airbox with Activated carbon filter for EVAP control 

• Purge system pipes are made from “optimized” plastic

N54 Engine Overview 

The first new member of the NG6 family was the N54 which was initially available in the 
E92 335i. The N54 continues the tradition of “efficient dynamics” by meeting the cus¬ 
tomer demand for high performance and the necessary requirements of low fuel con¬ 
sumption and emissions. 

The N54 is available as a 3.0 liter engine and features the following: 

• Exhaust driven turbochargers (Bi-turbo) 

• Air to air Intercooler 

• 2nd Generation Direct Injection (HPI) with piezo injectors 

• New engine management (MSD80) 

• Bi-VANOS 

• All aluminum crankcase with iron cylinder liners (similar dimensions to N52) 

• External oil cooler 

• New high output electric water pump (400 W) 

• Aluminum cylinder head with plastic valve cover 

• Steel crankshaft 



10 

BMW Engines Introduction 



As per the new engine designations, the N54 will be officially referred to as the 
N54B3000. The “0” designates the “upper” output range and the “O’ indicates the first 
generation in this series. 

The N54 features the new HPI injection system which is capable of pressures of to 200 
bar. This system features the new “piezo” injector technology with “outward” opening 
injectors. 

Also, the N54 benefits from parallel bi-turbocharging with air to air intercoolers. 



Overall, the N54 provides the driver with uncompromising response and high torgue 
output in a package that is up to 150 pounds lighter than a V-8 engine. The new 
technology used in the N54, allows for maximum efficiency and the reguired low tailpipe 
emission figures to meet ULEVII guidelines.

N55 Engine Overview 



The N55 engine is the successor to the N54 engine and was introduced to the US mar¬ 
ket with the launch of the F07 535i Gran Turismo in the Spring of 2010. Technical 
updates and modifications make it possible to use only one exhaust turbocharger. The 
technical data has remained virtually the same - with reduced costs and improved quality. 

Innovations on the N55 engine: 

• Single exhaust turbocharger (twin scroll type) 

• Air-gap-insulated exhaust manifold six into two 

• Catalytic converter is located closer to engine 

• Direct fuel injection with central injector location, (uses solenoid valve injectors) 

• 3rd generation VALVETRONIC 

• Engine mounted Digital Engine Electronics (MEVD17.2 Bosch), integrated into 
intake system, FlexRay capability 

• Lightweight-construction crankshaft 

• Characteristic-map-regulated oil pump

Engine identification 

The engines are marked on the crankcase with an engine identification code for unigue 
identification. This engine identifier is also reguired for approval by the authorities. The 
N55 engine further develops this identification system and the code has been reduced 
from previously eight to seven characters. The engine serial number can be found under 
the engine identifier on the engine. Together with the engine identifier, this consecutive 
number enables unigue identification of each individual engine.

8 Cylinder Engine 


N63B44O0 Engine 

The N63 engine was introduced with the launched of the E71 xDrive50i in 2008. The 
new 4.4 liter, 400 hp, 450 Ib-ft torque V8 engine combines direct injection with twin tur¬ 
bochargers (neatly tucked into the engine valley). 

As the successor to the N62 engine, the N63B44O0 was developed based on the prin¬ 
ciples of "Efficient Dynamics". Efficient Dynamics combines driving enjoyment with effi¬ 
ciency which, in a new engine, is expressed in increased power output together with 
reduced fuel consumption. 



One of the ways of achieving this objective is through downsizing. This means the same 
power output is achieved with reduced engine displacement or higher power output at 
the same engine displacement. 

Both objectives apply to the N63 engine. Compared to the N62 engine, the power out¬ 
put has been boosted while decreasing the engine displacement. 

In comparison, the N62TU has a displacement of 4.8 liters, while the new N63 engine 
displaces only 4.4 liters. 

This is primarily achieved by technologies that already gave the N54 engine its leg¬ 
endary dynamics and outstanding efficiency: Bi-turbocharging in connection with high 
precision injection. 

The N63 is the first engine world-wide to feature an optimized package, involving the 
integration of the turbocharger and the main near-engine catalytic converters in the “v- 
space”. 

The N63 is installed in several current BMW models from the E71, E72, E70 LCI to F01, 
F02, F04, F07, FI 0 and FI 2.

BMW Engines Introduction 




Full Load Diagram 

Compared to it’s predecessor, the N62TU, the new N63 engine is characterized by dis¬ 
tinctly higher output. It has an impressive torgue curve which not only peaks earlier (at 
1750 RPM), but is also very “flat” which is a characteristic of BMW turbocharged 
engines.

Engine Overview 

The latest generation of BMW V-8 engines differs from past designs in several areas. 
Although all of these engines have been derived from the M60 engine from 1993, the 
N63 engine design is a departure from the original design. 

The following chart will point out some of the differences where the N63 is unique and 
distinct. The information found below outlines the new engine technology as compared 
to previously known systems. The features are organized by engine system and are 
divided into the following categories: 

• New Development - this is a system or component which has never been used pre¬ 
viously on a BMW engine. 

• New Design - this is a system or component which has been specifically developed 
for the N63 engine, but does not represent 

a technical innovation. 

• Technology carried over from N54 - This represents technology already known from 
the N54 engine and adapted to the N63.

The N74 engine was introduced to the US market with the launch of the F01/F02 
760i/760Li in the September 2009. 

The N74 engine is the successor to the N73 engine, but shares many technical features 
with the N63 engine. Thus the N74 engine also has high precision injection featuring 
outward-opening piezo injectors located centrally in the combustion chamber and twin 
turbochargers with indirect charge air cooling. On the N74 engine, however, the exhaust 
turbochargers are located on the outside of the engine.

Engine Overview 

The following provides an overview of the features of the N74 engine: 

• Engine block 

The main components of the engine block have been re-designed, although most 
features are already used on other BMW engines. 

• Crankshaft 

Although the Pistons and connecting rods have been borrowed from the N63 
engine, the crankshaft is a new design. 

• Valve train 

The VANOS units from the N63 engine are used and the camshafts are 
manufactured in the same way. The N74 does not use a VALVETRONIC system. 

• Camshaft 

The tooth-roller type chain of the N63 engine is used. Only the chain length and the 
layout of the timing gears have been adapted to suit the twelve-cylinder engine. 

• Belt drive 

The structure of the belt drive includes a “revolver” tensioning system and is identi¬ 
cal to that on the N63 engine. 

• Oil supply 

Though the oil supply system has been designed for the N74 engine, in principle, 
it's the same as that on the N63 engine. Consequently a volumetric-flow-controlled 
oil pump is also used here. 

• Crankcase ventilation 

The engine uses the same crankcase ventilation principle as N63 engine with a new 
feature called register ventilation. With this feature, the oil separators now have four 
cyclones per cylinder bank and in naturally-aspirated operation, ventilation only 
occurs via cylinder bank 2. 

• Cooling system 

Two separate cooling circuits are used as on N63, one to cool the engine and 
turbocharger bearings and one for charge air cooling, this latter circuit also provides 
cooling for the two engine control units. 


33 

BMW Engines Introduction 



• Air intake and exhaust system 

The air intake and exhaust systems are the same as that on the N63 engine. 

This means there are two conventional exhaust turbochargers with wastegate and 
blow-off valves. In contrast to the N63 engine, however, the exhaust turbochargers 
are located on the outside. 

• Secondary air system 

As with N73 engine, the N74 is equipped with a secondary air system. 

One new feature, however, are the two pressure sensors that monitor system 
operation. 

• Vacuum system 

The N74 engine has a two-stage vacuum pump as on the N63. The vacuum 
system only differs in that it has two vacuum reservoirs. 

• Fuel system 

The N74 engine uses “injection guided” (HPI) high precision injection in homoge¬ 
neous operation at all times, as on the N54 and N63 engines. The structure of the 
system is the same as that on the N63 engine. Consequently, the same injectors are 
used and the high pressure pumps are also very similar. 

• Engine electrical system 

A total of five control units were used on the N73 for engine control purposes. 

The N74 now has two engine control units, one of which has the role of the master 
(primary), the other the secondary. The two MSD87-12 control units are located to 
the left and right of the engine compartment and are cooled by the low temperature 
cooling circuit of the engine intercoolers. 


The N74 engine uses the most current BMW systems. Although the N74 engine has 
been designed from scratch, from a technology point of view it is, the same as the N63 
engine and has also borrowed many individual components from this engine.

Engine Identification 
Engine designation 

In the technical documentation, the engine designation is used to ensure the clear 
identification of engines. 

The N74 engine is available in the following version: N74B60U0 

In the technical documentation, you will also find the short form of the engine designation 
N74 which only permits identification of the engine type. 

The following chart explains the meaning of each component of the engine designation.

Engine identification and number 

To ensure clear identification and classification, the engines have an identification mark 
on the crankcase. This engine identification is also necessary for approval by the 
authorities. 

Decisive here are the first seven positions. The N74 engine has an engine identification 
that complies with the new standard, in which the first six positions are the same as the 
engine designation. The seventh position is a consecutive letter that can be used for 
various distinctions, e.g. power stage or exhaust emission standard. A general assignment 
is not possible, but an "A" usually means the basic model. 

The engine number is a consecutive number that permits unmistakable identification of 
each individual engine. The engine designation and number are on the crankcase behind 
the bracket for the air conditioning compressor.
