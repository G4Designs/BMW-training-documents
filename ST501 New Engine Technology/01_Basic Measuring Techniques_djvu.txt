Basic Engine Measurements 


During the course of engine repairs some basic engine measurements are required to 
verify engine diagnosis as well as to complete proper repairs. These measurements are 
made by precision measuring tools such as micrometers, Vernier calipers, cylinder bore 
gauges and dial indicators. 



Also, a working knowledge of the metric system is also a vital skill that is needed by the 
technician. All BMW engine measurements consist of metric specifications. Some of 
the routine engine measurements performed include: 

• Valve Guide Wear (Tilt Angle K) 

• Cylinder Bore Measurements (Taper and Out-of-Round) 

• Cylinder Head Warpage and Thickness 

• Axial and Radial Endplay Measurements (Crankshaft/Camshaft etc) 

Among all of the skills possessed by a modern technician, basic measuring techniques 
are perhaps the most overlooked and least used. This is why it is important to review 
these skills from time to time as a refresher. 

Also, it is necessary to access technical data to obtain the proper specifications for 
these measurements. This course is designed to review measuring techniques to 
assist in engine diagnosis.

Basic Measuring Techniques 





Vernier Measurement 


The Vernier scale is used on various measuring tools such as the Vernier caliper and the 
Depth Gauge. The Vernier scale can be used with Fractional (US) and Metric systems. 
For the purposes of this training module we will always refer to the Metric Vernier scale. 


The Vernier scale consists of a fixed scale and a sliding scale. The fixed scale is divided 
with graduations in 1 millimeter increments. The sliding scale has 10 graduations in 
increments of 0.5. 



In order to read a measurement, use the zero mark on the left end of the vernier scale to 
use as a guide to read a measurement on the fixed scale. 


In the example shown at the right, the zero 
mark is resting between 26 and 27 mm. 
Therefore the base measurement is 26 mm. 

Next, the decimal measurement must be 
taken. For this, find a line on the Vernier that 
most closely matches any line on the fixed 
scale. 

Using the example drawing, the “4” on the 
Vernier scale is lining up directly with a line on 
the fixed scale. 

Combining the previous reading with this 
reading, the result would be 26.4 mm. 



The designations on the Vernier scale are in increments of 0.5. For example, if a reading 
on the Vernier scale falls on the 0.5 (i.e. 2.5, 3.5 etc) designation this would indicate 
5/1 OOth’s of a millimeter.

Micrometer Measurements 

Another valuable measuring tool is the micrometer, which can be used for measure¬ 
ments such as bearing journal diameter, cylinder head thickness, valve shim thickness 
and brake rotor thickness etc. Micrometers also come in configurations for inside mea¬ 
surements as well. 

The micrometer scale comes in both fractional and metric varieties. We will cover only 
the metric micrometer scale in this course. 

First you must familiarize yourself with the construction of the micrometer in order to 
understand how measurements are made. 

Metric Micrometer Construction 

The micrometer is constructed of a few basic parts. The actual item to be measured is 
placed between the anvil and the spindle. The micrometer can be adjusted to the 
approximate size using the thimble. The thimble should only be used for the coarse 
adjustment. In order to make the actual measurement, the micrometer should only be 
turned using the ratchet (a.k.a. the friction stop). Do not attempt to make a measure¬ 
ment using the thimble. This will give an inaccurate measurement and ultimately dam¬ 
age the micrometer. 



Micrometers are available in various sizes for outside as well as inside measurements. 
The more common variation is the outside micrometer. They are usually available in 25 
millimeter increments such as 0-25 mm, 25-50 mm, 50-75 mm etc.. 


6 

Basic Measuring Techniques 



The metric micrometer can measure in increments of one hundredth of a millimeter 
(0.01 mm). One hundredth of a millimeter is equal to 0.0003937 inch which is less than 
one thousandth of an inch. 

The measurement area of the micrometer consists of the sleeve scale and the thimble 
scale. The sleeve scale is used to read whole and half millimeters. The thimble scale 
(which rotates) reads in hundredths (0.01) of a millimeter from zero to fifty. Two com¬ 
plete revolutions of the thimble equals one millimeter. 

On the sleeve scale, each scale mark above the center line indicates whole millimeters. 
Below the center line, half of a millimeter (or 0.5mm) increments are indicated. 



Using the example shown above, the micrometer is a 125-150mm micrometer. To read 
this micrometer, first take the basic reading from the sleeve scale. The thimble is past 
the 139 mm mark. Therefore the reading is a least 139 mm. Next, look at the thimble 
scale and note the reading on the centerline. The “10” on the thimble scale is lined up 
with the centerline. This indicates a reading of 0.10 mm. If you add the two readings; 
139 + .10 - 139.10 mm.

Dial Indicator Measurements 


The dial indicator is used to measure the travel or movement of a specific item. It can 
also be used to measure axial and radial runout. In engine measurement applications, 
the dial indicator can be used to measure valve guide wear, axial movement of the crank 
shaft (thrust), and runout of flywheels and harmonic balancers. 

First, it is important to familiarize yourself with Dial Indicator construction. The face of 
the dial indicator consists of a moveable bezel which is also attached to the large mea¬ 
suring scale. This allows the tool be brought to the “zero point” when needed. 


The main measuring device is the contact 
point. The contact point (1) is placed against 
the object to be measured. Usually, the con¬ 
tact point is rounded or has a ball bearing. 
This allows for a more accurate measure¬ 
ment. 

The measuring face of the dial indicator 
consists of 2 scales. The smaller scale is for 
the ‘coarse” measurement which is in gradua¬ 
tions of 1 millimeter. One revolution of the 
small scale is 10 millimeters. 

The large scale is in graduations of 0.01 mil¬ 
limeter and the scale goes from zero to one 
hundred. Therefore, one revolution of the 
large scale is one millimeter. 

The dial indicator also needs to be held in 
place when taking a measurement. This 
requires a stand or base. Depending upon 
the application, these stands can be a clamp 
type, magnetic or a threaded base. 

When taking a measurement, place the con¬ 
tact point on the object to be measured. The 
dial indicator must be pre-loaded slightly to 
prevent the measurement from bottoming 
out. 

When reading the scale, be sure to “zero” the 
dial indicator first. If the readings to be taken 
are less than 1 millimeter, you do not need to 
use the small scale. If the readings are larger 
than 1 millimeter, be sure to factor the small 
scale into your measurement.

Additional Engine Measurements 


During engine repair procedures it is sometimes necessary to assess engine wear to 
make determinations on parts replacement. Also, some engine measurements are 
needed to verify a previous diagnosis. 

For example, a cylinder leakdown test could indicate a cylinder sealing concern. Once 
the engine is disassembled, it would be necessary to verify this condition by checking 
the piston and piston ring condition. If OK, the next step would be to determine the 
condition of the cylinder bore. At this point, the cylinders should be checked for taper 
(conicity) and for out-of-round. The correct measurements could mean the difference 
between just replacing the rings and/or pistons or replacing the engine block. This is 
why it is necessary to make accurate measurements when needed. 

Some of the other routine engine measurements include: 

• Cylinder head warpage 

• Cylinder head thickness (on some applications) 

• Piston rings - end gap and axial clearance 

• Cylinder bore - including out-of-round and taper 

Cylinder Head Measurement 

If a repair reguires removal of the cylinder head, a few basic measurements can be 
performed to save time and unnecessary machine shop costs. If an engine has been 
overheated or has an internal or external fluid leakage (coolant/oil), it is a good idea to 
check the cylinder head for warpage. 

This can be done by using a commercially available machinists straight edge and a feel¬ 
er gauge. By sliding the feeler gauge under the straight edge in various locations, it can 
determine if there are any low spots or warpage. The specifications for warpage are 
found in ISTA under Technical Data. Usually, the specification is about 0.05 mm. 



12 

Basic Measuring Techniques 





Also, check to see if the cylinder head has a specification for machining limit. If so, it 
may be possible to have the cylinder head re-surfaced. Depending on the amount of 
material removed during the machining process, it may be necessary to install a thicker 
head 

gasket. There are some “service” head gaskets available through the part s department. 

The cylinder head can be checked for minimum thickness. This is done using a microm¬ 
eter or a vernier caliper. This is not possible on all engines, the example shown below is 
a 6-cylinder (M52TU/M54). 

If the minimum thickness is not met, the head will need to be replaced. 



13 

Basic Measuring Techniques 









Piston Measurements 

When replacing pistons and/or piston rings, there are some basic measurements that 
need to be made. When fitting a piston to a cylinder bore, the piston diameter should be 
checked to ensure a proper fit. 

The piston diameter is measured using a micrometer. The measurement is taken at a 
specified point (A) which is 90° from the piston pin axis. Each engine has a specific loca¬ 
tion to measure piston diameter. For example, the illustration below shows measuring 
Point A. The specification for this engine (N55) is 12 mm. So the piston diameter is 
measured 12 mm from the bottom of the piston skirt. 



The piston diameter, when subtracted from the cylinder bore eguals the cylinder wall to 
piston clearance. If the clearance measurement obtained is not correct, re-check your 
readings. 


14 

Basic Measuring Techniques 






Piston Ring Measurements 


There are some important specifications to 
check when installing piston rings. One of 
the measurements in axial clearance. Axial 
clearance is the distance between the 
piston ring and ring land. This prevents 
the rings from binding in the ring land at 
operating temperature. Axial clearance is 
measured using a feeler gauge. 

Also the piston ring end gap has to be 
checked. This measurement is checked 
using a feeler gauge. 

This clearance is critical in order to prevent 
the end gaps from contacting each other 
when the engine is at operating temp. 

When installing the piston rings, always 
stagger the end gaps as per the repair 
instructions. 




15 

Basic Measuring Techniques 





Cylinder Bore 

In order for the cylinder bore to be considered acceptable, it must not be excessively 
tapered or out-of-round. Once the cylinder has been checked for obvious damage and 
the surface finish is OK, the integrity of the bores must be verified. If cylinder wear is 
suspected, it must be checked using 
the proper cylinder bore gauge. 

Each cylinder must be checked at 
three position in the bore - top, mid¬ 
dle and bottom. Also there must be 
two opposing dimensions that should 
be checked. The difference between 
the top and bottom measurements 
will indicate the taper of the bore. 

The opposing dimensions will indi¬ 
cate the out-of-round specification. 

If these measurements are out of 
specification, the cylinder bore must 
be re-finished or overbored. New 
pistons and rings must be fitted as 
well. 

A dial bore gauge is a special purpose dial indicator for checking bores. The most accu¬ 
rate dial bore gauges have an accuracy of 0.0001 in., or 1 /10,000 in. 

The dial bore gauge consists of a dial indicator at one end of a long stalk and a tripod 
arrangement positioned 90° to the stalk at the other end. The tripod is made up of a sin¬ 
gle interchangeable post that goes against one side of the bore being checked and two 
hardened buttons at the other end that automatically center the plunger in the bore. The 
gauge plunger is between the two buttons, directly opposite the post. To allow for differ¬ 
ent bore sizes, the post is interchangeable. This allows you to measure the big end of a 
connecting rod or the diameter of a cylinder bore. 

Reading Technique 

To achieve a reading, the gauge is first zeroed. This is done by measuring across the 
gauge with an outside mike set to the specified bore size and rotating the dial face until 
0 aligns with the needle. The gauge is then inserted into the bore to the desired depth 
and rocked back and forth until the lowest reading is achieved. When the gauge is 
sguare to the bore and the indicator needle reverses direction, the lowest reading is 
read. This may be on the plus or minus side of the zero, indicating an oversize or under¬ 
size bore. Because it’s so fast and accurate, the dial bore gauge is most helpful while 
honing bores for fitting pistons. 



16 

Basic Measuring Techniques 




How to Use a Dial Bore Gauge 

Dial-bore gauges (DB) or dial indicators, when used in conjunction with a micrometer, 
can give very accurate and precise inside measurements. Used for holes of at least two 
inches in diameter, they consist of a base that houses an interchangeable anvil that sets 
the range of the measurement and a small sliding stud that when compressed will give a 
reading on the gauge or dial portion of the tool. The dial will have a rotating bezel that is 
rotated to "zero' the gauge at the target measurement, which is set by a separate 
micrometer. Dial-bore gauges are useful in checking for taper or out-of-round conditions 
in a cylinder bore as well as many other inside machinists measurements. 

Things you’ll need: 

• Dial bore indicator set 

• Micrometer (of the desired range) 

• Machinist's rule 

Setup 

1. Determine the rough opening with a machinist's rule. Lay the rule across the top of 
the bore and dress the zero end of the rule to one edge of the hole. Orient the rule so 
that the point measured is 180° away from the zero end. Slide the clip down the rule 
to mark the edge of the hole and record the measurement. 

2. Select and install the appropriate anvil. The anvil should be long enough to contact the 
side of the bore and slightly compress the stud when inserted into the hole. Do not 
use an oversized anvil and try to force the indicator, as this will likely destroy the accu¬ 
racy of the tool. 

3. Select a micrometer in the appropriate range. Most cylinder bores will be in the two- 
to-three-inch or three-to-four-inch range. Set the micrometer for the target measure¬ 
ment or for an arbitrary measurement. The arbitrary measurement should be close to 
the target measurement and be an even number that will be easy to do guick math on 
to arrive at the actual measurement. Record this number on paper with room to do 
simple addition problems. 

4. Insert the anvil and stud between the micrometers machined surfaces. Rotate the 
bezel until the "zero" is in line with the needle position. The DB indicator is now ready 
to read a measurement relative to the setting. 


17 

Basic Measuring Techniques 


Using the Dial Indicator 

5. Insert the base of the indicator into the hole. Ensure that the two contact points are 

180° from each other and that neither the anvil nor the stud is hanging on scoring or 
the cross-hatch pattern of the bore wall. 

6. Hold the indicator as near to vertical as possible and gently and slightly rock the DB 
indicator along the anvil/stud axis. The needle will swing clockwise as the tool comes 
to vertical and the anvil/stud come to their proper position. Read the number on the 
dial at the point where the needle stops rotating clockwise and attempts to start back¬ 
ing down in a counter-clockwise direction. This is the "relative" measurement. The 
number may be a positive or a negative. Record this number and remove the DB indi¬ 
cator from the hole. 

7. Add or subtract the positive or negative number, respectively, from your target or arbi¬ 
trary number. This final adjusted number is the actual measurement of the hole. 


Tips & Warnings 

• Clean the hole to be measured and ensure that it is free of oil, grease or particles 
before introducing a precision measuring tool into the hole. 

• Never force precision measuring tools. Permanent and expensive. 


18 

Basic Measuring Techniques 



Plastigage 

Plastigage is used to measure oil clearances on crankshaft main, connecting rod and 
camshaft journals. 

All parts should be free from grease and oil in order to get an accurate measurement. 
The first step is to assemble the journal and cap with new bearing inserts installed. 
Make sure all bearing caps are installed properly based on the factory makings. 


The next step is to torgue all cap bolts to specification. Then loosen the bolts 
of the bearing cap that you want to check clearance on and remove the cap. 



Using a clean, lint free shop cloth wipe any oil off of the surfaces you want to clearance. 
Cut a piece of Plastigage and remove it from the package. Place the Plastigage across 
the surface of the journal (in line with the shaft). Install the bearing cap over the 
Plastigage and torgue the cap bolts to factory specification. 



19 

Basic Measuring Techniques 





Remove the bolts and the bearing cap once again. You will see the crushed Plastigage 
on the surface of the journal and bearing insert. Using the scale printed on the side of 
the wrapper measure the crushed Plastigage imprint. 



Compare your measurement to the oil clearance specification; if it is within range pro¬ 
ceed with assembly. If the measurement falls between two sizes then you can estimate 
what the size in between is.

Units of Measure 


Metric System 

All BMW specifications are metric. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of those areas on 
the metric system which apply to BMW vehicles is vital to a BMW Service Technician. 

The unit of length, and the basis for all other metric units of measurement is the meter. 
The meter (1 meter), as a point of reference, is slightly longer that a yard (39.37 inches). 

The divisions of a meter are hundredths and thousandths. One hundredth of a meter is 
called a centimeter, and is egual to 0.3937 inch or about half the diameter of a nickel. 

One thousandth of a meter is called a millimeter. The small marks between the cen¬ 
timeter increments are each one millimeter, or one tenth of a centimeter. And as a 
point of reference, a standard paper clip is about one millimeter thick. 

Metric System Denominations 

Throughout the metric system, common to all units of measurement, are prefixes which 
designate multiples or fractions of the unit. 

For automotive applications, the most common prefixes are centi; designating one-hun¬ 
dredth; milli; for one thousandth and kilo- for one thousand. 

There are letters uniformly used throughout the system to label the divisions or multi¬ 
ples of each unit of measurement. The letter “m” represents milli, “c’ is for centi and “k” 
is for kilo. These are then combined with the letter representing the unit of measure¬ 
ment. 

For example, mm is millimeter, cm is centimeter and km is kilometer. The same applies 
to liter which is the unit of volume and gram which is the unit of weight. 

One kilogram is egual to one thousand grams which is egual to 2.2 pounds. 

All metric measurements are directly related. For example, one thousand cubic cen¬ 
timeters, or 10cm x 10cm x 10cm of water weighs one kilogram. The volume of those 
one thousand cc’s is one liter.
