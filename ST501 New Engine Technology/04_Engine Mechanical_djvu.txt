Engine Construction 


Innovative Solutions 

The N52 engine concept allowed for a substantial weight savings of 10Kg (22 lbs.) over 
its predecessor the M54. The primary contributors to the total weight savings are the 
use of an innovative composite magnesium-aluminum crankcase and a lightweight 
exhaust manifold. The magnesium bedplate and cylinder head cover also played a sig¬ 
nificant role in overall weight reduction. 

The overall lightweight engine package allows for and improved power to weight ratio as 
well as an improvement in fuel consumption. 

Crankcase 

Since magnesium cannot be used in all areas of engine construction, the N52 crankcase 
is a composite design. The crankcase consists of an aluminum/silicon insert which is 
cast inseparably in a magnesium alloy. 

The crankcase is a two piece design with a separate bedplate also cast from magne¬ 
sium. An additional design change from previous designs is the timing cover which is 
now cast as an integral part of the engine block. 

The aluminum silicon insert provides the threaded connections for the transmission 
mounting, cylinder head and crankshaft main bolts. The insert provides the coolant 
passages as well. This is to prevent coolant contact with the magnesium portion of the 
engine block.

Magnesium - New Material in Engine Construction 

Until now, magnesium has not been explored as an option for a material for engine 
construction. Recently, the realization is that the weight savings potential of aluminum 
has been exploited to its fullest. This is one of the primary factors in the decision to use 
magnesium as engine building material. The light weight and low density of magnesium 
make it an outstanding option to aluminum. 

Magnesium, which has very good casting properties, makes it possible to manufacture 
large components with high surface quality. Despite the high accuracy of the cast parts, 
subsequent machining of function areas is, however, in the majority of cases unavoidable. 

These excellent properties are, however, offset by several problematic aspects in the use 
of magnesium and its alloys. The former serious problem of corrosion has in the mean¬ 
time been substantially alleviated by the development of distinctly more corrosion resis¬ 
tant alloys. The alloy used for the N52 is designated AJ62. 

Nevertheless, a distinct corrosion risk still exists if the material-specific fundamentals 
described in the following are disregarded. Non-approved materials that come in contact 
with magnesium must not be installed. 

This means only genuine BMW spare parts must be installed. The materials of the 
add-on parts must either be compatible with AJ62 or shielded by a seal/gasket from the 
magnesium casing. For these reasons, it is important to strictly adhere to the corre¬ 
sponding information provided in the repair instructions. 

Electrochemical Properties of Magnesium 

Metals are divided into noble (precious) and 
base metals. Gold, for example, is a noble 
metal and sodium a very base metal. The 
other metals are distributed over this divi¬ 
sion. When two metals such as iron and 
magnesium get in contact with each other 
and are placed in an electrically conductive 
liquid, e.g. a salt solution, the base metal will 
break down or dissolve and go into 
solution. 

At the same time, electric current flows from 
the noble metal to the base metal. Under 
certain conditions, the base metal will 
deposit itself on the noble metal.

Bolts 


As with the N52, the N54 continues to use the aluminum bolts for most fastening duties. 
Even though the N54 is an all aluminum crankcase, the aluminum bolts are used to 
reduce any confusion. This decreases the possibility of any incorrectly installed bolts of 
the wrong material (steel vs. aluminum). Of course, the N52KP and N51 still retains the 
use of aluminum bolts as well. 



The same rules apply to the handling and installation of aluminum bolts as in the past. 
Strict adherence to repair instructions is required to ensure proper connections. 



Be sure to use the proper torque/tightening angle sequence 
as indicated in the “tightening torques” section of TIS. 



6 

Engine Mechanical 













The use of magnesium is a new concept for pro¬ 
duction passenger vehicles. BMW has developed 
special processes for the development of the N52 
crankcase. A special magnesium alloy (AJ62) is 
used which has excellent properties which reduce 
the possibility of corrosion and allow favorable 
machining characteristics. 

The cylinder bore consists of an Alusil structure, 
there are no iron cylinder liners as with previous 6 
cylinder designs. The cylinder bores cannot be 
machined, however this design still allows for plan¬ 
ing of the deck surface if needed. 



Bedplate 

The N52 engine uses a split crankcase, the upper section is made from a composite 
magnesium/aluminum structure. The lower portion, which is used to increase rigidity, 
is designed as a bedplate structure made from magnesium. 

There are sintered steel inlays (arrow) for the main bearings to take up forces which would 
not be suitable for magnesium alone. 

Between the bedplate and crankcase, a liquid sealer is injected under high pressure into 
a machined groove. This process is critical in service applications. 



7 

Engine Mechanical 
























Of the three new 6-cylinder engines introduced in 2007, the N54 has the most changes 
in comparison with the N52. Beginning with the crankcase, the N54 engine uses an all 
aluminum alloy block with cast cylinder liners. The aluminum crankcase is pressure cast 
and differs from the “insert” design of the N52. This design is in contrast to the previous 
composite magnesium/aluminum crankcase on the N52. The construction of the N54 
crankcase is to accommodate the increased torque output of the turbocharged N54. 


All aluminum (AL226 alloy) crankcase - N54 



\ 


Dimensionally, the N54 crankcase is the same as the N52 and continues to use the 
2-piece crankcase with bedplate. There are some slight differences regarding the bolt 
pattern for the transmission mounting. This requires a new engine mounting bracket 
when installing on to the engine stand. 


8 

Engine Mechanical 


Gaskets and Seals 


The gasket design on the new engines is mostly similar to the N52. The N54 uses a 
specific head gasket for use with the turbocharged application. The head gasket is a 
multi-layered design which does not have the protruding lip as on the N52. This lip is not 
needed due to the fact that the cylinder head is aluminum and contact corrosion is not an 
issue. 

The split crankcase still uses the injected sealant carried over from the N52. 

Piston and Connecting Rods 

As with the cylinder head, the piston designs differ between engines. Special pistons are 
used for compatibility with the direct injection system. The piston crown is 
modified to meet the mixture formation and higher compression requirements. 

As in the past, the underside of the pistons are cooled with oil spray jets. 

The N51 engine uses a lower compression ratio and accordingly uses a different piston 
design. The N52KP uses the same design as the N52 engine. 

The connecting rods on all of the NG engines have been stiffened with a thicker beam on 
the rod. This design has also been in production since the N52 (6/06). 

The connecting rods are weight optimized 
by tapering the “small end” of the rod. 

This method reduces weight without 
reducing strength. 

The “big end” of the connecting rod is 
“cracked” to create to proper centering of 
the bearing cap without the use of dowel 
pins. This further contributes to the overall 
weight reduction. Each connecting rod 
uses pairing codes (1) to allow the correct 
rod cap to be matched to the connecting 
rod. 

The connecting rods are divided into 
weight categories and can only be replaced as a set. 

Crankshafts 

While a cast iron crankshaft is used in the N52KFJ N51 and N55. The N54, N63 and 
N74 all use a forged steel crankshaft. 

To reduce weight, the main bearings diameter of the crankshaft have been reduced and 
contain an integrated sprocket for the oil pump. See the specific engine training material 
for further details.

Differential Intake Air Control (DISA) N52 

The torque developed in an engine greatly depends on the 
quality of the fresh gas charge during the induction stroke. 

Oscillations are induced in the intake air mass during the 
induction strokes of the individual cylinders, i.e. by the down¬ 
ward movement of the pistons. These oscillations are in turn 
superimposed by oscillations that arise from pressure peaks as 
soon as the moved air mass of an intake cylinder comes up 
against the closing intake valves. 

When two oscillations are superimposed, the resulting oscillation is known as the 
resonance oscillation or sympathetic vibration. The resonance can be an amplification 
or an attenuation of the initial oscillation or vibration. 

Whether a pressure peak or a pressure hole is applied before the intake valves at the 
cylinder at the start of the induction stroke depends on the path the superimposed oscil¬ 
lations have covered in the intake area and on the engine speed, i.e. the gas speed. 

The desire for high torque over a broad engine speed range necessitates an increasingly 
diverse range of air intake systems for internal combustion engines. The geometry and 
control of the intake manifold therefore have a considerable influence on the quality of the 
charge cycle. An intake manifold with a fixed length would provide an optimum cylinder 
charge only at a certain engine speed. 

The options of boosting torque over a defined engine speed window are limited. Since 
the N52 reaches a maximum engine speed of 7,000 rpm, the previous 2-stage DISA in 
the M54 would produce a torque lag in the mid engine speed range. The N52 is thus 
equipped with a 3-stage DISA in order to provide high torque also in the medium engine 
speed range. 

The result of these three stages is illustrated in the diagram below. The switched stages 
of the DISA achieve a high torque over the entire engine speed range. This principle is 
realized by means of an intake manifold changeover facility with two DISA actuators and 
an overflow pipe in the intake area. 

In contrast to the previous system that was controlled with vacuum, 
the two DISA actuators are now operated by electric motors.

Cylinder Head Cover 


The cylinder head cover of the N52 is cast from 
magnesium alloy. The cylinder head cover 
provides an important mounting point for the 
WT motor. All of the bolts which attach the 
cylinder head cover to the cylinder head are 
made from aluminum. 

When performing repairs which involve the 
removal of the cylinder head cover be sure to 
replace the bolts and use the proper 
torgue/angle procedure as outlined in the 
repair instructions. 

N52 Cylinder head cover 

While the N52 uses a magnesium cylinder head 
cover, the newer engines 6 cylinder engines use 
a plastic cover. The N52KP and N51 use the 
same basic design to accommodate the WT 
motor and new crankcase ventilation system. 

In comparison, the N54 uses a completely 
different design. This is due to the lack of 
VALVETRONIC and the modified crankcase 
ventilation system. 

The cylinder head cover of the N55 is a new 
development. The accumulator for the vacuum 

system, all crankcase ventilation components N54 Cylinder head cover 
and the blow-by channels are integrated into the 
cylinder head cover.

Cylinder Head 

As far as cylinder head designs are concerned, all four of the 6-cylinder engines use a 
different cylinder head. While all of the heads are made from aluminum, they differ due to 
the design requirements. For example, the N54 does not use VALVETRONIC and 
requires accommodation for the fuel injectors for direct injection. The N52KP engine 
uses a cylinder head which is mostly identical to the N52. The N51, which is a SULEV II 
design, uses a lower compression ratio and therefore a different cylinder head with a 
modified combustion chamber. Finally, the N55 uses VALVETRONIC III instead ofVVT II 
with HDE injection. 

Cross-section of N54 Cylinder Head 



The N54 cylinder head features the injector and spark plugs arranged in the center of the 
combustion chamber surrounded by the intake and exhaust valves. This arrangement is 
typical of a direct injection engine and has been implemented into most current BMW 
engines cylinder head designs. Engines that use this design are the N54, N55, N63, S63 
and N74. 


Please refer to the individual engine training information or repair 
instructions for further information.

Engine Mechanical 











Valvetrain 

With regard to the valvetrain changes, the intake valves still use the 5mm stem from 
the N52. However, the exhaust valves have been upgraded to a 6mm valve stem for 
increased durability. The 6mm exhaust stem has also been in production on the current 
N52 since 3/06. 

Although most current BMW engines have solid construction valves the N55 exhaust 
valve stems are hollow, filled with sodium and are 6mm in diameter. In addition, the valve 
seat of the exhaust valves are reinforced. 


Camshafts 

Recent advancements in engine technolo¬ 
gy have brought about new camshaft 
designs. Most engine variants take advan¬ 
tage of the lightweight, hydroformed 
camshafts from the N52. The lightweight 
camshafts are manufactured in an internal 
high pressure forming process called 
hydroforming. 

Only lightweight hydroformed camshafts are used on the N55 engine. The exhaust 
camshaft features bearing races and is encapsulated in a camshaft housing. 

The camshaft housing reduces oil foaming during operation. 

The N63 and N74 engines have assembled camshafts, of the type as used on the 
M73 engine. These camshafts are assembled from individual components rather than 
machined from a solid cast iron blank. All components are shrink-fitted on to the shaft. 
This technology not only provides a reduction in manufacturing costs, but also a consid¬ 
erable weight savings. 

Note: For supply and production reasons, it is possible that lightweight hydro- 
formed camshafts as well as cast camshafts or a mixture of both were 
installed in N51, N52 and N54 engines.

VANOS 


All current BMW engines use the infinitely variable double VANOS system which was 
first introduced on the M52B20TU engine. The design is similar to that of two-setting 
intake VANOS; the main difference is that in addition to the timing of the intake camshaft, 
the timing of the exhaust camshaft can also be varied. The system allows for infinite varia¬ 
tion of timing of both camshafts according to the control commands from the engine 
management ECU. 

The advantages of infinitely variable double VANOS are: 

• Higher torque at low and medium engine speeds. 

• Smaller quantity of residual exhaust when idling due to smaller valve overlap resulting 
in improved idling. 

• Internal exhaust recirculation in the medium power band in order to reduce nitrogen 
oxide emissions. 

• Faster warm-up of catalytic converters and lower raw emission levels after a cold start. 

• Reduction of fuel consumption. 

The possible adjustment range of the double VANOS system is clearly identifiable by the 
blue/red shaded areas 

The infinitely variable double VANOS system is used on all current engines. The main, 
and sometimes only, change to the system is that each engine uses different spread 
ranges (check engine specifications for the individual cam spread). 

As with the previous systems, the VANOS units should not be mixed 
up as the spread ranges for the intake and exhaust are different and 
engine damage could result.

Engine Mechanical 







































































































The infinitely variable double VANOS system of the N52 uses hydraulic oscillating motor 
type VANOS units for the intake and the exhaust cams. Although they have identical func¬ 
tion, the oscillating motor VANOS units are a further development of the variable vane 
type motor VANOS units used on previous systems. They are designed as an integrated 
component in the chain drive and are mounted with a central bolt on the respective 
camshaft. When de-pressurized, a coil spring holds the VANOS unit in the base position.

The VANOS units are controlled by oil pressure from the 4/3 proportional solenoid valves. 
The valves are located in the front of the cylinder head and are controlled by the ECM. 
The ECM regulates the VANOS based on factors such as engine RPM, load and coolant 
temperature.

The oil circulation for the VANOS system passes from the sump (1) to the oil pump (2) 
into the oil filter (3) and from there separately for the intake and exhaust camshafts 
through a non-return valve (5) fitted between the cylinder head and the crankcase, into a 
fine filter (6) on the solenoid valve, and into the solenoid valve (9). The solenoid valves 
direct the flow of oil so as to apply pressure to either one side or other of the pressure 
chamber in relevant hydraulic vane motor (10 or 11). 

The position of the intake and exhaust camshafts is adjusted by a hydraulic vane motor 
on each camshaft. 

The two seals between camshaft and camshaft bearing are required to ensure a reliable 
supply of oil. The solenoid valves are attached to the cylinder head by mounting brackets. 
The mounting brackets must not be bent; observe repair instructions. The adjustment 
time for 60 ° of crankshaft rotation is approx. 300 ms. 

That figure is true of all VANOS systems with hydraulic vane motor or oscillating motor.

Engine Mechanical 

















































Volume Controlled Oil Pump 

The high oil volume demands of the VANOS system creates a need for an oil pump that 
can deliver a high volume of oil when needed. Also, the pump needs to be able to cut 
back on the oil delivery volume when the requirements are not as great. 

This occurs when the VANOS is not as active, for instance during cruise situations. 

This oil pump is a “volume controlled” design which not only meets the oiling require¬ 
ments, but also contributes to improved fuel economy and emissions. 

The advantages of a volumetric-flow controlled oil pump: 

• Favorable space/efficiency ratio 

• Provides sufficient hydraulic pressure and volume for valve control systems 

• Reduced volumetric flow fluctuations 

• Hydraulic energy not converted into thermal loss 

• Reduction of premature oil aggiing 

• Reduced sound emissions

Engine Mechanical 


















The N52 engine was the first to be equipped with a volumetric-flow controlled oil pump. 
This type of pump delivers only as much oil as is necessary under the respective engine 
operating conditions. The pump minimizes the oil flow delivered in low load operating 
ranges. This reduces the fuel consumption of the engine and slows down the oil wear 
rate. 

The pump is designed as a slide valve-type vane pump. In delivery mode, the pump 
shaft is positioned off-center in the housing and the vanes are displaced radially during 
rotation. As a result, the vanes form chambers of differing volume. The oil is drawn in as 
the volume increases and, conversely, expelled into the oil channels as the volume 
decreases. 

Control Piston with Pendulum Support 



Oil Pump Operation 

The crankshaft drives the oil pump with a chain. The applied oil pressure acts on the 
control piston/pendulum support against the force of a compression spring. The pendu¬ 
lum support varies the position of the slide valve according to the applied oil pressure. 
When the pump shaft is positioned towards the center of the slide valve the changes in 
volume are small and the delivered volume is low. When the pump shaft is located off 
center, the changes in volume and the delivered quantity are greater. If the oil required by 
the engine increases, for example during VANOS control intervention, the pressure in the 
lubricating system drops therefore it is also reduced at the control spool. In response, the 
pump increases the delivery volume and re-establishes the pressure conditions. When 
the oil required by the engine decreases, the pump correspondingly reduces the delivery 
quantity towards the zero-delivery direction. 

The oil pump used in the N55 engine is a further development of the shuttle slide valve 
volume control oil pump. The activation of the oil pump is adapted by the engine man¬ 
agement and controlled through an oil pressure control valve. See the N55 engine train¬ 
ing material for more information.

VALVETRONIC II 


With the introduction of the N52, the 6-cylinder engine is now also equipped with the 
load control system based on the valve timing gear. The VALVETRONIC I system that 
was used on the 8-cylinder and 12-cylinder engines already achieved a substantial 
increase in efficiency. BMW has further developed this concept with the VALVETRONIC II. 



The results of this further development are: 

• Increased engine dynamics. 

• Increased efficiency. 

• Improved emission values. 

These results underscore BMW-specific standards. This engine that features 
the following optimizations further enhances the Ultimate Driving Machine. 

• The top engine speed has been increased to 7,000 rpm. 

• The specific power output has been increased to 63.4 kW/l (85 hp/liter). 

• The specific engine torque is 100 Nm/I over a broad engine speed range. 

• Distinctly increased valve acceleration values and friction-optimized transmission 
elements result in an even more responsive engine. 

• C02 emissions reduced. 

• Compliance with the world's most stringent exhaust emission regulations. 


20 

Engine Mechanical 







Design/Function 

The VALVETRONIC II consists of the fully variable valve lift control combined with the 
variable camshaft control (double VANOS). The valve lift is controlled only on the intake 
side while the camshaft is adjusted also on the exhaust side. 

The throttle-free load control is implemented by variable valve lift of the intake valve, 
variable valve opening timing of the intake valve and variable camshaft spread of the 
intake and exhaust camshaft. 

In terms of this load control principle, VALVETRONIC II corresponds to the 
VALVETRONIC I introduced on the N62 engine. (See the N52 training material for more 
information) 

System optimization includes modification of the valve gear kinematics, a modified 
actuator motor and the adapted spread range of the VANOS units. 

The main differences are: 

• The plain bearing on the intermediate lever to the eccentric shaft has been replaced 
by a roller bearing, thus reducing the friction in the valve timing gear. 

• Guidance of the intermediate lever is more precise. Only one spring is now required 
to guide and hold the intermediate lever. 

• The moved mass of the valve timing gear has been reduced by 13%. 

• The lift range of the intake valves has been improved. The maximum lift has been 
increased to 9.9 mm but more importantly the minimum lift has been further 
reduced to 0.18 mm. 

The overall result is supported by further improvements in the intake manifold and 
exhaust dynamics.

In the minimum valve lift position, the eccentric-shaft stop (1) is in contact with the cylin¬ 
der-head stop (2) which is screwed into the cylinder head. That way, the minimum valve 
lift is mechanically limited.

Explanation

The maximum valve lift is also limited by a mechanical stop as can be seen from the 
following illustration. 


A stop routine can be implemented between the 
mechanical stops in order to detect the positions 
of the mechanical stops. For this purpose, the 
eccentric shaft is adjusted from zero lift to full lift. 
The stop routine is executed only when the 
motor electronics determines implausible values 
during the engine start procedure. The stop rou¬ 
tine can also be initiated by the diagnosis sys¬ 
tems. 




VALVETRONICII is used on N52 and N51. 

VALVETRONIC III was introduced with the N55 where it is combined 
with double VANOS, Direct Injection and Turbocharging (TVDI). 
Refer to the N55 training material for more information. 


22 

Engine Mechanical 
























Phasing 

Because VALVETRONIC II, is a very fast and precise torque control system a “Phasing” 
procedure is implemented to assist adjustment in the lower valve lift range. Both of the 
intake valves of a cylinder open together up to a lift of 0.2 mm. Past that point Valve 1 
begins to lead (advance) Valve 2 which opens with a slight delay relative to Valve 1. Valve 
2 catches up to Valve 1 again at a lift of approx. 6 mm. From there on, they open together 
again. The phasing is made possible by a slight variation in the profiles of the two cams 
on the eccentric shaft of a cylinder. 


This opening characteristic has a favorable effect on the inflow of gasses into the cylinder. 
By keeping the opening cross section of the intake valves small a distinctly higher flow 
rate at a constant intake volume is achieved. In connection with the geometry in the 
upper area of the combustion chamber, this higher flow rate is used to mix the air/fuel 
mixture more effectively.

The N52KP and N51 retain the already proven VALVETRONIC system with an optimized 
WT motor as of 2007. 


Initially turbocharged engines did NOT use VALVETRONIC, as is the case of N54, N63 
and N74. This is due to the fact that the VALVETRONIC system is designed to reduce 
pumping losses. It improves volumetric efficiency by optimizing the air charge. A tur¬ 
bocharger system is also designed to increase volumetric efficiency by reducing pumping 
losses. Therefore, there was no need for both of these systems to be employed on the 
same engine. However with the introduction of the N55 engine turbocharging, direct 
injection and double VANOS were combined for the first time with the third generation 
VALVETRONIC system (TVDI) to enhance even further the efficiency of the engine with¬ 
out sacrificing performance. 



See the N55 training material or the Engine Technology 
section for more information.

Engine Mechanical 












































Vacuum Pump 

As with the N62 engine, the N52 has little vacuum available in the intake manifold to 
operate certain components due in part to the use of the VALVETRONIC system. 

The vacuum pump supplies vacuum to the brake booster and the exhaust flap damper 
and wastegate valve (on turbocharged engines). Thanks to the vacuum pump the 
exhaust flap damper system no longer requires a vacuum storage reservoir because its 
operation is no longer affected by variations in intake manifold vacuum. 

Although the vacuum pump of N52/N51 is single stage, the vacuum pump used on later 
engines (N54, N55, N63 and N74) is designed as a two-stage pump and therefore has 
two connections. The first stage is for the brake booster and the second for the sec¬ 
ondary loads. 

The N51, N52, N54 and N55 engines use a vacuum pump driven by the timing chain 
drive.The N63 drives the vacuum pump via the rear of the intake cam while the N74 dri¬ 
ves it via the front of the exhaust cam.

Engine Mechanical 










There are two basic methods for ventilating the crankcase which have been in used by 
BMW engines. One of the methods uses a crankcase ventilation valve and the other 
does not. In either case, the crankcase vapors must be metered into the intake and the 
oil must be separated from the vapors. 

The basic crankcase ventilation system is shown below. It features the “labyrinth” 
method of oil separation which uses a maze of channels to divide the crankcase vapor 
from the liquid oil. The vapors can enter the engine through a “calibrated” orifice, while to 
liquid oil returns back into the engine or oil sump. 



The N52KP and N51 engines use a crankcase ventilation valve and the “labyrinth” 
method of oil separation. 

The N54 engine does not use a crankcase ventilation valve and oil is separated using the 
“cyclonic method” of the cyclone separators. 

The crankcase ventilation systems on turbocharged engines operate in two modes. One 
mode is for turbocharged operation (Boost mode) and the other is for “naturally aspirated 
mode” (under low load and deceleration). 

The N63 and N74 engine crankcase ventilation operate in accordance with the same 
principle as on the N54 engine with some differences. In the case of the N63 engine, 
each cylinder bank has its own crankcase breather. 

The N55 uses a different design principle from all previous engines. The operation is 
described in detail in the N55 training material.

N54 Crankcase Ventilation 

The crankcase ventilation system of the N54 engine is unique due to the fact that this is a 
turbocharged engine. This means the intake manifold pressure will be higher than that of 
a naturally aspirated engine. This presents new challenges regarding the design of the 
crankcase ventilation system. 

The basic description of the system is as follows: 

• The system uses a calibrated orifice to meter crankcase vapors into the engine. 

• Liquid oil is separated from the crankcase vapors is done by “cyclonic” action. 

• There are 2 channels for crankcase vapors depending upon the manifold pressure. 

• Most of the system components are integrated into the cylinder head cover. 

One of the most important features is the fact that most of the system components are 
integrated into the plastic cylinder head cover. This allows engine heat to warm the 
crankcase vapors which prevents any potential freezing of any water vapor trapped in the 
system. In contrast to the N52, there is only one heating element located at the intake 
manifold inlet. 

Cyclone Separator 

A cyclone oil separator is used in the N54 engine. Here, four of the described cyclones 
are integrated into the oil-separator housing. The oil mist drawn in from the crankcase is 
set into a spinning motion in the cyclone. As a result of the centrifugal forces, the heavier 
oil settles on the cyclone walls and from there drips into the oil drain. 

The lighter blow-by gases are sucked out from the middle of the cyclone. The purified 
blow-by gases are then fed to the air-intake system.

Crankcase Ventilation System Function 

The crankcase ventilation system of the N54 must be capable of venting the crankcase 
during two different modes of engine operation. When the engine is in deceleration, the 
intake manifold pressure is low (high vacuum). During acceleration or idling, the intake 
manifold pressure is higher (low vacuum). Therefore the system operates differently in 
these modes. This is what is unigue about the crankcase venting system on the N54.

Operation with Low Manifold Pressure 

When the engine has low manifold pressure such as in decel, the crankcase vapors are 
routed through a channel (15) between the cylinder head cover and intake manifold. The 
liquid oil is separated before the channel in the cyclonic separators (3) in the cylinder 
head cover. The liquid oil returns to the engine via the oil discharge valve (4). 

The channel contains a pressure restrictor (16) which regulates the flow of crankcase 
vapors. During deceleration, the crankcase vapors (E) are directed via a check valve (14) 
which is located in the cylinder head cover. The check valve is opened when low 
pressure is present in the intake manifold (throttle closed). 

Also, a PTC heater has been integrated into the intake manifold inlet. The inlet pipe is 
connected to the channel (15) and prevent any moisture from freezing at the inlet.

Operation with High Manifold Pressure 

When in turbocharged mode, the pressure in the intake manifold increases and then 
closes the check valve (14). Now, a low pressure is present in the charge air suction line 
(10). This causes a low pressure in the hose (11) leading to the manifold check valve 
(12). The crankcase vapors (after separation) are directed through the check valve (12) 
into the charge air suction line (10) and ultimately back into the engine. The check valve 
(12) also prevent boost pressure from entering the crankcase when the intake manifold 
pressure is high.

Be aware that any check valve failure could cause excessive oil con¬ 
sumption possibly accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust. 
This should not be mistaken for a failed turbocharger. Always per¬ 
form a complete diagnosis of the crankcase ventilation system, 
before replacing any turbocharger or associated components. 

Crankcase Ventilation N52KP and N51 

The crankcase ventilation system on the N52KP and N51 uses a crankcase ventilation 
valve which is incorporated into the cylinder head cover. Oil is separated via an internal 
labyrinth which is also incorporated into the cylinder head cover. 

This system, like the N54, also benefits from the integral components. This design 
allows engine heat to warm the crankcase vapors which decreases the likelihood of any 
moisture freezing in the system during conditions of low ambient temperature. 

Note: For further information regarding the crankcase ventilation system of a 
specific engine please refer to the appropriate training information (on 
ICP) or repair instruction (in ISTA).

Cooling System 


The engine cooling system undertakes the classic task of carrying heat away from the 
engine and maintaining a defined operating temperature as constant as possible. The 
addition of turbocharging also requires cooling of the turbo/turbos. 

The cooling system of the N54 engine consists of a radiator circuit and an isolated oil 
cooling circuit. The fact that there is an isolated oil-cooling circuit ensures that heat is 
not introduced via the engine oil into the engine's coolant system. 

The use of an Electric Water Pump (EWP) allows the engine and turbo to be cooled 
even when the engine is off (N52, N51, N54 and N55). See the N54 system on the next 
page. 

The N63 and N74 engines feature conventional coolant pumps that are driven by the 
belt drive. This pump cannot be used to continue cooling the turbochargers after the 
engine has been shut down. In this case an auxiliary pump is used. 

N54 Cooling System Overview 

The structure of the coolant circuit of the N54 is the same as that of the N52 engine. 
The engine is flushed through with coolant in accordance with the cross-flow concept. 
Cooling output can be influenced as a function of load by activating the following com¬ 
ponents: 

• Electric fan 

• Electric coolant pump 

• Map thermostat 

It is also possible in an N54 engine in conjunction with an automatic gearbox to utilize 
the lower area of the radiator to cool the gearbox by means of the gearbox-oil cooler. 

This is achieved as in the N52 engine with control sleeves, which are introduced into the 
radiator tank. 

Radiator 

Design measures have been used to increase the performance of the radiator itself. 

The performance of a radiator is dependent on its radiation surface. However, the 
intercooler still had to be installed underneath the radiator, and this meant that is was 
necessary to compensate for the smaller flow area available. 

Compared with the N52 engine, the radiator used in the N54 engine has a block depth 
which has been increased to 32 mm. In addition, the water pipes are situated closer 
together than in previously used radiators. The upshot of this is an increase in the utiliz- 
able radiation surface.

Electric Coolant Pump 

The coolant pump of the N54 engine is an electrically driven centrifugal pump with a 
power output of 400W and a maximum flow rate of 9000 l/h. This represents a significant 
increase in power of the electric coolant pump used in the N52 engine, which has a 
power output of 200 W and a maximum flow rate of 7000 l/h.

Motor 




The power of the electric wet-rotor motor is electronically controlled by the electronic 
module (3) in the pump. The electronic module is connected via the bit-serial data inter¬ 
face (BSD) to the MSD80 engine control unit. 

The engine control unit uses the engine load, the operating mode and the data from the 
temperature sensors to calculate the reguired cooling output. Based on this data, the 
engine control unit issues the corresponding command to the electric coolant pump. 

The electric coolant pump regulates its speed in accordance with this command. 

The system coolant flows through the motor of the coolant pump, thus cooling both the 
motor as well as the electronic module. The coolant lubricates the bearings of the 
electric coolant pump. 

The pump must be filled with coolant when removed for service to pre- 
1 vent any corrosion. The pump impeller must be turned by hand before 
^ * - installation to ensure the pump is not seized.

Engine Mechanical 






















































































































































Engine-oil Cooling 

The N54 engine is equipped with a high performance engine-oil cooler. The pendulum- 
slide pump delivers the oil from the oil sump to the oil filter. A thermostat flanged to the 
oil-filter housing admits the oil to the engine-oil cooler. The engine-oil cooler is located in 
the right wheel arch in the E92. The thermostat can reduce the resistance opposing the 
oil by opening the bypass line between the feed and return lines of the engine-oil cooler. 
This ensures that the engine warms up safely and quickly. 




If a separate oil to air cooler is not installed, an auxiliary radiator in 
conjuction with an oil to coolant heat exchanger is used to cool the 
engine oil. 

The auxiliary radiator is connected to the radiator by means of parallel coolant lines, thus 
increasing the cooling surface area. This system is combined with an oil-to-coolant heat 
exchanger mounted on the oil filter housing. (See component “C” in the previous graphic.) 

Auxiliary coolant pump for turbocharger cooling 

Turbo engines that use conventional (mechanical) water pumps (N63, N74) are equipped 
with an additional electrically operated coolant pump with an output of 20 W. Although it 
is used during normal engine operation to assist turbocharger cooling this pump’s main 
function is to carry away the heat build-up from the turbochargers after the engine has 
been shut down. 

The heat input into the engine is calculated based on the injected fuel quantity. This 
function is similar to the heat management function on 6-cylinder engines explained in 
the following pages 

The after-running period of the auxiliary electric coolant pump can extend up to 30 min¬ 
utes. The electric fan also cuts in to improve the cooling effect. As in previous systems, 
the electric fan runs for a maximum of 11 minutes, however, it now operates more fre¬ 
quently.

Heat Management 


The engine control unit of the N54 engine controls the coolant pump according to 
requirements: 

• Low output in connection with low cooling requirements and low outside 
temperatures. 

• High output in connection with high cooling requirements and high outside 
temperatures. 

The coolant pump may also be completely switched off under certain circumstances, 
e.g. to allow the coolant to heat up rapidly during the warm-up phase. However, this only 
occurs when no heating is required and the outside temperature is within the permitted 
range. 

The coolant pump also operates differently than conventional pumps when controlling 
the engine temperature. To date, only the currently applied temperature could be 
controlled by the thermostat. 

The software in the engine control unit now features a calculation model that can take 
into account the development of the cylinder head temperature based on load. 

In addition to the characteristic map control of the thermostat, the heat management 
system makes it possible to use various maps for the purpose of controlling the coolant 
pump. For instance, the engine control unit can adapt the engine temperature to match 
the current operating situation. 

This means that four different temperature ranges can be implemented: 

• 108°C ECO mode 

• 104°C Normal mode 

• 95°C High mode 

• 90°C High + map-thermostat mode 

The control system aims to set a higher cylinder-head temperature (108°C) if the engine 
control unit determines ECO (economy) mode based on the engine performance. 

The engine is operated with relatively low fuel consumption in this temperature range as 
the internal friction is reduced. 

An increase in temperature therefore favors slower fuel consumption in the low load 
range. In HIGH and map-thermostat mode, the driver wishes to utilize the optimum 
power development of the engine. The cylinder-head temperature is reduced to 90°C for 
this purpose. This results in improved volumetric efficiency, thus increasing the engine 
torque. The engine control unit can now set a certain temperature mode adapted to the 
respective operating situation. Consequently, it is possible to influence fuel 
consumption and power output by means of the cooling system. 


37 

Engine Mechanical 



The temperatures specified only ever represent a target value, the attainment of which is 
dependent on many factors. These temperatures are first and foremost not attained 
precisely. 

The consumption-reducing and power increasing effects arise in each case in a 
temperature spectrum. The function of the cooling system is to provide the optimal 
cooling output according to the boundary conditions under which the engine is being 
operated. 

Intelligent Heat Management Options 

The previous section dealt with the various temperature ranges in which heat 
management is effected. However, an electrically driven coolant pump makes available 
even further options. For instance, it is now possible to warm up the engine without 
recirculating the coolant or to allow the pump to continue to operate after turning off the 
engine to facilitate heat dissipation. The advantages offered by this type of pump are 
listed in the following table: 


Consumption 

• Faster warm-up as coolant is not recirculated 
until needed 

• Increased compression ratio due to greater cool¬ 
ing output all full load as compared to similar 
engines without this option 

Emissions 

• Faster engine warm-up by drastically reduced 
pump speed and the lower volumetric flow of 
coolant 

• Reduced friction 

• Reduced fuel consumption 

• Reduced exhaust emissions 

Power Output 

• Component cooling independent of engine 
speed 

• Requirement controlled coolant pump output 

• Avoidance of power loss 

Comfort 

• Optimum volumetric flow 

- Heating capacity reduced as required 

- Residual heat with engine stationary 

Component Protection 

• After-running of electric coolant pump = 
improved heat dissipation from engine switch off 
point. Allows protection of turbochargers by 
reduced oil “coking” during heat soak.

System Protection 

In the event of the coolant or engine oil being subject to excessive temperatures while the 
engine is running, certain functions in the vehicle are influenced so that more energy is 
made available to the engine-cooling system, i.e. temperature-increasing loads are 
avoided. 

These measures are divided into two operating modes: 

• Component protection 

• Emergency

Electronic Oil Condition Monitoring 

There is no dipstick including the guide tube on the N52 engine. This represents a 
convenience function for the customer while enabling more accurate recording of the 
engine oil level. 

The engine oil level is measured by an oil condition sensor (OZS) and indicated in the 
central information display (CID). The engine oil temperature and the oil condition are 
also registered or calculated by the oil condition sensor. The signal from the oil condition 
sensor is evaluated in the ECM. The evaluated signal is then routed via the PT-CAN, 
SGM and the K-CAN to the instrument cluster and to the CID. 

Registering the engine oil level in this way ensures the engine oil level in the engine does 
not reach critically low levels thus protecting the engine from the associated damage. By 
registering the oil condition, it is also possible to determine when the next engine oil 
change is due. Overfilling the engine with oil can cause leaks - a corresponding warning 
is therefore given.

Engine Mechanical 




























































Function of the Oil Condition Sensor 

The sensor consists of two cylindrical capacitors arranged one above the other. The oil 
condition is determined by the lower, smaller capacitor (6). Two metal tubes (2 + 3), 
arranged one in the other, serve as the capacitor electrodes. The dielectric is the engine 
oil (4) between the electrodes. The electrical property of the engine oil changes as the 
wear or aggiing increases and the fuel additives break down. 

The capacitance of the capacitor (oil condition sensor) changes in line with the change in 
the electrical material properties of the engine oil (dielectric). This means that this capaci¬ 
tance value is processed in the evaluation electronics (7) integrated in the sensor to form 
a digital signal. 

The digital sensor signal is transferred to the DME as an indication of the status of the 
engine oil. This actual value is used in the DME to calculate the next oil change service 
due. 

The engine oil level is determined in the upper part of the sensor (5). This part of the 
sensor is located at the same level as the oil in the oil pan. As the oil level drops (dielec¬ 
tric), the capacitance of the capacitor changes accordingly. The electronic circuitry in the 
sensor processes this capacitance value to form a digital signal and transfers the signal to 
the DME. 

A platinum temperature sensor (9) is installed at the base of the oil condition sensor for 
the purpose of measuring the engine oil temperature. 


The engine oil level, engine oil temperature and engine oil condition are registered 
continuously as long as voltage is applied at terminal 15. The oil condition sensor is 
powered via terminal 87. 



Faults/Evaluation 

The electronic circuitry in the oil condition sensor features a self-diagnosis function. A 
corresponding error message is sent to the DME in the event of a fault in the oil condition 
sensor. 


43 

Engine Mechanical 










Electronic Oil Level Indicator 

The oil level is measured in two stages: 

• Static oil level measurement while the vehicle is stationary 

• Dynamic oil level measurement during vehicle operation 

Static oil level measurement at engine OFF 

This is only a reference measurement as the oil condition sensor (OZS) is flooded when 
the engine is turned off and can only detect the minimum oil level. The oil level is 
measured correctly only when the engine is running (see Dynamic oil level measure¬ 
ment). 

After switching on the ignition, the static oil level measurement provides the driver with 
the opportunity of checking whether there is sufficient engine oil for safely and reliably 
starting the engine. 

1. It is important that the vehicle is parked horizontally otherwise the oil level 
measurement may be incorrect. 

2. Select on-board computer function "Service" -> "Oil level". 

If there is sufficient engine oil for safe and reliable engine start, a graphic appears in the 
CID in the form of an engine with a green oil sump. 



44

If the oil level is close to minimum, the 
graphic appears with a yellow oil sump and 
an oil dipstick that represents the low oil 
level in yellow. 

A top-up request +1 liter additionally 
appears as a text message. The display 
will not change if less than 1 liter of oil is 
topped up. MAX is indicated only after top¬ 
ping up a quantity of 1 liter. 

If the oil level drops below minimum, the

The display will not change if less than 1 
liter of oil is topped up. MAX is indicated 
only after topping up a quantity of 1 liter. 

If the oil level is above maximum, the 
graphic appears with a yellow oil sump and 
an oil dipstick that represents the high oil 
level in yellow. 

A text message is also displayed for the

Dynamic oil level measurement during vehicle operation 

Always perform the dynamic oil level measurement (approximately 5 minutes driving time) 
after an oil change. The oil level could be misinterpreted as the oil level last stored is ini¬ 
tially displayed after an oil change. 

No oil level is initially stored after replacing or reprogramming the engine control unit. 

"Oil level below min" is therefore displayed. The correct oil level is indicated after running 
the engine for approximately 5 minutes. 

1. Start engine. 

2. Select on-board computer function - 
“Check oil level". 

3. The oil level is measured. A clock 
symbol may appear while the level 
measurement is running. The clock 
symbol appears for up to 50 seconds 
after starting the engine when there is 
no measured value or the long-term 
value last stored is not within the 
tolerance range of the currently 
measured oil level. 

Dynamic oil level measurement begins when following values are reached: 

• Engine temperature > 60°C 

• Engine speed > 1000 rpm 

• Transverse and longitudinal acceleration < 4-5 m/s2 

The transverse acceleration signal is supplied by the DSC. The longitudinal acceleration 
is calculated from the speed and time factors. 

• Increase < 5% after covering a distance of approximately 200 m. The increase value 
is detected by the ambient pressure sensor in the DME. 

On reaching this value, the oil level indicator is updated approximately 5 minutes after 
starting vehicle operation. The oil level is then continuously measured. The indicator is 
updated at 20 minute intervals. The "Check oil level" menu in connection with the 
dynamic oil level measurement is exited while driving (vehicle speed > 0) approximately 
15 seconds after the oil level is displayed.

The oil level appears in the CID in the form 
of a graphic together with the indication 
that the maximum oil level has been 
exceeded. The excess engine oil must be 
extracted in the workshop down to the 
maximum limit. 

If no oil is extracted, this request will be 
repeated until the oil level drops below the 
maximum limit. This represents an 
advantage that extends beyond the user 
friendliness of the monitoring system. 

Over filling of the engine that can cause 
leaks is indicated as a warning in the instru¬ 
ment cluster.

There is a problem with the measurement 
system if SERVICE appears in the display. 

In this case, the oil level is forecast from the 
oil consumption last measured and shown 
in the display. It is not necessary to immedi¬ 
ately visit a workshop. The remaining kilo¬ 
meters are shown in the service menu. In 
the event of the instrument cluster failing, 
the oil level can also be read out with the 
diagnosis tester.
