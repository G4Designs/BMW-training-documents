N63 Engine 


Introduction 


As the successor to the N62 engine, the N63 was developed based on the principles of 
"Efficient Dynamics". Efficient Dynamics combines driving enjoyment with efficiency 
which, in a new engine, is expressed in increased power output together with reduced 
fuel consumption. 

One of the ways of achieving this objective is through downsizing. This means the same 
power output is achieved with reduced engine displacement or higher power output at 
the same engine displacement. 

Both objectives apply to the N63 engine. Compared to the N62 engine, the power out¬ 
put has been boosted while decreasing the engine displacement. 



In comparison, the N62TU has a displacement of 4.8 liters, while the new N63 engine 
displaces only 4.4 liters. 

This is primarily achieved by technologies that already gave the N54 engine its legendary 
dynamics and outstanding efficiency: Bi-turbocharging in connection with high precision 
injection. 

The N63 is the first engine world-wide to feature an optimized package, involving the 
integration of the turbocharger and the main near-engine catalytic converters in the 
“v-space”. 

With the aim of achieving the demanding performance objectives in connection with 
optimum package and weight, the exhaust turbochargers and the catalytic converters 
have been placed in the v-space between the cylinder banks resulting in the intake and 
exhaust ports changing places. 

With short pipe lengths and larger cross sections, this arrangement minimizes the pres¬ 
sure losses on the intake and exhaust side.

The engine ID and seguential serial number are located on the passenger side of the 
engine behind the AC compressor mounting at the front of the crankcase.

Engine Mechanical 



Engine Housing Components 

Crankcase 

The crankcase of the N63 engine is a new design based on the closed-deck principle 
with lower-set side walls. It is made of an aluminum alloy (Alusil) with honed cylinder 
liners. Similar to the N62 engine, a double main bearing bolting with additional side wall 
mounting is used. There is now no coolant reservoir in this area due to the new arrange¬ 
ment of the turbochargers in the V-space. 


7 

N63 Engine 








Oil Pan 

The 2-piece aluminum oil pan accommodates the oil filter housing and the front differen¬ 
tial on all wheel drive vehicles. It is also important to note that the engine oil dipstick has 
been eliminated as on the New Generation 6-cylinder engines. Oil level monitoring is 
now carried out electronically as in those models. 


8 

N63 Engine 


















Cylinder Head Covers 

The cylinder head covers are made from aluminum alloy. There are accommodations for 
the ignition coils, camshaft sensors and the mounting for the high pressure fuel pump. 


Cyclone separators are contained within the cylinder head covers as replaceable plastic 



components. There are no crankcase ventilation valves on the N63 engine, but there are 
externally mounted check valves similar to the N54. 

Cylinder Head 

The most distinctive new feature on the cylinder head of the N63 engine is the inverse 
arrangement of the intake and exhaust ports. 

At the same time, optimized cross flow through the coolant jacket from the intake to 
exhaust side has been achieved. 



9 

N63 Engine 






The intake port features a trailing edge for creating more intensive charge movement. 
The fuel injectors and spark plugs are arranged transversely adjacent to each other in the 
center of the combustion chamber roof. 

There is now only one non-return valve for the oil circuit integrated in the cylinder head. 
The two non-return valves that were used for VANOS are now integrated in the VANOS 
units. 



Engine Internal Components 

Crankshaft 

To reduce weight, the diameter of the crankshaft’s main bearings have been reduced 
from 70 mm to 65 mm. The crankshaft is a forged steel unit and contains an integrated 
sprocket for the oil pump. 

The oil pump on the N63 engine is driven by the crankshaft on the flywheel side. 

The sprocket is built directly into the crankshaft.

The sprocket is built directly into the crankshaft. 



Timing Gear 

A newly developed tooth-roller chain is used per cylinder bank to drive the camshafts. 
This chain combines the advantages of a tooth type chain and a roller chain, i.e. high 
resistance to wear and low running noise. 

The chain tensioners, tensioning and slide rails are common parts for both cylinder 
banks. The oil spray nozzles are integrated in the chain tensioners. 



The N63 engine is no longer locked at ignition TDC of the first cylinder 
but rather at 150° before ignition TDC of the first cylinder. 

To block off the engine, a special tool is placed on the torsional vibra¬ 
tion damper thus forming the reference for the plug mandrel to the 
crankcase. 


Lubrication System 

The lubrication system utilizes the same volumetric flow-controlled oil pump as seen on 
the six-cylinder N52/N54 engine. This type of oil pump offers the same reduction in fuel 
consumption as on past designs. The main difference on the N63 is that the oil pump is 
chain driven off of the rear of the engine rather than the front as on previous V-8 engines. 



11 

N63 Engine 





Camshafts 

Recent advancements in engine technology have brought about new camshaft designs. 
Most modem BMW engines use some form of composite camshafts which are assem¬ 
bled from individual components rather than machined from an solid cast iron blank. This 
technology not only provides a reduction in manufacturing costs, but also a considerable 
weight savings.

N63 Engine 



















The N63 engine has assembled camshafts of the type as used on the M73 engine. 
All components are shrink-fitted on to the shaft. 



The illustration shows the different components of the camshafts. 

The drive flange, the wrench flats and the flats for the special tool are made from one sin¬ 
gle component. A three-point cam that drives the high pressure pump of the fuel system 
is additionally mounted on the exhaust camshafts. It is located after the first/fifth cylinder. 



Another special feature of the N63 engine is that the exhaust 
camshafts for cylinders 2,4, 7 and 8 produce a different valve lift curve 
than for cylinders 1,3, 5 and 6. The exhaust valves of cylinders 2,4, 7 
and 8 open later, they have a shorter opening period and a smaller 
valve lift for even smoother engine operation. 


13 

N63 Engine 




Infinitely Variable Double VANOS 

The charge cycle in the N63 engine is realized with four valves per cylinder, which are dri¬ 
ven by two overhead camshafts. 

The engine timing can be variably influenced by means of the two infinitely variable 
VANOS units. 

The VANOS units used here have the following timing angles: 

• Intake VANOS unit: 50° crankshaft angle 

• Exhaust VANOS unit: 50° crankshaft angle 

The VANOS units on the N63 engine differ from the VANOS units on the N62 engine. 
The function is identical but some components have been omitted and the VANOS unit 
has been optimized. 

On the N63 engine, the individual vanes of the VANOS unit are no longer individual parts 
but rather they have been further developed to form an oscillating rotor (as on the N52 
engine). 

The torsion spring integrated in the N62 VANOS unit is now designed as a coil spring 
accommodated on the front of the N63 VANOS unit protected by a plastic cover.

Lubrication System 

In the same way as the 6-cylinder engines, the N63 engine is now eguipped with a volu¬ 
metric flow controlled oil pump. It is driven by the crankshaft on the flywheel side. 

The oil pump is designed as a sliding-vane positive displacement pump with a control 
system that also operates in the same way as on the 6- cylinder engines.

The difference is that the oil pressure does not act on the control piston but rather direct¬ 
ly on the slide. The oil pressure that acts on the slide is tapped off downstream of the oil 
filter and cooler, i.e. the pressure prevailing in the system. 


16 

N63 Engine 



























Advantage of volumetric flow-controlled oil pump 

The oil pump uses a considerable proportion of the engine power output. VANOS 
requires a large volume of oil for the purpose of adjusting the camshaft angle. On the 
other hand, VANOS requires no oil flow for retaining the camshaft angle. 

Consequently, the oil requirement depends on the extent of the adjustment operations. 
Conventional oil pumps produce the oil pressure necessary for the largest possible oil 
flow rate that can occur in the engine. In many operating situations, this represents 
unnecessary energy consumption through the oil pump and additional wear of the oil. 

The volumetric flow-controlled oil pump delivers only as much oil as is necessary under 
the respective engine operating conditions. No surplus quantities of oil are delivered in 
low-load operating ranges, thus reducing fuel consumption and oil wear and tear. 

Functional principle of volumetric flow-controlled oil pump 

The pump is designed as a sliding-vane positive displacement pump. In delivery mode, 
the pump shaft is positioned off-center in the housing and the vanes are displaced radial¬ 
ly during rotation. 

As a result, the vanes form chambers of differing volume. The oil is drawn in as the vol¬ 
ume increases and, conversely, expelled into the oil channels as the volume decreases. 

The oil pressure in the system (downstream of the oil filter and oil cooler) acts on the 
slide against the force of a compression spring in the control oil chamber. The slide ele¬ 
ment can rotate about a pivot pin. 

The pressure increases in the system when less oil is required by the lubricating system 
than the pump delivers. As a result, the pressure in the control chamber also increases 
thus turning the slide so that the pump shaft is located more in the center of the slide, 
thus reducing the change in volume and therefore the delivered quantity. 

If the oil required by the engine increases, for example, VANOS control intervention, the 
pressure in the lubricating system drops and is therefore also reduced in the control oil 
chamber. 

The compression spring moves the slide such that the pump shaft is off-center, thus 
increasing the change in volume and therefore the delivered quantity. 

Pressure Relief Valve 

The pressure relief valve is integrated in the oil pump. Pressure upstream of the filter is 
applied to the valve which opens at a pressure of approximately 18 bar. When opened, 
the valve allows surplus oil to flow directly into the oil pan. 


17 

N63 Engine 



Oil Filter 

The N63 engine is equipped with the standard full flow oil filter. It is screwed into the oil 
pan from below. It also features an integrated filter bypass valve. The valve opens when 
the filter is dirty and ensures that the lubrication points still receive engine oil (albeit unfil¬ 
tered). 

No drain valve is fitted due to its installation position. A drain plug in the oil filter cover 
makes it possible to drain the oil out of the filter housing before the oil filter cover is 
opened. 

Oil Cooling 

The oil is cooled via an oil-to-air heat exchanger. This separate oil cooler is located to the 
right of the cooling module. A thermostat only allows the oil to flow through the oil cooler 
when a defined oil temperature has been reached, thus ensuring the engine oil heats up 
at a rapid rate. 

Oil Spray Nozzles 

Oil spray nozzles are used at points that cannot be reached by oil channels. On the N63 
engine, these are the standard oil spray nozzles for piston crown cooling and the oil spray 
nozzles for lubricating the timing chain. 

Oil spray nozzles for piston crown cooling 

The N63 engine has four double oil spray nozzles for cooling the piston crowns. Each oil 
spray nozzle cools an opposing pair of cylinders. 

A piston cooling valve is integrated in the oil spray nozzle. This valve ensures that the oil 
circuit is not drained via the oil spray nozzles while the engine is not running. 

Oil spray nozzles for timing chain lubrication 

The oil spray nozzles for lubricating the timing chains are integrated in the chain tension¬ 
ers of the two cylinder banks. They spray the engine oil directly on to the timing chains. A 
throttle in the oil spray nozzle limits the oil output. 

Chain Tensioner 

The N63 engine is equipped with one chain tensioner per cylinder bank. It is a hydraulic 
chain tensioner that acts on a tensioning rail. 

Chain tensioners always act on the no-load side of the chain, i.e. the slack side. 

Non-return Valves in Cylinder Head 

Non-return valves that prevent the oil channels in the cylinder head draining while the 
engine is not running are normally installed in the cylinder head. 

There is only one non-return valve in the cylinder head of the N63 engine. The nonreturn 
valves for VANOS units are now directly integrated in the solenoid valves. 


18 

N63 Engine 



Crankcase Ventilation System 

The crankcase breather on the N63 engine operates in accordance with the same princi¬ 
ple as on the N54 engine. In the case of the N63 engine, each cylinder bank has its own 
crankcase breather. 

The crankcase ventilation on the N63 operates in two modes, similar to the N54. One 
mode is for turbocharged operation and the other is for “naturally aspirated mode” which 
is usually under deceleration. 

Crankcase breather, naturally-aspirated engine operation 

Because of its exhaust-gas turbocharging, in the same way as the N54 engine, the N63 
engine is equipped with a special crankcase breather. 

The standard function can only be utilized while there is a vacuum in the intake manifold, 
i.e. in naturally-aspirated engine operation. 

As soon as the pressure in the intake manifold is increased by 

turbocharging, the blow-by gasses can no longer be introduced byway of this route. 

A non-return valve is incorporated in the channel to the intake manifold to prevent the 
risk of boost pressure being introduced into the crankcase. 

There is a risk, under conditions of high vacuum, that oil can be drawn in through the 
crankcase breather into the intake manifold. So, this area of the crankcase breather must 
be provided with a pressure limiting facility. 

This is realized in the N63 engine with a restrictor, which limits the throughflow and thus 
also the pressure level in the crankcase breather. As the illustration shows, ventilation 
takes place during naturally aspirated operation via an external line from the cylinder head 
cover to the intake manifold. 

The throttle for limiting pressure on the N63 is integrated in the non-return valve to the 
intake manifold.

Crankcase breather, turbocharged operation 

In turbocharged mode, the pressure in the intake manifold increases and thus closes the 
non-return valve. Because there is a vacuum in the clean-air pipe in this operating range, 
it opens the non-return valve to the clean-air pipe and the blow-by gasses are directed via 
the turbocharger compressor and the intercooler into the intake manifold.

Oil Separator 

Labyrinth and cyclone oil separators are used on the N63 engine. One labyrinth separator 
and four cyclone separators are integrated in the oil separator housing of each cylinder 
bank, however, only three are used at present. 

The fourth is reserved for further developments. The oil mist drawn out of crankcase is 
routed through the labyrinth. This serves as the first oil separation stage as the oil col¬ 
lects on the walls of the labyrinth and flows off. The further flow of blow-by-gas is made 
to swirl in the cyclones. 

As a result of the centrifugal forces, the heavier oil settles on the cyclone walls and from 
there drips into the oil drain. The lighter blow-by gas is drawn out from the middle of the 
cyclone. The cleaned blow-by gas is then fed to the air intake system.

If the exhaust system produces blue smoke, it is necessary to check 
whether the engine is also drawing oil into the combustion chamber 
through the crankcase breather, which suggest that there is a fault in 
the area of the crankcase breather. A clear sign of a problem is an oiled 
up clean-air pipe. 


24 

N63 Engine 










Belt Drive 


The N63 engine is equipped as standard with a double belt drive. The main belt drive 
features a mechanical tensioning pulley that provides the necessary tension in the 
poly-V-belt. 

The A/C compressor is driven by a ELAST drive belt which is mounted and tensioned 
in a new way.

The belt pulley on the torsional vibration 
damper can be shifted in a defined posi¬ 
tion in the direction of the A/C compressor. 
This makes it possible to easily install the 
ELAST drive belt without the need for spe¬ 
cial tools. 

This is made possible by an eccentric slot 
in the belt pulley, which allows the crank¬ 
shaft to be shifted in radial direction after 
the four mounting screws holding the belt 
pulley have been removed. 

The tension in the ELAST drive belt pulls 
the belt pulley back into the central posi¬ 
tion over the crankshaft when the engine is 
now turned by 180°. 

The bolts can then be re-installed to com¬ 
plete the belt change.

Air Intake and Exhaust System 


The main change to the air intake and exhaust system of the N63 engine is the inter¬ 
changed positions of the intake and exhaust sides. 

Consequently, the exhaust manifolds and turbochargers as well as the catalytic convert¬ 
ers are located in the V-space of the engine. 

This arrangement makes the N63 engine very compact despite the turbocharging. 
Another new feature is indirect charge air cooling with intercoolers mounted on the 
engine.

Turbocharging 

The turbocharging principle of the N63 engine is very similar to that of the N54 engine. 
Two relatively small, parallel-connected exhaust turbochargers ensure rapid response 
already at low engine speeds. 

The boost pressure is controlled by means of wastegate valves. Diverter valves are also 
used.

N63 Engine 



















Principle of Operation 

The turbocharger is driven by the engine's exhaust gasses, i.e. exhaust gasses under 
pressure are routed by the turbocharger 

turbine and in this way delivers the motive force to the compressor, which rotates on the 
same shaft. It is here that the induction air is precompressed in such a way that a higher 
air mass is admitted into the engine's combustion chamber. 

In this way, it is possible to inject and combust a greater guantity of fuel, which increases 
the engine's power output and torgue. 

The turbine and the compressor can rotate at speeds of up to 175,000 rpm. The 
exhaust inlet temperature can reach a maximum of 950°C. 

Because of these high temperatures, the turbochargers of the N63 engine are not only 
connected with the engine oil system but also integrated in the engine coolant circuit. 

In connection with the auxiliary electric coolant pump on the N63 engine, even after the 
engine has been switched off, it is possible to dissipate the residual heat from the tur¬ 
bochargers, thus preventing the lubricating oil in the bearing housing from overheating. 

Bi-turbocharging 

Great importance is attached to turbocharger response in the N63 engine. A delayed 
response to the driver's command, i.e. the accelerator-pedal position, is not acceptable. 

The driver therefore must not experience any so-called "turbo lag". This reguirement is 
met in the N63 engine with two relatively small turbochargers, which are connected in 
parallel. Each cylinder bank drives one exhaust turbocharger. 

The advantage of smaller turbochargers lies in the fact that, as the turbocharger runs up 
to speed, the lower moment of inertia of the turbine causes fewer masses to be acceler¬ 
ated, thus allowing the compressor to attain a higher boost pressure in a shorter amount 
of time. 

Boost Pressure Control 

The boost pressure of the turbochargers is directly dependent on the flow of exhaust gas 
which reaches the turbocharger turbines. Both the velocity and the mass of the exhaust 
gas flow are directly dependent on engine speed and engine load. The engine manage¬ 
ment system uses wastegate valves to control the boost pressure. 

These valves are operated by vacuum units, which are controlled by electropneumatic 
pressure converters (EPDW) via the engine management system. 

The vacuum is generated by the permanently driven vacuum pump and stored in a pres¬ 
sure accumulator. The system is designed to ensure that these loads/consumers do not 
have a negative influence on the brake boost function. 

The flow of exhaust gas to the turbine wheel can be influenced with the wastegate valves. 
When the boost pressure has reached its desired level, the wastegate valve begins to 
open and direct part of the exhaust-gas flow past the turbine wheel. 


32 

N63 Engine 



This prevents the turbine from further increasing the speed of the compressor. This con¬ 
trol option allows the system to respond to various operating situations. 

In the idle phase, the wastegate valves of both turbochargers are closed. This enables 
the full exhaust-gas flow available to be 

utilized to speed up the compressor already at these low engine speeds. When power is 
then demanded from the engine, the compressor can deliver the reguired boost pressure 
without any noticeable time lag. 

In the full-load situation, the boost pressure is maintained at a consistently high level 
when the maximum permissible torgue is reached by a partial opening of the wastegate 
valves. In this way, the compressors are only ever induced to rotate at a speed which is 
called for by the operating situation. 

Opening of the wastegate valves takes drive energy from, the turbine thus limiting the 
charger speed and preventing overspeed. In addition, there is no further increase in boost 
pressure, thus benefiting fuel consumption. 

At full-load the N63 engine operates at an overpressure of up to 0.8 bar in the intake 
manifold. 

Blow-off Control 

The diverter valves in the N63 engine reduce unwanted peaks in boost pressure which 
can occur when the throttle valve closes guickly. 

They therefore have an important function with regard to engine acoustics and help to 
protect the turbocharger components.

A vacuum is generated in the intake manifold when the throttle valve is closed at high 
engine speeds. This leads to a build-up of high dynamic pressure after the compressor 
which cannot escape because the route to the intake manifold is blocked. 

This leads to a "pumping up" of the turbocharger. This means that 

• a clearly noticeable, disruptive pumping noise can be heard, 

• and this pumping noise is accompanied by a component-damaging load being 
exerted on the turbocharger, since high-freguency pressure waves exert axial load on 
the turbocharger bearings. 

The diverter valves are electrically operated valves. When the throttle valve closes, the 
boost pressure (upstream of the throttle valve) and its increase are compared with stored 
target values. 

The diverter valves are opened if the actual values exceed the target by a certain value. 

As a result, the boost pressure is diverted to the intake side of the compressor. 

This procedure prevents the disruptive and component-damaging pumping effect from 
occurring.

Charge Air Cooling 

Indirect charge air cooling is used for the first time on the N63 engine. The charge air is 
not routed directly to an air-to-air heat exchanger. 

The charge air is cooled by means of an air-to-coolant heat exchanger. The N63 engine 
therefore features a separate self contained low-temperature coolant circuit. 



Cooling the charge air serves to increase power output as well as reduce fuel consump¬ 
tion. The charge air heated in the turbocharger by its component temperature and by 
compression is cooled in the intercooler by up to 80°C. 

This increases the density of the charge air, which in turn improves the charge in the 
combustion chamber. This results in a lower level of reguired boost pressure. The risk of 
knock is also reduced and the engine operates with improved efficiency. 

Indirect charge air cooling has the advantage of reguiring little space as the system can 
be mounted directly on the engine. Due to the near-engine installation position, the dis¬ 
tinctly shorter pipe length reguired for charge air routing also have a positive effect. 


35

In this way, pressure loss has been substantially reduced, thus improving power yield and 
engine response.

Load Control 


Load control of the N63 engine is realized by means of the throttle valve and the waste- 
gate valves. 

The throttle valve is the primary component in this process. The wastegate valves are 
actuated to bring about a fine tuning of the boost pressure. At full load the throttle valve 
is completely open and load control is undertaken by the wastegate valves. 


The load control graphic shows that the wastegate valves are integrated in load control in 
all operating situations of the N63 engine on the basis of characteristic map control.

Controlled Variables 

Among other things, the following variables influence boost 
pressure control in the N63 engine: 

• Intake-air temperature 

• Engine speed 

• Throttle-valve position 

• Ambient pressure 

• Intake-manifold pressure 

• Pressure before the throttle valve (reference variable) 

The electropneumatic pressure transducers are activated by the engine control unit on 
the basis of these variables. 

The result of this activation can be checked from the boost pressure achieved, which is 
measured before the throttle valve. 

There follows a comparison of the boost pressure achieved with the setpoint data from 
the characteristic map, which can, if necessary, give rise to an activation correction. 

The system therefore controls and monitors itself during operation. 

Limp-home Mode 

In the event during operation of malfunctions, implausible values or failure of any of the 
sensors involved in turbocharger control, activation of the wastegate valves is shut down 
and the valve flaps are thus fully opened. Turbocharging ceases at this point. 

The list below sets out those components or functional groups of the N63 engine in 
which a failure, a malfunction or implausible values result in boost pressure control being 
deactivated. 

The driver is alerted to a fault of this type by the emission warning lamp. 

• High pressure fuel system 

• Inlet VANOS 

• Exhaust VANOS 

• Crankshaft sensor 

• Camshaft sensor 

• Boost-pressure sensor 

• Knock sensors 

• Intake-air temperature sensor 


38 

N63 Engine 




One principle of vehicle repair is particularly important in this respect: 

When diagnosing any fault, particularly with a turbocharged engine, it is important to 
focus on causes rather than the effects. 

With regard to the diagnosis and subsequent repair of turbocharging components, it is 
important to ensure that they are also actually identified as defective components with 
the diagnostic technology available. It is always vital to ensure that the cause of the fault 
is determined and rectified and that if necessary work is not carried out on symptoms of 
fault consequences. 

Thus, for instance, a leaking flange on the intercooler can have far-reaching conse¬ 
quences. 

The N63 engine also is governed by three golden rules of procedure: 

1. It is important to not immediately blame the turbocharger for all power related 
complaints. Turbochargers are frequently mis-diagnosed and unnecessarily 
replaced. If blue smoke emerges from the exhaust system, check whether the air 
cleaner is contaminated or the engine is consuming too much oil because of wear. 
If the turbocharger is running too loud, inspect all the connections on the tur¬ 
bocharger pressure side. If black smoke or a loss of power is detected, in this case 
check the engine and the connecting pipes first. 

2. Main causes of turbocharger damage: 

• Insufficient lubrication and consequently bearing failure. 

• Foreign bodies damage the turbine and impeller. The resulting imbalance 
will reduce efficiency and may cause rotor damage. 

• Contaminated lube oil causes scoring on shaft journals and bearings. 

Elements entering the turbocharger system from the out side such as sand, 
dirt, screws and the like will be trapped by a filter before the compressor. 

Service the filters at regular intervals (service intervals). 

3. Do not make any alterations to the turbocharger. 

Never attempt to tamper with or alter the boost-pressure control linkage. If the tur¬ 
bocharger operates at higher boost pressures than permitted by the engine manu¬ 
facturer, the engine may run hot and pistons, cylinder heads or engine bearings 
may fail, or the safety function of the engine electronics may respond and activate 
the engine's limp-home program.

The admission pressure is monitored by the low pressure sensor. The fuel is delivered by 
the electric fuel pump in line with demand. If this sensor fails, the electric fuel pump con¬ 
tinues to run at 100% delivery with terminal 15 ON. 

The fuel is compressed in the permanently driven single-piston high pressure pump and 
delivered through the high pressure line to the rail. 

The fuel accumulated under pressure in the rail in this way is distributed via the high 
pressure lines to the piezo-injectors. 

The reguired fuel delivery pressure is determined by the engine-management system as 
a function of engine load and engine speed. The pressure level reached is recorded by 
the rail pressure sensor and communicated to the engine control unit. 

Control takes place by means of the volume control valve based on setpoint/actual value 
adjustment of the rail pressure. 

Configuration of the pressure is geared towards best possible consumption and smooth 
running of the N63 engine. 200 bar is reguired only at high load and low engine speed.

Design and function of high pressure pump 

The fuel is delivered via the supply passage at the admission pressure generated by the 
electric fuel pump to the high pressure pump. 

From there, the fuel is directed via the volume control valve and the low pressure non¬ 
return valve into the fuel chamber of the plunger and-barrel assembly.

N63 Engine 













































































The fuel is placed under pressure by a piston in this plunger-and-barrel assembly and 
delivered via the high pressure non-return valve to the high pressure port. The high pres¬ 
sure pump is bolted to the cylinder head and is driven by a three-point cam on the 
camshaft. 



This means the piston is permanently moved by the three-point cam as soon as the 
engine is running. Fuel therefore continues to be pressurized for as long as new fuel is 
supplied to the high pressure pump via the volume control valve. 

The volume control valve is activated by means of the engine management connection 
and determines the delivered guantity of fuel. 

The pressure is controlled by the volume control valve opening and closing in the direc¬ 
tion from the plunger and barrel assembly to the fuel inlet. 

The fuel drawn in by the piston is largely forced back into the pressure inlet when the vol¬ 
ume control valve is opened. 

The maximum pressure in the high pressure area is limited to 245 bar. If excessive pres¬ 
sure is encountered, the high pressure circuit is relieved by a pressure relief valve via the 
ports leading to the low pressure area. 


43 

N63 Engine 



This is possible without any problems because of the incompressibility of the fuel, 
i.e. the fuel does not change in volume in response to a change in pressure. 

The pressure peak created is compensated for by the liquid volume in the low pressure 
area. The equalization chamber is incorporated in the feed to the high pressure pump. 

It has the task of reducing the pressure peaks produced by piston movement in the low 
pressure system. 

When the piston generates pressure, fuel passes between the piston and its guide. 

This is intentional for lubrication purposes. 

A higher pressure is produced at the rear of the piston as it moves downwards. This could 
give rise to the danger of fuel being forced through the seal of the piston out of the pump 
and into the engine oil system. The connection to the equalization chamber ensures that 
there is never a pressure higher than the fuel feed behind the piston. 

When opened, the volume control valve prevents pressure fluctuations being transmitted 
into the low pressure system as changes in volume before and after the piston are equal¬ 
ized. 

Hydraulics diagram of fuel system 

The volume control valve controls the fuel pressure in the rail. It is activated by the engine 
management system via a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal. 

Depending on the activation signal, a restrictor cross-section of varying size is opened 
and the fuel-mass flow required for the respective load point is set. 

The pressure relief valve additionally provides the option of reducing the pressure in the 
fuel rail by directing the fuel out of the high pressure system back into the pump element.

Fuel Injectors 

The fuel injectors on the N63 are the familiar piezo-electric design carried over from the 
N54. 

The outward opening, piezo injectors are an integral part of the spray-guided injection 
strategy used on the HPI injection system. 

This type of piezo-injector ensures that the injected fuel spray cone remains stable, even 
under the prevailing influences of pressure and temperature in the combustion chamber. 

This injector design permits injection pressures of up to 200 bar and extremely guick 
opening of the nozzle needle. In this way, it is possible to inject fuel into the combustion 
chamber under conditions released from the power cycles limited by the valve opening 
times. 



The piezo-injector is integrated together with the spark plug centrally between the inlet 
and exhaust valves in the cylinder head. This installation position prevents the cylinder 
walls or the piston crown from being wetted with injected fuel. 


46 

N63 Engine 


A uniform formation of the homogeneous air/fuel mixture is obtained with the aid of the 
gas movement in the combustion chamber and a stable fuel spray cone. 

The gas movement is influenced on the one hand by the geometry of the intake pas¬ 
sages and on the other hand by the shape of the piston crown. The injected fuel is 
swirled in the combustion 

chamber with the boost air until a homogeneous mixture is available throughout the com¬ 
pression space at the point of ignition. 

Injector adjustment 

As with the piezo injectors from the N54, the injector adjustment must be carried out 
when the injectors are replaced. 

When the injectors are manufactured, a multitude of measurement data is recorded at 
specific points in the factory. In this way, the 

tolerance ranges for injector-quantity adjustment are determined and specified in a six¬ 
digit number combination. 

Information on the lift performance of the injector is also added for injector voltage adjust¬ 
ment. Injector adjustment is required because of the individual voltage demand of each 
piezo-actuator. 

An allocation is made to a voltage demand category, which is included in the number 
combination on the injector. These data are transmitted to the control unit. 

During engine operation, these values are used to compensate for deviations in the 
metering and switching performance. 

When replacing an injector, it is absolutely essentially to carry out an injector adjustment. 


47 

N63 Engine 



Injection Strategy 

Injection of the fuel mass required for the operating situation can take place in up to three 
individual injections. Which option is used in the relevant operating situation is depen¬ 
dent on engine load and speed. 

Here the actual time resulting from the engine speed available for metering the fuel is an 
important framework quantity. 

The following graphic shows the fuel injection strategy for an engine at operating temper¬ 
ature. 

A special situation during the operation of any engine is the range in which a high load 
occurs at low engine speed, so-called "Low End Torque" operation. In this operating situ¬ 
ation, the required fuel mass is metered to the engine in three individual injections. 

This results in a highly effective mixture formation which in the final analysis has the 
effect of both increasing power output and saving fuel.

Operating mode: Catalytic Converter Heating 

In order to bring the catalytic converters up to operating temperature as quickly as possi¬ 
ble, the N63 engine has a catalytic converter heating mode for when the engine is started 
from cold. 

In this mode, combustion heat is intentionally introduced into the exhaust train and not 
used first and foremost to develop power output. The point of ignition is moved to 30° 
crankshaft angle afterTDC. 

The main quantity of the required fuel is injected before TDC and mixed with the boost 
air. The piston is situated afterTDC in its downward travel such that the air/fuel mixture is 
already expanding again, which reduces the ignitability of the mixture. 

In order to ignite the mixture reliably, a small residual quantity of fuel is injected 25° crank¬ 
shaft angle afterTDC and this guarantees an ignitable mixture at the spark plug. 

This small fuel quantity therefore provides for ignition of the residual charge in the com¬ 
bustion chamber. This operating mode is set by the engine-management system after a 
maximum period of 60 seconds from engine starting but is terminated if the catalytic con¬ 
verter response temperature is reached earlier. 

Injector control and adaptation 

The fuel mass required for the operating situation is injected by the piezo-injector into the 
combustion chamber. This mass can be influenced by three correcting variables: 

• the rail pressure 

• the injector opening time 

• and the injector opening lift 

The injector opening time and the injector opening lift are activated directly at the piezo 
injector. The opening time is controlled via the signal ti and the opening lift via the energy 
quantity in the activation of the piezo-injector. 

Injector adaptation 

The fuel masses and injection cycles determined from the load/speed map are included 
in a pilot-control program map. Here, while further framework parameters are taken into 
consideration, the energy quantities and injector opening times required to activate the 
injectors are determined. The N63 engine can be safely and reliably operated with these 
characteristic map values. 

For optimization of: 

• Emission values 

• Smooth running 

• Fuel consumption 

• Power output 

49 

N63 Engine 



The controlled variables of energy quantities and injector opening times are continuously 
monitored. This occurs on a cylinder-selective basis byway of lambda closed-loop con¬ 
trol. 

The residual oxygen in the exhaust gas is measured in each case for cylinder bank 1 and 
cylinder bank 2. The new oxygen sensors permit allocation to the individual cylinders. 

This measurement result is compared with the values expected from the set correcting 
variables. The result of a deviation is that the injector opening signal is adapted. This 
adaptation is stored in the control unit and is therefore available for subsequent engine 
operation. 

However, these stored values are lost when the system is flashed and must be relearned. 
A further adaptation of the injector activation takes place depending on time and use. 

This cylinder-selective adaptation involves a check of the residual oxygen content with a 
conclusion as to the cylinder causing the situation. 

To this end, it is necessary for part of the exhaust gas flow not to be swirled in the 
turbocharger. For this reason, the flap of the wastegate valve must be fully opened, i.e. 
swung out of the exhaust-gas flow. This wastegate flap position extends beyond its 
normal opening position in engine operation. 

Based on the result of this cylinder-selective monitoring, the energy quantity is adapted if 
necessary to activate the injectors. 

Furthermore, the cylinder-selective adaptation includes if necessary an adaptation of the 
injector opening signal based on smooth running monitoring of the N63 engine. 

Overall adaptation of the injectors is limited to a 15% additional quantity. 

HPI Limp-home mode 

If a fault is diagnosed in the system, such as e.g. failure of the rail pressure sensor, the vol¬ 
ume control valve is de-energized; the fuel then flows via a so-called bypass into the rail. 

In the event of HPI limp-home mode, turbocharging is deactivated by an opening of the 
wastegate valves. 

Causes of HPI limp-home mode may be: 

• Implausible rail pressure sensor values 

• Failure of volume control valve 

• Leakage in high pressure system 

• Failure of high pressure pump 

• Failure of rail pressure sensor

Fuel System Safety 


• Working on this fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. 

The coolant temperature must not exceed 40°C. This must be observed without fail, 
otherwise there is a danger of fuel sprayback on account of the residual pressure in 
the high pressure system. 

• When working on the high pressure fuel system, take particular care to ensure con¬ 
ditions of absolute cleanliness and follow the work seguences described in the 
repair instructions. Even the tiniest contaminants and damage to the screw connec¬ 
tions on the high pressure lines can cause leaks. 

• When working on the fuel system of the N63 engine, it is important to ensure that 
the ignition coils are not fouled by fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is sig¬ 
nificantly reduced by heavy fuel contact. This can cause sparkover at the spark-plug 
head and cause misfires. 

• Before making modifications to the fuel system, remove the ignition coils without fail 
and protect the spark-plug slot against the ingress of fuel with a cloth. 

• Before refitting the piezo-injector, remove the ignition coils and ensure conditions of 
absolute cleanliness. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced. 




Do not open fuel lines until the 
coolant temperature has cooled 
to below 40 degrees Celsius 
(104 degrees Fahrenheit).

Cooling System 


Due to the exhaust turbocharging system and the compact arrangement of the tur¬ 
bochargers in the V-space, the heat output of the N63 engine is very high. 
Correspondingly, great significance is attached to the cooling system. In addition, an 
indirect charge air cooling system has been developed for the first time where the 
charge air is cooled by an air-to-coolant heat exchanger. There are two separate cooling 
circuits for engine and charge air cooling.

Engine Cooling 

The engine cooling system undertakes the classic task of carrying heat away from the 
engine and maintaining a defined operating temperature as constant as possible. As on 
the N54 engine, the two turbochargers are also cooled. 

The N63 engine features a conventional coolant pump that is driven by the belt drive. 
This pump cannot be used to continue cooling the turbochargers after the engine has 
been shut down.

Auxiliary Coolant Pump for Turbocharger Cooling 

The electric coolant pump on the N54 engine features an after-running function to carry 
away the heat build-up from the turbochargers after the engine has been shut down. 

For this function, the N63 engine is eguipped with an additional electrically operated 
coolant pump with an output of 20 W. This pump is also used during engine operation to 
assist turbocharger cooling. 

The auxiliary electric coolant pump cuts in, taking the following factors into consideration: 

• Coolant temperature at engine outlet 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected fuel guantity 

The heat input into the engine is calculated based on the injected fuel guantity. 

This function is similar to the heat management function on 6-cylinder engines. 

The after-running period of the auxiliary electric coolant pump can extend up to 30 min¬ 
utes. The electric fan also cuts in to improve the cooling effect. 

As in previous systems, the electric fan runs for a maximum of 11 minutes, however, 
it now operates more freguently. 

System Protection 

As on the N54 engine, in the event of the coolant or engine oil being subject to excessive 
temperatures, certain functions in the vehicle are influenced in such a way that more 
energy is made available to the engine cooling system, i.e. temperature increasing loads 
are avoided.

N63 Engine 



Charge Air Cooling 

With the introduction of the N63 engine, indirect charge air cooling is used for the first 
time at BMW. Heat is taken from the charge air by means of an air-to-coolant heat 
exchanger. This heat is then given off via a coolant-to-air heat exchanger into the ambient 
air. For this purpose, the charge air cooling system has its own low temperature cooling 
circuit, which is independent of the engine cooling circuit.

Intercoolers 

The intercoolers are installed on the end faces of the cylinder heads. They operate in 
accordance with the counterflow principle and cool the charge air by up to 80°C. 

Electric Coolant Pump 

The coolant circuit for charge air coolant is operated with a 50 W pump. This pump does 
not run automatically when the engine is turned on. 

Pump actuation depends on the following values: 

• Outside temperature 

• Difference between charge air temperature and outside temperature 

Venting 

A separate venting routine is provided for the purpose of venting the low-temperature cir¬ 
cuit of the charge air cooling system. This venting is initiated in the same way as for the 
cooling circuit on 6-cylinder engines. 

The venting test module can be found in the “Service Functions” section of the diagnos¬ 
tic program.
