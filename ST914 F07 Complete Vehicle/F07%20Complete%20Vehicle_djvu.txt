Introduction 


The BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo is a completely new and unique vehicle concept. It is 
an independent model variant that supplements the BMW 5 Series. The N63 power- 
plant in the 550i Gran Turismo is combined with a new 8 speed automatic transmission 
and the incorporation of Brake Energy Regeneration, this is the first BMW vehicle of its 
kind ever introduced to the US market. It is the modern reinterpretation of a stylish, clas¬ 
sical Gran Turismo - with the characteristic features of a sedan, a flexible touring wagon 
and of a versatile SUV. 

Gran Turismo (Italian for “Grand Touring”) refers to powerful touring sedans which, in 
contrast to pure sports cars, used to feature more comfort, a larger interior and greater 
suitability for daily use on long journeys. 

The expectations with regard to a modern Gran Turismo for long and comfortable jour¬ 
neys are exceeded with the generously and luxuriously equipped interior. Worldwide, 
there is no other vehicle that is so perfectly suited for the business world, leisure and 
sport in equal measure. 

The seat position has been raised noticeably; the main advantage of this for all passen¬ 
gers is that it is very easy to get in and out of the vehicle. This seat position also provides 
the driver with a better view of traffic conditions, and thus a feeling of greater confidence 
on the road. 

The clever luggage compartment lid of the BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo uses a double 
opening mode design that splits the tail gate into two parts. Depending on the cargo 
requirements, either the large luggage compartment lid can be opened to load large, 
bulky objects or for smaller items just the small luggage compartment lid below the rear 
window can be opened.

Body Shell 

For the F07 construction BMW used lightweight materials wherever possible. This is 
achieved with the intelligent application of higher-strength, multi-phase steels and super¬ 
strength, press hardened steels. 

The construction with lightweight materials makes a decisive contribution to reducing the 
vehicle weight. In conjunction with a rigid design of the body shell, it makes a significant 
contribution to the following: 

• Driving dynamics 

• Reducing fuel consumption 

• Reducing C02 emissions 

• Passive safety. 

Weight reduction features include: 

• Spring strut towers made of die-cast aluminum (2% of the body shell weight) 

• High proportion of multi-phase steels (20% of the bodyshell weight) 

• High proportion of press hardened steels (12% of the body shell weight). 

In the case of the press hardened steels, an innovative corrosion protection process is 
used. This means that additional corrosion protection measures are no longer required for 
this steel. 

The spring strut towers made of die-cast aluminum make the front end more rigid and 
are designed to meet the high load requirements. Compared with conventional steel shell 
construction method, the compact construction method has greatly reduced the installa¬ 
tion space required and reduced the weight in the front section of the vehicle. Among 
other things, this leads to even axle-load distribution. 

The higher-strength multi-phase steels and super-strength press hardened steels ensure 
maximum strength of the safety occupant cell with low weight, thus making a huge con¬ 
tribution to passive safety. 

Materials 

A modern vehicle body must meet a great many requirements. Despite small outer 
dimensions, it should provide an interior that is a large as possible. In the event of an acci¬ 
dent, the passengers must be protected against injury as well as possible. The torque 
that is generated also means that all units, e.g. the engine and transmission, rely heavily 
on the body structure for support. Furthermore, the body must have high static and above 
all dynamic strength in order to guarantee the outstanding driving characteristics that are 
typical of BMW. 


11 

F07 Complete Vehicle 



Last but not least, the supporting structure of the vehicle must be durable over the long 
term and, in the event of an accident, it must be possible for repairs to be carried out at a 
reasonable cost and with a minimum amount of effort. 

In order to meet all of these requirements, BMW pursues the strategy of creating each 
component from the material best suited for its function. 

The two expressions aluminum and steel are merely generic terms for the large number 
of alloys with very different properties that are deployed.

Note: Rockers, doors, hood and deck lid of the F07 are made from aluminum. 


12 

F07 Complete Vehicle 













Multi-phase steels are steels where the structure consists of a number of phases. Higher- 
strength multi-phase steels with a limit of elasticity Rp0.2 of 300 to 600 MPa are e.g. 
dual-phase steels or TRIP steels. Higher-strength multi-phase steels with a limit of elas¬ 
ticity Rp 0.2 above 600 MPa are e.g. complex- phase steels or martensitic-phase steels. 

The press hardened manganese-boron steels are super-strength steels with a limit of 
elasticity Rp 0.2 above 900 MPa. 

Dual Phase (DP) Steels 

Dual-phase steel (DPA) is a high-strength steel that has a ferrite and martensitic 
microstructure. DPA starts as a low or medium carbon steel and is quenched from a pre¬ 
determined temperature on a continuous cooling transformation diagram. This results in 
a microstructure consisting of a soft ferrite matrix containing islands of martensite as the 
secondary phase (martensite increases the tensile strength). 

Transformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP) Steel 

TRIP steel is a high-strength steel typically used in the automotive industry. TRIP stands 
for “transformation induced plasticity.” TRIP steel has a triple phase microstructure con¬ 
sisting of ferrite, bainite, and retained austenite. During deformation and straining, the 
metastable austenite phase is transformed into martensite. This transformation allows for 
enhanced strength and ductility. 

Complex Phase (CP) Steels 

CP steels typify the transition to steel with very high ultimate tensile strengths. The 
microstructure of CP steels contains small amounts of martensite, retained austenite and 
pearlite within the ferrite/bainite matrix. 

Martensitic (MS) Steels 

To create MS steels, the austenite that exists during hot-rolling or annealing is trans¬ 
formed almost entirely to martensite during quenching on the run-out table or in the cool¬ 
ing section of the continuous annealing line. The martensite is formed by rapid cooling 
(quenching) of austenite which traps carbon atoms that do not have time to diffuse out of 
the crystal structure. 


Note: Megapascal (MPa) is a metric unit of pressure or stress equal to one mil¬ 
lion pascals or one newton per square millimeter used to measure ten¬ 
sile strength.

Weight proportions 

In order to reduce the vehicle weight and still ensure maximum strength of the body shell, 
the proportion of higher-strength multi-phase steels, super-strength press hardened 
steels and aluminum used is growing.

Corrosion protection and leak-resistance 

In order to optimize corrosion protection, mainly galvanized steel plates and sheet 
aluminum plates are used on the body of the F07. The joining technologies used are 
welding, bonding and riveting. 

The overlaps of the metal plates are designed in such a way that the join surfaces are 
minimized. This prevents bond- line corrosion. Water is prevented from entering the body 
structure by means of constructive bonding and sealing of the join surfaces. 

In particularly critical areas, expansion foam parts are used to seal the body cavities 
against moisture. 

Sheet doubling point in wet chambers are sealed off and, if required, additionally 
preserved with wax. 

Where required, the overlaps of the metal plates in dry chambers are sealed off to prevent 
dust from entering. 

Material pairings that could be critical with regard to corrosion are avoided. The combina¬ 
tion of material substrates and joining methods is carefully co-ordinated to eliminate the 
risk of corrosion. 

Coating process 

In the painting process in the immersion cleaning unit, the bodyshell is: 

• cleaned by alkali, 

• phosphated (roughing of the surface for better adhesion) and 

• coated in the immersion process with KTL (corrosion protection paint that coats 
all the body cavities from the inside). 

The organic layer of paint is then heat treated (baked). 

Furthermore, the body is sealed with PVC and protected by filler, top coat and clear 
varnish on the outer skin. 

On the F07, particularly critical body areas are given cavity sealing. 

The objectives are: 

• No visible corrosion at all for 3 years 

• No rust damage for 12 years 

• High leak-tightness against water and dust.

Luggage Compartment Lid in Lid 

A luggage compartment lid system with two full luggage compartment lids that can be 
opened independently of one another is fitted for the first time in the F07. This enables 
the F07 to provide all the benefits of a classical saloon and of a wagon. There has never 
before been a system of this kind at BMW.

Depending on requirements, the small or large luggage compartment lid can opened for 
loading. 

• For loading small objects (e.g. pocket, jacket, coats, etc.), the small luggage com¬ 
partment lid can be opened. In contrast to a wagon or SUV, when the luggage 
compartment partition wall is locked the passengers are protected against outside 
influences such as wind and weather while loading. 

• For loading large objects (e.g. bicycles, skis, golf bags, carrying cases, etc.), the large 
luggage compartment lid can be opened. 

On vehicles with a rearview camera system (SA 3AG is part of ZCE Camera Package), 
the rearview camera is integrated in the handle strip of the luggage compartment lid. 

Structure, concept 

The centerpiece of the luggage compartment lid system in the F07 is the supporting 
frame made of die-cast aluminum. Until now, a die-cast component of this size and 
dimensional accuracy has never been manufactured. 

F07 supporting frame 



Among other things, the purpose of the supporting frame is to accommodate the small 
luggage compartment lid, the rear window and many trim panel components. 

In the event of repairs, the supporting frame must be subjected to a visual inspection to 
identify cracks or deformations; if necessary, it must be replaced. 

Note: The supporting frame structure must not be repaired if necessary it must 
be replaced as a unit.

Operating and control concept 

The small luggage compartment lid can be opened with the following: 

• Middle button on the luggage compartment lid 

• Remote control 

• Button in the vehicle on the A-pillar. 

The large luggage compartment lid can be opened with the following: 

• Right-hand button on the luggage compartment lid 

(the lock unlocks and the luggage compartment lid has to be opened by 
hand or it opens automatically on vehicles with Power Tailgate SA 316) 

• Remote control 

Press and hold the diamond button on the remote to operate the large tailgate 
automatically (only on vehicles with power tailgate (SA 316) 



F07 opening height of the large 
luggage compartment lid 


On vehicles with automatic rear lid actuation (SA 316 Power tailgate), the opening height 
of the large luggage compartment lid can be adjusted using the controller. A button on 
the luggage compartment lid activates the continued movement function. Here, the lug¬ 
gage compartment lid continues to move as long as the button is pressed or until the 
maximum opening of approximately 2290 mm (to the lower edge of luggage compart¬ 
ment lid) is reached.

Assembly position 

The emergency release can be used to open both luggage compartment lids simultane¬ 
ously for vehicle assembly or repair (e.g. for removing and fitting the top and bottom load 
edge trim). 

For customer operation, the lids are electrically locked against one another. 


F07 assembly position of luggage compartment lids 



Note: When opening the luggage compartment lids, make sure there is 
sufficient space available, as otherwise damage can occur. 

The altered position of the center of gravity of the small luggage compartment lid 
increases the opening speed of the large luggage compartment lid. This can damage the 
gas pressure springs or spindle drives (with SA 316, Power Tailgate). This is why the large 
luggage compartment lid must be braked on opening in this case.

The bumper bracket (with impact absorber) is bolted onto the body structure. It can 
absorb low-speed loads (at least 4 km/h) without body damage. 

The bumper system is designed to meet consumer protection requirements. The con¬ 
sumer protection requirements in the US by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 
(IIHS). Specifically designed deforming elements lead to low repair costs. 


Doors 

For the first time on a four-door BMW, all the doors are frameless. This detail is a clever 
concept on the part of the BMW designers that emphasizes the sporty coupe styling. 

It creates an even flatter, more dynamic contour of the elongated, coupe-style roof line. 
This is a decisive design feature that follows the tradition of a Gran Turismo.

F07 sheet metal shells of the door body 



Large sheet metal door shell structures transfer force to the body and ensure high rigidity 
and component quality despite the low tolerances used. The implementation of very 
deep stamping in the fabrication of the inner door panel structure and the clever use of a 
hinge reinforcement have enable a sophisticated design/contour of the exterior. 

Advantages of the door design: 

• Reduced C02 emissions and increase in the driving dynamics as a result of weight 
saving (28 kg/61.7 lb per vehicle in relation to a comparable steel design) 

• Interior impression alows for an improved sense of space 

• Increase in the light incidence inside the vehicle 

• High form stability of individual parts as a result of one-part construction of the inner 
door panel stamping. 

• Lowest possible number of components for the door structure 

• Laser welding and structure bonding are used in the assembly of the door structure. 

There have been many aluminum door structures at BMW in the past, e.g. on the E52, 
E63, E64. However, they have only been produced in high volumes since the launch of 
the F01. 

The aim of the development of the door structure for the F07 was therefore to implement 
an aluminum door concept that could also be manufactured in greater volume at 
acceptable costs. 

However, it is considerably difficult to manufacture aluminum stamped parts, in particular 
when the material requires deep stamping to form the component, due to the lower 
plasticity of aluminum. 

With the development of a new structure concept with deep stamped sections that are 
used to transfer force, manufacturing feasibility was ensured without having to forego the 
proven metal plate component construction methods.

Roller Sunblind 

Roller sunblinds (SA 416 Rear Sunshades) are available in the rear doors as options for 
the F07. For the first time, an electrically activated roller sunblind is installed for frameless 
doors. 

The roller sunblind has a horizontal bar at the top end. The horizontal bar is attached to a 
telescopic bar that can be extended and retracted by means of an electric motor.

Panoramic Glass Sunroof 

A two-part panoramic glass sunroof with contour is a standard on the F07. The design, 
the materials used and the variability set new standards in this vehicle class. 

The F07 is currently the only vehicle on the market on which the large glass sunroof 
system makes a significant contribution to the overall vehicle rigidity.

The front glass panel in the color “Venus grey” has an opening and lifting function; the 
rear fixed glass element is fixed in the structure. 

The panoramic glass sunroof is a slide / tilt sunroof that runs inwards. The glass panel 
and wind deflector can be moved and are controlled according to the usual BMW slide/ 
tilt sunroof operating logic by means of a switch in the roof function center (FZD): 

• To open the roof: 

Press the switch backwards 

• To close the roof: 

Press the switch forwards 

• Roof in ventilation setting: 

Press the switch upwards 

The operating logic to open the roller sunblind is implemented in the same way as for the 
BMW panoramic glass sunroof. The operating logic corresponds to the direction of 
movement of the components and is thus easy for customers to understand. 

To exclude the risk of possible injury, an anti-trap mechanism is implemented for the 
complete travel path of the glass panel.

Despite a significantly smaller body roof area, the panoramic glass sunroof of the F07 
is 10% longer and wider than the panoramic glass sunroof of the E61. 

The F07 is the first vehicle in which a panoramic glass sunroof of this size could be 
integrated into a coupe-style roof line. The F07 panoramic glass sunroof can be opened 
to a length of up to 440mm/17.3 inches. 

This innovative sliding roof system is made possible by the newly developed roller 
sunblind which takes up very little space in the roofliner when rolled up. 


32 

F07 Complete Vehicle 



































Only the F07 currently offers a side roller sunblind that completely seals off light and 
prevents anyone looking in. This achieves the maximum possible headroom and viewing 
surface. 

The roller sunblind can be opened together with the front glass panel or opened sepa¬ 
rately. It is covered with “Rokona Tokyo” fabric and in different color variants depending 
on the roofliner color. 


Common Part Concept 

The common part concept means that the highest demands can be met at acceptable 
costs. For example, components that are completely identical or components that have 
been only slightly modified are used.

Dashboard 


The dashboard has been given an IMC-PUR spray-on skin. In-mould Coating (IMC) is the 
term used to describe the technology used to make the spray-on skin from polyurethane. 
First, a parting agent is poured into a mould. The layer of paint in colors is then applied. 

A 1 mm thick layer of polyurethane is then applied. The upper part is available in black or 
with a bright interior color. 



The interior color is continued in the bottom section of the dashboard. This area below 
the decorative strip is available in the following colors: 

• Black 

• Everest grey 

• Venetian beige 

• Ivory white 

• Cinnamon brown

For the decorative strips, galvanized accentuating strips represent a significant upgrade. 
The central information display (CID) is also highlighted by accentuating strips at its side. 
The decorative strips are available in matt satin silver as well as in different wood variants, 
including one with open pores. 

The ambient light under the accentuating strips on the decorative strips creates a floating 
effect. In addition, the visual effect of the fresh air grille is enhanced by galvanized frames 
and a clasp inserted in the control knob. For better operation at night, the knurled wheels 
at the center fresh air grille have lighting on the F07. Additional lighting for the knurled 
wheels of the side grilles is included with the SA 4NB (4 zone automatic climate control 
system).

Luggage Compartment 

A new luggage compartment concept of the F07 combines the benefits of a sedan with 
the utility of a wagon. Its versatility and the materials set new standards in this vehicle 
class. 

The vehicle interior can be separated from the luggage compartment (comfort position). 
To increase the capacity, the luggage compartment can be placed in the cargo position 
or the rear-seat backrests can be folded down. 

In the luggage compartment, the carpet surface “satin velour” available in 4 colors. 

Versatility 

The seating comfort in the rear and the luggage compartment capacity can always be 
adapted to individual needs. F07 has as much legroom as in the F01 and the headroom 
and a maximum luggage compartment capacity (with the rear seat bench completely 
folded down) is comparable to the E70.

F07 Complete Vehicle 



























F07 rear seats in normal position and with center armrest folded down, as well as right-hand 
rear seat in the front backrest position 

In the comfort position, the rear-seat backrests can be tilted by up to 33 degrees (40 
degrees with SA 460, comfort seat in the rear, electrical). The luggage compartment 
capacity is 440 liters (15.53 cubic feet). The vehicle interior is separated from the luggage 
compartment by the luggage compartment partition wall behind the seats in every set¬ 
ting. 

If the luggage compartment partition wall is released, it adapts to the setting of the seats, 
enlarging the luggage compartment capacity. If both seats are shifted forwards by a maxi¬ 
mum of 100 mm, the luggage compartment capacity is 590 liters (20.83 cubic feet); 
legroom is then at the comfortable level of the E60. The luggage compartment now has 
sufficient space for e.g. four golf bags (46"), a baby stroller or four pairs of skis (through- 
loading option between the rear seats).

Folding down the rear seats creates a load volume of 1,700 liters (60 cubic feet). This 
enables transport of large or bulky objects, e.g. washing machines, TVs etc., two short 
surfboards, two mountain bikes standing or three mountain bikes lying down. 

Intermediate combinations can also be set. The seat cushion, backrests and luggage 
compartment partition wall are split and can be adjusted individually. 

Depending on requirements, the small or large luggage compartment lid can opened 
for loading.

The luggage compartment can be separated from the vehicle interior using the luggage 
compartment partition wall and the rear window shelf (comfort position). Even if the small 
luggage compartment lid is opened or the backrest angle of the rear seats is changed, in 
the same way as in the sedan neither cold nor noise nor smells from the luggage 
compartment can reach the passengers.

Rear Window Shelf 

The rear window shelf is designed in the same quality and color (“Everest grey” or 
“Oyster”) as the roofliner (continuation of design for roofliner and pillar trim). Design 
measures have been used to protect the critical areas against damage and soiling.

When locked in place, the luggage compartment partition wall behind the seats sepa¬ 
rates the vehicle interior from the luggage compartment. On the passenger side, it has a 
trim panel with the same design as the door trim panels and lower side panels of the C- 
pillar. 


47 

F07 Complete Vehicle 



























If the luggage compartment partition wall has been released, a spring mechanism moves 
it as far forwards as the setting of the seats permits. Shifting the seats in a longitudinal 
direction and changing the backrest angle enables an increase in the luggage compart¬ 
ment capacity. 

Seating comfort remains very high; legroom is in the front seat position is still at the level 
of the E60. 

The luggage compartment partition wall is split into three segments. The width of each of 
the two outer segments corresponds to 40% of the overall width; the width of the middle 
segment accounts for 20%. 

The following variations are possible when folding down: 

• Only right-hand segment 

• Only middle segment 

• Left-hand and middle segment 

• All segments. 

The two outer segments are released by means of operating levers on each of the side 
trim panels in the luggage compartment. The middle segment is released by means of an 
operating lever on the back of the middle segment.

Side Airbag 

The front side airbags are integrated in 
the backrest of the driver's seat and front 
passenger's seat. The back of the seat 
reaches up to the side of the seat. This is 
referred to as a “surrounding seat wall”. 
Triggering of the airbag pushes up the 
side slightly, enabling the airbag to open 
and perform its protective function. 

The front seats are equipped with seat 
occupation detection and seat belt ten¬ 
sioners. 

Unlike the F01/F02, seat belts with elec¬ 
tric motor driven reel are not offered on 
the F07. 



Note: F07 ACSM system is similar to F01 as it incorporates driver/passenger 
front, side and knee airbags as well as left and right curtain airbags as 
standard equipment.

Passenger Airbag Deactivation 

An automatic deactivation of the airbag is provided in compliance with the regulations of 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA. The child seat listed in the 
regulation (for an approximately one-year old child on the front passenger seat) must lead 
to the deactivation of the airbag. The seat occupancy mat is used to classify the occu¬ 
pants for this function. 

The F07 uses a CIS (Capacitive Interior Sensing mat) instead of the Occupant 
Classification 3 mat OC3 used in previous vehicles. The CIS was first introduced to the 
US market with the E89 Z4. 

The CIS mat consists of two elements, a sensor wire, which runs parallel to the seat 
heating in the seat cushion, and an evaluation unit. The CIS mat measures the capacity 
and the ohmic resistance between the sensor wire (anode) and the ground of the vehicle 
(katode) at a frequency of 120 kHz. The CIS mat uses changes in the capacity and the 
resistance to determine whether an adult or a child is in the front passenger seat. 



F07 Measuring procedure of the CIS mat 

The deactivation of the front passenger airbag, side airbag and knee airbag on the front 
passenger side is signalled by the indicator light for the front passenger airbag deactiva¬ 
tion. 

The indicator light for front passenger airbag deactivation in the roof function center is lit 
when a small child is detected in the passenger seat or when the passenger seat is 
unoccupied. 

The brightness of the display is regulated by the automatic regulation of the display 
lighting.

F07 Complete Vehicle 





















Rear Seats 

The rear seats in the F07 are independent seats with comprehensive adjustment 
options. The forward/back seat adjustment can be used to create a cargo position for 
bulky items in the luggage compartment. 

The seats can still be used by the rear-seat passengers with adequate legroom. 

Rear seat features: 

• High flexibility in seat adjustment 

• Very generous amount of space available, in particular knee room 

• Very large thigh support (fatigue-free travel) 

• Distinctive individual seat appearance 

• Comprehensive comfort features (heater, climate, comfort head restraint) 

• Spatial feeling of a sedan with the functionality of a wagon. 

As standard, the F07 is available as a 5-seater or optionally as a 4-seater with two 
individual comfort seats (option): 

• Standard rear seats 

• Rear Comfort seats (SA 460) 

Seat heating can be ordered as special equipment (SA 496). For the rear comfort seat, 
additional active rear seat ventilation (SA 454) is available as part of the ZLU Luxury Rear 
Seating Package.

Rear Seat Ventilation 

For the rear comfort seat (SA 460), active seat ventilation (SA 454) is available as part of 
ZLU Luxury Rear Seating Package. 

The new climate control concept is temperature-controlled, similar to the heating. 
Depending on the surface temperature that is reached, the fan speed - and thus the 
power output of the seat climate control - is regulated. 

With active seat ventilation, the air in the seat is specifically distributed. This is done by 
means of fan mats perforated at defined positions to guide the cool air to the body. 

The cooled air is taken in from the interior in the area of the lower B-pillar. 

Two central fans are installed per seat. These fans draw in cooled interior air through a 
shared box.

IHKA 2 Zone 


IHKA 2 Zones is standard equipment (SA 534). 


IHKA 2 Zones can control the air volume and air 
distribution separately for the left and right side. 

With the IHKA 2 Zones, the current settings of the 
driver for temperature, air volume and air distribu¬ 
tion can be transferred to the passenger side with 
the ALL button. In addition, the IHKA 2 Zones is 
equipped with the Automatic Recirculation 
Control (AUC). With this, the fresh air is cut-off if 
there are odors or pollutants. The interior air is 
then recirculated. 



IHKA 4 Zone 


The IHKA 4 Zone is available as optional 
equipment (SA 4NB) in the F07. 

In the front section of the vehicle, the IHKA 4

Bus Overview 

The Bus structure of the F07 is the same as the F01/F02. 

Changes to the MOST bus 

There is no SDARS or IBOC control units because the CIC now incorporates the 
SDARS (satellite radio) as well as IBOC (digital radio). 

AMPT is now in the place of the Top HiFi but this is mainly a change in terminology. 

Changes to the PT-CAN 

EMA LI and EMA RE control units are not present because the F07 does not have seat 
belts with electric motor reel. 

Changes to the K-CAN 

HiFi Amp is now referred to as AMPH but this is just a change in terminology.

Passive Go 


As on F01 Car Access System forth generation is used in the F07. Thus the integration 
of the complete range of functions of Comfort Access in the Car Access System. 

The F07 also comes with Passive Go (drive authorization system) as standard equip¬ 
ment. The Passive Go drive authorization allows the customer to start the engine without 
active use of the ID transmitter. Due to the Passive Go drive authorization, the vehicle 
does not need an insertion slot. To start the engine, it is adequate if an ID transmitter is 
somewhere in the passenger compartment. 

The ID transmitter is equipped with a battery. The battery lasts about four years. Up to 
eight ID transmitters can be used with the vehicle.

Brake Energy Regeneration 

Brake Energy Regeneration (BER) is a function of the Intelligent Generator Control (IGR) 
The system selectively drives the alternator by using the kinetic energy while braking and 
in coasting mode where it would otherwise be wasted. This provides energy for the elec¬ 
trical system without having to use engine power thus saving fuel. 

In contrast with conventional power management systems, the battery must not be fully 
charged at all times but rather should maintain a charge level that is within certain limits. 
A fully charged battery cannot accept more charge, therefore that condition is avoided by 
the IGR. 

The Brake Energy Regeneration function reguires an intelligent sensor on the negative 
terminal of the battery and a communication interface on the alternator. Vehicles with 
BER must use only AGM gel batteries that withstand the large number of charge cycles. 
When servicing it is important to ensure that the correct type of battery is fitted. 



Brake Energy Regeneration 

No fuel is drawn from the tank (1) in coasting mode or while braking (in other words, when the driver’s foot 
is not on the accelerator). The injectors in the fuel injection system (2) are shut off. The engine (3) is driven 
by the kinetic energy from the wheels. The alternator (4) generates the maximum possible electrical output 
and supplies the electrical equipment (5). The DME (6) is in communication with the alternator and the 
intelligent battery sensor (7), which detects the charge level of the battery (8), and charges the battery with 
the maximum possible voltage. 


67 

F07 Complete Vehicle 



































Brake Energy Regeneration transforms the vehicle’s kinetic energy into electricity, and 
uses this power to charge the battery. As a result, the battery draws less power from the 
engine, and fuel consumption is reduced. 



F07 instrument cluster 


A new feature is the blue indicator in the instrument panel below the tachometer, which 
lights up whenever kinetic energy is converted into electricity (while coasting off the 
accelerator or under braking). The red section of the display below the “P” is the mile 
per gallon gauge. 



Note: This Efficient Dynamics display is also installed in the F01/F02 with 
Brake Energy Regeneration as of September 2009.

N55B30M0 Engine 



The 535i Gran Turismo F07 will be launched to the US market in the Spring of 2010. 
This vehicle uses the N55 engine which is the successor to the N54 engine. Technical 
updates and modifications make it possible to use only one exhaust turbocharger. The 
technical data have remained virtually the same - with reduced costs and improved quality. 

Innovations on the N55 engine: 

• Single exhaust turbocharger (twin scroll type) 

• Air-gap-insulated exhaust manifold six into two 

• Catalytic converter is located closer to engine 

• Direct fuel injection with central injector location, (uses solenoid valve injectors) 

• 3rd generation Valvetronic 

• Engine mounted Digital Engine Electronics (MEVD17.2 Bosch), integrated into 
intake system, FlexRay capability 

• Lightweight-construction crankshaft 

• Characteristic-map-regulated oil pump 

• Uniform single-belt drive across all model series

N63B44O0 Engine 



The N63 engine is the successor to the N62 engine. First introduced with the E71 X6, it 
is the first engine worldwide with an optimized package. In order to achieve the demand¬ 
ing performance targets with an optimal package and weight, the twin exhaust tur¬ 
bochargers and catalytic converters have been placed in the V chamber between the 
cylinder banks, which meant swapping the positions of the intake and exhaust ports. 

The short pipe lengths and large cross-sections mean that this arrangement enables 
minimization of the pressure losses on the intake and exhaust sides. 

Innovations of the N63 engine: 

• Installed in several vehicle model series (E71/E72/F01/F02/F04/F07) 

• Exhaust turbochargers are installed in the engines V chamber 

• Catalytic converters are also in the V chamber (close to the engine) 

• Direct fuel injection with piezo injectors 

• MSD85 engine management system, fluid-cooled with FlexRay connection 

• Indirect charge air intercooling 

• Diagonal torque converter bolting.

Automatic Transmission 


The F07 is available exclusively with an automatic transmission. The new transmissions 
GA8HP45Z and GA8HP70Z will be deployed. 



Highlights of the new eight speed transmission: 

• Enhanced gearshift spontaneity 

• Greater driving and shifting comfort as a result of a closer gear ratio 

• Higher precision control of the converter lockup clutch at low engine loads 

• Higher power transmission of the converter lockup clutch 

• Reduced fuel consumption (-5% to -6%) 

The GA8HP45Z and GA8HP70Z are new developments and will gradually replace the 
established 6-speed automatic transmissions GA6HP19Z TU and GA6HP26Z TU. The 
overall gear ratio has been increased from 6.04 to 7.07; the gear to gear ratios have are 
now closer, thus also reducing the differences in speed when shifting gear. The weight of 
the transmission has been reduced significantly using a plastic oil pan and other light 
weight components. 

The Electronic Transmission Control (EGS) control unit is integrated in the control unit 
framework of the electronic immobilizer EWS. This provides better protection against 
theft. 

Operation is now exclusively via the electronic gear selector switch (GWS). 

78 

F07 Complete Vehicle 





Mechanical torsional vibration clampers of the second generation are deployed in the 
torque converter: 

• Turbine torsional vibration damper, TTD 

• Dual-damper torque converter, ZDW. (used on diesel models) 

The function and structure of the torque converter are described in the “E70 Automatic 
transmission” training material available on TIS and ICR 

The vibration isolation reduces the proportion of slip on the converter lockup clutch and 
enables a larger operating range with the converter lockup clutch closed. This reduces 
the fuel consumption by 5% to 6% in the consumption cycle (KV01) compared to the 
TU 6-speed automatic transmission used until now.

Driveshaft and Axle Shafts 

Driveshaft 

Each engine-transmission configuration uses a steel driveshaft that is specially adapted 
to the individual torque requirement. 

The main focal points in the design of the driveshaft of the F07 were the torque transfer 
and comfort requirements with minimal acoustics and vibrations. 

The joints, shaft divisions and shaft diameters have been specified in such a way that 
they do not pass on any disruptive noises or vibrations to the connection points at the 
body. 

On the F07, the driveshafts are connected to the automatic transmission and rear differ¬ 
entials exclusively by means of flexible discs. This minimizes the high-frequency tooth 
meshing noises on the rear differential.

The driveshaft is divided into two shaft tubes connected at the center mount with a slide 
connection and a universal joint. 

In the event of a frontal impact, the driveshaft absorbs a portion of the crash energy. The 
crash function properties which are integrated in the front drive shaft tube, have been 
optimized. 

The spring force which specifically deforms the front driveshaft tube has been reduced 
once again. The capability to transfer torque has remained unchanged. 


82

Axle Shafts 



The F07 has axle shafts inserted on the wheel and axle differential side. Depending on 
the acoustic and dynamics requirements, different drive shafts are used.

The journal version towards the rear differential depends on the size of the rear 
differential. The journal to the wheel hub is designed in only one size. 

The positioning of the rear differential means the left-hand and right-hand output shafts 
have different overall lengths.

Chassis and Suspension 


The chassis of the F07 is based on that of the F01, which has set new standards for 
driving dynamics and comfort. The chassis of the F07 was adapted to these standards. 

Innovations such as Integral Active Steering, Integrated Chassis Management, Dynamic 
Drive and Electronic Damper Control, which are features of the F01, are also integrated 
in the F07.

Suspension/damping 

Steel springs are standard on the front axle of the F07, air springs on the rear axle. 
Conventional shock absorbers are the standard damping. EDC is included in the optional 
equipment Adaptive Drive (SA2VA) as part of the Sport Package. The EDC is the same 
Vertical Dynamic Control introduced with the E70/E71 and F01/F02. 

The EDC is a sub-function of the Vertical Dynamic Management VDM. The actuator of 
the shock absorbers and the sensors on the shock absorbers, referred to a satellites, are 
connected by means of FlexRay with the VDM control unit. The dynamic drive control 
switch in the center console allows the selection of the damper characteristic, which is 
stored in the VDM control unit. 

The air suspension of the rear axle is also controlled, as in the F01, by the electronic ride 
height control EHC. 

Note: The EDC (VDC) and EHC system are described in the ,, F01/F02" Vertical 
Dynamics Systems training information available on TIS and ICP.

F07 Complete Vehicle 
















The rack-and-pinion power steering familiar from the F01 is used as steering in the F07. 
Servotronic,i.e. a speed dependent steering servo, is installed as standard in the F07. 

The servotronic valve on the steering box is controlled by the Integrated Chassis 
Management. The ICM also controls the electronic volumetric flow adjustment. 

This adjusts the volumetric flow of the power steering pump to the actual requirement. 
This, in turn, leads to a reduction of the fuel consumption and accordingly to a reduction 
of the C02 emissions. 

With the optional equipment Integral Active Steering, the steering gear of the front axle 
is supplemented by a planetary gearbox with override function, which supports a speed 
dependent steering gear ratio. The rear axle is equipped with Integral Active Steering, 
increasing the comfort and the driving dynamics. For detailed information how the 
Integral Active Steering operates, refer to the “F01/F02 Lateral dynamics systems” train¬ 
ing material. The components of Integral Active Steering: Active steering in front and rear 
axle slip angle control cannot be ordered separately, but are only available in a package as 
Integral Active Steering (SA 2VH as part of ZSP Sport Package). 

Note: Run-flat tires are standard equipment on the F07. 

Driving Stability Control Systems 

The driving stability control systems can be distinguished by the direction in which they 
act. DSC systems can act both in and around an axle of the vehicle-specific coordinates 
system X, Y and Z.

Dynamic Stability Control DSC 

DSC prevents the drive wheels from spinning when the vehicle accelerates and drives off. 

DSC also detects unstable driving states such as oversteer or understeer. DSC helps to 
keep the vehicle on a safe course within the limits of physics by reducing the engine 
power and by applying brake interventions on individual wheels. 

Note: The driving style always remains the responsibility of the driver. 

Even DSC is not able to change the laws of physics. 

The numerous individual functions that make up DSC are listed in the following table.

The Integral Active Steering (SA 2VH) increases the dynamic performance of the vehicle 
as well as ride comfort. 

The variable steering gear ratio of the active steering unit reduces the steering effort to 
approximately two turns of the steering wheel to bring the front wheels from stop to stop. 
In a low speed range of around 60 km/h (40mph) the variable steering gear ratio on the 
front axle is coupled with a counter steering angle on the rear axle. This makes the vehicle 
more manoeuverable. 

With increased speed, the steering angle support is delayed. The steering gear ratio 
becomes less direct. At the same time, the steering strategy of the integral active steer¬ 
ing changes. Whereas the steering is counter to the direction of the front axle at low 
speeds, the steering angle is increasingly in the same direction as the front axle at high 
speeds. This has a stabilizing effect on the vehicle.

Electronic Damper Control (EDC) 

With F07, the Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM) is used with the integrated function 
EDC (Electronic Damper Control). In the F01/F02, EDC has also been called VDC 
(Vertical Dynamics Management). The VDC introduced with the E70/E71, was improved 
for the F01/F02 and now further improved for the F07. The actuator of the shock 
absorbers and the sensors on the shock absorbers, i.e. satellites, are connected by 
means of FlexRay with the VDM control unit. EDC / VDC is included in the Adaptive Drive 
package (SA 2VA).

All drive and dynamic drive systems in the F07 are also influenced together by the 
dynamic drive control switch. The operating principle is the same as in the F01. Four 
levels are available in vehicles with Adaptive Drive (SA 2VA). In vehicles without Adaptive 
Drive (SA 2VA) there is no “Comfort” level, i.e. three levels are available. The dynamic 
drive control switch is then labelled “Normal”. Three different modes of DSC can also be 
set. 


The Sport mode can be adjusted with the controller.

Information and Communication 


Car Information Computer 



The CIC Head Unit was introduced for the first time to the US market in fall 2008 with 
the 1 -Series and 3-Series in connection with the Navigation system (SA 609). This fur¬ 
ther development of the Car Communication Computer CCC will now also be used in 
the F07. 

The head unit facilitates a multitude of new possibilities due to its data storage on a large 
80 gigabyte hard disk. 

This device also makes it possible to incorporate a personalized music collection. Music 
files can be converted (ripped) or copied for the music collection on the hard disk. Once 
stored on the CIC's own hard disk, fast access to these music files is possible at any 
time. It is possible to choose from 3700 music files (12 gigabytes). 

In the radio system, the tuner/decoder for the digital radio (IBOC), and the satellite tuner 
(SDARS) are now integrated in the CIC. 

By changing the base plate, the more advanced connection of the music player (SA 
6NF) was realized. This guarantees the connection and playing of the music from the 
music player in a mobile telephone. It is now easy to access the music stored on the 
mobile telephone. Easy menu navigation and playing of this music can now be controlled 
using the iDrive system. 

You can find more information on the Car Information Computer in the “Car Information 
Computer CIC” and “F01/F02 Audio System” training information available on TIS and 
ICR

Note: Navigation (SA609) is standard equipment on the F07 for the US market. 


114 

F07 Complete Vehicle 




























Audio Systems 


The speaker systems in the F07 are offered in two quality levels: 

• Hi-Fi system = Hi-Fi speaker system (SA 676) 

• Top Hi-Fi System = Premium Hi-Fi System (SA 677) 

The Hi-Fi system is the standard equipment. 

An eight channel amplifier with digital equalizing is integrated in the hi-fi system. 
However, only seven of the eight channels are used in the hi-fi system. 

The woofers are located under the front seats. They are each coupled with the side sill. 
This increases the resonance volume that is necessary for bass response. 

The CIC unit can be combined with all amplifier/speaker systems. 

With the Hi-Fi system and Top Hi-Fi system, separate speakers are installed for the high 
and mid-frequency range. 


Even though the speaker of the Hi-Fi system and “Premium” Top Hi-Fi system have the 
same diameter, there are differences in the performance of the speakers. This is achieved 
by using different materials for the membranes, coils and magnets. 


The Top Hi-Fi system supports playing multichannel formats. It is possible to play multi¬ 
channel audio formats via the drive of the CIC or via the 6 X DVD changer. 


The Hi-Fi system consists of twelve speakers; the Top Hi-Fi system has 16 speakers, 
each with different booster amplifiers. 


HiFi System 

The speakers and the amplifier of the Hi-Fi system can be seen in the following picture. 
The tweeters have a diameter of 25 mm. The mid-frequency speakers of the Hi-Fi sys¬ 
tem have a diameter of 100mm. The woofers have a diameter of 217 mm. 

The speakers are driven with an output of 5 x 25 watts for the mid-frequency speakers 
and tweeters and 2 x 40 watts for the woofers.

Top HiFi System 

The speakers and the amplifier of the “Premium” Top Hi-Fi system can be seen in the 
following picture. The tweeters have a diameter of 25 mm. The mid-frequency speakers 
of the Top Hi-Fi system have a diameter of 100 mm. The woofers have a diameter of 217 
mm. The speakers are driven with an output of 7 x 25 watts for the mid-frequency speak¬ 
ers and tweeters and 2x125 watts for the woofers. 

The amplifier of the Top Hi-Fi system in the F07 is equipped with load-logic separation. 
Here the electronics of the amplifier are supplied by and connected to a separate (stable) 
power supply. This is specifically designed to prevent loosing the electronics in the event 
of a voltage dip.

Telephone System 

As already known from the E70 and F01, the F07 also uses the ULF-SBX high interface 
box . The control unit is installed with the 6FL iPod/USB Audio adapter. 

The Telematic Control Unit (TCU), which is known from the E70, is installed to perform 
the telephone functions (SA 639) as well as BMW ASSIST (SA 633) functions. 

A pairing assistant is also integrated in the F07 to help customers to pair their mobile 
phones. 

You can find more information on the telephone systems and their functions in the 
“F01/F02Telephone Systems” and “Car Information Computer” Training Information 
available on TIS and ICR 

Note: The specified range of functions can only be achieved with Bluetooth- 
compatible mobile phones recommended by BMW. A list of the current 
recommended Bluetooth-compatible mobile phones can be retrieved 
using the Aftersales Assistance Portal (ASAP) or at 
http://www.bmw.com/bluetooth/. 

The following control units serve as interfaces between the mobile telephone and vehicle: 

• Universal charger and hands-free unit, interface box ULF-SBX High (USB inter¬ 
face/audio interface) 

• Telematic Control Unit TCU.
