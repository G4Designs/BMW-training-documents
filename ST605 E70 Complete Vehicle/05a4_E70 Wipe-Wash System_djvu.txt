E70 Wipe/wash System 



Introduction 


The E70 is equipped with two Windshield wipers and one rear window wiper as 
standard. 

The wiperfunction is possible in the following modes: 

• Intermittent wipe 

• Continuous wipe in Stage 1 

• Continuous wipe in Stage 2 

• Flick wipe 

The E70 can be optionally equipped with headlight washer system option 502. 

It is equipped with rain/driving lights/solar sensor and heated nozzles as standard. 

The wipe/wash system on the E70 is a conventional wipe/wash system. 

This means that the wiper motors are equipped with a reset contact.

Rain/Driving Lights/Solar Sensor 

A new rain/driving lights/solar sensor is used on the E70. What is actually new is the fact 
that the solar sensor has been integrated in the rain/driving lights/solar sensor. The func¬ 
tionality of the rain sensor and of the driving lights sensor has been retained in full. This 
means the driver is still assisted in that the rain sensor automatically initiates the proce¬ 
dure for switching on the Windshield wipers. 

The driving lights sensor supplies the ON signal forthe driving lights control function. 
Under unfavorable light conditions such as twilight or when driving through a tunnel, 
the ON signal ensures the driving lights are switched on automatically. The solar sensor 
makes sure the automatic climate control system provides optimum air conditioning 
distribution in the vehicle.

trol unit (2) executes the functions of the wipe/wash system. The junction box control 
unit also switches the washerfluid pumps (6 or 7) on or off. On vehicles equipped with 
the driving lights control function, the junction box control unit receivers the information 
to switch the wipe/wash system on and off from the rain/driving lights/solar sensor (11).

The signal produced when the wiper switch on the steering column stalk (12) is operated 
is sent from the steering column switch cluster SZL (13) via the chassis CAN to the 
dynamic stability control DSC (4). The dynamic stability control transfers the signal on to 
the PT-CAN.The junction box control unit (9) switches on the wiper motor (17), for 
instance, and monitors its operation. 

The junction box control unit switches the washerfluid pumps (6 to 8) on or off. 

On vehicles equipped with the driving lights control function, the rain-driving lights-solar 
sensor (16) sends, for example, the request to switch on the wiper motor (17) via the LIN 
bus. The roof functions center (15) makes the request available on the K-CAN. In this 
way, the junction box control unit receives the information to switch the wiper motor on 
or off. 

The wipe function is dependent on the driving speed. The speed signal is made available 
by the dynamic stability control (4) via the PT-C AN.

Control Units 


J unction Box 

The junction box control unit is the masterforall wiperfunctions. 

The relays forthe wipe/wash functions are integrated in the front power distribution box. 

The relay forthe continuous wipe function in Stage 1 is plugged in and the relay for 
Stage 2 soldered. 

A relay each is installed in the power distribution boxfor wiping the rear window and for 
the headlight washer system. 

Roof Functions Center 

The RLSS is connected to the K-CAN via the roof functions center. 


Dynamic Stability Control 

The dynamic stability control makes available the driving speed signal and is the interface 
to the steering column switch cluster SZL. 


Rain/Driving Lights/Solar Sensor 

The rain/driving lights/solar sensor consists ofthree sensors. These sensors are: 

• Rain sensor - Signal forthe wipe/wash system 

• Driving lights sensor - Signal for switching driving lights on and off 

• Solar sensor- Signal forthe air conditioning system.

Rain Sensor 

With the aid of three infrared transmit diodes and infrared receive diodes, the rain sensor 
evaluates the moisture level on the Windshield. 

Three rain ranges are created by combining infrared transmit diodes and infrared receive 
diodes in pairs. The rain ranges are used to determine the rain intensity. 

Rain detection is based on the reflection of the infrared light at the boundary surface from 
the glass of the Windshield to air. The reflection is dependent on the level of soiling and 
moisture on the Windshield. 



Rain range of rain sensor E70 



The infrared light is reflected in full when the 
Windshield is clean and dry. 

The reflection of the infrared light is reduced 
by dirt or rain water on the Windshield. 

The rain sensor signals the detected rain sit¬ 
uation to the roof functions centervia the 
LIN-bus. In turn, the roof functions center 
transfers the information on the K-CAN. In 
this way, the junction box control unit receives 
the requestto switch the Windshield wiper on 
or off. 



The signals are: 

• Sensorstatus 

• Rain intensity 

• Wiperspeed 

• Interval period

Driving Lights Sensor 

The driving lights sensor registers the ambient light and the light levels in front of the 
vehicle (front end). A sensorforeach of these areas is integrated in the rain/driving 
lights/solar sensor. 

The rain/driving lights/solar sensor informs the roof functions center of the driving lights 
situation via the LIN-bus, i.e. driving lights on/off and reason for switching on. 

The roof functions center packs the signals into the corresponding K-CAN telegram and 
sends it. In this way, the footwell module receives the request to switch the driving lights 
on or off (when the automatic driving lights function is active). 

The signals are: 

• Status of driving lights sensor 

• Status of driving lights 

• Ambient brightness level 

• Reason for switching on.

SolarSensor 

The solar sensoris assigned purely to the scope offunctions ofthe automatic heating 
and air conditioning system. 

The solar sensor measures the angle of solar radiation (insolation) on to the vehicle. 

The solar radiation is measured separately on the driver's and front passenger's side. 

At times the solar radiation comes from the front, from the side or sometimes from the 
rear due to the changes in direction while driving. The sensorthere- 
fore registers the solar radiation at all times. 

Persons in the vehicle are subjected to these changing levels 
of solar radiation (insolation). Consequently, more heat is felt 
in the area of solar radiation than in the area with no solar 
radiation. 

The solar sensor measures the solar radiation on to 
the vehicle depending on the position ofthe car 
with respect to the sun. 

The values from the solar enable the integrated 
automatic heating and air conditioning system (cli¬ 
mate control) to respond accordingly and create a 
pleasant climate in the vehicle. The roof functions 
center receives the values from the solar sensor 
via the LIN-bus and forwards the values on the K- 
CAN to the integrated automatic heating and air 
conditioning system (climate control). 

RLSS Variants 

Two versions ofthe rain/driving lights/solar sensor are used in the E70. The version 
depends on whether a head-up display is installed in the vehicle or not. The optics in 
the front end light sensorthat are pervious to infrared light are replaced by clear optics 
forthe head-up display. 

The front end light sensor is directed at the area ofthe road which is also used forthe 
head-up display. The brightness level ofthe representation in the head-up display can 
thus be adapted to the light situation. 

This is necessary for example when driving through a tunnel with the head-up display 
switched on. 

Installation ofthe rain/driving lights/solar sensor in the E70 requires the installation ofthe 
roof functions center with maximum equipment configuration. Consequently, the maxi¬ 
mum equipment configuration ofthe interior lighting system is also installed. 

Note: The rain/driving lights/solarsensorcan best be distinguished simply by 
looking atthe Windshield. If the rain/driving lights/solar sensor has two 
clear lenses then it is forthe head-up display.

Three variants of the cover cap on the base of the interior rear-view mirror are possible. 

• Cover without rain/driving lights/solar sensor 

• Cover with rain/driving lights/solar sensor 

• Cover with rain/driving lights/solar sensor and high beam assistant. 

The optical element and the electronics of the rain/driving lights/solar sensor can be 
replaced separately. 

Note: An exception is the rain/driving lights/solarsensorforthe head-up 
display. This rain/driving lights/solar sensor can be replaced only as a 
complete unit. The reason forthis is that the optical element and the 
electronics need to be matched (calibrated) in the sensorforthe 
head-up display. This is currently possible only as part of the 
rain/driving lights/solar sensor manufacturing process. 

The occurrence of small bubbles on the silicon gel layer (adhesive layer) is OK (permitted) 
when replacing the optical element. Please rememberto initialize the rain/driving 
lights/solar sensor. 

Wiper Switch 

The wiper switch with the following functions is located in the steering column switch 
cluster: 

• Intermittent wipe 

• Stage 1 and Stage 2 

• Rear window wipe 

• Windshield washer 

• Rearwindow wash 

• Switch for rain/driving lights/solar sensor 

• Indicatorfor active rain/driving lights/solar sensor 

The wiperswitch is designed as an optical switch.The functions of the optical switch are 
described in the section entitled "Steering column switch cluster". 

The interval switch is a four-stage switch. 

Each stage switch produces different input values in the steering column switch cluster 
SZL.The input values are evaluated, for example, for setting the sensitivity of the rain/dri¬ 
ving lights/solar sensor. 

The button forthe rain/driving lights/solar sensor is designed as aground-switching but¬ 
ton. It is required to switch on the rain/driving lights/solar sensor. The LED is illuminated 
when the rain/driving lights/solar sensor is activated.

E70 Wipe/wash System 




Front Wiper Motor 

The front wiper motor is designed fortwo speed stages and has a reset contact. 

RearWiperMotor 

The rear wiper motor also features a reset contact and has one sped stage. 

The purpose of the reset contact is to detect the parked (rest) position of the wiper blade. 

Pump for Windshield Washer 

The washerfluid pumps for washing the Windshield and rearwindow are mounted on the 
washerfluid reservoir. These two pumps are driven directly by the junction box control 
unit. 

Pump for Headlight Washer 

A high pressure pump is used for the headlight washer system. The pump is activated via 
a relay in the front power distribution box. 

Heated WaterJ ets 

Two heated water jets are used forthe Windshield washer. The water jets feature a PTC 
resistor that limits the current intake itself.

Principles of Operation 


The wiper/washer system is switched on and off with the wiper switch. The wiper switch 
is an integral part of the steering column switch cluster SZL. 

Wiper Switch 

The following functions are switched on with the wiper switch: 

• Intermittent wipe without the rain/driving lights/solar sensor 

• Automatic wipe with rain/driving lights/solar sensor 

• Continuous wipe, Stage 1 

• Continuous wipe, Stage 2 

• Flick wipe 

• Wash Windshield 

• Wipe rear window 

• Wash rear window 

The signals of the wipe switch are sent from the steering column switch cluster via the 
F-CAN to the dynamic stability control. The signal is then transferred from the dynamic 
stability control via the PT-CAN to the junction box control unit. The junction box control 
unit evaluates the signals and activates the wiper motor accordingly. The junction box 
control unit detects the rest position (park position) of the wiper by means of the reset 
contact in the wiper motor. 

Windshield Wipe Function 

The following functions are available forwiping the Windshield: 

• Intermittent wipe in stages 

• Automatic intermittent wipe 

• Continuous wipe, Stage 1 

• Continuous wipe, Stage 2 

• Flick wipe 

Intermittent Wipe 

The interval can be set with the multi-stage switch. Four intermittent wipe stages are 
available. T he time intervals depend on the set intermittent wipe stage and the vehicle 
speed. The junction box control unit calculates the time intervals and drives the wiper 
motor accordingly. 


16 

E70 Wipe/wash System 





Automatic Intermittent Wipe 

The automatic wipe function is activated by pressing the axial button at "terminal R ON". 

When active, the "automatic wipe" function is indicated by the LED on the wiperswitch. 

A one-off wipe function (acknowledgement wipe) is additionally started. The acknowl¬ 
edgement wipe is also initiated when the wipe interval is increased by means of the wiper 
stage switch but not when the wipe interval is decreased. 

The rain/driving lights/solar sensor makes available the wipe request corresponding to the 
rain intensity. The roof functions center evaluates the signal from the rain/driving 
lights/solar sensor within 20 ms, transfers the relevant signal values to the corresponding 
K-CAN telegram and send it cyclically (RLSS signal values unchanged) or event- 
controlled (RLSS signal values changed). 

The junction box control unit evaluates the request K-CAN telegram (WIPER SPEED) and 
activates the wiper motor. In the automatic wipe function, the wipe speed depends on the 
information from the rain/driving lights/solar sensor, i.e. continuous wipe stage 1 or stage 
2 may be initiated depending on the rain intensity. 

Continuous Wipe, Stage 1 

The wipe motor runs at normal speed when Stage 1 is switched on with the wiper 
switch. The wiper motor switches from continuous wipe in Stage 1 to intermittent wipe if 
the vehicle speed is reduced down to standstill. 

The continuous wipe function in Stage 1 resumes as soon as the vehicle speed is higher 
than 4 km/h. 

The reset (switch-back) of the wiper stage when the vehicle is stationary can be decoded. 

In this case, the wiper blades operate in continuous wipe Stage 1 mode also when the 
vehicle is stationary.

Continuous Wipe, Stage 2 

The wiper blades are moved at double the speed in continuous wipe Stage 2. When the 
vehicle is stationary, continuous wipe Stage 2 automatically switched back to continuous 
wipe Stage l.The wiper blades then move at normal speed. Stage 2 is resumed again at 
a speed in excess of 4 km/h. 

The wipe function switches back to Stage 1 at a speed in excess of 210 km/h. Stage 2 is 
switched on again at a speed below 205 km/h. 

The reset of the wiper stages when the vehicle is stationary can be decoded. In this case, 
continuous wipe Stage 2 is retained also when the vehicle is stationary.

By pressing down the wiperswitch, the Single wipe function is triggered for as long as 
the switch is pressed. On releasing the wiperswitch, the wiper movement is completed 
to the park position of the wiper blades. 


18 

E70 Wipe/wash System 













Rear Window Wipe Function 

The rear window wipe function is switched on with the wiper switch by pressing the stalk 
forward. The control of the rear window wiper is integrated in the junction box control unit. 

The rear window wiperfeatures the following functions: 

• Intermittent wipe 

• Continuous wipe 

Intermittent Wipe 

The intermittent wipe function of the rear window wiper is started by pressing the wiper 
switch forward. The optical signal from the steering column switch is evaluated by the 
steering column switch cluster. The steering column switch cluster sends the signal on 
the F-CAN to the dynamic stability control. 

From the dynamic stability control, the signal is made available on the PT-CAN.The junc¬ 
tion box receives the signal and correspondingly activates the rear window wiper. The 
junction box control unit detects the rest position (park position) of the rear window wiper 
by means of the reset contact in the wiper motor. 

Continuous Wipe 

The rear window wiper switches overto continuous wipe when reverse gear is engaged. 
Operation of the rear window wiper is not stopped when the rear hatch is opened. 

Front and Rear Antiblocking Function 

The Windshield wipers and the rear window wiperfeature the antiblocking function which 
is integrated in the junction box control unit. If the signal is not sent from the reset contact 
while the wiper motor is running, this is interpreted as a blocking situation. 

The junction box control unit evaluates the signal from the reset contact for the antiblock¬ 
ing function. The junction box control unit switches off the blocking motor. A further 
attempt can be made to switch on the wiper. If the wiper blocks again, it will no longer be 
operative for approximately. 3 minutes. The wiper inhibit is cancelled by changing from 
"terminal R ON" to "terminal R OFF" and "terminal R ON".The wipermustthen be 
switched on again. 

Wash Functions 

The E70 has a wash function forthe Windshield and the rear window. The function is 
operated via the wiper switch. 

Wash Windshield 

On pulling the wiper switch, initially the washerfluid pump is switched on followed by the 
Windshield wiper. The washerfluid pump remains switched on for as long as the wiper 
switch is pulled. 


19 

E70 Wipe/wash System 



The signal is routed from the steering column switch clusterto the junction box control 
unit. The junction box control unit activates the washerfluid pump directly. 

Afterthe pump is switched off, the wipers continue to operate for several wipe cycles in 
orderto wipe the Windshield dry. The wipe function set before the Windshield wash cycle 
is continued afterthe Windshield has been washed. 

The junction box control unitwill no longer drive the washerfluid pump if the fluid level in 
the washerfluid reservoir is too low. The junction box control unit receives the information 
necessary for this purpose from the washerfluid level sensor. 

WasherFluid Level Sensor 

The junction box control unit monitors the washerfluid level sensor as from "terminal R 
ON". The washerfluid level sensor switches to ground. 

The junction box control unit receives a low signal when the washerfluid reservoir is full. 
The switch opens when the fluid level in the washerfluid reservoir drops below a certain 
level. The low signal changes to a high signal. The junction box control unit consequently 
generates a message indicating the low level in the washerfluid reservoir. 

Rear Window Wash Function 

The rear window wash function is started by pressing the wiper switch forward. Initially, 
the washerfluid pump forthe rear window is activated, followed by the rear window wiper 
switching on. The wipe function set before the start of the wash cycle and afterthe end 
of the wash function is continued again. 

Terminal 50 

The washerfunction is interrupted or not at all started while the vehicle is started. 

If the Windshield washerfunction was interrupted, the started function is continued after 
the vehicle start procedure has been completed. 

Headlight Washer System 

The headlight washer system is switched on during the first wash cycle after "terminal R 
ON" and "lights ON". Activation is then suppressed for 7 minutes. The headlight washer 
system is activated if the Windshield washer system is operated 5 times within the 7 min¬ 
utes. 

In response to the request from the junction box control unit, the headlight washer sys¬ 
tem is switched on by means of a relay in the junction box. 

The headlight washer system is no longer activated if the washerfluid level in the washer 
fluid reservoir is too low. The junction box control unit receives the corresponding signal 
from the washerfluid level sensor. 

The headlight washer system is also not activated when blocking of the wipers is detect¬ 
ed.

Service Information 


Emergency Operating Functions 

SZL Failure 

The wipers can no longer be operated in the event of the steering column switch cluster 
failing ora break in the bus connection. The junction box control unit switches to emer¬ 
gency operating mode and the Windshield wipers are switched on in Stage 1 setting. 

RLSS Failure 

If there is a fault in the rain/driving lights/solar sensor or it fails completely, the junction 
box control unit takes over control of the wipe/wash system and assumes emergency 
operating mode. Emergency operating mode is an intermittent wipe function that is 
dependent on the vehicle speed. 

Replacing the RLSS 

The following steps are necessary after replacing the sensor: 

• Encode rain/driving lights/solar sensor 

• Clearfault code memory 

• Initialize rain/driving lights/solar sensor.
