History of Vertical Dynamics 


If we were to break down the common dynamic driving systems of today into the three 
coordinate axes by their principle of operation and assign them according to their 
function, BMW vehicles would have three different systems that would belong to the 
vertical dynamics systems. 

Vertical dynamics systems (effective direction mainly along the z-axis or vertical axis) 

• VDC/EDC - Vertical Dynamics Control (Electronic Damper Control) 

• EHC - Electronic Height Control 

• ARS - Active Roll Stabilization (or Dynamic Drive) 

EDC 

An EDC was firstfitted to a BMW in 1987, in the 
BMWE30M3. EDC I was firstfitted in series 
production in 1987 in the E32 (7 Series, 750i), 
which was based on the premise of manual toggling 
between a comfort and sports suspension setting. 

EDC II was then introduced in the E24 (6 Series). 

Even at this early stage of development, EDC 
functioned with characteristic curve mapping. 

Then in 1990, EDC III was fitted in the series 
production of the E31, E38 and E39. A modified 
form ofthis system, EDC-K, was also laterto be 
found in the E65. 

System Description 

Chassis designs should be able to offerthe driver 
(and occupants) the best possible standards in 
driving comfort, a very high level of driving safety, 
high agility and easy handling. 

Conventional, non-adjustable vibration dampers are 
only able to achieve a compromise between these 
objectives. 

The electronically controlled dampersystem was 
developed to practically eliminate this conflict of 
objectives. 

BMW EDC-K is a fully-automatic system that 
continually adjusts the damper settings to the 
current driving situation. 





5 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 










The fundamental difference between EDC-K and EDC III is the design of the EDC valves 
and their control logic. EDC-K thus improves driving comfort without impairing driving 
safety. If the damper settings are too soft or comfortable, the vehicle will quickly begin to 
vibrate on unfavorable road conditions. 

EDC-K remains in the soft damper setting for as long as possible and only changes 
immediately to the harder setting when the road situation requires it. 

The system also guarantees consistently good vibration damping characteristics however 
the vehicle is laden. In addition, all vehicle movements which have an effect on vehicle 
handling are monitored constantly by sensors. All measurement results are analyzed by a 
microprocessor and appropriate control commands are transferred to the dampers. 

The damping force at the damper is adjusted by solenoid valves with infinite variability in 
line with the changing road surface conditions, load status and handling characteristics. 

EHC 

It all began for BMW with level control systems, which were available for the 7 Series 
(E23/E32), 6 Series (E24) and 5 Series (E28) as option or, in some vehicles, as part of the 
standard equipment. 

A distinction was made between: 

• Hydro-pneumatic suspension 

• Self-levelling suspension with electrohydraulic pump 

• Self-levelling suspension with engine driven piston pump 

• Single-axle air suspension 

• Twin-axle air suspension 

The purpose of a level control system is to maintain the height of the vehicle body as 
close as possible to a predefined level under all load conditions. Through a constant level 
of the body mainly the driving quality (e.g. camber, toe-in) will remain unaltered in the 
event of changes in payload. 

With the E39, the entire rear-axle load was supported by a single-axle air suspension for 
the first time. This system was controlled automatically under all operating states and 
thus did not permit any intervention by the driver. 

With the X5 (E53), the single-axle air suspension system was taken from the E39 and 
adapted accordingly. In addition, E53 customers were given the opportunity to order a 
twin-axle air suspension system fortheir vehicle. 

The twin-axle air suspension and its scope for adjustment by the driver has particular 
advantages by comparison with the single axle air suspension, especially as regards off 
road handling. Lowering the entire body makes it easierto get into and out of the 
vehicle and facilitates loading and unloading. 

6

ARS 

The customer-friendly name forthe option is "Dynamic Drive" and was first available in 
the 7 Series with the E65. The Dynamic Drive in the E60 is the same as the Dynamic 
Drive in the E65. 

As the vehicle drives through a bend, a rolling moment builds up about the vehicle's roll 
axis (x-axis) due to the centrifugal force that acts on the center of gravity of the vehicle. 
This momenttilts the vehicle body towards the wheel on the outside of the bend, causing 
the vehicle to rapidly approach its dynamic limits. The tilting of the body and the accom¬ 
panying shift in wheel load differences are counteracted by the use of anti-roll bars. 

• Conventional anti-roll bar - During cornering, the wheel suspension on the out¬ 
side of the bend is compressed and the wheel suspension on the inside ofthe bend 
rebounds. This has a twisting effect on the anti-roll bar (torsion). The forces arising 
in the bearing points ofthe anti-roll bar produce a moment that counteracts the tilt¬ 
ing ofthe body. The effect is to improve the distribution of loads acting on both 
wheels on the same axle. 

A disadvantage of a passive anti-roll bar is that the basic suspension tuning hardens 
when the suspension is compressed on one side ofthe vehicle during straight 
ahead travel.This results in a reduction in comfort. 

• Active anti-roll bar -The Dynamic Drive active chassis system also known as 
Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) - is a revolutionary step in chassis and suspension 
engineering. Forthe firsttime, the trade-off between handling/agility and comfort is 
largely eliminated. This results in a new type of "driving pleasure" typical of BMW. 

Dynamic Drive has two active anti-roll bars, which have a positive influence on body 
roll and handling characteristics. The fundamental feature of Dynamic Drive is the 
divided anti-roll bars on each axle. The two halves ofthe anti-roll bars are connected 
by a hydraulic oscillating motor. 

One half of the anti-roll bar is connected to the shaft ofthe oscillating motor, the 
otherto the housing ofthe oscillating motor.These active anti-roll bars control stabi¬ 
lizing moments: 

• which reduce the reciprocal movement ofthe vehicle body, 

• which make it possible to achieve high levels of agility and target precision 
over the entire road speed range, 

• and produce optimum self-steering characteristics. 

During straight-ahead travel, the system improves suspension comfort because the 
anti-roll bar halves are de-coupled, with the effect that the basic suspension tuning does 
not additionally harden when the suspension on one side is compressed.

Adaptive Drive 

What is "Adaptive Drive"? 

With the Adaptive Drive option in the E70, Dynamic Drive active roll stabilization (ARS) 
and the variable damper adjustment (VDC) are functionally linked for the first time. 

The integration of both systems provides maximum safety, comfort and agility beyond 
compare for an SAV (Sports Activity Vehicle). 

Adaptive Drive reduces lateral roll of the body, which normally occurs during high-speed 
cornering or in the event of rapid swerving. Adaptive Drive also reduces the required 
steering angle and improves ride comfort coupled with an increase in driving dynamics. 

The customer can choose between a normal and a sporty basic setting. Adaptive Drive 
means increased driving pleasure and less tiring driving. Unpleasant pitching and lateral 
rolling of the body are diminished or eliminated entirely. The self-steering and load trans¬ 
fer characteristics of the vehicle are significantly improved. 

The reciprocal movements in the upper part of the body, which are inherent in the design 
of SAV vehicles, are considerably reduced. The vehicle can be driven with higher levels 
of precision and agility. The system also contributes to shorter braking distances. 

General Information 

Due to specific dynamic influences acting on the vehicle while it is in motion, the body is 
prone to self-movements, which can be divided into and illustrated by three categories. 

These degrees of freedom can be defined by basing the categories on the mathematics 
coordinate system with its three spatial coordinate axes. 

• Longitudinal dynamics - The main direction of motion - the direction of travel - is 
defined by the x- or longitudinal - axis. Longitudinal dynamic driving states, such as 
acceleration or braking, result in a pitching of the vehicle, which is where the vehicle 
is subjected to motion about the y axis. 

• Lateral dynamics - Lateral dynamics is where the direction of motion is along the 
y- or lateral - axis, e.g. as a result of steering or swerving, and the vehicle exhibits 
movement about the x-axis in the form of a rolling motion. 

• Vertical dynamics - Vertical dynamics is where the vehicle body moves along the 
z - or vertical - axis and the raising and lowering ofthe body, e.g. on bumpy roads, 
are described as vertical strokes. 

Movement ofthe vehicle about the z or vertical axis is known as yaw. Movements 
such as these occur during under or oversteering and are also commonly described 
as sporty drifting.

System Functions 


Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) 

Physical Conditions 

When the vehicle drives through a bend, the vehicle is subjected to lateral acceleration 
[ay], which acts on the vehicle's center of gravity [1], The vehicle body rolls about the 
roll axis [2] due to the kinematics of the front and rear axle. The roll angle is formed, (max. 
5°). This produces a maximum change in level on the wheel arch of 10 cm.

In a passive vehicle with conventional suspension, the rolling moment [M ] is absorbed 
by the anti-roll bars and springs. The springs on the outside of the bend are com¬ 
pressed and the springs on the inside of the bend rebound. In addition, the anti-roll bars 
rotate. A roll angle [.] forms between the vertical and the body. 

In a vehicle with Adaptive Drive, the rolling moment [M ] can be fully compensated for by 
the active anti-roll bars up to a specific rate of lateral acceleration ay. A roll angle only 
begins to form once the rolling moment [M ] has exceeded the moment [M a] actively set 
by the anti-roll bar. The residual rolling moment [M] is then absorbed by the passive 
springs. 


24 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 




















The active body moments [M a] at the front and rear axle counteract the rolling moment 
[M ]. Using this approach, the roll angle is compensated for in accordance with the 
characteristic curve specified in the control unit. The roll angle is fully compensated for 
up to a lateral acceleration of approximately 5 m/s 2 (0.5 g). 

A roll angle can form even with Adaptive Drive, but only at higher rates of lateral accelera¬ 
tion. The roll angle together with an increasing understeering trend therefore provide the 
driver with an indication that the vehicle is approaching its limit range. 

There is no compensation fortire compression caused by the rolling moment [M ]. 



The roll angle shown is achieved when the vehicle is unladen and the driver is in the 
vehicle. When the vehicle is fully laden, the larger body mass effects a greater lateral 
force on the vehicle. Depending on the arrangement of the vehicle load (inside the 
vehicle or on the roof), there may also be a change in leverage [h]. 

The vehicle will then exhibit a somewhat larger roll angle than is shown in the control 
characteristic curve. A fully laden passive vehicle still forms a larger roll angle. 

The distribution of the active body torque between the front and rear axle depends on 
the road speed. 


25 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 




















Affect of the Self-steering Behavior 

The self-steering behavior can be decisively influenced by the distribution of the stabiliz¬ 
ing torque on the axles. The greaterthe stabilizing torque on an axle, the lowerthe lateral 
forces transmitted on this axle. 

Two cases are described below with different distributions of stabilizing moments at the 
axles: 

1. Identical stabilizing torque on both axles 

Handling is NEUTRAL. The front wheels can apply about the same amount of lateral 
force on the road as the rear wheels without drive torque. The handling conditions are 
neutral. 

A vehicle which is tuned to neutral handling conditions provides very agile handling, the 
steering reacts very quickly. The driver experiences precise handling. 

Even an inexperienced driver can control a vehicle which is tuned to neutral handling very 
well at low speeds. 

2. Larger stabilizing torque on the front axle 

Handling is UNDERSTEERING. The front axle wheels cannot apply the same amount of 
lateral force on the road as the rear axle wheels. The vehicle suffers understeer. 

A greater steering-wheel angle is required to be able to follow the desired course. 

An understeering vehicle can generally be well controlled even by an inexperienced driver 
at higherspeeds and higher cornering speeds. This very sensitive handling reduces the 
vehicle's agility. 

Adaptive Drive adjusts the stabilizing moments at the front and rear axles in such a way 
that different handling characteristics are produced for low and high speeds.

27 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 































The passive vehicle is configured as slightly understeering irrespective of the speed 
range. 

Adaptive Drive is tuned to be neutral in the lower road speed range. The driver does not 
have to steer as much to drive through the same bend. This results in optimum handling 
and agility. 

In the upper speed range, both vehicles behave almost identically with regard to the 
required steering angle on the same bend. 

The hydro-mechanical concept is designed so that a greater active stabilizing torque 
cannot occur on the rear axle than on the front axle under any circumstances. This means 
that mechanically and hydraulically the vehicle with Adaptive Drive is safeguarded such 
that no oversteering and therefore for normal customers no critical handling characteris¬ 
tics can occur under any circumstances. 

System Dynamics 

Adaptive Drive has to respond as fast as is required in the event of rapid lane changes, 
rapid cornering or rapid changes of direction on winding country roads. 


The system dynamics of Adaptive Drive are determined by the duration of the following 
stages: 


Process 

Time 

Signal detection by sensor, processing of sensor signals in the control 
unit, valve control 

Approximately 10 milliseconds 

Change of direction, reversal of moment direction, directional valve 

Approximately 30 milliseconds 

Pressure increase (force per wheel) 

0 - >30 bar(0 - >350 N) 

0 - >160 bar(0- >2100 N) 

Approximately 120 milliseconds 

Approximately 400 milliseconds 


Comparison between the conventional stabilizerbarand the active stabilizer bar 

Active stabilizer bars introduce fewer comfort reducing forces into the body than passive 
stabilizer bars. In this case a differentiation must be made depending on the frequency 
with which the forces were introduced. 


Road stimulus 

Anti-roll bar behavior 

At approximately 1 Hz (natural body frequency) 

With smaller strokes, the active anti-roll bartwists 
more easily than a conventional anti-roll bar 

The forces introduced into the body are reduced, 
the vehicle becomes more comfortable and body 
displacement is reduced 

From 8 Hz (wheel natural frequency) 

Both anti-roll bars behave in a similar way. On a vehi¬ 
cle with an active stabilizer bar this is because the 
fluid is not displaced so quickly. 


28 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 





















Operating States 
Straight-ahead Travel 

When the engine is started, the pump delivers hydraulic fluid to the system and a back 
pressure builds up. The pressure difference of approximately 1 bar which exists between 
the chambers of the control motor is very small and has no effect on the anti-roll bar. 

The pressure valves forthe front-axle anti-roll bar(PVV) and rear-axle anti-roll bar(PVH) 
are not supplied with current and are therefore open. The hydraulic fluid can flow back 
into the hydraulic-fluid reservoir directly. This condition remains unchanged as long as 
the vehicle is travelling straight ahead. 

The system function is displayed continuously up to 15 km/h. The full stabilization poten¬ 
tial is available from 15 km/h onwards. 

Cornering 

As the vehicle enters a bend, the signals from the lateral acceleration sensor are sent to 
the ARS control unit. The control unit now sends a pulse-width-modulated signal (PWM) 
to the pressure valves forthe front and rear-axle anti-roll bars. The strongerthe lateral 
acceleration, the greaterthe signal will be (current). The strongerthe current supplied to 
the valve, the more the valve closes and the higherthe pressure which builds up in the 
anti-roll bars. The pressures at the anti-roll bars are detected by pressure sensors [10, 
11] and sent to the control unit. 

Direction valve [9] is controlled by the control unit to increase and maintain pressure suit¬ 
able to the characteristic of the bend (left or right hand bend). A sensor [8] detects the 
switch position of the direction valve. 

Restricted Function 

If a fault is detected, the system enters failsafe mode. The control unit stores the fault in 
the fault memory and displays the failsafe condition in the instrument cluster. Failsafe 
condition is retained until start-up is completed without a fault. 

Failsafe valve [7] is closed by a spring in the event of a system malfunction. The hydraulic 
fluid in the front anti-roll bar is sealed in, thereby ensuring sufficient stabilization and an 
understeering effect equivalent to that of a conventional chassis. 

External leakage: 

External leakage is detected by the front and rear pressure sensors and results in the total 
failure of the system. The failsafe situation is shown in the following hydraulic circuit 
diagram overview.

Vertical Dynamics Control (VDC) 


General Information 

The Vertical Dynamics Control (VDC) system being introduced forthe time from SOP 
with the E70 is a component of the Adaptive Drive equipment package and is an 
advancement of the EDC-K already fitted on the E65. Like EDC-K, VDC is notable for its 
continually adjustable dampers whereby, within certain limits, as many damping charac¬ 
teristic curves (damping force - piston speed) as desired can be plotted. The characteris¬ 
tic curve used depends on the driving situation, in other words, the variables that 
describe the dynamic driving state of the vehicle and which are selected automatically at 
the driver's command.

Objectives oftheVDC System 

The primary objective oftheVDC system to improve ride comfort while maintaining 
driving safety at an invariably high level. H igh levels of ride comfort are achieved when 
the vehicle body hardly moves along the vertical axis in spite of excitations of the vehicle 
induced by cornering or by the road surface itself (bumps, gaps). Forthis reason, the 
adjustable dampers are operated in line with a soft, comfortable damping characteristic 
curve in as many situations as possible. 

High levels of driving safety are achieved if the wheels never lose contact with the road 
surface and a high support force is available if required. A harder damping characteristic 
is therefore set if the driving situation or driver's intervention (e.g. steering, braking) 
demands it. 

As with EDC-K,the dampers have an infinite number of damping characteristic curves at 
their disposal; unlike EDC-K, however, the dampers are controlled not only axle by axle 
but also at each individual wheel.

In its regulation, the system uses the complete characteristic map of the rebound and 
compression stages between the comfort (1) and stability (2) threshold curves. 

In the event of a fault, the control range is minimized to safety characteristic curve (3). 

System Network 

The VDC system is a mechatronic system consisting of electronic, hydraulic and 
mechanical subsystems. These can be subdivided by function as follows: 

• Detection of input signals 

- Sensors for ride heights and rates of vertical acceleration to permit detection of 
the driving state and the prevailing road conditions 

- Control element to enable the driverto set the damping program (comfort, 
sport). This is located on, and electrically integrated in, the gear selector switch. 

- Steering angle (output by the SZL control unit via F-CAN) for preemptive 
detection of cornering 

- Lateral acceleration (out by the DSC sensorvia F-CAN) for detection of 
cornering 

- Vehicle speed orwheel speeds (output by the DSC control unit via F-CAN) 

• Processing unit 

- VDM control unit - This checks the plausibility of the incoming signals and uses 
control algorithms that deliver damping forces at individual wheels as a set point 
value 

- EDC satellite control units - These process the signals from the vertical 
acceleration sensors on the one hand and output the processed signal. On the 
other hand, they convert into a valve current the target force from the VDM 
control unit by means of a stored characteristic curve 

• Actuators 

The electrically controllable valve in the adjusting damper makes it possible to realize 
the different damping force characteristic curves 

• Communications media 

The VDM control unit is connected to the PT-CAN, F-CAN and FlexRay; the EDC 
satellite control units are only connected to the FlexRay

Electronic Height Control (EHC) 

Air Spring Functions 

The various control modes in the E70 are designed in a similar way to those in the E6x: 



Control Modes with Single-axle Air Suspension 

Ongoing control operations are not affected by transitions from one mode to another. 
Afterthe procedure of the follow-up time the EHC control unit sets the sleep mode. 

Any yet active control operations will be terminated. 

Sleep-mode 

The vehicle is in Sleep-mode at the latest when it has been parked forlongerthan 16 
minutes without a door or hood/trunk lid being operated orthe terminal status changing. 
This is the initial state of the control system. No control operation is performed in Sleep 
mode. The control system goes into Pre-mode when a wake-up signal is received by the 
EHC control unit. 


36 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 












Post-mode 

Post-mode is activated in orderto compensate for any inclination orto adjust the ride 
height after driving and between the Pre mode and Sleep mode. 

The Post-mode is limited in time to 1 minute. This mode is only executed if the engine 
has been running before the system switches into this mode. If the engine has not been 
running, Sleep mode is entered directly from Premode. 

The control operation is performed in a narrow tolerance band of-6 mm and is terminat¬ 
ed at-4 mm. The quick signal filter is used. In the event of an inclination (Kerb mode), 
the control operation takes place forthe nominal heights applicable in this situation. 

Pre-mode 

The activation of the Pre-mode with follow-up triggering afterwards takes place with flap 
change orchange ofterminal R from ON to OFF. The ride height ofthe vehicle is moni¬ 
tored and evaluated with a wide tolerance band. 

In Pre-mode, the vehicle is only controlled up to the nominal height if the level is signifi¬ 
cantly below the nominal height. The control tolerance band is -60 mm from the mean 
value. This control tolerance ensures that the vehicle is only controlled up in the case of 
large loads in orderto increase the ground clearance priorto departure. Small loads give 
rise to small compression travel and this is compensated only when the engine is started. 
This control setting helps to reduce the battery load. 

With single-axle air suspension, the vehicle is controlled down when the mean value of 
both ride height signals is > 0 mm and one side is in excess of +10 mm. 

In this mode, only the mean value ofthe two ride height signals (fast filter) is considered 
when deciding whetherthere is a need fora control operation.There is no inclination 
detection in Pre-mode. 

Normal mode 

Normal mode is the starting pointforthe vehicle's normal operating state. It is obtained 
by way ofthe "Engine running" signal. Ride level compensation and a change in the 
vehicle's ride height are possible. The compressor starts up as required. 

A narrower tolerance band than that in Pre mode can be used because the battery 
capacity does not have to be protected. The fast filter is used with a narrow tolerance 
band of ± 10 mm. In this way, ride level compensation takes place outside a narrow 
tolerance band of ±10 mm. The faster filter allows the system to respond immediately to 
changes in ride level. Evaluation and control are performed separately for each wheel. 

When a speed signal is detected, the EHC control unit switches into Drive mode. 

When the vehicle is stopped, the EHC control unit switches into Normal mode. 

The system switches back into Normal mode only when a doororthe trunk lid is also 
opened. If none ofthe doors orthe boot lid is opened, the vehicle logically cannot be 
loaded or unloaded. 


37 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 



This prevents a control operation happening when the vehicle is, for example, stopped at 
traffic lights and the ride height is above the mean value due to a possible pitching 
motion at the rear axle. 

TiltS witch 

The single-axle air suspension enters this mode if a signal is registered on the vehicle 
bus bytheTMPS. A flat tire can be relieved of load thanks to the "Inclination in run flat 
mode" function. When this message is received, the flat tire can be relieved of load by 
the venting of air on the defective side and an intake of air on the unaffected side of the 
vehicle. 

Drive Mode 

Drive mode forthe single-axle air suspension is activated when a speed of >1 km/h is 
detected. Low-pass filters are used. In this way, only changes in ride height over a 
prolonged period oftime (1000 seconds) are corrected. These are merely the changes 
in ride height, caused by vehicle compression and a reduction in vehicle mass due to fuel 
consumption. 

The high-pass filter (fast filter) is used during the control operation. The slow filters are 
re-initialized atthe end of the control operation. The markedly dynamic height signals 
caused by uneven road surfaces are filtered out. 

Kerb (Curb) 

The Kerb mode prevents the inclination caused by the vehicle mounting an obstacle with 
only one wheel from being compensated. Compensation would cause a renewed 
inclination ofthe vehicle and result in a renewed control operation afterthe wheel came 
off the obstacle. 

Kerb mode is activated if the difference in height between the left and right-hand side of 
the vehicle is >28 mm and this difference remains forlongerthan 0.9 s. No speed signal 
may be present for this mode to be set. The system switches from single-wheel control 
to axle control. 

Kerb mode is quit if the difference between the left and right-hand side ofthe vehicle is 
<24 mm and this difference remains forlongerthan 0.9 s or if the speed is > 1 km/h. 

If the system switches from Kerb mode to Sleep mode, this status is stored in the 
EEPROM. 

If the vehicle is being loaded or unloaded in Kerb mode, the EHC control unit calculates 
the mean value forthe axle from the changes in ride height determined from the spring 
travel on the right and left-hand side. 

A change in ride level is initiated if the mean value of compression or rebound atthe axle 
is outside the tolerance band of ± 10 mm. The left and right sides ofthe vehicle are 
raised or lowered in parallel. The height difference between the two sides is maintained. 


38 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 



Curve 

Since rolling motions have a direct impact on the measured ride levels, an unwanted 
control operation would be initiated during longer instances of cornering with an 
appropriate roll angle in spite of the slow filtering of the Drive mode. 

The control operations during cornering would cause displacement of the air volume from 
the outer side to the inner side of the curve. Once the curve is completed, this would 
produce an inclination which would result in a further control operation. Curve mode 
prevents this adjustment by stopping the slow filtering when cornering is detected and 
cancelling any adjustment that may have been started. 

Curve mode is activated above a lateral acceleration of >2 m/s 2 and deactivated at 
<1.5 m/s 2 . The lateral acceleration is recorded by the DSC sensor. 

Lift 

The Lift mode is used to prevent control operations when a wheel is changed or during 
work on the vehicle while it is on a lifting platform. 

This mode is detected when the permitted rebound travel at one or more wheels is 
exceeded >65 mm. A jacking situation is also detected and the ride height stored if the 
lowering speed drops below the value of 0,7 mm/s for 8 seconds. 

If the vehicle is raised only slightly and the permitted rebound travel has not yet been 
reached, the control operation attempts to readjust the ride height. If the vehicle is not 
lowered, a carjack situation is recognized after a specific period of time and this ride 
height is stored. A reset is performed if the vehicle is again 10 mm below this stored ride 
height. 

Special Modes (Belt) 

Belt mode is set during assembly in the works to prevent control operations. When Belt 
mode is activated, no message will be displayed in the instrument cluster. This is only 
recognizable by the non-deletable fault memory entry "energy-save mode active". 

Belt mode is cleared by means of diagnostics control only. The Belt mode can no longer 
set afterwards. 

New EHC control units (spare part) are supplied with Belt mode set. Control operations 
are not performed, the safety concept only operates with limited effect.

Functional Principle 


Initialization/reset Behavior: 

Different checks and initializations are carried out when the EHC control unit is powered 
up after a reset (triggered by an undervoltage). The system is only enabled after the tests 
have been successfully completed and starts to execute the control programs on a 
cyclical basis. Occurring faults are stored and displayed. 

Control Sequence 

In an ongoing control operation, the high-pass filter (fast filter) is always used to prevent 
the controlled height from overshooting the nominal value. If a low-pass filter (slow filter) 
were used to calculate the ride height, brief changes of ride height would be "absorbed". 

The low-pass filter is used when the vehicle is in motion (see Normal mode) to filter out 
vibrations induced by prevailing road conditions on this basis of this method offiltering. 

The high-pass filter is used to respond quickly to ride level deviations from set point. 
These take place while the vehicle is stationary in the event of large load changes (see 
Pre-mode). 

Both sides of the vehicle are controlled individually, i.e. even the set point/actual-value 
comparison for both sides is carried out individually. 

Exception: check for falling below the minimum height in Pre-mode and Kerb mode.The 
left/right mean values are taken into consideration here. 


40 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 
























The following stipulations are applicable here: 

• Raising before lowering 

• All valves controlled with control in the same direction 

• Individual wheel deactivation. 

To ensure reliable closing of the non-return valve in the air drier, the drain valve is 
controlled by the EHC control unit briefly for 200 ms afterthe control-up procedure has 
ended. 

The permissible ON period ofthe components is monitored while control up operations 
are executed. 

Safety Concept 

The safety concept is intended to inhibit any system malfunction, particularly unintention¬ 
al control operations, through the monitoring of signals and function-relevant parameters. 
If faults are detected, the system is switched over or shut down depending on the 
components concerned. The driver is informed of a malfunction by the display, and 
detected faults are stored for diagnostics purposes. 

In orderto ensure high system availability, existing faults, as far as possible, are cleared 
with terminal 15 ON. This is done by resetting the fault counterto zero. However, the 
fault memory content in the EEPROM is retained and can be read out for diagnostic 
purposes. 

The system is then operational again. The fast troubleshooting helps to detect existing 
faults before control operations can take place. 

Only lowering is permitted if: 

• The permissible supply voltage of 9 volts is undershot 

• The permissible compressor running time of 480 seconds is exceeded 

A reset takes place if the voltage is in the OK range of 9 to 16 volts or after the compres¬ 
sor pause time of 100 seconds has elapsed. 

Only raising is permitted if: 

• The permissible control down period of 40 seconds is exceeded 

• The reset takes place the next time the vehicle is driven or afterthe next control-up 
procedure. 

No control if: 

• The permissible supply voltage of 16 volts is exceeded 
The reset takes place as soon as the voltage is in the OK range.

System Components 


ARS Components 

ARS Control Unit 

The ARS control unit is located in the vehicle interior nearthe right-hand A-pillar. 



Index 

Explanation 

1 

ARS Control unit 


The ARS control unit is supplied with powervia terminal 30 and is protected by a 10 A 
fuse. 


The ARS control unit is activated exclusively by the Car Access System (CAS) on a CAN 
wake-up line after "ignition ON". 

A vehicle authentication process takes place when the system is started. This compares 
the vehicle identification numberfrom CAS with the vehicle identification number which 
is encoded in the ARS control unit. 

Then the ARS control unit's hardware and software are checked. 

All the outputs (valve magnets) are subjected to a complex check for short circuits and 
breaks. If there is a fault, the system switches the actuators into a safe driving condition. 

The ARS control unit switches off if there is undervoltage or overvoltage. 

The ARS control unit learns the offsetforthe steering angle and the lateral acceleration 
during start-up and during driving. 


42 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 











ARS Control Unit Inputs 

The ARS control unit uses the input signals to calculate control of the actuators. The 
input signals are also checked for plausibility and used for system monitoring. 

The ARS control unit receives the following input signals: 

• Lateral acceleration 

• PT-CAN 

• Front-axle circuit pressure 

• Rear-axle circuit pressure 

• Switch-position detection position 

• Fluid level sensor signal. 

The most important Dynamic Drive control signal is the measured lateral acceleration 
value. Additional information from the PT-CAN that describes lateral dynamics includes 
the road speed signal, steering wheel angle and the yaw velocity from the yaw rate 
sensor. 

From this information, the stabilization requirement is determined and the appropriate 
active moments are implemented. The road speed and steering angle signals also help 
to improve the response time of the system. 

ARS Control Unit Outputs 

All outputs are compatible with diagnostics and protected against short-circuit. 

The outputs include controls for: 

• Pressure regulating valves forfront and rear axle 

• Directional valve 

• Failsafe valve 

• 5 V powersupplyforthe sensors: 

- Lateral acceleration sensor 

- Pressure sensors at the front and rear axle 

- Switch-position recognition sensor (SSE). 

The valves are controlled by the supply of current regulated by pulse-width modulation 
(PWM). The current measurements of the individual coil currents are designed with 
redundancy. The valve currents are mutually checked for plausibility on a continuous 
basis. 

Thanks to the current measurement, the pressure can be set more precisely and the 
switch valves can be monitored electronically. 


43 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 




A telegram is sent to the DM E on the PT-CAN. The telegram contains information on 
how much powerthe tandem pump currently requires to supply the active anti-roll bars. 

In this way, output at the engine can be increased to satisfy the additional power 
requirement. 

A regular data signal (alive signal) is output and read by other ARS control units to identify 
whether the system is still active. 

All signal faults are detected and stored in the non-volatile memory. 

Fault symptoms of output signals are 

• Short circuit to terminal 30 and terminal 31 

• Open circuit and 

• Valve short circuits. 

Lateral Acceleration Sensor 

The lateral acceleration sensor supplies the main sensor signal. It measures the lateral 
acceleration of the vehicle during cornering up to a measurement range of 1.1 g. It is 
installed on the base plate underthe right front seat. The ARS control unit can learn an 
offset during start-up and when the vehicle is in motion.

Active anti-roll Bar 

The oscillating motor and the oscillating motor housing are joined by one half of the anti¬ 
roll bar. 

The active anti-roll bar consists of the oscillating motor and the anti-roll bar halves fitted 
to the oscillating motor, with press-fitted roller bearings fortheir connection to the axle 
carriers. The use of roller bearings ensures optimum comfort thanks to better response 
and reduced control forces.

Function of Pressure Relief Valves 

When the vehicle is driven on poor road surfaces, brief underpressures (cavitation) result 
from the movements of the anti-roll bar, which in turn could cause rattling noises. 

Pressure relief valves have been fitted on the front oscillating motor in orderto eliminate 
these noises. These pressure relief valves allow the filtered airto flow into the oscillating 
motor. This prevents cavitation. This small quantity of air is absorbed by the hydraulic 
fluid (Pentosin) to form an emulsion, which is discharged during subsequent activations 
of the oscillating motor. The surplus air is separated in the expansion tank. 

Since no noises can be heard at the rear axle, the pressure relief valves have been 
omitted from the rear oscillating motor. 


47 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 












Operating Principle of Oscillating Motors 

The oscillating motor has three functions to perform: 

• The oscillating motor transfers the torque into the anti-roll bars. 

• The oscillating motor de-couples the anti-roll bar halves. 

• In the event of system failure (failsafe mode), the front axle anti-roll bar creates 
sufficient damping via the oscillating motor hydraulic fluid (hydraulic locking). It now 
works like a conventional anti-roll bar. 

Exception: If the oscillating motor chambers no longer contain any fluid as a result of 
a leak, the front axle anti-roll bar can no longer create damping. 

The opposing chambers in the oscillating motor are connected to one another. 

The same pressure exists in both chambers. Two chambers are supplied with high 
pressure fluid using one connection. The two other chambers are connected to the tank 
via the return line. 

The forces FH (High) orFL (Low) are created as a result of the differences in pressure. 
Since FH is greaterthan FL, a torque MS is produced, which causes the shaft to turn in 
relation to the housing. 

Since one half of the stabilizer bar is connected to the shaft, and the other with the 
hous ing, the two halves turn in opposite directions. 

This torque MS generates the active moment M A around the vehicle longitudinal axis via 
the anti-roll bar connections which counteracts the rolling moment M during cornering. 
The shell is forced upwards on the outside of a curve, and dragged down on the inside of 
a curve. 



48 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 






The maximum body torque on the front and rear axle occurs when there is a high degree 
of lateral acceleration. The system pressure is then 160 bar at the front axle and also 160 
bar at the rear axle. At 160 bar, both oscillating motors generate a force of 850 Nm. 

If the oscillating motortwists as a consequence of external forces (road excitation, e.g. 
bumps or potholes), the oscillating motorthen acts as a torsional vibration damper. 

As a result of the twisting action, fluid is forced out of the two chambers. 

The fluid that is forced outflows through the lines and the hydraulic valve block, the 
hydraulic resistances in which produce a damping effect. 

In the event of failsafe locking (hydraulic locking), the oscillating motor can only twist with 
a very high damping effect as a consequence of the hydraulic jamming in the oscillating 
motor.

Pressure C ontrol Valves 

There is a pressure control valve on both the front and rear axles. They both adjust the 
actuation pressures for the front- and rear-axle anti-roll bars. 

During straight-ahead travel, the pressure regulating valves are in the precurrent-supply 
(0.35 A) stand-by position; the throttles are open. The fluid is able to flow freely into the 
tank. 

As the vehicle enters a bend, the valves are supplied with current. The pressure in the 
oscillating motors increases rapidly and is regulated to the set point value. Depending on 
the road speed and rate of lateral acceleration, pressures of up to 160 bar at the front and 
rear axle may be achieved. 

The pressure at the front-axle oscillating motor is equal to orgreaterthan the pressure at 
the rear-axle oscillating motor.

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 



















Directional Valve 

The directional valve is electrically actuated. It specifies the direction of the high-pressure 
fluid (active pressures) and the reservoir fluid for right-hand and left-hand bends. 

Failsafe Valve 

The failsafe valve (safety valve) is electrically actuated. The failsafe valve responds in the 
event of a failure in the power supply or if a fault is detected in the system. 

In the absence of current, the failsafe valve shuts down the front-axle oscillating motor. 
The rear-axle oscillating motor is short circuited and simultaneously connected to the 
tank line. The circulating position limits the system pressure and causes the flow to 
circulate. 

Switch-position Recognition Sensor 

The task of this sensor is to detect the specific position of the directional valve. 

2 positions can be detected: 

• Left-hand control 

• Right-hand control. 

Front-axle/Rear-axle Pressure Sensors 

The pressure sensors are responsible for detecting the front and rear axle anti-roll bar 
hydraulic pressures. The sensors are mounted on the hydraulic valve block. 

The pressure sensor offset values are learned by the ARS control unit once, during 
start-up.

Tandem Pump 

The hydraulic pumps fitted in the E70 were developed with a modular design. 

Depending on the engine and equipment specification, a suitably dimensioned hydraulic 
pump is flange-mounted to the engine in the same installation space. 

Decisive equipment attributes: 

• Basic steering 

• Active Steering AS (option 217) 

• C02 measure (option 1CB) 

• Adaptive Drive (option 2VA) 

• Adaptive Drive and Active Steering. 

The hydraulic pump driven by the engine's poly-V-belt is, on vehicles with Adaptive Drive, 
invariably a tandem pump, which consists of a radial piston part for ARS and a vane-cell 
partforthe power steering.

Radial Piston Pump (part of the tandem pump) 

This radial piston pump has 10 pistons set out in two rows and designed fora maximum 
pressure of 210 bar. 

When the engine is idling, the pump speed is approximately 750 rpm. Atthis idling 
speed, the radial piston part delivers a minimum fluid flow rate of approximately 6.75 
liters/minute at a pressure of approximately 5 bar. This means that sufficient system 
dynamics are also guaranteed when the engine is idling. 

At a pump speed of 1,450 rpm, the maximum fluid flow rate is limited to 13.3 rpm. 

Vane-cell Pump (part of the tandem pump) 

This part comprises 10 vane cells and designed for a maximum pressure of 135 bar. 

The vane-cell part has a characteristic map controlled fluid flow rate of 7-15 liters/minute. 

The decisive parameters forthe characteristic map are the vehicle's road speed and the 
steering angle speed. 

Adaptive Drive and the power steering share the same fluid reservoir and radiator. 


55 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 



Fluid Reservoir 

In the fluid reservoir is a fluid filter and fluid level sensor. The fluid filter cannot be 
replaced. The screw cap is fitted with a dipstick, which makes it possible to check the 
fluid level. A "MAX" mark indicates the maximum permissible fluid level, measured at 
room temperature (20°C). 

If a dipstick check at room temperature reveals the fluid reservoirto be dry, the reservoir 
must be topped up with the specified hydraulic fluid. If the lowest edge of the dipstick is 
still only just wet with hydraulic fluid (3), this is to be construed as the "MIN" mark.

Fluid Level Sensor 

The fluid level sensor detects the fluid level in the fluid reservoir. The fluid level sensor 
determines whether the fluid level has dropped below a critical minimum level and acti¬ 
vates a warning message. Normal movements of the fluid in the reservoir are not cause 
fora message. 

A mobile float contains a reed contact that converts float movements into an electric 
signal. 

The fluid level sensor is fitted to the fluid reservoir. Short/open circuits cannot be 
detected by the fluid level sensor. A line break is interpreted as a loss of fluid.

Hydraulic-fluid Cooler 

The hydraulic-fluid cooler serves to maintain a fluid temperature of <120°C in all 
hydro-mechanical components under all conditions, although temperatures of < 135°C 
are acceptable for brief periods.

Control Strategy 

The underlying control strategy is known as the "Skyhook regulator"; the name reflects 
the highest of control objectives: to keep the vehicle body at the same height irrespective 
of the driving situation (as if the vehicle were suspended from the sky). 

To achieve this highest of all comfort objectives, the movements of the entire body have 
to be evaluated. To this end, there is a comprehensive analysis of ride heights and 
accelerations along the z-axis within the frequency range of between approximately 1 and 
3 Hz. 


58 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 












The necessary (total) damping force forthis control component will turn out to be com¬ 
paratively low. To simultaneously ensure that the wheels do not lose contact with the 
road surface and that optimum contact force is transferred according to the situation, the 
movement of each individual wheel is evaluated and not just the movement of the entire 
body. The movements, or excitations, relevant here take place within a frequency range 
of between approximately 11 and 13 Hz and can therefore be distinguished from the 
movements of the body. This control component will therefore calculate high damping 
forces dependent on the vertical movement of the individual wheel. 

As a matter of principal, these forces may be different at each individual wheel and, for 
the first time with VDC, can be implemented as such. 

Furthermore, VDC regulation takes into consideration steering inputs (e.g. transition from 
straight-ahead travel to cornering) based on the steering angle curve. If VDC detects a 
rapid increase in the steering angle, the controller infers that the vehicle is entering a 
bend and can preventively adjust the dampers on the outside of the bend to a harder 
setting in advance. In this way, VDC is able to support ARS regulation and contributes to 
a reduction in vehicle rolling movements (of course, this applies also during steady-state 
circular driving). 

Moreover, VDC is able to detect the braking applications of the driver based on the brake 
pressure information supplied by DSC. A high brake pressure normally results in a 
pitching of the vehicle; VDC counteracts this by adjusting the front dampers to higher 
damping forces. 

This also results in an improvement in the front/rear brake force distribution, which in turn 
reduces the braking distance (by comparison with a vehicle without VDC). 

The VDC controller adjusts the basic damping force level in accordance with the damp¬ 
ing program selected by the driver (comfort/sport). Nevertheless, high damping forces 
are always applied at individual wheels in critical driving situations, e.g. despite the fact 
that the comfort program is selected. 

Once the individual control components have been prioritized, a target damping force is 
output on the FlexRay for each wheel or damper. In addition, the dampers are prescribed 
a current value forthe steady-state operating point. 

Display Control 

The VDM control unit is responsible for evaluating the button on the gear selector lever 
that the driver uses to select the damping program. Depending on the damping program 
selected, the VDM control unit issues a request on the PT-CAN to switch the LED in the 
button on or off (off = comfort, on = sport). 


59 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 



Degradation Behavior in the Event of a Fault 

Depending on the type of fault present, the VDM control unit decides which of three 
degradation levels must come into effect. 

• Level 1: Substitute values If, for example, the steering angle signal is unavailable, 
different variables will be used as a substitute value for cornering detection. 

The driver receives no failure message. No fault code memory entry is stored. 

• Level 2: Constant supply of current. 

The VDM control unit specifies a constant damping force, which is the same for all 
four wheels ("medium-hard damping"). This leads to a constant supply of current to 
the valve in the adjusting dampers. A triggering factorforthis degradation level may 
be a faulty ride-height sensor, for example. The driver receives a failure message. 

A fault code memory entry is stored. 

• Level 3: Zero supply of current. 

If a fault is present in the load circuit, e.g. in the control of a valve, the VDM control 
unit will select the third degradation level: it tells the dampers that the valve is no 
longer permitted to be supplied with current. The valve therefore moves into a 
position that corresponds to a rather hard suspension setting. The driver receives a 
failure message. A fault code memory entry is stored. 

From the damping force selected in the degradation levels, it can be seen that it is always 
the safe condition (hardertuning) that is adopted in the event of a fault (failsafe behavior). 

Diagnostic Functions 

The VDM control unit only stores its own faults in its fault memory. Faults with the EDC 
satellite control units are stored in their own fault memory. In the event of a VDC fault, 
therefore, it is necessary to check not only the fault memory of the VDM control unit, but 
of the satellites too. The VDM control unit also functions as a diagnostics gateway 
between the PT-CAN and VD-FlexRayso that the EDC satellite control units are accessi¬ 
ble to the tester). 

Note: The fault memories of the VDM control unit and the EDC satellite control 
units must be checked in the eventof a VDC system failure. Unlike the 
EDC-Kinthe E65, it is not necessary to perform straight-ahead calibra¬ 
tion of the VDC system following replacement of the steering angle sen- 
sor/SZL.

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 



EDC Satellite Control (with damper) 

This new generation EDC on the E70 is located externally, unlike the EDC system in the 
E65. The twin-tube gas-pressure damper, EDC satellite control unit and the EDC control 
valve with wiring as far as the first plug connection form one complete component and 
can only be replaced in this combination.

EDC Satellite Control Unit 

The following functions are implemented in the EDC satellite control unit: 

• Signal processing:The EDC satellite control units each have one single-axis acceler¬ 
ation sensor on the control unit board. It is a micro mechanical structural element, 
which converts accelerations into capacitance changes first and then into an analog 
voltage signal. 

This is processed accordingly by the EDC satellite control unit and made available to 
theVDM control unit via FlexRay. 

• Actuating functions: Each EDC satellite control unit has a damping characteristic 
map valid forthis type of damperthat is electronically stored in the form of support 
points. It is therefore possible to compensate for unavoidable tolerances (variations) 
arising from manufacture and achieve a higher degree of actuating precision (damp¬ 
ing force). 


61 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 















Note: TheEDC satellite control unit with twin tube gas-pressure damper 
and EDC control valve can only be replaced as one unit. The vehicle 
model and installation location (e.g. front left) must be stated when a 
replacement part is being ordered. 

• Diagnostic functions 

Each EDC satellite control unit is compatible with diagnostics and has its own fault 
memory. 

Note: The fault memories of the VDM control unit and the EDC satellite con¬ 
trol units must be checked in the event of a VDC system failure. If the 
E DC satellite control units do not respond to diagnostics, there may 
be a fault in the VDM control unit (diagnostic gateway) or FlexRay. A 
calibration of the ride-height sensors and acceleration sensors must 
be carried out in the VDM control unit following replacement of an 
EDC satellite control unit.

Ride-height Sensor 

The ride-height sensors are electrically connected directly to the VDM control unit. 

The mode of signal transfer is analog. Two way or one-way sensors may befitted to the 
rear axle, depending on the vehicle's equipment level. 

Two-way sensors deliverthe signal not only to the VDM control unit but also to the EHC 
control unit. 

Note: If a new ride- height sensor is being fitted, it must be ensured that only 
parts with matching part numbers are fitted. In particular, care must be 
taken not to confuse one-way and two-way sensors (one-way/two-way 
depends on the equipment level of the vehicle). Two-way sensors bear 
the marking "doppelt" on the housing.

• Load cutout signals 

• Terminal 15 ON/OFF 

• Vehicle speed 

• Lateral acceleration 

• "Engine running" signal 

• Hatch status. 

The EHC control unit decides on a case-by-case basis whether a control operation is 
required in orderto compensate for changes in load. It is thus possible to optimally adapt 
the frequency, specified heights, tolerance thresholds and battery load to the relevant sit¬ 
uation by means of the control operation. 

The EHC control unit is fully compatible with diagnostics.

Service Information 


If Dynamic Drive fails, DSC can no longer be deactivated or if it is already deactivated it 
does not switch back on automatically. The connections for all the hydraulic compo¬ 
nents are designed in different dimensions and lengths so that they cannot be trans¬ 
posed. 

A disturbing transmission of noise into the vehicle interior occurs due mainly to the 
assembly and line connections. The lines must not make contact; they must be routed 
correctly through the brackets without slack ortension. They are covered by the under¬ 
body paneling. 

Steering Angle Calibration 

After work on the front axle, it is necessary to carry out a steering angle calibration with 
the Dynamic Drive control unit. 

The Dynamic Drive system is dependent on the exact zero balance of the steering angle. 
The maximum deviation tolerance is 1. Precise chassis alignment is a prerequisite. 

The steering angle calibration must always be carried out on the measuring stand and in 
accordance with BMW axle alignment guidelines. 

The zero position is lost each time the Dynamic Drive control unit is flash programmed. 

A steering angle calibration is required wheneverthe control unit is flash programmed. 

ARS Initialization 

The initialization procedure must always be carried out once the system has been 
opened ora part has been replaced. This also applies afterthe lateral acceleration 
sensor has been replaced. 

The following conditions must be guaranteed for calibration of the offset values of the 
lateral acceleration sensor and the two pressure sensors: 

• The vehicle must be stand level on all four wheels 

• The vehicle must be unladen 

• The engine must be idling 

• Rest status (doors closed, persons are not allowed in the vehicle). 

No persons may remain within the vicinity of moving chassis parts during the initialization 
(both in the works and the workshop). In addition you must ensure that the basic 
commissioning conditions (temperature range, constant engine speed etc.) are 
maintained. The ground clearance must not be limited and the doors must not be 
closed. The arms of the hoist may no longer be situated beneath the car. 


71 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 




The commissioning procedure is split into five stages which follow on from each other 
automatically: 


1: direction valve test 

(from 3 to 3.4 s) 

Firstthe direction valve is tested by evaluating the signal ofthe SSE. 

II: low-pressure test 

(from 3.4 to 4.3 s) 

The failsafe and direction valves are without power during this stage. Then tests 
are carried out with pressure control valves with and without power on the front 
and rear axle.This causes the body to roll. The sides ofthe vehicle must be clear. 

III: high-pressure testfront 

axle 

(from 4.3 to 9.9 s) 

Pressure of 180 bar is applied to the front-axle oscillating motor. Air in the sys¬ 
tem, internal leaks and a blocked oscillating motor are detected. 

IV: high-pressure test rear axle 

(from 9.9 to 15 s) 

Pressure of 170 bar is applied to the rear-axle oscillating motor. Air in the system, 
internal leaks and a blocked oscillating motor are detected. 

V: pressure control valve test 

(from 15 to 25 s) 

The characteristic curves of the front and rear axle are checked (set point/actual- 
value comparison). Faulty pressure control valves are detected. 


ARS Bleeding Procedure 

A bleeding procedure must be carried out using the diagnostic tester if the ARS system 
was opened hydraulically. The bleeding procedure is performed exclusively by way of the 
initialization routine of the diagnostic tester and not at the pressure relief valves or at the 
screw plugs ofthe oscillating motors. 

If the test still detects air in the system, a short movement trip should be made if 
necessary. 

The initialization routine must then be repeated afterthe short trip. 

In the event of an extreme leak or suspected partial function ofthe pressure relief valves 
(noticeable by rattling noises in the front end), the pressure relief valves and the pneumat¬ 
ic lines must be replaced with new components.

Depending on the fault, the system displays one of the following responses. 

System Shutdown (failsafe status) 

The following faults result in system shutdown, i.e. all output stages are de-energized: 

• Fault in the front-axle anti-roll bar 

• Fault at the front-axle pressure sensor 

• Fault in the pressure build-up (pump, pressure-limiting valve on the front axle) 

• Fault in the control unit 

• VIN is not sent via the C AS / absent / incorrect 

• Direction valve position fault, faulty SSE 

• No PT-CAN signal 

The de-energized failsafe valve shuts off the chambers of the active anti-roll bar. Fluid equalization can only take 
place by means of internal leakage of the oscillating motor and valve block. The non-return valves in the valve 
block make it possible to siphon off the fluid to prevent cavitation in the front-axle oscillating motor. 

The chambers of the rear-axle oscillating motor must not be shutoff. 

The handling corresponds virtually to that of a conventional vehicle. The crossoverto the failsafe status can also 
be controlled in the event of extreme manoeuvring.

Restricted Control Comfort 

A lateral acceleration is calculated from the road speed and steering-wheel angle from the CAN signals. This signal 
is fasterthan the actual lateral acceleration and compensates the time delay of the hydro-mechanical system. In the 
event of a fault in these two signals, the system responds with a delayed roll compensation. This arises only in the 
case of extremely quick steering manoeuvres and is barely noticeable in normal cornering manoeuvres. 

In the event of a faulty lateral acceleration sensor, the lateral acceleration is calculated from the CAN signals only. No 
impairment of function can be detected by the customer. 

In the event of a fault in the rear-axle circuit, i.e. a stabilization at the front axle only, the customer notices that the 
vehicle is subject to larger rolling motions. Agility diminishes at road speeds < 120 km/h. 

The system also responds if the "failsafe valve jammed open fault" is detected in the Pre-drive check. 

An electrical fault in the rear-axle pressure sensor may result in minorfailures in roll-angle compensation. To be on 
the safe side, slightly more stabilizing torque is exerted on the front axle than in normal operation. This can be felt by 
the driver. 

Warning message Instruction 

Cornering stability slightly restricted Chassis stabilization slightly restricted around bends. 

Continued driving possible, contact BMW Service at next 
opportunity 


Restricted System Monitoring 

Dynamic Drive receives the following sensor signals from the DSC and SZL on the PT-CAN: 

• Lateral acceleration 

• Yaw velocity 

• Road speed 

• Steering-wheel angle 

These signals are used to check the lateral acceleration sensor. 

Drop-out of the engine-speed signal (DME) results in restricted control comfort. 

In the event of a fault in the lateral acceleration and yaw velocity CAN signals, the system is lacking two items of 
redundant information. Since this information is used exclusively for checking the other signals, the Dynamic Drive 
function is preserved with full control comfort. 

Although no restriction of the Dynamic Drive function exists, the message "Chassis and suspension-control system 
comfort restricted" is displayed for the driver who is requested to drive to the workshop at the next opportunity. 


Warning message Instruction 

Cornering stability slightly restricted Chassis stabilization slightly restricted around bends. Continued 

driving possible, contact BMW Service at next opportunity 


75 

E70 Vertical Dynamics Systems 










A "dynamic" driver will notice the absence of the steering angle signal. The warning 
messages must be acknowledged by the driver. Each warning message goes out only 
after it has been acknowledged. 

Once the cause of the fault has been rectified, the control unit can be returned to full 
function. 

There are two reset conditions depending on how fast a fault is to be detected: 

• All faults that are no longer present are reset with "ignition Off". Forthisto happen, it 
is necessary to wait until the vehicle has entered sleep mode before switching to 
"ignition On" again. 

• Sporadic faults which can mostly be traced back to communication faults in the CAN 
bus are then automatically reset while the vehicle is moving straight ahead or 
stationary provided they have only occurred briefly and rarely. In this case, the 
customer cannot detect the activation while the vehicle is moving or stationary. 

The associated faults with important additional information are stored in the fault 
memory. This additional information contains the kilometer reading/mileage at which 
the fault occurred, whether the fault is currently present and the frequency with 
which the fault in question has occurred. Thus, when the vehicle is brought into the 
garage/workshop, it is possible to carry out a specific analysis of the currently 
present fault and also an analysis of a sporadic fault.
