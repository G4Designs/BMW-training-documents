Introduction 


Displays, Indicators and Controls 

As in all other BMW models, the operating and control concept of the BMW X5 is based 
on clear and optimum structuring of the cockpit. Fewer switches simplify logical opera¬ 
tion. The display, indicator and control elements are organized and arranged depending 
on theirfunction. 

This product information is subdivided into the following sections: 

• Instrument cluster 

• Central information display (CID) 

• Connected service 

• Personal profile 

Note: The head-up display HUD is described in a separate Product 
Information.

Instrument C luster 

The instrument cluster in the BMWX5 is a further development of the instrument cluster 
fitted in the models ofthe BMW 5 Series and BMW 3 Series. 

The classic BMW two-eye design draws attention to the two circular instruments. The 
hanging arrangement ofthe needles in the analog instruments for the fuel level and econ¬ 
omy control is now standard in all BMW instrument clusters. 

The scales in the instrument cluster are specific to the country, vehicle and engine. 

The LC display is located in the center between the two large pointer instruments. 



Central Information Display (CID) 

The design ofthe central information display CID is identical to the CID fitted in the 
BMW 5 Series, and BMW 3 Series. 

The BMW X5 features the same software as used in the CID installed in the BMW 5 
Series and BMW 3 Series. 

As on the mid-range and luxury BMW models, the system is operated by means ofthe 
central control element, the controller. All functions are identical and are described in 
detail in the BMW X5 Owner's Handbook. 

This product information only outlines the changes compared to the BMW 3 Series and 
BMW 5 Series.

Connected Service 

Connected Service which consists of several modules opens up new options for the ever 
expanding communication between vehicle and service. 

Automatic, vehicle-specific acquisitions of serve requirements through to optimization of 
the reception procedure. Precisely planned schedules, early problem detection and flexi¬ 
ble service are only some of the service modules already implemented by BMW in the 
current model series and which are now also used in the new BMW X5. 

Personal Profile 

The "Personal profile" systems allows the driverto set several functions of the BMW X5 
to suit his/her personal requirements. 

Personal profile stores the data entered by the driver such as automatic setting of the 
outside mirrors or speed-dependent volume in the corresponding control units. 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked using the identification transmitter, the system recog¬ 
nizes the corresponding settings belonging to the identification transmitter. 

Up to three different basic settings can be adapted for three different persons. The pre¬ 
condition is that each of the three persons has his/her own identification transmitter. 

Note: Fordetailed information, please referto the complete documentation for 
the new BMW 3 Series and BMW 5 Series.

Functions 


Instrument C luster 


The instrument cluster receives information on the wiring harness in the form of analog 
and digital electrical signals.These signals are processed and displayed in the instru¬ 
ment cluster or passed on as information to other control units. 

The instrument cluster on the BMW X5 features several functions that have been 
changed compared to previous models. 


Gear and Program Display 
Gear Display 

The gear display is a coded function 
that is used for display and indication 
purposes in the instrument cluster dis¬ 
play on automatic transmission vehi¬ 
cles. 



■ Gear Position Display 

All gear positions are shown in a frame. 
This form of representation reduces 
the risk of misinterpreting the displayed 
information in the event of partial failure 
of the display. 



Fuel Gauge 


The fuel level is shown by an analog fuel gauge. 

Fuel reserve The reserve warning is no longer given by an 
indicator lamp but is now given by a check control mes¬ 
sage. A fuel pump symbol lights up for 23 seconds in the 
LC display as soon as the reserve level is reached. 

This display is permanently activated at a range of approxi¬ 
mately 50 km (31 miles).

E70 Displays, Indicators and Controls 




Display Areas Components 

The instrument cluster features display areas for: 

• Speedometer 

• Tachometer 

• Fuel consumption indicator 

• Fuel gauge 

• Outside temperature display 

• Indicator and warning lamps 

• LC display 

• Program and gear display 

Note: A shroud prevents reflections in the acutely angled windshield 



Speedometer 

The speedometer displays vehicle speed scale in both mph and kmh. 

Tachometer 

On the BMW 3 Series, engine speed is displayed using the following signal path: 

• The DM E control unit sends the engine speed on the PT-CAN and K-CAN. 

• Using a characteristic curve, step pulses for actuating the stepper motor are 
assigned to the effective engine speed. 

Note: The engine speed range is increased to 7500 rpm on vehicles 
equipped with 6- cylinderengines. 


16 

E70 Displays, Indicators and Controls 













Fuel Consumption Indicator 

The economy control is an analog indicator in the instrument cluster. 

Fuel Gauge 

The fuel level is indicated by a pointer instrument integrated in the speedometer on the 
left. A a fuel gauge icon lights up in the instrument cluster when the level drops below a 
factory-coded threshold (standard =2 gallons or 8 liters). 

A warning tone additionally sounds on reaching the reserve threshold. 

Outside Temperature Display 

A temperature sensor measures the outside temperature and displays it in the instrument 
cluster. 

In ignition key position 0, the instrument cluster applies terminal 30g current to the tem¬ 
perature sensor every 10 minutes. 

The instrument cluster makes available the current outside temperature in the form of a 
data telegram via the K-CAN. 

Indicatorand Warning Lamps 

The indicatorand warning lamps are activated 
by the processor in the instrument cluster. 

All important and legally stipulated indicatorand 
warning lamps are activated at terminal 15 ON 
during the pre-drive check. 

The indicatorand warning lamps can be illumi¬ 
nated in different colors or combinations. 

The significance of the indicatorand warning 
lamps as well as the color assignments are 
described in detail in the BMW X5 Owner's 
Handbook. 

LC Display 

The LC display is divided into two areas.The 
time and outside temperature are shown in the 
upper display along with the CC messages and 
CBS images. 

The on-board computerfunctions, CBS mes¬ 
sages, Trip odometer as well as the program 
display for automatic transmission are shown in 
the lower display.

Manipulation Dot 

Different data is stored in the instrument cluster and in the CAS 3 when a dot appears to 
the left of the trip odometer recorder. 

The manipulation dot is indicated when the comparison of the stored vehicle identifica¬ 
tion number does not agree. 

Different data may be caused, for example, byreplacing one of these two control units. 

Sound Generators 

Audible warnings are given in support of check control messages. The instrument cluster 
controls these warnings via the K-CAN.The warning signals are output by the 
CHAMP/CCC control unit depending on option. The footwell module is responsible for 
control of the direction indicatorfunction via the K-CAN. 

Note: US vehicles feature an ignition key warning and a seat belt warning. 

An uninterrupted warning tone sounds when the driver's door is opened with terminal 15 
OFF and the identification transmitter in place.The audible signal is switched off by 
removing the identification transmitter, closing the door or after 30 minutes.The seat belt 
warning is activated at terminal 15 ON if the seat belt contact is notclosed.The audible 
warning is intermittent and is no longer than 6 seconds. The indicator and warning lamp 
remains on. 

On-board Computer 

There are two versions of the computer available forthe BMW X5: 

• On-board computer- basic version 

• On-board computer- journey computer 

Which can be activated by encoding, depending on the vehicle equipment specification. 

A detailed description of the functions can be found in the product information on the 
BMW 3 Series and the Owner's Handbook forthe BMW X5.

Only the main test functions are listed in the following table. In addition to the majority of 
test functions there are further equivalent functions for which a similar display appears in 
the instrument cluster. 

C omponent Replacement and Trial Replacement 

There are three possible combinations for replacing the instrument clusters and car 
access system 3 CAS 3. 

• Instrument cluster defective, CAS 3 OK 

• CAS 3 defective, instrument cluster OK 

• CAS 3 and instrument cluster must be replaced. 

Simultaneous replacement of CAS 3 and the instrument cluster should be avoided. The 
odometer reading will be lost as a result. In principle, it is also possible to carry out a trial 
replacement of the instrument cluster and CAS 3.
