Lateral Dynamics 


Nowadays, dynamic driving systems are subdivided according to their mode of operation 
within the three axis co-ordinates and classified according to function. 

In the E70, there are two systems which count as lateral dynamics systems. Lateral 
dynamics systems (effective direction mainly along the y or lateral axis): 

• Servotronic - Speed-dependent hydraulic steering torque assistance 

• AS - Active Steering (previously AFS, Active Front Steering) 

The E70 is the first all-wheel-drive vehicle to be offered with Active Steering (AS) 
Servotronic is only offered in conjunction with the Active Steering. 

Active Steering (AS) 

Active Steering was initially offered in the E60 (5 Series). Since then, a large proportion 
of BM Ws in the 3 and 6 Series now have Active Steering. It is only the X models and 
other all-wheel-drive vehicles that have not yet been provided with this for reasons of 
space. 

This innovative steering system is now being offered in an all-wheel-drive vehicle forthe 
first time at BMW, namely in the E70.

Active Steering Features 

Previous Active Steering Systems at BMW 

The dynamic steering system known as Active Steering was used forthe first time in the 
world by BMW in the E60. The "variable steering-transmission ratio" is adjusted to the 
optimum ratio for all road speeds. During this process and depending on the road speed, 
an electric motor uses a worm drive to mesh with a special planetary gearbox with over¬ 
ride function and gear into the steering chain. 

This allows the steering system to generate a greater or reduced steering angle at the 
front wheels depending on the driving situation. Since it was implemented in the E90, 
Active Steering is also able to intervene in critical dynamic driving situations (braking with 
different friction coefficients on the left and right) by correcting the steering angle if the 
vehicle starts to become unstable using so-called yaw moment compensation. 

This stabilizes the vehicle more quickly than the driver could. Active Steering thus 
reduces intervention in the lower DSC control range and thereby provides optimum: 

• Agility 

• Comfort 

• Active safety 

Increased Agility 

Due to the direct transmission ratio, the vehicle is perceived as having a greater agility and 
handling performance up into the mid driving speed range (approximately 100 km/h). 

The driver also has far greater control when swerving, for example - this combined with 
considerably enhanced steering precision and reduced steering effort. Direct contact 
with the road via the steering wheel is maintained throughout. 

Increased Convenience 

Some previous steering systems have required more than 3 full steering-wheel turns to 
achieve a full wheel lock from the far left overto far right. Active Steering reduces this at 
low speeds to less than 2 steering-wheel turns from lock to lock. 

The benefit: less steering effort is required when turning in city traffic or maneuvering in 
narrow parking spaces. On twisting roads in mountainous regions, for example, the 
reduced steering wheel angle also ensures that hands always remain in the optimum 
position on the steering wheel, which means that crossing of hands, or even arms in 
some cases, is no longer necessary. The multifunction buttons on the steering wheel or 
the gearshift paddles forthe sequential manual transmission (SMG) therefore always 
remain conveniently within reach during every road situation. 


8 

E70 Lateral Dynamics Systems 



Increased Active Safety 

At higher speeds, the transmission ratio of the Active Steering is more indirect. This 
means that a rotational movement of the steering wheel generates a smaller steering 
angle than at lower speeds. 

This results in more comfortable directional stability. The effects of "snatching" the 
steering wheel, e.g. in a frightening situation, are considerably lessened by this. An assist¬ 
ing intervention by the Active Steering counteracts yawing forces and rotational move¬ 
ments of the vehicle around its vertical axis when they first occur by correcting the steer¬ 
ing angle of the wheel. Yawing forces (without active brake intervention) occur when the 
vehicle changes lane or swerves or when the load changes under cornering. 

Active Steering electronically controls the stabilization function at all speeds without the 
driver being aware of this. It also assists the driver by actively counter-steering when 
there are different friction coefficients under braking. 

Active Steering System Changes (as compared to E6X/E9X) 

Forthe first time, the customer can choose between standard power steering and the 
innovative Active Steering system in a BMW all-wheel-drive vehicle. 

Details in which the Active Steering in the E70 differs from those which are familiar in 
other series: 

• No physical cumulative steering-angle sensor 

• Virtual cumulative steering angle provides the same information as cumulative 
steering-angle sensor 

• Virtual cumulative steering angle describes the exact position of the rack and pinion 

• Virtual cumulative steering angle as reference for adjustment of track alignment (vir¬ 
tual steering angle "0" = rack and pinion exactly centered 

• Virtual cumulative steering angle is calculated from the driver steering angle and 
motor position angle 

• If the motor position angle is lost or discarded, the position of the rack and pinion is 
unknown and must be relearned, i.e. initialize the Active Steering. 

• Instead of yaw moment compensation, the E70 has yaw-rate control plus (GRR+) 

• Initialization has changed 

• There is no longer an ECO valve on the hydraulic pipe. It has been replaced by a 
new valve: Electronically Controlled Bypass Valve (EVV) 

• The wheel alignment check with KDS has a new feature that must be taken into 
consideration.

Special Functions 


Active Steering Transmission Ratio 

The Active Steering varies the steering-gearratio as a function of the road speed and the 
steering angle requested by the driver. The steering is designed to be indirect at high 
speeds. At lower speeds, the steering is more direct. 

The ease of handling the vehicle at low speeds or when parking is greatly increased by 
the Active Steering actuating unit. It is no longer necessary to grapple with the steering 
wheel. 

J usttwo turns of the steering wheel when the vehicle is stationary are enough to move 
the steering wheel from one lock to the other. At high road speeds (> 120 km/h), the 
Active Steering allows a more indirect transmission ratio than in conventional steering 
systems. The electric motor operates against the steering wheel angle at high speeds. 

Together with the elevated steering torque level (Servotronic), this has the effect of con¬ 
siderably improving the vehicle's directional stability.

Yaw Rate Control 

If the vehicle is threatening to oversteer, the Active Steering stabilizes the vehicle with a 
slight correction to the angle of attack of the front wheels. 

Example: The driver initiates a rapid lane change. This change in direction causes a 
certain tendency to oversteer in the vehicle. 

As the control thresholds fora DSC stabilization intervention are not yet reached in this 
case, the angle of attack of the wheels is slightly adjusted (maximum ±4°) by the Active 
Steering. The vehicle is stabilized by this active damping, but the driver does not feel it 
through the steering wheel. 

Yaw-rate Control Plus (GRR+) 

The "yaw-rate control plus" function assists the driver when he is braking on roads with 
varying friction coefficients, in a similar way to the yaw moment compensation. This func¬ 
tion represents a significant safety feature. 



In the case of braking on different surface friction coefficients (asphalt/ice or snow), a 
moment builds up about the z or vertical axis (yaw moment) rendering the vehicle unsta¬ 
ble. In this special case, the Active Steering control unit calculates the steering angle 
(maximum ±4°) required for the front wheels to keep the vehicle stable using the actual 
yaw rate and the longitudinal and lateral acceleration. 


11 

E70 Lateral Dynamics Systems 















This active counter-steering creates counter-torque about the z or vertical axis (red arrow) 
which compensates forthe earlier acting yawing force (yellow arrow). 

In this way, the vehicle is stabilized by clever interaction between the DSC braking and 
the AS function, resulting in a new safety aspect, unique in this class. 

Special Feature 

This function shortens the braking distance because the yaw-rate control plus allows 
higher braking pressure on the high friction coefficient side. 

Difference to Yaw Moment C ompensation: 

With yaw moment compensation, an important calculation principle for automatic early 
counter-steering was the difference between the front wheel braking pressures that were 
detected by the DSC and based on which the DSC calculated the angle for attack of the 
front wheels and transmitted to the AS control unit. 

This shared functionality of the DSC and AS control unit is now fully integrated into the 
AS control unit with yaw-rate control plus and, due to the high communication rate, 
precise interaction between the two units has now been achieved.

Power Steering Assistance 


Servotronic 

Power steering assistance is implemented by conventional hydraulic rack and pinion 
power steering. 

The magnitude and direction of the auxiliary hydraulic forces acting on the rack depend 
on the rotational angle of the torsion rod. The torsion rod is located between the steering 
shaft and pinion. 

Servotronic, the speed-dependent power steering assistance, is only available as an 
option with Active Steering. 

The output stage for Servotronic and its software are located within the AS control unit. 
The output stage for actuating the EVV is also within the Active Steering control unit. 

Tandem Pump 

The hydraulic pumps fitted in the E70 were developed according to a modular design 
principle. Depending on the engine and equipment specification, an appropriate hydraulic 
pump is located in the same installation space on the engine. 

If only the optional Active Steering is fitted, there is a mono-pump that consists only of a 
vane section.

System Safety 

Unintentional "self steering" by the system would be a safety critical feature of Active 
Steering and is prevented by the following measures: 

The safe system status (fail-safe) is when the actuator motor of the actuating unit is with¬ 
out power. Regardless of whether the system enters fail-safe mode as a result of a loss 
of power or an intentional system shutdown, it must be ensured that there is no possibili¬ 
ty of the actuating unit intervening in the steering. 

The actuating unit is arrested by a lock that engages in the worm gear of the actuating 
unit. The lock is pre-tensioned by a spring and held against this pretension by the power 
supply. The actuating unit is locked by an interruption in the power supply. 

The arrested superimposed gear unit ensures that it is still possible for steering wheel 
movements input by the driverto be transferred along the steering column. 

The steering then responds in the same way as conventional steering.The purely 
mechanical transmission between the steering wheel and the front wheels is retained. 

The electric motor of the Active Steering actuating unit is connected to 3 phases. A short 
circuit to earth will therefore prevent the electric motorfrom completing a full turn, the 
maximum possible being only 120° (360°: 3). 

The Servotronic valve switches under no electrical load to the fast driving characteristic 
curve. The power steering assistance is reduced accordingly. When the EVV is de-ener¬ 
gized, the volumetric flow is 7 l/min. 

Steerability is fully guaranteed in this situation. Fault statuses in the system are indicated 
to the driver via an indicator lamp system and Check Control messages in the instrument 
cluster. 

The Check Control message may read: 

"Active Steering failure! Steer with care." 

The following or similar message will appear 
in the Control Display: 

"Steering behavior altered! Possible to 
continue the journey. Steering wheel may be 
at an angle. Have the problem checked by the 
nearest BMW Service." 



14 

E70 Lateral Dynamics Systems 



Activation Conditions 

The activation conditions forthe Active Steering system are terminal 15 ON and a 
running engine. 

Afterthe engine is started, the system synchronizes the position of the steering wheel 
and the wheel lock. This ensures that steering wheel movements are detected when the 
system is deactivated (passive). 

The steering wheel position and the wheel lock always match. 

AS Control Unit 

The AS control unit (1) is located underthe wheel arch trim on the A-pillaratthe front left 
of the vehicle. 




The AS control unit is integrated into the vehicle electrical system by the PT-CAN and the 
F-CAN. The AS control unit calculates the control signals forthe AS actuating unit from 
various input signals. 

Every time the ignition is switched on, the system starts the pre-drive check. 

This includes initializing the AS control unit. The AS actuating unit is not activated during 
the initialization. The sensor signals are checked and, if necessary, calibrated. If errors are 
detected, eitherthe "Error" fault status is activated immediately or, if the "Fail" status is 
present, the yaw-rate control (GRR+) is deactivated, depending on the positioning. 

The actuating unit cannot be operated when the "Error" fault status is active. This is not 
the case if "Fail" is active. If initialization is successful, the "Drive" status is activated. 


15 

E70 Lateral Dynamics Systems 


The volumetric flow required forthe power steering assistance is calculated in the AS 
control unit from the following input variables: 

• Steering angle speed 

• Road speed 

• Calculated cumulative angle 

• Engine speed. 

The AS control unit is directly connected to the EVV in the hydraulic pump and adjusts 
the flow according to the required volumetric flow using a PWM signal. 

The AS control unit contains 2 processors that are asynchronously clocked and ensure a 
specific system reliability. It is connected to the AS actuating unit by conventional electri¬ 
cal lines. 

The function algorithms for calculating the target values for controlling the AS actuating 
unit are stored in the AS control unit. The electronics in the AS control unit supply current 
to the electric motor of the AS actuating unit via three alternating phases. 

The following function groups are available to the AS control unit: 

• Variable steering gearratio 

• Yaw-rate control (GRR+) 

• Servotronic 

• Electronically Controlled Bypass Valve (EVV) 

• Safety monitoring 

• Sensor plausibility monitoring 

• Actuator monitoring 

• Vehicle authentication 

• Pre-drive check 

• Commissioning 

• On board diagnostics 

• Fault code memory 

• Coding 

• Programming 

The AS control unit uses various input signals to calculate the signals for controlling the 
AS actuating unit.

Electric motor 


The AS actuating unit consists of a brushless synchronous DC electric motor and the 
planetary gearbox with override function (dual stage planetary gearbox). 

The core component of the AS actuating unit is a planetary gearbox with two input shafts 
and one output shaft. The input shaft is connected to the lower steering spindle as with 
standard Servotronic. The steering valve is located in between. The second input shaft 
is formed by the electric motor, which is driven by a self-regulating reduction worm drive. 

The self-regulating feature of the worm drive and the lock ensure that the worm is only 
turned by the electric motor. The worm drive drives a worm wheel that transfers the 
wheel steering angle input by the driver at the steering wheel. 

The brushless synchronous DC electric motor is permanently connected to the worm 
drive and engages with the worm wheel without any play. The direction of rotation, the 
speed and the duration of the electric motor movement are monitored by a motor-posi¬ 
tion sensor attached to the AS actuating unit in order to calculate the steering angle 
redundantly.

The overriding drive or planetary gear train basically consists of the following main 
components: a planet cage with worm wheel [4], the three planetary gear carrier shafts 
[7] with two planetary gear carriers [3, 6] on each, the sun gear input [2] and the sun gear 
output [11]. 

The planetary gear carriers form the mechanical connection between the sun gear input 
(input shaft I) and the sun gearoutput (output shaft). If the electric motorworm wheel [5] 
is stationary (input shaft II), the planet cage with worm wheel [4] (ring gear) is also fixed in 
position and the power is directed through the mechanical connection, both from the 
steering wheel to the rack and pinion and in the opposite direction. 

As the two planetary gears on a shaft are of different sizes, there is a gear ratio of 1:0.76 
from the steering wheel to the rack and pinion. As soon as the electric motorworm gear 
turns in one of the two directions, the planet cage and the planetary gears also turn. 

This means that, if the rotation is in one direction, there is positive overriding of input 
shafts I and II and, if rotation is in the other direction and the shafts are counterrotating, 
there is a negative overriding. 

The sum of the rotational movements between the steering wheel and the rack and 
pinion influences the angle of attack of the front wheels. In one case, the angle of attack 
is thus greater and, in the other case, it is smallerthan the angle input at the steering 
wheel.

Motor Position Sensor 

The motor position sensorforthe actuating unit is located at the rear of the AS actuating 
unit electric motor and consists of a sensor chip (magneto resistive element) and a 
magnet. 

The motor position sensor in the actuating unit detects the rotor position of the electric 
motor in accordance with the magneto resistive principle. 

The sensor chip receives signals along the vertical and horizontal from the measurement 
of the magnetic field direction. The sensor chip digitizes this angle information and 
transfers this square-wave signal through the two-wire connection to the AS control unit, 
on which the motor position sensor, in turn, receives its 7.5 V power supply. The motor 
position sensor in the actuating unit has a measuring range of 180°. 

The number of half turns is counted by the AS control unit and stored when the ignition 
is switched off. The information about the rotor position is sent by the AS control unit via 
a direct line as a pulse-width-modulated signal.

SZL Electronics 

The SZL electronics include a processor, a power supply and the following interfaces: 

• F-CAN 

• Optical switches 

• Electrical switches 

The optical sensorfor measuring the steering angle is integrated into the control unit 
circuit board. 

Steering Angle Sensor 

The steering angle sensor is designed as a contact-free, optical angle measurement 
system. The system consists of a code disc and an optical sensor. The code disc is 
directly connected to the steering wheel via a driver. If the steering wheel is moved, the 
code disc turns within the optical sensor. 



Code Disc 

The code disc is black and has a pattern of lines. This pattern consists of two continu¬ 
ous lines on the outside and inside of the code disc. 

Between the two continuous lines, there are discontinuous lines at certain distances from 
each other. These represent the digital range of the sensor. The digital code changes 
every 2°. 

The diagonal lines around the outside represent the analogue range of the sensor. 

These lines allow a more precise measurement (0.1°) of the steering angle.

Hydraulic Pump 


Electronically Controlled Bypass Valve (EVV) 

The EVV regulates the volumetric flow of hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic pump to ensure 
that only the volumetric flow currently required to provide power assistance is made 
available. 


Example: 

When the vehicle is being driven straight 
ahead without power assistance, the circula¬ 
tion pressure in the steering hydraulic circuit 
drops, thus reducing the circulation pressure 
and the power consumption. If a steering 
movement is required, the volumetric flow is 
immediately raised again and the usual steer¬ 
ing-angle speed is ensured. 

The EVV therefore controls the power 
consumption of the hydraulic pump, thus 
reducing the fuel consumption and the C02 
emissions ofthe combustion engine.
