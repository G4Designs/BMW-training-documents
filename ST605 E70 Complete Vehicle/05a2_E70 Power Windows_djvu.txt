The Car Access System 3 (11) issues the enable to actuate the powerwindow motors 
(1, 5, 8 and 13). 

If a powerwindow switch is then activated, the footwell module (3) (front powerwindow 
motor) orthe junction box control unit (10) (rear powerwindow motor) executes the 
desired request. 

Examples of the Window Switch Signal Path 

The following examples of a signal path show the path taken by the signal before the 
powerwindow motoropens orcloses the window. A requirement is that the Car Access 
System 3 has issued the enable for operation of the power windows. 

Driver's Door 

When the powerwindow switch forthe window in the driver's doororfront passenger's 
door is operated, the signal is routed via the LIN bus to the footwell module. The footwell 
module drives the corresponding powerwindow motor. 

The signal is routed from the driver's door switch cluster via the LIN bus to the footwell 
module when the powerwindow switches forthe windows in the rear doors are operated. 

The footwell module sends the signal via the K-CAN to the junction box control unit. The 
junction box receives the signal and activates the corresponding powerwindow motor. 

Front Passenger's Door 

The signal is routed to the junction box control unit when the powerwindow switch in the 
front passenger's door is operated. 

The junction box control unit sends the signal via the K-CAN to the footwell module. 

The footwell module controls the powerwindow motor. 

Rear Doors 

When the powerwindow switches in the rear doors are operated, the signal is routed to 
the junction box control unit. The junction box control unit drives the powerwindow 
motor.

Control Elements 


Driver's Door Switch Cluster 

The driver's door switch cluster is connected via the LIN 
bus to the footwell module. 

For opening or closing, the power window switch has two 
notch positions. The first notch position is used forthe 
manual powerwindow function.The second notch posi¬ 
tion (press) is used forthe toll function of the powerwin- 
dows. 

The powerwindow switches are resistance coded and 
switched to earth. The following graphic shows the princi¬ 
ple of a resistance coded switch. 

Window Switch Signal Evaluation 

The signals of the powerwindow switch in the driver's door switch console are 
evaluated directly by the driver's door switch cluster and transferred to the footwell 
module via the LIN bus. 

The signals from the powerwindow switches in the front passenger's door as well as the 
powerwindow switches of the both rear doors are evaluated by the junction box control 
unit.

Control Units 


Car Access System 3 

The Car Access System 3 is the central control unit for opening and closing the windows. 
Therefore, it issues the enable to operate the power windows During the engine start 
phase, it is not possible to move the power windows. This means more energy from the 
battery is available forthe starter during engine start-up. 

Footwell Module 

The relays forthe power window motors forthe front doors are installed in the footwell 
module. 

The footwell module provides information on the status of the door contacts and the dri¬ 
ver's door lock cylinder. 

The footwell module also provides the power window switch and the driver's door switch 
console with information on the "Terminal 58g ON" status. 

J unction Box Control Unit 

The relays forthe powerwindow motors forthe rear doors are installed in the junction box 
control unit. 

Remote Control 

The remote control can initiate the comfort opening/comfort closing procedure forthe 
power windows. 

Note: The ID transmitter can also perform the functions of the remote control. 
The comfort opening and closing function with the ID transmitter is 
therefore the same as with the remote control. 

PowerWindow Motors 

The powerwindow motors are equipped with Hall sensors that generate signals during 
motor operation. These signals serve the purpose of monitoring motor operation and are 
evaluated forthe anti-trap mechanism. 

The signals are evaluated in the footwell module and the junction box control unit.

Principles of Operation 


The functions of the powerwindows on the E70 are: 

• Opening and closing 

• Opening and closing with toll function 

• Comfort opening and closing 

• Indirect anti-trap mechanism 

• Panic mode 

• Load shut-down at terminal 50 

• Thermal protection of power window motors 
Opening and closing 

The Car Access System 3 has the central control function forelectric opening and 
closing ofthe powerwindows. 

This means that the Car Access System 3 issues the enable to open and close the 
powerwindows. The footwell module and the junction box control unit actuate the 
powerwindow motors and monitorthe motorspeed ofthe respective powerwindow 
motor. This means the footwell module orthe junction box control unit can respond to 
the following operating situations: 

• Trapping 

• Overheating ofthe powerwindow motor 

• Seizing of the power window motor. 

Opening and Closing 

The corresponding powerwindow motor is activated in OPEN or CLOSE direction by 
pressing or pulling the powerwindow switches to the first notch position.The power 
window motor remains active until the corresponding powerwindow switch is released. 

To ensure the powerwindow is closed securely, the powerwindow motor is briefly dri¬ 
ven to block status at the limit stop. 

Toll Function 

The toll function is implemented forall powerwindows.The corresponding powerwin¬ 
dow motor is driven in the OPEN orCLOSE direction by pressing or pulling a powerwin¬ 
dow switch beyond the limit stop. 

The powerwindow motor moves the window automatically until it is completely open or 
closed. Powerwindow operation is stopped when the powerwindow switch is pressed 
or pulled again.

Byway of example, the opening and closing procedure for one of the rear windows is 
illustrated bythe signal path in the following graphic.The opening orclosing function is 
initiated from the driver's door switch cluster.

Comfort Opening and Closing 

Comfort opening or closing can be performed with the remote control/ID transmitter via 
the door lock in the driver's doororthe outside driver's/passenger's doorhandle. 

Comfort opening with remote control The comfort opening function is initiated by unlock¬ 
ing the vehicle with the remote control and keeping the button pressed forlongerthan 5 
seconds. 

Initially, the front windows are opened, followed after a short time delay by the rear win¬ 
dows and the panorama glass roof. 

The signal from the remote control is picked up by the Car Access System 3 via the 
remote control receiver. 

The Car Access System 3 issues the enable to operate the powerwindows and initiates 
the comfort opening function. The footwell module and the junction box control unit cor¬ 
respondingly activate the powerwindow motors. 

With Remote Control 

The comfort closing function is initiated after locking the vehicle with the remote control 
and keeping the button pressed forlongerthan 5 seconds. Initially, the panorama glass 
roof is closed followed after a short time delay by the rear/front windows. 

If the folding exterior mirrors option is installed, the mirrors are folded in simultaneously as 
the rear windows are closed. 

Via the Driver's Door Lock Barrel 

There are two Hall sensors installed in the door lock forthe purpose of opening and clos¬ 
ing the vehicle. The Hall sensors enable the footwell module to detect the position of the 
mechanical key or of the spare key in the lock barrel. 

The key must be turned to the open or close position to initiate the comfort opening and 
closing function. The comfort opening or closing function is initiated when the key is held 
in this position. 

The footwell module sends the request via the K-CAN. On conclusion ofthe correspond¬ 
ing check, the Car Access System 3 initiates the comfort opening or closing procedure. 

With Comfort Ac cess 

In connection with Comfort Access, the comfort closing function is triggered via the dri¬ 
ver's/passenger's outside doorhandle. 

It is sufficient to touch the sensitive area ofthe outside door handle in orderto trigger the 
comfort closing function via the door handle. 

Comfort closing is triggered if the sensitive area is touched forlongerthan 5 seconds. 
The ID transmitter must be within an approximately 2 m radius ofthe vehicle.

Anti-Trap Mechanism 

Essentially, the indirect anti-trap mechanism does not prevent an object being trapped 
but rather it limits the trapping force to maximum 80 N.The power window motor is 
reversed on exceeding this trapping force. 

Thefootwell module and the junction box control unit monitor the activated power win¬ 
dow motors. The indirect anti-trap mechanism forthe front windows is activated by the 
footwell module.The indirect anti-trap mechanism forthe rear windows is activated by 
the junction box control unit. 

The indirect anti-trap mechanism in the E90 is based on the evaluation of the Hall pulses 
from the power window motors. The speed is derived from the Hall pulses of the power 
window motors. Speed fluctuations within certain ranges triggerthe indirect anti-trap 
mechanism so that the windows are opened. 

Operation of the power window switches is ineffective while the windows are in the 
process of opening. 

If no operable anti-trap mechanism is detected as the result of defective Hall sensors, the 
window can only be operated in jolts. The power window is in emergency mode and 
must be reinitialized. A Check Control message will be displayed. 

Panic Mode 

Panic mode is triggered by overpulling - releasing- overpulling (overpulling = pulling 
beyond limit stop) the power window switches. 

It is necessary to release and overpull the switch again as the anti-trap mechanism is still 
active the first time the switch is overpulled. 

Overpulling the power window switch the second time within 4 seconds closes the win¬ 
dow with maximum force. 

Note: The indirect anti-trap mechanism is no longer active in this case. The 
window closes at the maximum closing force and does not reverse.

E70 PowerWindows 



Load Shut-Down,Terminal 50 


To protect the battery, operation of the power windows is interrupted during the vehicle 
start procedure. 

The Car Access System 3 revokes the enable for power window operation in orderto 
interrupt current operation of the power windows. The signal is received by the footwell 
module and junction box control unit via the K-CAN. 

The power window switches must be pressed again following an interruption in opera¬ 
tion. The corresponding function is not executed if the power windows are operated dur¬ 
ing the start procedure. 

The enable for operation of the power windows is not issued until the start procedure has 
been completed. 

Thermal Protection 

The footwell module and the junction box control unit monitor the motor temperature. 

The motor temperature is determined based on the outside temperature, motor running 
time and the time the motor is stationary (not operative). 

Each motor can be switched off individually to prevent the power window motors over¬ 
heating during operation of the power windows). The motoris then deactivated fora 
defined period of time. The thermal protection facility does not prevent the windows 
being opened in the case of trapping. Once started, a powerwindow function is not inter¬ 
rupted by the thermal protection facility. 

In panic mode the window can still be closed even when the thermal protection function 
is active.
