E70 Interior Lighting 



Introduction 


The interior lighting in the E70 is based on the interior lighting system implemented in 
the E90.The interior lighting comprises the roof area, luggage compartment, footwell 
and inner door lighting. 

The lighting in outer area of the doors is provided by the courtesy lighting (outer door 
handles) and the exit lights. The interior lighting in the roof area on the rear driver and 
passenger sides consists of two separate lamps. A new feature is the split glove com¬ 
partment. 

The complete glove compartment lighting is powered and controlled by an electronic 
module in the unlocking/release drive unit. 

The following diagram shows where the control units responsible forthe interior lighting 
are located in the E70.

System Overview 


The input/output diagram comes immediately after the following description and shows 
a general overview of the input and output signals. 

The status of the door contact (Hall sensor) in the lock (3) changes, for example, when 
the door is opened with the vehicle unlocked. The footwell module (1) evaluates the sta¬ 
tus and sends the request to switch on the interior lighting. The roof functions center 
(10) switches on the interior lighting in the area of the roof. 

Parallel to this, the exit light (19) of the opened vehicle door as well as the footwell light¬ 
ing (18) are switched on. The status of the door contact changes again when the vehicle 
door is closed. The footwell module initiates the procedure to switch off the interior light¬ 
ing. 

The status of the rear hatch contact in the rear window central locking (13) changes 
when the rear hatch is opened. The lighting forthe luggage compartment (14) is con¬ 
nected to the power supply via terminal 30g so that the luggage compartment lights are 
switched on via the rear hatch contact.

System Components 


Interior Lighting, Front 

The components for the interior lighting in the front roof area are integrated in the roof 
functions center and in the sun visors. The footwell lighting is located on the underside 
of the dashboard. 


Roof Function C enter 

The interior light unit is integrated in the roof functions center. Therefore, a roof functions 
center is always installed in the E70. 

The vanity mirror lighting on the driver and passenger sides is powered bythe rooffunc- 
tions center. 

Various equipment options make it necessary to install additional components in the roof 
functions center. 

If a panoramic glass roof is installed, the roof functions center contains not only the but¬ 
ton forthe panoramic glass but also the necessary control and monitoring facilities. 

The ultrasonic interior movement detector is completely integrated in the roof function 
center on vehicles equipped with an anti-theft alarm system. 

The rood function center simply loops through the signals for all other components. This 
means the components are connected directly to their respective control units. 

These components are: 

• Emergency call button • Passenger airbag OFF lamp 

• M icrophone fortelephone • M icrophone forvoice input.

Control Units 


The "interior lighting" function is distributed over several control units that communicate 
with each other via the K-CAN.The individual control units are described in the following. 

Car Access System 3 

The car access system 3 sends the request to unlock/lock the central locking via the K- 
CAN. 

The signals are required to switch the interior lighting on and off. 

Footwell Module 

Based on the signals from the car access system 3, the footwell module recognizes the 
request to switch the interior lighting on/off. 

The following components are actuated directly by the footwell module: 

• Courtesy lighting 

• Exit lights 

• Handle-recess light 

• Storage space lighting 

• Footwell lighting 

The footwell module sends the roof function centerthe information to switch on the inte¬ 
rior lighting in the roof area. The individual lamps are activated by the roof functions cen¬ 
ter. 

The footwell module evaluates the status of the door contacts. The interior lighting is 
switched on when a door is opened. 

J unction Box Control Unit 

The junction box control unit is the interface to the luggage compartment and glove com¬ 
partment lighting. It supplies the power (terminal 30g) the lighting in the luggage com¬ 
partment. For lighting purposes, it reads the status of the button for unlocking and releas¬ 
ing the glove compartment. 

The junction box control unit is connected directly to the electronics of the unlock/release 
device on the left and right, which it uses to make available the start signal for unlocking 
the glove compartment. 

Roof Functions Center 

The roof functions center directly activates the front interior light unit and powers the rear 
interior light uniton the C-pillar. T he vanity mirrors are also powered by the roof function 
center. 


12 

E70 Interior Lighting 




Principles of Operation 


The interior lighting on the E70 is switched on and off by the footwell module FRM . 

The roof functions center FZD is responsible forthe interior lighting components in the 
roof area. 

The luggage compartment lighting is connected directly to terminal 30g.The following 
description outlines the interaction between the control units and functions in the interi¬ 
or lighting system. 

Footwell Module 

The footwell module is the central control unit forthe interior lighting system. All interior 
lighting outputs of the footwell module are pulse-modulated. This ensures the interior 
lighting functions at a constant brightness level in the event of voltage fluctuations. The 
pulse width modulation is additionally used forthe soft ON/soft OFF function. 

The footwell module features the following functions forthe interior lighting: 

• Switching the interior lighting on/off 

• Electric load shut-down after8 minutes 

• Lighting via terminal 58g. 

Switching On 

The footwell module receives numerous input signals that switch on the interior lighting. 
The input signals from the footwell module are read in directly or received via the K- 
CAN.The input signals forthe interior lighting are listed in the following.

Switching-on Conditions 

The interior lighting is switched on in response to one of the following conditions for 
switching on the interior lighting. The switch-on function is limited in terms of time. The 
electrical loads are: 

• Unlock via barrel lock in driver's door 

• Unlock via remote control/identification transmitter 

• Terminal R OFF when terminal 58g was ON max. 2 minutes ago 

• Lock button on remote control/identification transmitter pressed when the central 
locking has been in central arrest state for longer than 10 s 

The interior lighting remains permanently switched on in certain situations. These situa¬ 
tions are: 

• Receiving crash signal 

• Interior lighting button briefly pressed. 

Switching Off 

Thefootwell module receives numerous signals to switch off the interior lighting. The sig¬ 
nals are received via the K-CAN or are read in directly by the footwell module. 

Switch-off Conditions 

The interior lighting is switched off underthe following conditions: 

• Central locking in central arrest, all doors and the rear hatch are closed 

• Terminal R OFF after8 minutes (electric load shut-down) 

• Interior lighting button pressed forlongerthan 3 s 

• Terminal R ON with doors closed 

• Terminal 58g ON and terminal R OFF. The interior lighting is switched off if no door 
is opened within 20 s. 

• The interior lighting is switched off if the vehicle is unlocked via the remote 
control/identification transmitter and no door is opened after 20 s. 

• Terminal R OFF and a vehicle door is opened forlongerthan 1 minutes 

• "Powerdown" via diagnosis 


14 

E70 Interior Lighting 



Electric Load Shut-Down 

As from terminal R OFF, the interior lighting system is switched off by the footwell module 
after 8 minutes. Forthis purpose, the footwell module sends the electric load shut-down 
information via the K-C AN. 

The roof functions center FZD receives this information and switches off the interior light¬ 
ing in the roof area. 

The interior lights that are switched on directly by the footwell module are also switched 
off. 

Terminal 58g 

The footwell module makes available terminal 58g via the K-CAN or conventionally wired. 
Terminal 58g is pulse width-modulated and features the following two brightness levels: 

• The brightness level forthe locator lighting is individually adjustable using the thumb 
wheel on the lights operating unit. 

• The brightness level forthe function lighting is not dimmed and is switched on at full 
brightness. 

Hazard Warning Switch 

As soon as the hazard warning switch is pressed, the footwell module switches on the 
switch lighting at full brightness. 

Note: The hazard warning switch is not illuminated at full brightness level atter- 
minal 58g. The brightness depends on the setting of the locator lighting. 


15 

E70 Interior Lighting 



Roof Functions Center 

Forthe interior lighting system, the roof functions center represents the interface to the 
footwell module. Both control units are connected to the K-CAN to facilitate communica¬ 
tion between each other. For instance, the roof functions center receives the instruction 
to switch the interior lighting on or off via the K-CAN. 

The roof functions center is the link to the interior lights on the left and right in the rear 
area of the roof. 

Interior Lighting Functions 

The interior lighting functions in the roof functions center are: 

• Switching the interior lighting on/off on request from the footwell module 

• Reading the signals from the interior light buttons and transferring them to the 
footwell module 

• Reading the signals from the interior light buttons at the rear left and right and trans¬ 
ferring them to the footwell module. 

Terminal 58g 

The roof functions center receives the terminal 58g signal from the footwell module via 
the K-CAN and activates the lighting in the buttons. 

Luggage Compartment Lighting 

The junction box control unit provides the power supply (terminal 30g) forthe luggage 
compartment lighting. 

The status of the rear hatch contact changes when the rear hatch is opened manually or 
via the remote control/identification transmitter. This means the luggage compartment 
lights are connected to ground and therefore switched on. 

The status of the rear hatch contact changes when the rear hatch is closed again. The 
ground connection is interrupted and the luggage compartment lighting switched off. 


16 

E70 Interior Lighting 



Glove Compartment Lighting 

The electronics in the unlock/release devices of the glove compartment receive the 
request to open the glove compartment when the button to open the glove compartment 
is pressed. 

The junction box control unit reads in and makes available the signal from the button. The 
electronic module in the unlock/release device (on inside of vehicle) evaluates the signal 
and switches on the glove compartment lighting.T he lighting is switched on with the 
"S oft 0 N" function and off with the "S oft 0 F F" function. 

This function is derived from the interior lighting. 

The glove compartment lighting is switched off by closing the glove compartment. 

Note: The electronic module in the unlock/release device on the innerside of 
the vehicle is always responsible forthe glove compartment lighting. 

The glove compartment lighting is connected directly to terminal 30g. 

Car Access System 3 

The car access system 3 makes available the status of the central locking system via the 
K-CAN. In this way, the footwell module recognizes when the vehicle has been unlocked 
and consequently switches on the interior lighting.
