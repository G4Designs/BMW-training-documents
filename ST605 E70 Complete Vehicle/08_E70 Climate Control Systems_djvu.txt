E70 Climate Control Systems 


Introduction 


The heating/air-conditioning system ofthe E70 is designed as water temperature con¬ 
trolled system. 

The performance ofthe system has increased with regard to cooling power, heating 
power and comfort compared to the E53 system. Independently of othertechnology- 
related and market-specific configurations, three equipment variants ofthe heating/air¬ 
conditioning system are available in the E70: 

• IHKA, integrated automatic heating / air conditioning system (2-zone) 

• IHKA with FKA rear automatic air conditioning system (4-zone) 

• Optional 3rd row heating and ventilation system on the 5+2 seat package 

FKA is the rear automatic air conditioning system and has its own operating and control 
unitin the rear. This control unit is used to operate individual heating/air conditioning 
adjusting facilities forthe rear passengers. 

IHKA allows the temperature and the airflaps at the left and right sides ofthe vehicle to 
be controlled separately forthe driver and the front passenger. The vehicle interior is 
controlled in two zones (2-zone) in accordance with these individual settings. 

The optionally available FKA gives the rear passengers the opportunity to make separate 
temperature settings forthe left and right sides ofthe vehicle and control the blower in 
the rear. The vehicle interior is controlled in four zones (4- zone) in accordance with 
these four individual settings. 

Separate heating and ventilation forthe third row of seats is also optionally available for 
the optional 5+2 seat package. Heating is realize with the use of an electrical heater and 
ventilation through the use of a blowerfan located inside the 3rd row heating and ventila¬ 
tion unit. 


Note: E70 vehicles with the N52 engine are fitted with A/C compressors with 
a magnetic clutches. Vehicles with the N62 engine will initially be 
equipped with a clutchless A/C compressors.

E70 Climate Control Systems 




System Functions 


Depending on the equipment fitted, the E70 has up to six operating locations foradjust 
ing the different parameters (temperature, airflow, air distribution) for controlling the cli¬ 
mate of the vehicle interior. Depending on the equipment fitted, the operating locations 
are: 


• the IHKA control unit 

• the controller 

• the knurled adjusting wheels at the outlets 

• the stratification adjusters at the outlets 

• the FKA control unit 

• and the button with the knurled adjusting wheel 
for ventilation and heating forthe 3rd row of seats. 

With the FKA the facilities in the rear can also be operated using the controller 
and displayed in the relevant menu on the Central Information Display CID. 

Temperature Control 

The air-mass flow (fresh air or recirculated air) is first routed via the evaporator in the 
heating/air-conditioning housing, provided that the A/C compressor has been activated 
cooled and then heated to the required temperature via the heating system heat 
exchanger. 

When the air is cooled in the evaporator it is also dried at the same time. The conden¬ 
sate is led away via the condensation drains of the heater/air-conditioner. 

Fresh air or recirculated air can be routed directly to the air ducts via the evaporator and 
appropriate bypass, without being routed through the heating system heat exchanger. 

IHKA (2-zone) 

Due to its two-part heating system heat exchanger, the IHKA allows separate 2- zone 
right/left temperature control. The heating system heat exchanger has two temperature 
sensors. The temperature is controlled via two water valves (left/right). This variant has 
four additional actuator motors forairflap control and air distribution and therefore ten 
actuator motors in total.

IHKA with FKA Rear Automatic Air Conditioning System (4-zone) 

The 4-zone air conditioning system consists of the IHKA 2 zone plus: 

• Its own FKA control module 

• A separate rear blower 

• Four additional outlet temperature sensors 

• Air ducts in the B-pillars 

• To separate PTC heating elements in the rearfootwell air ducts 

• Three additional actuator motors for air flap control at the heater/air conditioner 
(IHKA with FKA, total of thirteen actuator motors) 

This system makes it possible to make separate left/right temperature settings for the first 
and second rows of seats, and also provides separate front/rear blower control. The rear 
blower enhances the airto flow to the rear center console and the B-pillar ventilation air 
outlets. The footwell ducts that deliver airto the second row of seat area can be switched 
off completely or provided with additional heating by energizing the PTC heating ele¬ 
ments. 

Adjustment and Operation of Rear Air-conditioning 

The Climate Control Menu allows us to activate orde-activate the FKA rear climate con¬ 
trol via the controller. A checked box next to "Rear Climate Control" function will show the 
system activated.The FKA control module settings can betaken overbyselecting the 
"Driver Settings" function and synchronized with the settings from the driver-side IHKA 
controls, but as soon as the FKA controls are operated by the rear occupants the rear 
controls become active once again.

Air Flow Control/Blower Speed Control 

Airflow control is dependent on the following settings and parameters. Blower control 
automatic mode If automatic mode has been activated in the IHKA control unit, the blow¬ 
er speed is controlled in accordance with a characteristic map depending on the required 
nominal temperature and the interior and ambient temperature. The relevant automatic 
blower control is switched off by operating one of the blower buttons of the IHKA. 

The Mode Switches to Manual 

With the FKA control unit the bloweroutput ofthe rear blower is switched to automatic 
using the AUTO button in the rotary actuator. If the blower buttons are pressed the FKA 
blower control switches to manual mode. 

Blower Control Manual Setting 

The blower control can be manually adjusted using a rocker button with the IHKA and 
FKA control units. 

Air Distribution/Air Flap Control 

Depending on the equipment specification (IHKA,IHKA with FKA) there are ten orthirteen 
air flap control actuator motors on the IHKA housing for controlling the air distribution in 
the vehicle. 

Airflap control takes place using the automatic programs in the IHKA and FKA for heat¬ 
ing/ cooling, depending on the request, depending on the required interior and ambient 
temperature. Air distribution/air flap control can also optionally (IHKA and above) take 
place depending on the amount of insolation, window fogging orthe quality ofthe fresh 
air. 

The airflow is distributed to the defrost, ventilation and footwell air outlets by the 
heater/air conditioner in accordance with the automatic program. 

Air Distribution/Air Flap Control/Automatic Mode 

Pressing the AUTO button on the control units causes the airflow control and the air dis¬ 
tribution to take place in accordance with the automatic control unit programs. 

Automatic mode is indicated by illumination ofthe yellow LED next to the AUTO button. 
Any intervention in automatic blower control or automatic air distribution causes the rele¬ 
vant part ofthe automatic control system to be switched off. 

If manual intervention only takes place in the blower control, the automatic air distribution/ 
airflap control remains active. 

If manual intervention only takes place in the air distribution/air flap control, the automatic 
blower control remains active. 

The LED next to the AUTO button goes off in both cases if manual intervention takes 
place. 


11 

E70 Climate Control Systems 



Manual Air Distribution/Air Flap Control Settings 

The air distribution in the vehicle can be manually adjusted via the controller and/or the 
rocker button of the IHKA control module. This kind of intervention in the automatic air 
distribution control causes air distribution automatic mode to be switched off. Manual 
adjustment of the front air distribution system is displayed in the relevant control menu in 
the CID. 

Operation and Adjustment/Air Distribution 

All control modules of the IHKA equipped E70 provide a facility for manually adjusting the 
air distribution using "rocker button air distribution" via the controller. 

The menu has four default settings and one individually configurable setting at the dri¬ 
ver's side, and three default settings and one individually configurable setting at the front 
passengerside. 

When the rocker button is operated, an "Air distribution" pop-up menu appears on the 
control display. 

The air stratification (ventilation temperature) can also be adjusted via the controller in this 
menu at the same time as the air distribution is being adjusted

E70 Climate Control Systems 



Air Stratification (Ventilation Temperature) 

Adjusting the air stratification via the air blending flap adjusts the proportion of cold and 
warm air at the ventilation vents. This setting adjusts the ventilation temperature. Only 
cold airorwarm airflows out of the ventilation vents at the maximum/minimum air blend¬ 
ing flap positions. 

The passenger can achieve individual cold/warm air distribution and stratification in the 
vehicle at a constant temperature setting using this stratification facility. 

The air stratification at the front of the vehicle can only be adjusted via the controller and 
is displayed in the CID control menu. 

The air stratification at the front can be adjusted separately for the left and right sides with 
the IHKA. 

The air stratification in the rear can be adjusted using a potentiometer in the rear ventila¬ 
tion outlet. 

The airblending flaps ofthe IHKA with FKA equipment variant can be controlled sepa¬ 
rately using two potentiometers, one in the left rear ventilation outlet, one in the right rear 
ventilation outlet. This means that the IHKA with FKA can provide individual 4- zone air 
stratification. 

Note: Attention must be paid to the air blending flap settings when 
troubleshooting a heating and cooling performance complaint. 

Automatic Programs (Gentle, Medium, Intensive) 

With the IHKA and IHKA with FKA equipment variants, two additional automatic pro¬ 
grams can be selected via the automatic programs selection menu in addition to the 
standard automatic programs. 

The IHKA control unit can be used to select and adjust the automatic program using the 
AUTO button as a rocker button or via the controller. 

The three different automatic programs 

• Gentle 

• Medium 

• Intensive 

Each have their own characteristic curves for blower control, air distribution and airflap 
control. 

The individual selecting facility within these three automatic programs allows more cus¬ 
tomers to satisfactorily operate the heating/air conditioning system in their vehicles in 
automatic mode without having to switch to manual mode.

E70 Climate Control Systems 



Operation and adjustment of the air conditioning system, automatic programs 

All control modules of the IHKA equipment variant have a facility for switching between 
the three gentle, medium and intensive automatic programs using the "AUTO Toggle 
button". 

The display is in the form of a pull-up menu in the CID when selecting and adjusting the 
automatic program using the AUTO button as a rocker button . However, the selection 
and the current setting also appear on the display of the IHKA control module. 

The automatic programs can also be selected and adjusted via the controller, with CID 
display. The air stratification adjusting facility appears in the air conditioning, automatic 
program selection menu first.

E70 Climate Control Systems 



Defrost Function 

The defrost function allows the control unit to be adjusted for defrost or de-misting the 
windshield at the push of a button. 

• The blower is set to the maximum setting. The front windshield fresh-airflap and 
ventilation vents are opened to the maximum. The ventilation and footwell vent flaps 
are closed. 

• A temperature cut-in takes place to control the interior temperature, depending on 
the ambient temperature. 

• The de-ice function also remains active if the blowerspeed is reduced by manual 
intervention. 

Note: In the version with FKA the rear blower speed is set to zero when the de¬ 
ice function is active. 

Cold Start Interlock 

The cold start interlock prevents the customerfrom being subjected to unpleasantly cold 
air when the engine starts and the engine temperature is cold. 

• The front ventilation and footwell flaps are closed. 

• The rearfootwell flaps and the rear air blending flaps are also closed. 

When the heating system heater core reaches the temperature level of the selected 
specified value, the airflap controllers are switched to automatic mode. 

Preventing Window Misting (Window Misting Sensor) 

In orderto counteract front windshield misting caused by high humidity, the interior 
humidity and the windshield temperature are measured by a mist sensor. 

If there is a risk of window misting, the following functions are activated depending on 
requirements: 

• Further opening of de-ice flaps, windshield air outlet. 

• Increase airflow volume via the blower. 

• Reduce airflow quantity to footwell. 

• Increase desired temperature value. 

• Switch from circulated air mode/automatic circulated air mode to partial 
fresh-air operation. 

• Switch from partial fresh-air operation with circulated air mode/automatic 
circulated air mode to fresh-air operation. 


15 

E70 Climate Control Systems 



The conditions forthese functions are: 

• Engine running 

• IHKA in automatic mode. 

The window misting sensor is available from the IHKA equipment variant and above. 

Heated RearWindow HHS 

The heated rearwindow is activated by pressing the HHS button.The LED lights up.The 
heated rear window is switched off by pressing the button again. After a programmed 
heating period (10 minutes or 17 minutes) the heated rearwindow automatically switch¬ 
es to cyclic operation. If the heated rearwindow is activated during cyclic operation, a 
second heating period of 5 minutes starts. 

Note: A prerequisite for heated rearwindow operation is KL15 and the "engine 
running" signal. 

Residual Heat Function 

The residual heat function uses the residual heat of an engine that has been turned off 
and is still warm to heat the vehicle interior. The functionality can only be activated within 
a run-on time of 15 minutes afterterminal 15 off. 

Fresh Air Circulation Mode/Automatic Air Recirculation ModeAUC 

The heating/air conditioning system draws in fresh airthrough the fresh-air outlet 
between the windshield cowl and the hood via the filter elements in the IH KA housing. In 
orderto prevent odors and emissions in the interior, the fresh air intake can be closed and 
the circulated air intake (air intake from vehicle interior) can be activated/opened. 

Circulated air mode can be adjusted directly by pushing a button or automatically via the 
recirculated air control system. The recirculated air control button must be activated by 
pushing a button to do this. The air quality is then monitored by the AUC sensor, and if 
the quality deteriorates when the vehicle is stationary at a traffic light or driving through a 
tunnel, for example, the system switches from fresh air mode to recirculated air mode. 


16 

E70 Climate Control Systems 



Function change: 

Fresh Air, Automatic Air Recirculation, Air Recirculation 

Both the IHKA control buttons and the M FL multi-function steering wheel can be used to 
select and adjust the fresh air, automatic air recirculation AUC and air recirculation func¬ 
tions. 

The functions are always run through in the same way when operation takes place via the 
IHKA controls. 

When the multi-function steering wheel is used, different functions are called up when 
the button is pressed depending on the initial setting. 


Rain/Driving Light Solar Sensor 

The rain/driving light solar sensor records the light intensity to which the vehicle interior is 
being subjected separately for the driver and passenger sides. 

The temperature rise due to heat from sun radiation in the vehicle interior is compensat¬ 
ed for in automatic mode by means of temperature specified value control intervention. 

C ompressor C ontrol/E vaporator C ontrol 

The cooling powerofthe system is determined by the potential evaporating capacity of 
the evaporator. The A/C compressor draws in the gaseous refrigerant from the evaporator, 
compresses it and sends the refrigerant to the condenser. The refrigerant, which liquifies 
in the condenser expands via the expansion valve at the evaporator. 

A/C compressors in the E70 with N52 are equipped with a magnetic clutch and an exter¬ 
nal control valve. 

N62 engines that were built between 12/06 and 10/07 are equipped with a clutchless 
compressor with an electronic control valve. As of 10/07 the N62 will also be equipped 
with an A/C compressor with magnetic clutch and a control valve. 

A/C MAX 

The fastest possible cooling of the vehicle interior is achieved by pressing a button. 
Activating the A/C MAX function activates the maximum cooling powerofthe air condi¬ 
tioning system (compressor and evaporator). Recirculating air mode is activated. The 
blower is switched to the maximum speed, the air stratification is set to cold and the ven¬ 
tilating flaps are opened to the maximum. 

A/C MAX mode is also retained if the blowerspeed is reduced. 


17 

E70 Climate Control Systems 



Parked Car Ventilation 


The Parked Car stationary ventilation can be activated directly via the controller under 
timer control or via a remote start. 

When operated via the controller, the setting is displayed in the relevant control menu. 

OFF Mode 

The IHKA and FKA control units can be switched off using the relevant buttons for 
adjusting the blower speed and set to Off mode. 

With the IHKA with FKA equipment variant, switching off the front IHKA automatically 
switches off the FKA as well. 

Seat Heating/Seat Ventilation 

Front SiH Seat Heating 

When the seat heating button is pressed, the IHKA transmits the status to the seat mod¬ 
ules orthe junction boxvia the K-CAN. depending on equipment. 

If the junction box is incorporated, the signals are relayed to the seat heating modules in 
the form ofPWM signals. 

The seat heating and the backrest heating are actuated by the relevant seat modules in 
accordance with the operating logic of the seat heating system. 

If the energy management system requests a power reduction, the heating power can be 
reduced or switched off in three stages: 

1. Heating power reduction from level three to level two. 

2. Heating power reduction to 50% of level two. 

3. Switch off seat heating.

E70 Climate Control Systems 



RearSiH Seat Heating without FKA 

If the SiH button is pressed on the rear center console seat heating operating unit, the 
seat heating and the backrest heating are directly actuated by the relevant modules in the 
control unit. 

If the energy management system requests a power reduction, the rear seat heating can 
be switched off via an overload-protection relay. 

RearSiH Seat Heating with FKA 

If the SiH button is pressed on the FKA control unit, the operating status is transmitted to 
the driver/front passenger modules via a PWM signal. These control the seat heating and 
the backrest heating. 

If the energy management system requests a power reduction, the heating power can be 
reduced in three stages: 

Pressing the buttons for >1.2 seconds switches the seat heating off, regardless of the 
level currently selected. 

SiL Seat Ventilation 

When the seat ventilation buttons are pressed the IHKA transmits the status to the seat 
modules via the K-CAN. The seat ventilation and the backrest ventilation are actuated by 
the relevant seat modules. 

If the energy management system requests a power reduction, the blower power can be 
reduced or switched off in three stages: 

1. Blower power reduction from level three to level two. 

2. Blower power reduction to 50% of level two. 

3. Switch off blower.

Heating and Ventilation of Third Row of Seats 
(Optional Seat Concept 5+2) 

An optional blower that can be activated using a button is installed for heating and venti¬ 
lating the third row of seats. T his blower draws in the air beneath the seats and blows it 
out between the seats in the 3rd row via the ventilation vent. 

The air distribution at the ventilation vents of the auxiliary unit can be moved up and down 
using a knurled wheel with control flap. A PTC heating element in the air duct is activated 
by a limit switch at the end stop of the air outlet knurled wheel. 

• The heated airflows into the footwell of the 3rd row of seats. 

• The heating function can only be activated with the blower switched on. 

• The airvolume cannot be controlled.

System Components 


Fresh Air/Recirculating Air Filter 

Fresh air is drawn in via two filter elements in the intake area in front of the bulkhead. 

The recirculated air is drawn in at the side by the blower via separate recirculating 
air filters. 

Fresh AirFiltering 

A particulate filter or a micro/activated charcoal "combination filter" is used forthe E70 
fresh air intake. The particulate filter (also referred to as a microfilter) removes dust, 
pollen, soot and otherdirtfrom the fresh airthat is needed to control the climate of the 
vehicle. The adsorption filter (activated charcoal filter) has the job of removing the pollu¬ 
tants (hydrocarbons, acidic gasses) that mainly occur in high concentrations under smog 
conditions from the fresh airthat is needed to control the climate in the vehicle.

Recirculated Air Filtering 

A new type of honeycomb filter is used in the recirculated air intake. The versions forfresh 
air particulate filters can also be used forfiltering recirculated air, but are used for cleaning 
the air in the passenger compartment. 

Filtertypes and equipment in the E70 All filters are electrostatically charged during manu¬ 
facture and have the characteristic of attracting particles and holding them in, therefore 
cleaning the air. 

The performance figures of an adsorption filter are initial pressure loss, particle separa¬ 
tion, dust storage capacity, gas adsorption (such as n-butanes, sulphur dioxide, toluene) 
and are independent of the filter surface and the air-mass flow. 

In orderto be able to cope with customer specific filter usage and associated change 
interval increases and reductions, the filter change intervals of the E70 have not been 
stored in the CBS (Condition Based Service) system. 

Note: The filter change intervals can be found in the relevant service literature. 

Evaporator 

The evaporator is a flat-tube evaporator with a chromium-free coating. This coating 
makes the surface smoother and more corrosion resistant that previous versions. 

A temperature sensor inserted at the side downstream of the evaporator records the 
evaporator temperature and reports it to the IHKA. 

In orderto prevent odors, BMW AG recommends two different ways of cleaning the evap¬ 
orator. See workshop system documentation for more information. 

Heater Core 

The heatercore of the IHKA has two inlet pipes, therefore providing right/left temperature 
separation and its maximum internal temperature is regulated to 96°C. This is achieved 
by closing the watervalves at 96°C.The control opens them again at 94°C. If the water 
valve is defective, the coolant temperature could exceed the permitted heatercore tem¬ 
perature. When the temperature exceeds 98°C, the map controlled thermostat is then 
regulated by the DME (ECM)to maintain the programmed temperature. 

Requestfor additional heating power 

Additional heating power can be requested by the heat managementfunction in the DME 
(ECM) via a special function control signal from the IHKA.This additional heating power is 
achieved by the DM E (ECM) by reducing the efficiency of the engine in orderto utilize 
more energy for heating.

Blower Unit 

The fresh air/recirculated air blower is flange mounted to the right side of the IHKA housing. 

The specified voltage forthe blower is provided by the IHKA (Master) as a defined control 
signal (PWM signal) via a single-wire interface of the blower output stage (Slave). 

The blower motor is actuated by the blower output stage depending on this variable con¬ 
trol signal. The line connections from the IHKA to the final stage are monitored by the 
IHKA. 

The blower and the output stage can be replaced separately. See appropriate 
workshop systems documentation. 

The motor voltage is limited to 12.5 V by the software. 

If an overload is detected at the output stage output or temperature protection 
is activated, the engine output is reduced.

Air Flap Control Actuator 

The IHKA actuator motors are all designed as identical components and are actuated by 
the IHKA via the LIN bus. When an actuator motor is being replaced it must be ensured 
that the correct plug is connected to the relevant motor from the wiring harness end. The 
plug order can be found in the wiring diagram. Then an addressing run must be started 
using the BMW diagnostics system. The IHKA detects the actuators that are connected 
in series and assigns an address to the new motor if necessary. 

The actuation of the addressing run is integrated in the diagnostics system in the service 
function (re-address body, heating/air conditioning functions, flap motors). A function test 
(reference run) is also integrated in the diagnostics system, with which the operational 
capability and the adjusting path of the motors can be tested.

IHKA Controls, Control Unit 

The number of E70 IHKA control and operating units is determined by the functional 
expansion from 2-zone to 4-zone air-conditioning, optional SiH heated seats, SiL seat 
ventilation and the optional version with and without electric steering column adjustment 
eLSV. 

The IHKA control units are incorporated in the car's electrical system via the K-CAN and 
the LIN bus using the following plug-in connections: 

• Main wiring harness 

• Air conditioning wiring harness 

• SZM 

• eLSV

Temperature, Air Flow and Air Distribution Control 

The IHKA is the masterfor controlling the temperature, the airflow and the air distribution 
in the vehicle interior. This is done by reading in the sensor values and converting them 
into actuator control commands in the automatic programs. 

The IHKA operating units (control units) have up to four different 5-volt voltage ranges: 

• Temperature sensors (heater core, evaporator, ventilation) 

• SZM logic supply 

• SZM function lighting and spotlight 

• eLSV (option) 

Two 12-voIt voltage supply ranges: 

• LIN 

• eLSV 

The signals that are evaluated in the junction box and the FZD roof function center are 
presented to the IHKA control unit via the CAN bus, where they must be read in and 
processed. 

IHKA Sensors 

NTC EvaporatorTemperature Sensor 

In orderto prevent the evaporator from icing up and implementing sliding evaporator con¬ 
trol, the evaporator temperature sensortransmits its signal to the IHKA. 

The sliding temperature control controls the evaporator temperature within a temperature 
range of 2°C to 8°C. 

The temperature sensor default value is -2°C. 

Heater Core Temperature Sensor(s) 

Depending on the equipment specification, one ortwo heater core temperature sensors 
are installed to record the air heating downstream of the heater core. 

With the IHKA, 2-zone and IHKA w/FKA, 4-zone, two sensors record the temperatures of 
the (separate for left/right) heat core sections. The temperature sensor default value is 
55°C. 

Front InteriorTemperature Sensor 

A ventilated temperature sensor is installed for recording the temperature in the vehicle 
interior. The default value is 20°C. 


34 

E70 Climate Control Systems 



Front C enter Ventilation Temperature Sensor(s) 

Depending on the equipment variant, the signal values from one ortwo sensors in the 
ventilation outlets are still used to control the temperature in the vehicle interior. 

The IHKA records the separately adjustable right/left temperatures with two sensors. 

The ventilation temperature sensor default value is 20°C.

Ambient and Engine Temperatures 

The ambient and engine temperature signal values are made available to the IHKA via the 
K-CAN. 

Rain/Driving LightSolarSensor 

Via roof function center FZD The new rain/driving light solar sensor RLSS of the E70 is 
clipped into a retaining ring beneath the windshield mirror base cover. The rain/driving 
light solar sensor separately records the insolation acting upon the vehicle occupants for 
the left and right halves of the vehicle. 

It generates two signals that are proportional to the insolation acting upon the vehicle 
occupants. The sensor signal is read in by the FZD via the LIN bus and relayed to the 
IHKA via the K-CAN. 

The signals are used by the IHKA to regulate the left and right airvolume and ventilation 
temperature.

MistSensorvia FZD 

The mist sensor BSS is directly clipped to a bracket on the rain/driving light solar sensor 
beneath the mirror base cover. 

The sensor provides early window mist detection, even before the driver can see any. 
Countermeasures are taken automatically at an early stage, without the need for driver 
intervention. Good ventilation is needed forthe sensorto operate efficiently. Suitable ven¬ 
tilation slots have therefore been provided in the mirror base cover that provide the sen¬ 
sor with an adequate amount of airflow.The sensor has to be within the range of the 
windshield wipers so that temperature changes caused by snow or ice on the other side 
of the windshield can be compensated for. The "glass conditions" that are present in the 
driver's field ofview must also exist at the sensor.This is the only wayforconclusions to 
be drawn about the window mist in the driver's field ofview from the mist at the sensor. 

A capacitive sensor element is used for early detection of possible dew formation on the 
windshield orfor removing mist that is present on the windshield. 

The sensoris supplied with 5V bythe FZD.There is a frequency signal at the sensorout- 
put. The signal, which is evaluated by a regulator, is read in bythe FZD and relayed to the 
IHKA via the K-CAN.

• Windshield

Pressure Sensor via J unction Box 

The refrigerant pressure input signal is a direct junction box input signal and is relayed to 
the IHKA via the K-CAN.The IHKA requests actuation of the auxiliary blower by the DM E 
(ECM) depending on the refrigerant pressure. 

The IHKA determines the relevant A/C compressor load torque on the basis of the input 
signals from the pressure sensorand the compressorspeed.The DM E (ECM) control 
units are notified of the load torques by the IHKA and used by the DM E (ECM) as input 
variables for actuating the electric fan.

38 

E70 Climate Control Systems 


AUC Sensor 

The AUC sensor is an air quality sensor and is used to control the ventilation in the vehi¬ 
cle interior (fresh air, recirculated air) in combination with the IHKA control unit, depending 
on how much traffic-specific pollutant the fresh air contains. This increases the well-being 
of the occupants and reduces the amount of pollutant to which the occupants are sub¬ 
jected. 

The AUC sensor is a fully integrated system consisting of the sensor element, the signal 
processing system and a digital interface. 

A metal oxide sensor is used, which is extremely sensitive to different odors and exhaust 
emissions that typically occur in traffic. 

The signal processing unit calculates the air quality level by continuously monitoring the 
quality of the fresh air. The IHKA control unit is notified of this via the junction box inter¬ 
face. Depending on other parameters (ambient temperature, humidity, road speed etc.), 
the IHKA control unit decides whetherto allow the recirculated air request from the AUC 
sensor (including determination of the duration thereof) or suppress it. 

The AUC sensor is installed at the airfilter housing in the E70. 

An important task that is performed by the electronics is accurate control of the sensor 
operating temperature. The sensor element needs an operating temperature of approxi¬ 
mately 300°C.The sensor detects gases that can be reduced and oxidized. The main 
ones are carbon monoxide CO (gasoline) and nitrous oxide NO as an indicator of soot 
particles from diesel vehicles.

A/C Compressor Control 

The IHKA is the masterfor controlling the A/C compressor. Pressing the AC button on 
the air conditioning system operating unit switches the air conditioning system to the 
ready state.The IHKA transmits a speed increase request to the DM E (ECM). 

Depending on the temperature and the nominal-value setting, the IH KA sends a cooling 
power request to the DM E (ECM) If the DM E (ECM) is ready and in a position to provide 
a torque of >20 Nm,the DME (ECM) issues a release for a load connection of up to 30 
Nm.This release is also monitored by the junction box. The IHKA issues a command to 
the junction boxto couple the connection. The junction box returns the coupling status to 
the DME (ECM) 

The compressor output is controlled by the IHKA control unit by means of an infinitely 
variable control valve. The IHKA control command is converted into infinitely variable pro¬ 
portional powering of the control valve in the junction box. 

The control is designed as "sliding evaporator control". 

The evaporator temperature is controlled to a value of between 2°C and 8°C depending 
on the cooling power request. The temperature sensor signal in the evaporator is used as 
a feedback signal to the IHKA control unit. The coolant request is limited by the potential 
evaporating power of the evaporator. 

The evaporator is prevented from icing up by controlling the compressor output (appro¬ 
priate reduction). 

In orderto reduce C0 2 emission, avoid unstable conditions when the engine is idling and 
forfull load acceleration the DM E can activate a compressor shut-off via the junction box. 
If appropriate parameters are present, the solenoid coupling of the compressor is opened.

Heater Water Valves 


The heater water valves are actuated by the junction box for controlling the temperature 
of the heat exchanger in accordance with the information from the IHKA.The "filling sta¬ 
tion effect" function is provided by the junction box. The watervalves are kept closed for 
three minutes afterterminal 15 has dropped to do this. 

Coolant Pump 

Depending on the engine variant, different types of coolant pump are used to circulate 
the coolant. In order to provide the coolant flow rate that is required at low engine speeds, 
an electric auxiliary water pump is installed (exception: the N52) 

N52B30-3.0i equipped vehicles will use an electric water pump with no need for an auxil¬ 
iary pump. 

N62B48-4.8i equipped vehicles will use a mechanical water pump with an auxiliary 
pump. 

The electric coolant pump of the N52 engine is actuated by IHKA request directly via the 
DME (ECM)through the K-CAN. 

The electric auxiliary water pump is actuated by IHKA request by the junction boxthrough 
the K-CAN. The auxiliary water pump is also needed forthe residual heat function. The 
residual heat function can also be achieved using the circulation pump if the vehicle is 
equipped with a circulation pump. 

Residual Heat Function 

The following on/off conditions must be taken into consideration when residual engine 
heat is being used to heat the interior with the engine switched off.

Heated RearWindow (HHA) 


The heated rearwindow is activated by pressing the HHS button on the IHKA operating 
unit.The signal is relayed to the junction box by the IHKA via the K-CAN.This switches a 
relay for powering the HHS. 

Activation is indicated by the function indicator lamp in the IHKA. Deactivation takes place 
afterthe first heating period has elapsed (10 minutes or 17 minutes) orthe button is 
pressed again. 

The "first heating period" is intended to allow the rear window to fully de-ice/demist. 

If the HHS button is pressed during the cyclic operation, the after heating phase starts 
(2nd heating period; 5 minutes). 

The "second heating period" is intended to give the rearwindow more time to de-ice/ 
demist if necessary. 

The cycling is intended to keep the rearwindow free of ice and moisture. 

The HHS is not operated continuously during the cycling phase, but in a rhythmic cycle. 
The active timer is stopped after "terminal 15 OFF". 

The status of the HHS is saved during the run-on time and restored with the relevant 
remaining timertime if "terminal 15 ON" occurs again within the run-on time. 

Aftera reset and "terminal 15 ON" aftera powerdown, the HHS is in deactivated mode. 

The HHS is switched off during "terminal 50 ON" in orderto protect the battery during 
the restart operation. 

HHS switch-on conditions 

• Terminal 15 ON 

• Activated operating condition 

• Engine running 

• No restart operation 

• No restriction caused by energy saving mode. 

Front Air Stratification 

The air blending flap can be adjusted via the controller for air stratification and ventilation 
tion temperature control. IHKA has a separate right/left air blending flap adjusting facility. 

Rear Air Stratification 

IHKA has a potentiometer in the ventilation outlets at the rear center console for adjusting 
the rear ventilation air stratification.

FKA Sensors 


RearlnteriorTemperature Sensor (FKA) 

Like the IHKA, the FKA control unit has an interior temperature sensorwith forced ventila¬ 
tion. 

RearC enter Ventilation Temperature Sensors (FKA) 

The delivery temperature in the FKA rear center ventilation is measured by two tempera¬ 
ture sensors in the ventilation outlet. 

Rear FootwellTemperature Sensors (FKA) 

The delivery temperature at the rearfootwell air ducts is measured by two temperature 
sensors in the footwell air ducts. The footwell temperature sensor default value is 55°C. 

RearlnteriorTemperature Control (FKA) 

The FKA reads the signals from the interior temperature, rearfootwell channel and rear 
ventilation temperature sensors in orderto control the temperature in the rear. The sensor 
signal values are transmitted to the IHKA by the FKA and centrally evaluated by a con¬ 
troller in the IHKA. 

The values of the calculated front and rear nominal temperatures are both used to calcu¬ 
late blower settings. 

The FKA receives input from the IHKA that is used for blower control and controlling the 
rearfootwell temperature. 

Note: If the actual rear temperature is greaterthan the specified reartempera- 
ture, the airflow from the footwell airoutlets is restricted. If the rear 
footwell temperatures are less than the specified values, the PTC 
heating element in the rearfootwell channels are activated by the FKA.

RearFootwell PTC Heating Elements Left/Right 

A PTC heating element is installed at the left and right in the rearfootwell air channels for 
the second row of seats. The heating elements act as auxiliary comfort heaters and pro¬ 
vide the occupants with a way of offsetting the rear temperature compared to the front, 
regardless of the heating situation in the front. 

The heating elements are operated by the FKA via a PWM signal depending on the rear 
footwell outlet temperature and any output capability limitations. 

The nominal rating of the PTC heating element is 300W with a voltage of 13V and air 
flow rate of 1 kg/m in. 

Heating/Ventilation forThird Row of Seats 

The 3rd row of seats has its own optional heating and ventilation system. The blower is 
switched on and off using the button nearthe center air outlet. The air distribution at the 
ventilation air vents in the third row of seats is controlled using a knurled adjusting wheel 
with control flap. A PTC heating element is activated via the limit position switch operated 
by the knurled adjusting wheel. 

The warm air is blown out via the lower ventilation air vents. 

The heating can only be activated if the blower is switched on. 

The control unit for heating and ventilating the 3rd row of seats is connected to the IHKA 
via the LIN bus and controls the heating element (output 300W) for heating the air in the 
footwell of the 3rd row of seats. 

The output of the heating element is controlled depending on the interior temperature in 
three stages from 0 - 100% (<20°C =100%, >20°C =50%, >30°C =0% PTC output). 

The DM E (ECM) (by means of a CAN signal to the IHKA and to the HB3SR control unit 
via the LIN bus) can reduce the power of the heating element (power reduction of 50% or 
cut off) within the scope of power management.

Bus Network Components 


Steering Wheel Heating 

The steering wheel heating is integrated in the steering column switching center SZL. 

In orderto operate the steering wheel heating the IHKA transmits the switching of termi¬ 
nal 15 and terminal 50, the power down signal and the consumer power control signal to 
the SZL by means of a P WM signal. 

Center Console Switch Cluster (SZM) 

The IHKA acts as the interface between the SZM and the K-CAN. 

The IHKA control units can read out the resistor coding of the SZM, determine which 
version of the SZM is installed and transferthese values via a diagnosis signal. 

The IHKA versions must be able to provide a maximum total current of 185 mA to sup¬ 
ply the SZM (search/function lighting and logic). 

Electric Steering Column Adjustment (eLSV) 

The steering column height and the distance between the steering wheel and the driver 
can be adjusted by actuating the eLSV in the IH KA and the drive block in the vicinity of 
the steering column in the E70. 

The drive block has an electromagnetic changeoverfor selecting the height and dis¬ 
tance adjustment coordinates. The steering column is adjusted by an electric motor. The 
steering wheel position and the permitted adjustment range are acquired using Hall sen¬ 
sors. 

The diagnostics forthe eLSV components are integrated in the IHKA control unit and 
must be selected via the IHKA control unit.
