E70 Adaptive Headlight System 



Introduction 


The adaptive headlights (AHL) is available as standard equipment.This system is 
installed only in connection with the bi-xenon headlight. 

T he adaptive headlight performs the exterior lighting functions. It also enables the 
bi-xenon low beam and high beam headlight to move within the driving range while 
cornering. 

The AHL feature requires the following: 

• Rain/driving light/solar sensor 

• Bi-xenon headlight 

The swivel range of the bi-xenon low beam 
and high beam headlight is continuously 
adapted while cornering. The illuminated 
area while cornering therefore improves the 
field of view for the driver. 

The adaptive illumination while cornering 
results in: 

• Safer cornering with faster recognition 
of obstacles 

• Improved perception of surroundings 

• Accident avoidance 

The electronic module of the adaptive headlight facilitates faster response to the current 
road situation. The system is controlled by the electronic module and is therefore less 
susceptible than a pure mechanical systems. 

In addition, an emergency program can be activated via the electronic module. 

Note: The adaptive headlight system is derived from the E90.Thefootwell 
module is therefore the central control unit for the adaptive headlight. 
The adaptive headlight has been adapted for use in the E70.

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 





Legal Requirement 

The swivel movement of the adaptive headlight is permitted within certain limits to pro¬ 
tect oncoming traffic, i.e. to ensure oncoming traffic is not dazzled by the headlights. 

The vehicle moves on a circular path when the driverturns the steering wheel. The circu¬ 
lar path is defined by the movement of the wheels and the angle position of the front 
wheels. 

In order not to dazzle the oncoming traffic, the salient point of the light/dark limit of the 
headlight must not be left of the circular path at a distance corresponding to 100 times 
the installation height of the headlight. 

This conclusion forthe light/dark limit refers to right-hand drive traffic. The conclusion 
relating to the light/dark limit applies symmetrically to left-hand drive traffic.

Footwell Module 

The control forthe adaptive headlight is located in the footwell module. 

The footwell module is connected to three bus systems, 

The bus systems are: 

• K-CAN 

• F-CAN, e.g. if vertical dynamics management is installed 

• LIN-bus 

Data from the vertical dynamics management system are received via the F-CAN. The 
footwell module receives and sends data via the K-CAN and LIN-bus. 

Note: The footwell module has no gateway forthe F-CAN, however, it does 
have the gateway between K-CAN and LIN-bus. 

Car Access System 3 

The Car Access System 3 sends the wake-up signal to the control unit in the vehicle. 
The steering column switch cluster is connected directly to the wake-up line. 

Dynamic Stability Control 

The dynamic stability control sends signals relating to the yaw rate and vehicle speed to 
the adaptive headlight. 

Rain/driving Lights/Solar Sensor 

The rain/driving lights/solar sensor sends the requestto switch on the low beam head¬ 
lights as soon as it detects low light levels (darkness). The light switch must be set to 
automatic high beam control forthis purpose. 

Roof Functions Center 

The roof functions center receives the signals from the rain/driving light/solar sensor. The 
roof functions center makes the signals available on the K-CAN. 

Vertical Dynamics Management 

Vertical dynamics management makes available the values for the dynamic headlight ver¬ 
tical aim control to the footwell module. 

The footwell module receives these values via the F-CAN. In this way the headlight range 
can be adapted to the different driving situations, e.g. laden/unladen. 


10 

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 



Bi-Xenon Headlight 

Each bi-xenon headlight contains following components: 

• Swivel module for bi-xenon headlight 

• Stepper motor controller 

• Stepper motorfor headlight vertical aim control 

• Side light corona/daytime driving light corona 

• Direction indicator 

• Bi-xenon control unit 

Rain/Driving Lights/Solar Sensor 

The rain/driving lights/solar sensor is fitted in the mirror base. The signals from the 
rain/driving lights/solar sensor are used to switch on the automatic driving lights. 

Roof Functions Center 

The rooffunctions centeris the gateway forthe rain/driving lights/solar sensor. It transfers 
the LIN-bus signal of the rain/driving lights/solar sensor to the K-CAN. 

Ultrasonic Passenger-Compartment Sensor 

The ultrasonic passenger compartment sensor signals the visual alarm of the anti-theft 
alarm system via the K-CAN.The visual alarm depends on the country-specific version. 

Note: The ultrasonic passenger compartment sensor is integrated in the roof 
functions center. 

Advanced Crash Safety Management(ACSM) 

The advanced crash safety management sends signals in the event of an accident. This 
allows the footwell module to triggerthe visual signalling (e.g. hazard warning lights ON). 

Swivel Module for Bi-Xenon Headlight 

Among otherthings, the swivel module contains following components: 

• Bi-xenon lamp 

• Hall sensorforzero position 

• Stepper motor 


11 

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 




The bi-xenon headlight control unit is mounted on the bi-xenon headlight. It supplies the 
power and ignition voltage for the bi-xenon light bulb. The bi-xenon light bulb is integrated 
in the swivel section of the adaptive headlight. 

The zero position Hall sensor registers the zero position of the swivel module. 

The stepper motor provides the swivel movement of the swivel module. A separate step¬ 
per motor is installed for the headlight vertical aim control. 

Stepper Motor Controller 

The stepper motor controller is mounted on the side of the bi-xenon headlight. 

The stepper motor controller controls and monitors the movement of the stepper motors 
for the adaptive headlight and the vertical aim control system. 

Side Light/Daytime Driving Light 

The side light/daytime driving light is designed as a fiber optics light guide ring. A 35 W 
bulb (H8) supplies the lightto the fiber optics ring from below. 

Lights Operating Unit 

The light switch must be set to automatic driving lights control in orderto switch on the 
adaptive headlight. The lights operating unit is connected to the footwell module. 

The light switch can be pressed in at a certain pressure in forward direction. This increas¬ 
es the impact surface area in the vicinity of the light switch in the event of an accident 
thus contributing to improved passenger protection. 

Direction Indicator/High Beam Switch 

The steering column switch cluster contains the direction indicator/high beam switch. 

The steering column switch cluster makes available the signal from the direction indica¬ 
tor/high beam switch hard-wired to the footwell module. A more detailed description of 
the steering column switch cluster can be found in the Product Information "Steering 
column switch cluster E70". 


12 

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 



Sensors 


Yaw Rate Sensor 

The yaw rate sensor makes available signals relating to the yaw of the vehicle about the 
vertical axis. 

The yaw rate sensor is installed on the driveshaft tunnel between the driver's and pas¬ 
senger's seat next to the advanced crash safety management ACS M. 

Rotation Rate Sensor 

The rotation rate sensors supply the signals forthe vehicle speed. The dynamic stability 
control evaluates the sensor of each wheel. 

Steering Angle Sensor 

The steering angle sensor is integrated in the steering column switch cluster. It is an opti¬ 
cal sensor and makes available data relating to the steering wheel lock angle. 

A more detailed description of the steering angle sensor can be found in the Product 
Information "Steering column switch clusterE70". 

Frontand RearRide-HeightSensors 

The signals of the ride-height sensors are used forthe headlight vertical aim control LWR. 
The ride-height sensors are connected directly to the footwell module. 

Note: If vertical dynamics management is installed, the information relating to 
the vehicle ride height is made available via the F-C AN. 

Brake Pedal Switch 

The signal of the brake pedal switch is used forthe headlight vertical aim control (LWR). 


13 

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 



Bus Systems 


The footwell module is connected to three bus systems, via which the adaptive headlight 
receives input signals. 

The bus systems are: 

• Chassis-CAN F-CAN 

• Body-CAN K-CAN 

• Local Interconnected Network Bus (LIN-Bus) 

Chassis CAN 

The F-CAN is connected to the footwell module forthe purpose of transferring data from 
the steering angle sensor. The signal path runs from the steering angle sensor in the 
steering column switch clustervia the F-CAN to the dynamic stability control, which in 
turn transfers the signal to the F-CAN. 

If vertical dynamics management is installed, the footwell module receives the data forthe 
dynamic headlight vertical aim control via the F-CAN. The data transferrate is 500 kBd. 

BodyCAN 

The footwell module receives information, e.g. 

"Terminal 15 ON", which is important for operation of the adaptive headlight, via the K- 
CAN. 

The K-CAN has a data transfer rate of 100 kBd. 

LIN-Bus 

The LIN-bus has a data transfer rate of 19.2 kBd. It connects the stepper motor con¬ 
trollers to the footwell module.

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 



Turn-Off Light 

The turn-off lightfunction is available only in connection 
with the option SA 524 Adaptive Headlight. In addition 
to the adaptive headlight, the turn-off light additionally 
illuminates the area in front of and beside the vehicle. 


The turn-off light makes it possible to recognize 
persons or traffic situations earlier in the turn-off area. 

Parameters such as the steering angle and vehicle 
speed are taken into accountforthe turn-off light func¬ 
tion. The turn-off light is integrated in the fog lights. 

This is due to the fact that the installation position of 
the headlights in the X5 is too high forthe turn-off light 
function and would not conform to legal requirements. 


The turn-off lightfunction is integrated 
in the fog light. This function is active 
only in position "A" of the light switch.

is that it is integrated in the fog light. The fog light with turn-off light 
function can be recognized from the outside by the fact that the 
reflector is completely chrome-plated.

Principles of Operation 

Headlight Swivel Movement 

Preconditions forthe adaptive headlight 

To ensure its operability, the adaptive headlight must be adapted to the vehicle specific 
data.The vehicle-specific data are located in the footwell module and in the stepper 
motor controllers. 

The footwell module contains the data: 

• Vehicle identification number 

• Vehicle type 

The stepper motor controller contains the data for: 

• Headlight and headlight swivel range 

• Permitted acceleration and deceleration ramps 

• Characteristic speed maps 

• Encoding 

• Vehicle identification number 

• Vehicle type 

Switch-On Conditions 

The adaptive headlight can be activated as from terminal status "terminal 15 ON". 

Initially, the footwell module switches on the stepper motor controllers. The adaptive 
headlight is ready for operation following a reference run of the bi-xenon headlights. 

Note: A reference run is performed during every new start. 

The conditions for switching on the adaptive headlight are: 

• "Terminal 15 ON" 

• Light switch in automatic driving light control position 

• Rain/driving lights/solar sensor detects darkness 

• Both bi-xenon headlights are intact 

Note: The footwell module detects a defective bi-xenon headlight by measur¬ 
ing the intake current of the respective bi-xenon headlight. 


20 

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 




Switching On Adaptive Headlight 

The adaptive headlight is switched on as soon as the rain/driving lights/solar sensor 
sends the switch-on signal forthe low beam headlight. 

Function Indicator 


Operation of the adaptive headlight is indicated by permanent activation of the LED for 
automatic driving light control. 

However, if the LED forthe automatic driving light control flashes while the adaptive 
headlight is active, this indicates that there is a fault in the adaptive headlight. 

The low beam headlight and the headlight vertical aim control remain active in the case 
of fault. The swivel function of the bi-xenon modules is deactivated. 

The light switch must be in the automatic driving lights control position. 


Reference Run 

In orderto determine the zero position, the adaptive headlight performs a reference run 
depending on the current position of the swivel module. 

To avoid a hysteresis during calibration, the swivel module always moves from the same 
side overthe zero position sensor. 


This is achieved in that the swivel module is always moved to the same side of the zero 
position sensor before switching off the adaptive 
headlight. 


Zero Position Sensor 

The zero position of the swivel module with respect 
to the zero position sensor is detected by a 1/0 
edge when swivelling from the direction of the off 
position in the direction of the optical axis. The 
swivel module is repeatedly calibrated during opera¬ 
tion based on this "soft" reference point.

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 























Mechanical Stop 

Items 1 and 7 representthe mechanical stops of the swivel module. The mechanical 
stops are defined by the design of the headlights. 

Differential Angle 

A differential angle is required when the position of the swivel module is not known. A 
reference run that extends to the mechanical stops must be performed forthis purpose. 

This is known as a "hard" reference run. 

Optical Axis 

The swivel position, in which the swivel module is in the straight-ahead direction of the 
vehicle is referred to as the optical axis. An angle of 0° is assigned to this position. 

The optical axis is defined exactly as an angle with respect to the zero position sensor 
and as an angle with respect to the mechanical stop. 

Consequently, the optical axis during swivel movement can be "normally" determined by 
way of the zero position sensor. 

The differential angle with respect to the mechanical reference point is used in the case 
of fault. 

Swivel Range 

Normally, the swivel module does not extend to the mechanical stop but ratherto the 
electric minimum and maximum stop. 

Adjustment of the swivel module to the electrical stops avoids the loss of pulses on 
reaching a mechanical stop. 

The minimum and maximum electrical stops are defined as angles with respect to the 
zero position. 

The movement range of the headlights is 8° with respect to the vehicle center and 15° to 
the outside.The swivel range is not restricted by mechanical tolerances. 

Swivel Direction 

Driving the stepper motor in positive direction of the swivel module corresponds to swivel 
movement to the right. 

Traverse Rate 

The traverse rate of the swivel modules is up to 30°/s. 


22 

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 



Swivelling 

The following signals are made available to the footwell module forthe purpose of moving 
the swivel module. 

• Steering angle 

• Road speed 

• Yaw rate 

Under normal driving conditions, the adaptive headlight is controlled by the data from the 
steering angle sensor up to a speed of approximately 40 km/h. 



The yaw rate sensor is included in the calculation:

• at speeds higherthan approximately. 40 km/h 

• in the event of vehicle oversteering or understeering 

• a vehicle tending to yaw 

The vehicle oversteering/understeering oryawing is detected by means of the steering 
angle sensor and the yaw rate sensor. 

The adaptive headlight is deactivated in the event of the vehicle oversteering/understeer¬ 
ing oryawing.The swivel module returns to its zero position. 


23 

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 







Stepper Motor Controller 

The stepper motor controller controls and monitors the stepper motors forthe adaptive 
headlight and the headlight vertical aim control of the respective bi-xenon headlight. 

The stepper motor controller performs following functions: 

• Receiving and evaluating the data sent from the footwell module via the LIN-bus: 

- Reference run 

- Target position commands 

- Diagnosis requests 

• Output control of the stepper motors 

• Zero position acquisition of swivel module 

• Reference run of swivel module 

• Position feedback of swivel module to footwell module 

• Diagnosis 

• Feedback of diagnosis data to the footwell module 

The footwell module in its function as the central control unit forthe adaptive headlight 
checks the status of the stepper motor controllers every 20 ms.

Zero Position of Swivel Module 

The zero position of the swivel module is determined by the zero position sensor. The 
zero position sensor is a Hall sensor. The falling edge of the Hall sensor is evaluated to 
determine the zero position.The zero position corresponds to exactly the position ofthe 
swivel module in the straight-ahead position ofthe vehicle. 

The stepper motor controller prepares the data for data transfer via the LIN-bus.The 
footwell module requests the data from the stepper motor controller. 

Note: The sensorsignal can be read outduring diagnosis.The sensoris defec¬ 
tive if no sensorsignal is applied. 

Switch-Off Conditions 

As from "terminal 15 OFF", the footwell module sends the request via the LIN bus to 
assume the rest position of both swivel modules to the stepper motor controllers. 

On reaching the rest position ofthe swivel modules, the stepper motor controllers send 
an acknowledgement to the footwell module. On receiving the acknowledgement, the 
footwell module switches off the stepper motor controllers. 

Afterunning Time 

The afterunning time is 2 s.

Service Information 


Replacing Components 

Various repairs may be necessary during the course of the vehicle's service life. As a 
consequence of repair work, it is possible that the system components forthe adaptive 
headlight are installed with different software and hardware versions. 

New and/or used parts are used together with the components already installed in the 
vehicle. 

In each case, the replaced components must be adapted to the specific requirements of 
the vehicle. 

The following components can be replaced as part of servicing: 

• Footwell module 

• Stepper motor controller 

• Bi-xenon headlight 

• Bi-xenon headlight retrofit 

Footwell Module 

After replacing an footwell module, it is necessary to enter the vehicle identification num¬ 
ber and to encode the control unit depending on specific vehicle data. 

The complete adaptive headlight function will not be operative if adaptation to the vehi¬ 
cle is not performed. 

Stepper Motor Controller 

After replacing the stepper motor controllers, it is necessary to store the vehicle identifi¬ 
cation number and enter headlight related coding in the stepper motor controllers. 

The complete adaptive headlight function will not be operative without this adaptation. 

Particular care must be taken when replacing the stepper motor controllers to ensure 
that the housing gasket of the stepper motor controller is fitted and seals correctly. 

Bi-Xenon Headlight 

After replacing the bi-xenon headlights, headlight-specific encoding is necessary for the 
respective stepper motor controller. 

If this adaptation is not performed, the function will appear to be operative but not cor¬ 
rect. 

The swivel range and zero point can vary from vehicle model to vehicle model and the 
bi-xenon headlight can have a different status! 

The headlights must be adjusted and checked.

Step error within the specified tolerance range 

Yes 

Self-adjustment every time a level change of the position sensor is detected. 

2 

Step error outside the specified tolerance range 

Yes 

Swivel range mechanically restricted, swivel module is moved to zero position, the swivel function is dis¬ 
abled, headlight vertical aim control remains active. 

3 

LIN-bus failure 

Yes 

Stepper motor controller: Emergency program. 

Footwell module: Error signal to indicator lamp, if possible move the stepper motor controller that is still 
operable in the optical axis position, headlight vertical aim control remains active. 

4 

UB- orGND and failure for stepper motor controller 

Yes 

Stepper motor controller: Operation not possible, system shuts down. 

There is no emergency power supply. 

FRM: Error signal to indicator lamp, nevertheless the stepper motor controller that is still operable is 
moved to the optical axis position and the swivel function is deactivated; headlight vertical aim control 
remains active. The corresponding headlight is deactivated as required. 

5 

Position sensor defective 

Swivel motor defective 

Turning mechanism defective 

It is not possible to distinguish between a position sensor defect and a mechanical swivel motor defect. 
Absence of level change of sensor signal within the specified tolerance range. 

Stepper motor controller: Emergency shut-down of swivel function. 

Low beam headlight disabled on affected side if there is a risk of dazzling. 

Fog lights switched on as substitute function 

Telegram to footwell module 

The dazzle effect may be avoided by lowering the headlight range using the vertical aim control. 

6 

Swivel motor electrically defective, short-circuit or break 

It is not possible to distinguish between the actual motorfailure and a defect in the supply line. 

Immediate shut-down of the swivel function. 

After evaluating the position sensor, in the event of possibly dazzling the oncoming traffic, the headlight 
range is reduced orthe headlight is switch off via the vertical aim control. 

7 

M otor for head light vertical aim control electrically defective, short-circuit or break 

Yes 

Immediate shut-down of the headlight vertical aim control function.

E70 Adaptive Headlight System 



















Diagnosis Mode 

The adaptive headlight must be set to diagnosis mode for following diagnosis tasks: 

• Read out of relevant bus signals with vehicle stationary 

- Road speed 

- Yaw rate 

- Steering angle 

• Checking signal plausibility 

• Checking that conditions for activation are fulfilled 

- Rain/driving lights/solar sensor status 

- Light switch status 

M issing or non-plausible BUS signals are stored in the form of fault codes in the footwell 
module. The fault types are stored in the stepper motor controller. 

The stepper motor controller is accessed via the footwell module.
