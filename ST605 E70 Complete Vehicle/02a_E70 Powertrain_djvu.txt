Transfer Case, Axles and Output Shafts 


In many aspects, the transfer box, axle drive units, propeller shafts and the output shafts 
in the E70 represent a further development of known components and technologies. 

One of the main objectives of this development was to increase efficiency in the drive 
train. 

Changes 

C hanges and modifications have been made to the known transfer box, axle drive and 
shaft systems in the E70: 

• Re-engineered transfer box 

• New front axle gearbox 

• Final drive unit with optimized friction loss 

• Propeller shaft fitted in a plug-on arrangement to the final drive unit 

• 0 utput shafts fitted in a plug-on arrangement to the final drive unit

T ransfer B ox ATC 700 


The transfer box ATC 700 is a further development of the ATC 500 that was fitted in the 
E53. The power is output via a chain to the propeller shaft to the front axle and appor¬ 
tioned by a multi-disc clutch. 

The torque transmission efficiency of the multi-disc package has remained the same 
compared to the ATC500. 

Only slight changes have been made compared to the ATC500. 

• Installation position of coding resistor 

• Optimized lifetime gear oil 

• New ventilation system 

• Transfer box control unit (VGSG).

Coding Resistor 

The locking power characteristic of the multi-disc clutch can vary slightly due to the 
mechanical tolerances in the production process. After measuring the actual locking 
power on the clutch test rig, a resistor is fitted to the actuator motor with its value repre¬ 
senting a reference regarding the progression of the locking power. 

Every time the engine is started, the transfer box control unit measures the resistance and 
correspondingly selects the optimum characteristic map for the installed transfer box. 

To facilitate accessibility, the coding resistor is no longerfitted on the casing of the worm 
drive but rather on the casing of the transfer box.

Transfer Box Control Unit 

The transfer box control unit is known from the E60 and E90 all-wheel drive models. 

It has a new housing that is not water-tight. It is arranged underthe luggage compart¬ 
ment floor on the left next to the battery.

Axle Drive 


Front Axle Gearbox VAG180A 

The front axle gearbox is a new design with an aluminum casing. As before, it is centered 
and mounted as part of the oil pan. In terms of function, the front axle gearbox remains 
the same as that in the E53 predecessor. 

Two different drive flange variants are used for 6-cylinder and 8-cylinder engines. 

• In connection with the N52B30O1 engine, the propeller shaft is connected by 
means of a flexible coupling to the front axle gearbox. 

• In connection with the N62B4801 engine, the propeller shaft is pivoted further 
downward due to the catalytic converters.

The front axle gearbox is adapted accordingly. Forthis reason, a universal joint is used as 
the drive flange in this case. The oil filler and drain plug is located in the same position as 
on the E53. The filler pipe is now equipped with a quick-release coupling. 

The E70 with the N52B30O1 engine is equipped with the familiarfinal drive unit 
HAG188K. The HAG188L is fitted on the E70 with N62B4801 engine. The use of 
angular contact ball bearings reduces friction loss and heat generation.

Final Drive Unit HAG 188K/188L 

The final drive unit (rear axle differential) HAG188K is already known from the previous 
model series. The HAG188L represents a further development that is fitted on the E70 
with N62B4801 engine. 

The output shafts are now also fitted in a plug-on arrangement to the final drive unit as 
known from the front axle gearbox of the E53. Since there is now no flange forthe output 
shafts, the final drive unit is supplied without an oil fill for replacement purposes. 

As on the front axle gearbox, a plastic ring protects the shaft seal while installing the 
output shaft. This ring must then be removed after installation. 

The propeller shaft is also fitted in a plug-on arrangement to the final drive unit and 
therefore also has no drive flange. Instead, the SAE gearing of the drive pinion extend 
out of the casing of the final drive unit. The propeller shaft is fitted onto the spline.

HAG188L 

Angular contact ball bearings are used in the HAG188L instead of the taper roller 
bearings in the HAG188K. The ball bearings greatly reduce friction losses. In addition to 
contributing to lowering fuel consumption, this measure also reduces power loss in the 
thermal balance of the axle drive. 

The HAG188L is 7.5 mm longerthan the HAG188K. In view of the heat generated as the 
result of the higher load, the HAG188L final drive unit is installed in connection with the 
N62B4801 engine.

Shafts 


Propeller Shafts 

A new connection arrangement of the rear propeller shaft to the final drive unit (rear axle 
differential) is used on the E70. The constant velocity joint of the propeller shaft is now 
bolted to the flange of the final drive unit but rather it is fitted onto the unit. 

This arrangement offers various advantages: 

• Reduced overall size 

• Improved balance characteristics 

• Shorter assembly time 

• Quieter running 

• Highertorsional rigidity

Casing of final drive unit 


The rear propeller shaft in the E70 is fitted onto the final drive unit. This arrangement 
provides many advantages regarding function and assembly. 

The output shafts are also fitted in a plug-on arrangement to the final drive unit as already 
known from the front axle gearbox.

Output Shafts 

The rear output shafts are now fitted in a plug-on arrangement to the final drive unit as 
already known from the front output shafts. The two gaiters on the constant velocity 
joints cannot be replaced. 

The housings of the constant velocity joints forthe front and rear output shafts are no 
longer powder-coated but now have a bright finish.
