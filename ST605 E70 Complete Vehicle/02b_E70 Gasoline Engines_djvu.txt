N52B30O1 Engine Features 

The N52B30O1 engine was introduced in the E92 in September 2006. The engine has 
been adapted for use in the E70. The changes and modifications to the N52K compared 
to the N52 and the components specific to the E70 are described in the following. 

Cylinder Head Cover 

The cylinder head cover on the N52K is made from plastic therefore steel bolts are used 
forthe threaded connections. The ground connection of the ignition coils is made by 
means of two stud bolts that are connected to the cylinder head. 

The crankcase ventilation is now integrated in the cylinder head cover together with the 
oil separator. 

Oil Pan 

The geometry of the cast aluminum oil pan has been correspondingly adapted to suit the 
space conditions in the E70. 

Crankshaft 

The crankshaft has a higher degree of balance (92 % instead of 83 %) in orderto reduce 
the load on the engine-gearbox system. 

Torsional Vibration Damper 

The design layout of the torsional vibration damper is adapted to the crankshaft. In view 
of the higher degree of crankshaft compensation, the first order vibrations are shifted into 
a higherfrequency range. The frequency range in which the torsional vibration damper is 
effective has been correspondingly adapted. 

The torsional vibration damper is designed as a composite damper. This means the 
rubber layerthat connects the masses is not vulcanized but rather takes the form of a 
rubber band. 

New bolts are used for mounting the torsional vibration damper. The tightening instruc¬ 
tions have been changed accordingly. M ixing up the bolts can result in damage to the 
belt drive. 

Belt Drive 

The basic belt drive has been adopted from the N52B30O1 engine in the E92. This belt 
drive is a single belt system and consists of a ribbed V-belt with sixV-ribs. Due to the 
higher load, the belt drive is designed as a double belt system if the E70 is equipped with 
at least one of the following options: 

• Active steering system 

• Adaptive drive 

• 220 A generator

ELAST drive belt for A/C compressor 


The main drive belt with seven V-ribs drives the power steering pump and generator. 

An ELAST drive belt with four V-ribs provides the secondary drive for the A/C compressor. 
In this case, the A/C compressor is correspondingly adapted to the modified belt drive. 

Only fit the ELAST drive beltforthe A/C compressor with the special tool specifically 
provided forthis purpose. Otherwise there is a risk of damage to the belt and the belt 
pulley. 

Camshafts 

In contrast to the N52, a lightweight construction intake camshaft produced in an internal 
high-pressure forming process is also fitted on the N52K.TO date, this type of camshaft 
was used on the N52 only forthe exhaust camshaft. 

For production reasons, cast camshafts can also be installed at the production plant. 
Forthis reason, the engine can befitted with any feasible combination of cast and 
lightweight construction camshafts. 

Valves 

The stem diameter of the exhaust valves has been increased from 5 mm to 6 mm.

Oil Supply 

Electronic oil level measurement An oil quality-level-temperature sensor (QLT) is used for 
the purpose of measuring the oil level in the N52B30O1 in the E70. 

Although the QLT is a new component, it has the same functions as the previous sensor. 
The QLT is longerto match the geometry of the oil pan in the E70. 

Intake Air Control 

Forthe firsttime at BMW, the intake airsilencer is a fixed part of the engine. The unfil¬ 
tered air duct is crash-optimized. An unfiltered air resonator and a double-chamber 
filtered air resonator are used forthe purpose of achieving the required sound quality.

Hot-film Air Mass Meter (HFM) 

A digital hot-film air mass meter (HFM) is used in connection with the N52B30O1 engine 
in the E 70. This HFM is accommodated in the cover of the intake silencer. 

Throttle Valve 

The N52K is equipped with a new throttle valve. The throttle valve setting is now 
measured in a contactless system by means of two redundant magnetoresistive sensors. 

These sensors exhibit an extremely high degree of measuring accuracy. The magnetore¬ 
sistive sensor is already known as the eccentric shaft sensor in the VALVETRONIC 
system. 

Compared to the potentiometers in the predecessor models, these sensors in the throttle 
valve permit 100 times the power level. This power ensures reliable signal transferto the 
DME. The sensors are also non-wearing. 

The signal is output in analog form by one sensor in the range from 0.3 to 4.6 V and 
inverted by the other sensorfrom 4.6 to 0.3 V. By forming the differential value, the DM E 
evaluates the plausibility of the signal. 

A new plug connector ensures the greatest possible contact quality. In this connector, the 
contactforce that acts on the pins is decoupled from the plug-in force. In this way, it has 
been possible to increase the contactforce by 10 times of that of a conventional plug 
connector. 

Note: The connectorforthe throttle valve can be plugged on twisted overthe 
firstfew millimeters. The connector may then be damaged if an attempt 
is made to plug it in with force. 

Engine Electronics (N52KP) 

Digital Motor Electronics 

The engine management M SV80 is used in connection with the N52K. This system is a 
further development of the MSV70 and several details have been adapted accordingly. 

The MSV80 now has a modified connection forthe digital HFM as it requires one less 
pin. The connection of the throttle valve sensors has a lower input resistance. 

This facilitates the higher current forthe magnetoresistive resistors. 

The relay forthe powersupply to the fuel injectors in no longer required on the 
N52B30O1 in the E70. The power is now supplied via terminal 87. 

Generator 

The basic generator for the M 52B30O1 engine is the Bosch M2.5 with a rating of 180 A. 
The Valeo TG23 at 220 A is used for equipment variants that have a higher power 
consumption.

N62B4801 Engine Features 


Oil Pan 

The geometry of the aluminum oil pan has been correspondingly adapted due to the 
position of the front axle gearbox. 

Belt Drive 

The belt drive of the N62B4801 engine has been modified for use on the E70. 

The generator and power steering pump has been repositioned for space reasons. 
The belt drive has been correspondingly adapted. 

The belt drive is a double system as standard. The main drive for the power steering 
pump, generator and coolant pump consists of a ribbed V-belt with seven grooves.

A/C compressor 


The A/C compressor is driven by an ELAST drive belt. A new feature of this system is 
that the ELAST drive belt is tensioned to the required value by a lineartensioner. 

This makes fitting of the ELAST-belt easier as no special tools are required fortightening. 


It is important that the procedure forfitting the ELAST drive beltforthe A/C compressor 
is followed precisely as described in the repair instructions otherwise the lineartensioner 
may be damaged. 


16 

E70 Gasoline Engines 


















The exact position of the generator and of the A/C compressor is ensured by a threaded 
insert. It is important to precisely follow the procedure described in the repair instructions 
when installing the generator orthe A/C compressor. Otherwise, the belt drive may 
squeak and result in damage to the ribbed V-belt. 

Electronic Oil Level Measurement 

The oil quality-level-temperature sensor (QLT) is also used on the N62B4801 engine for 
measuring the oil level in the E70. 


Intake Air Control 

Forthe firsttime at BMW, the air intake system is fixed to the engine in the E70. 

Flow conditions have been optimized forthe high airthroughput rates.The intake air 
control is designed as a dual-flow system in orderto minimize pressure losses on the 
intake side. 


Two unfiltered air resonators, one single chamberfiltered air resonator and one double 
chamberfiltered air resonator are used for achieving the required acoustic qualities.

Digital Motor Electronics 

The M E9.2.3 is a further development of the M E9.2.2. This system is equipped with a 
faster processor (66 MHz instead of 56 M Hz) in orderto cope with the increased scope 
of functions and diagnostic procedures such as OBD on CAN, wheel torque interface for 
xDrive. The ME9.2.3 also offers potential for the introduction offurtherfunctions in the 
future.

Exhaust System 

In line with the available engines on the E70, exhaust systems have been developed that 
comply with the more demanding requirements of this vehicle with regard to emissions, 
and acoustics etc. 

N52B3001 Engine 

EU4 and ULEV 2 are standard on the E70 with N52B30O1 engine. A catalytic converter 
with 900 cells is connected to each of the two 3-in-1 exhaust manifolds. The pipes of 
the dualflow exhaust system run adjacent to each other up to the intermediate silencer. 
The pipes have the same diameter of 55 mm. For ULEV 2, an underfloor catalytic 
converter is connected upstream of the intermediate silencer. The wrap-construction 
intermediate silencer has a volume of 5 liters. A front silencer is not fitted. The interme¬ 
diate silencer is followed by the crossover point designed as a pipe junction (1x75 mm). 
The transverse wrap-construction rear silencer has a volume of 30 liters. The right and 
left tail pipes pass through the bumper panel. 

N62B4801 Engine 

The E70 with the N62B4801 engine conforms to the ULEV 2 standard. The engine is 
fitted on both sides with a new air gap-insulated exhaust manifold with 4-into-l pipe 
arrangement, to which the close-coupled catalytic converters with 600 and 400 cells are 
connected. 

The dual-flow pipes of the exhaust system are separated on either side up to the 
intermediate silencer. The pipes are asymmetric with different length for sound 
engineering reasons. No front silencers are fitted. Each wrap-construction intermediate 
silencer has a volume of 4 liters. 

The transverse wrap-construction rear silencer has a volume of 36 liters. The left and 
right tail pipes pass through the bumper panel. Reliable compliance with the specified 
limit values is ensured by the engine application and the optimized monolith load which 
also render a secondary air system unnecessary. 


20 

E70 Gasoline Engines 



Cooling System 

The cooling system of the E70 is based on a modular design. The following illustration 
shows the components of the cooling module. The components that make up the 
cooling module are dependent on the installed engine and the equipment configuration. 

The following components in the cooling module may differ: 

• Electric fan (400 W/600 W) 

• Radiator 

• Engine oil cooler in side panel module (eitherfitted or not)

This means there are four different variants of the cooling module available forthe E70 
with gasoline engines. The all-aluminum radiator operates in accordance with the 
familiar cross-flow principle. 

The engine oil cooler is mounted separate and is located in the side panel module on the 
left. The oil lines have a separating point with quick-release couplings to the side panel 
module. 

The gearbox oil-to-coolant heat exchanger is based on a new design with improved 
efficiency. 

Do not grasp into the fan ring when carrying the electric fan as it is easily breakable.

Electric Coolant Pump 

The electric coolant pump forthe N52B30O1 engine in the E70 is a version of the 
Siemens coolant pump modified to 200 W and as known from the N54 engine. 

The reason forthe modification is notthe required cooling capacity but ratherthe restrict¬ 
ed space conditions. Forthis reason, the 200 W Pierburg pump is not used as is stan¬ 
dard on the N52K engine.

E70 Gasoline Engines 





























































Fuel Supply System 

FuelTank Volume 

The E70 is equipped with a plastic fuel tank with two chambers providing a tank volume 
of 85 liters. 

Fuel Tank Ventilation 

The carbon canister is larger on US models as the vapors that occur while refuelling the 
tank are not extracted by the fuel-pump nozzle. 

The vapors are cleaned by the carbon canister and given off via a dust filter into the 
atmosphere. There is also a diagnostic module (DMTL). 

Design 

The fuel supply system has two delivery units that are accommodated in the right and left 
fuel tank halves. 

The fuel pump (13) with prefilter (10) and fuel filter (7) are part of the right-hand delivery 
unit. The swirl pot including a suction jet pump (9) with non-return valve (12) and initial 
filling valve (11) as well as a fuel level sensor (8) complete this delivery unit. The fuel 
pump and filter can only be replaced together. The fuel filter is designed as a lifetime 
filter. 

The pressure regulator (21), a suction jet pump (17), fuel level sensor (19) and two non¬ 
return valves (18 +20) belong to the left-hand delivery unit. 

The lines of the three operational vent valves (22) are combined in the central constant 
pressure valve (Z-DHV) (27) to form one line which then leads to the refuelling vent valve 
(23). From here, the line leads to the fuel filler neck. 

From the fuel filler neck, a branch leads to the carbon canister (AKF). On the one hand, 
this branch is connected to the fuel tank leakage diagnostic module (DMTL) (6) and on 
the other hand via the purge air line (26) and the fuel tank vent valve (TEV) (25) to the 
engine intake system. 

The lockforthe service openings is new. A clip with a break-away nut ensures the 
correct forces are maintained in the sensitive system. The advantage is that it provides 
an outstanding seal.

Function 

The fuel pump (13) with intake filter (10) delivers the fuel directly into the fuel filter (7). 
The fuel then flows via the feed line (16) and a non-return valve (20) to the pressure 
regulator (21). The task of this non-return valve is to ensure that the feed line to the 
engine (27) does not run empty when the engine is turned off and thus secures the 
pressure in the feed line to the engine. 

The pressure regulator (21) ensures a constant pressure in the feed line to the engine 
and therefore also at the fuel injectors (3). Surplus fuel is conveyed by the pressure 
regulator along a return line (15) back into the swirl pot. 

A line branches from the feed line (16) forthe purpose of feeding the suction jet pump 
(17) in the left-hand tank half. This pump conveys fuel from the left-hand tank half via 
the compensation line (14) into the swirl pot. A non-return valve (18) from the suction 
jet pump (17) prevents the right-hand fuel tank emptying via the feed line (16) when the 
vehicle is parked on a slope. 

A line from the fuel filter leads directly to the suction jet pump (9) that fills the swirl pot. 

A non-return valve (12) upstream of this suction jet pump ensures that the swirl pot and 
the fuel filter are not emptied via the suction jet pump when the vehicle is parked on a 
slope. 

In the event of the swirl pot being completely empty, the initial filling valve (11) ensures 
fuel enters the swirl pot while refuelling. Ventilation of the fuel tank is ensured by three 
operational vent valves (22), the central constant pressure valve (Z-DHV) (27) and the 
refuelling vent valve (23). The three lines lead from the operational vent valves (22) to a 
manifold, i.e. the central constant pressure valve (27) and from here one line leads to the 
central refuelling vent valve (23). 

The central constant pressure valve also assumes the function of preventing overfilling. 
The refuelling vent valve ensures ventilation while refuelling. The fuel vapors are routed 
up to the filler pipe where they join the vapors that occur in the filler pipe while refuelling 
and then directed to the carbon canister (AKF) (6). 

Here, the air is separated from the fuel constituents. The air is given off via the fuel tank 
leakage diagnostic module (4) and a dust filter (5) into the atmosphere. The fuel con¬ 
stituents are fed via the fuel tank vent valve (25) to the engine intake system (2). 

Service Openings ofthe Fuel Tank 

The service openings feature a new lock system. The reason for introducing this system 
is to provide an improved seal to conform to stringent US emission laws.The service 
opening is closed off with a tensioning clip that must be tightened to a defined torque. 
This is achieved in the production plant by using a special tightening tool. As it is difficult 
to access, the tensioning clip has a break-away nut for service purposes. 

The tensioning clips and seals ofthe service openings must be replaced every time the 
system is opened.
