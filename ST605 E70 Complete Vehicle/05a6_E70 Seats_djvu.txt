Introduction 


Seat Equipment Options 

There is a comprehensive range of seat equipmentforthe E70. Essentially, there are 
three different seat models available. 

The seat models are: 

• Basic seat (NotforU.S. vehicles) 

• Sport seat option 

• M ultifunction seat (comfort seat) option. 

Semi-electric and electric versions of the basic seat are not offered in the U.S. 

An electric version of the sport seat is offered. The table below shows the different 
types of seat adjustmentforthe seat models.

Each has electric seat-height and backrest inclination adjustment. The seats can be 
expanded to include assorted electrical functions. These functions are listed in the table 
in the next page.

The front side airbag has been integrated in the backrest of the driver and front passen¬ 
ger seat. 


Note: Further information on the side airbag, seat-occupancy recognition and 
the belt tensioner can be found in the Product Information "Advanced 
Crash Safety ManagementE70". 


The multifunction seat can be ordered with the active-seat function. In contrast to the 
previous models, the seat cushion is moved no longer by electrohydraulic but rather by 
electro-pneumatic means. The advantage of electro-pneumatics lies in the fact that the 
overall weight of the seat is reduced.This in turn reduces fuel consumption and lowers 
damage to the environment by pollutants.

Second Row Seating 

The E70 is a five-seater in its standard equipment specification, two seats in the front 
(driver and Passenger) and three seats in the row just behind the front seats. This is 
refered to as second row seating (back seat). It offers the opportunity of folding down 
the backrest completely, thereby increasing the luggage-compartment volume.The 
backrest are divided into two parts, the ratio being 60/40.

Third Row Seating 

The Passenger seating capacity can be extended to seven by ordering the third row seat¬ 
ing option.The additional two seats are situated in the luggage compartment and can be 
folded down completely. 

This row of seats is refered to as third row seating or 5 +2 seat concept and are not 
equipped with seat heaters. However, an independent heating unit option is available just 
for the third row seats.

Driver Seat Adjustments 


The electric basic seat or electric sport seat can be electrically adjusted in the following 
directions: 

• Seat height 

• Seat distance to steering wheel (longitudinal seat adjustment) 

• Seat inclination 

• Backrest inclination 

• Head-rest height 

The seats can be electrically adjusted from "Terminal 30g ON".

Memory buttons 


A seat module activates the driver seat. The seat-adjustment switches signal the seat 
module the desired adjustment. The switches supply a defined voltage corresponding to 
the request. Based on these voltage values, the seat module determines which motor it 
must activate. Activation takes place via the relay in the seat module until the seat-adjust¬ 
ment switch is released orthe end of the adjustment travel is reached. 

The Hall sensors in the adjustment motors supply Hall pulses, which are evaluated by the 
seat module. The seat position is determined based on these Hall pulses. 

This function is used not only to detect the end stops but also to store the memory posi¬ 
tion of the driver seat. 

12 

E70 Seats 











A locked up motor is detected by means of the current-measurement function integrated 
in the seat module. In this case, the relays are no longer actuated thus shutting down the 
motors. 

The memory setting forthis motor is inhibited until the motor is no longer locked. 

Note: In the case of lumbar support seats, the seat-adjustment switches are no 
longer read directly by the seat module, as with the semi-electric basic 
seats.This means that the seat module is now connected with the S bus 
(K-bus protocol) to the seat-adjustment switches. 

Driver Seat Heating 

As on the semi-electric basic seat, the seat heating has two heating circuits. Each of the 
heating circuits has a heating areaforthe backrest and the seat cushion. The driver seat 
has the driver seat module (SMFA). 

The function of the seat heating is integrated completely in the seat module. The driver 
seat module is connected to terminal 30g forthe load current. 

When the vehicle wakes up, the junction-box ECU determines whethera driver seat 
module is installed in the vehicle. The junction-box ECU sends a query via the K-CAN for 
this purpose. The driver seat module, which is connected via the K-CAN, responds via 
the K-CAN.The junction-box ECU now knows that a driverseat module is installed in the 
vehicle. 

However, the seat heating can only be activated from the status "Terminal 15 ON".The 
status "Terminal 15 ON" is made available by the Car Access System 3 via the K-CAN. 

The seat-heating button is located in the control panel forthe integrated automatic heat¬ 
ing/air conditioning. When the seat heating button is pressed, the integrated automatic 
heating/air conditioning sends the heating-stage request via the K-CAN. 

The driverseat module evaluates the requestforthe desired heating stage actuates the 
seat heating accordingly. The driverseat module determines the set temperature by 
means of the NTC resistor in the heating mat of the seat surface. A fault in the seat-heat¬ 
ing system results in a corresponding entry in the fault memory of the driverseat module. 

Seat Heating Power Reduction 

The junction-box ECU makes the information for power reduction available on the K- 
CAN.The driverseat module receives the information via the K-CAN.The driverseat 
module reduces the heat output in accordance with the request. 


13 

E70 Seats 



The Power Reduction Stages Are: 

• Operation of seat heating in Stage 2 only 

• Operation of seat heating in Stage 2 at only 50% 

• Seat heating OFF 

Note: In the event of a power reduction, the LEDs of the seat-heating switch 
are not switched off. 

Driver Seat Lumbar Support 

The button for lumbar-support adjustment is located on the front of the seat (facing the 

door). If the vehicle has lumbar support, the front passenger seat receives a seat module. 
The function of the lumbar support is integrated completely in the seat module. 

The seat module evaluates the button for lumbar-support adjustment. Lumbar support is 
provided by two inflatable air cushions in the backrest. Each air cushion is inflated or 
deflated via two solenoid valves. 

The pump for lumbar-support adjustment delivers the required air pressure. The pump 
and the solenoid valves are actuated by the seat module until the required lumbar sup¬ 
port is established. 

Note: In the case of seats with lumbarsupport, the buttons for seat adjustment 
are connected via the S - bus seat bus (K- bus protocol) to the seat mod¬ 
ule. This also applies to seats with a memory function. 

Driver Seat Memory Function 

The memory function on the basic or sport electric seat is only available forthe driver 
seat.The memory buttons are located on the side ofthe driver seat. The memory func¬ 
tion can be activated as from "Terminal R ON ".Two memory positions and the current 
seat position can be stored. 

By pressing the memory button "M" followed by pressing button "1" or "2", the current 
position ofthe driver seat is assigned to the pressed button. 

At the same time, the current position ofthe door mirrors is also assigned to the selected 
button. The information for storing the door mirror position is sent by the driver seat mod¬ 
ule via the K-CAN. 

Note: The memory position of the door mirrors is stored inthefootwell module. 

Within the framework of Personal Profile, the data is assigned to the current remote con¬ 
trol key when the memory position is stored.

This circuit diagram features basic and sport, front passenger side seat, with seat heating 
and lumbarsupport. 

The seat bus is installed only from the lumbarsupport between the seat-adjustment 
switches (5) and the seat module (15). In the case of seats not equipped with lumbar 
support, the seat-adjustment switches signal the seat module directly. The seat adjust¬ 
ment switches are resistance-coded. 

Front Passenger Seat Adjustment 

The basic and sport seat can be electrically adjusted in the following directions: 

• Seat height 

• Seat distance to steering wheel (longitudinal seat adjustment) 

• Seat inclination 

• Backrest inclination 

• Head-rest height 

The seats can be electrically adjusted from "Terminal 30g ON".

E70 Seats 









































The front passenger side has a seat adjustment switch, from which the motors are direct¬ 
ly activated. Activation takes place until the seat-adjustment switch is released or the end 
of the adjustment travel is reached. 

The position of the front passengerseat is not stored and cannot be called up via

The switches forthe backrest and head rest can be moved in four directions. 

The switch forthe seat position can be moved in the following directions: 

• Seat forward or back, longitudinal seat adjustment 

• Seat high or low, seat-height adjustment 

• Seat inclination up or down (turn seat adjustment switch) 

Front Passenger Seat Heating 

As on the semi-electric basic seat, the front passenger seat heating has two heating cir¬ 
cuits. Each of the heating circuits has a heating area forthe backrest and the seat cush¬ 
ion. However, the front passengerseat has a seat-heating seat module.

Front Passenger Seat Lumbar Support 

If the front passenger seat features lumbar adjustment, it requires a seat module. The 
complete function is integrated in the seat module. The signals from the seat-adjustment 
switches and from the button for lumbar r support adjustment are interpreted by the seat 
module. The function is described in the section dealing with the basic and sport electric 
seat (driver's side). 

Front Passenger Seat Memory Function 

If the front passenger seat is equipped with a memory function, it requires a seat module. 
The signals from the seat-adjustment switches and from the button for lumbar support 
adjustment are received by the seat module via the S bus. The memory positions are 
stored in the front passenger seat module

Seat Adjustments 


The multifunction seat option contains the memory function forthe driver and front pas¬ 
senger seats. Multifunction seats can be electrically adjusted in the following directions: 

• Seat height 

• Seat distance to steering wheel (longitudinal seat adjustment) 

• Seat inclination 

• Backrest inclination 

• Head rest height 

• Backrest-head inclination 

• Seat depth 

• Backrest width 

Each multifunction seat has a seat module. All the seat-adjustment buttons are evaluated 
by the seat module. 

The buttons are connected via the S bus (seat bus on the basis of the K-bus protocol) to 
the seat module. 

The seat module is responsible forthe seat functions. It controls and monitors the func¬ 
tion sequences. Seat adjustment is possible as from "Terminal 30g ON". When the seat 
adjustment switches are operated, the seat module operates the motors to move the 
seat in the desired direction. The seat is moved by the motors until such the seat-adjust 
ment switch is released orthe seat 
reaches its adjustment limit. 

1) 2) f3) 

The seat positions are stored in the 
seat module.The seat module receives 
the signal from the backrest-width but¬ 
ton via the S bus. After it has been 
operated, the backrest-width switch 
always returns to its initial position. It is 
integrated in the side panel of the seat.

Seat Heating 

The seat heating forthe multifunction seat has four heating circuits. Each comprises one 
quick heating area and one residual heating area for backrest and seat cushion. Each 
heating area is provided with a temperature sensor. A maximum of two heating circuits 
are switched on simultaneously. 

The seat heating function is integrated completely in the seat module. The seat module 
is connected to terminal 30g forthe load current. 

When the vehicle wakes up, the junction-box ECU determines which seat module is 
installed in the vehicle. The junction-box ECU sends a query via the K-CAN forthis pur¬ 
pose. 

The driver and front passenger seat modules respond via the K-CAN. The junction-box 
ECU must registera response with in 200 ms.The junction-box ECU now knows that a 
driver seat module or a front passenger seat module is installed in the vehicle. 

However, the seat heating can only be activated from the status "Terminal 15 ON".The 
status "Terminal 15 ON" is made available by the Car Access System 3 via the K-CAN. 

The seat-heating button is located in the control panel forthe integrated automatic heat¬ 
ing/airconditioning (IHKA). When the seat heating button is pressed, the IHKA sends the 
heating-stage request via the K-CAN. 

1 J (2 i 

The driver seat module evaluates the 
request forthe desired heating stage 
and operates the seat heating accord- ( 
ingly. The driver seat module deter¬ 
mines the set temperature by means 
of the NTC resistor in the heating mat 
of the seat surface. A fault in the seat¬ 
heating system results in a corre¬ 
sponding entry in the fault memory of 
the driver seat module. 


Quick Heating Area 

When the seat heating is switched on, the quick heating areas are activated first in 
orderto warm the seats up quickly. 

Afterthe initial quick warm-up, the residual heating areas are switched on in orderto 
ensure uniform temperature distribution in the seat. 

Activation of all the heating areas is clocked so that a defined current intensity is not 
exceeded during residual heating. The duty cycle is dependent on the selected heating 
stage, the switch-on period and the heating area temperature.

Seat Heating Power Reduction 

The junction-box ECU makes the information for power reduction available on the 
K-CAN.The driver seat module and front passenger seat module receive the information 
via the K-CAN.The seat modules reduce the heat output in response to the request. 

The reduction stages were described in a previous section. 

Lumbar Support Function 

The lumbar support function is integrated completely in the seat module. The seat mod¬ 
ule evaluates the button for lumbar support adjustment. 

Lumbar support is provided by two inflatable air cushions in the backrest. Each air cush¬ 
ion is inflated or deflated via two solenoid valves. 

The pump and the solenoid valves for lumbar-support adjustment are actuated by the 
seat module until the required lumbar support is established to the desired level of com¬ 
fort . 

Seat Memory Function 

The memory function on the multifunction seat is available for the driver and front pas¬ 
senger seats only. The memory buttons are located on the sides of the seats. 

The memory function can be activated as from the status "Terminal R ON". Two memory 
positions and the current seat position can be stored by pressing the memory button "M" 
followed by pressing button "1" or "2", thus current position of the seat is assigned to the 
button. 

At the same time, the current position of the door mirrors is also assigned to the selected 
button. The information for storing the door mirror position is sent by the driver seat mod¬ 
ule via the K-CAN. 

Note: The memory position of the door mirrors is stored in the footwell module. 

Within the framework of Personal Profile, the data is assigned to the current remote con¬ 
trol key when the memory position is stored. 


26 

E70 Seats 



The full equipment specification of the multifunction seat contains the following options: 

• Active seat (US version) 

• Active seat ventilation 

The functions of the front passenger seats are identical to those of the driver seat. 
However, the front passenger seat does not contain the door-mirror memory function. 

Note:The US version of the front passengerseat has seat-occupancy recognition. For 
this reason, a US version of the active seat cannot be offered forthe front passengerseat. 

Active Seat 

The active seat is switched on by the button in the center-console switch center. The 
function operates when "Terminal 15 ON". 

The integrated automatic heating/air conditioning receives the signal from the center- 
console switch center and sends it via the K-CAN.The seat module thus receives the 
request and executes it. 

This function is derived from the E60. However, the active seat has a pneumatic sys- 
tem.The system uses the pump for lumbar-support adjustmentto deliverthe required 
amount of air into the seat cushion. 

Note: Lumbar-support adjustment has priority over the Active Seat. The pump runs at 
maximum speed forthe active-seat function and the pump for lumbar support adjustment 
runs at roughly half that speed. 

Note: Lumbar-support adjustment has priority overthe active seat. For Lumbar 
S upport adjustment, the pump runs at maximum speed. Forthe active- 
seat function, the pump for lumbar support adjustment runs at roughly 
half this speed

E70 Seats 





































Four air cushions are integrated in the seat surface forthe active seat. Two air cushions, 
one on top of the other, are used in both the left and right seat halves. 

The air cushions are inflated with air provided by the pump for lumbar-support adjust¬ 
ment. A solenoid valve is integrated in the pump unit. The function of the solenoid valve 
is to change overthe air supply. This ensures that only one function (lumbar-support 
adjustment or active seat) is ever executed. 

A distributor module is used for inflating the air cushions. The seat module delivers power 
to the distributor module as soon as the active seat is switched on. 

The distributor module houses a motor, which drives an eccentric shaft. The rotation of 
the eccentric shaft causes the air inlets to the seat cushions to open or close. 

The seat cushions are alternately inflated or deflated, depending on the position of the 
eccentric shaft. The air inlets are closed when the system is switched off and in the 
breaks between inflation or deflation. 

A switch contact is integrated in the distributor module to switch on the pump for lumbar 
support adjustment. The rotation of the eccentric shaft actuates the contact, which there¬ 
by signals activation to the seat module. The seat module switches on the pump for lum¬ 
bar-support adjustment and changes the solenoid valve to inflate the seat cushions. 

Low Voltage 

If the function fails due to low voltage when the active seat is switched on, the active seat 
must be calibrated. The function does this by itself. The seat cushions are completely 
deflated the next time the active seat is switched on. The active seat function is then 
ready for operation again. 

In the event of a fault, the system shuts down or stop in the next center position in order 
to avoid further damage. In the interest of avoiding irritation when cornering at high 
speed, the active-seat function is stopped immediately in the event of excessive lateral 
acceleration. 

The lateral-acceleration signal comes from the yaw-rate sensor. Dynamic Stability Control 
evaluates the signals from the yaw-rate sensor and sends them via the PT-CAN. 

The junction-box ECU makes the signals available on the K-CAN. In this way, the seat 
module receives the signal forthe vehicle's lateral acceleration. Activation of the active 
seat is reversed by the seat module from a defined threshold. The active seat is switched 
on again when the lateral-acceleration value drops again.

Active Seat Ventilation 


The active seat ventilation option allows the occupants to cool the seat surfaces and 
backrest individually. 

Active seat ventilation is available for both driver and front passenger seats. Active seat 
ventilation can be activated as from the status "Terminal 15 ON". 

Stage 3 is engaged when the button is pressed forthe first time. This means a high fan 
stage for seat and backrest. By pressing the button a second and third time lower stages 
of cooling are achieved. By pressing the button a even further will shut OFF the system. 
Active seat ventilation is deactivated if the button remains pressed for longer than 1.2

Pressing the button results in a menu being brought up in the Central Information 
Display. The individual air-conditioning stages can be selected from this menu, for exam¬ 
ple when the button is pressed again. An LED on the button indicates when active seat 
ventilation is switched on. 

The integrated automatic heating/air conditioning evaluates the signals for operating 
active seat ventilation. The request is sent via the K-CAN.The seat module thus receives 
the request and executes it. The seat module activates and monitors the fans. 

Nine fans are accommodated in each seat. The fans are switched on by the seat module 
and activated separately for backrest and seat surface. For active ventilation, the seat has 
two speed stages forthe fans, depending on the air-conditioning stage. The seat surface 
has five fans, while the backrest has four fans. 


32 

E70 Seats 












After having been activated fora period in excess of 15 minutes, active seat ventilation 
is automatically switched back from Stage 3 to Stage 2. 

The function of activated seat ventilation remains stored for up to 15 minutes afterthe 
status "Terminal 15 OFF". Active seat ventilation is switched on again if in this time the 
status "Terminal 15 ON" is received by the seat module. 

The energy management system in the vehicle can deactivate active seat ventilation 
briefly depending on the vehicle's energy balance. The function indicator is retained 
however.

Second Row Seats (Rear Seat) 


The Seat heating option is also available for second row seats. Seat heating is an option 
The seat heating option cannot be ordered individually.This means that it can only be 
ordered in conjunction with the Front Seat-heating option. 

Seat heating forthe second row is available in two equipment specifications: 

• Rear Seat heating without automatic rear-cabin air conditioning 

• Rear Seat heating with automatic rear-cabin air conditioning 

Rear Seat Heating w/out Automatic Rear-cabin Air Conditioning 

The seat heating features two heating 
circuits each in the right and left seat 
halves. Each ofthe heating circuits has 
a heating area forthe backrest and the 
seat cushion. 

The seat heating is connected to the 
"Terminal 15" relay.The seat heating 
can therefore only be activated from 
"Terminal 15 ON".The seat heating 
can be switched on individually forthe 
left or right seat half with buttons. 

The seat-heating buttons are integrat¬ 
ed underthe air vents in the rear cen¬ 
ter console.

Note: The Car Access System 3 actuates a relay in the front distribution box. 
The front distribution box is thus supplied with "Terminal 15 ON" (7). 

The Terminal 15 relay (5) among others is connected to this supply. 

Rear Seat Heating w/Automatic Rear-cabin AirConditioning 

The seat heating has two heating circuits, as described above. It does, however, have a 
seat-heating seat module. 

The function of the seat heating is integrated completely in the seat-heating seat module. 
The seat-heating seat module is connected to terminal 30 forthe load current. 

The seat heating can be activated from the status "Terminal 15 ON". Automatic rear 
cabin air conditioning receives the status "Terminal 15 ON" via the K-CAN. 

The buttons for operating the seat heating are integrated in the control panel for automat¬ 
ic rear-cabin air conditioning. The automatic rear-cabin air conditioning ECU evaluates the 
buttons and activates the seat heating depending on the selected heating stage. 

The seat-heating seat module is supplied with a pulse-width-modulated signal forthis 
purpose.The pulse width corresponds to the required heating stage. 

The seat-heating seat module executes the request and monitors the seat heating. The 
seat-heating seat module determines the set temperature by means of an NTC resistor in 
the heating mat of the seat surface.

Second Row Seat Locking 

The locking function of the seat bench in the second seat row is monitored. For 

example, a locked seat bench ensures that it cannot come loose during driving and result 
in passenger injuries. 

The second row seats are divided into a large and a small seat sections. The ratio is 60- 
40.Therefore, the large seat portion has four M icros-witches while the small seat portion 
has one M icro-switch for monitoring the lock. 

The junction-box ECU issues a signal as soon as the contact to the ground connection is 
interrupted. The signal alerts the customerthatthe second row is not locked correctly. 

The Large Seat Section 

M icros-witches are installed forthe backrest and seat surface for monitoring the large 
seat section. On the backrest there is only one M icro-switch, on the outside. 

There are two further M icros-witches in the seat bottom, on the inside and outside of the 
locks. Another M icro-switch is located on the seat-cushion arm in the seat bottom to 
detect when the backrest is in the fully set-down in position and locked. 

All the switches are closed when the seat section is correctly locked. One of the switches 
of a locked seat is always open or closed. The following seat states are monitored: 

• Large seat half, backrest, folded up and locked 

• Large seat half, backrest, folded down 

• Large seat half, seat surface tilted 

• Large seat half, seat surface locked 

The Small SeatSection 

The small seat section is monitored by a M icro-switch, since there is no belt integrated in 
the backrest. The Micro-switch is situated on the mechanical lock on the inside of the 
seat bottom. The switch is closed when this seat is correctly locked.

J unction-Box ECU 

The junction-box ECU is the monitoring electronic control unit. In the event of an incor¬ 
rectly locked seat, the junction-box ECU no longer has ground contact with this pin. 

The signal level therefore changes from Low to High.The junction-box ECU issues a 
check control message and alerts the driverto an unlocked seat.

Third Row Seat 


The seat concept described above can be extended by the 5+2 seat concept. This is 
available as the 5+2 seat-extension option. The additional two seats are situated in the 
luggage compartment and can be folded down completely. This seat row is the third row 
in the E70. 

These seats are not equipped with seat heating. However, an independent heating option 
is available forthe third row. More information can be found in the Product Information 
"E70 Heating / AirConditioning". 

Seat-position recognition, US version 

The US version of the driver seat has seat position recognition. Seat-position recognition 
indicates where longitudinally the seat is situated (distance to the steering wheel). In this 
way, the distance between the driver and the steering wheel can be detected. 

The ACSM requires this information so that it can fire the airbag under defined condi¬ 
tions. A more detailed description can be found in the Product Information "E70 
Advanced Crash Safety Management". 

Seat-position recognition is calibrated at the factory. The positions in the front and rear 
longitudinal seat direction are known to the seat module. A maximum distance is available 
for longitudinal seat adjustment. 

This stretches from the mechanical front stop to the mechanical rear stop. The motorfor 
adjustment in the longitudinal direction generates Hall pulses overthis distance. The seat 
modules uses these Hall pulses to identify the current (absolute) seat position. 

An area for example in which a person of short stature would sit is defined in the longitu¬ 
dinal direction. The absolute seat position can be lost due to specific causes. The seat 
must therefore be calibrated. Please referto the Service Information.

E70 Seats 



Service Information 


Calibration of US-Version Driver Seat 

The position ofthe driver seat in the longitudinal direction can become implausible in the 
course of that seat's life. This can be caused by repeatedly moving the seat forward and 
back in the longitudinal direction. 

These movements can give rise to an unauthorized position delta which no longer pro¬ 
vides fora determination ofthe seat position. 

The seat must therefore be recalibrated. Calibration is easy and can be performed by the 
customer him-/herself. Please referto the Owner's Handbook. 

Note: The seat must be moved in the mechanical front stop. Then the seat is 
calibrated and can be adjusted in the desired seat position. 

If the seat is unable to reach the mechanical front stop, the calibration must be per¬ 
formed in the service garage/workshop. 

This situation can come about if, a coin is stuck in the seat-adjustment rail and blocks 
the adjustment travel. 

When repairs are made to the seat, the seat must always be calibrated. This is necessary 
to guarantee seat-position recognition, or more precisely to increase the safe and reliable 
function of seat-position recognition. 

Switching the seat ECU fortest purposes for example with one from anothervehicle is 
possible. The seat calibration will be lost however. Because the possibility ofthe calibra¬ 
tion being in orderwhen the old seat ECU is reinstalled cannot be ruled out, it is neces¬ 
sary to calibrate the seat. Referto the repair instructions for seat calibration.

E70 Seats 














Note: The ACSM receives from the seat ECU via the K-CAN a message once 
a second as to whether calibration of the seat is necessary. 

As soon as the message contains the information "Calibrating necessary", the ACSM 
outputs a check control message via the K-CAN to the instrument cluster. 

The seat ECU can likewise triggerthe check control message.This is possible if for 
instance the Hall sensor of the longitudinal drive motor is defective. A repair in the garage/ 
workshop will therefore be necessary. The seat must be calibrated after the repair.
