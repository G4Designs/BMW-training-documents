Note: The HiFi and CHAMP systems are standard equipmenton US 

vehicles.The rear seat entertainment is available in conjunction with 
the HiFi system and the Top-HiFi system. 

The commands entered using the remote control of the rear seat entertainment are 
transferred via the transmission frequency, which is also used for the radio remote control 
key function. 

The frequency used is dependent on the national variant and therefore relevant for cod¬ 
ing. and therefore relevant for coding. 

The commands are received by the FBD aerial and routed via the antenna amplifierwith 
diversity module to the CAS3.The CAS3 converts the signals into K-CAN messages. 
The commands then reach the RSE control unit via the K-CAN. 

If audio is played back via the audio speakers in the vehicle, the audio signal is routed 
from the RSE control unit via the AUX_NF cables and via the audio socket to the radio or 
navigation system AuxJn.The audio socket is standard equipment in the E70 and fitted 
underthe center armrest. The connection to the RSE control unit is disconnected manu¬ 
ally by connection of an external item of equipments the audio socket. 

Other external items of equipment can be connected via the AV input to the RS E control 
unit. 

The programming, coding and diagnostics forthe rear seat entertainment are performed 
via the K-C AN. The terminal status is also transferred as a K-CAN message.

The E70 rear seat entertainment comes with the 'Professional' radio, and CHAM P is fit¬ 
ted as the "Professional"' radio option on US vehicles. 

Note: Audio is played back either through the audio speakers in the vehicle or 
via the headphones. The road speed dependent volume control will only 
affectthe audio playbackthroughthe speakers and not the headphones 

The wheel speed signals are routed from the DSC control unit to the PT-CAN and con¬ 
verted in the J unction-box ECU (J B) to the K-CAN protocol. The instrument cluster 
processes the road-speed signal and makes it available on the K-CAN. 

The volume of the speakers can be set using the buttons on the steering wheel orthe 
headset. If audio is played back via the headphones, the volume can be adjusted either 
on the headphones (infrared headphones) or using the remote control (wired head¬ 
phones).

• Switch off by turning 

• Switch on by folding out and turning 

• Plugs for K-CAN, LVDS, infrared transmitter. 

The rear display is switched on by folding it up and turning it counterclockwise into pos 
tion.The RSE control unit is switched on when the reardisplay is switched on.Turning 
the reardisplay actuates a microswitch located in the swivel joint. The reardisplay is 
switched off by turning it clockwise or by switching the RSE control unitoff. Folding down 
the reardisplay does not switch off the RSE control unit, because the CD audio function 
must be maintained. 

The reardisplay photodiode aids brightness control. 

I nf ra red Tra n s m itte r 

The infrared transmitter consists of seven infrared diode and is located in the base of the 
reardisplay behind a Makrolon panel. The infrared transmitter is supplied with powerfrom 
the RSE control unit.The infrared diode therefore light up foras long as the RSE control 
unit can be activated oris active. The infrared diode go out when the RSE control unit is 
OFF and the run-on time of 30 minutes afterterminal R has switched off.. 

To insure perfect function of the infrared headphones, note the following: 

• Eye contact between the receiver on the headphones and the infrared transmitter 

• M akrolon panel on the infrared transmitter is clean and free from scratches. 

Remote Control 

The function LED lights up after actuation of each button to check the transmission func¬ 
tion. This confirms sending of a radio signal. The remote control signals are only convert¬ 
ed if the rear seat entertainment is activated. 

The thumbwheel, the confirmation button and the cross-control key represent the con- 
trollerfunctions. Turning the thumbwheel corresponds to turning the controller. Sliding 
the controllerto the left, right, forwards or back is replaced by pressing the corresponding 
button on the cross-control key. Pressing the controller corresponds to pressing the con¬ 
firmation button. The remote control only controls the rear seat entertainment. 

By pressing the start menu button, the rear seat entertainment start menu is displayed in 
the reardisplay. For further information on operation ofthe rear seat entertainment, 
please referto the Owner's Handbook.

Service Information 


Diagnosis 

The BMW diagnostic system contains the diagnostics for the rear seat entertainment 
under "Rear Seat Entertainment". Test plans and control unit functions forthe following 

components are available: 

• RSE powersupply 

• Rear seat entertainment control unit 

• Headphones 

• Remote control 

• RD powersupply. 

The RSE control unit and RD rear display are the control units available. 

Teaching-in the remote control 

There is a test plan forteaching-in the remote control in the diagnostics under 
Rear Seat Entertainment. 

The test plan works through the following steps: 

• The entry of the current detected remote control forthe rear seat entertainment 
is deleted in CAS3. 

• The remote control forthe rear seat entertainment is taught in. 

• Successful teaching-in of the remote control is acknowledged by the automatic 
closing and opening of the central locking. 

Note: Remote controls are not interchangeable. Only the taught-in remote 
control is functional in the vehicle. 

Programming and Coding 

The RSE control unit can be programmed and coded.The DVD area code can be 
changed during coding only if mileage is below 60 miles on the odometer. 


21 

E70 Rear Seat Entertainment 





DVD Area Code 

DVD area codes were introduced to restrict playback of DVDs to particular markets. As a 
rule, DVDs appear in one region before they do in another region. The earth has been 
divided into different regions and an area code has been assigned to each region: 


Area code 

Region 

Region 1 

Canada, USA and US territories 

Region 2 

Europe,J apan, Middle East, Egypt, South Africa, Greenland 

Region 3 

South-east Asia including Hong Kong and South Korea 

Region 4 

Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Pacific Islands 

Region 5 

FormerCIS states, Indian subcontinent, Mongolia, North Korea, 

Africa (excluding Egypt and South Africa) 

Region 6 

China 


So that the area code functions, each DVD player is equipped with its own area code, 
determining for which market the device is intended. European devices are preset with 
area code 2, whereas American devices have area code 1. Each DVD can have one or 
more area codes, depending on the region(s) for which it is intended. Area code 0 identi¬ 
fies DVDs that are released for all regions. It is also possible that DVDs are released for 
particular regions, like 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 - all countries excluding the USA. 

When inserting a DVD, the RSE control unit checks whetherthe region defined in the 
control unit matches the DVD country code. In this way, you can control which country 
the DVD can be played in. The RSE control unit permits a maximum of five area code 
changes, then the area code of the DVD most recently inserted is stored in the RSE con¬ 
trol unit. As a result, only DVDs with the area code defined in the RS E control unit can 
then be played. 

The number of changes still possible and the area code currently set can be issued in the 
BMW diagnostic system under RSE control unit functions. 

The area codes are set by coding the RSE control unit. Changing the area code in the 
control unit by coding reduces the number of possible area code changes. If changes are 
no longer possible, the control unit must be replaced when a DVD with a different area 
code is to be played.
