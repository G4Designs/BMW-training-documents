Driving Dynamics 


Certain dynamic influences cause movements in the vehicle body. These movements 
can be subdivided into and represented as three categories. 

A coordinate system can be constructed for this with three spatial coordinate axes, 
which allows this degree offreedom to be defined.

Yawing (about the vertical axis)

Pitching (aboutthe vertical axis) 




• Longitudinal dynamics: 

The main direction of movement and the direction of travel is defined by the xor 
longitudinal axis ofthe coordinate system. Situations involving longitudinal dynam¬ 
ics, such as accelerating or braking, cause the vehicle to pitch and result in a move¬ 
ment about the y axis. 

• Lateral dynamics: 

Lateral dynamics occur when the direction of movement is along the y or lateral 
axis, as is the case with steering or swerving. This causes, among otherthings, the 
vehicle to roll and move about the xaxis.

E70 Chassis Dynamics 












Vertical Dynamics 

If the body moves along the z or vertical axis, this is known as vertical dynamics and 
constitutes oscillating up and down movements of the body, e.g. when "kangarooing” the 
vehicle. 

If there is still movement about the z or vertical axis of the vehicle, this is known as 
yawing. This type of movement occurs during understeer or oversteer and is demon¬ 
strated by drifting when the vehicle is being driven sportily, for example. 

These basic dynamic characteristics depend specifically on the following vehicle 
dimensions.

The position of the center of gravity in the vehicle, its distance from the road surface, the 
wheelbase and the track width are decisive geometric parameters that shape the 
dynamic behavior of a vehicle.

Forces at the Wheel 

The forces acting on the contact surface between the tire and the road are also 
subdivided into the three main directions.

The vertical force is fundamental. This acts vertically to the road and corresponds to the 
load on the tire. The maximum transferable lateral and tangential tire forces are the prod¬ 
uct of the vertical force and the adhesion coefficient. 


The radius of the Kamm's circle shows this mathematical relationship graphically. It is 
also possible to see the dependency between the tangential and lateral forces in the 
Kamm's circle. 


5 

E70 Chassis Dynamics 





















■ Explanation of the Kamm's Circle using an Example 

If a lateral tire force is acting on the wheel, a braking or accelerating force (tangential tire 
force) can only build up in a longitudinal direction up to the maximum total force (resulting 
force on surface). When this is reached, the wheel locks or spins. 

Conversely, only a limited lateral cornering force (lateral tire force) can be achieved under 
braking. If this is exceeded, the wheel slips in a lateral direction. This causes the vehicle 
to skid. If a braking force takes effect, the full lateral cornering force can be established in 
accordance with the radius of the Kamm's circle. 

In the same way, the full braking or acceleration force can be established when the 
vehicle is driving straightahead (again according to the radius). 

This relationship shows that acceleration or braking that is too rapid under cornering can 
cause the vehicle to skid, as any longitudinal force on the wheel, whether it serves to 
accelerate or brake, inevitably results in a failure of the lateral cornering forces. 

The radius of the Kamm's circle depends on the friction coefficient between the tire and 
the road, i.e. on the tire, the road surface and the road conditions. If the road is wet, for 
example, the radius is considerably smaller than if the road is dry. 

Interrelationships between the effects of the dynamic driving systems 

The possible effectiveness of modern dynamic driving systems is based only on the 
interrelationship between the tires and the road. 

In orderto classify and differentiate between the many systems in the E70, they are 
described in three separate Reference Information documents: 

• E70 longitudinal dynamics systems - The following dynamic driving systems act on 
the tangential wheel forces: 

- ABS 

- ASC 

- DSC 

- MSR 

These influence the translatory (longitudinal) movement along the xaxis and the rotational 
movement about the y axis. 

• E70 lateral dynamics systems - Lateral wheel forces are primarily generated by the 
steering angle, i.e. they are influenced by the power steering and Active Steering on 
the front axle. The most significant effect occurs as a rotational movement about the 
z axis. 

• E70 vertical dynamics systems - The following essentially act upon the vertical 
wheel forces and the wheel contact forces: 

- VDC 

- EHB 

- ARS 


6 

E70 Chassis Dynamics 



This affects the translatory movement along the z axis and, depending on the system, the 
rotational movement about the x axis for ARS or about the y axis for EHC. 

Furthermore, the rotational movement about the z axis due to altered wheel contact 
forces is also influenced by ARS (actual dynamic significance of the anti-roll bar). 

The complexity of the relationships and the reciprocal influencing of the tire forces and 
therefore the vehicle movement should be made clearer by the following graphic.

E70 Chassis and Suspension 


Through intelligent design layout and optimum package space utilization on the E70, 
the basis has been created for distinctly increasing the driving dynamics while improving 
comfort and vehicle handling. At virtually identical wheel loads, a greatertrack width and 
a larger wheelbase have been realized compared to the predecessor, the E53. 

While essentially retaining the same center of gravity, the best prerequisites have been 
created for meeting the target "Best in segment" with the new chassis and 
suspension of the E70.

T rac k Width, G eneral 

The size of the track width at the front and rear has a decisive influence on the cornering 
characteristics of the vehicle and its tendency to roll. 

• The track width should be as large as possible, however, it cannot exceed a defined 
value in relationship to the width of the vehicle. 

• The fully deflected (spring compressed) wheel turned at full lock on the front axle 
must not scrape or snag in the wheel arch cutout. 

• A certain degree of clearance for fitting snow chains is required on the drive axle 
(irrespective of whether this is the front, rear or both axles). 

• The wheels must not make contact with any chassis or body parts when the 
suspension springs fully compress and rebound. 

Wheelbase, General 

The wheelbase - measured from the center of the front axle to the center of the rear axle 
has a decisive influence on the vehicle handling properties. 

A large wheelbase compared to the length of the vehicle permits favorable accommoda¬ 
tion of the vehicle occupants between the axles and reduces the influence of the vehicle 
load on the overall load distribution. Short body overhang at the front and rear reduces 
the pitching tendency. 

A short wheelbase, on the other hand, provides favorable cornering characteristics, i.e. a 
smaller turning circle at the same steering lock angle. 

The outstandingly balanced values on the E70 result in safe, superior and agile vehicle 
handling characteristics that represent the standard in the SAV class (SAV = Sports 
Activity Vehicle) also for the future. These technical data are the prerequisite for achieving 
the top position in its class. In terms of driving dynamics, the E70 will assume a leading 
position without forfeiting driving and rolling comfort compared to the competition (with 
comparable equipment).

Front Axle 

Forthe first time on a BMW vehicle, a double wishbone front axle is used on the E70. 
The outstanding driving dynamics, the excellent driving comfort as well as the stable 
straight-ahead running properties are factors of this design solution that contribute to a 
high degree of driving pleasure and safety while making the vehicle ideal for every day 
use and providing the most relaxing drive on long journeys. 

Rear Axle 

Compared to the E53, the further-developed integral IV rear axle in the E70 is character¬ 
ized by further improved driving dynamics without compromising comfort and driving 
safety. This axle design on the E70 has made it possible to increase the width and depth 
of the load area. 

The result is a considerably larger and more functional load space (third row of seats) 
particularly through the use of the single-axle air spring (rear axle air suspension). This 
design layout guarantees brilliant road handling characteristics irrespective of the vehicle 
load and at a constant ride height. 


11 

E70 Chassis Dynamics 

















Dampers/Suspension 

In the E70, the range of spring/damper units extends from steel springs with conventional 
dampers through to the new vertical dynamic control (VDC)that, in addition to the elec¬ 
tronically controlled dampers, also allows a combination of a 1-axis air spring on the rear 
axle. This 1-axis air spring is compulsory on vehicles with 8-cylinder engines and/ora 
third row of seats. 

Brakes 

The brake system installed on the E70 is a further-developed high performance brake 
system with newly adapted dimensions forthe E70. The service brake is based on the 
conventional design while in contrast to the E53 the parking brake features an 
electro-mechanical parking brake system (EMF). 

Steering 

The E70 is available with two steering system variants: 

• Hydraulic power steering 

• Active steering (AL) 

Both steering systems are adapted to the diverse and varied possible applications of the 
E70 and the active steering is used forthe first time in an all-wheel drive vehicle. 

Wheels and Tires 

The E70 is the first all-wheel drive vehicle (X-family) that is equipped with a run flat safety 
package as standard.

The introduction of a second control arm level forwheel control, which is arranged above 
the wheel, results in additional degrees of freedom forthe kinematics of the front axle as 
well as forthe suspension/damping compared to other designs such as a McPherson 
strut axle. 

Components with special materials (see graphic on previous page): 

• The forged aluminum swivel bearing (6) with the 3rd generation wheel bearing (7) 
Semi-trailing arm connected via steel bushes/tapered screw connection to the swivel 
bearing. Attention: Referto special repair instructions! 

• The A-arm at the top (4) is made from forged aluminum and the cylindrical joint pin 
is clamped in the swivel bearing (6). 

• Tension strut with hydraulic mount (9) and bottom control arm (10) are forged steel 
components while the bottom control arm bears the spring strut (3) by means of the 
cast steel spring strut fork (11). 

• The front axle subframe is a welded steel structure with an aluminum thrust panel for 
maximum lateral stiffness with service openings. 


14 

E70 Chassis Dynamics 



Virtual Pivot Point 

The steering pivot axis of the wheel suspension is now formed by a joint at the top A-arm 
and the virtual pivot point of the lower arm level as known from the spring strut or 
McPherson axle. 



15 

E70 Chassis Dynamics 



























































































The steering pivot axis is therefore freely selectable and can be positioned such as to 
produce a small disturbing force lever arm with sufficient weight recoil. This disturbing 
force lever arm is decisive for transmitting the irregularities on the road surface to the 
steering wheel. The upper and lower arm level now move simultaneously in response to 
wheel lift so as to swivel the wheel during spring deflection in such a way that the 
negative camber with respect to the road is not reduced as much as on a McPherson 
strut suspension setup. 

Since the two control arm levels undertake the wheel control, the damper is no longer 
subjected to transverse forces. This makes it possible to do without a roller bearing 
assembly as the strut mount on the spring strut support. Instead of this conventional 
roller bearing, two PUR discs (hybrid bearing) are fitted above and below the spring strut 
mount. 

Due to the substantially lowerfriction, the damper can respond more sensitively to 
unevenness of the road surface. Due to the lack of transverse forces, the piston rod can 
be made thinner, resulting in a similar displacement volume in the push and pull direction 
of the damper. This serves to improve the design layout of the damper and is the 
pre-requisite forthe innovative damper control system - vertical dynamic control (VDC). 

By connecting the anti-roll bar via the stabilizer link to the swivel bearing, the torsion in 
response to body roll motion is equivalent to the total wheel lift from the inside to the 
outside of the curve (in other suspension setups, the anti-roll bars are connected to a 
control arm and therefore achieve only a fraction of the torsion angle). Despite being 
highly effective, this high degree of torsion allows forthe anti-roll bar to be made relatively 
thin which has a favorable effect on driving comfort and dynamics as well as saving 
weight. 

Cast Aluminum Spring Support (body side) 

The spring support on the E53 was not yet made of aluminum but rather from a conven¬ 
tional sheet metal shell construction. On the E70, a cast aluminum spring support is 
used forthe first time in the front end of the X-Series with the following advantages: 

• Reduced weight through intelligent lightweight construction 

• Improved driving dynamics thanks to higher degree of stiffness 

• Less components therefore reduced manufacturing expenditure 

The cast aluminum spring support takes up the forces from the chassis and suspension 
and directs them into the car body. Both the spring strut as well as the upper control arm 
are secured to the cast spring support. The component must exhibit a high degree of 
stiffness forthis purpose. This is achieved by optimum material distribution by ensuring 
material is only accumulated where necessary. 


16 

E70 Chassis Dynamics 



The spring support therefore represents an important contribution to controlling driving 
characteristics as it takes up both static and dynamic wheel forces. Since, with the cast 
construction, it is possible to integrate many individual functions and components in one 
single component, compared to the conventional shell construction, this setup is distinct¬ 
ly more compact while making a significant contribution to reducing weight. 

• The cast aluminum lightweight construction reduces the weight by approximately 
50% compared to the conventional sheet steel construction. 

• M ore useful package space compared to conventional sheet steel construction - 
80 mm shorter front end 

• Function-compliant design with specific local stiffening points adding to lightweight 
construction 

• Integration of various brackets for mounting units etc. in the cast aluminum spring 
support with add-on parts 

The cast aluminum spring support is connected to the neighboring steel components 
(e.g. engine support) by means of a rivet-adhesion structure. The structure is of lower 
weight while making it possible to reduce the number of parts (no additional sheet metal 
brackets). Nevertheless, the vehicle body is more stable and torsionally rigid while 
increasing local stiffness. This design arrangement has a positive effect on improved 
driving dynamics.

Rear Axle 


The integral IV rear axle fitted in the E70 fulfills the primary function of the running gear 
and wheel control in a unique way while making a significant contribution to driving 
dynamics. 

Safety functions are defined by the superior vehicle control characteristics. Effective 
de-coupling of the road and drive train guarantees outstanding levels of acoustic and 
vibration comfort.

The principle of the integral IV rear axle makes it possible to resolve the conflict between 
driving dynamics and comfort. The dynamic and drive forces applied through the wheel 
contact point into the wheel suspension are taken up by the wheel carrier, rear axle carrier 
and four control arms. The design layout reduces the flexible pulling action in the wheel 
carrier and therefore enables lengthways damping of the wheel control, which is 
important for rolling comfort, by means of soft front link brackets on the rear axle carrier. 


18 

E70 Chassis Dynamics 



















Thanks to the position of the spring on the wheel carrier, it is no longer necessary to 
support the weight of the vehicle on the rubber mounts on the rear axle carrier. 

The optimum lengthways clamping and the favorable spring position facilitate effective 
isolation of rolling and drive noise while significantly contributing to the refined smooth 
and quiet vehicle running characteristics. 

The rear axle ofthe E53 has undergone consistent further development for the E70 and 
adapted to the requirements ofthe larger dimensions, higher overall weight, increased 
power/torque, the BMW run flat safety system and the demanding objectives in terms of 
driving dynamics and comfort. The main criteria that governed the selection of materials 
included component weight, production process (cold forming, casting properties, weld¬ 
ing properties), strength and deformation characteristics as well as corrosion resistance. 

The resulting advantages include: 

Outstanding driving dynamics, further increased compared to the E53, without compro¬ 
mising comfort and driving safety. 

• Distinctly larger and more functional load area by increasing the effective load width 
and depth. 

• Level control (1-axis air suspension) ensures constant ride-height and driving charac¬ 
teristics irrespective ofthe vehicle load.

Crash position (80-mm compressed) 


A special feature of the adjustable steering column on the E70 is the innovative crash 
system consisting of a crash adapter and crash tube. In the event of a crash, the impact 
energy is progressively reduced for the driver by the crash tube breaking open and 
deforming, thus providing the advantage of reduced stress on the occupants in the event 
of a crash (integral part of the 5-star philosophy at BMW). In addition, the lower and cen¬ 
tersteering shaft collapses during the crash thus preventing penetration of the steering 
column into the passenger compartment. 

Advantages ofthis new steering column: 

• Low risk of injury in the event of a crash 

• Thanks to its versatile adjustment options, the steering column provides excellent 
ergonomic positioning for the driver. 

Wheels and Tires 

Forthe first time, an X-vehicle is equipped as standard with the run flat safety system. 
Tyre damage and tire failure are among the most feared driving experiences. 

The BMW run flat safety system: 

• Warns the driver in good time of imminent tire pressure loss so that counter-mea¬ 
sure can be taken. 

• Allows the journey to be continued for a defined distance even in the event of 
complete loss of tire pressure. 

• Keeps the tire safely on the rim even in the event of sudden tire pressure loss at 
high speed. 


22 

E70 Chassis Dynamics 






















The system consisting of the run flat tires (RSC), rims with extended hump (EH2+) con¬ 
tour and the electronic monitoring system (TPMS), renders a spare wheel or space-saver 
wheel, breakdown kit or vehicle jack unnecessary and this creates more storage space in 
the luggage compartment while also saving weight. 

Extended Hump Rims (EH2+) 

The specially shaped rim humps ensure that the RSC tire cannot detach from the rim 
even in the case of sudden tire pressure loss. This means substantially greater safety 
particularly when driving at high speed and on winding roads. 

Tire Failure indicator RPA 

The electronic monitoring system RPA monitors the tire pressure by constantly 
comparing the wheel speeds (dynamic rolling circumference). A warning lamp informs 
the driver of any irregularities that occur due to the loss of tire pressure. The system 
triggers a warning as from a vehicle speed of 25 km/h and at a pressure drop of more 
than 30%. 

The RPA system is designed to signal a sudden and excessive loss of pressure and does 
not exempt the driver from regularly checking the tire pressure. After changing the tire 
pressure or after changing a tire, the RPA must be re-initialized in orderto restore the 
target values with the correct tire pressure. 

The entire safety package consists of three components: 

• RSC tires with emergency running properties 

• Extended hump rims (EH2+) 

• Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). 

RSC tires with emergency running properties 

With its reinforced side walls, additional strip inserts and heat-resistant rubber mixtures, 
even when completely depressurized, the "self-supporting tire" makes it possible to 
continue the journey for a limited distance at a maximum speed of 80 km/h. This means 
each tire is also its own spare wheel. 

The maximum range after complete tire pressure loss is: 

• approximately 250 km at low vehicle load 

• approximately 150 km at medium vehicle load 

• approximately 50 km at high vehicle load 

In the case of slow pressure loss, i.e. representative of approximately 80% of all tire failure 
cases, the remaining range as from the RPA warning is approximately 2000 km. ABS, 
ASC and DSC remain fully operational even in the event of complete tire pressure loss. 

When driving with a run flat tire with no pressure, the optionally available adaptive drive 
system automatically distributes the vehicle weight over the remaining wheels so as to 
relieve the load on the depressurized tire with the aim of achieving the highest possible 
range for continued operation.
