Glovebox with Two Lids 


A new feature in the E70 is a glovebox with a lid split into two sections. The two-section 
lid can be electrically unlocked at the touch of a button. After being unlocked, the lids 
are automatically opened by spring force. 

Activation is triggered by a button. The button is located below the centre airvent in the 
instrument panel. To close, it is sufficientto press one lid only in the "CLOSED" direc¬ 
tion. The other lid is automatically closed in the same process. The lids snap into place 
in the lock in the "CLOSED" end position. 

Depending on the vehicle order, a CD changerorDVD changer can be installed in the 
glovebox.

Closing and Opening Glovebox 

The glovebox lids are closed by purely mechanical means. To close, it is sufficient to 
press only one of the lids closed. Opening is performed automatically and can be 
initiated by a button in the instrument panel. 

Closing Glovebox by Hand 

When one of the glovebox lids is pressed, the other lid is automatically closed in the 
process. The lids are mechanically interconnected by a kinematic assembly. Thus, one 
lid will always follow the movement of the other lid until the glovebox is fully closed and 
locked. 

The glovebox can be closed by hand. However, pressing the button is enough to open 
the glovebox.

Magnets are located in the top and bottom lids and in the locking hooks. Closing of the 
lids is assisted down to the last millimeters by the integrated magnets. 

When the glovebox lids come into the area of magnetic force, the magnets pull the lids 
into their end positions. The effect created by the magnets is also called the Soft Close 
effect. 

The arrangement of the magnets (north and south pole 2,3,5 and 6) and the pivoted 
suspension lock the locking hooks in their end position automatically without the 
assistance ofthe electrical unlocking mechanisms. 

In the "CLOSED" end position, the locking hooks snap into place and the glovebox is 
mechanically engaged. 

Note: If the glovebox has not been fully closed and locked, it opens automati¬ 
cally. The glovebox musttherefore be closed again so as to prevent an 
increased risk of injury caused by parts falling out in the event of an accident!

Monitoring of "CLOSED" End Position 

Monitoring of the end position of the gloveboxlids is necessary to ensure that the 
glovebox is fully closed and locked. 

The end position of the lids in the "CLOSED" direction is recorded indirectly with infrared 
sensors. There are two infrared sensors in each lock. These infrared sensors detect the 
"CLOSED" position ofthe locking hooks.

When the glovebox lids are closed, the locking hooks (4 and 5) are turned by magnetic 
force in the locking direction and engage. The slides (6 and 7) are displaced to the right 
by the rotational movement of the locking hooks. The movement is limited by the 
damper and at the same time noise is minimized at the stop. 

The mechanical interlock (3) is pressed upwards by the lower slide and locks the locking 
hooks. On the lowerslide (7) there is a "lug", which changes the status ofthe infrared 
sensors due to the movement ofthe lowerslide. 

The electronic circuit evaluates the change in status and detects whetherthe glovebox is 
fully closed.

Unlocking of the glovebox is an autarkic function. Unlocking of the glovebox can be 
triggered as from "Terminal 30g ON". 

When the button (1) is pressed, the junction box ECU (2) receives a low signal 
(approximately 0 V). The junction-box ECU now emits a pulse width modulated signal at 
the level of the vehicle system voltage. The unlocking mechanisms (3 and 4) of the 
glovebox receive this signal for approximately 100 ms. 

Each unlocking mechanism features an electronic circuit, which controls and monitors 
the unlocking and locking processes. 

Note: Unlocking requests are not executed when the glovebox is open. 

The glovebox unlocking mechanisms cannot be diagnosed by means of the diagnosis 
system. If an unlocking mechanism is defective, the only option is to replace it 
completely. 

The button for unlocking the glovebox can be diagnosed with a multimeter in accordance 
with the circuit diagram. 

Over/Under-Voltage 

The glovebox unlocking mechanisms can be activated within a voltage range of 9 V to 
16 V. Correct operation cannot be guaranteed outside this range.

Unlocking Sequence 

The unlocking-mechanism electronic circuit recognizes when the junction-box ECU 
transmits the signal for unlocking. The unlocking drive (11) is activated once 
synchronization has been completed.The unlocking drive rotates the drive shaft (9). 

The drive shaft moves the slide (7) in the "OPEN" direction. Initially the mechanical 
interlock is released by the slide. 

The upper slide (6) is displaced up to the stop on the damper (1), thereby turning the 
locking hooks (4 and 5) in the "OPEN" position. The glovebox is unlocked and 
automatically opened. The two lids are opened by spring force up to the mechanical end 
stop.

The two unlocking mechanisms must be synchronized in orderto achieve uniform 
unlocking. Both unlocking mechanisms are activated by the junction-box ECU. 

The unlocking mechanism which first receives the unlocking signal from the junction-box 
ECU starts the communication between the unlocking mechanisms. 

The unlocking mechanisms adapt their status and signal to each othertheir readiness for 
unlocking. The unlocking sequence is initiated when both unlocking mechanisms are 
ready.

Glovebox Light 

Opening/closing the glovebox activates or deactivates the glovebox light respectively. 
Activation follows the Soft ON function and deactivation follows the Soft OFF function. 
The function is derived from the interior lights and is contained in the unlocking- 
mechanism electronic circuit. 

The unlocking-mechanism electronic circuit evaluates the signal from the glovebox 
button. The glovebox light is switched on as soon as the signal from the junction-box 
ECU changes from low (approximately 0 V) to high (vehicle system voltage). 

The signal from the infrared sensors (position detection of the locking hooks in the 
"CLOSED" direction) is used forswitching off.

Emergency Unlocking of Glovebox 

An emergency unlocking mechanism is provided so that the glovebox can be opened 
when the vehicle is de-energized or in the event of faulty unlocking mechanisms. 

The emergency unlocking mechanism can be accessed from the front passenger's side. 
Only the instrument-panel cover needs to be opened here. Behind this cover is a loop, 
which, when pulled, unlocks and opens the glovebox. 

The color of the system components shown here has been changed so that the 
emergency unlocking mechanism can be recognized more easily. Glovebox can be 
opened even when the vehicle is de-energized!

Unlocking Mechanisms 

The glovebox has one unlocking mechanism each on the inside and the outside of the 
vehicle. The unlocking mechanisms are symmetrically designed (identical). 

The advantage of this lies in the fact only one type of hardware and software is needed 
for glovebox unlocking. 

The glovebox light is always connected to the unlocking mechanism inside the vehicle. 

Symmetrical Design 

The unlocking mechanisms contain among otherthings the following components: 

• Unlocking drive 

• Control electronics forthe unlocking drive and glovebox light 

• 2 infrared sensors (detection of glovebox "CLOSED") 

• M echanical interlock (ball) of locking hooks

The control electronics is located on a printed-circuit board on the back of the unlocking 
mechanism. The connection of the unlocking drive (11) and the infrared sensors (2) are 
also integrated on the printed-circuit board. 

The slide consists of two parts. The top part (6) is shown slightly transparent in the 
above graphic. This makes it easierto recognize the second part of the slide (7), which 
releases or locks the mechanical interlock (3). 

Each unlocking mechanism has two locking hooks (4 and 5). One (4) is forthe top lid, 
the other (5)forthe bottom lid. 

Triggered when the lug forthe emergency unlocking mechanism is pulled. The bowden 
cable (8) transmits the pulling action. The emergency unlocking mechanism (10) pulls 
the lower slide back and thereby releases the mechanical interlock (3). In this way, both 
slides can be moved in the "OPEN" direction and the locking hooks are unlocked.
