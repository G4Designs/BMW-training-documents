E70 Information and Communication Technology 


Introduction 


Information and Communication Technology (IKT) 

IKT comprises systems that inform or entertain the driver and other occupants. 

Depending on equipment configuration, the IKT also serves the purpose of making avail¬ 
able servicing-relevant data and sending messages in the case of emergency. 

This Product Information provides an overview of the IKT topics. The components avail¬ 
able at the time of the market launch are described with the help of the vehicle outline 
diagram and the bus overview. 

With the E70, a fiber optics-based bus is also used for data transmission in information 
and communication applications IKT in the BM W X5. 

The M OST (M edia Oriented System Transport) is already known from the following 
BMW vehicles: 

• BMW 7 Series (E65, E66) 

• BMW 6 Series (E63, E64) 

• BMW 5 Series (E60, E61) 

• BMW 3 Series (E90, E91, E92) 

Navigation Systems 

Map navigation (Professional navigation system) based on the Car Communication 
Computer (CCC) is provided in the E70.The functions correspond with the areas already 
known in the E60, E61, E63, E64, E90, E91 and E92. 

Via the voice input, the CCC supports the entry of whole words fora country, town and 
street. It is still also possible to spell the destination. 

Forthe market launch of the E70 in the USA, the (RTTI) traffic warning system (Real 
Time Traffic Information) is provided. The service is controlled by the "Traffic information 
fornavigation"option and is currently included in the range of functions of the 
"Professional navigation system" option. 

RTTI is transferred in the form of a data stream from particular FM stations. The data is 
received from the CCC FM tuner, evaluated and made available forthe navigation sys¬ 
tem. In the navigation map, traffic issues are indicated by symbols. The traffic issues are 
also available in a list. The list entries are then sorted by the current distance between 
the vehicle and the traffic issue. If the traffic issue is on the current route, there is a voice 
output.

Voice Activation Systems 

The High and Basic voice activation systems already familiar in the E60, E61, E63, E64, 
E90, E91 and E92 are available. The High voice activation system is used in the CCC. 

The Basic voice activation system allows operation of the telephone functions and is 
used in the Telematics Control Unit (TCU). 

Telephone Systems 

The following telephone systems will be available: 

• "Complete mobile phone station" option. 

• "Carphone station"option. 

"Telephone station" option comprises: 

• Wiring harness to connecttheTelematics Control UnitTCU, base plate, Bluetooth 
antenna, SOS antenna, SOS speaker, microphone and emergency call button with 
emergency call indicator lamp. 

• Roof aerial with telephone aerial.

Telecommunication Services 

The following well-known services from BMW ASSIST are available: 

• Emergency call 

- M anually using the emergency call button 

- Automatically by airbag triggering 

• Roadside assistance 

- Manually via the BMW ASSIST menu 

• Service request 

- Manually via the BMW ASSIST menu 

• BMW customer relations 

- Manually via the BMW ASSIST menu 

• Auto request 

- Automatic service request, triggered by the instrument cluster when 
CBS warning messages appear 

- Activated in the BMW ASSIST menu 

• Stolen Vehicle Recovery 

- Remote service, triggered on behalf of the customer by the ATX service provider. 

Note: All services named here are available without restriction for all equip¬ 
ment specifications. 

With the start of series production of the E 70, the following new services are also 
planned: 

• Remote Door Unlock 

- Unlocking of the vehicle, triggered on behalf of the customer by the ATX service 
provider. 

• Concierge service 

- Download of points of interest, such as filling stations, restaurants, hotels, etc. 
-The service is started by the customer in the BMW ASSIST menu. 

Note: Both services require the "Complete mobile phone station USA"option 
to be fitted. If the navigation system is fitted, the concierge service data 
can be accepted for destinations.

The legend above applies for the two preceding input/output diagrams. The first one 
shows the 'Professional' radio option, the second shows the 'Professional' with navigation 
system. 


Note: In the US version, CHAMP is fitted as the "Professional" radio and in the 
European version, the M-ASK. 

The difference between the two items of equipment lies in the activation of the GPS and 
wheel speed signals. With the 'Professional' radio, both signals are sentto the Telematics 
Control UnitTCU. With the navigation system, both signals are sentto the Car 
Communication ComputerCCC. 

Communication between the mobile phone and the Telematics Control Unit takes place 
via the Bluetooth interface.

Note: The legends apply forthe two previous system circuit diagrams. 

Thanks to the improved overview, the telephone systems with the stereo systems are 
shown. The HiFi system is standard equipment in the US version. For more information 
about these systems, see the "E70 audio systems" Product Information. 

Depending on the equipment, the TCU is supplied with powervia terminal 30g ortermi- 
nal 30g_f. A power supply via terminal 30g_f is necessary for provision of the BMW 
ASSIST services: 

• Remote Door Unlock Opening the vehicle doors for servicing 

• Stolen Vehicle Recovery 

The implementation of the Remote Door Unlock service is carried out via the (MOST) 
WUP signal. The signal is used to wake up the vehicle. The (TCU) reacts to a call from the 
provider, performed in the customer order. The (TCU) sends a signal via the (MOST) 

WUP line to the Car Access System (CAS3). The (CAS3)then wakes up the vehicle. 

The CHAM P receives the terminal 58g (lighting) signal via fixed wiring.The CCC receives 
this signal via the K-CAN. 

The eject button on the base board does not receive a signal from terminal 58g.The but¬ 
ton is not illuminated.
