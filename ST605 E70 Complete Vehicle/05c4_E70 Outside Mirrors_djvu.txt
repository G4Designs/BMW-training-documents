The instrument cluster (1) registers the outside temperature and makes it available to the 
junction box control unit (4), outside mirror Low (basis version). 


The junction box control unit powers the outside mirror heating system. The outside mir¬ 
rors (5 +6) can be adjusted with the mirror adjustment switch in the driver's door switch 
cluster (6). 

Note: In the High version of the outside mirrors, the footwell module (2) 

receives the outside temperature from the instrument cluster. The out¬ 
side mirrors are connected via the LIN-bus. The footwell therefore 
requests the mirror heating function via the LIN-bus.

The instrument cluster (16) receives the value corresponding to the outside temperature 
from the outside temperature sensor (1) and makes it available via the K-CAN.The 
footwell module (15) evaluates the K-CAN signal and initiates activation of the outside 
mirror heating (3 and 13). 

The mirror adjustment motors (7 and 9) are driven by the electronic mirror module. The 
electronic mirror module receives the request to adjust the outside mirrors via the LIN- 
bus. 

The outside mirrors are connected via the LIN-bus. All information such as the memory 
position or mirrorfunctions, e.g. dip outside mirrors, is transferred via the LIN-bus. 

Note: The footwell module is the central control unitforthe outside mirror 
functions. The outside mirrors with memory function, photochromatic 
function and the fold-in function are connected with the LIN-bus.

Functions 


The following outside mirrorfunctions are possible depending on the vehicle equipment: 

• M irror adjustment in up/down and left/right directions. 

• M irror heating. 

• M irror fold-in. 

• Photochromatic mirror, outside mirror with memory function. 

• Automatic parking function. 

• M anual adjustment. 

• M otor protection by repeat interlock. 

Mirror Adjustment 

Outside Mirror Adjustment (Standard) 

The mirrors can be moved up or down as well as left or right when the mirror adjustment 
switch is operated. The mirror adjustment switch activates the adjustment motors directly. 

The mirror selector switch in the driver's door switch cluster is used to select between 
the outside mirror adjustmentforthe driver's door and passenger's door. 

The actuator drive unit comes up against a slip clutch when the outside mirror reaches 
the end stop. This clutch protects the components of the outside mirrorfrom mechani¬ 
cal damage. 

Outside Mirror Adjustment (Photochromatic) 

The driver's door switch cluster is connected via the LIN-bus to the footwell module. 

The footwell module checks the status of the mirror adjustment switch every 20 ms. The 
electronics in the driver's door switch cluster evaluates the mirror adjustment switch and 
sends the signal via the LIN-bus to the footwell module. In turn, the footwell module initi¬ 
ates activation of the adjustment motors. 

To protect the mirror drive unit, the mirror adjustment is limited to a maximum activation 
time of 10 s. Activation is maintained within this period of 10 s until the mirror adjust¬ 
ment switch is released. 

Activation is also maintained until the outside mirror blocks or reaches its end position. 

Detecting Position of Outside Mirrors 

The Photochromatic outside mirrors have two potentiometers that register the mirror 
adjustment. The potentiometers receive their 5 V voltage supply from the electronic mir¬ 
ror module. The determined values of the potentiometers are stored in the footwell mod¬ 
ule forthe memory function. 


11 

E70 Outside Mirrors 





Mirror Heating 

The mirror heating is operable as from terminal 15 ON. 

On the standard varientthe mirror heating is activated by the junction box control unit. 

On the Photochromatic mirrorthe mirror heating is activated by the footwell module. The 
corresponding information is passed on to the electronic mirror module via the LIN-bus. 

• The instrument cluster makes available the outside temperature value via the K- 
CAN. 

• The junction box control unit provides the information forthe wipers via the K-CAN. 

• The percentage switch-on time is calculated from both values in the footwell 
module. 

The following table shows the values forthe percentage ON time.

The percentage increase is still retained for 300 s afterthe wiper is switched off. The 
maximum electric heating output is 28 W that is set by means of voltage and current 
measurement in the mirror. 

Low Voltage 

The electronic mirror module switches off the mirror heating in the event of a low voltage 
condition. 

• This has a positive effect on the charge balance of the battery. The cutout threshold 
is at 10.8V. 

• The electronic mirror module switches on the mirror heating again as from a voltage 
of 11.6V. 

Terminal 50 

During the start procedure, the starter outputs the "terminal 50 ON" status and the mirror 
heating is switched off during this period of time. 


12 

E70 Outside Mirrors 





Auxiliary Heater 

The mirror heating is switched on despite "terminal 15 OFF" in connection with the auxil¬ 
iaryheating (independent heating) system, the information for the mirror heating is provid¬ 
ed via the K-CAN.The outside mirror heating is limited to 300 s when the auxiliary heat¬ 
ing system is active. 

Mirror Fold-in 

The mirrorfold-in function is controlled by the footwell module. Forthis purpose, the 
footwell module requests the status of the mirrorfold in switch. The driver's switch clus¬ 
ter evaluates the mirrorfold-in switch and forwards the request via the LIN-bus.The 
footwell module initiates the fold-in function. 

The electronic mirror module receives the request and executes this function by activat¬ 
ing the corresponding fold-in motor. The footwell module receives the request via the 
LIN-bus. Both outside mirrors are folded in towards the vehicle thus reducing the vehicle 
width. 

Photochromatic Outside Mirrors 

The automatic dip function (auto dimming) of the outside mirrors is dependent on the 
setting of the interior rear-view mirror. The function is available as from "terminal 15 ON". 

The interior rear-view mirror sends the request to dip the mirrors directly to the roof func¬ 
tions center. In turn, the roof functions center makes the request available on the K-CAN. 

The footwell module sends this request via the LIN-bus to the electronics in the outside 
mirrors. 

Outside Mirrorwith Memory Function 

The outside mirror High features a memory function that is stored in the footwell module. 
Three memory locations are available forthis purpose:They are: 

• Current position when leaving the vehicle 

• Memory position of memory button 1 

• Memory position of memory button 2 

Remote Control 

Up to three personalizable remote controls are possible per vehicle. 

When the vehicle is locked using the remote control, the current mirror position is stored 
in the memory location for the key memory of the remote control currently used. 

As a result, the mirror position last set, referred to the remote control used, is always 
reassumed when the vehicle is unlocked. 


13 

E70 Outside Mirrors 



Storing Memory Position 

The position of the outside mirrors is stored in the footwell module by pressing the "M" 
button followed by pressing one of the memory buttons within 7s. The driver's seat mod¬ 
ule evaluates the memory buttons and sends this information via the K-CAN. 

Calling Up Memory Position 

When the memory button is pressed, the driver's seat module receives the request to 
adjust the outside mirrors to the memory position. The driver's seat module sends this 
request on the K-CAN. The footwell module evaluates the request and activates the 
memory position. 

Automatic Parking Function 

The outside mirror on the front passenger's side is swivelled downward when reverse 
gear is engaged so that the curb can be easily viewed. 

The automatic parking function is activated underfollowing conditions: 

• Terminal 15 ON and 

• Reverse gear signal and 

• Mirror selector switch set to driver position. 

Note: The footwell module receives the reverse gearsignal via the K-CAN. The 
automatic transmission control unit then makes this signal available. 

Folding Mirror Manually 

The outside mirrors can be folded in or out manually. The mirrors could loose their set 
position when folded in or out manually. It may be therefore necessary to fold them out 
and fold them in and then back out again to reset them.
