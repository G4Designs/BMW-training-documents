E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 


Introduction 


Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 

By applying today's standard consideration aspects, subdividing the functions of driving 
dynamics systems into the three co-ordinate axes results in the use of three different 
systems that belong to longitudinal dynamics on the E70. 

Longitudinal dynamics systems (effective direction mainly on the x-axis or longitudinal 
axis): 

• (ABS) Anti-lock braking system 

• (DSC ) Dynamic stability control 

• (EMF) Electromechanical parking brake 

• (DCC) Dynamic cruise control (cruise control with brake intervention) 

ABS in DSC 

The ABS prevents the wheels locking while braking and therefore ensures that the vehi¬ 
cle stays on track and can be steered in critical situations. 

ABS is constantly activated during vehicle operation and cannot be switched off by the 
driver. The four wheel speed sensors send data to the DSC control unit that monitors the 
speed of each wheel. If one or several wheels decelerate at a faster rate than permitted, 
the DSC control unit activates the hydraulic unit, which in turn reduces the hydraulic 
pressure in the corresponding brake line. The DSC control unit and the hydraulic unit 
make up one assembly. 

When the DSC control unit requests intervention of the antilock braking system, it acti¬ 
vates the inlet and outlet solenoid valves in the hydraulic unit of the affected brake line 
and switches on the return pump. The inlet valve closes in orderto disconnect the brake 
line(s) from the master brake cylinder and the outlet valve opens to allow the brake fluid 
of the affected brake circuit to escape into the reservoir in orderto reduce the pressure in 
the circuit. Consequently, the braking effect is reduced and the wheel begins to turn. 

The DSC control unit then opens and closes the inlet and outlet valves in such a way as 
to ensure the optimum braking pressure is built up at each wheel without the wheels 
locking. The return pump conveys brake fluid from the equalizing reservoir of the master 
brake cylinder, thus maintaining a constant brake fluid pressure downstream of the inlet 
valves so that the pressure in the brake lines is immediately re-established when the inlet 
valves are open again. 

In the case of braking with ABS assistance, the driver normally obtains feedback in the 
form of pedal vibration and the noise of solenoid valves orthe pump. This is reduced to a 
minimum by the high-performance hydraulic unit of the DSC E7x in the E70.

Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

The E70 is equipped with a new generation of the dynamic stability control system. 

Note: To date, the DSC driving dynamics system on all-wheel drive vehicles 
was referred to with the abbreviation 11 DXC". 

Since this lead to confusion with the xDrive, in the future the dynamic stability control sys¬ 
tem will be known as DSC also on all-wheel drive vehicles. 

This new generation of the dynamic stability control (DSC E7x, supplied by Bosch) in the 
B M W X5 is actually the only driving dynamics system that covers all three areas of longi¬ 
tudinal, transverse and vertical dynamics with its control intervention functions and its 
modularfunctional structure. 

With its varied control strategies, the DSC ensures outstanding driving stability within 
physical limits, active safety and excellent traction in all driving situations. 

Electromechanical Parking Brake (EMF) 

The electromechanical parking brake was used forthe first time at BMW on the E65 (7 
Series). 

In principle, the task of the parking brake is to secure the stationary vehicle to prevent it 
rolling away. The parking brake firmly holds the parked vehicle. In contrast to the parking 
brake that to date was based on a pure mechanical hand brake and foot brake system, 
the EMF is designed as an automated, comfort-oriented parking brake system where the 
driver can apply and release the parking brake by the push of a button. 

The design layout of the parking brake system is in keeping with typical BMW require¬ 
ments: 

• Exclusion of all safety-critical situations 

• Optimum functionality 

• Maximum system availability 

• High degree of comfort and convenience 

Besides complying with the legal requirement of mechanically holding the parked vehicle 
and providing an independently operable parking brake in addition to the service brake, 
one of the main advantages of the EMF is that it enables dynamic braking with DSC con¬ 
trol. 

Dynamic C ruise C ontrol (DC C) 

The dynamic cruise control is a conventional cruise control system (Tempomat) which 
features additional functions including active brake intervention. Cruise control with brake 
intervention (DCC) was introduced forthe first time at BMW on the E90 (3 Series).

New Features of the DSC E7x 

The system supplierforthe DSC E7x is Bosch. With its optimized control functions, the 
new system design makes a significant contribution to increased driving dynamics. 
Additional functions for active safety and additional comfort have been implemented in 
the new system.The new system in the E70 offers the following advantages: 

• Driving Dynamics 

- DSC mode: Increased driving dynamics and maximum traction. Thanks to more 
precise and faster control interventions, the driver can further extend the bound¬ 
aries of driving dynamics while retaining vehicle safety. 

- DTC mode: Compared to DSC mode, Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) allows for 
increased slip at the drive wheels to provide maximum propulsion when driving off 
in snow for instance. In addition, the stabilizing control interventions cut in later in 
DTC mode thus allowing a more sport-oriented driving profile. 

• Active Safety 

- The additional functions of brake standby, dry braking and fading assistance short¬ 
en the stopping distances. 

- Increased DSC efficiency makes for more effective safety-relevant functions. 

• Comfort 

- Improved operating comfort (brake interventions are less audible, pedal vibration is 
drastically reduced) through the use of a 6-piston pump in connection with a new 
higher-frequency electrical actuation system. 

- Additional functions such as start-off assistant and parking brake provide increased 
driver assistance and comfort. 


12 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Classic Brake Control Functions 

• Antilock Braking System (ABS) 

ABS prevents individual wheels from locking while braking by targeted modulation of 
the braking pressures. The steerability of the vehicle through the front wheels is 
largely retained. When braking on road surfaces with different coefficients of friction, 
the straight-ahead position is stabilized in co-operation with the active steering 
(option). 

• Cornering Brake Control (CBC) 

(CBC) keeps the vehicle under control when braking lightly in fast corners by asym¬ 
metric control of the braking pressure, thus improving the cornering stability. 

• Automatic Stability Control (ASC) 

(ASC) prevents spinning ofthe drive wheels by way of specific brake application and 
influencing the drive torque delivered by the combustion engine thus optimizing the 
forward propulsion ofthe vehicle. 

• Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) 

If an emergency braking operation is initiated by the driver, the system assists the 
driver by automatically applying the maximum braking pressure immediately in order 
to optimize the braking effect. 

• Automatic Differential Brake (ADB-X) 

ADB-X replicates the function ofthe differential locks: if a wheel tends towards spin¬ 
ning, it is automatically braked so that forward propulsion can still be achieved 
through the other wheel on the axle. 

• Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

A vehicle which tends to understeer or oversteer is stabilized by specific brake inter¬ 
vention on individual wheels.This function operates on the E70 togetherwith the 
active steering (option). 

• Hill Descent Control (HDC) 

HDC automatically applies the brakes at individual wheels when driving downhill at 
low speed, particularly on poor surfaces such as sand, gravel or snow. The function 
is activated by means of a button in the center console. 

• Trailer Stabilization Logic 

This function automatically detects when a vehicle with a trailer begins to sway and it 
stabilizes the vehicle-trailer combination by specific brake intervention thus reducing 
the speed to below the critical shear/swerve level. 


13 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Additional Brake Control Functions 

• Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) 

DTC represents a special mode of DSC which, while interacting with (ASC), (ADB-X) 
and xDrive, realizes maximum propulsion on loose surfaces such as snow, sand or 
gravel, by extending the slip thresholds. The stabilization interventions in connection 
with DTC cut in laterthan with DSC thus enabling a more sport-oriented driving pro¬ 
file. 

• Brake Standby 

This function builds up a moderate braking pressure in the system when the driver 
very quickly takes his/herfoot off the accelerator pedal. The braking effect then cuts 
infasterto assist the driver in emergency braking. 

• Dry Braking 

This function lightly applies the brake pads at specific intervals depending on the 
operation of the windscreen wiper in orderto dry the brake discs.This distinctly 
improves the braking effect in braking operations. 

• Fading Assistance 

This function assists the driver in applying the braking force when the brake temper¬ 
ature is very high due to an extreme driving profile which requires a higher braking 
force in orderto achieve the required braking effect. 

• Start-off Assistant 

The start-off assistant holds the vehicle on gradients for about. 1.5 seconds after 
the driver has taken his/her foot from the brake. In this way, the driver can conve¬ 
niently operate the accelerator pedal without the vehicle rolling back. 

• Electromechanical Parking Brake (EMF) 

The EMF is a parking brake that can be applied and released by means of a bidirec¬ 
tional button. Depending on the respective vehicle operating situation, the holding 
force is applied wither hydraulically via the DSC or mechanically via EMF.

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 











Basic Functions ofthe EMF 


The parking brake (EMF) has two different functions, depending on the operating status 
ofthe vehicle. 

• Parking brake mode 

- When the engine is running orthe vehicle is rolling, the parking brake acts on the 
service brake with the aid ofthe DSC hydraulics. This means the brake units on the 
front and rear axle are active. 

- If the engine is not running and the vehicle is stationary, the electromechanical 
actuator and its cable assembly ensure the parking brake acts on the duo-servo 
drum brake on the rear axle. In this case, the vehicle is braked as defined in the con¬ 
trol unit. 


• Dynamic braking 

Defined retardation is triggered via the DSC system if the parking brake button is 
pulled up while driving.The retardation or deceleration is monitored bythe DSC 
control functions and takes place for as long as the parking brake button is pulled 


Emergency Release 

A mechanical emergency release facility is provided in orderto be able to release the 
parking brake in the event ofthe electromechanical actuating unit failing or insufficient 
power supply. 


CAUTION!!! 


Secure vehicle to prevent it rolling before operating 
the emergency release! 


The release procedure is performed manually with the emergency release cable assem¬ 
bly and the emergency release handle from the vehicle tool kit. The emergency release 
procedure releases the duo-servo drum brake by way of mechanical intervention in the 
actuator of the electromechanical control unit. 


Note: After a powerfailure, it may still not be possible to move the vehicle even 
after releasing the brake with the emergency release facility. The park¬ 
ing lock ofthe automatic gearbox may still be engaged (see Product 
Information Automatic Gearbox E70). 

0 nee released, using the emergency release facility, the parking brake cannot be reacti¬ 
vated manually. The function can be restored only byway of electrical activation. 

Restoring Operation After Emergency Release 

Afterturning on the ignition, push down the EM F operating button and pull up again to 
activate the parking brake. 


16 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 




Service Functions 


After replacing the brake shoes of the duo servo drum brake as part of repair or mainte¬ 
nance procedures, the new brake shoes must be bedded-in to ensure adequate holding 
effect of the new brake shoes. The software of the EMF control unit features a "bedding- 
in" service mode that must be activated in this case with the BMW diagnostic system. 

Indicator/warning lamps in the instrument cluster signal the operating status as well as 
system fault situations. In the event of faulty signals, the system causing the problem 
enters corresponding fault codes in the control unit and the system is partially or totally 
shutdown corresponding to the situation. The driver receives additional information on 
any restricted functions in the control display. 

Note: It is only possible to coastorpush the vehicle with the transmission in 
position N. Neutral usually remains selected fora maximum of 30 min¬ 
utes. If the vehicle is stationary for longer, the automatic transmission 
parking lock will automatically be engaged. 

Example Scenarios 

Basic function of the parking brake controlled by the actuating unit Scenario: "Ignition 
ON", the engine is not yet running and the foot brake is pressed. 

With the vehicle stationary, the parking brake is released or applied by pulling or pressing 
the EMF button. The indicator lamp in the instrument cluster either goes out or lights up 
red. 

Note: The parking brake can be released only with the foot brake pressed when 
the engine is running orturned off. 

The dynamic braking function is triggered if the EMF operating button is pulled while the 
vehicle is rolling. 

Transition from EMF Actuating Unit to DSC 

The system switches overfrom mechanical to hydraulic mode when the engine is start¬ 
ed. If the EMF actuating unit was applied at the time, the DSC hydraulics will assume 
control of the braking force. The EMF actuating unit is not released until the hydraulics 
are holding the vehicle secure. The indicator lamp remains lit red throughout this process, 
and the driver is unaware of the transition (the lamp does not even flash). 


17 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Transition from DSC to EMF Actuating Unit 

The transition to the EM F actuating unit always takes place on exiting the hydraulic func¬ 
tion at "ignition OFF". If the parking brake was applied, the hydraulics are not released 
until the EMF actuating unit is applied.The indicatorlamp remains red throughout this 
transition. 

Function ofthe Parking Brake Controlled by the DSC Hydraulics 

Scenario: "Engine running" 

The parking brake is applied or released completely by hydraulic means when the EM F 
operating button is pulled or pressed. 

Dynamic braking ( hydraulic) is triggered with the vehicle rolling and the button operated 
atv>3 km/h. The basic functions mainly correspond to the functional scope of a conven¬ 
tional mechanical parking brake. 

The system switches between "brake applied" and "brake released" with pressure build¬ 
up and pressure reduction every time the EMF button is pulled or pressed. 

The parking brake must be released by pressing the EM F button before starting off. 
Pulling away against the applied brake pressure results in an increase in pressure and a 
warning to the driver. 

Scenario: "At rest" 

Remove control removed The parking brake enters rest status when the remote control is 
removed. If the parking brake is applied, the time-delayed red indicatorlamp signals this 
status to the driver. 

If the EM F actuating unit is released in rest mode, the EM F actuating unit is applied 
when the EM F button is pulled with the vehicle stationary. If the vehicle is in motion, 
pressing the button will initiate dynamic braking. 

Note: Always take the remote control with you when leaving the vehicle 
otherwise children could release the parking brake. 

Dynamic Braking 

Two braking units for brake operation are required by law (previously: foot brake and hand 
brake) In the E70, the second operating point besides the foot brake is the EM F button 
on the gear selector lever. 

The vehicle is braked by the drum brakes at the rear axle if the EMF button is pressed 
and held at speeds below v = 3 km/h and with the engine switched off. 

The vehicle is braked at a rate of 3 m/s2 for 0.8 seconds if the EMF button is pressed 
when the vehicle is in motion. Braking power is then ramped up to 5 m/s2 forthe next 2 
seconds. This braking action is retained for as long as the EMF button is pulled. 


18 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



For stability reasons (over-braking - rear axle) the dynamic braking function is also trig¬ 
gered in the rest state in response to the vehicle rolling (engine turned off, ignition OFF) 
by means of active pressure build-up by the DSC hydraulics together with the DSC func¬ 
tion. The brake pressure required is made available as rapidly as possible. 

The braking action is always monitored by the DSC control function. This ensures vehicle 
stability while braking. Since all four wheels are braked hydraulically, there is considerably 
greater deceleration with a minimum of operating effort (EM F button) by comparison with 
conventional parking brakes.The controlled brakes are therefore able to contribute to 
improving vehicle safety. 

Fortraffic safety reasons, operation of dynamic braking is indicated to the road users 
behind by the brake lights coming on. 

To avoid accidental operation and misuse, the driver is notified of dynamic braking opera¬ 
tion by a display message and gong. 

This function is intended only for use in an emergency and must never be used as a sub¬ 
stitute for normal operation of the service brake. 

The more effective braking solution is used if the parking brake deceleration request is 
overlapped by the brake pedal being depressed. The DSC control unit decides which 
deceleration request is to be carried out. 

Exiting Dynamic Emergency Braking 

The vehicle will remain hydraulically braked even afterthe EMF button has been released 
if the vehicle is braked to a halt by dynamic braking. There is a transition to the normal 
DSC hydraulics function.The hydraulic brake is only released when the EMF button is 
pressed once more. 

If the EMF button is pressed while the vehicle is still in motion, the system level prevailing 
before the emergency dynamic braking was activated is resumed. If the parking brake is 
released and the vehicle is coasting, it is possible to activate emergency dynamic braking 
in any situation (terminal 30,15, R) by pressing the EM F button. 


19 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Error Messages 

All fault statuses are detected by the monitoring system and displayed to the driver. The 
main aim is to avoid safety-critical conditions for vehicle occupants, the vehicle and its 
surroundings. 

A fault can be assigned different priorities depending on the driving situation (vehicle sta¬ 
tionary/in motion, starting/stopping) and the system availability. In addition to the indicator 
lamp, supplementary instructions may be shown in the control display. 

To avoid additional damage, faults in the parking brake mechanism, particularly a broken 
cable in the operating cable assembly and excess load are detected by the force sensor 
and indicated accordingly. See shutdown strategy table. 

Error messages can no longer be output actively in the event of the EMF control unit fail¬ 
ing. In this case, the instrument cluster assumes the control of the correct error message 
on recognizing the absence of the regular EM F telegram via the PT-CAN (alive signal).

General Parking Brake Fault Concept 

Fault Distribution Between DSC and EMF Control Unit 

Only DSC faults that actually affect operation of the parking brake result in shut-down of 
the hydraulic function. These are mainly faults that result in shut-down oftheABS func- 
tionality.T hey trigger the transition to manual emergency mode. Dynamic braking is no 
longer possible unless only CAN faults occur affecting this functionality. 


20 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 


























• Shut-down level "electromechanical mode" 

(only EM F actuating unit) initiated by following DSC faults 

- DSC control unit fault 

- Electrical fault (e.g. wiring harness) 

- Sensorfault (brake light switch/wheel speed) 

- actuator fault/hydraulic unit 

- Bus communication fault 

• Shut-down level "electrohydraulic mode" 

(failure of EMF actuating unit) 

- Force sensorfault 

- Actuator fault of EM F actuating unit 

- Error in actuation electronics 

- Fault in actuating mechanism 

- Electrical fault 

• Shut-down level "total shut-down" 

- EMF control unit or controller fault 
-EMF button fault 

- Electrical fault, power supply 

Note: All fault codes are stored in the control unitin which the monitoring rou¬ 
tine was performed. The EMF control unit is informed of the fault status 
of the DSC control unit and vice versa. 

Fault Regeneration 

When a fault is detected, the system remains in a safe mode until the end of the 
"ignition ON" cycle, once reached, a shut-down level is not cancelled during the cycle. 


21 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



A shut-down status can only be cancelled when a corresponding check beforehand 
guarantees that the component previously detected as faulty is functioning correctly. 
Forthis reason, such component tests are also performed in shut-down mode.The fault 
information is retained in the fault code memory. The shut-down status is then cancelled 
when a new "ignition ON" cycle is started. 

If correct operation of the component cannot be determined after a fault, the parking 
brake will remain in the secure, shut-down state until the next workshop visit where the 
fault code can be deleted by the diagnostic unit after a repair. 

Monitoring and Fault Detection 

• Monitoring of electrical faults: 

Breaks (open circuits) and short-circuits with respect to ground and U-battof all 
cables leading to the control unit as well as short-circuits in the actuator or its cables 
are detected and dealt with accordingly. If possible, this also applies to short-circuits 
of neighboring connector pins. 

External breaks or short-circuits do not result in irreparable damage to the control unit. 

• Monitoring input signals: 

All input variables of the parking brake are monitored. In the event of a fault occur¬ 
ring, the complete system is shut down with a corresponding error message and 
fault code entry. 

• Monitoring EMF button: 

The EMF button has a redundant layout for diagnosis. The signal levels of this com¬ 
ponent are permanently monitored. In the event of a plausibility error, the complete 
system is shut down with a corresponding fault code entry. 

The DSC control unit also checks the plausibility of the signals from the EM F button. 
Signal level errors result in a corresponding fault code entry with partial shut-down. 
Dynamic braking is now no longer possible. 

• Monitoring vehicle speed signals: 

The parking brake system is totally shut down only when all 3 speed inputs have 
failed or are not available 

- The direct digital wheel speed signal, also known as the discrete speed signal, is 
permanently checked in terms of plausible signal edge change. 

- A mutual plausibility check of the reference speed made available from the DSC 
via the PT-CAN and the discrete speed signal is constantly performed. 

- The reference speed is the mean wheel speed from the DSC which is compared 
with the transmission output speed sent by the EGS.

Hydraulic unit with DSC control unit 


With its new pump concept, the hydraulic unit provides a significant improvement in 
control accuracy. 2x3 pump elements with a diameter of 6.5mm and intake-optimized 
units operate in the hydraulic unit. This pump concept ensures substantially improved 
pressure dynamics resulting in lower pedal feedback in ABS mode and higher control 
quality in HDS. 

Forthe driverthis is noticeable in as far as the pedal pulsation can now only be felt very 
slightly during ABS braking. There is a pressure sensor in the hydraulic unit. 


DSC Control Unit 

The DSC control unit can be replaced individually. The 47-pin connector connects the 
DSC control unit to the engine wiring harness.

Main Features of the Active Wheel Speed Sensor 

• Location recognition: 

Indicates whetherthe change in magnetic field strength can be guaranteed for cor¬ 
rect operation with a high degree of certainty. This signal is no longer required after 
approximately 20 km/h /12 mph. 

• Stationary recognition: 

The power supply is switched on if the wheel is stationary for more than 1 second. 
A signal is sent to the DSC control unit every 740ms so that the availability of the 
sensorcan be checked. 

• Speed signal: 

This is a frequency-dependent signal for determining the speed of the wheel. 

• Direction of rotation recognition: 

Indicates the direction of rotation, clockwise / counterclockwise. 

• Air gap reserve: 

Indicates whetherthe change in magnetic field strength is below the 
necessary value for correct operation.

A two-wire line is used to transferthe signal .This two-wire interface is a combined earth 
and data line. 

The permanent magnet in the wheel speed sensor generates a magnetic field. The lines 
of the magnetic field run perpendicularto the sensor layer on the sensor element. 

The deviation of the fields lines caused by the increment wheel produces changes in 
resistance in the thin ferromagnetic layer of the sensor element.

SZL Electronics 

The SZL electronics consists of a processor, the power supply and following interfaces: 

• F-CAN 

• Optical switches 

• Electrical switches 

The optical sensorfor measuring the steering angle is integrated in the pc-board of the 
control unit. 

Steering Angle Sensor 

The steering angle sensor is designed as a contactless, optical angle measuring system. 
The system consists of a code disc and an optical sensor. The code disc is connected by 
means of a driverto the steering wheel. The code disc turns within the optical sensor as 
the steering wheel is turned. 

Code Disc 

The code disc is black and features a 
line pattern.This pattern consists of 
two continuous lines on the outside 
and inside ofthe code disc. 

There are broken lines located at 
defined intervals between the two 
continuous lines.These lines repre¬ 
sent the digital area ofthe sensor. 

The digital code changes every 2°. 

The oblique lines in the outer zone 
representthe analogue area ofthe 
sensor. These lines permit precise 
measurement (0.1°) ofthe steering 
angle.

The EM F actuating unit is sealed watertight and the housing cannot be opened. 
The EM F actuating unit contains the following main components: 


• EM F control unit 

• Electric motor 

• Spindle gear mechanism 

• Force sensor 

The force sensor in the EM F actuating unit is a very important componentfor operation 
of the parking brake. With its signals, the force sensor makes it possible forthe EM F con¬ 
trol unit to determine the actuating force. The actuating force is essential for securing the 
required braking pressure.

Lowersection of housing 


The housing ofthe force sensor consists of two halves.The lowersection of the housing 
(8) is made from pressure diecast aluminum so that it can take up the exerted forces. 

The upper section ofthe housing is made of plastic, to which the force sensor pc-board 
(5) with the Hall-IC (3) is secured. 

The magnet (4) is fixed to the piston (6). The force sensor is located between the left and 
right bowden cable assembly. During actuation, the piston (6) moves with the magnet 
against the spring (7). 

The travel range of spring compression is measured in accordance with the familiar Hall 
principle. Since the spring data are defined, the EM F control unit can calculate the 
applied force from the travel range and the spring data. The force sensor is calibrated at 
the end ofthe assembly line.

Cruise Control with Brake Intervention (DCC) 


The operating and display philosophy on the DCC steering column stalk and in the 
instrument cluster in the E70 is the same as that in other model series. 


Functionally, the cruise control with 
brake intervention DCC is integrated 
in the DSC control unit. The DCC 
functionality is realized by way of 
communication with the partner con¬ 
trol units of the DSC control unit in 
the system network such as 
DM E/DDE, EGS, SZL and instrument 
cluster. 


Index 

Explanation 

1 

Button, select stored speed 




The DCC function can be activated from 30 km/h/19 mph (up to max. 250km/h/155mph) 
and is deactivated by similar factors as for cruise control: 


• Brake pedal actuation 

• Deactivation of DSC 

• Activation of DTC 

• Active DSC intervention 

• Deactivation by the driver 

• Speed is reduced below 22 km/h 

• "N" engaged 

• EM F function activated 


DCC achieves a deceleration of max. 2.1 m/s 2 and an acceleration of about. 1.7 m/s 2 . 

The transverse acceleration is variably limited by the Curve Speed Limiter (CLS).The 
primary emphasis has been placed on comfortable performance in this system configu¬ 
ration. When cruise control with brake intervention is activated, the brake lights are also 
activated in accordance with legal requirements in connection with a system related 
braking operation DCC. 


40 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 










Extended functions of the DCC compared to a conventional cruise control system: 

• Active brake intervention to realize the set speed also when driving downhill 

• Curve Speed Limiter (CLS) - adaptation of driving speed when cornering (transverse 
acceleration). 

This function limits the maximum transverse acceleration dependent on vehicle 
speed with the aim of achieving the greatest possible agility in DCC mode. Driving 
on winding country roads in a speed range from > 50 km/h/31mph to < 120 
km/h/74mph is controlled with a value of 3.3 - 3.7 m/s 2 .The value can increase up to 
4.5 m/s forfast highway bends and slow lane changes at speeds between < 50 
km/h/31mph and >120 km/h/74mph. 

• Comfort Dynamic System (CDS) - this enables a type of "manual throttle mode" on 
the steering column stalk. 

• Adapted downhill mode - the overrun fuel cutout and gear down shift are corre¬ 
spondingly adapted.

Service Information 


Adjusting the Brake Shoes 

The procedure for adjusting the parking brake shoes is the same as before: 

Turn the adjusting screw using a screwdriverthrough the threaded hole in the wheel hub 

(10 teeth). 

Removing the Bowden Cable Assemblies 

Note: TheEMF must be set to service mode with the diagnostic tester before 
performing any maintenance orservice procedures (the parking brake 
cannot be applied, EMF assumes the outermost position). The EMF will 
not respond to an operating signal until service mode has been deacti¬ 
vated again. 

Necessary preparation: 

• To remove emergency release bowden cable assembly in luggage compartment 
(see Emergency Release). Use pointed pliers to press togetherthe white clip while 
pressing in the direction of the floor plate. 

Remove the wheels, brake calipers and brake discs (according to repair instructions) 
to expose the duo-servo brake shoes. 

The heat shield must be removed on vehicles with Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) 
and the ARS anti-roll bar lowered. (It is sufficient to release the ARS anti-roll bar at 
the mounting points and to lower it.) 

Unplug the electrical connectorfrom the EMF actuating unit. 

• To detach and expose the emergency release bowden cable assembly (Note: Clip 
fastening behind wheel arch panel). Release spring clip on wheel carrier. Detach 
nipple of cable assembly from brake show expander and pull the cable out of the 
wheel carrier. Release the cable assembly from the clip on the rear axle carrier and 
pull in the direction of the EMF actuating unit. 

• Detach the carrierforthe EMF actuating unitfrom the rear axle carrier and from the 
EMF actuating unit and pull out. 

• Screw the union nut on the rear left wheel cable assembly by 5-7 turns (left-hand 
thread) into the spline shaft of the actuator.Then fit the twist lock (square) of the 
threaded spindle in the guide in the actuator housing. The sleeve of the cable 
assembly must lie flat on the actuator housing before fitting the union nut. Tighten 
the union nut to 6 Nm. Attach the rear right wheel cable assembly to the mounting 
point on the actuator and secure with the clip. Make sure that the cable is firmly fit¬ 
ted. The cable assembly must lie flat on the actuator housing before fitting the 
union nut.Tighten to 6 Nm. 


42 

E70 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 




• Reinstallation takes place in the reverse order of removal. Fit the new EMF actuating 
unit, cable assemblies first, in the package space. If it was necessary to slack off the 
carrierfrom the EM F actuating unit, it must be resecured to the EM F actuating unit 
and tightened to a torque of 4 ±0.5 Nm.The component carrier must be secured to 
the rear axle carrierto a torque of 19Nm±15 %. Before securing the cable assem¬ 
blies to the wheel carrier (tightening torque 8 Nm), check that the brake cables are 
securely attached in the brake shoe expander otherwise the EM F actuating unit may 
be damaged as soon as it is operated. 

Start-up 

A new EMF actuating unit is always setto "service mode".This mode can be actively 
reset with the diagnostic tester or it resets itself automatically on exceeding a defined 
vehicle speed. The actuating unit is now in "standby mode".The EM F actuating unit 
must then be encoded to the vehicle. 

Initializing the Parking Brake 

Note: The EMF must be initialized with the diagnostic tester after replacing 
the drum brake linings. 

Bedding in the Duo-servo Brake 

If the brake shoes of the duo-servo brake are replaced as part of repair or maintenance 
work, it is necessary to bed in the brake shoes before a sufficient holding effect may be 
achieved. Also in this case, the special routine must be activated in the EM F with the 
diagnostic tester. 

The flashing indicator lamp in the instrument cluster signals that the bedding-in program 
is ready. 

The bedding-in program will be aborted and the normal parking brake function resumed 
if the bedding-in is not started within 30 minutes of program activation or if the ignition is 
switched off. 

The bedding-in procedure can also be performed on the roller dynamometer.

Function on Brake Rolling Dynamometer 

The Operation of the E70 parking brake can be tested on the brake rolling dynamometer. 
As part of the road inspection, the rear axle brake can be tested with the engine running 
by pulling the EM F button. 

As part of the road inspection, the rear axle brake can be tested with the engine running 
by pulling the EM F button. As a result, the EM F actuating unit is applied, the duo-servo 
brake is applied and the vehicle normally jumps out of the roller of the test rig.
