NewTransmissions for E70 


The GA6HPTU gearbox is a further development of the known automatic gearbox 
GA6HP. The re-engineered automatic gearbox provides a distinct boost in dynamics 
while at the same time improving fuel consumption and pollutant emission. 

The E70 is equipped with an electric gearshift system similarto the system in the E65. 

In this case, however, the automatic gearbox is not operated from a steering column stalk 
but rather from a selector lever that is located in the standard position on the center 
console. 



The shift pattern is largely modeled on a conventional gearshift with mechanical link to 
the automatic gearbox. The electronic transmission control (EGS) has been adapted to 
the changes/modifications. 

This reference manual only deals with the changes and modifications to the GA6HP 
gearbox. 

Changes 

The automatic gearbox GA6HPTU forthe E70 has been reengineered in terms of the 
following points: 

• Torque converter with turbine-torsion damper 

• Clutch E 

• Adapted electronic transmission control (EGS) 

• Faster hydraulics through new pressure regulator 

• Electric gearshift

Gear Selector Lever (G WS) 


The automatic gearbox in the E70 is operated by means of an electric gearshift system. 
This system is already known from the E65. Unlike in the E65,the gear selector lever in 
the E70 is not on the steering column but rather in the usual position on the center 
console.

The gear selector lever consists of the selector lever itself with indicator and the housing 
with the control unit. 

Operation and Functions 

The shift pattern is modeled on the conventional BMW automatic gearbox. It features an 
automatic gate and a manual gate. 0 nly the parking lock is not engaged by pushing the 
selector leverforward but rather by pressing a button at the top of the selector lever. 

The selector lever is monostable in both gates (manual and automatic). This means, after 
being moved, the selector lever always returns to its initial position. In the manual gate 
this is the same as automatic gearboxes with Steptronic. 

10 

E70 Transmissions 













In addition to the one-touch function, the selector lever can also be pushed in the 
automatic gate. This is comparable to the function of the direction indicator stalk in the 
E90. 

The drive range is changed by tapping the selector lever. A direct change from "D" to "R" 
or vice versa can be achieved by tapping the selector lever twice or by pushing the lever. 

The Unlock button is located on the left-hand side of the selector lever. 

Haptic Locks 

Electrically controlled, mechanically actuated locks ensure that the selector lever can only 
be pushed in the logically possible direction, e.g. only forward from "D". 

These locks are also used forthe shift lock function, i.e. when a drive range can be 
engaged only by pressing the unlock button. The selector lever is not locked if it is 
necessary to depress the service brake in orderto engage a drive range for example. 

Instead, the function is not executed and a message appears in the on-board monitor 
indicating: "Press brake to engage gear". The lock for moving the leverforward differs 
from the lock for moving the lever back. The forward lock is a double lock and can 
therefore prevent over-pressing the lever when a flick is possible. 

In contrast to this, the backward lock can only completely prevent the movement. 
Wheneverthe selector lever can be pulled back, it can also be pulled back beyond the 
stop even if it no longer has a function. 

The following graphics illustrate the operating options. The arrows indicate: 

• Yellow arrow - M ovement possible only with unlock button pressed. 

• Grey arrow - M ovement not possible. 

• Green arrow - M ovement possible.

Operating options of the gear selector lever 


Shift from "P 1 



A drive range or neutral "N" can be engaged from "P" 
only with the unlock button pressed and the service 
brake depressed. 

• Fully pressing forward selects the drive stage "R". 

• Pressing forward selects the neutral position "N". 

• Pressing back selects the drive range "D". 

• Fully pressing back is possible but has no function 
as "D" has already been engaged at this time. 

The selector lever is not locked if the brake pedal is not 
locked - movement is possible but the EGS will not 
engage the drive range or "N".

Engaging a drive range from "N" at a speed < 5 km/h is 
possible only with the service brake pressed. The selec¬ 
tor lever, however, is not locked. 

At a speed > 5 km/h, the drive range can be engaged in 
the corresponding direction without having to press the 
brake pedal.

• Pressing forward is prevented by a lock. 



The EGS engages drive range "D" only when the service 
brake is pressed. Otherwise "N" is selected.The selec¬

Pressing back selects the neutral position "N". 


Pressing fully back selects the drive range "D". 


Manual Gate, Sport Program (M/S) 

As before, the sport program is engaged by shifting the selector leverto the left. 

The selector lever locks in this position. The sport program can only be engaged 
from "D". 

Parking Lock "P" 

The parking lock "P" is engaged by pressing the button at the top of the selector lever 
when the vehicle speed is < 2 km/h. 

The gearbox also automatically selects "P" as soon as the engine is turned off and "N" is 
not engaged. 

Automatic Downshiftfrom "M/S" 

The automatic downshift function returns the selector leverfrom the "M/S" gate to the 
automatic gate. 

This occurs, for example, when the EGS signals gearbox position "P" as is the case when 
the engine is shutdown orthe "P" button is pressed. 

The selector lever remains locked in the "M/S" gate only if "S" or "M" mode is actually 
active while driving in forward direction orthe automatic downshift is defective or receives 
no power supply. 

5 downshift attempts are executed at intervals of approximately 5 seconds if the selector 
lever is blocked from the outside, e.g. by an object. 

If the downshift cannot be executed, the check control message: "M ove selector lever 
back into automatic gate" appears aftertwo attempts. A fault code memory entry is 
generated.

E70 Transmissions 






Interface to EGS 

With the aim of increasing availability, the gear selector lever position is sent via the 
PT-CAN and LIN-bus. This means, a signal is still sent to the EGS should the PT-CAN 
fail. This is not necessary for safety reasons. 

Safety is guaranteed by neutrally complementary signals or alive counters. The gear 
selector switch (GWS) is woken by a high-level on the PT-CAN wake-up line. The GWs 
itself has no active wake-up capabilities.

Communication 

The data blocks are sent both event controlled as well as cyclically on the PT-CAN. 

They are sent only cyclically on the LIN-bus. Complementary signals are sentforthe 
purpose of securing the transmission link. 

These signals are compared with the actual signals in the respective receive control unit. 
Alive counters serve the purpose of detecting defects in the transmit control unit. 

The alive counter in the respective receive control unit is monitored to establish whether 
it remains at a constant value. 

A plausibility check between the signals of the PT-CAN transmission and of the LIN-bus 
does not take place in the receive control unit. 

Safe Status for Sending 

If a GWS-internal plausibility check determines that the position of the selector lever can 
be transmitted incorrectly, the system assumes the safe status for sending the message 
"Operation of gear selector lever". 

Consequently, all signals of this message are sent invalid on the PT-CAN and the 
LIN-bus. If it is not possible to ensure that the signals can be sent invalid, the sending of 
these messages is completely deactivated. 


14 

E70 Transmissions 
























Indicator in the Gear Selector Lever 

The task of the indicator in the gear selector lever (GWS) is to reliably indicate the drive 
range currently engaged. The indicator consists of the locator light that represents the 
shift pattern and the function lighting. This comprises the various position LEDs that 
indicate the drive range currently engaged. 

The function lights in the gear selector lever are controlled by the "Indicate gearbox data" 
message sentfrom the EGS. It is necessary to monitorthe function lighting. Forthis 
purpose, the indication is read back and compared with the required indication. 

The indicator is active as soon as bus communication is active on the PT-CAN orthe 
LIN-bus. 

Flashing of a Position LED 

A position LED flashing draws the driver's attention to incorrect operation. The locator 
lighting remains constant and does notflash. The flashing action is triggered by an EGS 
signal. The frequency is 0.5 Hz. 

Indicator Flashing Through Diagnosis 

The entire function lighting can be made to flash at a frequency of 1 Hz for approximately 
10 seconds by means of a diagnosis job fortesting the indicator. 

Secure Indicator Status 

The indicator is a safety-relevant function so that incorrect indication must be prevented. 
The system assumes the secure indicator status if the possibility of an incorrect 
indication cannot be ruled out. 

The function lighting is switched off forthis purpose. The locator lighting remains 
switched on. 

Transferto the secure status can be triggered by two events: 

• Defective communication on the bus or 

• An internal defect in the gear selector lever 

The main transmission path to the EGS is the PT-CAN. If the "Display gearbox data" 
message is not received correctly on the PT-CAN, the gear selector lever will change over 
to the LIN-bus. If, after changing overto the LIN-bus, a fault is also detected on this 
communication path, the system will assume the secure status. The plausibility check of 
the LIN-bus is constantly executed in the background. If it is necessary to change overto 
the LIN-bus in the event of a defect, it is possible to switch directly to the secure indicator 
state if the system detects beforehand that there are problems with the communication 
on the LIN-bus. 


15 

E70 Transmissions 



A fault code entry is generated in response to changing overto the secure status due to 
communication problems. This fault situation is irreversible. If the "Display gearbox data" 
message is received correctly again, the indicator will be activated normally once again 
after 2 seconds. 

The gear selector lever immediately changes overto the secure indicator status if the 
diagnostic function in the gear selector lever detects an implausibility regarding the 
indicator. 

In this case, a corresponding fault code entry is generated. This fault case is not 
reversible until the next time the gear selector lever assumes sleep mode. 

Park and Unlock Button 

Evaluating the P-button 

The P-button sends the driver's choice to apply the parking lock to the EGS. 

• The P-button is read by means of two contacts in inverse logic. 

• The two contacts are evaluated in separate logic and represented by the two signals 
PI and P2 independent of each other. 

• Before being sent, the P2 signal is inverted in the gear selector lever. 

• The two contacts in the gear selector lever are compared for diagnostic purposes. 

A fault code entry is stored if different contacts are applied for longer than 2 
seconds. 

• An internal diagnostic function in the gear selector lever detects a defective contact 
and enters a corresponding fault code in the fault code memory. 

• The button sticking is detected when at least one contact is applied for longerthan 
2 minutes. 

• The PI and P2 signals are sent independent of each other on the PT-CAN and 
redundantly on the LIN-bus to the EGS. 

• Due to the confirmation tolerances, one signal can be sent as confirmed before the 
other. 

If the required conditions are met (speed, etc.), the EGS will engage the parking lock 
when at least one signal (PI and/or P2) was sent as confirmed. 


16 

E70 Transmissions 




Evaluating the Unlock Button 

The lock to shift to "R" or out of "P" is released by pressing the unlock button. 

• The unlock button is read by means of two contacts in inverse logic. 

• The two contacts in the gear selector lever are compared for diagnostic purposes. 

A fault code entry is stored if different contacts are applied for longerthan 2 
seconds. 

• An internal diagnostic function in the gear selector lever detects a defective contact 
and enters a corresponding fault code in the fault code memory. 

• Before being sent, the P2 signal is inverted in the gear selector lever. 

• The button sticking is detected when at least one contact is applied for longerthan 
2 minutes. 

• Both signals are sent on the PT-CAN and redundantly on the LIN-bus to the EGS as 
soon as a contact is detected as confirmed. 

Components 

Sensors 

The selector lever position is detected without contact with the aid of seven Hall sensors 
for detecting the selector lever position in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle as well 
as four Hall sensors for detecting the selector lever position in the transverse direction of 
the vehicle. 

In the event of one individual sensor failing, the software in the gear selector lever is still 
capable of calculating the correct position of the selector lever. 

Actuators 

Three actuators are used. A motor with subsequently connected gear mechanism is 
used forshifting out ofthe "M/S" gate and forthe lock (inhibit)to "M/S". 

A bi-directional spring-centered double magnet is used forthe inhibit in "R" direction. 

A single magnet with spring reset is used forthe inhibit in "D" direction. The actuators 
do not inhibit the shift to "R" and "D" in the case of fault or if no power is applied. 


17 

E70 Transmissions 



Emergency Release of Parking Lock 

In the case of emergency (e.g. failure of the system voltage), the parking lock can be 
released by correspondingly operating the emergency release. 

To access the emergency release, the rubber inlay in the front cup holder is first removed 
and then the cover released by turning in counter-clockwise direction. The emergency 
release is now accessible. 

The vehicle tool kit includes a handle forthe emergency release. This handle is inserted 
in the emergency release. The parking lock is released by turning in clockwise direction. 

The emergency release is locked by pressing down on the handle. The handle forthe 
emergency release of the parking lock is also used forthe emergency release of the 
electro-mechanical parking brake. 



In the event of the system voltage failing, first release the electro-mechanical parking 
brake (EM F) as the handle remains in the emergency release. 

Note: Do not remove the handle from the emergency release while the 
vehicle is being towed as this will reengage the parking lock. 

Releasing the parking lock with the emergency release generates 
a fault code entry in the EGS: "Parking lock release error"

Casing and Intermediate Plate 

The casing and the intermediate plate of the GA6HPTU gearbox have been adapted to 
the new hydraulic unit and the resulting channel arrangement. 

The GA6HPTU gearbox is a reengineered version of the 6-speed automatic gearboxthat 
was introduced in the E65 and since then used in all model series. 

The modifications are specifically targeted at achieving higher dynamics, lowerfuel 
consumption and reduced pollutant emissions. 


19 

E70 Transmissions 






























Torque Converter 

A new torque converter is used in the GA6HPTU gearbox. This torque converter 
contains an effective torsion damper system known as the turbine-torsion damper (TTD). 

This is a classic torsion damper, in which the primary side (engine side) is fixed to the tur¬ 
bine wheel of the torque converter. This arrangement brings about an increase in the 
flywheel mass on the primary side thus distinctly improving the damping properties.

E70 Transmissions 































































With the converter lockup clutch disengaged, i.e. in converter mode, the powerflow from 
the turbine wheel does not take place in the usual mannerto the transmission input shaft. 
The turbine wheel transmits the powerto the primary side of the torsion damper. 

The secondary side of the turbine-torsion damper is connected to the input shaft of the 
gearbox. 

Since the converter transmits no vibrations, the torsion damper need not perform any 
damping work. In this case it functions virtually as a rigid transmission element. 

When the converter lockup clutch is engaged, the power is transmitted directly from the 
clutch to the primary side of the turbine torsion damper. Due to the rigid connection to 
the turbine wheel of the torque converter, the flywheel mass is increased on the primary 
side. 

The power is transmitted via the turbine-torsion damperto the input shaft of the gearbox. 
Torsional vibration is filtered out very effectively. 

With this system, it is possible to engage (close) the converter lockup clutch much earlier 
without having to take any deterioration in comfort into account. This arrangement 
directly connects the gearboxto the engine, resulting in a boost in dynamics as well as a 
reduction in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. 

Clutches 

The clutch E has been reworked. The clutch E is a drive clutch that connects the ring 
gear of the single planetary geartrain with the long planet gear of the double planetary 
geartrain. 

It is closed in fourth, fifth and sixth gear. The lining of clutch E is made from a new 
material that offers greater stability in terms of vibration and squeaking. 


21 

E70 Transmissions 



Mechatronics Module 


Converter lockup clutch connection stages 

The ability of the new torque converterto dampen torsional vibration with the turbine 
torsion damper is used to keep the converter lockup clutch closed as often as possible. 
This means the gearbox is connected directly to the engine. 

A general statement as to under what conditions the converter lockup clutch is 
disengaged (open) or engaged (closed) can still not be made as this depends on very 
many factors. 

• Load choice signal (accelerator pedal position) 

• Engine load status 

• Vehicle speed 

• Transmission fluid temperature 

• Selected gearshift program 

The following graphic, however, shows the strategy as to when the converter lockup 
clutch should be disengaged or engaged, i.e. when converter lockup clutch control is 
required.

As the previous graphic illustrates, the converter lockup clutch is engaged (closed) (1) 
over large ranges during vehicle operation. The clutch is only controlled in the low speed 
ranges (2 +3). Greater slip (3) is permitted in response to high load requirements in 
orderto avoid the generation of noise and vibration. 

22 

E70 Transmissions 















When the load requirement is low, the slip at the converter lockup clutch is also kept low 
to enable a more direct connection. For reasons of simplicity, the previous graphic does 
not illustrate when the converter lockup clutch is open, e.g. when the vehicle is stationary 
or when starting off. 

The driver experiences the direct link from the engine to the gearbox as a distinct boost in 
dynamics. Output speed follows the engine speed when the foot is pressed down and 
lifted off the accelerator. There is no familiar jump in engine speed as illustrated in the 
following graphic.

Target gear allocation dependent on accelerator pedal gradient 

Target gear allocation dependent on the accelerator pedal gradient replaces the previous 
target gear allocation system dependent on the accelerator pedal forthe purpose of 
shifting down while accelerating. 


In the case of accelerator-dependent target gear allocation, based on the respective 
downshift characteristic curves, the EGS determines whether a downshift is necessary 
while accelerating.

The gearbox shifts down by one gear if the accelerator pedal is pressed and the first 
downshift characteristic is reached within a certain time. If the accelerator pedal is 
pressed further, the gearbox shifts down again to the second downshift characteristic and 
again to response to the third downshift characteristic. 

In the case of accelerator pedal gradient dependent target gear allocation, the EGS deter¬ 
mines the target gear already at the first downshift characteristic. 

The accelerator pedal gradient is used forthis purpose. This is the angle the movement 
of the accelerator pedal currently described or expressed more simply, the speed at 
which the accelerator pedal is depressed. 


24 

E70 Transmissions 




















The target gear which is now determined in connection with the first downshift 
characteristic is engaged by a multiple downshift function. This serves as a boost to 
overall dynamics as the corresponding gear is engaged earlier and the interruption in 
tractive power is minimized.

S hift S peed C haracteristics 

The transmission control now has three different shift speed levels known as quickshift 1, 
2 and 3. The higherthe level, the fasterthe gearshift. The respective shift speed level is 
selected as a function of the selected drive program ("D", "S" or "M") and the accelerator 
pedal gradient, i.e. as a function of the speed at which the pedal is depressed. The table 
below shows an overview of the shift speed levels:

Torque Intervention 

When shifting gear at low load or when coasting, the EGS sends a so-called torque pulse 
to the engine management in orderto achieve a torque intervention. This is negative 
when upshifting so that the engine speed is reduced. When downshifting while coasting, 
the torque intervention is positive in orderto boost the engine speed. This torque inter¬ 
vention facilitates smooth gearshifts without the torque converter having to intervene in 
this task. 

LIN-Bus Module 

The EGS now contains a LIN-bus module for communication with the gear selector lever 
(GWS). 

Electronic-hydraulic Control 

The electronic-hydraulic control installed in the GA6HP19/26TU has been optimized in 
the following areas with regard to faster gearshift operations and higher efficiency. 

• Torque converter control 

• Cooling oil flow 

• System pressure in "R" 

• Clutch valves 

• Electronic pressure control valves 

The electronic-hydraulic control now has only two solenoid valves but seven electronic 
pressure control valves.

Torque Converter Control 

The torque converter control including the converter lockup clutch has undergone 
distinct improvements with regard to the control capabilities under all conditions. 

It is equipped with a new pressure regulator. Raised converter pressure (increased from 
approximately 0.5 barto 1 bar at the low end) ensures faster control ofthe converter 
lockup clutch particularly at low temperatures. 

The oil feed comes from the primary connection ofthe main pressure control valve, thus 
improving control at low speeds. The converter lockup clutch is now engaged with a 
backpressure in order to proportionate more effectively. 

Variable Cooling Oil Flow 

The flow of cooling oil is variable in orderto reduce power losses. No cooling is required 
forthe clutch faces when the converter lockup clutch is engaged (closed). The flow of 
cooling oil can be reduced in this state thus also reducing the pump power. The flow of 
cooling oil is controlled by the main pressure and can vary between 10 l/min and 15 l/min

System Pressure in Reverse Gear 

The system pressure that is applied in reverse gear has been increased from 15 barto 16 
bar. This change caters forthe highertorque and the higher possible total weight. It 
ensures that clutch slip is prevented even in extreme situations (e.g. uphill gradient with 
trailer). 

Clutch Valves 

The clutch valves now exhibit a smaller control space. This facilitates a more sponta¬ 
neous response as the time required until the clutch valve reacts to the control pressure 
applied bythe EDS is shorter.This results in distinctly shorter gearshift times. 

Solenoid Valves (MV) 

Two solenoid valves are mounted on the hydraulic selector unit. These valves are 
designed as 3/2-way valves, i.e. valves with three connections and two switch positions. 

The solenoid valves are controlled bythe electronic transmission control (EGS) and 
assume the "opened" or "closed" positions making it possible to switch overthe 
hydraulic valves. 

The two solenoid valves are used forthe electronically switched parking lock. 

One solenoid valve controls the valve forthe parking lock and the other solenoid valve 
locks the cylinderforthe parking lock. 

Electronic Pressure Control Valves (EDS) 

The electronic pressure control valves convert electrical current into a proportional 
hydraulic pressure. They are driven bythe EGS and operate the hydraulic valves belong¬ 
ing to the shift elements. 

The solenoid valve that the EDS (4) in the predecessor model assigned to the clutches 
(D and E) depending on the gearto be shifted is no longer required. Instead another 
electronic pressure control valve is used so that each clutch is now controlled by its own 
electronic pressure control valve. 

The pressure control valve 7 maintains a constant system pressure during the gearshift 
operations, thus making shorter shift times possible. 

The tasks of the electronic pressure control valves are listed in the following:

Three different electronic pressure control valves (EDS) are now installed which are all 
resistant to low temperatures. They enable stable presentation of the gearshift 
requirements even at low temperatures and when the transmission fluid is cold:

Emergency Release of Parking Lock 

In the event of the system voltage failing, first release the electro-mechanical parking 
brake (EM F) as the handle remains in the emergency release. 

Do not remove the handle from the emergency release while the vehicle is being towed 
as this will reengage the parking lock. 

Releasing the parking lock with the emergency release generates a fault code entry in the 
EGS: "Parking lock release error"
