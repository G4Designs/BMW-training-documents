E70 Central Locking 



Introduction 


The central locking is the central vehicle access system. It is responsible for unlocking 
and locking the vehicle. The central locking controls all vehicle doors, the upper section 
of the two-piece tailgate and the fuel filler flap. 

The central locking can be operated via the following components: 

• Remote control 

• Driver's door lock barrel (door lock) 

• Center lock button 

• Exterior tailgate button 

• Identification transmitter and outer door handle electronic module TAGE for Comfort 
Access. 

A correspondingly adapted electrical system taken from the E90 is used in the E70. 
Forthis reason, many components and functions stem from the E90. 

The Car Access System now features the third generation of control units. The electron¬ 
ic vehicle immobilizer 4 is also used in connection with the Car Access System 3. 

The Car Access System 3 is backwards compatible with the Car Access System 2. 
Therefore, the Car Access System 3 contains all the functions of its predecessor. 

It is possible to open and close the vehicle both actively or passively. 

Active means the vehicle is unlocked by pressing the button on the remote control and 
can then be opened. 

After closing the doors, the vehicle can be locked by pressing the Lock button. 

Option SA 322 Comfort Access is required forthe passive opening and closing function. 

Passive means the vehicle is unlocked by grasping the outer door handle, provided the 
identification transmitter is located within a radius of no more than approximately 2 m 
from the vehicle. The locking function is triggered by touching the sensitive area on the 
outer door handle. 

A furtheroption is SA 323 Automatic Soft-Close Function.The automatic soft-close 
function is available for all vehicle doors. When equipped with the automatic soft-close 
function, the vehicle door needs only to be gently pulled or pushed into the lock. The 
automatic soft-close function then completely closes the door. 

The central locking system is responsible for locking and unlocking the vehicle and 
incorporates the vehicle doors, tailgate and fuel filler flap. 

Note: The lower section of the tailgate is fully mechanical and can be opened 
as soon as the uppersection has been opened.

The signal from the remote control is received via the rear window antenna (31). The 
remote control receiver integrated in the diversity module (30) forwards the signal to the 
Car Access System 3 (29). After successfully checking the signal, the Car Access 
System 3 initiates activation of the central locking. The Car Access System 3 is the cen¬ 
tral control unitforthe central locking. 

The junction box control unit (26) executes the vehicle unlocking and locking functions. 

Thefootwell module (23) evaluates the status of all door contacts (4, 7,19 and 22). It 
makes available the respective status via the K-CAN. In this way, the Car Access System 
3 can prevent the vehicle being locked with the driver's door open. 

The junction box control unit evaluates the status of the center lock button (25). The 
junction box control unit activates the central locking corresponding to the status. The 
junction box control unit is also responsible for registering the status and activating the 
central locking in the tailgate. 

In addition, the junction box control unit drives the fuel fillerflap (10). 

The footwell module evaluates the signals from the Hall sensors forthe lock barrel (22) 
and makes this information available on the K-CAN. 

Based on this information, the Car Access System 3 is informed of the status of the door 
lock in the driver's door. This is important forthe case when a request to unlock or lock 
the vehicle is triggered via the remote control.

System Components 


Control Units 

Footwell Module (FRM) 

The footwell module is installed at the left-hand A-pillar. It evaluates the status of the 
door contacts and reads in the Hall sensor signals of the lock barrel in the driver's door 
and transfers the information via the K-CAN to the junction box control unit or Car 
Access System 3. 

Car Access System 3 

The Car Access System 3 is installed on the left next to the steering column. It assumes 
the masterfunction forthe central locking. The Car Access System 3 has the exclusive 
system authorization and is simply supported by the other control units. 

J unction Box Control Unit (J B) 

The junction box control unit is plugged into the front power distribution box. 

The junction box control unit contains the relays for activating the central locking drive 
units. 

The tailgate central locking is activated via a power output stage in the junction box con¬ 
trol unit. The drive unit forthe automatic soft close function is powered by a relay in the 
rear power distribution box. The junction box control unit activates the relay. 

The signals from the exterior tailgate button and center-lock button are also sentto the 
junction box control unit and transferred to the Car Access System 3. 

The remote control receiver is powered by the rear power distribution box. 

Note: The power distribution box and the junction box control unit are two 

separate components. Keep this in mind when performing service work.

Central Locking Drive Units 

A central locking drive unit consists of an electric drive unit and the unlocking/locking 
mechanism. 

Doors 

The central locking drive units in the doors are equipped with two motors to facilitate the 
unlocking/locking and central arrest functions of the vehicle. 

Central arrest means that the locking button in the doors is separated mechanically from 
the central locking drive unit. 

As a result, the vehicle cannot be opened by pulling the locking button. 

The Hall sensorforthe door contact is additionally integrated in the central locking drive 
unit. 

Tailgate and Fuel Filler Flap 

The central locking drive units forthe tailgate and fuel fillerflap are each equipped with a 
motorforunlocking/locking purposes. 

The central locking drive unit in the tailgate contains the tailgate contact. The tailgate 
contact serves the purpose of signalling tailgate "OPEN" or "CLOSED". 

The tailgate is additionally equipped with the drive unit forthe automatic soft-close func¬ 
tion. This drive unit also features a motor. 

The automatic soft-close drive unit also has a contactforthe automatic soft-close func¬ 
tion.

E70 Central Locking 
























Unlocking 

As soon as the unlock button on the remote control is pressed, the signal initially reaches 
the rear window antenna followed by the remote control receiver. The remote control 
receiver is located in the diversity module and forwards the signal to the Car Access 
System 3. The signal from the remote control is verified in the Car Access System 3. If 
the signal is recognized as valid, the junction box control unit is enabled forthe purpose 
of unlocking the central locking drive units. The junction box control unit now activates 
the relay as well as the power output stages to triggerthe vehicle unlocking procedure. 

Locking 

The vehicle can be locked only afterthe footwell module has evaluated the door contacts 
and the Car Access System 3 signals that the doors are closed. 

The further signal progression for locking the vehicle corresponds analogously to the sig¬ 
nal progression ofthe unlocking procedure. 

All central locking drive units are moved to the "lock" position while the vehicle is being 
locked. 

The central locking drive units in the doors additionally assume the "central arrest" posi¬ 
tion. Following the central arrest procedure, the locking buttons in the doors are mechani¬ 
cally separated from the central locking drive system. 

The vehicle can now no longer be unlocked using the locking buttons in the doors. 

Central Locking Button 

The vehicle can be locked/unlocked with the center-lock button. 

The junction box control unit receives a high signal (battery voltage approximately. 12 V) 
when the center-lock button is not pressed. The high signal changes to a low signal 
(approximately. 0 V) as soon as the center-lock button is pressed. 

The junction box control unit evaluates the change from the high signal to the low signal 
and locks/unlocks the vehicle. 

Mechanical Key 

The footwell module evaluates the Hall sensors forthe lock barrel in the driver's door. The 
Car Access System 3 is informed ofthe change in status via the K-CAN. 

The Car Access System 3 enables the vehicle unlocking/locking procedure. The junction 
box control unit initiates the vehicle unlocking/locking procedure. 

Locking Button on Vehicle Doors 

All four doors can be mechanically locked separately with the locking button. 

To unlock the vehicle door, it is necessary to pull twice on the innerdoor handle. 

However, the junction box control unit does not activate the central locking. 


15 

E70 Central Locking 



Car Access System 3 

As soon as the Car Access System 3 receives the signal from the remote control receiver, 
it checks whetherthe remote control is valid and belongs to the vehicle. Only if the check 
is successful will the Car Access System 3 forward the request to the central locking. 

The check, also referred to as authentication, takes in the order of milliseconds. 

Serving as the master control unit of the central locking system, the Car Access System 
3 issues the enable to activate the central locking. 

The junction box control unit receives the enable via the K-CAN. 

J unction Box Control Unit 

The junction box control unit is the executing control unit and locks/unlocks the complete 
vehicle. The relays forthe unlocking/locking operations are located in the junction box 
control unit.The following relays are activated: 

• Relay for unlocking/locking central locking 

- Driver's door 

• Relay for unlocking/locking central locking 

- Rear doors 

- Front passenger's door 

- Fuel fillerflap 

The central locking forthe tailgate is activated directly via a power output stage. The relay 
forthe automatic soft-close function of the tailgate is also controlled by the junction box 
control unit. 

Footwell Module FRM 

The footwell module monitors the Hall sensors of the door contacts. A status change 
occurs in the door contacts when a door is opened or closed. 

The junction box control unit receives the current status of the door contacts from the 
footwell module via the K-CAN.The junction box control unit forwards the status of the 
door contacts to the Car Access System 3. 

The request to lock the vehicle, for example, is not executed while the driver's door is 
open. 


16 

E70 Central Locking 



Opening the UpperTailgate 

The uppertailgate can be unlocked via the remote control, the exterior or interior tailgate 
release button and then opened. 

Remote Control 

The tailgate is opened with the remote control by pressing on the tailgate symbol. The 
uppertailgate unlocks and can be opened. 

Note: The motor in the tailgate lock and the relay forthe automatic soft-close 
drive unit are activated via power output stages in the junction box con¬ 
trol unit. 

The uppertailgate can also be opened by pressing the tailgate symbol on 
the identification transmitter. 

ExteriorTailgate Button 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked, the uppertailgate can be opened by pressing the 
exterior tailgate button. The button switches to ground when the exterior tailgate button is 
pressed. 

The junction box control unit monitors the button. The uppertailgate is unlocked and can 
be opened when the signal from the button goes to low. 

InteriorTailgate Button 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked, the uppertailgate can be unlocked and opened by 
pressing the interior tailgate button. 

The button is located in the center console switch cluster SZM and switches to ground. 
The center console switch cluster evaluates the button. The signal is made available to 
the control unit of the air conditioning systems. 

The air conditioning system sends the signal via the K-CAN to the junction box control 
unit. 

The junction box control unit evaluates the message and triggers the tailgate unlocking 
procedure. 

C losing the Tailgate 

Closing the tailgate starts the automatic soft close drive unit via a microswitch forthe tail¬ 
gate. The microswitch is located in the tailgate lock. The junction box control unit evalu¬ 
ates the microswitch. The microswitch signal has a high level when the tailgate is open. 

The signal changes to low level when the tailgate is closed. The junction box control unit 
activates the automatic soft-close drive unit until it generates a low signal via its own 
switch contact. Activation ceases and the automatic soft-close drive unit assumes it origi¬ 
nal position.

Note: Closing the tailgate with the automatic soft-close drive unit ensures that 
it is closed reliably while also increasing the vehicle rigidity. The drive 
unit of the automatic soft close function pulls the tailgate into the latch 
mechanism. 

The vehicle body and the tailgate are now firmly connected, thus reduc¬ 
ing the torsional motion orvibration of the tailgate to a minimum. 

Opening and C losing the LowerTailgate 

The lowertailgate is locked mechanically. It can only be unlocked and opened fully 
mechanically when the uppertailgate is opened.

Special Features 


Automatic Locking (personal profile) 

The vehicle is locked automatically when driving at a speed in excess of 16 km/h. The 
speed signal is made available by the dynamic stability control. 

The vehicle is unlocked in connection with Comfort Access as soon as terminal 15 is 
switched off. 

On vehicles without Comfort Access, the unlocking procedure is triggered by removing 
the remote control from its holder. 

Unlocking After a Crash 

A locked central locking system is unlocked as soon as the Car Access System 3 
receives a crash message from the advanced crash safety management. 

On receiving the crash signal, the center-lock button and the remote control receiver are 
inhibited forthe central locking functions.The center-lock button and the remote control 
receiver are enabled again only afterthe change "terminal R OFF/terminal R ON". 

Selective Unlocking 

With corresponding coding, the vehicle can also be unlocked selectively. 

In this case, initially the driver's door is unlocked. 

The rest of the vehicle is unlocked in response to a renewed unlock request.
