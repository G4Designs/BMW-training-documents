The S54B32 is a 4-valve per cylinder dual VANOS naturally aspirated engine with high 
torque and high-rev concepts. High torque is developed by a large volume engine at low 
engine rpm and a long total gear ratio. High-rev is achieved with a small displacement 
"lightweight” (internal components) engine and short total gear ratio. This powertrain pro¬ 
vides the best of both worlds by using a 3.2 Liter in-line 6 cylinder configuration coupled to 
a 6 speed manual transmission. 


Power Output for the E46 M3: 

1. 333 hp at 7900 rpm 

2. 355 Nm of Torque at 4900 rpm 


Power Output for the 
M roadster and M coupe: 

1. 315 hp at 7900 rpm 

2. 340 Nm of Torque at 4900 rpm

System Components 


Engine Block: The 554 engine block is cast iron in order to absorb the high forces pro¬ 
duced by the crankshaft (combustion pressure and high engine rpm). 


The engine block has cast provi¬ 
sions for 3 Knock Sensors and 
and the Crankshaft Position/RPM 
Sensor (on the intake side). 

The cylinder bores are 87 mm in 
diameter and are spaced 91 mm 
on center. 

The "bare” block weighs approxi¬ 
mately 105 lbs. (48 kg). 



11410004.jpg 


Crankshaft and Bearings: The S54 crankshaft is forged steel with 12 counterweights 
and a 91 mm stroke. The crankshaft is supported by 7 (60 mm diameter) main bearings 
with 49 mm diameter connecting rod journals. 


The "thrust" bearing is a multi¬ 
piece shell assembled as a unit 
and is located on the number 6 
main journal of the crankshaft. 


Bearing Clearance: 

1. Main 0.02 - 0.05 mm 

2. Thrust (end play) 0.08 - 0.16 mm 



11410005 .jpg 


The impulse wheel is bolted to the number 6 connecting rod journal counterweight.

The Crankshaft Position/RP M Sensor is mount¬ 
ed on the rear of the engine block (below the 
intake manifold). 

The sensor protrudes through the engine block 
(arrow) to scan the impulse wheel gear teeth. 

The cast sensor mounting is shown from the 
rear view of the engine. 



11410007.jpg 


The torsional vibration damper is specifically 
designed for the higher engine rpm. 

The damper is secured by 4 bolts which must 
be angle torqued (refer to Repair Instructions 
and Technical Data). 

Note the installation location for the crankshaft 
position locating tool (arrow). 



11410008.jpg

M Engines - S54B32 






Connecting Rods and Bearings: The 554 uses reinforced forged steel "cracked" 
connecting rods: 


1. Length = 139 mm 

2. Small End (Integrated Bushing) 
Diameter = 21 mm 

3. Large End Diameter = 49 mm 



11410009.jpg 


The "cracked" connecting rod refers to the cap which 
is split off leaving rough surfaces on both the cap and 
the rod. 

Centering of the cap on the rod is carried out through 
the structure of the split which eliminates the alignment 
sleeves. Pairing codes are stamped into the rod to 
ensure proper installation of the cap. 

The S54 connecting rods are weight-optimized (+/- 4 
grams). Only one set of connecting rods (the same 
weight class) is available to maintain balance. 





J i ■ 


HH.ry. 




The connecting rod bolts must be angle torqued (refer ii4ioooo.bmp 
to Repair Instructions and Technical Data). The bolts 
can not be replaced separately, if damaged; the con¬ 
necting rod must be replaced (supplied with new 
bolts). 


The 554 connecting rod bearings use end mounted 
locating tabs. 


Notes: 



11410010.bmp

M Engines - S54B32 



























Pistons and Piston Rings: The S54 uses graphite 
coated cast aluminum (full slipper skirt) pistons with 
valve recesses. 

The piston diameter is 86.965 mm, weighs approxi¬ 
mately 470 grams with a compression ratio of 11.5:1. 

Install the pistons with the arrow pointing towards the 
front of the engine. 



Piston Rings: 


1. Compression Ring 1 = 1.2 mm Height 

2. Compression Ring 2 = Stepped Face 1.5 mm Height 

3. Oil Control Ring = Beveled, Spring Loaded 2 mm Height 


A Special Tool (ring compressor) is required to install 
the pistons. 


11410065.eps 



The pistons are cooled by oil spray nozzles that are 
bolted into the crankcase. 

The nozzles are "tapped" into the main oil gallery and 
delivers a constant oil spray to the underside of the pis¬ 
tons. 


The wrist pins are 21 mm in diameter and have tapered 
ends (inside diameter) for weight reduction.

The recommended oil for the S54 is CASTROL TWS MOTORSPORT SAE 10W-60 or 
CASTROL FORMULA RS 10W-60 SYNTHETIC OIL - PN 07 51 0 009 420 (refer to SIB 
#00 02 00 and 11 06 01). Oil Capacity: Refer to Technical Data or the Oil Capacity 
Chart found in the Service Information Bulletin.

M Engines - S54B32 















































Oil Pump: The 554 oil pump is two stage, supply and scavenge. The pump is driven by 
the crankshaft with a single row chain. 


The oil pump has two separate chambers, the scavenge chamber (1) draws oil from the 
pickup at the front of the oil pan. The oil is transferred from the pump through a small pipe 
to the main sump at the rear of the oil pan (2). 

The supply chamber (3) draws oil from the main sump through a large pipe (4) to supply oil 
to the main gallery. The main gallery circuit returns to the pump housing which contains the 
oil pressure control piston. 


3 



The oil pressure is tested at the oil filter housing using 
the Special Tool #90 88 6 114 390 (adapting retainer 
bolt and pressure gauge as shown in the Repair 
Instructions). 


The adapter retainer bolt replaces the oil filter housing 
cover retaining bolt and provides an adapter fitting for 
the oil pressure gauge.

M Engines - S54B32 
























Crankcase Ventilation: The S54 features a non-pressurized sealed crankcase ventilation 
system for the blow-by vapors. 


1. Intake Manifold 

2. Oil Pan 

3. Oil Separator (Labyrinth) 

4. Cylinder Head Cover 

5. Drainback Tube 

6. Crankcase Vapor Inlet 

7. Crankcase Vapor Outlet 
(To Intake Manifold) 

8. Condensate Return to Oil Pan 
(With C heck Valve) 

9. Condensate Return To Oil Pan 



11410013 .jpg 

The crankcase blow-by vapors are "purged" by intake manifold vacuum. The vapors are 
drawn from the cylinder head cover (4) through the inlet of the Oil Separator (6). The 
Labyrinth (3) separates the oil from the vapors, and the condensate (oil) returns to the oil 
pan through the return line (9). The vapors exit the Oil Separatorthrough the outlet hose (7) 
to the intake manifold to be inducted into the combustion chambers. 

When the engine is running, intake manifold vacuum will close the Check Valve in the return 
line (8). When the engine is not running, the Check Valve will open. This allows any con¬ 
densation (oil) that have collected in the intake manifold to drain back to the oil pan through 
the dipstick tube. 

Sealing Washers Port Seals 

The cylinder head cover is sealed by a perime- 
terseal, spark plug port seals and sealing wash¬ 
ers under the retaining bolts. 

These individual seals must all be properly 
installed to prevent oil and vacuum leaks. 

11410016.tiff

M Engines - S54B32 









Cylinder Head: The S54 features an aluminum cross-flow cylinder head designed as a sin 
gle component that houses the camshafts and valve train. 



11410018.tiff 


11410015 jpg 



The combustion chamber reveals the 4 valve per cylinder arrangement and the optimized 
(flow enhanced) intake and exhaust ports. The spark plugs are centrally located in the com¬ 
bustion area for the most effective power and reduced emission outputs. 

To remove the cylinder head, the camshafts must first be removed to access the cylinder 
head bolts (refer to the Repair Instructions). The timing chain guide rail bolt must also be 
removed (upper picture #1) and the special sealing washer must be replaced. 

To pressure test the cylinder head, a Special Tool (Pressure Tester Adapter Kit) is required. 

Cylinder head machining is not permitted.

The S54 uses a high efficiency water pump (4) to enhance the Cross Flow cylinder head 
design. 


The cross-flow design ensures even temperature distribution through out the cylinder head. 
The coolant flows from the engine block on the exhaust side into the cylinder head. 


The coolant flows through (across) the cylinder head and exits at the intake side through 
three outlets (6,7,8). The coolant is routed through the Return Pipe (9) to the thermostat 
housing (2).

The chain is routed from the crankshaft over a guide rail 
to the intake and exhaust camshaft sprockets. A two 
piece hydraulically tensioned guide rail lubricates (three 
oil outlets provided) and "self adjusts” the chain. 



Oil Outlets 


11410014.eps 


Camshafts: The 554 cast iron overhead camshafts are hol¬ 
low and are strengthened by heat treating the journals and 
cam lobes. The duration and lift (12 mm) of the lobes are the 
same on both camshafts. 

The camshafts are not interchangeable, therefore they should 
be marked before disassembly. 

The camshaft lobes have oil grooves (shown by arrows to the 
right) that provide lubrication from the camshaft journals to the 
lobes and the valve fingers. 


The camshafts must be removed and installed with the press 
fixture (Special Tool #90 88 6 114 380 as shown in the Repair 
Instructions). 




The camshafts are "timed" with the bridged location tool 
(pinned into camshaft as shown in the Repair Instructions).

11410021.bmp 


The camshafts are supported by 7 bearing jour¬ 
nals machined into the cylinder head. 


The bearing journal caps are location specific. 
The markings are: 


1 . 

E=lntake Side Number 2-7 

2. 

A=Exhaust Side Number 2-7 



11410018.jpg 


The first camshaft bearing journal also serves 
as the thrust bearing (unmarked). 

This two-piece bearing flange is forged to sup¬ 
port VANOS axial loads. 

The thrust bearing flange is bolted to the face 
of the cylinder head. This component is not sep¬ 
arately available because the journals are 
machined with the cylinder head. 



11410021 .jpg 


15 

M Engines - S54B32 





An impulse wheel is mounted on the end of 
each camshaft for position detection. The 
impulse wheels are secured by a removable bolt 
( 1 ). 

The intake camshaft impulse wheel has 6 lugs 
and the exhaust camshaft impulse wheel has 7 
lugs (with gap). 



Valve Train: The camshaft lobe actuates the 
valve finger (rocker arm) which rotates on a fin¬ 
ger (rocker) shaft. The valve finger is secured by 
a spring clip and contacts the valve clearance 
shim (9 mm diameter) to open the valve. 


The adjustable valve clearance set by various 
shim thickness is: 


1 . 

Intake 0.18 - 0.23mm 

2. 

Exhaust 0.28-0.33mm 

* 

Set With Engine Temperature < 35° C 


Two feeler gages and a holder with a magnetic 
tip (Special Tools) are required to adjust the 
valve clearance. The cam lobe must be rotated 
away from the valve finger for maximum clear¬ 
ance. 



To access the valve clearance shim, remove the 
finger securing clip. Slide the finger away from 
the valve spring to expose the shim. Use the 
magnetic tip holder to extract the shim. 


The shims (shown by the arrow to the right) are 
available in sizes from 1.72 to 2.52 mm at 0.04 
mm increments. 



16 

M Engines - S54B32 



































The finger (rocker) shafts are secured with locating 
bolts (one perside) atthe back of the cylinder head (1). 


Remove the threaded access bolts (1) from the rear 
face of the cylinder head and push the shafts through. 



Both finger shafts are hollow, the exhaust shaft 
is unique because it supplies oil to the cam¬ 
shaft bearing journals. 

The exhaust shaft receives oil from the main oil 
gallery through the transfer hole (arrow). 

The intake camshaft is lubricated directly from 
the main oil gallery. 




The valve fingers are identical but must be 
marked for location when previously used. 

Lubrication for the slide contact is provided 
from the camshafts (lobe grooves) and an inlet 
hole (arrow) allows lubrication forthe finger pivot 
journal. 



17 

M Engines - S54B32 
















Valves and Valve Springs: The intake and exhaust 
valves are lightweight in design to reduce reciprocating 
mass. The valve diameter is: 


1 . 

Intake 35 mm 

2. 

Exhaust 30.5 mm 

3. 

Stem-Intake / Exhaust 6.0 mm 


The exhaust valve stems are sodium filled to enhance 
cooling. 

CAUTION! Consult the Repair Instructions before per¬ 
forming any repairs and for proper disposal of sodium 
filled valves. 



The valve spring assembly consists of two progressive 
tensioned valve springs. 


The springs are marked for correct installation due to 
progressive tensioning (paint stripes facing down 
towards cylinder head). 


Notes: 




11410030.tiff

M Engines - S54B32 














VANOS 


Performance, torque, idle characteristics and 
exhaust emissions reduction are improved by 
variable camshaft timing (VANOS). 

The S54 engine uses double VANOS to adjust 
the spread angles of the intake and exhaust 
camshafts. 

This system uses a high pressure (100 Bar) con¬ 
trol system that ensures responsive and accu¬ 
rate camshaft adjustments to meet the high per¬ 
formance requirements of the M Engines. 



The VANOS unit is mounted directly on the front 
of the cylinder head. 

The VANOS unit contains the hydraulically actu¬ 
ated mechanical drives (1), the electronically 
controlled oil pressure regulating solenoids (2) 
and the 100 Bar pressure regulating valve (3). 

The back view of the VANOS unit shows the 
inlet oil supply pressure reducing valve (4) and 
the radial piston high pressure output pump dri¬ 
ven by the exhaust camshaft (5). 



11410072.eps 


The VANOS solenoid electrical assembly (re¬ 
moved from the VANOS unit) contains four sole¬ 
noids. 

Two solenoids are required for each adjusting 
piston circuit, one for advancing and one for 
retarding the camshaft timing. The solenoids are 
controlled by the ECM . 



11410073.eps 


19 

M Engines - S54B32 






















The adjustment shafts contain two sets of 
splines that engage with: 


m 

Camshaft Sleeves (Straight Splines) 

2. 

Chain Driven Sprocket (Helical Splines) 



11410037.jpg 


The camshaft sleeves are bolted to the end of 
the camshafts and engage with the straight 
spline of the adjustment shaft shown above. 



11410074.eps 


The chain driven sprocket and spacer sleeve 
assembly is shown to the right (one assembly 
per camshaft). The sprocket engages with the 
helical splines of the adjustment shaft shown 
above. 

The exhaust camshaft sprocket assembly has 
two drive "lugs” that must be aligned with the 
radial piston oil pump during installation. 



20 

M Engines - S54B32 














VAN05 mechanical operation is dependent on oil pressure applied to position the control 
pistons. The double VANOS camshafts are infinitely adjustable within the mechanical trav¬ 
el limits of the drive gears. 

When oil pressure is applied to the control piston, the piston moves causing the splined 
adjustment shaft to move. The straight splines slide within the camshaft sleeve. The helical 
splines rotate the camshaft drive sprocket changing the position in relation to the camshaft 
position which advances/retards the camshaft timing. 


The total adjustment range of the intake camshaft is 60° 
The total adjustment range of the exhaust camshaft is 45- 


The "default” mechanical stop position without VANOS influence is: 

Intake Camshaft = Retarded (130-spread angle) 
Exhaust Camshaft = Advance (83- spread angle) 


21 

M Engines - S54B32 










































































































Oil is supplied from the main gallery through the 
front of cylinder head (arrow) to the inlet pres¬ 
sure reducing valve. 


Pressure Reducing Valve: The pressure 
reducing valve supplies oil to the radial piston 
high pressure oil pump. It is located between 
the cylinder head and the VANOS unit. 



11410042.tiff 


The valve ensures the oil pressure supply to the 
VANOS pump is 0.5 Bar regardless of the vary¬ 
ing pressure from the main oil pressure gallery. 
The pressure reducing valve is pressed into the 
VANOS unit and secured by an "o-ring”. 



11410080.eps 


100 Bar Pressure Regulating Valve: The 100 

Bar pressure regulating valve is mounted in the 
VANOS unit. This valve regulates the pressure 
produced by the radial piston high pressure oil 
pump. 

Note: The 100 Bar pressure regulating valve is 
not adjustable. 



11410002.eps 



VANOS Accumulator: The VANOS accumula¬ 
tor ensures that there is a sufficient volume of oil 
underpressure to adjustthe camshafts underall 
engine operating conditions. 


The accumulator is Nitrogen charged and is 
located on the exhaust side of the engine be¬ 
hind the A/C compressor. It is connected to the 
VANOS unit by a high pressure line.

VANOS system hydraulic operation: 

When the engine starts, oil from the main engine oil pump is fed under pressure to the 
pressure reducing valve. 

The oil pressure is dropped to approximately 0.5 Bar and fed to the radial piston high 
pressure oil pump. 

The pump is driven by the exhaust camshaft and the 100 bar pressure is built up by the 
pressure regulating valve. The volume of pressurized oil is stored in the accumulator 
supplying both adjustment pistons. Both pistons are held in the default position by the 
high pressure oil. 


23 

M Engines - S54B32 





























































At the same time the high pressure oil is available at the inlet solenoids of both adjust¬ 
ment pistons. 


VANOS adjustment is carried out by the ECM pulsing the inlet and outlet solenoids to 
allow pressurized oil to the back side of the adjustment pistons. The surface area on this 
side of the piston is larger so that the oil pressure is greater and the adjustment piston 
will move causing the valve timing to change. 


The piston is connected to the adjustment shaft. As the piston moves, the shaft turns 
the helical splines varying the camshaft sprocket position in relation to the camshafts. 


CAUTION! The VANOS system is under high pressure (100 Bar). Consult the Repair 
Instructions before performing any repairs. 


Workshop Hints 

When installing the intake camshaft, a visual 
"sight” is the cam lobes on cylinder number 1 
should be pointing horizontally inwards (as 
shown on the right). 

When installing the exhaust camshaft, the cam 
lobes for cylinder number 1 should be pointing 
horizontally inwards (refer to Repair Instruc¬ 
tions for detailed graphics). 



The VANOS function test can be performed by 
using Special Tools: 

#90 88 6 126 411 
#90 88 6 126 050 

Regulated Compressed Air (2-8 bar) 

Refer to the Repair Instructions for the VANOS

Intake Air Plenum: The intake air plenum is 
designed for maximum volume required for the 
554 engine. The air filter housing and intake 
manifold are different on the M roadster and M 
coupe as compared with the M3 due to the 
under hood dimensions. 

The flow characteristics of the one-piece plastic 
shell is enhanced by internal "funnel" cones to 
direct the intake air to the throttle housings. 



11410043 .jpg 

The plenum is attached to the throttle housings 
by rubber sleeves. A Special Tool (clamp pliers) 
is required to secure the one-time use clamps. 



External Air Distribution Pipe j 


11410044.jpg 


Intake Air System: The S54 uses six individual throttle housings operated by an EDR 
actuator (1 electronic throttle control). For low engine speed (low load) and idling, intake air 
is provided by an idle air actuator (2). The valve regulates air flow through an external air 
distribution pipe to the individual throttle housings. Fuel tank vapor intake is regulated by 
the Evaporative Emission Valve (3). 


Refer to the Repair Instructions for the procedure to adjust and synchronize the throttle 
housings. 


25 

M Engines - S54B32 





Fuel Supply: The fuel is supplied through a 
Non Return Fuel Rail System. This system is 
used on the S54 for LEV compliancy. 

The fuel supply pressure is controlled by the 5 
Bar fuel pressure regulator integrated in the fuel 
filter assembly. The regulator is influenced by 
engine vacuum via a hose connected to the 
external air distribution pipe. The fuel exits the 
fuel pressure regulator supplying the fuel rail 
and the injectors. The E46 M 3 fuel filter assem¬ 
bly is located under the left front floor area (next 
to the frame rail). 

The fuel return line is located on the filter/regu¬ 
lator assembly which directs the unused fuel 
back to the fuel tank. The fuel tank hydrocar¬ 
bons are reduced by returning the fuel from this 
point instead of from the fuel rail. 

The 554 uses Bosch (4 hole plate)fuel injectors. 
The ECM controls the fuel injectors to regulate 
the air/fuel mixture.

Ignition Coils: The 554 uses "pencil type” igni¬ 
tion coils manufactured by Bremi. The six indi¬ 
vidual ignition coils are integrated with the spark 
plug connector (boot). 

The coils are removed by lifting the swivel latch 
connector retainer to release the wiring har¬ 
ness, apply a slight twist and lift the assembly 
upwards. 


NGK DCPR8EKP 

are used.

Clutch Assembly: The 554 clutch assembly is 
specially designed to transfer the high torque to 
the driveline and dampen vibrations throughout 
the rpm range. 

The clutch assembly consists of: 

Hydraulically Dampened Dual-Mass Flywheel 
Diaphragm Type Pressure Plate and Drive Disk 



Exhaust System: The US S54 uses two high 
performance stainless steel exhaust manifolds. 
The catalytic converters are integral with each 
exhaust manifold. 

Each exhaust manifold/catalyst contains a pre 
(1) and post (2) oxygen sensor. The sensors 
require a Special Tool (crescent wrench with 
swivel adapter) for removal. 

The E46 M3 exhaust system is a dual channel 
up to the muffler. By using the M-mobility kit, 
additional clearance is provided for the 40 liter 
half-shell muffler With four outlets. The M road¬ 
ster and M coupe have separate dual mufflers
