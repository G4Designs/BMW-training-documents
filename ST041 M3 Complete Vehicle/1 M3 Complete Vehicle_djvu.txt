Introduction 

The E46 M3 is the third generation of the M3 replacing the E36 M3. 

In comparison to its predecessor, the high engine performance and dynamic driving char¬ 
acteristics is expressed in its sport-oriented design. 

The E46 M3 is a high performance automobile which assumes the leading position in its 
class. 

The E46 M3 is a high performance coupe based on the new E46/2 body.

System Components 


The vehicle is fitted with an in-line 6-cylinder 3246 ccm engine (554B32) which is used 
worldwide. The 4-valve induction engine with high pressure VANOS outputs 333 bhp at 
7900 rpm. The maximum engine speed is 8000 rpm. The engine develops its maximum 
torque of 355 Nm at 4900 rpm. The engine management system is the MS S54. The drive 
train is reinforced to satisfy the engine’s increased horsepower and torque. 

The running gear of the E46/2 production vehicle and that of the E36 M3 form the basis of 
the E46 M3 running gear. In addition to the running gear which was specifically adapted to 
the M3, the vehicle also features: special wheels, Teves M K 20 dynamic drive control sys¬ 
tem, a variable locking M-differential and high performance brakes. 

The design of the E46 M3 makes it capable for everyday driving, economic operation, and 
high performance while meeting environmental requirements.

Vehicle Dimensions 

The overall length of the E46 M3 measures 4 mm longer than the E46 coupe (license plate 
bracket). 

Compared to the E46/2 production vehicle, the track width on the front and rearaxle of the 
E46 M3 have been increased considerably (track width: front axle +37 mm, rear axle 
+47mm). The new wider side panels enhance the sports character of the E46 M3.

E46 M3 Body 


Changes Compared to E46/2 

The increase in engine output, torque, dynamic driving characteristics and sport design of 
the E46 M3 places more demand requirements on the individual components in the body. 
Visual, functional as well as technical features of the E46 M3 body have been modified in 
order to satisfy all these requirements. The individual changes contribute to increasing the 
E46 M3 body rigidity. 

The visual differences of the E46 M3 as compared to the E46/2 in the body area include 
widening of the front and rear side panels, a modified aluminum hood as well as front and 
rear bumper covers. 

The increased body rigidity is achieved by the use of additional gusset plates and weld 
points. Both functional and technical modifications have been made to the side frame 
structures, front and rear wheel arches, reinforcement in the C-pillar area as well as the lug¬ 
gage compartment floor. 


The body of the E46 M3 corresponds to that of the E46/2 but with the following Changes: 


1. 

Floor Assembly / Luggage Compartment Floor 

2. 

Side Frame / Wheel Arches 

3.

Floor Assembly / Luggage Compartment Floor 


The basic structure ofthe E46 M3 floor assembly corresponds to thatofthe E46/2 but with 
3-specific modifications. 


The luggage compartment floor has been modified in orderto accommodate the largerrear 
silencer: The M-mobility system is mounted in a foam moulding in the luggage compart¬ 
ment floor. 


The retaining fixtures for the large volume rear silencer are located on the outer ends of the 
under body.

Side Frame/Wheel Arches 

Due to the larger tire sizes, the side frame structures of the E46 M3 are modified in the area 
of the wheel cutouts. The front and rear wheel arches have been modified forthe larger tire 
sizes and track widths. The inner side section has also been modified as compared to the 
E46/2. 

The C-pillararea features additional reinforcement. 

The hole pattern of the front spring strut towers and rear shock absorber mounts is the 
same as on the standard parts. 

Side Panels 

The design of the front and rear side panels lends the E46 a sport appearance. 

The front fenders have been formed corresponding to the tire sizes and track width. The 
fender side grill represents an M-GmbH development. 

The rear quarter panels have also been formed corresponding to the tire sizes and track 
width.

Hood 


The hood of the M3 is made of aluminum. The "powerdome” is an elevated section in the 
center of the hood which accents the sports-oriented character of the vehicle. The hood 
consists of the outer skin panel, an inner panel and the front inner panel. A reinforcement 
plate is integrated at the rear left and right for mounting the hinges. 

The gas struts for opening and closing the hood have been modified to the weight of the 
M3 hood. The hood latch is the same as that of the E46/2 production vehicle. 


Front Bumper 

The front bumper cladding is aerodynamically designed. 


The air inlets for brake cooling next to the fog lights are closed off. The a 
left fog light is used for engine air intake. 


let next to the

Rear Bumper 

The cladding forthe rear bumper is also modified with painted PDC sensors. The PDC set¬ 
ting has been modified due to the changed positions of the PDC sensors in the rear 
bumper. 



Fuel Filler Flap 

The fuel filler flap is new and has been modified to the shape of the rear quarter panel.

E46 M3 Sports Seats 


The M 3 is equipped with sport seats as standard equipment. The seat is manufactured by 
Lear. The E46/2 sport seats serve as the basis for the M3 sport seats. 

The sport seats are mechanical or electrical depending on the accessory package. 

For the first time, a variable side support is offered as an option. Air cushions fitted in the 
left and right side upholstery can be inflated or deflated to adapt to the body shape of the 
driver. 

In addition, a pneumatic lumbar support is fitted as in the E46/2.

Central Body Electronics 

The Body Electronic Systems of the E46 M3 are carried over from the E46 Coupe and 
Sedan models. The Driver Information System and Central Body Electronic System (ZKE V) 
continue to be used as the primary body electronic systems. 


The M 3 uses the "K"- Bus as the Primary communication link between body electronic con¬ 
trol modules. The "D" - Bus is used as the diagnostic interface from the diagnostic equip¬ 
ment to the instrument cluster. The "CAN” Bus is used as the communication link between 
all power train systems. Finally, the "M" - Bus is used for IH KA operation of the flap control 
stepper motors.

INSTRUMENTCLUSTER

E46 M3 Central Body Electronics 



































































































































Instrument Cluster 


The instrument cluster in the E46 M3 is similar to the cluster used in the coupes and it is 
the main source for information display. Information about the status of different operating 
systems in the vehicle is displayed through the gauges, LCD display, warning LEDs and 
Gong. Switches are also integrated in the instrument cluster to reset the trip mileage, per¬ 
form BC functions and to change over some units of measurement e.g. degrees F to 
degrees C. 


Additional to the E46 M3 Cluster is the use of an engine oil temperature gauge which 
replaces the fuel economy gauge below the tachometer. 

The tachometer incorporates the cold engine warning LEDs that were introduced with the 
E39 M 5. Starting at 4000 RP M, orange LEDs are illuminated with a cold engine start up. 
The LEDs will go out, in 500 RP M increments, as the engine warms up. The M S S54 engine 
control system monitors the engine oil temperature and signals the instrument cluster over 
the CAN line foroperation of the oil temperature gauge and illumination of the LEDs. 


Central Body Electronics (ZKE) 


The following functions are directly controlled by the General Module (GM V): 


Windshield wiping/washing with optional Rain Sensor Interface 

Central locking with power trunk release 

FZV Keyless Entry
