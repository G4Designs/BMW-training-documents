E46 M3 Running Gear 




E46 M3 Running Gear and Suspension 

Purpose of the System 

A requirement in the development of the running gear for the E46 M 3 was: "The running 
gear must be faster than the engine". The exceptional running gear and suspension of the 
E46/2 as well as the outstanding running gear of the M 3 predecessor served as the basis 
for the E46 M3. 

The combination of a very rigid 3 Series coupe body, lightweight aluminum axle compo¬ 
nents, 50/50 weight distribution and rear-wheel drive are ideal prerequisites for pure driving 
pleasure with the BMW E46 M3. 

The development objectives of E46 M3 were to further improve the sports car handling 
characteristics as compared to the predecessor while retaining the outstanding driveability 
for everyday use. 

In addition, by using the variable M-differential lock together with DSC III, it has been pos¬ 
sible to avoid the restrictions in winter operation normally associated with sports cars. 



System Components 


Front Axle: The front axle of the E46 M 3 is designed as a single-joint spring strut front axle. 
The basic characteristics of the axle resemble those of the M3 predecessor. 

The special feature of the E46 M 3 front axle is the rigid link of the running gear components 
to the body. 

The E46 M3 "specific" modified components are: 

Front axle mount 
Aluminum control arm frame 
Aluminum thrust zone 
Larger track width (1508 mm) 

Stabilizer bar 

Steering (track rod length changed) 

Steering knuckle 
Wheel bearings 
Front axle carrier 

Modified elastokinematics (rubber mounts and joints) 



Mount: The spring and damper are insulated 
from each other. This arrangement improves the 
feel of the road surface conditions through the 
steering wheel. 

Additional damping (rubber) has been inserted 
between the spring and damper mounting. 

The geometric layout (offset center) of the front 
axle mount makes it possible to increase the 
caster angle.

The offset mount center can be seen at the 
right. 

A locating bolt (arrow) can be removed and the 
upper mount bolt holes in the strut tower are 
slotted to allow the mount to be re-positioned 

for minimum camber adjustment 



Thrust Zone: The rigid connection of the sus¬ 
pension components to the body is further 
assisted by the transversely rigid thrust zone. 

The thrust zone is made of aluminum and is 
bolted to the control arm joints, front axle carri¬ 
er and the rear control arm mounts. 



Aluminum Control Arm: The forged aluminum 
control arm of the E46 M 3 front axle is a specif¬ 
ic development of BMW M . 

Compared to the control arm of the E36 M3, the 
weight has been reduced by 40%. Its design 
incorporates specific deformation characteris¬ 
tics.

Suspension and Damping: The spring rate of 
the front springs on the E46 M3 has been 
increased as compared to the E46/2. 

The shock absorbers are twin-tube gas pres¬ 
sure dampers. The connection of the stabilizer 
support is new. 


Stabilizer Bar: The front stabilizer bar is 26 mm 
in diameter. The stabilizer links have been 
adopted from the E46/2. 374 iooo 6 .tiff 



Wheel Carriers and Wheel Bearings: The 

wheel carriers on the M3 front axle are specific. 
The mount forthe brake caliper has been mod¬ 
ified compared to the E46/2. The wheel bear¬ 
ings have been modified for higher loads. A 
drive pin for the brake disc is located on the 
wheel hub. 


Steering: The steering on the M3 is designed 
as a power-assisted rack and pinion steering 
system. 

The steering pump produces a maximum pres¬ 
sure of 120 bar and has a deliver/ capacity of 
11 L/min. The total gear ratio is 15.4 : 1. The 
steering has no hydraulic limit stops. 

The turning circle is 11.0 m 
The track circle is 10.6 m 



The outer track rods of the rack and pinion 
steering are specific. They have been modified 
for the larger track width.

E46 M3 Rear Axle: The concept of the M3 rear axle originates from the E46/2. The char¬ 
acteristics of the central link axle has been adopted and modified from the E36 M3. 

The track width of 1525 mm was achieved by modifying the rear rim offset. 

The rear axle carrier was modified for accepting the differential and a modified rear stabiliz¬ 
er bar. 


The lowercontrol arm was adopted from the E46/2. To improve the wheel control, the outer 
joint is designed as a ball joint. 

The uppercontrol arm is aluminum. In order to improve the wheel control, the outer mount 
(as on the E36 M3) is designed as a ball joint. 


The Semi-trailing arm is specific, the mounts on the body have been adopted from the 
E46/2. The linkage points of the control arms have been modified to increase the driving 
stability of the rear axle. The wheel bearing are the same as the E36 M3.

Rear Axle Carrier with V-Strut:The rear axle 
carrier has been modified for the E46 M3. The 
rear body mounts have been specially modified 
to M3 requirements. 

The mounting points for the rear axle differential 
are new (2 rear, 1 front). The stabilizer bar 
mounting is new. 



The V-strut is bolted to the body and rear axle 
assembly for additional rear axle reinforcement. 


37410001.tiff 


A reinforcement plate (A) is integrated in the V- 
strut. The plate deflects airflow towards the rear 
axle differential cover. 


Suspension and Damping: The suspension 
and damping components have been tuned in 
line with sport characteristics. 



The coil (barrel) springs on the rear axle are pro¬ 
gressive rate. The tuning is M 3-specific. 

The shock absorbers are designed as twin tube 
gas pressure dampers. Compared to the E46/2, 
the diameter of the piston rod and the piston 
have been increased (piston 32mm, piston rod 
15mm). 

The auxiliary cushion on the rear axle shock 
absorber is new. It differs from the standard aux¬ 
iliary cushion by an additional groove and the 
black coloring. 


37410002.tiff 



Stabilizer Bar: The rear axle stabilizer bar is 
specific. The diameter is 21.5 mm. The mount¬ 
ing on the rear axle carrier has been modified for 
the E46 M3.

E46 Rear Axle Differential: The rear axle differential is developed specifically for the E46 
M3. The rear axle differential is designated "210" (ring gear diameter in mm). 

The mounting points of the rear axle carrier for the differential have been modified com¬ 
pared to the E46/2. 

The rear axle differential is bolted to the rear axle carrier at two mounting points on the rear 
axle differential casing. 


The rear axle carrier is connected to the body at the same points as the E46/2. For all BM W 
vehicles, this mounting arrangement is known as double-flexible rear axle mounting. 



The housing of the rear axle differential is E46 M3 specific. The cover of the rear axle dif¬ 
ferential is made of pressure die cast aluminum. Special arranged cooling fins reduce the 
temperature of the oil in the differential. 


The technical innovations of the variable M-differential lock developed by BMW M in coop¬ 
eration with GKN Viscodrive GmbH is fitted in the E46 M3.

Variable M-differential Lock 


To date, torque-sensing limited slip differentials with a constant basic locking torque have 
been used in M vehicles. The differential lock value for current M vehicles is 25%. However, 
if traction is very low, e.g. on snow, the advantages with this differential lock concept are 
limited due to the restricted support torque. 

A variable differential lock is used for the first time in the E46 M3. Compared to the con¬ 
ventional torque-sensing differential lock, the variable M-differential lock is capable of pro¬ 
viding traction advantages even under these extreme conditions. 

When there is a speed difference between both wheels, a shear pump located on the ring 
gear side generates a pressure. A working piston transmits this controlled pressure on the 
basis of the differential speed of the drive wheels to the multi-disc clutches so that the drive 
torque is transmitted to the wheel with the most "grip". 

The pump pressure and locking power increase as the speed difference between the two 
wheels increase. If the differential speed between both wheels decreases, the pump pres¬ 
sure is also reduced and the locking power diminishes. 

The Pump Unit: The pump unit is sealed (can¬ 
not be dismantled) and is filled with approx. 46 
grams of high viscosity silicone oil. 

As a result of the speed difference between the 
drive wheels, shear forces occur in the silicone 
oil in the pump unit between a channel filled with 
silicone oil and a pump disc located above it. 

These shear forces generate a pressure that is 
dependent on the differential speed of the drive 
pinions. 

The pressure is built up by a piston (max. 38 ■jj-—r ■ 
bar) that presses the multi-disc clutches togeth- 
er achieving a variable differential lock effect 1 
dependent on the differential speed. | —\—

Principle of Operation 

The conveyor belt model illustrates the functional principle of the shear pump. As the con¬ 
veyor belt moves, the viscous friction in the laterally sealed shear channel conveys the fluid 
in the direction of movement. 


Fluid Reservoir shear QhanneF 


Piston 



37410006.bmp 


By transferring the operation principle to a rotary system, the conveyor belt becomes a dis¬ 
placement disc driven by the Hub. The shear channel is then a circular groove in the con¬ 
trol disk. The control disk is located in the pump housing. 


Transfer ports that are connected to outlet holes 
in the pump housing are provided at the ends of 
the shear channel. 

Silicone oil is conveyed through the outlet holes 
from the equalization chamber (fluid reservoir) 
into the pressure chamber. Piston exerts a pres¬ 
sure on the friction discs. 

The arrows shown to the right represent the 
flow of silicone oil between the displacement 
disc and the control disc. The silicone oil is 
transferred from the reservoir on the outside of 
the pump housing to the pressure chamber 
between displacement discs and the piston. 

The arrangement of the pump elements and 
specific routing of the silicone oil in a gap 
between the piston and displacement disc 
ensures the pressure generated acts on the pis¬ 
ton.

E46 M3 Brakes: The E46 M3 is equipped with high 
performance brakes including floating calipers. 

Front brake discs: 

325 mm diameter 
28 mm thick 

Rear brake discs: 

328 mm diameter 
20 mm thick 



The tandem (dual circuit) brake master cylinder is 2- 
stage. 


The brake booster is a twin chamber (9710") vacuum 
assisted unit. 


E46 M3 Wheels and Tires: 18" high performance 
tires were specially developed for the E46 M3. 

The sizes are 225/45 ZR 18 on the front and 255/40 
ZR 18 on the rear. 

The newly styled 18" light alloy wheels for the E46 M 3 
are 8" wide on the front and 9" wide on the rear. 



36410000.tiff 


The extended hump (EH) of the wheels prevent the tire 
from slipping into the dropped center of the wheel in 
the event of pressure loss.

M-mobility System with RDW: The tire pressure warning 
system (RDW) is integrated in the Dynamic Stability Control 
(DSC III). 

It triggers a warning when the tire inflation pressure has a 
loss of approx. 50%. 

With the second generation M-mobility System (M MS), holes 
of up to 6 mm diameter can be sealed. 



Dynamic Stability Control: One of the aims in the development of the E46 M3 was to 
improve traction and winter driving characteristics. 

The E46 M3 uses the Teves M K 20 El DSC III system from the E46 production vehicle. 

With software adaptation and logic expansion, the system is tuned to the variable M-differ¬ 
ential lock.
