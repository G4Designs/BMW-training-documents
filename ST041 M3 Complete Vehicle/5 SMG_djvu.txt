Purpose of the System 


SMG II 

The SMG II combines the six-speed manual gearbox (S6S420G) of the E46 M3 with com¬ 
puter-controlled electrohydraulic clutch and gear change operation. The driver is provided 
with the accuracy of manual gear selection, the convenience of automated shifting and the 
speed and adaptability of driver-adjusted computer control. 

Using technology developed for the BMW/Williams Formula 1 car, the SMG II with DRIVE- 
LOGIC adapts the speed, accuracy and control of the race cars electrohydraulic shifting to 
the M3.

Basic Gearbox 



SMG II Manual Gearbox 45-01-03 


The standard basic gearbox (S6S420G), as used in the M3, is transformed into a sequen¬ 
tial gearbox with the addition of a hydraulic unit and shift assembly, a special clutch slave 
cylinder and a new shift-lever module. 


SMG II Control Unit 

The SMG II Control Unit, installed in the E-Box next to the DME, is a single board module 
with SKE (134 pin) gray colored connectors. The unit contains protection against reverse 
polarity and overvoltage. 

Communication with the DME is via a dedicated CAN bus (SMG II CAN Bus). Based on 
instructions received from the DME the SMG II control unit manages the clutch solenoid 
valve, the selector shaft up and down solenoids, and the selection angle solenoid. Safety 
functions and limp home capabilities are also part of the SMG II programming. 

While the SMG II control unit receives many of the inputs and manages the control of the 
hydraulic system, the DME is responsible for and controls all gearshifts. Sensor inputs 
received by the SMG II control unit are relayed to the DME for processing and monitoring.

SMG II Control Unit Inputs/Outputs 

SMG CAN Bus 

The SMG CAN Bus is the link for signal exchange between the DME and SMG II Control 
Unit. It allows the DME to issue command instructions for clutch and gearbox control as 
well as shift sequence and enables SMG II communication with the vehicle CAN BUS via 
the DME. 

Signals exchanged via 
Engine Speed 
Intake Air Temp 
Wheel Speed 
Cruise Status 
Brake Light Switch 

Engine Speed 

The engine speed signal is transmitted twice to the SMG II control unit. One signal arrives 
via the SMG CAN, the other arrives via a hard wire from the DME. 

Engine Coolant Temp 
Engine Oil Temp 
Intake Air Temp 

The signals are inputs directly into the DME and are shared with the SMG II control unit as 
the information is needed over the SMG II CAN. 

PWG 

The PWG signal is input into the DME and forwarded to the SMG II control unit. The infor¬ 
mation is used to calculate engine load. 

EDR Feedback Pots 

These potentiometers provide throttle position information that is useful during slip inter¬ 
vention. 

Wheel Speed 

Conditioned digital wheel speed information is received from the DSC control unit. The 
SMG II control unit uses data from all 4 wheels to detect vehicle speed and wheel slip in 
the A-Mode and during down shifts in all modes to detect drag torque induced wheel slip. 

Transverse Acceleration 

Transverse Acceleration data is transferred from the DSC control unit in the A-Mode so that 
up and down shifts may be prevented during high speed cornering. This sensor informa¬ 
tion is further evaluated for slip recognition purposes.

Steering Angle 

This data from the steering angle sensor is sent via the CAN Bus for cornering and slip con¬ 
trol information. 

Cruise Status 

The cruise mode is deactivated when a driver initiated shift is made in the S-Mode, during 
A-Mode operation, the cruise control setting is maintained. 

Parking Brake 

Information concerning parking brake application affects gear engagement and vehicle 
operation. 

Door Contacts 

The hall effect door position sensors integrated into the door latch mechanism signal the 
GM. This data is transferred via the K-Bus and CAN Bus for safety program initiation. 

Brake Light Switch 

Brake pedal status is transferred to the SMG II control unit via the DME. The signal is used 
for: 

Unlocking the shift lock Brake detection Engine Starting 

Downhill detection Clutch Disengagement while stopped. 

Key Memory 

At this time no functions for Car or Key Memory are provided for SMG II 

SMG II Control Unit Inputs 

MFL 

Upshift and downshift signals from the paddle switches located on the steering wheel. 
Shift lever 

Located in the shift lever module, 8 hall sensors detect upshift and downshift requests and 
are also used for Selector Lever position indication (Forward, Reverse and Neutral). Signals 
from the hall sensors are also used to initiate mode changes from S-Mode to A-Mode and 
back. 

DRIVELOGIC 

The shift characteristics are activated by means of the switch located on the console just 
to the rear of the shift lever. 

Longitudinal Acceleration 

The signals from the Longitudinal Acceleration Sensor which is mounted under the pas¬ 
senger seat are used for uphill driving programs.

SMG II 



General Module 

Load deactivation information (Sleep) is received by the SMG II Control Unit. 


Clutch Position 

Input from the PLCD providing exact clutch position. 

Shift Position 

The Position sensor provides two inputs (PS2 and PS3, each a dual pot) for position recog¬ 
nition of the main selector shaft in the transmission. 

Gearbox RPM 

A hall sensor is used to measure transmission input shaft speed. 

Hydraulic Pressure 

A Pressure transducer for monitoring hydraulic pressure sends pressure information to the 
SMG II Control Unit. 

Temperature Sensors 

Two NTC sensors are used for measuring Gearbox oil temperature and hydraulic fluid 
temperature. 

Hood Contacts 

Two Micro switches located in the hood latch mechanism provide a ground signal to the 
SMG II Control Unit when the hood is closed. 

Engine Speed 

Calculated engine speed received from DME via hardwire serves as redundant information 
with that received via the SMG CAN Bus. 

SMG II Control Unit Outputs 

Shift Lock Mechanism 

The Shift Lock Mechanism locks the shift lever in position for parking and prevents 
unintended gear changes as part of the safety programming. 

EWS 

During the start-up operation, the SMG II Control Unit confirms shift lever position (0) and 
brake application and signals the EWS module which then allows starter engagement. 

Hydraulic Unit 

The Hydraulic Unit is energized through a relay controlled by the SMG II Control Unit. The 
operation of four (4) solenoid valves located in the hydraulic unit that are used to actuate 
the clutch and shift the transmission are also controlled by the SMG II.

Hydraulic Pump 

The Hydraulic Pump, installed in the Hydraulic unit, generates the pressure required to 
operate the clutch and perform gear changes. 

The pump is a piston pump driven by an electric motor, actuated by the SMG control unit 
via a relay so that oil pressure is always between 45 and 80 bar. Power consumption of the 
electric motor is 20 amps. 

When the fluid pressure in the hydraulic unit drops below 45 bar, the SMG II control unit 
activates the relay and supplies the electric motor with B+. At a hydraulic pressure of 80 
bar, the SMG II control unit deactivates the relay. 

To ensure there is sufficient pressure when the engine is started, the hydraulic pump is acti¬ 
vated below an accumulator pressure of 45 bar when the door is opened or the vehicle is 
unlocked with the key or the remote. 

In the event of a hydraulic system failure the gearbox warning lamp is turned on in the IKE 
and if hydraulic pressure fails to build, no further gearshifts are allowed. This allows the 
reserve pressure in the accumulator to be used to place the gearbox in the Neutral position 
when the vehicle comes to a stop. 

Pressure Accumulator and Non-Return Valve 

The Pressure Accumulator in the hydraulic unit ensures that pressure generated by the 
pump is stored in the system for a certain amount of time. The accumulator is divided into 
two chambers by a piston, with nitrogen at 39 bar filling one chamber and fluid delivered 
by the hydraulic pump filling the other chamber. The volume of the accumulator is 150ccm. 
The Non-Return Valve at the pump outlet prevents the hydraulic oil pressure from dropping 
when the pump is not running. 

Pressure Relief Valve 

The Pressure Relief Valve opens if the hydraulic oil pressure reaches 100 bar, creating a cir¬ 
cuit between the suction and pressure sides of the pump, thus preventing further increase 
in pressure. 

Hydraulic Oil Pressure Sensor 

Mounted on the hydraulic unit the Oil Pressure Sensor informs the SMG II control unit of the 
current hydraulic pressure. At 0 bar pressure a voltage signal of .5 volts is sent to the SMG 
II with the voltage increasing linearly to 4.58 volts at 100 bar of pressure. 

Failure of the pressure sensor whether shorted or open will result in the hydraulic unit being 
activated for a fixed amount of time at predetermined intervals and after each gearshift to 
maintain system pressure. 

Hydraulic Oil Temperature Sensor 

Temperature of the hydraulic oil is monitored by the SMG II control unit via a NTC temper¬ 
ature sensor located in the hydraulic unit.

Hydraulic Fluid Expansion Tank Quick Release 
Coupling. 


The Hydraulic Fluid Expansion Tank is mounted on the rear of the intake manifold and con¬ 
nected to the hydraulic unit via a plastic supply hose with a quick release coupling. A valve 
in the tank prevents oil loss when the supply hose is disconnected. 

Solenoid Valves 

Four solenoid valves are installed in the hydraulic unit. Two of the solenoid valves are 
designed as proportional directional valves (1 - for clutch control and 1 - for selection angle 
cylinder actuation). The other two solenoid valves are pressure control valves (both used for 
shift travel cylinder actuation).

Proportional Directional Valves 

The two proportional directional valves have three positions: pressure reduction, pressure 
holding, pressure increase. 



Proportional Directional Control Valve 


1. Pressure Reduction 

2. Pressure Holding 

3. Pressure Increase 


The proportional directional valves are set in the pressure reduction position when there is 
no gear shifting or clutch operation in progress. In this condition the two cylinders (clutch 
cylinder and selector angle cylinder) are connected to the expansion tank. 

During clutch operation or main selector shaft rotation the valve is placed in the pressure 
increase position. In this position the valve connects the cylinder to the hydraulic pressure 
accumulator. At this stage the solenoid will consume approximately 1.1-2 amps. The valve 
is fully open up to 2 amps. 

When the clutch is to be disengaged or the main selector shaft is to remain in the activat¬ 
ed position, the valve switches to the pressure holding position. With the valve in this posi¬ 
tion the flow of hydraulic oil to the cylinder is interrupted and the piston of the activated 
cylinder remains in a pressurized mode. 

Pressure Control Valve 

The piston in the shift travel cylinder must be moved in both directions (in/out) by pressure. 
Two pressure control valves are required to achieve this movement. 

With no current applied to the valves they are in the open position allowing connection of 
the cylinder chamber and the expansion tank. Applying current to one of the solenoids will 
cause hydraulic fluid to flow against the cylinder piston pushing it in one direction. Fluid from 
the other side of the piston will be forced through the second control valve into the expan¬ 
sion tank.

Gear Actuation 


When no gear is engaged the selector shaft is the the neutral position in the shift gate 
between 5th and 6th gears. The piston in the selection angle cylinder (B) is pushed against 
the stop by a spring. The shift travel cylinder is in the central position in cylinder C (pres¬ 
sure is equal on both sides). 

With the selection of 1 st gear, the piston in the selection angle cylinder (B) is charged with 
hydraulic fluid (Pressure increasing mode). The SMG II control unit is informed by the posi¬ 
tion sensor (PS2) when the piston and consequently the main selector shaft (MSS) has 
reached the point in the shift gate between 1st and 2nd gears. The piston is the selection 
angle cylinder is placed in the the pressure holding mode to maintain MSS position. 

Shift Travel cylinder (C) is now activated via the control valves . One side of the piston in the 
cylinder is supplied with hydraulic fluid under pressure, the other side of the piston cham¬ 
ber is open to the expansion tank. The piston and with it the MSS is pushed in the appro¬ 
priate position and a gear is engaged (Either 1st or 2nd). A redirection of fluid on the shift 
travel cylinder piston will cause the other gear to be engaged.

Shift Lever 

Hall effect sensors are mounted in the Shift Lever Module to detect position and movement 
of the shift lever. A total of 8 hall sensors are used in the shift lever module with 4 sensors 
dedicated to +/- gear change requests and mode changes requests (A to S mode). 

Two sensors are used for detection of the reverse gear position and two for detection of the 
neutral shift lever position. 

The following shift lever positions are possible: 

• Reverse (R) 

• Idle-Speed (0) (Neutral) 

• Forward/Sequential Mode (S-Mode) 

• Change positions 
+ for Upshifts 

- for Downshifts 

• Mode Change (A/S Modes) 

A spring loaded mechanism holds the shift lever in the forward, idle-speed and reverse 
positions.

SMG II Shift Lever Module 


Upshifts and downshifts are made by moving the shift lever in the up or down direction from 
the spring latched forward position. Moving the shift lever back shifts the transmission up 
one gear, moving the lever forward shifts the transmission down one gear. The shift lever 
must be returned to the middle position to engage another upshift or downshift. 

Moving the shift lever to the right while in the forward position changes the shift modes from 
A-Mode to S-Mode and back again. 


Programming in the SMG II control unit will prevent impermissible downshift requests. 



19 

SMG II 






Shift Lock 

The shift lock prevents unintended gear changes. 

For safety reasons the brake pedal must be depressed before the shift lock is disengaged, 
allowing gear selection. Once a gear (either R or 1) has been engaged, shifting between R 
and 1 can be accomplished without stepping on the brake pedal for a time period of 2 sec¬ 
onds. When 2 seconds has elapsed, the shift lock will engage preventing shifting between 
R and 1 unless the brake pedal is depressed again. 

The shift lock is energized in the unlocked position and rests in the lock position. 

Steering Wheel Paddle Switches 



SMG Steering Mounted Paddle Switches 

+ Request upshift 
- Request downshift 


The Steering Wheel Paddles Switches are hardwired to the SMG II control unit and are used 
to request upshift and downshifts. Pulling on the right side paddle will request the SMG II 
control to make a shift to a higher gear. Pulling the left side paddle request a shift to a lower 
gear. 

Both paddles provide a momentary switched ground signal to the SMG II control unit. 

DRIVELOGIC Control 

The DRIVELOGIC Control makes it possible for the driver to adapt the gearshift character¬ 
istics of the transmission to his own individual style with each driving mode (A-Mode, S- 
Mode). 

The DRIVELOGIC Control Button is located on the center console just to the rear of the 
shifter. The button provides two inputs to the SMG II control unit. Both inputs are momen¬ 
tary switched grounds, one for program mode up and one for program mode down. 
DRIVELOGIC Control provides selection of 5 programs in the A-Mode and 6 programs in 
the S-Mode. The individual programs differ as follows: 

• A-Mode 

There are 5 automated gearshift programs from A1 (Winter mode, vehicle starts off in 
2nd gear) to A5 (Sport mode, a highly dynamic program). 



SMG II 




• S-Mode 

There are 6 different sequential gearshift programs from SI (Slow, relaxed shifts with 
soft clutch engagement) to S6 (Very fast shifts with quick clutch engagement, only 
accessible with DSC turned off).

Shift Lights 

In S-Mode optimum shift points are indicated by LED’s integrated into the tachometer. As 
the tachometer approaches redline a sequence of LED’s illuminate on the face of the 
gauge. As the tach reaches the optimal shift point the final LED illuminates; this red LED 
indicates the optimal shift point.

DSC Control Unit 

Data concerning transverse acceleration and wheel speed (all 4 wheel speed sensors) is 
relayed to the SMG II control unit via the MS S54 control unit. 

Unless specifically switched off Dynamic Stability Control remains in operation during all 
modes in A-Mode and in all S-Modes except program S6. 

Regardless of the last setting, DSC is automatically activated whenever the car is started. 

SAC Clutch 

The SMG II operates with the SAC clutch used in the S54B32 manual gearbox. 

The pressure force of the pressure plate over the driving disc onto the flywheel remains the 
same over the clutch's entire operating time. 

The release force is likewise the same over the operating time.The shift quality in the SMG 
II thus remains the same.

Principle of Operation 


Engine Starting 

Unlocking the car or opening the drivers door wakes up the GM which sends a wake up 
call to the SMG II control unit. Awoken the SMG II looks at hydraulic pressure stored in the 
accumulator. Pressure greater than 45 causes the SMG II to wait for starting initiation. 
Hydraulic pressure under 45 bar, causes the SMG II to energize the hydraulic pump relay, 
powering up the pump to build system pressure in anticipation of a start sequence. 

Engine starting is only possible when the shift lever is in the 0 (idle-speed or neutral) posi¬ 
tion and the brake pedal is depressed. If a gear is selected before the key is turned to the 
start position of if the vehicle has been parked in gear, the shift lever must first be moved 
to the 0 position and the brake depressed. 

Responsibility for starter operation remains with the EWS module. As the key is turned to 
the KL50 position, the EWS module waits for confirmation from the SMG II control unit that 
the shift lever position is 0 and that the brake pedal is depressed. The SMG II control unit 
is notified of KL50 and brake pedal position via the SMG CAN Bus by the MS S54. Receipt 
of notification of KL50 causes the SMG II control module to check shift lever and brake 
pedal position. Seeing shift lever position 0 and the brake pedal depressed, the SMG II 
momentarily supplies a switched ground signal to the EWS module to serve as a release to 
allow starter engagement. Upon receiving these confirmations the EWS module activates 
the starter. 

The clutch is open (not engaged) during start-up operation. 

Engaging A Gear 


Once the engine is running the driver is able to engage the gear selection of choice through 

the shift lever.

Input from the hall effect switches in the gear shift lever is sent to the SMG II control unit. 
Status of the hood and brake pedal input is checked and the SMG II control unit looks at 
vehicle speed, engine speed, hand brake status and door position. With first gear request¬ 
ed and status of the inputs correct, the selection angle piston is pressurized until the main 
selector shaft reaches the shift gate between 1 st and 2nd gears as indicated by the posi¬ 
tion sensor in the gearbox actuator assembly. The selection angle piston is then placed in 
pressure holding position and the shift travel cylinder is pressurized on one side by opera¬ 
tion of the two shift valves in the hydraulic unit causing it to push the main selector shaft in 
the appropriate direction, engaging 1st gear.

into proper plane, then shift travel cylinder 
pushes the Main Selector Shaft in the prop¬ 
er direction to engage a gear.

First Gear Engaged 


Engagement of the gear via the shift travel cylinder takes place in three phases with differ¬ 
ing pressures. 

• Phase 1 is the distance which must be covered from the central position of the shift gate 
to the synchronization point with the gear to be engaged occurs. 

• Phase 2 is the engagement of the synchronizers. 

• Phase 3 is the distance that the shifting sleeve must travel after engaging the synchro¬ 
mesh mechanism before passing over the teeth of the gear wheel. 

In three phases, varying pressures applied to the piston to ensure that the gear shift takes 
place with maximum comfort under minimal material load conditions and minimal wear. 

Pressure is now relieved on the selection angle piston and a spring in the selection angle 
cylinder forces the piston back until the main selector shift contacts the flank of the 1 st gear 
gate. The transmission is now firmly in 1 st gear. 



SMG II 






The number 1 is lighted in the shift display as communicated by the SMG II control unit to 
the DME and further passed on to the IKE via the CAN Bus. The SMG II control unit then 
looks at hood status and if closed allows clutch engagement. Hydraulic pressure to the 
clutch slave cylinder is controlled by a PWM signal to the Hydraulic Unit and based on 
engine speed, engine load, temperature, door contacts and inputs from the DSC. 

Upshifts and Downshifts 

The mechanical procedure for shifting whether up or down remains the same. The follow¬ 
ing sequence occurs during an upshift from 1st to 2nd. 

• The selector angle cylinder is pressurized moving the MSS to an “unlocked” position in 
1 st gear. When the “unlocked” position is recognized by the Position Sensor, the selec¬ 
tor angle cylinder is placed in the pressure holding mode. 

• Pressure is applied to one side of the shift travel cylinder, causing the MSS shaft to 
move across the neutral gate into 2nd gear. 

• 2nd Gear is engaged and the pressure on the selector angle cylinder is released, “lock¬ 
ing” the transmission in 2nd gear. 

All the upshifts and downshifts are made dependent on programming and mode selection.

Transmission is shifted from 1st to 2nd gear. 



The forces required for shifting are strongly dependent on gearbox-fluid temperature. The 
fluid pressures acting on the pistons of the two shift cylinders are adapted according to fluid 
temperature. 



SMG II 






Shifting Operation 

Depending on the driving situation, distinctions are made between trailing-throttle upshifts, 
trailing-throttle downshifts, acceleration upshifts and acceleration downshifts. The com¬ 
plete shifting operation takes place in 3 phases. 

• Clutch disengagement 

The DME calculates engine torque in anticipation of a gear change. When a gear 
change is initiated, the speed at which the clutch is disengaged is based on this 
calculation. Engine torque (and rpm) is reduced as the clutch is being disengaged 
until a predetermined set point is reached where engine torque and clutch torque 
are approximately equal. The selector angle cylinder has begun to pressurize and the 
MSS reaches the neutral or “unlocked” position while still in gear. At this point the shift 
begins. 

• Shift to Target Gear 

The quickness of the gearshift is defined by the SMG II control unit and influenced 
by the DME. Engine RPM drops off rapidly during the shift but engine torque remains 
relatively flat. When clutch disengagement confirmation is received by the SMG II 
the shift travel cylinder is pressurized on one side forcing the MSS into the neutral 
position in the gate (i.e. between first and second gears). Additional pressure is added 
causing the synchronization of the next gear and finally the MSS is driven to fully engage 
the gear. The pressure is then relieved from the selector angle cylinder. 

• Clutch Engagement 

As soon as the target gear has been engaged fully the clutch begins to move at a speed 
determined beforehand by the DME. Engine RPM and torque begin to increase. The 
objective of the programming is to configure the meeting point of the engine and clutch 
torques as smoothly as possible by the engine management system. 

Driving and Shift Programs 

There are two drive programs for the SMG II: A-Mode for automated shifting and S-Mode 
for sequential shifting. Furthermore, the driver can use a DRIVELOGIC control in A/S mode 
to match the shift point characteristics as closely as possible to his driving style. For this 
purpose, 5 programs in A mode and 6 programs in S mode can be selected respectively. 
The individual programs differ as follows: 

• A-Mode, automated 

There are five different automated shift programs, from A1 (pulling away in 2nd gear) to 
A5 (sporty). 

• S-Mode, sequential 

There are six different sequential shift programs, from SI (relaxed dynamic) to S5 (sporty) 
and, as a special function, S6 (super sporty). 



SMG II 



In S mode, the 6th program can only be activated if the DSC function has been deactivat¬ 
ed beforehand. The 6th program becomes active when the DRIVELOGIC control is oper¬ 
ated. 

Only in this program is it possible also to activate the acceleration boost. This ensures that 
the BMW E46 M3 receives the optimum propulsion. Naturally this places the highest load 
on the vehicle components affected and so increases wear. 

The driver is shown which mode and which program has been selected by the SMG II dis¬ 
play unit in the instrument cluster.

SMG II Display in Instrument Cluster 


A Mode 

• Shift programs A1 to A5 

If the driver has selected A mode using the selector lever, gearchanges are automated 
according to the road speed, the position of the accelerator pedal and the DRIVELOGIC 
control in the center console. 

A mode is cancelled if the driver pulls one of the two shift switches on the steering wheel, 
moves the selector lever towards -/+ or activates S mode by briefly pressing the selector 
lever to the right. 

Five shift programs (A1-A5) are available to the driver in A mode. The software for the five 
automated mode shift programs is stored in the SMG II control unit. The car drives in the 
winter driving program (A1) up to the sporty highly-dynamic program (A5). 

Functions are also included to detect ambient conditions automatically and to influence the 
optimum gearselection.

SMG II 



A1 program (winter driving program) 

On road surfaces with a low coefficient of friction, e.g. snow or black ice, it is possible to 
start off in 2nd gear by selecting the A1 program. 

Upshift/downshift suppression 

When driving, the driver may be forced to adapt the car's speed repeatedly to the flow of 
traffic by heavy braking and acceleration according to the traffic situation. 

The rapid release of the accelerator pedal and rapid acceleration are detected by the SMG 
II control unit. If this exchange sequence takes place in short time intervals, the gearbox 
suppresses upshifting when the accelerator pedal is released and downshifting when it is 
depressed. 

Upshifts to the economical gear only take place once the accelerator pedal has remained 
in the same position for a brief period. 

Cornering 

If the accelerator pedal is rapidly released before the car corners, an upshift does not take 
place, nor does an upshift take place while the car is cornering. 

If an upshift were to occur while the car was cornering, the braking effect of the engine 
would be reduced or cancelled entirely, which in turn could reduce the car's rate of decel¬ 
eration and it would be necessary to change back down to improve acceleration to accel¬ 
erate out of the corner. 

Cornering is detected by the SMG II control unit by means of the DSC lateral acceleration 
and steering angle detection. 

Uphill-driving detection 

Compared with driving on a level surface, tractive resistance during uphill driving increases 
by the component of the downgrade force. This requires increased engine power to main¬ 
tain a constant speed. Increased engine power is achieved by having the throttle open at 
a slightly later stage. A downshift to a lower gear occurs to increase the engine speed 
depending on the road speed. 

Assuming that the speed is to be kept constant, the throttle valve angle must now be 
reduced, which in turn would result in an upshift. The result would be damaging back-and- 
forth shifting if the gradient were to be negotiated at a constant speed. 

Characteristic maps are stored in the control unit's software to suppress shifting of this 
type. The characteristic maps suppress back-and-forth shifting and provide the engine with 
the optimum traction force. 



SMG II 



Downhill-driving detection 

The rule of thumb that the same gear should be used for descending a gradient as for 
ascending the same gradient still applies. 

This ensures that the engine's braking effect is exploited. The driver does not have to 
depress the brake pedal as frequently. This represents a clear improvement in comfort and 
takes the strain off the service brake. 

This is made possible by the implementation of a downhill-driving detection function in the 
form of software. The control unit identifies that the vehicle speed is increasing in spite of 
overrun conditions and infers a downhill-driving scenario. 

The logic circuit in the control unit begins by preventing a shift to the gear one higher. 
Nevertheless, if the vehicle speed increases in such a way that braking is required, a down¬ 
shift takes place automatically to the gear one lower. This procedure can be repeated as 
many times until 1st gear is engaged. 

The required data for downhill-driving detection are engine load, vehicle speed, longitudinal 
acceleration and service-brake condition. 

Braking retardation 

Because of the nature of an automatic transmission, releasing the accelerator pedal at 
medium or high driving speed results in an upshift. If the vehicle is then accelerated again, 
the accelerating performance is insufficient or a downshift must take place with more 
marked acceleration. In order to prevent this behavior, the braking-retardation signal is 
directed to the control unit. 

Depending on the extent of braking retardation, a downshift to a lower gear is executed 
during the braking procedure. This ensures that the appropriate gear is engaged when the 
driver stops braking and starts accelerating.

S mode, sequential 

Shift programs SI to S5 

The selector lever or the shift paddles on the motorsport multifunction steering wheel can 
be used to change gear in sequential mode (S mode). In principle all shift operations are 
executed. 

There is no forced upshift when the maximum engine speed is reached. The driver is 
reminded visually by LEDs (shift lights) in the instrument cluster to make the necessary 
gearchange at full load before the engine's limit speed is reached. 

It is possible to shift through several gears by multiple-touch operation. Gearshifting in the 
gearbox does not always have to take place sequentially. The driver can skip a gear by 
shifting very quickly. 

If the driver changes down twice in rapid succession before the gearchange for the first shift 
command has time to complete, the gearchange is prevented in the gearbox and the gear 
selected by the second shift command is selected. 

Downshifts which would cause the maximum engine speed to be exceeded are refused. If 
the driver forgets to change down as the car's speed decreases, a downshift is executed 
automatically when the road speed falls below a gear-dependent threshold stored in the 
control unit. This ensures perfect vehicle acceleration when the accelerator pedal is 
depressed. 

Hill-climbing assistance 

The SMG II is equipped with special software in order to facilitate driving off on an incline. 
On an ascending road, the vehicle would roll back when the brake pedal is released. 

The driver can activate this function by pulling the shift switch (-) on the multifunction steer¬ 
ing wheel for a period of 0.5 seconds while the vehicle is stationary and with the brake 
pedal pressed. The engine speed is increased in line with the gradient. When the brake is 
released, the clutch is moved to the biting point and so the car is held momentarily at the 
point of rolling back on an uphill gradient. 

When the accelerator pedal is depressed, the clutch opens and the vehicle moves off in 1 st 
gear. If the accelerator pedal is not pressed, the clutch opens again (after approx. 2 sec¬ 
onds) and the vehicle may roll back. 

Note: 

This mode is not for extended use. Vehicle will be held only for 2 seconds. 
Holding vehicle on upgrade by holding slight pressure on accelerator pedal 
applies clutch. 

Doing so will cause excessive wear on clutch and lead to failure. 

32 


SMG II 



Acceleration boost (S6) 

To activate the acceleration boost, it is necessary for the DSC to be deactivated and the S6 
shift program to be active. Only with this setting is it possible to perform a "racing start". 

The shift lever must now be pushed forwards and the accelerator pedal depressed. The 
acceleration boost is performed once the shift lever has been released. Subsequent gear 
shifts must be initiated manually. 

There are two modes included in the acceleration boost S6 position. The “racing start” and 
the “burnout” modes. The difference in the activation of these two modes is the rate at 
which the accelerator pedal is depressed. 

Depressing the accelerator slowly to the floor activates the “racing start” mode. In this 
mode the clutch is pulsated at a high rate (up to 8 times a second) and the vehicle accel¬ 
erates at the fastest speed possible without spinning the tires. The wheel speeds on the 
front and rear axles are compared with each other and the car pulls away according to the 
clutch biting point in order to achieve optimum propulsion. 

Depressing the accelerator pedal very quickly to the floor activates “burnout” mode. This 
mode releases the clutch totally and completely when the shift lever is released. In this 
mode the rear tires are very likely to loose traction and the rear of the car to become unsta¬ 
ble. Wheel speeds are ignored and the driver is in total control of wheel spin. 

Note: 

Both acceleration boost modes are hard on the clutch and driveline and continued use of 
these modes (particularly the “burnout” mode) may lead to clutch or driveline failure.

SMG II Shift Programs 




Other Shift Functions 


Slip Alert System 

Under Slippery or inclement situations the SMG II can alter the clutch engagement and 
engine RPM to ensure the rear wheels never break traction. Functional in either sequential 
or automated mode, Slip Alert checks for tire slippage every 10 ms and also operates even 
with the DSC turned off. 

Double Declutching 

To prevent a fast downshift from upsetting the M3’s composure in any way, the SMG II will 
automatically double clutch and raise engine speed on downshifts to guarantee that engine 
RPM and road speed are perfectly matched before the lower gear engages. The result is 
quicker, smoother downshifts with less wear on the clutch and less chance of upsetting the 
car’s chassis. 

Changing gears without altering the position of the accelerator pedal 

The driver is not required to take his foot off the accelerator pedal during the shifting oper¬ 
ation. This applies to both automatic and manual mode. The engine management system 
determines when a gearchange is necessary. All engine interventions, such as ignition tim¬ 
ing intervention, cylinder fade-out and throttle adjustment are carried out automatically by 
the MS S54. 

If an upshift to the gear one higher takes place, the engine speed must be lower after the 
shift operation. The speed is set by the ignition or the throttle. 

If a downshift to the gear one lower takes place, the engine speed must be higher after 
completion of the shift operation. The speed is increased by means of a corresponding 
opening of the throttle. 

Safety Functions 

It is not necessary to disengage the gear to stop the car, regardless of whether the car is 
being driven in A mode or S mode. 

If the SMG II control unit detects that the selector lever is in the idle-speed position and the 
engine speed is lower than the threshold set for a particular temperature, the clutch is auto¬ 
matically disengaged to prevent the engine from stalling. 

If the driver takes no action, such as opening the driver's door or depressing the brake 
pedal, within a certain time of the car reaching a standstill with the engine running and a 
gear engaged, the gearbox is shifted to neutral. The last active gear is engaged once an 
appropriate action has been made. 

If the driver's door is opened while the vehicle is at a standstill with the engine running and 
a driving position selected, the gear is disengaged after a preset time threshold if no action 
is taken within this time at the accelerator or brake pedal. 



SMG II 



In this situation, the driver will be warned after a preset time by the gear indicator flashing 
and an acoustic signal of the need to disengage the gear. The warning remains, even after 
the gear has been disengaged. Regardless of the safety function, the shift display always 
flashes while the engine is running and the driver's door is open. 

The safety function is terminated as soon as the selector lever is moved to the 0 position. 

Hood Open 

If the hood is opened while the car is at a standstill with the engine running and a gear 
engaged, or if the car's condition is unclear due to a system fault, the gear is disengaged. 
It is not possible to pull away and the gear indicator flashes when the hood is open, regard¬ 
less of the safety function. 

Shift Lock 

A shift lock prevents an unintended gearchange. 

It is possible to to only engage a gear with the brake applied, except that when shifting from 
Reverse to 1 st or 1 st to Reverse, shifting may be accomplished if the car is not moving for 
a time period of approximately 2 seconds. 

The two seconds enable a rapid shift from position "R" to a forwards gear via position "0" 
without having to depress the footbrake. 

The shift lock is activated by a magnet, which locks the selector lever at zero current in the 
"0" position. 

Engine shutoff 

If the key is turned to position 1 or 0 in the ignition while the selector lever is in the forwards 
or reverse position, a gear automatically remains engaged. 

If the key is turned to position 1 or 0 in the ignition while the selector lever is in idle-speed 
position 0, a gong sounds and the gear indicator flashes in the SMG display as a reminder 
that the car has not been secured against rolling away. 

The warning is silenced after approximately 10 seconds. If the selector lever is moved to 
the forwards or reverse position during this time, a gear is engaged automatically. 


Emergency Acceleration 

Emergency Acceleration is possible regardless of the shift mode (A-Mode or S-Mode) or 
the DRIVELOGIC position engaged. 

Depressing the accelerator pedal quickly to the floor without the brake pedal depressed will 
engage emergency acceleration. The engine RPM will come up very quickly and the clutch 
will be pulsated to ensure maximum acceleration. Wheel spin will be limited even if DSC is 
switched off. 

When this mode is activated subsequent shifts must be made manually.

SMG II 



SMG II Diagnosis 

The SMG II control unit is fully diagnosable and can be checked using a DISplus Tester or 
GT1. 

The first step involves the fault memory being read out. Malfunctions are communicated as 
part of the SMG II control unit's self-diagnosis. The second step involves appropriate oper¬ 
ator prompting to facilitate diagnosis with simple measuring equipment using test modules. 
Repairs can be made once the fault in question has been found. 

The diagnosis including self-diagnosis can only be carried out when the ignition (terminal 
15) is switched on and there is a supply voltage of at least 10 volts. Erroneous fault entries 
may be recorded if the supply voltage drops below the threshold of approx. 10 volts. 

Service functions 

A test program (service functions) must be carried out upon completion of various types of 
work on the SMG system - see the following table. The test programs serve to implement 
test, initialize and adjustment functions. 

The values determined are permanently stored in the non-volatile memory only after the test 
program has been success-fully completed.
