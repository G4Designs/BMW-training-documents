G12 Rear Seat Entertainment 

1. Introduction 

1.1. History 

There were a number of innovations in terms of equipment and operation in the rear seat 
entertainment system for the F01/F02. 2 different equipment specifications were available: 

The Rear Seat Entertainment (SA 6FG) and the Rear Seat Entertainment Professional (SA 6FH). 

Two folding displays with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels and a screen size of 8“ (SA 6FG) or 
9.2“ (SA 6FH) with integrated infrared transmitter unit for wireless headphones were used in 
a BMW vehicle for the first time. 

The infrared transmitter unit for the headphones was replaced by 2 radio interfaces for connection 
of 2 wireless headphones (KLEER® standard) with the F01/F02 LCI in July 2012. 

The system is controlled by a radio remote control or, in the case of the High system, via the rear- 
compartment controller FCON. 

RSE control units were integrated in the MOST bus for both systems. 

Innovations for the F01/F02 included the following: 

• Independent operation of driver's and passenger's sides with rear seat entertainment system. 

• Navigation in 2D and 3D with navigation transfer of destination input to the driver. 

Route guidance started after acceptance of the suggestion by the driver. 

• BMW Online and BMW Internet implemented as optional equipment in the RSE system. 

• Use of the Gracenote© database with data from the Head Unit High. 

• USB interface in the control unit of the RSE system available for customer use with audio and 
video playback from USB stick. 

• A zoning concept has been implemented since 07/2012. The concept provides a clear 
structure for media operation in the vehicle. There are sources which can be accessed only 
at the front in the head unit, sources which can be accessed only in the rear in the RSE and 
sources that can accessed by both operating units (common media server, broadcast, etc.).

1.2.1. Offer 

With the introduction of the G12, only one rear seat entertainment system is now offered, the Rear 
Seat Entertainment (SA6FR). 



Rear seat entertainment system in the G12 


This optional equipment package includes 2 angle-adjustable 10" rear compartment displays which 
can be operated independently of each other. The RSE package also contains for the first time a Touch 
Command tablet for operation of the system and a Blu-Ray drive in the RSE control unit.

G12 Rear Seat Entertainment 

1. Introduction 

1.3. Variants 

1.3.1. Which optional equipment is available? 

• The audio control for the rear passenger compartment (SA 6FK) is planned as a simple audio 
remote control for the rear passenger compartment which controls the head unit in the front 
of the vehicle. It is intended for a number of specific countries if the customer there does not 
want a rear seat entertainment system. However, since the radio standard is not compatible 
with the new RDCi, this optional equipment will be offered only for markets where RDCi is 
not available. This is because the systems could interfere with each other. It had not yet been 
decided on the editorial closing date whether this optional equipment will already be available 
for the launch of the G12. 

• When a customer orders the BMW Touch Command Tablet (SA 6U9) (as part of the ZLU- 
Luxury Rear Seating Package), he receives a tablet with 7” display with separate holder and 
charging function (snap-in adapter) in the center armrest of the G12. The Touch Command 

is also used for operation of the head unit at the front and for remote control of the rear seat 

entertainment system via the head unit (Wi-Fi Direct) connection. 

• The optional equipment Rear Seat Entertainment (SA 6FR) comprises the rear seat 
entertainment system with two 10” display screens, RSE control unit and already includes the 
optional equipment 7” Touch Command Tablet (SA 6U9). 

• The Rear Executive Lounge Seating Package (ZRE) is a complete package (available 
only on the 750i G12) and includes Rear Executive Lounge Seating (SA 7GZ) . It also 
includes both the optional equipment Electric Reclining Seat and Footrest (SA 4F4) 

as well as the Executive Lounge Rear Center Console (SA 4F5). The above-mentioned 
optional equipment Rear Seat Entertainment (SA 6FR) including the 7” Touch Command 
Tablet (SA 6U9) is also an important part of the package.

Installation location of RSE control unit 


The RSE control unit, the head unit for the rear seat entertainment system, features an HDMI/MHL 

connection for external sources (games consoles, Apple TV etc.) for the first time in the G12. 

A USB interface for audio and video playback is also provided. Therefore it support a wire-based 
transmission of audio/videos from mobile devices to RSE displays (with the use of the correct cable). 
As an analogue input, a jack socket for audio/video is now integrated instead of the previous (yellow, 
white and red) Cinch input. 

The RSE control unit in the G12 is a completely new development and is characterized by the 
following technical data:

3.1.5. Wireless headphones (KLEER®) 



Wireless transmission for headphones 

Whereas transmission of the audio signals in the RSE in the F01/F02 with CIC was still based on 
infrared technology, wireless transmission is used in the G12, as has already been the case since 

07/12 with the HU-H with wireless transmission based on the KLEER protocol, high-end wireless 
transmission in the 2-4 GHz range has been chosen which supports 14 channels. In contrast to 

conventional Bluetooth protocols, the KLEER protocol ensures uncompressed and thus loss-free 
sound reproduction in the headphones. The voltage is supplied via three standard commercially 
available AAA batteries.

3.2. BMW Touch Command Tablet 

3.2.1. Overview 

In the latest-generation RSE system, the rear passenger compartment controller FCON is replaced 

by a 7” tablet based on the Android operating system. The customer can use this BMW Touch 
Command Tablet (SA 6U9), or Touch Command for short, to control convenience functions, for 
operation of the rear seat entertainment system as a replacement for the rear passenger compartment 
controller as well as for control of the various entertainment and infotainment sources. 



Touch Command tablet in the rear passenger compartment of the G12 


In addition, the Touch Command can also leave the BMW interface and be operated as a standard 
Android device. Surfing on the internet is then possible both via the hotspot integrated in the vehicle 
as well as outside the vehicle in the area covered by an external hotspot.

G12 Rear Seat Entertainment 
3. Rear Seat Entertainment System 

3.2.2. Touch Command connection 

Vehicle Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi®Direct) 

The Touch Command is connected to the vehicle via WLAN in two ways. Via the Vehicle Wi-Fi (Wi- 

Fi®Direct) and, if present, via the Internet Hotspot in connection with the standard equipment Wi-Fi 
Hotspot (SA 6WD). 

The Touch Command is integrated in the vehicle Wi-Fi for control and monitoring functions. 

The Vehicle Wi-Fi is a certified standard of the Wi-Fi Alliance which is called Wi-Fi Direct. 

http://www.wi-fi.org 

Wi-Fi Direct is a standard for data transmission between two WLAN end devices without central 
Access Point. It is based on the international standard IEEE 802.11 (ISO/IEC 8802-11), which 
describes the properties of a wireless network. 

In the G12, this data transmission always takes place by means of Wi-Fi Direct between the head unit 
(with connected WLAN antenna) and the following end devices: 

• Between head unit and smartphone for the “Screencast” function 
(see “G12 Telephone and telematic systems” training manual). 

• Between head unit and Touch Command for the control and 
monitoring functions via tablet PC.

3.3. Wi-Fi Hotspot 

3.3.1. Wi-Fi Hotspot 

Wi-Fi Hotspot 

The Wi-Fi Hotspot (SA 6WD) is included (as a 100% option) on US market vehicles. It is used by 
customer access to the internet (world wide web) from their phone while in the vehicle. The 

term "Wi-Fi" is commonly used instead of WLAN. That is why the term Wi-Fi with the corresponding 
logo is often used in combination with the WLAN hotspot. 



The hotspot is a multi-point connection similar to a home network. The hotspot performs the task 
of a "hub", as familiar from network technology. The customer can connect up to 10 devices to the 
hotspot (hub) and surf on the internet with a maximum download speed of up to 100 Mbit/s. A "Client 
to Client" connection is not possible. In other words, the devices cannot communicate with each other. 
In network terms, this means that the "hub" does not have a "bridge" function. 


The hotspot function can be used by the customer in combination with an existing or additional mobile 
data plan. The hardware in the vehicle for the hotspot is coupled to the optional equipment wireless 
charging (SA 6NW) which includes convenient telephone (SA 6NS). 


The hotspot function can be used by the customer in combination with an existing or additional cell 
data plan. The customer must independently extend the data plan with the provider in the Europe 
and US versions. The procedure is similar to that for booking hotspot access in a hotel or a public 
hotspot in a cafe. After the data connection is set up between the end device (smartphone, tablet PC, 
etc.) and the hotspot, a provider page will be displayed where the customer can independently extend 
the data contract. 


If the booking is successful, a connection will be set up to the free, unfiltered internet via the MIMO- 
LTE data connection in the TCB2. TEL1 and TEL2 in the roof antenna/roof fin are defined as telematic 
antennas for reception. Information on this is provided in the information bulletin "G12 Telephone and 
telematics".

The hotspot allows the customer free access to the internet for his smart devices (smartphones, 
tablets, PC, etc.) and also permits internet access with the Touch Command table available for the 
Rear Seat Entertainment. 


For the first time at BMW, the emergency antenna (BACKUP or ECALL antenna) integrated in the 
TCB2 is used as the hotspot antenna for the hotspot in the entire vehicle interior.

3.4.2. Zoning 

To simplify operation of entertainment devices in the driving area and rear area of the passenger 
compartment for the customer, a simple control concept was defined for media operation through 
"zoning". 

Media that are inserted, plugged in or streamed to the head unit at the front, in the driving area or head 
unit area of the vehicle, can be operated and played back at the front by means of the controller or CID 
on the Head Unit High 2. 

There is also a zone whose sources can be accessed jointly at the front and rear of the vehicle. 

Media that are inserted or plugged into the RSE control unit in the rear passenger compartment can 
be operated and played only via the Touch Command or KLEER remote control.

Serving function 

In addition, the driver/front passenger can also "serve" a function to the rear seat entertainment 
system. One or both rear compartment displays are then selected under the main menu "Media/ 
Radio" in the submenu "Rear". Only entertainment sources are available for the "serving" function. 

Language settings 

A special feature applies when the vehicle language is changed. If the vehicle language is changed, the 

Touch Command connected via Wi-Fi Direct is also rebooted and the Touch Command tablet starts in 
the changed language variant of the vehicle. 

A 

Changing the language version in the Android application of the operating system of the Touch 
Command tablet (apps installed on the Touch Command tablet) does not influence the set vehicle 
language of the tablet.

4. Touch Command Update 

4.1. Background 

The Touch Command Tablet is downwardly compatible and can therefore communicate with all 
vehicle electrical system versions and integration levels that support a Touch Command. This 
communication basis is lost, however, if the vehicle electrical system is programmed to a higher 
integration level by the BMW programming system. The Touch Command Tablet must then also be 
programmed. It is updated via a special program, the Touch Command Service Updater (TCSU). 
This is distributed to the shared storage of the BMW service workshop via an online update. A current 

driver program for Android tablets from SAMSUNG is made available together with the TSCU. 

Among other things, the cached navigation map data is also stored on this shared storage, a small, 
autonomous NAS server. Programming via the BMW programming system (ISTA/P or ISTA Next) is not 
planned. 


4.2. Update process 

The Touch Command tablet is switched to download mode by means of a key combination described 
in the TCSU manual. The Touch Command is then connected with the PC or laptop on which 
TCSU.exe is located. In the next step TCSU.exe is launched on the laptop. The update program Touch 
Command Service Updater runs separately here as TCSU.exe without installing itself in the operating 
system when executed. 

A 

If the tablet is not shown as added, this may be due to too many apps being active. Please close all 
apps on the Touch Command and restart the process. The same applies to the Windows PC if too 
many programs are being run here simultaneously. 

A 

The package is offered in WUSS for BMW branches that require the admin rights for installation of the 
driver!
