G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 


The range of existing assistance systems has been expanded in the G12 to include new innovative 
systems. The interplay between the varied and intelligent assistance systems supports the driver in 
every respect; from making driving more comfortable to providing the reassuring feeling of safety 
on all roads. 

The assistance systems help to make the driver's life easier by: 

• providing the driver with information 

• prompting the driver with suggestions 

• automatically intervening in the driving process 

This information bulletin contains an overview of all the assistance systems used in the G12: 

• Camera-based collision warning 

• Collision warning with city braking function 

• Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

• Road sign recognition 

• Proactive Active Driving Assistant 

• Lane departure warning 

• Blind spot detection 

• Side collision warning 

• Alertness assistant 

• Night vision 

• Camera systems 

• cross-traffic warning 

• Park Distance Control 

• Parking Maneuver Assistant 

• Speed control 

• Speed limit warning 

• Steering and lane control assistant including traffic jam assistant 

• Active Lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection 

Identifying road users driving ahead as well as detecting objects and lane edges are among the most 
important prerequisites for the assistance systems. This applies not only for the far range but also the 
close range. 

The optional functions available for the G12 are implemented either as camera-based systems with a 
shared camera and integrated control unit, or as sensor systems such as ultrasonic or radar sensors. 
Evaluation signals provided by various control units (for example, from the Advanced Crash Safety 
Module (ACSM)) are also taken into consideration. 

For more information on the operating concept of the assistance systems, please refer to the Owner's 
Handbook.

3. KAFAS 


As the requirements placed on the KAFAS camera have increased in the G12, the existing 
monochrome camera has been replaced by a stereo camera. 



KAFAS stereo camera 


The KAFAS stereo camera is composed of two high-resolution CMOS monochrome cameras, 
which are installed in a housing with approximately 20 cm between them. The KAFAS stereo camera 
housing now also serves as an equipment holder for the KAFAS control unit, which has more powerful 
processors. 



KAFAS stereo camera 


CMOS cameras are characterized by their low power consumption, compact size and very high 
frame rate. 

CMOS = Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor 

The KAFAS stereo camera is calibrated within a distance of approximately 2 km during driving. 
The KAFAS stereo camera is the key element of the following systems:

G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

3. KAFAS 

• Tailgate warning 

• Collision warning with city braking function 

• Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

• Lane departure warning 

• Road sign recognition. 

The KAFAS stereo camera plays a supporting role in the following systems: 

• Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go (ACC) 

• Steering and lane control assistant including traffic jam assistant 

• Active lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection 

3.1. Detection range 

Due to differences in perspective between the left and right optical path of the camera, the stereo 
camera is able to measure the distance to an object and now also its height above road level. 

While the monochrome camera merely estimates distances, the stereo camera can determine the 
distance to an object fairly accurately - to within approximately 20 to 30 cm - from approximately 
40 m away.

3. KAFAS 


In principle, the evaluation electronics in the KAFAS stereo camera use the same effect as is used in a 
human to create spatial vision. This is known as the parallax shift between two images. 

The KAFAS stereo camera not only enables the position of an object to be determined, but also its 
movement and direction of movement. For every pixel of a detected object, the direction of movement 
on the horizontal, vertical and longitudinal axis can be determined. 

The KAFAS stereo camera has a detection range of up to approximately 40 m ahead of the vehicle and 
up to approximately 5 m in front of the vehicle on the right and left. The overall detection range of the 
KAFAS stereo camera is approximately 500 m. 


3.2. Person recognition 

The KAFAS stereo camera captures the scene in front of the vehicle and detects entire rear views of 
moving and stationary vehicles in the field of view using image processing. The KAFAS stereo camera 
also ensures that driving lane information, vehicle positions and movements are determined at the 
same time. 

With the aid of the image data from the KAFAS stereo camera, objects can be clearly identified as 
vehicles and their transverse movements as lane changes. The KAFAS stereo camera also detects 
people and cyclists. 





Example of pedestrian recognition by the KAFAS stereo camera: pedestrian approaching from the side steps into the road and is partially hidden 

The two separate optical paths are also beneficial in challenging conditions, for example difficult 
lighting conditions, where there is low contrast between the image and background or when several 
objects are closely lined up one after the other. 

Thanks to the redundant image detection of the stereo camera, it is now possible to reliably detect 
obstacles and determine their size from a single image.

3.3. Road sign recognition 

The KAFAS stereo camera is also responsible for detecting top speed limitation road signs. 
The detection of no overtaking/overtaking permitted signs or markings is also implemented in 
the G12. 


3.4. Lane detection 

The KAFAS stereo camera installed in the mirror base of the interior mirror on the windshield monitors 
the area in front of the vehicle.

The KAFAS stereo camera records the roadway up to approximately 40 m ahead of the vehicle and 
up to approximately 5 m to the right and left of the vehicle. The image data is then evaluated by the 
KAFAS control unit integrated in the KAFAS stereo camera. Using image processing, the control unit 
searches the images recorded by the KAFAS stereo camera for lane and road markings. 

The appearance of the road markings can vary considerably in the image depending on the country, 
type of road or the current ambient conditions. The system can detect a wide range of road markings 
and types of markings. For a lane marking to be evaluated, the KAFAS stereo camera and the KAFAS 
control unit must first be able to clearly identify it. A lane must also have an average width greater than 
2.5 m for it to be evaluated.

3. KAFAS 

3.5. Detection of the road condition 

The KAFAS stereo camera in the G12 also detects the road condition. 

In vehicles with the Executive Drive Pro optional equipment (OE 2VS),the data collected is used 
to adapt the chassis and suspension setting to the road condition by changing various setting 
parameters in the Dynamic Drive (ARS) and Electronic Damper Control (EDC) and tailoring the 
interaction with the two-axle air suspension. 



Detection of road bumps with the help of the stereo camera 


Objects can now be dealt with actively instead of reactively, and therefore more easily, at speeds of 
approximately 15 to 100 km/h. 

The structure of the vehicle moves less vertically, as the vehicle drives in harmony with the road. 
Bumps are less noticeable for the driver. 


3.6. Functional limitations 

The function of the KAFAS stereo camera and thus the function of the corresponding assistance 
systems may be impaired due to the physical limits of the optical systems, for example in the 
following situations: 

• Fleavy fog, rain, spray or snow 

• Strong light in the camera lens 

• If the field of view of the KAFAS stereo camera or the windscreen is dirty 

• On tight bends 

• If boundary lines are missing, worn, poorly visible, converging or diverging, or not 
clearly recognizable, as may be the case when roadworks are being carried out 

• If boundary lines are covered by snow, ice, dirt or water 

• If boundary lines are covered by objects 


9 







G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

3. KAFAS 

• If driving at close proximity to a vehicle driving ahead 

• If the windscreen in front of the interior mirror is misted over, soiled or covered by stickers, e.g. 
tax discs, etc. 

• Up to 10 seconds after driving readiness is activated via the start/stop button 

• During the calibration process for the KAFAS stereo camera immediately after vehicle delivery 
or a camera change 



Example of limits of the KAFAS stereo camera

Due to functional limitations and system restrictions it may transpire that warnings and orders are not 
issued, are issued too late or are unwarranted. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively 
intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident.

6. Intelligent Safety 

Due to the ever increasing amount of traffic on our roads, assistance systems in vehicles continue to 
gain in importance. They assist the driver on highways, single-lane roads and in urban environments. 

Urban traffic is just one area that presents an ever increasing number of challenges. Car drivers must 
be constantly aware of cyclists and pedestrians. Systems such as the pedestrian warning with city 
brake activation are helpful in this respect. Night Vision can assist the driver when driving on single¬ 
lane roads with adjacent woodland (deer crossings, etc.). The lane departure and Blind spot detection 
as well as the side collision warning provide even more safety in traffic. Accidents can be avoided 
through automatic brake interventions, active steering interventions or a combination of both. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, Intelligent Safety consists of one or several systems, which can 
help to avoid a potential collision. The following systems are offered in the G12: 

• Tailgate warning with braking function 

• Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

• Night Vision with person and animal recognition 

• Lane departure warning 

• Blind spot detection 

• Side collision warning 

The Intelligent Safety button enables the assistance systems to be operated centrally. This means the 
systems can be switched on or off using a button and the submenu can be called up to personalize the 
settings.

7. Collision Warning 

The camera-based collision warning is part of the Active Driving Assistant optional equipment 
(OE 5AS) in the G12 and is implemented using the KAFAS stereo camera. 

The collision warning in the new BMW 7 Series contains the familiar "Collision warning with city 
brake activation" and the "Pedestrian warning with city brake activation" functions. 

In vehicles with the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function optional equipment (OE ZN7), 
the cruise control radar sensor is also used to control the collision warning. 

Vehicles with the Active Driving Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT) have the Active Cruise 
Control with Stop&Go function optional equipment (OE ZN7) integrated as standard. 

If the vehicle is not equipped with the Active Driving Assistant (OE 5AS) or Active Driving Assistant 
Plus (OE 5AT) optional equipment, but does have the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function 
optional equipment (OE ZN7), the customer also receives a collision warning. However, in this case 
the pedestrian warning is not included. 

The system warns the driver in situations where a collision is imminent. The early warning, a visual 
signal, is issued first to draw the driver's attention to the situation. If the situation becomes more 
critical, an acute early warning in the form of a visual and acoustic signal is issued. The nature of the 
warning is such that the driver can still prevent a collision providing he acts quickly. 


7.1. Functional principle 

The KAFAS stereo camera captures the scene in front of the vehicle and detects entire rear views 
of moving and stationary vehicles in the field of view using image processing. 

In vehicles with the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function optional equipment (OE ZN7), in 
addition to the KAFAS stereo camera image data, information from the radar sensor is also evaluated.

The corresponding warning stages "early warning" and "acute warning" are output in critical situations 
on the basis of the calculated positions, distances and relative speeds of other vehicles. For the early 
warning the brakes of the vehicle are prepared for emergency braking and the activation thresholds of 
the Dynamic Brake Control are reduced. If the driver makes the conscious decision to drive up close 
to the vehicle ahead, warnings which may otherwise be distracting can be prevented by reducing the 
sensitivity of the system. 

7.1.1. Collision warning with city braking function 

The collision warning with city brake activation (City Collision Mitigation option OE ZN3) adds a brake 
activation function to the camera-based collision warning from a speed of roughly 5 km/h up to a 
maximum speed of 80 km/h. If there is still no response from the driver in this speed range after an 
acute warning is issued, the vehicle is decelerated at a maximum rate of 4 m/s 2 .

The duration of the brake intervention is limited to approximately 1.5 seconds. Additional dangers for 
the traffic behind are therefore avoided.

7.1.2. Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

The pedestrian warning with city braking function (Daytime pedestrian detection OE ZN2) is designed 
to prevent possible collisions with pedestrians in urban areas or reduce the effects of an accident. The 
system warns of a possible collision with pedestrians from a speed of approximately 10 km/h up to a 
maximum speed of 60 km/h and assists the driver with a brake intervention shortly before a collision. 

The KAFAS stereo camera captures the scene in front of the vehicle and detects pedestrians in the 
field of view using image processing. 



Example of person recognition by KAFAS camera 


Based on the calculated positions, distances and the movement of the detected pedestrians, an acute 
warning is issued in critical situations. An early warning is not available for the pedestrian warning with 
city braking function (OE ZN2). 

With an acute warning the vehicle is decelerated by roughly 4 m/s 2 . The duration of the brake 
intervention is limited to approximately 1.5 seconds. Additional dangers for the traffic behind are 
therefore avoided. 


7.2. Warning and braking function 

The operating principle of the collision warning is based on a detection and warning algorithm. 
Machine vision detects pedestrians and vehicles in the detection range of the camera. If there is a 
risk of a collision, a warning symbol is shown in the instrument cluster (KOMBI), or in the Head-Up 
Display for vehicles with the Head-Up Display standard equipment (OE 610). The warning function is 
divided into two stages. The next probable movement of an object is determined based on the current 
movement of the detected object and, taking into account the movement of the object, a collision 
risk is identified. If a situation is evaluated as critical by the warning algorithm, a warning is issued and 
braking is introduced based on a multistage warning concept. The warnings and brake interventions 
differ for pedestrians and vehicles.

Acute warning: 

• Person symbol flashes red and a signal 
sounds 

• Request for intervention by braking and 
evasive action, if required 


7.2.2. Early warning 

Occasions when an early warning is issued include when there is a collision risk because the vehicle 
driving ahead is being driven at a much slower speed and/or if the distance to a driven or stationary 
vehicle ahead is extremely short. 

An early warning is indicated by a vehicle symbol which lights up red in the instrument cluster (KOMBI) 
or Head-Up Display. The early warning is only issued for vehicles and not for pedestrians. 

The point at which the early warning is issued can be configured in the "Intelligent Safety systems 11 
menu on the central information display (CID). 

A_ 

The collision warning is dependent on the vehicle's own driving speed. The distance measured for the 
collision warning is significantly lower than the legally required minimum distance. It is therefore the 
responsibility of the driver to adhere to the legal minimum distance. 


7.2.3. Acute warning 

The acute warning is issued by the system as late as possible and only if there is an imminent danger 
of a collision when the vehicle is approaching the vehicle driving ahead at a relatively high differential 
speed or if there is an imminent danger of a collision with a pedestrian. The time of the acute warning 
is measured so that a collision can only be avoided by immediate emergency braking or by swerving. 
The acute warning therefore cannot be deliberately brought about or monitored by the driver. The 
acute warning is issued for vehicles and pedestrians. 


22 








G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

7. Collision Warning 

If the vehicle is approaching the vehicle driving ahead or a pedestrian at a very low speed, an acute 
warning is not issued even when the distance is very small. This intentional driving situation only 
triggers the early warning. This way there are fewer meaningless and annoying acute warnings issued 
by the system. 

The acute warning cannot be deactivated separately. The timing of the acute warning also cannot be 
adjusted. If the acute warning is not to be issued, the "collision warning" front protective function must 
be deactivated. 

If an acute warning is issued, this is indicated to the driver by a red flashing vehicle symbol or a red 
flashing person symbol in the instrument cluster (KOMBI) or Head-Up Display. In addition, an acoustic 
warning signal is sounded. 

The acute warning for pedestrians is issued within a speed range of approximately 10 km/h to 60 km/h. 
The acute warning for vehicles is issued at speeds above approximately 5 km/h. 

When the acute warning is issued, the brake system is also preconditioned in order to achieve quicker 
and sharper deceleration. With these measures the driver also receives specific support at the same 
time as the warning in order to be able to respond effectively. 

A_ 

The acute warning does not relieve the driver of his responsibility to adapt the speed and driving style 
to the traffic conditions. 


7.2.4. Brake intervention 

With the camera based, collision warning w/ city collision mitigation (OE ZN3 included with OE 5AS); 

If the driver no longer has the option to avoid the accident with his own response, automatic brake 
intervention is effected as a last step. The brake intervention is effected at a brake force of about 4 ml 
s 2 (camera based) and can have the effect of avoiding a collision up to a differential speed of about 
18 km/h. At higher differential speeds the impact speed is reduced by a smaller amount. Just like the 
driver can support the effect of the system, he also has the option of overriding and thus cancelling 
the automatic panic braking at any time with a steering wheel movement (avoidance maneuver), by 
accelerating or with a sharp brake intervention. 

With the camera and radar based, collision warning system (included with OE 5AT); If the driver no 
longer has the option to avoid the accident with his own response, automatic brake intervention is 
effected as a last step. The brake intervention is effected at a brake force of about 8 m/s 2 (camera/radar 
based) and can have the effect of avoiding a collision up to a differential speed (delta) of about 30 km/ 
h. 

Therefore, both systems can bring car to a stop, the difference is that you are more likely to see this 
happen in a 5AT car then a 5AS car. This is why 5AS is referred to as “city collision MITIGATION” 
because this is the more likely use case as opposed to “AVOIDANCE” with 5AT. 

The brake intervention is effected for pedestrians in the speed range between 10 and 60 km/h and for 
vehicles in the speed range between 5 and 60 km/h. 

For a brake intervention to be possible, the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) must be switched on.

7.4. Limits of the system 

Range of detection 

A 

The collision warning has a limited capacity for detection. 

As a result, incorrect or delayed warnings may occur. It is possible the following vehicles are not 
detected: 

• A slow vehicle when driving off at high speed 

• Vehicles that suddenly swerve or decelerate rapidly 

• vehicles with an unusual rear view or with insufficiently visible rear lights 

• Partially concealed vehicles 

• Two-wheeled vehicles travelling ahead. 

Functional limitations 

The function of the KAFAS stereo camera and thus also the function of the corresponding assistance 
systems may be impaired in the following situations, for example: 

• Heavy fog, rain, spray or snow 

• Insufficient light 

• Strong light in the camera lens 

• If the field of view of the KAFAS stereo camera or the windscreen is dirty 

• On sharp bends 

• With pedestrians up to approximately 80 cm in height 

• Up to 10 seconds after the engine start via the START-STOP button 

• During the calibration process for the KAFAS stereo camera immediately after vehicle delivery 
or a camera change 


A 

Due to functional limitations and system restrictions it may transpire that warnings and orders are not 
issued, are issued too late or are unwarranted. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively 
intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is a risk of an accident. 


27 











G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

8. Lane Departure Warning 


The lane departure warning is an element of the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant (SA 5AS) 
and the optional equipment Active Driving Assistant Plus (SA 5AT). 

The lane departure warning detects lane markings from a speed of approximately 70 km/h and warns 
the driver against unintentionally leaving the lane. 

The information required about usable roadway and lane markings is provided by the KAFAS stereo 
camera. Based on the calculated positions, lane edges and curves in relation to the relative position of 
the driver's vehicle, a corresponding warning is issued. 

If the driver crosses the lane marking unintentionally (without using the turn indicator) or leaves the 
road boundary, he is warned by the steering wheel vibrating gently and has the opportunity to react 
accordingly. The vibration in the steering wheel can be compared to the vibration effect when driving 
over a profiled road marking. 

In the settings menu the driver can set the desired strength of the vibration warning on the steering 
wheel via the Drive.

8.1. Active steering intervention 

In vehicles with the side collision warning (included in Active Driving Assistant Plus optional equipment 
OE 5AT), the driver is assisted by another measure known as "active steering intervention". 

If the driver does not react to the warning issued by the lane departure warning system and crosses 
the lane marking, he is assisted to stay in lane by a brief active steering intervention. 



G12 active steering intervention

The active steering intervention can be felt on the steering wheel, but can be overridden by the driver 
at any time. If the driver does override the intervention, the active steering intervention is cancelled. 

The "steering intervention" for the lane departure warning can be switched on and off in the Drive 
menu in vehicles with the side collision warning by making the following selection via the controller: 

• "My Vehicle"

8.3. Deactivation criteria 

The lane departure warning is available at a speed range from 70 to 210 km/h. 

A warning is not issued in the following situations: 

• When the driver uses the turn indicator 

• In roadworks 

• When the lane width is less than 2.60 m 
The warning is cancelled in the following situations: 

• Automatically after approximately 3 seconds 

• As soon as the driver moves back into his own lane 

• If the turn indicator is used 

• When sharp braking or steering maneuvers are made and 
when the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) intervenes. 

8.4. Limits of the system 

The function of the system may not be available or may only be available to a limited extent in the 
following situations: 

• heavy fog, rain or snow 

• at sharp bends or on narrow roadways 

• if boundary lines are covered by snow, ice, dirt or water 

• if boundary lines are covered by objects 

• if boundary lines are missing, worn, poorly visible, converging or diverging, 
or not clearly recognizable, such as when driving through roadworks 


A 

The system does not replace the personal assessment of the road and the traffic situation. The lane 
departure warning is only intended to assist the driver. When active lane departure warnings are 
issued, the steering wheel should not be moved through any unnecessarily heavy-handed actions. 


34 





G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

9. Blind Spot Detection 

The Blind spot detection system can detect traffic situations that could pose a risk if the driver 
changes lane. These traffic situations include vehicles approaching quickly from behind or vehicles 
in the driver's blind spot. 

The driver may find it difficult to judge these situations, especially when it is dark. The radar sensors 
detect vehicles in the blind spot and work effectively regardless of the lighting conditions. In addition, 
they are able to reliably detect such situations up to a distance of approximately 70 m away and 
irrespective of the weather conditions. 



G12 vehicle detection using radar sensors (Blind spot detection) 

When a vehicle is approaching quickly or moves into the blind spot of the driver's vehicle, the system 
assists the driver by correctly judging the situation. If the lane next to the driver's vehicle is occupied, 
the radar sensors detect the vehicles in the neighboring lane. 

The control units (radar sensors) for the Blind spot detection (SWW) are located under the rear 
bumper. 



G12 Blind spot detection (SWW) (radar sensors) 

The control unit for the Blind spot detection (SWW) (primary) is installed on the right and the control 
unit for the Blind spot detection (SWW2) (secondary) is installed on the left. 


When a vehicle is detected and the system is activated, the driver is informed of the situation by an 
unobtrusive indicator in the exterior mirror. By having this information before making a lane change 
maneuver, the driver can confidently prepare for the lane change and avoid critical situations from 


35

the outset. 

The Blind spot detection indicators are located in the exterior mirror glass. 



G12 signal unit (LED) in mirror glass 


If the driver intends to make a lane change in what the system detects to be a critical situation, and 
demonstrates this intention by using the turn indicator, the second, more severe "warning" is issued. 
The corresponding indicator in the exterior mirror flashes with high intensity and the steering wheel 
starts to vibrate. This warns the driver using the exact operating element that he must use to make the 
dangerous situation safe. To avoid a potential collision, the driver must steer the vehicle back into his 
own lane. 

The Blind spot detection can be configured individually in the Intelligent Safety system submenu.

10. Side Collision Warning 

The side collision warning is part of the active lane keeping assistant with active side collision 
protection. The active lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection is part of the scope of 
supply of the Active Driving Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT). The side collision warning is 
not available separately. 

The side collision warning assists the driver in avoiding a potential side collision. 

If an object with which the vehicle could potentially collide, such as a vehicle or a crash barrier, is 
detected to the side of the driver's vehicle, the driver is assisted in avoiding the potential collision. 

Four radar sensors monitor the area next to the vehicle and function regardless of the lighting 
conditions and largely irrespective of the weather conditions. 



G12 vehicle detection using radar sensors (side collision warning) 


If there is a risk of a collision, the corresponding indicator flashes (depending on which side the risk 
relates to, left or right) in the exterior mirror with high intensity and the steering wheel starts to vibrate.

The steering intervention is initiated within a speed range of between 70 km/h and 210 km/h. 

The active steering intervention can be felt on the steering wheel, but can be manually overridden by 
the driver at any time.

G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

10. Side Collision Warning 

Functional prerequisites 

A prerequisite for the activation of the side collision warning with steering intervention is that the 
lane markings must be detected by the KAFAS stereo camera. 

If the lane markings are not detected or if the driver is driving within the speed range of 30 km/h 
to 70 km/h, only the reduced side collision warning is active. The warning functions in the form of 
the flashing indicator in the exterior mirror and the vibration of the steering wheel continue to be 
implemented. 

With the reduced side collision warning there is no active lateral guidance of the vehicle. In this case 
the driver is only warned by a single steering wheel pulse on the opposite side of the wheel to the 
danger. 

The side collision warning can be switched on and off in the iDrive menu by making the following 
selection via the controller: 

• "My Vehicle" 

• "Vehicle settings" 

• "Intelligent Safety" 

• "Side Collision Warning" 

The configuration menu can be accessed quickly by pressing the Intelligent Safety button.

road sign recognition from now on in this document. Current top speed limitations and no overtaking 
signs are detected by the road sign recognition system and displayed in the instrument cluster or the 
Head-Up Display in the form of road sign symbols.

Explanation 

1 

Road sign recognition (example: a detected top speed limitation is displayed) 


The display of road signs is based on the evaluation of data from the navigation system and the 
evaluation of image data recorded by the KAFAS stereo camera. 

The KAFAS stereo camera detects road signs at the edge of the road and also the variable displays of 
gantry signs. Road signs containing additional information, e.g. "In wet conditions", are also detected 
and synchronised with vehicle-internal data, e.g. the rain sensor, and displayed depending on the 
situation. 

The system also takes the applicable time restrictions identified into account, e.g. "between 10.00 
pm and 6.00 am". The current time of the on-board clock is used for this. The system takes the 
information stored in the navigation system into account and displays existing top speed limitations 
on sections of road without signage. 

Road sign recognition (Speed Limit Information) is part of the Active Driving Assistant optional 
equipment (OE 5AS) in the G12. 

A 

The system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the visibility and 
traffic situation. The driver is solely responsible for the vehicle and the speed at which it is driven.

11. Road Sign Recognition 

11.1. Operation 

The road sign recognition can be switched on and off in the Drive menu, by making the following 
selection via the controller: 

• "My Vehicle" 

• "System settings" 

• "Displays" 

• "Instrument Cluster" 

• Apply desired settings. 


11.2. Limits of the system 

Road signs for top speed limitations that do not comply with the legal standard, particularly those 
without circular frames, are not always detected. The same also applies for traffic signs which are fully 
or partially covered by labels, dirt or vegetation. Long distances to the road sign, high driving speeds 
and poor weather conditions, particularly at night, make it more difficult for the system to recognize 
road signs reliably. To ensure the current top speed limitations are displayed as accurately as possible, 
the data of the navigation road map should be up-to-date. 

The functionality of the road sign recognition may be impaired in the following situations and may lead 
to incorrect information being displayed: 

• heavy fog, rain or snow 

• if signs are covered by objects 

• If driving at close proximity to a vehicle driving ahead 

• Strong light in the camera lens 

• if the windscreen in front of the interior mirror is misted over, soiled or covered by stickers, etc. 

• as a result of incorrect detection by the camera 

• if the top speed limitations stored in the navigation system are incorrect 

• in areas not covered by the navigation system 

• in the event of deviations from the navigation, e.g. due to modified road layouts 

• when overtaking buses or trucks with speed limit stickers 

• if road signs do not correspond to the standard 

• when calibrating the camera immediately after vehicle delivery. 

Supplementary sign recognition 

Only additional characters with symbols (icons) can be recognized by the system, such as "in wet 
weather", "in rain/snow", "truck" or "trailer", etc. Text notes on additional characters can generally not 
be read or interpreted. 


46 





G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

11. Road Sign Recognition 

Additional information is requested by the system from the vehicle electrical system before displaying 
speed limits or no overtaking signs with restrictive validity. For example, for "in wet weather" signs the 
status of the wiper is evaluated or for "in frost/snow" the temperature value of the outside temperature 
sensor is evaluated. 

Temporal restrictions of the speed limit or no overtaking sign can only be evaluated correctly if the 
validity duration is stored in the navigation map and the clock is set correctly in the vehicle. Otherwise, 
the speed limit or the no overtaking sign is displayed as currently valid. 

The trailer signal for vehicles in trailer towing is not evaluated for the display of speed limits as the 
speed limits for vehicles with trailer are specific to the national market and dependent on the trailer 
type. 

Other additional characters are not recognized. The speed limit or the no overtaking sign is then 
displayed as currently valid without the interpretation of the additional character. 

Road signs on parallel, branching-off or merging roads and on exits 

Parallel roads are not recognized, neither by the KAFAS stereo camera nor with the help of the 
navigation map. Signs on these roads can be recognized and displayed as speed limits or no 
overtaking for the current road. 

Speed limits and no overtaking signs for forking or emerging roads are generally also assumed and 
displayed for the current road. 

Speed limits for exits off highways with or without an arrow as an additional character are generally 
evaluated correctly and suppressed in the display if driven past. This is only the case if the data on the 
navigation map is up-to-date. 

In the case of gantry signs on the highway with different, lane-dependent speed limits, the speed limit 
which is closest to the vehicle's lane is displayed. There is no adaptation of the display after a later lane 
change. 

Information signs in the road sign surroundings 

Information signs with speed limits or no overtaking stipulations, such as at border crossing points 
with information on the different legal maximum speeds for single-lane roads and highways, may be 
incorrectly recognized as currently valid and displayed. The same applies to information signs with 
different color configurations, for example for minimum or recommended speeds. 

Stickers on vehicles 

Stickers with a speed limit on vehicles ahead or overtaken, such as trucks, buses, trailers or 
construction machinery, etc., may be incorrectly recognized as a currently valid speed limit and 
displayed. 

Town/city limits 

If the sign for the entrance to a village/town is not clearly recognized and the data from the navigation 
map is not up-to-date, the speed limit at the entrances to and exits from villages/towns may be 
displayed incorrectly. 

Legal changes 

If legally prescribed maximum speeds change, then these are only available after a software update. 

Up until the update the original, current but no longer valid speed limits are displayed. 


47 



G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

11. Road Sign Recognition 

General no overtaking signs 

No overtaking signs are only displayed if these are also signs posted. General no overtaking 
stipulations, for example that apply at level crossings or are marked by a continuous white line on the 
roadway, are not displayed unless an additional sign is present. 

A 

The system does not replace the personal assessment of the traffic situation. Due to system 
restrictions and functional limitations, it may transpire that warnings and orders are not issued, are 
issued too late or are unwarranted. The road sign recognition supports the driver and does not replace 
the human eye.

G12 Driver Assistance Systems 
12. Proactive Active Driving Assistant 


The proactive Active Driving Assistant points out to the driver the ideal time at which to release the 
accelerator in order to reduce consumption, thus enabling the driver to save fuel. 

Data from the navigation system is evaluated as the basis for the calculation. Using this data, sections 
of road ahead that require a reduction in speed can be detected in good time. 

Relevant sections of road are: 


• Intersections 

• Bends 

• Crossroads 

• Roundabouts 

• Entrances to towns 

• Top speed limitations 

• Highway exits 

The proactive Active Driving Assistant function is available in the G12 in conjunction with the 
Navigation System Professional optional equipment (OE 609). 

To ensure the coasting function is used to its full potential, the proactive Active Driving Assistant takes 
into account whether coasting is currently possible and adapts the time that the information is issued 
accordingly. The proactive Active Driving Assistant actively cancels coasting if it is possible to reach a 
section of road ahead in coasting overrun mode. 

The proactive Active Driving Assistant helps drivers who are not familiar with the route or area to drive 
more efficiently. 

Display 



G12 proactive Active Driving Assistant displays in the instrument cluster 


An indicator in the instrument cluster or Head-Up Display (only with optional equipment OE 610) alerts 
the driver that he is on a section of road relevant for the proactive Active Driving Assistant and gives 
him the option to react accordingly. 

The driver can activate or deactivate the indicator in the Head-Up Display separately. 


49 







G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

12. Proactive Active Driving Assistant 

The alert is issued even if the section of road ahead cannot yet be seen by the driver. This information 
is displayed in the instrument cluster or Head-Up Display (optional equipment OE 610) until the road 
section is reached. If the vehicle is decelerated considerably before reaching the road section, the 
indicator goes out before the section is reached.

The proactive Active Driving Assistant can be used when the route guidance is either active or 
inactive. When the route guidance is not active, the most likely route is used for evaluation. However, 
the calculation can be performed more accurately, and therefore more efficiently, when the route 
guidance is active.

The reliability of the system depends on the up-to-dateness and quality of the navigation data. 


12.2. Limits of the system 

The proactive Active Driving Assistant is not available in the following situations: 

• Speed below 50 kph 

• Temporary and variable top speed limitation, such as on building sites 

• Quality of navigation data insufficient 

• Cruise control active 

• Trailer towing

G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

13. Alertness Assistant 


The attentiveness assistant helps to avoid accidents caused by tiredness on long, monotonous 
journeys. It is part of the Active Protection equipment (OE 5AL) included in the basic equipment. 

A change in the driver's driving behavior is perceived by the attentiveness assistant. In the event 
of increasing inattentiveness or if the driver is tired, the alertness assistant shows a display 
recommending that the driver take a break as a Check Control message in the central information 
display (CID). 

The alertness assistant is automatically active after each engine start from a speed of roughly 70 km/h. 
If the system is active, a driving behavior profile is created at the beginning of a journey. The following 
criteria are taken into consideration: 

• Personal driving style, for example the steering behavior 

• Driving conditions, for example the time or journey duration 

• Breaks during a long journey 

• Journey duration. 


13.1. Operation 

If the changed driving behavior differs markedly from the taught-in driving behavior of the alertness 
profile, the alertness assistant shows a break recommendation in the central information display (CID). 

While the display is shown on the central information display (CID) the following settings can be 
selected using the controller: 

• "Do not ask again" 

• "Places to stop" 

• "Remind me later" (in this case the break recommendation appears again after a journey 
duration of 20 minutes). 

The break recommendation is only displayed once during an uninterrupted journey (except when 
"Remind later" is selected). 

After a break a new break recommendation is not shown during the next 45 minutes of the journey. 
The system is reset if a break is longer than 50 minutes or if the break lasts longer than the last driving 
time. The driving behavior is re-taught. 

The attentiveness assistant can be switched on and off in the iDrive menu. The driver can also set the 
level of sensitivity in this menu 

by making the following selection via the controller: 

• "My Vehicle" 

• "Vehicle settings" 

• "Attentiveness Assistant" 

• Select desired settings.

13.2. Limits of the system 

The functionality may be impaired in the following situations and no warning or an incorrect warning 
may be issued: 

• If the clock is set incorrectly 

• If the speed is predominantly below approximately 70 km/h 

• If the driver adopts a sporty driving style, for example rapid acceleration or fast cornering 

• In active driving situations, for example frequent lane changes 

• Poor road condition 

• Strong crosswind.

G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

14. Night Vision 

In the G12 the Night Vision system is available in the form of BMW Night Vision with person and animal 
recognition optional equipment (OE 6UK). 

Night Vision detects people and animals in optimum conditions at night up to a distance of 
approximately 100 m away and therefore assists the driver especially on dark and difficult stretches 
of road, such as when driving on single-lane roads with adjacent woods. 

In potentially dangerous situations, the system warns the driver of people and animals on the road. 

The Night Vision camera integrated in the BMW radiator grille records the area in front of the vehicle 
and sends the data to the Night Vision electronics (NVE). 



G12 Night Vision camera 


Heating is switched on to avoid ice forming on the camera at temperatures below 5° C. 

The image data is analyzed by the Night Vision electronics control unit and the corresponding image 
information is sent to the head unit via the Color Video Blanking Signal.

Object detection range 

• Person recognition: up to about 100 m 

• Recognition of large animals: up to about 150 m 

• Recognition of medium-sized animals: up to about 70 m 

Night Vision detects people and determines their position and distance from the vehicle. Taking into 
account the driving speed and steering angle, the system calculates whether there is a potential risk 
and displays a warning sign (early warning) in the instrument cluster and in the Head-Up Display, if 
present. 

In critical situations a warning signal also sounds (acute warning). 

The warning threshold values are also dependent on whether the person or the animal is moving or 
standing still. This is highlighted in the following graphic. 

Early warning 

The early warning is effected if a person or animal is detected inside the warning range. The early 
warning shows, depending on the location of the person or animal, a person or animal in yellow which 
is located inside the actual lane or is moving into the lane. Animals from a certain height can 
be detected, for example deer.

swerving. With the acute warning the brakes of the vehicle are prepared for emergency braking. 

The acute warning in the instrument cluster and in the Head-Up Display shows a red flashing person 
or animal symbol on the roadway. In addition, an acoustic warning signal is sounded.

14.3. Limits of the system 

The functionality may be impaired in the following situations and no warning or an incorrect warning 
may be issued: 

• On steep summits or dips and tight bends 

• If the camera is dirty or the protective screen is damaged 

• In heavy fog, rain or snow 

• If the outside temperatures are very high 

The person and animal recognition may also be impaired or may not issue the usual warnings. This 
can occur in the following cases: 

• If the person or animal is fully or partially hidden, particularly the head 

• If the person is not in an upright position, e.g. if they are lying down 

• If a bike has non-conventional wheels, e.g. recumbent bicycle 

• If the system has been affected mechanically, e.g. after an accident 

In certain cases small animals may be entirely visible on the central information display, but may not be 
identified by the object detection. As a consequence, a warning is also not issued. 

A 

The system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the visibility and 
traffic situation. The driver is solely responsible for the vehicle and the speed at which it is driven.

15. Cameras 


The optional equipment Surround View (SA 5DL) is part of ZDB Driver Assistance Plus and provides 
support when parking, maneuvering, as well as at unclear exits and crossroads. In the G12, the 
Surround View optional equipment (OE 5DL) is only available in conjunction with the rear view camera 
optional equipment (OE 3AG). 

Panorama View is part of the Surround View optional equipment (OE 5DL). 

The rear view camera is available as standard equipment (OE 3AG). 


15.1. Surround view 

The Surround View optional equipment (OE 5DL) shows the vehicle surroundings and displays them 
in TOP View and 3D View on the central information display. 

The system comprises the front camera, the two cameras integrated in the exterior mirrors, the rear 
view camera (RFK) and the top rear side view camera (TRSVC) control unit. The cameras record 
the area from various, selectable angles and send this information to the TRSVC control unit via 
Ethernet. The images from the four cameras are combined into a panorama view around the vehicle 
from different angles using 3D computer graphics. The video signals are transmitted from the TRSVC 
control unit via an Ethernet line to the head unit. From there the video signal is transmitted to the 
central information display via an Automotive Pixel Link line. The driver can choose from preset views 
or can freely select the view (for example towbar zoom and car wash entrances). 

In addition, assistance functions such as guidance lines can be shown on the central information 
display.

The following camera angles can be displayed: 

• Automatic camera angle 

• Side view 

• Front camera 

• Panorama View 

• Reversing camera 

• Moving camera angle 


15.1.1. Automatic camera angle 

The system automatically shows the most appropriate camera angle depending on the driving 
situation, thus providing the driver with optimum assistance when parking and maneuvering. The 
automatic camera angle shows a steering-dependent view and takes into account the respective 
direction of travel and the distance information from the Park Distance Control (PDC). 

As soon as obstacles are detected, the view changes to a fixed display of the area in front of or behind 
the vehicle, or changes to the corresponding side view if required. 


15.1.2. Side view 

This view helps the driver to position the vehicle next to the curb or other obstacles at the side 
of the vehicle by displaying the side surroundings. The side view is from the rear to the front and 
automatically focuses on potential obstacles if there is a collision risk. 

Both the left and right sides of the vehicle are recorded. 

15.1.3. Front camera 

The front camera supports the driver when parking and maneuvering. The area in front of the vehicle 
is recorded by the front camera and shown on the central information display. The front camera view 
cannot be selected separately. The driver must select the "Auto" camera angle to view it or if desired, 
switch on the "Panorama View" function (see next section).

15.1.4. Panorama View 


Panorama View enables the driver to see the cross traffic at blind exits and Intersections before 
proceeding and provides the driver with optimum assistance in this situation. Road users that are 
hidden by obstacles to the side of the vehicle are sometimes only seen by the driver very late or not at 
all. To improve the view, the front and rearview cameras record the lateral roadway area. Depending on 
which drive position is engaged, the front or rearview camera can be activated.

When the moving camera angle is selected, a circular trajectory is shown around the vehicle on the 
central information display. Predetermined angles can be selected on the circular trajectory by turning 
the controller or using the touch function. 

In vehicles with the gesture control optional equipment (OE 6U8), the moving camera angle can also 
be controlled in this way. 

The current angle is identified by a camera symbol. Depending on the view, the surroundings of the 
vehicle or a partial area of the surroundings are shown on the central information display.

If required, the driver can receive additional assistance from the "Car wash" functions. 


15.3.1. Car wash view 

The car wash view assists the driver when entering a car wash. When the car wash view is selected, 
immediately before entering the car wash, a bird's eye view is displayed on the central information 
display. To enable the driver to align the vehicle more easily, at the same time the vehicle's tire tracks 
are shown on the display.

15.3.2. Side protection 

The side protection warns against obstacles at the side of the vehicle and thus supports the driver 
when parking and maneuvering. 

To protect the sides of the vehicle from collisions with obstacles, additional obstacle markings are 
shown to the side of the vehicle on the central information display if necessary, these obstacles are 
tracked by the nearest camera.

15.3.3. Door opening angle 

When the vehicle is stopped and the selector lever position "P" is engaged, the maximum opening 
angle of the doors is displayed on the central information display. 

If there is an obstacle near the door and it is detected by the side protection, this is marked on the 
central information display. The obstacle marking display only points out objects in the area of 
the door. It is not possible for a view from the camera systems to be displayed, as the door area is 
simulated. Therefore, the driver is only informed that there is an object at the side of the vehicle; it is 
not certain that the door will definitely collide with the identified object. The driver must judge this for 
himself.

The camera systems do not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic 
situation. There is still a risk of an accident. The driver's driving style should be adapted to the traffic 
conditions. The driver should check the traffic conditions and the vehicle's surroundings by looking 
around and react accordingly if required.

15.4.1. Reversing camera 

The rear view camera supports the driver when parking and maneuvering. The area behind the vehicle 
is shown on the central information display. Guidance lines integrated in the image provide the driver 
with additional assistance with distances, the turning circle and obstacle markings function, if required. 

The driving lane lines are dependent on the steering angle and are continually adjusted when steering 
wheel movements are made. 

The turning circle lines can only be shown in the rear view camera image in conjunction with the 
driving lane lines. The turning circle lines show the shape of the smallest possible turning circle 
on an even roadway. From a certain steering-wheel angle, only one turning circle line is shown. 

The rear view camera is located in the tailgate handle strip.

G12 rear view camera 

The control unit is integrated in the rear view camera and is the bus user at K-CAN3. The video signals 
are transmitted directly to the Head Unit High 2 (HU-H2) via a CVBS line. An Ethernet connection for 
the rear view camera (on non 5DL cars) is being planned for a later version. 

In vehicles with the Surround View optional equipment (OE 5DL) a rear view camera without an 
integrated control unit is installed. The reversing camera is connected to the TRSVC control unit via 
Ethernet in vehicles with Surround View (SA 5DL). 

15.4.2. TRSVC control unit 

The exterior cameras record the area around the vehicle from various angles and send this information 
to the TRSVC control unit via Ethernet. The video signals are transmitted from the TRSVC control 
unit to the head unit via an Ethernet line. The head unit transmits the signals to the central information 
display via an Automotive Pixel Link line. 

The installation location of the TRSVC control unit is in the footwell on the driver's side.

Park Distance Control (PDC) assists the driver when maneuvering in and out of a parking space. 
The current distance from an obstruction is indicated by acoustic signals and on a visual display. 



G12 Park Distance Control (PDC) view on the CID 


The front and rear Park Distance Control (OE 508) is included in the G12 standard equipment. 

The distance from an obstruction is measured by four ultrasonic sensors in the rear bumper 
panel and four additional ultrasonic sensors in the front bumper panel.

Vehicles that do not have the Parking Maneuver Assistant but do have the Park Distance Control have 
a separate control unit, which is recognized as the PMA control unit by diagnosis and is also referred 
to by this name in the bus diagram. In other words, there is no longer a difference in the naming of the 
PDC and PMA control unit (there are however differences in the hardware design between the control 
units and the software is adapted to the equipment specification). 



G12 control unit for Parking Maneuver Assistant (PMA) 


16.2. Auto PDC 

Automatic activation of the Park Distance Control not only with drive position "R" engaged, but also 
with "D" engaged, has been implemented in the G12. 

Auto PDC is also activated automatically if the vehicle is approaching an object at a speed below 
approximately 5 km/h. 

Use case: 

The driver is driving along a road at approximately 50 km/h and after some time approaches an 
entrance gate on the right-hand side of the road. The entrance gate is 2.80 m wide and there is a wall 
on each side of it. The vehicle turns right to drive into the entrance gate. Let us assume that in this 
example space is very restricted and given the difficult curve radius the vehicle is approaching the left- 
hand wall of the entrance gate at a distance of less than approximately 0.6 m. In this case, the Park 
Distance Control would be activated automatically, if on approaching the wall the speed of the vehicle 
does not exceed approximately 4 km/h. 

The Park Distance Control is activated automatically, if: 


86 













G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

16. Park Distance Control 


• there is an object closer than 0.6 m from the front of the vehicle when driving forwards 

• there is an object closer than 1.5 m from the rear of the vehicle when reversing 

• the speed driven does not exceed approximately 4 km/h 

The PDC view is automatically displayed on the central information display. The activation distance of 
the Park Distance Control depends on the respective situation and therefore may vary. 

A sound is only output if the detected object (in front of or behind the vehicle) is directly in the lane 
(risk of collision). If the detected object is not directly in the lane, there is only visual acknowledgement 
on the central information display.

3 Detection of obstacle by the ultrasonic sensors 

If an object has been detected by Auto PDC, the system must be reactivated so that it cannot be 
accidentally switched on, for example in a carwash. Reactivation is effected by: 

• driving speed > 5 km/h 

• drive position change 

If a drive position change is made into neutral, the Park Distance Control is not activated automatically, 
again to avoid it being switched on, for example in a car wash. 

The automatic switch-on function when obstacles are detected can be switched on and off via iDrive. 


87 








G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

16. Park Distance Control 

16.3. Active Park Distance Control 

In G12 vehicles with the Parking Maneuver Assistant optional equipment (OE 5DP), the Park Distance 
Control function has been extended to include the active Park Distance Control function. This 
automatically brakes the vehicle to a halt when it is travelling at walking speed (< approximately 6 km/ 
h) if an object is detected behind the vehicle. 

If the accelerator pedal is pressed and an obstacle is detected, the brakes are preconditioned and 
gentle initial braking is initiated as a warning for the driver. If the accelerator pedal is not pressed and 
the vehicle is very close to the obstacle, the function brakes the vehicle with the maximum possible 
brake force until it comes to a standstill. This can potentially avoid a collision or reduce the damage. 

The automatic brake intervention can be overridden at any time by pressing the accelerator pedal. 
Consequently, after the vehicle is automatically braked to a standstill, it is possible to continue to 
approach the obstruction by gently pressing the accelerator pedal. 

The active Park Distance Control function can be switched on and off via iDrive. 

If the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is switched off, then the active Park Distance Control is also 
deactivated. If the active Park Distance Control is switched on when the Dynamic Stability Control is 
switched off, the DSC is automatically switched on at the same time. 

A 

The system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic 
situation. The driver should check the traffic conditions and the vehicle's surroundings by looking 
around and react accordingly if required. 


16.4. Side protection 

Vehicles with the Parking Maneuver Assistant optional equipment (OE 5DP) have side protection. 
Obstacles that are detected by the four side ultrasonic sensors integrated in the bumpers can be 
displayed by the Park Distance Control system.

It is not able to detect whether an obstacle has since moved. For this reason, the markings on the 
display are shown in grey after the vehicle has been stationary for roughly 13 seconds. 

More information on the side protection function can be found in section 18.6.

16.5.3. Acoustic signal output 

The driver is notified about the results of the distance measurements and the distance warnings 
acoustically via the audio speakers and optically via the central information display (CID). As the 
vehicle approaches an object, the corresponding position is indicated by an intermittent tone from the 
audio speaker. If, for example, an object is detected behind the vehicle to the left, the rear left speaker 
emits an acoustic signal. A continuous alarm sounds when the object is about 25 cm or less away. The 
volume of the acoustic signal of the Park Distance Control system can be adjusted in relation to the 
audio playback of the entertainment system.

16.6. Deactivation criteria 

Similar to other BMW models, the deactivation is distance-/speed-based. The switch-off is effected 
after a journey of about 50 m or at a speed over 36 km/h. 

If a fault develops, a Check Control message ("PDC has malfunctioned. Have system checked.") is 
displayed in the central information display (CID). In addition, the detection range of the sensors is 
shown shaded in the central information display (CID). 


92 












G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

16. Park Distance Control 

16.7. Limits of the system 

Due to the physical limits during the ultrasonic measurement, obstructions may not be detected by the 
Park Distance Control system. Several examples of this are shown below: 

• if the objects are thin or wedge-shaped 

• when the objects are low 

• when objects that, due to their shape, have corners and sharp edges 

• with snow 

• if the objects have a porous surface. 

A warning may also be displayed although there is no obstruction in the detection range. This may be 
the case in the following situations: 

• when it is raining heavily 

• if the sensors are heavily soiled or iced over 

• if the sensors are covered with snow 

• if the street surface is rough 

• if there are bumps, e.g. speed bumps 

• in large right-angled buildings with smooth walls, e.g. underground car parks 

• due to heavy exhaust gas fumes 

• due to other ultrasound sources. 

To ensure the ultrasonic sensors remain fully operational, they must be kept clean and free of ice. 

When cleaning the sensors using a high pressure cleaner, avoid direct and sustained contact with a 
high-pressure water jet. Furthermore, when using high pressure cleaners, a distance of at least 30 cm 
from the sensors must be maintained. 

A_ 

The Park Distance Control cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the traffic situation. Also 
check the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking around, otherwise there may be a risk of an 
accident as a result of road users or objects which lie outside the detection range of the Park Distance 
Control. Loud sound sources outside and inside the vehicle could drown out the PDC signal. 


93 






G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

17. Cross-Traffic Warning 

The cross-traffic warning is used for the first time in the G12. This warning assists the driver when 
maneuvering out of a parking space and in other everyday situations where it is difficult to see the 
traffic, such as at blind entrances and exits. 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, the cross-traffic warning is available for the front and rear. 

The system can detect objects that are approaching the vehicle from the side, either from the front or 
rear (depending on the vehicle equipment). The driver is made aware or, if necessary, warned of cross 
traffic by the cross-traffic warning when maneuvering out of a parking space or entering the cross 
traffic. 


17.1. Functional principle 

If a moving object is detected, which based on the current speed would be in the area in front of or 
behind the vehicle in approximately the next three seconds, a visual and acoustic warning is issued. 

When a rear cross-traffic warning is issued, the LED in the mirror glass is also switched on. The Blind 
spot detection signal unit is used as an indicator. The indicator is switched on in either the left or right 
mirror depending on the direction from which the object is approaching the vehicle. 

The cross-traffic warning works up to a speed of approximately 7 km/h. Another prerequisite of the 
function is that the side radar sensors are able to detect the road or approaching object. The radar 
sensors can detect objects up to approximately 30 to 40 m away from the vehicle. 



G12 cross-traffic warning example: maneuvering out of a parking space 

Depending on the vehicle equipment, different versions of the cross-traffic warning and displays on 
the central information display are available. 


94 









G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

17. Cross-Traffic Warning 

17.2. Rear cross-traffic warning 

The rear cross-traffic warning assists the driver when reversing out of a parking space and warns of 
potential collisions with cross traffic in traffic situations where it is difficult to see obstructions. 

The rear cross-traffic warning function is included in the Active Driving Assistant (OE 5AS) 
optional equipment. 

The warning is displayed in the Park Distance Control image on the central information display. 

In conjunction with the rear view camera optional equipment (OE 3AG), the rear cross-traffic warning 
will be extended to include an additional display on the central information display in a later version. 
The warning will be shown in the form of a red bar in the camera's video screen. 

The rear cross-traffic warning is enabled if the driver engages the "R" drive position or the Park 
Distance Control is active. 

In vehicles with the Surround View optional equipment (OE 5DL), the rear cross-traffic warning is also 
enabled if Panorama View has been activated. 

The rear cross-traffic warning is available at speeds from 0 to approximately 7 km/h. 


17.3. Front cross-traffic warning 

The front cross-traffic warning assists the driver when entering the cross traffic from exits and blind 
Intersections. 

The front cross-traffic warning is included in the Active Driving Assistant Plus (OE 5AT) 
optional equipment. If the cross-traffic warning for the front of the vehicle is installed, the rear 
version is activated automatically. 

The warning is displayed in the Park Distance Control image on the central information display. 

The front cross-traffic warning is enabled if the Park Distance Control is active and the speed of the 
vehicle does not exceed approximately 7 km/h. 

In vehicles with the Surround View optional equipment (OE 5DL), the front cross-traffic warning is also 
enabled if Panorama View has been activated. 

Like the rear cross-traffic warning, the front cross-traffic warning function is available at speeds from 0 
to approximately 7 km/h.

If the cross-traffic warning has been activated in the Drive menu, the function is switched on 
automatically as soon as the Park Distance Control or Panorama View is active. 


The cross-traffic warning is deactivated automatically in the following situations: 

• if the driver's vehicle is travelling at a speed higher than walking speed (threshold value 
approximately 7 km/h) 

• if the steering and lane control assistant is active 

• if the driver is currently parking using the Parking Maneuver Assistant 

17.6. Limits of the system 

The function may be restricted in the following situations: 

• if there are other objects in the field of view of the sensors that are concealing the cross traffic 

• In heavy fog, rain or snow 

• if the bumper is dirty or iced up 

• if stickers have been attached near the radar sensors on the bumper 

• if the speed of the approaching vehicle is very high 

• if crossing objects are moving very slowly 

• on sharp bends 

If a trailer socket is being used, for example to operate a trailer or bicycle carrier, the cross-traffic 
warning is not available for the area behind the vehicle.

18. Parking Maneuver Assistant 

The Parking Maneuver Assistant PMA supports the driver in many ways. The assistant measures the 
size of a gap between cars and decides based on the result whether the gap is large enough on the 
one hand and relieves the driver of the task of maneuvering into the space on the other. The Parking 
Maneuver Assistant (OE 5DP) is optional equipment in the G12 and can only be ordered in conjunction 
with the rear view camera optional equipment (OE 3AG) and its offered as part of the ZDB - Driver 
Assistance Plus (5AS) package. 


18.1. System components 

Below is an overview of important sensors and operating elements: 

• The parking assistance button is the central control panel for the Parking Maneuver Assistant 
function (position 8). 

• Two additional ultrasonic sensors in the front bumper measure parking spaces while driving 
(position 1). 

• The distance from an obstruction is measured by four ultrasonic sensors in the rear bumper 
panel and four additional ultrasonic sensors in the front bumper panel (positions 11 and 19). 

• Two additional ultrasonic sensors are installed in the rear bumper to precisely detect the size 
of a transverse parking space during the parking maneuver. The additional ultrasonic sensors 
measure the distance to detected objects.

18.3. Control unit 

In vehicles with the Parking Maneuver Assistant optional equipment (OE 5DP), the Park Distance 
Control and Parking Maneuver Assistant functions are provided by the PMA control unit. 



G12 control unit for Parking Maneuver Assistant (PMA) 


18.4. Functional principle 

The Parking Maneuver Assistant function facilitates maneuvering into parking spaces that are parallel 
(parallel parking) and perpendicular (bay parking) to the roadway. The system measures potential 
parking spaces when driving past at a speed below approximately 35 km/h without the system having 
been activated. 

The parking spaces are measured by two additional ultrasonic sensors, which are integrated into the 
front wheel arch. These two sensors are connected to the Parking Maneuver Assistant (PMA) control 
unit, which also incorporates the Park Distance Control function. The function of the two ultrasonic 
sensors is similar to that of the Park Distance Control PDC. Ultrasonic pulses are sent and echo 
impulses are received. 

Two additional ultrasonic sensors are installed in the rear bumper of the G12 to precisely detect the 
size of a transverse parking space during the parking maneuver. The additional ultrasonic sensors 
measure the distance to detected objects. 

If a parking space of a sufficient length and width is found and the system is activated, the driver is 
shown the space on the central information display. 

The Parking Maneuver Assistant function then takes over the vehicle handling entirely, including 
steering, braking and gear selection. 

Spaces that do not have a vehicle at either side are also recognized as suitable parking spaces. This 
makes it possible to park behind only one object. 

The driver is still responsible for monitoring the vehicle environment and can intervene in the 
automatic parking maneuver at any time if required due to the vehicle environment. When 
searching for a parking space and when parking, all relevant information is presented to the driver 
in an integrated display; from the parking space itself to the status of the parking assistant and 
corresponding handling instructions through to distances from other objects. 


104 






G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

18. Parking Maneuver Assistant 

Personal responsibility: 

• Directly monitor gaps and the parking procedure and intervene if necessary, as otherwise 
there is a risk of accidents. 

• If a parking space that has already been measured changes, the system does not take this into 
account. 

• The system does not take loads that project above the vehicle into account during parking. 

• The Parking Maneuver Assistant PMA may steer the vehicle over or up onto curbs. You should 
therefore use the facility for active intervention at any time with caution as you may otherwise 
damage wheels and tires or the vehicle itself. 


A 

The Parking Maneuver Assistant PMA does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility during 
parking. Therefore, be attentive in order to be able to actively intervene at any time. Otherwise, there is 
a risk of an accident. 


18.5. Functional prerequisites 

To use the Parking Maneuver Assistant function, the following basic prerequisites must be met: 

• the doors must be closed 

• the tailgate must be closed 

• the driver's seat belt must be fastened 

• the parking brake must be released 

18.5.1. Measuring parking spaces 

Parking spaces are measured while driving. The following parameters apply: 

• Driving forwards straight-ahead up to about 35 km/h 

• Maximum distance to the row of parked vehicles: 1.5 m. 

Detecting the curb 

If a curb is detected within the range of the ultrasonic sensor while the system is searching for a 
parking space, the parking space is for the most a space that is parallel to the road. 

In the case of parking spaces that are perpendicular to the roadway, the curb is usually outside the 
detection range of the ultrasonic sensors (range about 4.2 m).

18.5.4. Detection of a universal parking space 

Due to the technical system limits, the vehicle does not always detect the correct parking space. 
Situations may occur where parking spaces are wrongly detected, or parking spaces that are 
unsuitable or not actually classed as parking spaces are detected. 

The below graphic shows a situation where this may be the case. 



G12 detection of a universal parking space 


The detected parking space is big enough to park the vehicle in both perpendicularly and parallel to 
the roadway. Because of the absence of a curb, the vehicle cannot correctly determine the parking 
space. The vehicle proposes a universal parking space. In this case, the driver must decide how he 
wants to maneuver into the parking space. 


The following display appears on the central information display when the vehicle has detected a 
universal parking space.

18.6. Side protection 

The side protection warns against obstacles at the side of the vehicle and thus supports the driver 
when parking and maneuvering. 



G12 side protection 


Four side ultrasonic sensors, two integrated in the front bumper and two integrated in the rear bumper, 
measure the distance to an obstruction. Obstructions detected by the sensors are tracked along the 
side of the vehicle as it moves. They are shown on the central information display and, in situations 
where a collision is imminent, an acoustic warning also sounds. 


112 





G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

18. Parking Maneuver Assistant 



G12 side protection view on the CID 


Obstructions approaching the stationary vehicle are not taken into account, as in this case the system 
cannot evaluate the situation unequivocally. The prerequisite for identifying obstructions is that the 
(driver's) vehicle is moving. 


The distance markings shown on the central information display are displayed for approximately 

13 seconds once the vehicle has stopped. The markings are only shown again once the vehicle starts 

moving. 


18.7. Operation 

There are two ways to activate the Parking Maneuver Assistant function: 

• Activation via parking assistance button 

• Activation by "Engaging reverse gear" followed by "Drive controller operation" 

Activation via parking assistance button 

When the PMA is activated via the parking assistance button in the center console the parking 
assistance menu in the Central Information Display CID is displayed. As soon as a parking space is 
found, the driver receives handling instructions that guide him though the parking procedure with the 
support of the system. When parking automatically, the driver must hold down the parking assistance 
button until the parking procedure is complete.

Activation by "Engaging reverse gear" followed by "iDrive controller operation" 

When reverse gear is engaged, the Parking Maneuver Assistant menu is displayed on the central 
information display accompanied by the status of the parking space search. The Parking Maneuver 
Assistant (PMA) is however not yet activated. This is indicated to the driver by the Parking Maneuver 
Assistant symbol in the toolbar of the central information display. In order to park supported by the 
system, the parking operation must be activated via the controller by selecting the corresponding 
symbol in the symbol bar at the Central Information Display (CID). When parking automatically, the 
driver must hold down the parking assistance button until the parking procedure is complete. 

18.7.1. Parking procedure (parallel parking) 

A check mark then appears on the right below the Parking Maneuver Assistant symbol on the central 
information display to tell the driver that Parking Maneuver Assistant is active. 

If the Parking Maneuver Assistant function is activated during the journey using the parking assistance 
button, the driver is informed about the parking space search on the CID. When a parking space is 
found, it appears on the corresponding page on the central information display. The driver is also 
instructed to stop the vehicle at the same time.

18.7.3. Deactivation criteria 

Manual deactivation criteria 

The Parking Maneuver Assistant PMA can be deactivated at any time if necessary by the driver via 
the controller by selecting the corresponding symbol in the symbol bar on the Central Information 
Display CID. Another way to deactivate the Parking Maneuver Assistant PMA is to release the parking 
assistance button in the switch block next to the iDrive controller. 

If a fault develops, a Check Control message ("The PDC has malfunctioned. Have system checked.") is 
displayed in the Central Information Display CID. 

Automatic deactivation criteria 

The Parking Maneuver Assistant PMA is switched off automatically when the following events occur: 

• the parking assistance button is released 

• the driver holds on to the steering wheel or steers himself 

• a gear is selected that does not correspond to the instruction on the control display 

• when accelerating 

• the parking brake is secured 

• the turn indicator opposite the required parking side is switched on 

• at speeds above about 10 km/h 

• possibly if the roadway is covered with snow or is slippery 

• the tailgate is open 

• possibly if the objects are difficult to overcome, e.g. curbs 

• if obstructions suddenly appear 

• a maximum number of parking maneuvers or the parking duration has been exceeded. 


18.8. Limits of the system 

The detection of objects can test the ultrasonic measurement system to its limits. Several examples of 
this are shown below: 

• with trailer towbars and couplings 

• if the objects are thin or wedge-shaped 

• if the objects are projecting and elevated, e.g. wall projections or loads 

• if the objects have corners and sharp edges 

• if the objects have fine surfaces or structures, e.g. fences. 

Low objects that are already displayed, e.g. curbs, may fall within the blind spot of the sensors before 
or after a continuous alarm sounds. It would not be possible to detect objects that are higher up and 
projecting, e.g. wall projections. Parking spaces may be detected although these are not suitable. 


118 





G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

18. Parking Maneuver Assistant 

There may be other functional limitations in the following situations, for example: 

• if the sensors are soiled or iced up 

• in heavy fog, rain or snow 

• on uneven surfaces, e.g. gravel roads 

• on slippery surfaces 

• on steep inclines or downhill gradients 

• if leaves have gathered or snow has piled up in the parking space. 

To ensure the ultrasonic sensors remain fully operational, they must be kept clean and free of ice. 
When cleaning the sensors using a high pressure cleaner, avoid direct and sustained contact with a 
high-pressure water jet. Furthermore, when using high pressure cleaners, a distance of at least 30 cm 
from the sensors must be maintained. 

A_ 

The Parking Maneuver Assistant PMA cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the traffic 
situation. Also check the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking around, otherwise there may 
be a risk of an accident as a result of road users or objects which lie outside the detection range of 
the Park Distance Control. Loud sound sources outside and inside the vehicle may mask the acoustic 
signals of the Parking Maneuver Assistant PMA or the Park Distance Control PDC. 


119 





G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

19. Cruise Control 

19.1. Introduction 

Two cruise control functions can be used in the G12. The cruise control with braking function (DCC) 
is part of the basic equipment. 

The customer also has the option of ordering the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function 
(ACC Stop&Go) optional equipment (OE ZN7) part of ZDT Driver Assistance Plus II. 

ACC Stop&Go can also be obtained if the customer opts for the Active Driving Assistant Plus optional 
equipment (OE 5AT), as it is contained in this equipment package. 

Other features of the Active Driving Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT) are the steering and 
lane control assistant and the traffic jam assistant. When used in conjunction with the steering and 
lane control assistant and the traffic jam assistant, ACC Stop & Go provides optimum support for the 
driver. 

A 

The cruise control systems support the driver with adapting the speed, distance and driving style to 
the traffic conditions, but do not relieve him of his responsibility. The driver must actively intervene, 
e.g. by braking, steering or taking evasive action, as otherwise there is a risk of an accident. 


19.2. Cruise control with braking function 

The cruise control with braking function is included as part of the G12's basic equipment. The system 
is also Known as "Dynamic Cruise Control" (DCC). Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) supports the driver 
on roads with less traffic by keeping the speed constant irrespective of rolling resistances (incline, 
downhill driving and vehicle load). In spite of the support, the driver remains responsible for control 
of the vehicle. It is possible to override the DCC function at any time by braking or accelerating the 
vehicle. 


19.2.1. Control functions 

Cruise control 

The cruise control calculates a target acceleration or deceleration based on the speed set by the driver 
and the actual speed. 

Acceleration and deceleration 

The driver can specify the set speed or acceleration via the rocker switch on the multifunction steering 
wheel (MFL). 

Cruise control on bends 

Another purpose of this function, also referred to as the "lateral acceleration controller", is to prevent 
the lateral acceleration from increasing above an acceptable level when cornering with the cruise 
control switched on. A lateral acceleration is calculated from the driving speed and yaw rate. This value 
is compared with a speed-dependent limit in order to achieve the following seemingly contradictory 
objectives: 


120 




G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

19. Cruise Control 


• Disruptive and overly restrictive interventions are avoided if the driver himself would also prefer 
high lateral acceleration. 

• Useful interventions and therefore also significant limitations in dynamics are effected at high 
speeds. Most drivers find an overly high lateral acceleration in these situations unpleasant, 
which is why a lower limit value is used. 

The output variable for the cornering cruise control is also used as a set-point value for the longitudinal 
acceleration. 

Prioritization of the partial set-point value 

The set-point value with the highest priority according to the situation is selected from the longitudinal 
acceleration set-point values for the control functions referred to above. Signals are filtered to prevent 
abrupt jumps when adjusting the set-point values. 

Estimation of disturbance force 

An acceleration or brake force must be calculated in order to be able to apply the prioritized 
longitudinal acceleration with the assistance of the actuators. Example: more driving power is required 
to achieve the same longitudinal acceleration during an uphill journey than on the flat. If the vehicle 
needs to decelerate when travelling up hill, less braking force is required compared to driving on the 
flat. In order to be able to correctly calculate the forces required, the precise value of the gradient and 
also the weight of the vehicle, the rolling resistance, the drag and other acceleration forces must be 
known. As a sensor system that can monitor all of these disturbances does not exist, an estimated 
value is calculated instead by comparing the following two variables: 

• actual movement variables of the vehicle 

• anticipated movement variables of the vehicle as a result of the driving power and braking 
forces currently acting on the vehicle. 

The extent of the disturbing force determined using this method is taken into account during 
subsequent processing of the longitudinal acceleration setpoint value by means of addition or 
subtraction. 


19.2.2. Activation of the actuators 

Driving power and/or braking forces must be introduced in order to produce the longitudinal 
acceleration calculated by the control functions and thus compensate for disturbing forces acting 
on the vehicle. To accelerate the vehicle, a setpoint value for the drive is usually transmitted. In 
exceptional cases during downhill driving on a steep gradient, it may be necessary to activate the brake 
to ensure the acceleration does not exceed a specific value. 

If the vehicle needs to be decelerated, the extent of the contribution that may be required by the drive 
towards the deceleration, and therefore the braking effect of the engine and transmission, is initially 
determined. This value is output to the Digital Motor Electronics (DME) or and electronic transmission 
control (EGS). If this value cannot be achieved by the drivetrain alone, the additional amount required is 
transmitted to the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). 

The vehicle's brake lights are also switched on if the brakes are noticeably actuated in order to 
produce the desired deceleration. 


121 



G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

19. Cruise Control 


19.2.3. Operation 

The driver has the option of adjusting the set speed in small or large increments, which is then set and 
maintained by the system by controlling the drive and brakes. It can be changed using the left-hand 
switch block on the multifunction steering wheel (MFL). The speed is increased or reduced by 1 km/ 
h by tapping the rocker switch. Each time the rocker button is pressed beyond the pressure point, the 
speed increases or reduces by 10 km/h. The DCC steadily maintains a selected speed from about 
30 km/h. 

The set speed is indicated in the instrument cluster KOMBI in the familiar way; by a mark that moves 
round the speed reading. Notes are added to the displays in the instrument cluster if necessary. 

If the vehicle's own deceleration is not sufficient to maintain the preset speed, the brake is activated 
accordingly. 

The adjustment range for the set speed is limited to a maximum of 210 km/h. 

If ECO PRO or SPORT mode is activated, the cruise control is also set to a fuel-efficient or sporty 
driving style. Due to the fuel-efficient driving style in ECO PRO driving mode, in some situations the 
vehicle's speed may exceed or drop below the set speed, for example on downhill gradients or inclines.

• If the selector lever position is moved out of position "D" 

• If the Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) is activated or the Dynamic Stability Control 
(DSC) is deactivated 

• If the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is performing an adjustment 


19.3. Active cruise control with Stop&Go function 

The active cruise control with Stop&Go function, ACC Stop&Go (OE 5DF) is offered as optional 
equipment for the G12 as part of the ZDB Driver Assistance Plus II (5AT) package. 

ACC Stop&Go adjusts a driver-specified set speed and, if required by the traffic situation, also 
automatically adjusts the preselected following distance to the vehicle driving ahead (detected 
vehicles include passenger cars, trucks and motorbikes). The application range of ACC Stop&Go 
ranges from higher speeds down to a standstill. The distance and the speed are automatically 
adjusted in this range. 



G12 Active Cruise Control 

Depending on the stationary time, driving off from a standstill is performed automatically or in 
response to a prompt by the driver. ACC Stop&Go not only detects vehicles that are slowly coming 
to a halt, but also stationary vehicles. 

Due to improved monitoring in front of the vehicle, the system is capable of reacting more quickly 
to vehicles swinging in and out and turning off. 

The extended application range has been achieved by the incorporation of the KAFAS stereo camera. 
Image data is evaluated by the ACC Stop&Go system. The KAFAS control unit clearly detects vehicles 
when their rear ends are recorded by the camera. In addition, the KAFAS control unit ensures that the 
driving lane information, vehicle positions and movements are determined. 


In addition to image data, radar data is also gathered and evaluated by the radar sensors. This fusion 
of image and radar data makes possible the clear identification of lane markings and the distinction 
between stationary vehicles and other fixed objects. 


123 




G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

19. Cruise Control 



Object detection provided by a combination of radar sensor and KAFAS stereo camera 


A 77 GHz radar sensor emits bundled electromagnetic waves. The echoes reflected by objects are 
received and evaluated by the radar sensor. This enables information about objects located in front of 
the radar sensor to be obtained. This information includes size, distance and the deduced speed. The 
radar sensor of the system can identify vehicles ahead up to a distance of 200 m, to a large 
extent irrespective of weather conditions. 

The sensor is located behind the air inlet grille on the front bumper.

19. Cruise Control 


Thanks to the radar sensor's improved detection capability and alignment with the image data from 
the KAFAS stereo camera, vehicles in neighboring lanes are also detected. If these vehicles are driving 
in their own lane, then ACC Stop&Go adapts the speed to the vehicle pulling in or vehicle ahead. As a 
result, a time lag selected by the driver is constantly maintained. 

ACC Stop&Go adjusts the speed if there is no vehicle driving directly ahead and automatically 
switches to distance control if the sensor system detects a slower vehicle in its lane. The system's 
Stop & Go function brings the vehicle to a complete standstill if necessary. 

A_ 

If the vehicle ahead drives off again after a standstill, the driver is informed thereof with a note. 

To drive off again, the driver must acknowledge this information by pressing the RES/CNCL button or 
the accelerator pedal. Only if the duration of the standstill is very short (about 3 seconds) is the starting 
process effected fully automatically by ACC Stop&Go. 


In this way, ACC Stop & Go supports the driver not only in flowing traffic, but also in traffic jam 
situations, both on multiple-lane highways and ordinary roads and on urban arterial and ring roads. 

The adjustment range for the set speed is limited to a maximum of 210 km/h. 

If ECO PRO or SPORT mode is activated, the Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function is also 
set to a fuel-efficient or sporty driving style. Due to the fuel-efficient driving style in ECO PRO driving 
mode, in some situations the vehicle's speed may exceed or drop below the set speed, for example on 
downhill gradients or inclines. 

19.3.1. Control functions 

The calculations are performed in the optional equipment control unit SAS. 

Cruise control 

In principle, the cruise control in the ACC Stop&Go system works in exactly the same way as the 
Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) system. 

Cruise control on bends 

The cruise control of the ACC Stop&Go on bends is based on the control characteristics of the 
Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC). If an object is lost on bends, the system waits to see whether the 
object reappears (transition curve). The vehicle only accelerates if it does not reappear or the sensor 
system no longer detects an object. Tight bends are detected via the data of the Dynamic Stability 
Control system DSC and the navigation system and the speed adjusted if necessary. 

Distance control (ranging) 

The distance control is the core function of the ACC Stop&Go system. 

The driver can select a desired distance in four stages using the multifunction button on the 
multifunction steering wheel (MFL). From this preselection ACC Stop&Go calculates the reference 
distance to the vehicle driving ahead for the control. In vehicles with the Active Cruise Control optional 


126 




G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

19. Cruise Control 


equipment (OE 5DF), the distance is adjusted using two buttons; one to reduce and one to increase 
the distance. In vehicles with the Driving Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT), the distance is 
adjusted using the rocker button. 

ACC Stop&Go calculates the reference distance for the control from this preselection. The following 
distance most recently selected is saved depending on the key being used. 

The reference distance during the journey is proportional to the driving speed. At a lower driving speed 
and at standstill, the proportional distance to the driving speed is no longer used for the ACC Stop & 
Go, but a fixed value in metres. 

If a vehicle moves into the driver's lane, which is anticipated due to the current driving condition, or 
if the driver is approaching a vehicle driving ahead, the ACC Stop&Go function discretely adapts the 
speed to the vehicle pulling in or vehicle ahead. 

The distance control uses the prepared object data with the highest diagnostic statistic as input 
variables. The distance control takes into consideration the following situations in particular: 

• Maximum values for acceleration and deceleration: 

The maximum values for acceleration and deceleration of the ACC Stop&Go system below 
about 50 km/h are dynamic values. They correspond to the acceleration and deceleration 
values that the driver would use himself and considers comfortable. In situations where 
sharper deceleration is required than the system offers as part of the speed adjustment 
feature, a visual and acoustic signal is issued to the driver to inform him to take over vehicle 
handling. 

Depending on the situation, the ACC Stop & Go accelerates by a maximum of about 2 m/s 2 
and decelerates by a maximum of about 4 m/s 2 . 

* Stop and start stability: 

In the case of very heavy traffic and very low driving speed, the risk of rear-end collisions 
increases through heavy acceleration and braking. The ACC Stop&Go distance controller is 
therefore designed to decelerate as early as possible, but not more than the vehicle ahead. 

The system can decelerate by up to 2.5 m/s 2 at the most during subsequent operation, and by 
up to 4 m/s 2 at the most when stopping. 


Request to take over vehicle handling 

When ACC Stop&Go is no longer able to maintain a safe distance or a critical situation is detected, 
e.g. on account of very high differential speeds or an insufficient maximum deceleration, two short 
warning signals sound and the orange lit up vehicle symbol in the instrument cluster or the Head-Up 
Display (optional equipment OE 610) flashes. The system continues to perform its control function 
and prompts the driver to take over vehicle handling and to keep their distance accordingly. 

19.3.2. Operation 

Activation and deactivation 

The activation and deactivation of the ACC Stop & Go and the Dynamic Cruise Control are almost the 
same. ACC Stop&Go can either be activated while driving or at a standstill. For safety reasons, when 
the vehicle is at a standstill the function can only be put in Standby mode or deactivated while the 
footbrake is applied.

If the function is active, it can be interrupted by pressing the RES/CNCL button. The distance and 
speed will no longer be maintained and the set speed is greyed out in the instrument cluster. 

The driver can select a desired distance in four stages using the left-hand multifunction button on the 
multifunction steering wheel (MFL). The last selected following distance is saved depending on the 
key being used. 

• The following graphic shows the button assignment for the assistance systems on the

• Engine running 

• Parking brake not activated 

• Camera and radar sensor operational 

• No system faults detected. 


128

19. Cruise Control 


The system is interrupted automatically in the following situations: 

• If the brakes are used 

• If the selector lever position is moved out of position "D" 

• If the Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) is activated or the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is 
deactivated 

• If the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is performing an adjustment 

• If the seat belt is unfastened and the driver's door is opened in a stationary vehicle 

• If the system has not detected an object for a long time, e.g. on rarely frequented 
sections of road with no distinct edge 

• If the detection range of the radar is impaired, e.g. due to contamination or heavy precipitation 

• Following a longer immobilization period, if the vehicle has been decelerated to a standstill 
by ACC Stop&Go. 

The set speed is indicated in the instrument cluster in the familiar way; by a mark that moves round 
the speed reading. If ACC Stop&Go is activated, this mark is green, whereas in "Standby" mode it is 
grey and the last set speed is displayed. After the ACC Stop&Go function is activated or after the driver 
has adjusted the set speed, the current digital value is displayed. If the distance is changed, a symbol 
appears briefly as an acknowledgement. The symbol screen masks are for example the set speed and 
the distance bar. With each subsequent operation the display is shown for another three seconds. 

The distances set by the driver, as well as the distances to any vehicles driving ahead, that must be 
maintained to ensure a safe distance are displayed between the two round instruments (speed reading 
and engine speed display). The distance setting is stored for the ID transmitter currently being used. 
Like for DCC, it is also necessary that the symbol screen masks are complemented if necessary with 
notes in the instrument cluster for ACC Stop & Go. 

With active control the displays are also shown in the Head-Up Display (optional equipment OE 610). 

If the system can no longer adjust a safe distance, for example due to very high differential speeds, 
then the driver is prompted to take over the vehicle handling by a flashing red vehicle symbol and an 
acoustic signal.

G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

22. Lane & Traffic Jam Assistant 


The lane keeping assistant with traffic jam assistant is part of the Active Driving Assistant Plus optional 
equipment (OE 5AT). 

The system assists the driver in keeping the vehicle in lane by initiating corrective steering 
interventions if required. 



G12 active steering intervention 


22.1. Functional principle 

Depending on the speed, the system is guided by the lane edges or vehicles driving ahead. The 
position of the lane edges and the vehicle driving ahead is determined with the help of five radar 
sensors and the KAFAS stereo camera.

22. Lane & Traffic Jam Assistant 


The system has two sub-functions: the traffic jam assistant (second generation) and the lane control 
assistant. 

The traffic jam assistant can be used within the speed range of 0 to 70 km/h, the lane control assistant 
on the other hand from 70 to 210 km/h. 

The table below shows an overview of the differences between the two sub-functions:

Gaps in lane markings can be bridged for a 
limited time by aligning with vehicle ahead 


If the traffic jam and lane control assistants are activated, the side collision warning is also interlinked. 

22.1.1. Hands-off-Detection 

To ensure the driver is alert and able to react, he is urged to always have both hands on the steering 
wheel when the steering and lane control assistant including traffic jam assistant are activated 
(established in the German road traffic regulations). If the driver takes both hands off the steering 
wheel rim, control is stopped after a few seconds during active control and the driver is requested to 
take over steering. 

A capacitive sensor (hands-off detection sensor) with corresponding touch detection electronics in 
the steering wheel determines whether the steering wheel is being touched. 

The electronic touch detection is installed in the steering wheel below the driver's airbag. 


138 





G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

22. Lane & Traffic Jam Assistant

The hands can only be detected on the steering wheel rim, not on the steering wheel spokes, hub or 
impact plate. 

The sensor consists of a mat which is wrapped round the steering wheel rim.

The lane keeping assistant with traffic jam assistant is deactivated a few seconds after a hand is 
no longer touching the steering wheel rim. In order to be able to use the steering and lane control 
assistant including traffic jam assistant, the steering wheel must be grasped. When driving with gloves 
on or with a steering wheel cover fitted, the sensor may not be able to detect contact with the steering 
wheel, which means the system may not be able to be used. 

The diagnosis of the Hands-off-Detection is performed in the Body Domain Controller BDC. 

22.1.2. Functional prerequisites 

The following prerequisites must be met in order for the steering and lane control assistant including 
traffic jam assistant to be used: 


140 
















G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

22. Lane & Traffic Jam Assistant 


• Speed must be below 210 km/h. 

• Above 70 km/h: both lane edges must be detected. 

• Below 70 km/h: both lane edges or a vehicle driving ahead must be detected. 

• The lane width must be sufficient. 

• The vehicle should be positioned as centrally as possible in the lane. 

• There must be a sufficient curve radius. 

• At least one hand must be on the steering wheel rim. 

• The turn indicator must not be activated. 

• The camera calibration process must be completed immediately after vehicle delivery. 

The active lateral control function with data evaluation of the KAFAS stereo camera is implemented 
with the assistance of the lane markings identified on the left and right. 

In order for the system to be activated, two lane boundary lines must be detected. Below a speed of 
approximately 70 km/h a vehicle driving ahead in the same lane is sufficient to activate the system. 

The system is put in Standby mode if the marginal conditions are not satisfied (e.g. hands not on 
steering wheel, lane too narrow or dazzling of KAFAS stereo camera). Once all marginal conditions 
have been met, the system is re-enabled automatically. 

To activate the system, the speed of the vehicle is another input quantity that is evaluated. The system 
uses these values to decide which function is enabled. As mentioned above, the threshold values are 
set as follows: 

• The traffic jam assistant can be enabled within a speed range of 0 to 70 km/h. 

• The lane control assistant can be enabled within a speed range of 70 to 210 km/h. 


22.1.3. Lane change 

For a lane change to be as comfortable as possible, the steering and lane control assistant including 
traffic jam assistant is put silently into Standby mode when the turn indicator is activated and 
reactivates itself automatically once the turn indicator is back in its initial position and a lane change 
has occurred. 


22.1.4. Function logic 

The main function logic of the lateral guidance is implemented in the optional equipment system (SAS) 
control unit. 

The majority of the data for the function is provided by the KAFAS stereo camera, where algorithms for 
the lane and object detection run. 

Vehicle dynamics data, such as the driving speed, wheel speeds, yaw rate, steering angle, lateral 
acceleration, longitudinal acceleration, etc., is provided by the rest of the vehicle network via a FlexRay 
or CAN connection. 


A target trajectory (also known as a path curve) is calculated in the optional equipment system (SAS) 
control unit. This is used to determine whether a steering correction is required. 


141 




G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

22. Lane & Traffic Jam Assistant 

22.1.5. Steering interventions 

If the current course of the vehicle deviates too much from the target trajectory (path curve), a steering 
correction is initiated. 

The steering intervention is a corrective measure. This means the driver is not relieved of his duty to 
steer the vehicle. As the corrective steering interventions are limited to approximately 1.5 m/s 2 based 
on the lateral acceleration, the system cannot navigate curves above the respective speed-dependent 
curve radius without the driver's assistance. The driver must therefore steer the vehicle at the same 
time in order to stay on the roadway. 

The target trajectory and required steering corrections are calculated based on the driving speed as 
follows: 

Speed range 0 to 70 km/h: 

• The position and previous movements of the vehicle driving ahead are given priority when 
determining the appropriate steering corrections. 

• Detected lane markings are taken into account to avoid unwanted steering corrections that 
would result in leaving the lane. 

• Corrective steering interventions in the direction of the center of the lane are initiated if the 
vehicle detects there is not a vehicle driving ahead. 

Speed range 70 to 130 km/h: 

• Corrective steering interventions in the direction of the center of the lane are initiated. 

• It is possible to bridge the gap for a limited time where lane markings are not detected by 
estimating the course of the lane based on the vehicle driving ahead. 

Speed range 130 to 210 km/h: 

• Corrective steering interventions in the direction of the center of the lane are initiated. 

• For safety reasons above a driving speed of approximately 130 km/h the course of the lane is 
not estimated using the vehicle driving ahead. 

The vehicle driving ahead is given priority as the "correction target" at speeds ranging between 
approximately 0 and 70 km/h due to the limited detection of lane markings. 

In traffic jams or slow-moving traffic following distances are often extremely small (< 10 m) due to 
tailgating and lanes ahead are often partially covered due to staggered driving. 

This means the KAFAS stereo camera is unable to correctly interpret the lane markings in some cases. 

When classifying the object driving ahead, vehicles such as motorbikes are not used as the "correction 
target". 

Steering torque 

The driving dynamics function software in the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) control unit calculates a 
target steering torque based on the curve nominal value. The target steering torque is then converted 
to an engine torque by the Electronic Power Steering (EPS), which finally results in a steering wheel 
movement at the wheels. 


142 



G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

22. Lane & Traffic Jam Assistant 


The maximum steering torque has been set in such a way that it can always be overruled by the driver 
and therefore steering past the maximum steering torque is possible. 

22.1.6. Operation 

The system is switched on via the traffic jam assistant button on the multifunction steering wheel 
(MFL).

22.1.8. Deactivation criteria 

The steering and lane control assistant including traffic jam assistant is deactivated automatically in 
the following situations: 

• If the vehicle departs from the detected lane or the lane width does not meet the 
requirements. 

• If the lane edges of the current lane are not detected by the KAFAS stereo camera. 

• If no vehicle driving ahead is detected. 

• The vehicle is travelling at a speed greater than 210 km/h. 

• If the Hands-off-Detection cannot detect the hands (at least one hand) on the steering wheel 
rim. Switch-off occurs once a defined time threshold (several seconds) has elapsed. 

• Due to the radius of the bend in the road, the inner lane edge is no longer detected due to the 
camera aperture angle. 

• Pedestrian protection assumes the operating condition "Fault exists". 

• If the turn indicator is on. 

• The driver intervenes actively in the steering. 

• If over a certain time period no lane edges are detected and there is not a vehicle driving 
ahead. 

• If the driver manually deactivates the DSC (DSC off). 

• If there is an intervention from the preventative pedestrian protection. 

• After Dynamic Brake Control braking (brake assistant). 


22.1.9. Limits of the system 

When driving in narrow lanes, e.g. when driving through roadworks or when emergency lanes are 
formed, the system cannot be activated or used meaningfully. 

A_ 

Due to the limited detection capacity of the KAFAS stereo camera, the driver must remain alert and 
observant in order to be able to actively intervene at any time so as to avoid the risk of an accident. The 
system does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility for correctly judging the traffic situation. 
The driver is solely responsible for the vehicle. 


147 





G12 Driver Assistance Systems 

23. Active Lane Keeping Assistant 

The active lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection is part of the Active Driving 
Assistant Plus optional equipment (OE 5AT). 

The system assists the driver in keeping the vehicle in lane and actively avoiding potential side 
collisions by initiating corrective steering interventions within a speed range from 70 km/h to 210 km/ 
h. The system endeavours to orient the vehicle in its lane according to the situation and within the 
framework of the system limits. 

The system consists of the following four sub-functions: 

• Side collision warning 

• Lane departure warning 

• Blind Spot Detection 


23.1. Side collision warning 

The table below shows an overview of the functional characteristics of the "Side collision warning" 
sub-function:

• Sufficient available space on 
the roadway 



23.1.1. Reduced side collision warning 

The reduced side collision warning comes into play if it is not possible to adequately monitor the 
available space on the roadway or there is no available space on the roadway. 

The reduced side collision warning is interlinked with the steering and lane control assistant including 
traffic jam assistant function.
