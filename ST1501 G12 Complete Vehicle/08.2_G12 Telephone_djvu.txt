G12 Telephone and Telematics Systems 

1. Introduction 


In addition to the hands-free telephone system with a base plate with connection to the exterior 
antenna a brand new wireless charging telephone feature is standard equipment. Charging takes 
place wirelessly for the first time using wireless charging technology in the new BMW 7 Series. 

Another new feature of the G12 is transmission of cell phone data by means of Near Field 
Communication or NFC for short. NFC is used for the first time in a BMW, it offers a simplified 
connection setup for Bluetooth pairing of the customer's cell phone. 

Together with the revised Head Unit High 2, a new telematic control unit is being introduced at BMW. 
The Telematic Communication Box 2 TCB2 as a roof-mounted version offers the cell radio 
standard Long Term Evolution LTE in the vehicle for the first time. This new feature permits both 
connection of vehicle such as TeleService and Connected Drive as well as realization of a high-speed 
access to the internet. This Wi-Fi hotspot is available to customers as optional equipment.

2. Special Equipment 

2.1. Standard telephone system 

In the G12, the standard equipment again includes the Bluetooth hands-free system together 
with Bluetooth audio streaming and a USB interface. An AUX-ln interface is no longer offered in the 
G12. An exception to this is the separate connection option in the rear seat entertainment system. 
The hardware for the Bluetooth hands-free system is comprised in the Head Unit High 2. 

In current BMW vehicles and depending on the optional equipment, a base plate and phone cradle 
is provided so that customers can use snap-in adapters in the vehicle. The base plate is located in 
the front center console of the vehicle. It is used for charging the cell phone and has a USB interface 
for the music player connection. Connected via the external vehicle antenna, the field strength for 
the customer's cell phone is significantly improved. Use of the external vehicle antenna is particularly 
advantageous because it greatly enhances the field strength depending on frequency. The standard 
equipment telephone system on the US market G12 includes the 6NW Wireless Charging. This base 
plate and phone cradle is no longer needed as the system uses a wireless charging tray that performs 
all of the same functions. 

A 2nd microphone is installed in the vehicle as standard to enhance the operation of the hands-free 
system, in particular for the front passenger. 

The vehicle equipped with two USB interfaces and there is no longer an AUX-IN port available. 

Both USB interfaces are connected to the head unit and can be accessed in the new main menu 
under "Media/Radio". 

A charge current of up to 2.1 A is available via both USB interfaces to supply the customer's smart 
devices. This is made possible due to the use of an additional USB hub which is installed as standard. 
Both audio and video content can be played back from a USB stick via these interfaces.

The standard telephone function permits simultaneous connection of 2 telephones. A 3rd cell phone 
can be used as an external Bluetooth audio source if required. Up to 4 telephones can be registered in 
advance. 

Numerous additional office functions can be additionally enabled in the main menu Communication/ 
Office in combination with the convenient telephone function. For example, the address book supports 
contact photos if these are maintained and stored on the cell phone. You can find out whether a 
specific cell phone is suitable for this feature at: 

www.bmw.com/bluetooth 

Wi-Fi Hotspot 

A Wi-Fi hotspot is prepared in the vehicle as a highlight of the convenient telephone function. This 
can be activated thanks to special optional equipment which is added to the vehicle together with 
convenient telephone or wireless charging. For further information Wi-Fi Hotspot See Chapter 2. 

User-initiated software update 

A customer-initiated software update (KISU update) for multimedia and telephone is possible 
as standard in the G12. 

Telephone with wireless charging 

Telephone with Wireless Charging (SA 6NW) is offered as standard equipment in the US market 
(See illustration). The scope of hardware and functions is enhanced with a special wireless charging 
tray which is installed in the vehicle instead of the base plate. This smartphone charging tray, called 
"wireless charging tray", is fitted on the side of the center console and permits inductive charging as 
well as inductive coupling with the external vehicle antenna. 

In addition to the customer's smartphone, which remains fully functional with respect to the hands¬ 
free system during charging, it is also possible to perform wireless charging of the BMW Display key 
(SA3DS).

2.2. Wi-Fi Hotspot 

The Wi-Fi Hotspot (SA 6WD) in the vehicle is also already standard for the US market and 
included along with telephone with wireless charging (SA 6NW). The system is offered as 
a free monthly trial. 

It is only necessary to purchase a mobile data plan from your cell phone carrier (i.e. AT&T). Depending 
on local LTE availability and taking into account country-specific restrictions, the customer can then 
surf in the internet with up to 10 devices with a maximum download rate of 100 Mbit/s. 

The purchase of the (pay as you go) plan takes place exclusively via the customer's cell end device 
(PC, smartphone, tablet etc.). The connection is done via the TCB 2 SIM card. When connecting to 
the Wi-Fi hotspot the phone will open a landing page (similar to a hotel Wi-Fi connection) to log in. 
The TCB 2 uses a double connection, one for the BMW ConnectedDrive and telematics functions 
via the BMW server and the other for the Wi-Fi hotspot via AT&T server

4. Telematic Communication Box 2 (TCB2) 

4.1. Comparison with TCB 

The tasks of the Telematic Communication Box (telematic control unit installed since 07/12) were 
clearly defined up to now. The TCB was the modem in the vehicle with integrated SIM card and 
emergency running properties in the event of failure of the vehicle electrical system (emergency 
power supply with own battery). Both TeleServices and the ConnectedDrive services (ASSIST, 
ONLINE, Remote and Internet) use this modem with connected telematic antenna in the roof fin. 

The emergency GSM antenna was a separate component and was hard-wired to the TCB, in addition 
to a microphone and an emergency loudspeaker. 


4.2. New features of the TCB2 

From the F23 on, the TCB2 as a luggage compartment version which uses both antennas for 
reception of the data services (LTE) for the first time with combined operation of the telematic antenna 
and a separate emergency antenna (backup) 

The roof-mounted version of the TCB2 was introduced with the F30 LCI. It is the next evolutionary 
phase of the TCB2 and now also makes its debut in the new BMW 7 Series. Two integrated telematic 
antennas (TEL1 and TEL2) ensure first-class LTE data reception. The integrated emergency GSM 
antenna (backup) now also serves simultaneously as a "hub" for the Wi-Fi hotspot in the vehicle. 

The US version includes the 4G + Wi-Fi hotspot (SA 6WD) feature as standard equipment and it uses 
an AT&T® SIM card as the previous TCB.

The TCB2 is equipped with an emergency battery for power supply if the vehicle electrical system is 
no longer functional. This ensures that the E-CALL system is still supplied with power. The emergency 
battery can be ordered separately from BMW Parts and Accessories. 

A 

If the TCB2 is replaced in the event of a fault, the replacement device will not have an emergency 
battery! The parts technician must order this emergency battery separately. This emergency battery 
must be retrofitted in the TCB2 prior to replacement. 



If an emergency battery develops a fault during the vehicle life cycle, the battery can be replaced. After 
removing the roofliner, the TCB2 can be separated from the antenna unit bonded into position in the 
vehicle roof by means of a release button located on the bottom of the control unit.

5.1. LTE data connection 

5.1.1. Comparison of data transfer rates 


( 40 ) 

(Long Term EvoM>on) •- 

|_|90VD tu 

Comparison of mobile radio data transfer rates 

Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a 4th generation (4G) mobile radio standard. LTE can achieve a 
significantly higher download rate with up to 100 MBit/s. The basic diagram of UMTS is retained for 
LTE. A quick and reasonable changeover of the infrastructures of the UMTS technology (3G standard) 
to LTE Advanced (4G standard) is therefore possible. 

The frequency ranges used differ depending on the region, and vary from about 700 to 2600 MHz. 

The term "Frequency Division Duplex" is understood as transmission and receiving from cell and 
base stations on tow different frequency bands: The mobile device transmits, in the Uplink channel, 
while the base station transmits, in the Downlink channel. Each of the two frequency ranges have a 
bandwidth of 5 MHz. Expressed simply, this means that 2 transmitters and 2 receivers in each case 
transmit and receive simultaneously with 2 different frequencies. 

5.1.2. Multi Input Multiple Output (MIMO) 

With MIMO technology (Multiple Input Multiple Output), it is possible for mobile radio providers to offer 
data speeds with a low error rate. MIMO is the basis for a special encoding procedure which uses both 
temporal and also spatial dimensions for information transfer (Space-Time Coding). 

As a result, the quality (bit error frequency) and data rate of a wireless connection can be improved 
significantly. MIMO systems can transmit considerably more Bit/s per Hz bandwidth used, and are thus 
more efficient than conventional systems. In order to realize the MIMO technology at BMW both data 
antennas present in the vehicle area used simultaneously for the first time for the LTE connection. 
MIMO operates similar to the antenna diversity in the radio system. The signal of both antennas is 
sent, evaluated and combined to minimize errors and optimize data speed.

The G12 is equipped as standard with a manual emergency call in combination with an emergency 
call button and an emergency call antenna. Regular communication in the event of an emergency 
takes place via the SIM card in the TCB2 in combination with the telematic antenna. 

5.2.2. Intelligent emergency call 

The Intelligent emergency call (SA 6AC) is standard in the US market. Its offers and extension of 
the standard emergency call equipment. The telematics service "Intelligent emergency call" sets up 
a connection to emergency and rescue services via a BMW Call Center if necessary in the case of 
manual and automatic emergency calls. In addition to the current position of the vehicle, additional 
data is transmitted about the accident severity, for example.

6.1. Player functions 

6.1.1. History of player functions 

Since an interface (AUX-ln) for music for external audio components (external devices) was offered 
for the first time as standard at BMW in the 3 Series BMW (E90), the number of these interfaces has 
increased significantly over the course of the years. A quantum leap took place in 2007 when the 
introduction of the ULF-SBX-High meant that it was possible for the first time to feed external audio 
into the vehicle via a USB interface and to connect an iPod as a music player. 

The first Bluetooth audio streaming and the first application function on a smartphone (Apps) were 
also realized via a telephone control unit, the Combox multimedia. 

Alongside the familiar cable-connected solutions (wired, one-wire, two-wire, etc.), an increasing 
number of wireless solutions are being used in vehicles. A list of all external interfaces that have 
been implemented in BMW vehicles so far is provided below.

Whereas functions were previously explained with the individual technical devices, a new approach 
is now necessary with the G12. 

Due to the fact that the above list of functions has again been significantly extended for the G12, the 
individual functions would not receive adequate coverage if an explanation were to be provided in 
the same way as before (functions assigned to and subordinate to technical devices). The clarity of the 
explanation would be completely lost. 

For this reason, we will go back to the customer and his needs. We will now consider the desired 
media from the point of view of the customer and will show the various options available to the 
customer so that he can achieve his goal directly. (For example, the customer would like to play 
back music via a smartphone in the snap-in adapter). 

In addition, it must be noted that the interface functionality of the Combox was already ended in 2012 
with integration in the Head Unit High. 

Since the player functions, irrespective of whether external or internal, now take place in or with the 
head unit, you will find a list of all options available to the customer to play audio, pictures video 
or apps in the information bulletin “G12 Audio system".

6.2. Wi-Fi Hotspot 

6.2.1. Wi-Fi hotspot in the vehicle 

The G12 is equipped with numerous Wi-Fi links. All vehicle-related services and functions are 
controlled via the Vehicle Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi Direct). 

^ DIRECT ^ 

fllflff Fi I is 

CERTIFIED S 

Wi-Fi® Direct symbol 

The Wi-Fi Hotspot (SA 6WD) is standard equipment in the US market. This feature provides the 
customer easy access to the internet. The term "Wi-Fi" is commonly used instead of WLAN. That is 
why the term Wi-Fi with the corresponding logo is often used in combination with the WLAN hotspot. 



The hotspot is a multi-point connection similar to a home network. The hotspot performs the task of a 
"hub", as familiar from network technology. The customer can connect up to 10 devices to the hotspot 
(hub) and surf on the internet with a maximum download speed of 100 Mbit/s. A "Client to Client" 
connection is not possible. In other words, the devices cannot communicate with each other. 

In network terms, this means that the "hub" does not have a "bridge" function. 


The hardware in the vehicle for the hotspot is coupled to the optional equipment wireless charging 
(SA 6NW) which includes convenient telephone (SA 6NS). 


The hotspot function can be used by the customer in combination with an existing or additional cell 
data plan. The customer must independently extend the data plan with the provider in the Europe 
and US versions. The procedure is similar to that for booking hotspot access in a hotel or a public 
hotspot in a cafe. After the data connection is set up between the end device (smartphone, tablet PC, 
etc.) and the hotspot, a provider page will be displayed where the customer can independently extend 
the data contract. 


If the booking is successful, a connection will be set up to the free, unfiltered internet via the MIMO- 
LTE data connection in the TCB2. TEL1 and TEL2 in the roof antenna/roof fin are defined as telematic 
antennas for reception, as described in Chapter 5.

The hotspot allows the customer easy access to the internet for his smart devices (smartphones, 
tablets, PC, etc.) and also permits internet access with the Touch Command tablet available for the 
Rear Seat Entertainment. 


For the first time at BMW, the GSM emergency antenna (BACKUP or ECALL antenna) integrated in the 
TCB2 is used as the hotspot antenna for the hotspot in the entire vehicle interior.

The driver's position was intentionally not shown here as a Wi-Fi reception position. When the 
vehicle is stationary, the driver can of course also access the hotspot via a mobile end device (cell 
phone, tablet). 



Alternative internet access options in the G12 

There are therefore 2 options available in the G12 vehicles to access the internet. 

The first possibility is the Wi-Fi hotspot via the a connected cell phone in combination with 
a customer SIM card with active data plan. Further details were previously described above. 

The 2nd possibility for internet access is via the iDrive in the vehicle and coupled to the 
ConnectedDrive "Internet" (SA6AR) which is offered free for one month trial period in the 
US market G12. After the introductory phase (one month free trial), the customer can order the 
"Internet" (SA6AR) service via the ConnectedDrive store (for example). With this function a connection 
to the "filtered internet" is set up via a BMW server (backend) for the system operated via the iDrive 
system. The central information display or rear compartment display is used as a display here. The 
data is transmitted into the vehicle via this server in combination with TCB2 and the permanently 
installed SIM card.

6.3. Wi-Fi-®Direct 


6.3.1. What is Wi-Fi®Direct? 

A new Wi-Fi standard is integrated in the vehicle for control and monitoring functions mainly by the 
rear seat entertainment “Command Tablet” and it is also used for the Screencast feature (see below 
for more information). This “Vehicle Wi-Fi” is a certified standard of the Wi-Fi Alliance which is 
called Wi-Fi®Direct. Please visit the link below for further information. 

http://www.wi-fi.org 

Wi-Fi Direct is a standard for wireless data transmission between two WLAN end devices without 
central Access Point. It is based on the international standard IEEE 802.11 (ISO/IEC 8802-11), which 
describes the properties of a wireless network. 

® 

In the G12, this data transmission always takes place by means of Wi-Fi Direct between the head unit 
(with connected WLAN antenna) and the following end devices: 

• Between the head unit and smartphone for the “Screencast” function 
(see next chapter in this training manual) 

• Between head unit and Touch Command for the control and monitoring 
functions via tablet PC (see the “G12 Rear seat entertainment" 
training manual for more information.

2 additional services. These are Wi-Fi Direct in the vehicle "Vehicle Wi-Fi" and the Wi-Fi hotspot in 
the vehicle "Internet hotspot". 

Two examples are provided below of how the customer can activate the functions Wi-Fi Direct 
(Vehicle Wi-Fi) and the Wi-Fi hotspot (Internet hotspot) and then connect a device with them.

6.5. Screencast 


6.5.1. Screencast (mirroring function) 

Screencast is an open standard for connecting two computers with each other by means of a 
wireless connection. In the case of the G12, this function shares or “mirrors” the screen content 
of a smartphone or tablet with the head unit. The content is displayed in the vehicle on the central 

information display. Wi-Fi Direct is used as the data transmission standard in the G12 Wi-Fi Direct. 

If a rear seat entertainment system is installed, the content can also be projected onto the two rear 
compartment displays via the head unit and RSE control unit if the customer wishes. 

Speedlock 

Image files, music files and films can be played back as content with the Screencast function. 
However, the content on the CID is suppressed at a vehicle speed of more than 7 km/h (5 mph). 

The content remains visible on the rear compartment displays at speeds above 7 km/h (5mph). 

A_ 

Since the head unit cannot detect what screen content is streamed to the vehicle via Screencast, 
the above-described speedlock is always activated at a speed of 7 km/h. This applies irrespective of 
whether a film with moving pictures, a music track or photos or screen content are displayed. Music 
and audio playback are not affected by the Screencast speedlock.

6.6. Wireless charging 

6.6.1. Definition of wireless charging 

Telephone with wireless charging (SA 6NW) is an innovation for BMW vehicles. In the new BMW 
7 Series, charging of telephones takes place wirelessly for the first time using wireless charging 

technology. There is the so-called “Qi ” symbol for wireless charging products. The Chinese word 
for life energy is a copyrighted standard of the Wireless Power Consortium. 

http://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/ 

This standard is intended to ensure that individual chargers are compatible for all devices. 



35 



G12 Telephone and Telematics Systems 

6. Connectivity 

6.6.2. Wireless charging in the G12 

Wireless charging (WCA) in the G12 is visible for the customer in the form of a special wireless 
charging tray. The Telephone with wireless charging (SA 6NW) is standard equipment for the US 
market. Instead of a base plate, the vehicle is then equipped with a wireless charging tray. 

In the case of telephone with wireless charging, both Qi -capable cell phones or optionally the BMW 
Display key (SA 3DS) are charged in the G12. 

A large number of cell phones are already equipped with the WCA function (Qi ready) and can be 
charged in the wireless charging tray. In addition, the function can be retrofitted to the cell phone by 
fitting a WCA-capable rear cover or adding a WCA-capable case. 

A 

Never place a cell phone and the BMW Display key in the wireless charging tray together. 

Only one of the two devices would be charged. 


Bluetooth audio streaming, Bluetooth Apps streaming, Screencast (Desktop Sharing) and associate 
image or video streaming via Android smart devices can be used in the vehicle during charging of the 
cell phone in the wireless charging tray. Details of the individual streaming services can be found in the 
“G12 Audio systems” training manual.

6.6.9. Status LED and possible incorrect operation 

An LED is provided on the wireless charging tray in order to inform the customer about the respective 
status of the charging connection. 

The LED starts to light up blue as soon as a metal object is inserted in the wireless charging tray. 

During this time, the electronics in the wireless charging tray checks whether the metal object is WCA- 

or Qi -compatible and can be charged. If this is the case, i.e. if "brokering" was successful, the LED 
remains illuminated "blue" after 10 s. If this should not be the case, the LED will go off again after 10 s. 

A_ 

If there is a compatible device and another object in the wireless charging tray (e.g. a coin), 
both objects will be detected by the system and the charging procedure will not be started.

* Charging-Only mode: 

If the external device is actively connected via Bluetooth Apps, there is no longer a seamless 
transition from Bluetooth Audio or Apps (wireless) to USB audio (cable-connected). This was 
the case with HU-H. The stream was stopped and switch over to cable took place. 

In the G12, if Apps or audio playback is wished via cable or the USB port when a wireless source 
is already active, the Bluetooth function must first be deactivated. Otherwise the stream will 
continue wirelessly after connection for the charging function in spite of the cable connection.
