1.5.3. Light carpet 

The light source is integrated into the side sill, where it is invisible to the customer. This feature can 
be in a very small installation space through the use of a multi-lens design system. A very flat angle of 
radiation is also possible. The graphic is superimposed several times by the multi-lens design system 
and is therefore insensitive to dirt contamination. The light carpet is activated by the Body Domain 
Controller (BDC).

RGB (red, yellow, blue) LED modules are used for ambient lighting in the G12. 

The ambient interior lighting is controlled via a separate local interconnect network bus. All the 
individual LED modules are connected in series via LIN-bus. 

If the local interconnect network bus is interrupted at one location or the microcontroller at the LED is 
defective, the other light source is interrupted at this location. A search for the fault must be carried out 
at the location where the last LED illuminates.

LED modules are used for the speaker cover lighting. 

White LEDs are used for the light saber lighting. 

The lighting of the panorama glass roof is accomplished using LEDs. 


The lighting is controlled via 2 local LIN-buses: 

• LIN-bus from Light Effect Manager to the panorama glass roof and Touch Command 

• LIN-bus from Light Effect Manager to the light sabers and to the LED modules of the 
speaker covers

Light Effect Manager 



Light Effect Manager 

The control unit Light Effect Manager (LEM) is responsible for controlling the following lighting: 

• Panorama glass roof 

• Light sabers at the B-pillars of the G12 

• Speaker covers in the High End audio system 

• Touch Command snap-in adaptor 


Panorama glass roof 

The ambient lighting of the interior is extended to the panorama glass roof. This creates a high-quality 
roof appearance for journeys at night. 

The light colors are coupled with the colors of the ambient lighting of the vehicle interior. The lighting 
of the panorama glass roof can be dimmed separately. 

Function 

The light is fed into the window glass by means of LED modules and fiber optic conductors installed at 
the sides. The light is refracted at the printed graphic and diverted into the interior.

The wiper motor is a 12 V motor with a transmission. The control unit, the wiper motor and the 
transmission form one replaceable unit. This wiper motor unit comprises: 

• A permanent magnet, direct current motor with attached reduction gear 

• Control unit electronics with eccentric shaft sensor and suppressor components with 
attached plug connection 

The control unit in the wiper motor is able to identify the following faults: 

• Faults in the control unit electronics 

• Short circuits at the motor and sensor system 

• Open lines at the motor and sensor system 

The control unit in the wiper motor does not have a fault memory. The fault code entry is stored in the 
Body Domain Controller (BDC). 

The heated washer jets are activated by the Body Domain Controller. 

The Body Domain Controller is also responsible for activation of the windscreen washer pump and 
evaluation of the washer fluid level switch.

4.2.2. Function 

The function of the central locking system of the G12 is based on that of current BMW models. 

All functions relevant for the central locking system are controlled by the Body Domain Controller. 
The function is as follows: 

• The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the remote control receiver. 

• The signal causes the BDC to activate the central locking system and the interior lighting. 

• The BDC evaluates the status of all door contacts, the tailgate and valet position switch. 

• The status of the central locking system button is also evaluated by the BDC. 

The BDC activates the central locking system, depending on the status. 

• The BDC is responsible for activation of the central locking system and the drive for 
automatic soft-close in the tailgate. 

• Activation of fuel filler flap unlocking is also performed by the BDC.

The alarm system in the G12 is equipped with an ultrasonic interior movement detector for monitoring 
the passenger compartment. The ultrasonic interior movement detector (USIS) is fully integrated in 
the roof function center (FZD). 

The door contacts, engine compartment lid contact switch and the opening of the tailgate are 
monitored by the Body Domain Controller. As soon as a status changes, the ultrasonic interior 
movement detector receives this information via the K-CAN2. If the alarm system is activated, 
the siren with tilt alarm sensor is activated by the control unit in the event of a break-in. 

The SINE is connected to the FZD via a local interconnect network bus. 

The status of the alarm system is displayed via the LED at the interior mirror.

The instrument cluster receives the value of the ambient temperature from the outside temperature 
sensor and makes this available via the PT-CAN. The Body Domain Controller evaluates the signal 
and triggers the activation of the mirror heating via the local interconnect network bus. The control 
of the heater output is dependent on the ambient temperature and the switch position of the driving 
experience switch. 

The mirror servomotors are activated by the mirror electronics. The request for adjusting the exterior 
mirror is received by the mirror electronics via the local interconnect network bus.

adjustment, a maximized backrest angle, a folding head restraint as well as an integrated footrest in the 
front passenger seat. The all-round visibility and leg room achieved provides enhanced travel quality 
for the passenger in the right rear seat (optional equipment — Rear Executive Lounge Seating (SA 
ZRE)). No lumbar adjustment, massage function or backrest width adjustment are possible for the 
captain's chair. 

The front passenger seat can also be adjusted by means of the seat adjustment controls in the rear 
passenger compartment.

13.4. Massage 

8 different massage functions in the backrest and seat cushion are available to activate or relax 
muscles. This allows the back muscles to be relaxed and the strain on the spinal discs to be relieved. 
The 8 programs are divided into 3 categories: 

• Mobilization 

• Relaxation 

• Vitalization 

In the case of mobilization, the strain on the spine is relieved by targeted body movements. 

In the relaxation program, the muscles are relaxed by massage. 

The vitalization program is made up of both mobilization and relaxation. The combination of movement 
and massage ensures relaxation and recuperation, particularly on long journeys.

13.6. BMW Vitality Program 

For the first time at BMW, there is active interaction of the rear seat passenger with the rear seat. 

This function allows the customer to relax in a sitting position on long journeys and to regenerate 
the spinal discs by active movements. The training can be started via Touch Command or with the 
remote control of the Rear Seat Entertainment. A calibration run is performed for individual adaptation 
to the occupants. An animation on the rear compartment display shows which movement should 
be performed. Sensors in the backrest measure the applied pressure, which is displayed on the rear 
compartment display. The customer is thus given feedback and can respond to this. The training 
success is displayed at the end of each exercise. 

The following optional equipment is required for the BMW Vitality Program: 

• Massage, rear passenger compartment (SA 4T6) 

• Rear Seat Entertainment (SA 6FR)

The SZL sends the information via the local interconnect network bus 
to the Body Domain Controller. 

The Body Domain Controller evaluates the information and activates 
the relay for the horn.
