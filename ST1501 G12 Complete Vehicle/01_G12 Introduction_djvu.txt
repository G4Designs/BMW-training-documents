G12 Introduction 

1. Introduction 


The 6th generation of the BMW 7 Series code named G12 is now being launched on the market. 

The new BMW 7 Series is also a technology pioneer. In other words, it features a host of new 
technologies and further developed design elements. 

The closed radiator grille and the precise contours of the hood lend the front of the new BMW 7 Series 
a sporty character at first glance. The elegant lines of the side view are emphasized by the distinctive 
double crease and the highlighted Hofmeister kink. The chrome trim strips at the rear and the L shape 
of the rear lights round off the striking and confident appearance of the new BMW 7 Series. 

The luxurious interior of the new BMW 7 Series is characterized by the quality craftsmanship at a 
supreme level, precise surfaces and a completely new feeling of spaciousness. This is complemented 
by technical highlights such as Ambient light and BMW Touch Command. But it is the seating comfort 
in particular that sets new standards in this vehicle class. 

A particular technical highlight of the body is the body structure with carbon reinforcements. This is 
based on technology transfer from development of the BMW i vehicles. Use of carbon with its specific 
material properties increases torsional rigidity and strength. The weight is reduced at the same time. 


1.1. History 

E23 



E23 

The E23 is the first BMW 7 Series and was produced from 1977 to 1986. 

The passenger cell has a dynamic appearance due to the pronounced slope of the A-pillar and smooth 
roofline transition to the rear. This lends the E23 a sporty yet elegant look. 

In the interior, the instrument panel is turned towards the driver, making the operating elements easier 
to reach. This ergonomically optimum driver orientation has become a design feature that is typical for 
BMW. 

The E23 was initially produced in the works in Munich and Dingolfing. As from December 1982, 
the E23 rolled off the assembly line only in Dingolfing, like all subsequent BMW 7 series models.

G12 Introduction 

1. Introduction 

E32 



E32 


The E32 was produced from 1986 to 1994. 

The harmonious contours and flowing transitions at the front, side and rear provide the E32 with a 
particularly elegant look. The horizontally wider radiator grill reinforces the presence of the front end. 
The L-shaped rear lights form the basis of an important BMW design element. 

The E32 was also the first BMW 7 Series to be offered as a long version - with a 11.4 cm / 4.5 inch 
longer body. 

E38 



E38 


The E38 was produced from 1994 to 2001. 

Thanks to its elegant lines, the 3rd generation of the BMW 7 Series has a more elegant and elongated 
appearance than its predecessor. 

Particular attention is paid to the rear seat passengers through a host of equipment and design details. 

In addition to the "normal" long version (wheelbase extended by 14 cm / 5.5 inches), the E38 was also 
produced in a version with a 39 cm /15.3 inch-longer wheelbase as the “L7”.

1. Introduction 

E65/E66 



E65 


The E65 was produced from 2001 to 2008 (LCI: 2005 to 2008). 

BMW opened up a completely new design era with the E65. The front end preserves the typical BMW 
radiator grille and twin circular headlights. The front headlights extend elegantly into the side contours. 
The side contour exudes calm and elegance thanks to the single continuous line extending from the 
front through to the complete rear end. The roofline has a Coupe-like form. 

The greatest revolution in the vehicle interior is the iDrive operating system. This system made it 
possible to dispense with a large number of buttons, making the driving area appear much tidier 
and clearer. 

The E66 is the long version of the E65 and was therefore given its own development code 
for the first time. 

F01/F02 



F01 


The F01/F02 was produced from 2008 to 2015 (LCI: from 2012). 

The 5th generation of the BMW 7 Series creates an even stronger presence through its large air inlets 
and long hood. At the sides, the balanced proportions are elegantly extended by longitudinal lines and 
surfaces. The width of the rear area is emphasized to convey the vehicle's sporting character.

The basic version of the G12 already features a large number of chrome strips. The ornamental 
grille and the air flaps are finished in high-gloss Black and have chrome trims on the front surfaces. 

A chrome strip is fitted in each case above and below the bottom air inlets on the right and left. 

Like on the F01/F02, the G12 also features tailpipes integrated in the body. These have a model- 
dependent design and are surrounded by a chrome frame. There is a further chrome strip in each case 
next to the reflectors in the rear bumper. The continuous chrome strip on the trunk is continued in the 
rear lights.

The bodyshell of the G12 was designed completely as a lightweight construction. The focus here is 
on the body structure as a so-called carbon core. In addition to the components made of steel and 
aluminium, this also features numerous reinforcements made of carbon. The different materials are 
used so that their specific characteristics optimally complement each other. As a result, it is above all 
the material mix that ensures a low weight in combination with high crash safety. 

Thanks to the intelligent material mix, it was possible to reduce the weight of the body structure by 
approximately 40 kg / 88 lbs compared with the F02.

The body structure of the G12 is made of steel, aluminium and carbon components. Through the 
consistent use of high-strength and ultra-high-strength steels and high-strength aluminium alloys, 
it was possible to increase the overall minimum proof stress of all metal materials in the bodyshell 
compared with the predecessor. An additional weight reduction was achieved by the use of carbon 


12 




















G12 Introduction 

2. Bodyshell 


The side frame of the G12 comprises a three-piece frame: 

• Outer side frame 

The outer side frame is made of deep-drawing steel. 

• Middle side frame 

The middle side frame is made of a material mix comprising ultra-high-strength 
heat-formed steel and carbon. This combination means that the middle side 
frame is optimized both in terms of weight and rigidity. 

• Inner side frame 

The inner side frame is made of high-strength and ultra-high-strength steel grades.

The body structure consists largely of high-strength and ultra-high-strength steel grades. The share 
of ultra-high-strength heat-formed steel grades is particularly high. 

An example of this is the B-pillar reinforcement plate. This is made from a tailored rolled blank. 

This made it possible to achieve an additional reduction in weight. 

Further information on the steel grades used for body construction can be found in the information 
bulletin “Fundamentals of Steel”.

The use of aluminium extruded profiles and complex die-cast aluminium parts permits realization of 
high body rigidity in combination with low weight. All requirements relating to passive safety are also 
met. 

The spring strut domes at the front and, also for the first time, at the rear are manufactured using 
the aluminium pressure die casting process. New aluminium cast alloys were developed in order to 
increase the crash safety of these components. These alloys are characterized above all by improved 
crash performance.

Some of the aluminium-steel connections in the G12 body structure are produced using the new body 
joining technique of flow drill screws. These include, for example the connection between the engine 
support (aluminium extruded profile) and the bulkhead carrier support (ultra-high-strength hot-formed 
steel).

G12 Introduction 

2. Bodyshell 


Flow drill screws are driven directly into the superposed sheets. When this happens, the specially 
shaped tip produces a flow hole and a thread is then cut. This joining technique is used exclusively 
in production. 

A_ 

When a flow drill screw connection has been undone, it must not be joined again by means 
of flow drill screws. This could lead to a considerable reduction in strength. 

In the event of a repair according to body repair level 2 and 3, the flow drill screws are replaced 
by blind rivets.

stud joining method which is used in production to fix the storage shelf in position. Lego-Fit (Ball 
socket) connections consist of a steel ball integrated in the body on the one side and a plastic clip 
on the opposite side.

G12 Introduction 
3. Body Repair Level 1 


Taking into account the repair stages of the workshop information system of BMW, the body repair 
work in the technical training is divided into three repair levels. Each of the three Body Repair Levels 
includes certain prerequisites for the training of the employees and for the workshop equipment. 

The special characteristics of the add-on body parts and the materials used in the outer body skin are 
described in this chapter. However, the basic functions of the roof and the outer body skin components 
made of plastic are the same as on other current BMW models. For this reason, these components will 
not be described in detail here.

The bumper panels at front and rear as well as the side sills are made of plastic (PP + EPDM) as before. 
However, further development of this material made it possible to reduce the density and weight.

The front and rear doors essentially have the same structure. The descriptions in this chapter refer to 
the driver's door. 

Like on the predecessor, the doors of the G12 have an aluminium shell design. The aluminium 
supporting structure is connected with the aluminium outer skin by innovative laser welding 
technology. 

The stepless door stop holds the door in any position. The moment of friction required for this is 
produced by 2 set screws which are tensioned at the sides against the retaining strap. The set screws 
are adjusted in production and cannot then be adjusted again. In addition, 2 spring-loaded sliding 
elements hold the door in defined detent positions when the vehicle is inclined. These positions are 
determined by the geometry of the retaining strap. The compact design of the door stop makes it 
possible to achieve a weight saving for all door stops of approx. 2.5 kg / 5.5 lbs compared with the door 
stops on F01/F02. 

The door lock optionally features automatic soft-close. Emergency operation is possible via the 
integrated lock cylinder. 

The side impact protection is made of high-strength steel.

The lightweight supports of the front and rear doors have essentially the same design. 

The descriptions in this chapter refer to the lightweight support for the driver's door. 

The lightweight support is mounted on the door structure by means of screws and bayonet fittings. 

It divides the interior of the door into a dry side and a wet side. The dry side is closed off to the inside 
by the door trim panel and the wet side is closed towards the outside by the door outer skin. Sensitive 
components - such as speakers, airbag sensors and electric drives - are located on the dry side and 
are protected against moisture. 

The power window mechanism is based on a cable mechanism. The electrical drive force is provided 
by an electric motor installed on the dry side of the lightweight support. 

A 

The door airbag sensors must not be cleaned with compressed air otherwise they will be destroyed. 

The seals of the lightweight supports must not be damaged in order to guarantee proper functioning 
of the airbag sensors in the doors.

it serves as a support for components such as the headlights, auxiliary radiators and hood catches. 

The front end also performs important tasks for crash safety: 

• Complete absorption of the impact energy for accidents at slow speeds 
up to approx. 16 km/h /10 mph. 

• Avoidance of excessive loads on knee and hip joints in the event of an 
accident with pedestrians. 

• Load distribution between the right and left vehicle halves in the event 
of a one-sided head-on collision.

G12 Introduction 
3. Body Repair Level 1 


In the G12, it has been possible to successfully meet the increased requirements for crash safety in 
spite of a weight reduction of the front end compared with the F01/F02. This was achieved mainly 
through the use of high-strength aluminium. A further reason is the one-piece design of the bumper 
support and deformation elements. The use of welded connections instead of screw connections 
saves weight and at the same time increases rigidity.

US version vehicles must pass an additional crash test, the small overlap test, for the purpose of 
optimum insurance classification. 

The small overlap in the "Small overlap test" means that there is, in principle, a risk that the front wheel 
will damage the bulkhead. This is avoided in the G12 in US version by additional components in the 
front end. 

In the event of a corresponding head-on collision, the crash frame is pressed against the front wheel. 
As a result, the rim is guided so that the wheel is prevented from turning in. The tensioning straps 
stabilize the position of the respective crash frame.

*IIHS: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 

In the "Small Overlap" test, the vehicle is driven against a rigid barrier at a speed of 64 km/h / 40 mph. 
The overlap is only 25 % so that the impact energy cannot be transferred into the body structure 
directly via the engine support. Instead, the load path is via the front wheel to the side sill and via the 
bulkhead carrier support to the side frame.

The trunk of the G12 is made completely of aluminium for the first time. This made it possible to 
realize a weight saving of approx. 5.5 kg /12 lbs compared with the trunk of the F02. The outer skin 
components area connected with each other by means of laser weld seams. 

The G12 is equipped as standard with automatic trunk operation. The trunk is opened and closed by 
means of a spindle drive. Whereas other current BMW vehicles are equipped with one spindle drive 
each on the right and left sides, the G12 has a single spindle drive on the right side. 

The following actuation options are available for the trunk, depending on the vehicle equipment:

The standard equipment for the G12 is the a panorama glass roof. Compared with the conventional 
glass slide/tilt sunroof, the panorama glass roof offers an improved feeling of spaciousness for the 
rear seat passengers. 

The front glass slide/tilt sunroof panel can be moved externally over the rear glass panel. The rear 
glass slide/tilt sunroof panel is fixed and contributes to the rigidity of the body as a thrust surface. 

The panorama glass roof is installed from inside. This makes it possible to omit trim elements in the 
edge area of the roof and a harmonious overall appearance is produced. The rear glass panel as an 
aperture to permit optimum positioning of the roof-mounted aerial. 

3.7.2. Panorama roof roller blinds 

As sun protection and noise insulation, the panorama glass roof has 2 panorama roof roller blinds, 
one each for the front and rear roofliner cutouts. These are available in different materials and colors. 

Operation is performed via the roof function center, the buttons in the rear doors or BMW Touch 
Command. 

The panorama roof roller blinds can be opened and closed seamlessly and independently of each 
other. An anti-trap mechanism is active during automatic closing.

3.7.4. Functions 

The panorama glass roof and panorama roof roller blinds have the following additional functions: 

• Rain closing 

If the G12 is parked with open panorama glass roof and the rain-light-solar-condensation 
sensor detects rain, the front glass slide/tilt sunroof panel closes to the vent position. 

• Parking functions 

If the G12 is parked with open panorama glass roof, the panorama glass roof will automatically 
move to vent position after 6 hours. 

When the vehicle is locked, the rear panorama roof roller blind is closed in order to prevent 
possible heating up of the rear seats and the BMW Touch Command due to solar radiation. 
When the vehicle is unlocked, the rear panorama roof roller blind is automatically moved to 
the position it was in before locking. 

• Convenient closing/convenient opening 

The front glass slide/tilt sunroof panel and the panorama roof roller blind can be opened and 
closed via the ID transmitter. 

• Crash risk closing 

In case of an accident, the front glass slide/tilt sunroof panel and the front panorama roof roller 
blind are automatically closed. 


3.7.5. Notes for Service 

Initialization 

Initialization is frequently necessary after working on the panorama glass roof or panorama roof roller 
blinds. This can be recognized by the fact that automatic opening or closing of the panorama glass 
roof is not possible. 

A function check must be performed after initialization. 

A_ 

No anti-trap function is available during initialization. 

The procedure described in the ISTA workshop information system must always be observed.

G12 Introduction 
3. Body Repair Level 1 


Installation and adjusting procedures 

The components of the panorama glass roof can normally be replaced individually. It is necessary 
to pay attention to a number of special points to note for exchange as well as installation and 
disassembly. 

• Removal 

Removal of the panorama glass roof in the workshop should be performed by at least 2 
employees. Since the rear glass slide/tilt sunroof panel is secured and adjusted individually, 
it should also be transported individually. The panorama glass roof frame must not be lifted at 
the two front and rear ends. Otherwise, this may result in a kink in the middle part of the frame. 

• Assembly 

The entire installation procedure for the panorama glass roof is performed from the vehicle 
interior. The rear glass slide/tilt sunroof panel is installed first and then the panorama glass 
frame together with front glass slide/tilt sunroof panel. The front glass slide/tilt sunroof panel 
must be moved to vent position before installation. A specific sequence must be observed 
when tightening the mounting bolts of the rear glass slide/tilt sunroof panel and the panorama 
glass roof frame. Leaks can occur if this sequence is not observed. Disassembly takes place in 
reverse order. 

• Setting 

The rear glass slide/tilt sunroof panel is supplied pre-adjusted. Nevertheless, fine adjustment 
is necessary in some cases. This is performed in Z-direction by means of 5 adjusting screws. 
After installation of the panorama glass roof frame, the front glass slide/tilt sunroof panel 
is adjusted by means of its 6 mounting bolts. The trim covers inserted at the side must be 
removed for adjustment with installed roofliner.

Top air flaps completely closed 


A new generation of automatic air flap control is used in the G12. The air flaps are located at the top 
within the ornamental grille surround (radiator grilles) and behind the air inlets of the bumper panel. 

The top air flaps are integrated in the front ornamental grille for the first time and are thus located in 
the direct field of view. 

The top and bottom air flaps are controlled via separate actuators. When a corresponding cooling 
request is received, the bottom air flaps always open first and then the top air flaps. The bottom air 
flaps can also move to several intermediate positions. The air flaps are activated briefly when the 
ignition is switched on. 

3.8.2. Underbody panelling 

In comparison with the F01/F02, larger areas of the vehicle underbody area closed in the G12. 

This applies above all to the rear area. This results in reduced drag and also lower carbon dioxide 
emissions. 

The use of textile material also improves the external acoustics.

The instrument panel already features a 12.3" Central Information Display (CID) as standard 
equipment. This display is a touch display. Some climate control functions can also be operated via 
touch-sensitive surfaces, depending on equipment. 

The instrument cluster has an 12.3" display in the standard equipment. This allows the displays to be 
adapted to the respective driving situation. Some of the displays can be customized. 

Some functions can be controlled contactlessly via the BMW gesture control. For example, the volume 
of the radio can be adjusted by a certain hand movement. In order to permit this function, a camera is 
installed in the roof function center. 

There is a wireless charging tray in the center console for charging the optional BMW Display key 
(3DS). Certain smartphones (Samsung) can also be charged in the wireless charging tray. There must 
always only ever be one device for charging in the wireless charging tray. 

In combination with the optional “Ambient Air package” (4NM), the vehicle interior can be scented 
with a fragrance at regular intervals. The compartment for the fragrance cartridges is located in the 
glove box. 

The glove box contains a switch which can be used to separately lock the trunk. When the glove box 
is locked, the trunk can then no longer be opened without the mechanical ignition key. This is useful if 
the vehicle is parked by a parking service.

The roller sunblinds for the rear side windows/side window glass (416) are offered in combination with 
the optional equipment rear window roller sunblind (415). 

There are 2 individual roller sunblinds in each case in the rear doors for the moving side window and 
fixed side window glass. The roller sunblinds are driven by a common electric motor. This means that 
the two roller sunblinds can only be opened or closed at the same time. 

The blinds are operated via buttons in the door trim panels or by the BMW Touch Command.

The luggage compartment dimensions of the G12 have increased slightly in comparison with the F01 / 
F02. As a result, the luggage compartment capacity has grown from 500 I to 515 I. However, some 
equipment specifications result in a reduction in the luggage compartment capacity.
