1. Introduction 


Introduction to Headunit High 2 

The 4th generation head unit with Navigation Professional Headunit High 2 has gradually replaced 
the Headunit High since the end of 2014. The first vehicle with the new head unit was the new 2 
Series convertible (F23). This was followed by the BMW 1 Series and 2 Series vehicles in March 2015 
and the BMW 3 Series and 4 Series vehicles in July. The Headunit High 2 with completely revamped 
hardware will now also be offered in the new BMW 7 Series (G12) . The user interface (ID5++) for the 
new BMW 7 Series (G12) has also been completely redesigned. 

Vehicle electrical system connection 

With the Headunit High 2, a new bus system has been introduced. The "OPEN Alliance BroadR- 
Reach" (OABR Ethernet) is used for the data transmission between the head unit and telematic 
control unit. The topic of OABR Ethernet is dealt with in detail in the "G12 Telephone and telematic 
systems" training manual. 

Navigation 

In addition to the familiar update options for the map data, an automatic update is now also offered 
in combination with the Headunit High 2 with the introduction of the G12. Customers can benefit 
from automatic map updates in combination with a 3-year navigation map subscription. The head unit 
contains a new user interface and many new navigation features. These are described in the "G12 
Navigation system" training manual. In addition, a number of sensors for the navigation system have 
been relocated to the surrounding vehicle electrical system environment. 

Rear seat entertainment (RSE) 

The rear seat entertainment system has also been updated in combination with the Headunit High 2. 
Alongside a new RSE control unit and a tablet PC to control the functions (called Touch Command), 
a host of new functions are now available in the vehicle. 

Telematic systems and ConnectedDrive 

A new telematic control unit is being introduced at BMW with the Headunit High 2. For the first time, 
the Telematic Communication Box 2 TCB2 offers the mobile radio standard Long Term Evolution (LTE) 
in the vehicle. LTE is used for the ConnectedDrive services (e.g. BMW Online, Internet), the telematic 
services (TeleService, Remote Services) and for the emergency call system Intelligent Emergency 
Call. This is complemented by a permanently installed Wi-Fi hotspot (SA 6WD) for the first time in the 
automotive industry. This hotspot also supports the LTE standard. You can find further information 
regarding the Wi-Fi hotspot in the "G12 Telephone systems" training manual. 

Telephone, connectivity, player connection 

A new feature in the G12 is that telephone with wireless charging is offered as standard equipment in 
the US market, the feature is BMW Telephony with wireless charging (SA 6WA), wireless charging 
of mobile phones. Further details on this are provided in the "G12 Telephone and telematic systems" 
training manual. 

2 new versions of the snap-in adapter for the base plate for convenient telephone are offered for 
the new iPhone 6. The generic snap-in adapter (Snap-in-Adapter Connect Universal) can be used 

r^) rp) 

for all iPhone versions (iPhone 5, 5C, 5S, 6 and 6 Plus) with Lightning connector (available since 
February 2015). In addition, a special iPhone 6 snap-in adapter is offered exclusively for the iPhone

6 (available since April/May 2015). The snap-in adapter Universal 2.0 was introduced for Android 
telephones in spring 2015. This supports all common Android telephones in the areas of hands-free 
mode, charging, smartphone music player connection and Android apps. 

In addition, there are 2 USB interfaces in the G12 (second USB interface in combination with 
the standard equipment (in the US) Telephone with Wireless charging) which additionally permit 
connection of smartphones as music players via one-wire technology with all original (OEM) and 
BMW Accessories cables. 

Bluetooth audio streaming is already present as standard equipment. 

As additional streaming variants, the G12 also offer Screencast (via Wi-Fi Direct) and Apps over 
the Air (via Bluetooth). 

Speaker systems 

2 hi-fi systems are offered in the G12. Each of the 2 systems has a hi-fi amplifier which is specifically 
adapted for each system. The Top HiFi system is the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System (SA 
688) is offered as the standard system. 

And for the first time at BMW, a High End system is offered in cooperation with Bowers & Wilkins. 

The system can be ordered by the customer as optional equipment (SA 6F1).

2.4.4. New Ethernet 

History 

Ethernet with 5-lines or 4-lines. 

Since the F01, Ethernet has been used at BMW for vehicle programming and for updating the map 
data of the navigation systems with 5 lines (4 x data lines and 1 x activation line of the OBD interface 
including shielding). 

Another Ethernet connection is installed in FOx or FI x vehicles: a 5-wire Ethernet system from the 
BDC to the head unit or from the head unit to the Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE). Four data lines are 
used here for transmission of the navigation data for the RSE. An activation line is not required. 

Both Ethernet variants are comparable with the standard Ethernet variant 10OBASE-TX in PC 
networks. The Ethernet version with 5 lines is still used in the G12 from the OBD2 interface to 
the Body Domain Controller. 

New 

Ethernet with 2 lines 

In the G12, the Headunit High is connected with the Telematic Communication Box 2 TCB2 by means 
of a new Ethernet version for the first time in the BMW 7 Series. Unshielded Twisted Single Pair is 
an Ethernet variant which was developed by the OPEN Alliance BroadR-Reach. These are two-wire, 
twisted and unshielded lines for data transfer. At BMW, this Ethernet is called "OABR Ethernet", 
which has been especially adapted for the automotive sector. 

The data rate for an OABR Ethernet connection is up to maximum of 2 x 100 Mbit/s. 

A comparison of the previous connection between BDC and head unit (5-wire Ethernet) and the new 
variant (2-wire Ethernet) can be found below.

Hardware advantages 

One of the first options is the transmission of vehicle camera data (FI 5). The advantage of Ethernet 
is that vehicle cameras (IP-based) are not only connected to one control unit, but several control units 
can access the data flows of the vehicle cameras. The network is therefore very flexible and is well 
prepared for the future. 

Another important advantage is the fast programming of control units. The programming times are 
reduced significantly via Ethernet. Whereas a CAN bus can only transmit data with a maximum length 
of 8 bytes per message, Ethernet messages have a length of over 1500 bytes. The user data rate thus 
increases: Considerably more message packages can be transmitted in a shorter period. 

Other applications such as the control unit communication, the networking of vehicles with the 
environment and diagnosis usages, will also increase the importance of Ethernet. Furthermore, with 
a OABR Ethernet connection only two lines (instead of the previous five lines with Ethernet) are used, 
meaning additional weight and costs can be saved. Details on data transfer, the physical layer and layer 
model are explained in the "G12 Bus systems" training manual.

4.1.1. Introduction 

The functions of the new Headunit High 2 correspond to those of the Headunit High with the hardware 
introduction. However, the improved hardware components (CPU, RAM, graphics card) 
allow for considerably smoother image structures. 

A_ 

A full description of the individual functions of the Headunit High 2 can be found in the Owner's 
Manuals of the respective vehicles. 


4.1.2. iDrive operating concept ID5++ 

The iDrive operating concept comprises the following 3 components in the basic equipment: the 
Central Information Display (CID), the controller CON and the Headunit High 2. The user interface 
is controlled in the Headunit High 2. The operating concept was completely revamped for the 
introduction of the G12. It was optimized in order to also permit touch and gesture control in 
addition to control by the iDrive system and operation at the center stack (audio control panel). 
Touch screen control at the CID is part of the standard equipment; gesture control is linked to 
selection of optional equipment. 

Further detailed information on the topic of touch and gesture control and the associated optional 
equipment is provided in the "Displays and Controls" training manual.

The main menu "Media/Radio": All media sources of the predecessor head units, i.e. all content of 
the "old" main menus CD/Multimedia and Radio, was combined here in a large list. The new main 
menu Media/Radio was created from the menus CD/Multimedia and Radio. For the customer, this 
offers a large number of different options for playing audio files, images, video/film files and apps in the 
vehicle. In order to maintain clarity, the customer can make the media selection individually in a new 
submenu and thus create his own individual list. 

The submenu is called: Personalize menu. This submenu "Personalize menu" is not just provided 
under Media/Radio but also in almost all new main menus so that the user can configure the display 
lists individually. 

The main menu "Communication" is a combination of the previous Telephone main menu and 
previous Office main menu. However, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi pairing is not just possible here, but can 
now be performed in all menus. This can be selected under the menu option "Manage mobile 
devices". 

Messages are displayed here in the main menu Communication and in the newly created menu 
Notifications. The difference is that the read messages (SMS text messages, e-mails) disappear 
from the Notifications main menu but remain in the Communication menu. 

The content of the main menu "Navigation” has also been restructured and contains a host of new 
features. The touch screen function of the central information display has been adapted, for example. 
The highlights include the newly designed Micro City Map with a scale of up to 10 m, the learning 
navigation function, the route magnet and route visualization by means of an antenna view as well 
as the road book in split screen mode. Further information on this is provided in the "G12 Navigation 
system" training manual. 

The main menu "ConnectedDrive" has been kept as a separate menu. The ConnectedDrive 
services are now no longer "nested" in folders like in the predecessor head units, as was the case for 
BMW Online, for example. All ConnectedDrive services are now contained in a clear list. This list can 
also be personalized by means of the "Personalize menu" option. Apps are now started automatically 

from the iPhone after they have been accessed once. (The last-accessed app is stored by the 
system and is activated again when the system is started again). In addition, the apps can now also 
be connected with the vehicle via a Bluetooth connection alternatively to connection via the USB 
connection. 

The "My Vehicle" menu combines the previous menus Vehicle info and Settings. The settings are 
divided into vehicle settings and system settings. Further details on this are provided in the "G12 
Displays and Controls training manual". 

The "Notifications" menu” is a notification center for all message such as e-mails, SMS text 
messages, Concierge Service and, as a new feature, also Check Control messages. Only new 
notifications are displayed here that have been sent to the vehicle and not yet read. 

A new "Favorites" menu can be selected by double-clicking on the direct access key MENU 
on the controller. The last-selected menu items are then displayed here for selection.

4.2.1. Introduction to radio functions 

In the G12, radio reception for FM/AM is offered via the familiar phase diversity system with a tuner in 
the head unit. The FM/AM system in the G12 is realized in combination with an antenna amplifier and 
the antennas in the rear window of the vehicle. FM/AM are included in the basic equipment.

4.3. Media/Player functions 


4.3.1. History and new perspective 

A radio was initially installed in the vehicle exclusively for reception and reproduction of FM/AM signals 
in the vehicle. This changed with the installation of the first head units in vehicles as from 2002 as 
everything was now combined in one device. In addition to familiar devices such as a CD/DVD drive 
and the radio tuners, the navigation system was now also included in the head unit (inbox). Access 
to the CD/DVD changer was also possible. Information was now displayed in a Central Information 
Display (CID) and no longer on a small segment display like that used for the radio. With the extension 
to include external devices in the following years, there were then countless possibilities for audio 
playback available to the customer. 

Customers could now receive, play back, play back "from external source" and stream via Bluetooth 
audio. A list of all possibilities of playback via an external device available up to now is provided in the 
"G12 Telephone and telematic systems" training manual. The "G12 Telephone and telematic system" 
training manual is very well suited for this since ULF-SBX High or Combox were the connectivity 
interface in the vehicle for a long time. This applies to both USB connection (2007) as well as the first 
Bluetooth audio streaming (2010) and the first App function (2010). 

These functions (both USB from external source as well as Bluetooth audio and Apps) have been 
integrated in the head unit since 07/12, including the responsible hardware in the form of the Combox 
multimedia. This means that all connectivity/player functions are now combined in the head unit. In the 
new G12, the list of options for connection/streaming has even been extended further. This means that 
a separate training manual would be needed in order to explain all the possibilities in detail. 

Another possibility is to change the perspective. Instead of listing all the functions of a device as in the 
past and thus showing all the possibilities at once, we will now consider the result from the customer's 
point of view. It is the customer who decides with which medium or function he would like to play back 
audio, images, video or apps.

As a result, the focus is instead on the playback options for Audio (music, audio books, etc.), Images 
(customer images, images for media), Film+Video ( DVD, video file, etc.) or Apps (BMW Connected 
App or third-party provider). The new user interface (ID5++) of the Headunit High 2 also speaks in 
favour of this philosophy as it offers the option to hide functions that are not used (chapter Operating 
concept). This results in the following table, including the new features for G12:

In addition, Bluetooth audio 
also supports the Accessory

devices (iPod , iPhone etc.). 

A 

AVRCP 1.4 has been offered 
in the head units Headunit 
Basic and Headunit High 
since 07/13. Since this 
protocol is implemented very 
differently by the smartphone 
manufacturers and this 
can lead to problems in the 
vehicle, it was decided not 
to implement AVRCP 1.4 
for the series launch. The 
series launch will therefore 
take place with AVRCP 1.3 
for the Headunit High. Work 
is urgently being carried out 
on developing a solution for 
stable implementation of 
AVRCP 1.4. 

The solution had not yet 
been decided at the editorial 
closing date. More information 
regarding this topic is coming 
in 2016.

in larger markets up to four times a year from 2015. In smaller markets once a year. Sometimes, the 
road maps change by up to 15 % each year. This is why an update makes sense for every customer. In 
the ASAP portal, a product information bulletin is created for every map release. The bulletin provides 
detailed information about the respective changes to the predecessor version. The current map data 
can be ordered by the parts technician via the Electronic Parts Catalogue (EPC):

A detailed description on how the map data Road Map EVO for the Headunit High 2 is fully (FULL 
Map update) or partially (Automatic Map update) updated can be found in the next chapter. 

In the Drive Options menu of the navigation, the current version of the installed map data is visible 
under the menu item "Version of navigation system". Furthermore, in the service acceptance the key 
data can be read out. The road map currently installed is then displayed. 


4.6. Map data updates 


4.6.1. Introduction 

With the introduction of the Headunit High 2, there are now several ways to update the map data 
of the head unit: 

• Update in BMW Service 

• Updating by the customer 

• Automatic updating 

What is new is that with the start of the Headunit High 2 together with Navigation (SA 609), 

a 3 three-year map subscription is included. 

The map data is updated here up to four times per year, whereby a distinction is made between a 
Full Map update (update of the complete map data on the hard disk drive) and the automatic map 
update. The Full Map update (for e.g. Europe) can be carried out in the conventional way using a USB 
stick or via the BMW programming system. The difference is that the data must be uploaded onto the 
USB stick (up to 2019). 

The automatic map update takes place by means of the SIM card installed in the vehicle only for the 
respective home region (e.g. Germany). The automatic map update function is planned for the markets 
DE, ES, FR, IT, NL, GB, US, CA and CN.

4.6.2. Updating by the workshop 

Updating the map data remains unchanged for BMW Service. BMW Service can load the map data 
either via the USB interface or via the BMW diagnosis/programming system. 

Transfer of the map data via the USB interface in the vehicle is performed using a USB stick onto 
which the service technician has copied the map data himself. The data is copied to the USB stick 
from a workshop PC via a copy web console.

4.6.3. Updating by the customer 

The customer can update his map data himself. 

Alternatives for the customer 

• Data transfer via the vehicle's USB interface using a self-created USB stick (Full Map update) 
in conjunction with the ConnectedDrive Portal/Store. There will be complete map data 
packages on a quarterly basis which will be made available to the customer for download via 
the ConnectedDrive portal. 

• Data transfer via the vehicle's USB interface by means of the USB stick (Full Map updates, 
map data EVO) available from BMW Parts probably as from 2019. Alternatively, the customer 
can have the current map data transferred to the vehicle by BMW Service subject to payment 
of the working time (Chapter 4.7.1). 


ConnectedDrive Portal/Store 

The ConnectedDrive Store has been offered in combination with the ConnectedDrive portal since 
the end of 2014. 

https://www.bmw-connecteddrive.com 

A prerequisite for this is that the vehicle is "mapped". In other words, the vehicle is assigned to the 
customer's ConnectedDrive account. Successful mapping is visible in the header with the currently 
displayed customer vehicle and the correct VIN. 

In this ConnectedDrive store, basic and individual services can be called up using the "Ordered 
services" button. As from the middle of 2015, the map update function will be visible in the submenu 
Basic services. 

The menu options "Automatic map update" and "Manual map update" (Full Map update) will then be 
available.

From 2019, the first map data updates for the Headunit High 2 (map data EVO) will be available for the 
customer via a USB stick available in BMW Parts. The first 3-year map subscriptions will expire in the 
middle of 2018.

4.6.4. Automatic updating 

Partial update 

An "automatic update" takes place via data streaming with an incremental map data update, without 
the customer having to initiate anything. Incremental means that only a certain part of the map is 
updated. 


45 


















G12 Audio Systems

A prerequisite for this is an online connection via an active SIM card in the vehicle. The hardware of 
the SIM card is located in Telematic Communication Box 2 TCB2. You can find details on the TCB2 in 
the "G12 Telephone and telematic systems" training manual. 



TCB2 roof-mounted version in the G12 


With an activated SIM card, the ConnectedDrive Services become active with the customer's 
signature on the "Get Connected" form after activation by BMW AG. 

The automatic update is effected without intervention from the customer, i.e. the customer does not 
have to start the update process manually.

There will be only one update region for Germany. No matter whether the customer lives in the north, 
south, east, west or middle of Germany, only the entire map of Germany will be updated with the 
automatic update. The rest of the European map on the head unit is not affected by the automatic 
update. For customers living in the neighboring regions, a full map update of the entire map of Europe 
is also offered. 

In Europe, it is planned to have a common automatic update for customers in Austria, Switzerland, 
Liechtenstein, Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia, for example. An individual solution will therefore be 
offered for each country or region in Europe. 

There are also these individual solutions for the automatic update in North America. At the moment, 
approximately 11 states/regions in the US are planned for the automatic update. Among others, a 
region with the New England states and one with Canada and Alaska. 

The exact division of which countries/regions are summarized in automatic update regions was not 
known at the time of the editorial deadline.

Example of automatic map updating 

The minimum requirement for automatic updating is that terminal 15 is active. 


If the updating is cancelled (for e.g. no data connection or end of the journey), the updating is 
continued as soon as terminal 15 is active again and the vehicle has re-established a data connection 
to the BMW server. 


4.6.5. Loading the enabling code 

The repair or initial enabling code FSC is still available in the ASAP portal. However, the length of 
the repair code or initial enabling code will change. Instead of 21 characters, an over 100-character 
code will now be required. However, a new process allows this to be accessed on the ASAP portal, 
saved on a USB stick and loaded into the head unit. FSC input via the BMW diagnosis system or BMW 
programming system is still possible.

5.3.2. Bowers & Wilkens 

Bowers & Wilkins (B&W) is a company that was founded by John Bowers and Roy Wilkins in England 
in 1996 under the name B&W Electronics. The company mainly develops and manufactures speakers 
in the mid and high price segment that are used in homes as well as studios. 

Since 2008, Bowers & Wilkins has also served the computer and wireless segment with its New Media 
series. The most well-known product in this series is the Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin, which received 
the EISA Award 2008-2009 as "Best Product" in the sound station segment. 

The most well-known speaker from the company is the Nautilus from 1993. The housing in the form 
of a snail shell accommodates a 4-way system with separate active crossover system. The speaker is 
the first to use the so-called Nautilus tube technology, where the sound radiated by the speaker to the 
rear of the housing is absorbed by the reverse-tapered horn geometry. This avoids superposition of 
noise produced in the housing and drivers on the music signal. In the 800 Diamond series introduced 
in 2010, all speakers are equipped with tweeters made of industrial diamonds. 



"Bowers & Wilkins" logo and the Nautilus active speaker system 


The cooperation between BMW and Bowers & Wilkins now starts with the G12. The customer can 
order the optional equipment High End System Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System 
(SA6F1). A component overview in the bird's eye view of the G12 is provided below.

The Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System differs visually from conventional audio 
systems through 2 center speakers in the instrument panel with illuminated Bowers & Wilkens logo. 


All B&W speakers in the vehicle are protected by special stainless steel perforated covers. The light 
staging in the vehicle is created by the LED-illuminated speakers, which create a three-dimensional 
effect by means of the special hole pattern in the stainless steel covers.

Light staging with the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System 


In contrast to the predecessor High End system, the light staging is not controlled by the High End 
amplifier but by the Light Effect Manager (LEM) control unit used for the first time by BMW. 


The Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System impresses acoustically with optimized 
sound playback to all seats for stereo and multi-channel audio formats. 

It is possible to choose between 5 sound profiles developed by the Swedish company Dirac . 


60 




G12 Audio Systems 
5. Speakers and Amplifiers 



Overview of sound profiles of the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System 


Studio: In Studio mode a frequency and phase correction of the speakers takes place. In this the 
signal is modified in both time and in the frequency range in order to compensate for various time 
delays and sound reflections in the vehicle depending on seating position. This leads to a linear and 
correctly timed playback in the passenger compartment. Through the signal fidelity formed in this 
way an exceptionally diverse and lively sound experience is created for all occupants. An undistorted 
impression is created as if you were present at the original recording in the sound studio. 


Concert: The Concert mode ensures an open and lively spatial effect through special sound field 
modulation in the passenger compartment. This inspires the illusion that the speakers have been 
replaced by virtual speakers and have been moved outwards. It is similar to a music experience in 
a large concert hall. 


61 








G12 Audio Systems 

5. Speakers and Amplifiers 

On Stage: Here, the Concert mode is modified to create the impression of being on stage among the 
musicians instead of in the concert hall. 

Cinema: The G12 is equipped with a DVD player in the head unit and a Blu-Ray player in the rear seat 

entertainment system. It is additionally possible to stream films from a USB stick or an Android cell 
phone. The Cinema mode is optimized for this film playback mode. The Cinema mode creates a sound 
distribution with special Surround Sound like in the cinema. 

Lounge: This mode is specially designed for rear passenger compartment occupants. The sound of 
the entire vehicle is optimally tailored to the rear seats.

5.3.3. Speakers of the High End system 

All speakers (tweeters, mid-range and bass speakers) are connected directly to the audio amplifier or 
via an analog frequency diplexer. The speaker highlights of the High End system are shown below:

The tweeters in the front area (center or right and left in the mirror triangle) of the vehicle are 
equipped with tweeters made of industrial diamond. The extreme hardness of the diamond coating 
ensures extreme pulse fidelity and linearity even in the highest frequency ranges. The Nautilus™ spiral 
technology is used for the tweeters. Sound waves radiated to the rear of the housing are absorbed by 
the horn channels at the rear of the tweeter. 

The tweeters in the rear doors and storage shelf have high-quality aluminium diaphragms. 

The mid-range speakers are accommodated in an almost vibration-free die-cast aluminium housing 
and are equipped with a very high-quality neodymium magnet with the highest field strength values. 

The diaphragm is made of Kevlar , a very light and extremely strong plastic fiber made of synthetic 
aramid fibers (man-made performance fibers). 

The bass speakers are installed under the front seats as central bass speakers. The diaphragms 

made of Rohacell foam are produced with several sandwich layers. This makes the diaphragm 
extremely rigid, which benefits sound output in the low frequency ranges. The neodymium magnets 
are also used for the bass speakers. 

Analog frequency diplexers are installed in the front doors of the G12 in combination with the 
Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System. These separate the high and mid-range 
frequencies more precisely and with a better sound result than is possible using a single capacitor 
mounted on the speaker.

5.3.4. High End amplifier (AMPT) 

The high-end audio amplifier is a control unit in the MOST network. It is a Class D amplifier with 
1200 W output power. 

The Class D audio output stages of the High End audio amplifier have a significantly higher efficiency 
than conventional Class A, B, or AB amplifiers. The power losses compared with conventional audio 
output stages are minimized by pulse width modulation and switched-mode transistors. A continuous 
voltage characteristic corresponding to the input signal is generated by a low-pass filter after the 
power stage.

5.3.5. Microphone 

The speed-dependent volume adjustment function used in other speaker systems (Speed Volume) 
is realized in the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System by means of a microphone in 
the vehicle interior. The microphone also helps control equalizing for the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond 
Surround Sound System. The function is called Dynamic Equalizing Control. 

The automatic adaptation takes place independently of the noise that can be heard in the passenger 
compartment, such as driving and wind noise. These are measured with the help of a microphone. 

The microphone on the driver' side is used as a microphone for volume adjustment and equalizing. 



The microphone on the driver's side (left-hand drive vehicle) is used for the High End audio system in the G12

If the microphone or High End amplifier (AMPT) is replaced, the microphone must be recalibrated 
with the BMW diagnosis system.

The engine control unit controls the Active Sound Design (ASD) of the vehicle using characteristic 
data such as engine speed, load or driving speed. The ASD generates the optimum sound design 
for the respective driving profile and forwards these sound files to the speaker system in the vehicle 
interior via the hi-fi amplifier. 

The ASD can be temporarily deactivated during a test drive (noise analysis drive) by means of the 
BMW diagnosis system ISTA. However, permanent deactivation of the ASD is not possible. If the ASD 
is deactivated using the BMW diagnosis system with the ISTA function "ASD muting ON", the ASD will 
remain switched off only until the next terminal change.
