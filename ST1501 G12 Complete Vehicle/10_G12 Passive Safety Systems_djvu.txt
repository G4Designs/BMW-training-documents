G12 Passive Safety Systems 

1. Introduction 

1.1. The hidden protector 

The passive safety system of the G12 is based on the objectives and characteristics of current BMW 
models. The passive safety system fulfils all legislative requirements worldwide. 

The restraint systems ensure that the risk of injury is reduced. 

A 5th generation Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) is used as the central airbag control unit for 
the passive safety system in the G12. In contrast to other series, with the passive safety system of the 
G12 the central sensor system is integrated in the ACSM control unit and not in the Integrated Chassis 
Management (ICM). This is possible with the G12 as the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) is located in the 
center of vehicle. 

The ACSM 5 of the G12 is a bus user in the FlexRay. The sensor data of the central sensor system 
which was previously provided by the Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) can be transmitted 
directly by the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) via FlexRay to the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC).

3. Functions 

3.1. Functions of Crash Safety Module 

The function of the Crash Safety Module is to permanently evaluate all sensor signals in order to 
identify a crash situation. Based on the sensor signals and their evaluation, the Crash Safety Module 
(ACSM) identifies the direction of the crash and the severity of the impact. 

The Crash Safety Module (ACSM) evaluates the sensor information and then initiates the relevant 
measures for selective activation of the necessary restraint systems. 

At the same time the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) monitors the system itself and indicates when it is 
ready for operation by switching off the airbag indicator light. 

If an error occurs during operation this is stored in a fault memory The fault memory can be read out 
for diagnosis purposes. 

If a crash situation is detected, a crash message is sent to the other bus users in the data bus network 
as notification. The relevant control units respond to this signal by executing their own activities 
according to the severity of the crash. 

The activities include: 

• Opening the central locking system 

• Activating the hazard warning flasher 

• Switching on the interior light 

• Making an emergency call 

An additional function of the Crash Safety Module is the acoustic seat belt warning that reminds the 
driver using visual and acoustic signals to fasten his seat belt. With help of a seat belt buckle switch it 
is determined whether the driver has fastened his seat belt. Furthermore, for vehicles in the US version 
the position of the driver and the front passenger seat is monitored. 

The functions of the Crash Safety Module generally belong to one of the following areas: 

• Crash-relevant functions 

• System monitoring functions 

• Additional convenience functions 

3.2. Crash-relevant functions 

The Crash Safety Module must fulfil the following crash-relevant functions: 

• Evaluating the sensor signals 

• Impact detection 

• Determining actuators to be activated 

• Specifying the trigger time and trigger sequence 

• Activation of the ignition circuit output stages

3.2.1. Evaluating the sensor signals 

The sensors serve to identify and verify front-end, side-on and rear-end crashes and also as roll-over 
detection. 

The sensors are located in the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) or are directly connected to the Crash 
Safety Module, where their signals are evaluated and processed. 


3.2.2. Impact detection 

The US version of the vehicles is equipped with the following sensors: 

• one lateral and one longitudinal acceleration sensor in the B-pillars (green). 

• one airbag sensor to monitor the pressure in each of the front doors (blue). 

• one lateral and one longitudinal acceleration sensor in the ACSM (yellow). 

• one roll rate sensor in the ACSM (yellow). 

• one vertical acceleration sensor in the ACSM (yellow). 

• one front sensor on each of the engine supports (red). 

The airbag sensors in the doors assist with the identification of a side-on crash. 

The airbag front sensors assist with the identification of a head-on crash and its corresponding 
severity.

G12 Passive Safety Systems 

3. Functions 

3.2.3. Trigger time and trigger sequence 

The Crash Safety Module uses the values transmitted by the sensors to determine the direction and 
severity of the crash. 

In the case of a head-on crash, correspondingly high acceleration values must be detected for example 
by the longitudinal acceleration sensors in the rear side panels and by the longitudinal acceleration 
sensor in the Crash Safety Module (ACSM). An algorithm determines the severity and direction of the 
crash based on the accelerations. This information is used to assist calculation of the activation times 
and sequence in which the restraint systems are activated. 

A possible imminent rollover is also detected and the appropriate protection systems are energized. 

3.2.4. Activation of the ignition circuit output stages 

The Crash Safety Module is supplied by the power distribution box on the rear right using terminal 
30B. The Crash Safety Module (ACSM) is in offline mode with terminal 30B. This means that it is 
active on the data bus and can perform all diagnostic functions. 

Activation of the ignition circuits is blocked and is available as of the "Residing" driving condition once 
the system self-test is complete. The Crash Safety Module (ACSM) is also ready for ignition in the 
"Driving" driving condition. 

The ignition capacitors are recharged via a switching controller. These ignition capacitors make the 
firing energy available in the event of a crash. If the voltage supply is interrupted during a crash, the 
ignition capacitors serve briefly as an energy reserve. 

The ignition circuit output stages consist of a high-side and a low-side power switch. The high-side 
power switch connects the ignition voltage, while the low-side power switch connects to the ground. 
The ignition circuit output stages are controlled by a microcontroller. 

The high-side and low-side power switches also serve to check the ignition circuits during the system 
self-test. 


3.2.5. Sending the crash message 

In the event of a collision involving activation of the restraint systems, the Crash Safety Module 
(ACSM) sends a crash signal to the bus users in the data bus network. 

The Telematic Communication Box 2 (TCB2) is actuated in parallel via a direct single-wire connection. 
The Telematic Communication Box 2 (TCB2) is the follow-on telematics control unit to the Telematic 
Communication Box (TCB). The TCB2 acts as a data modem in the vehicle and has one or two data 
aerials as well as a connection to an emergency aerial. This can be used to establish a telephone 
connection via the connected vehicle microphone even if the vehicle has rolled over. A built-in SIM 
card inside the control unit makes these emergency calls possible.

3.2.6. Crash documentation 

In the event of a collision where one or more actuators are activated, a crash entry is stored in a non¬ 
erasable memory. After five crash entries, a non-erasable fault code entry is stored together with the 
information that the five crash messages have been saved. The airbag indicator light also lights up 
continuously. 

A 

The five crash entries could also be stored during the course of an accident. Each crash entry is 
assigned a system time. The control unit remains ignitable even after five crash entries. The crash 
entries cannot be erased and serve the purpose of subsequent device diagnosis. A maximum of five 
crash entries can be saved. The control unit must then be replaced. 


3.2.7. Emergency call function 

The emergency call functions are country-specific and are available to customers in countries with 
ConnectedDrive Services infrastructure. An emergency call requires an active SIM card 
in the Telematic Communication Box 2 (TCB2) and an available mobile phone network. 

The emergency call button is connected directly to the Telematic Communication Box 2 (TCB2). 

The manual emergency call allows the driver to request assistance in the event of a medical 
emergency. 


3.3. System monitoring functions 

The Crash Safety Module has the following system monitoring functions: 

• System self-test (pre-drive check). 

• Display of system operability. 

• Cyclic monitoring. 

• Fault display and fault storage. 

• Output of faults (diagnosis). 


14 










G12 Passive Safety Systems 

3. Functions 


Acoustic and visual seat belt warning. 

Deactivation of the front passenger airbag and side airbag on the passenger's 
side in European version vehicles (only vehicles with (OE 5DA)). 

Deactivation of the front passenger airbag and side airbag and knee airbag on 
the passenger's side and the knee airbag in the US version of the vehicles. 


3.3.1. System self test 

The Crash Safety Module (ACSM) performs a system self-test after a terminal change has been made 
as of the "Residing" driving condition. The airbag indicator light is activated for roughly five seconds 
during the system self test. 

Once the system self-test is complete and no faults have been identified, the airbag indicator light 
goes out and the system is operational. 

3.3.2. Display of system operability 

The airbag indicator light in the instrument panel goes out to indicate that the Crash Safety Module 
is ready for operation. 

3.3.3. Cyclic monitoring 

Once the system self-test has been successfully concluded and the system is ready for operation, 
a cyclic monitoring procedure is performed for fault monitoring purposes. This cyclical monitoring 
serves the internal diagnosis of the control unit and overall airbag system. Cyclical monitoring takes 
place continuously as of the "Residing" driving condition. It is also continued after a terminal change 
has been made as of the "Driving" driving condition. 

3.3.4. Fault display and fault storage 

The Crash Safety Module (ACSM) has a non-volatile fault memory. The airbag indicator light lights 
up to indicate a fault entry. 

Events such as the activation of an airbag or retractor tensioner are also stored in the fault memory. 

A 

If the fault memory contains the entry that the restraint system has been activated, this only means 
the ignited restraint system is not available for further activation and not that it malfunctioned during 
the crash. 


3.3.5. Output of faults (diagnosis) 

The fault memory can be read out via the diagnostic interface with the assistance of the Integrated 
Service Technical Application ISTA in the BMW diagnosis system. After rectifying the faults or after 
replacing activated components, the fault memory can be cleared with the diagnosis command 
"Clear fault memory".

G12 Passive Safety Systems 

3. Functions 


3.3.6. Acoustic and visual seat belt warning 

An acoustic and visual seat belt warning is a standard feature of all vehicles equipped with the Crash 
Safety Module (ACSM). The Crash Safety Module (ACSM) records whether or not the driver or front 
passenger have fastened their seat belts. If they have not, an acoustic and visual warning is output 
to remind them to fasten their seatbelts. Both seat belt buckle switches are monitored separately. 
Depending on the national-market version and optional equipment, seat belt buckle switches are also 
installed in the rear passenger compartment and a seat belt warning is issued accordingly for the rear 
seat passengers. 

3.3.7. Deactivating the airbag 

CIS mat 

Provision is made in US versions of the vehicles for the airbag to be deactivated automatically in order 
to satisfy the regulations of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA. When the child 
seats listed in the regulation are occupied by a child this must lead to deactivation of the airbag. 

To do so, a seat occupancy mat is used on the front passenger seat for the purpose of occupancy 
detection and classification of occupants in the front passenger seat. A Capacitive Interior Sensing 
mat (CIS mat) is used in the G12. 

The CIS mat is made up of two elements: A sensor wire, which runs parallel to the seat heating in 
the seat cushion, and an evaluation unit. The CIS mat measures the capacity and ohmic resistance 
between the sensor wire (anode) and the vehicle ground (cathode) at a frequency of 120 kHz. The 
CIS mat determines from the change in capacity and resistance whether the front passenger seat is 
occupied by an adult or a child in a child seat. 

The deactivation of the front passenger airbag, the side airbag and knee airbag on the passenger's 
side is signalled by the indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation. 

The indicator lamp for front passenger airbag deactivation in the roof function center lights up if a 
child seat with child (for example a child restraint system that has been tested in accordance with the 
NHTSA regulations and is holding a small child on the front passenger seat) was detected or if the 
front passenger seat is unoccupied. 


3.4. Active protection 

The standard equipment of the G12 already contains the Active Protection safety package (OE 5AL). 

The Active Protection safety package (OE 5AL) comprises the following three functionally 
independent subsystems: 

• PreCrash 

• PostCrash 

• Alertness assistant 

The Active Protection safety package (OE 5AL) increases the safety of the occupants through 
preventative measures in the event of critical driving situations (PreCrash) and through measures after 
a crash (PostCrash). The attention assist monitors the driving style of the driver during a trip 
and encourages the driver to take breaks if necessary.

3.4.2. PreCrash 

The PreCrash subsystem introduces preventative protective measures for the occupants in known 
critical driving situations which may lead to an accident. 

Identification of critical driving situations 

Critical driving situations are identified with help of the inertial sensor system installed in the vehicle. 
Critical driving situations include: 

• Emergency braking initiated 

• Strong understeer 

• Strong oversteer 

• Rollover of the vehicle 

For vehicles with the optional Driving Assistance Plus (Package ZDB) which includes Active Driving 
Assistant (OE 5AS) and Active Driving Assistant Plus (OE 5AT) imminent collisions that have 
been detected with help of the radar sensor system and KAFAS stereo camera. For the PreCrash 
identification, separate thresholds to the collision warning thresholds are made available by the KAFAS 
or radar sensor system for activating the PreCrash functions.

3.4.3. PostCrash 

The PostCrash subfunction includes the automatic braking function after an accident, which brakes 
the vehicle to a standstill in certain accident situations without intervention from the driver. The risk of 
another collision can thus be reduced. The driver may oversteer the automatic braking after a crash by 
pressing the brake pedal or accelerator pedal. 

The automatic braking after a crash is activated if a crash with sufficient severity has been identified 
in the Crash Safety Module (ACSM). The Crash Safety Module (ACSM) then sends a signal to the 
electronic fuel pump control unit (EKPS) to switch off the fuel pump. This same signal is evaluated by 
the DSC control unit. The DSC control unit then brakes the vehicle with help of the DSC pump and 
brings it to a standstill. 

The DSC generates a setpoint deceleration of 5 m/s2 for braking. The setpoint deceleration is only 
achieved if road conditions permit this. During automatic braking the accelerator pedal and brake 
pedal are monitored. The automatic braking is interrupted if the accelerator pedal is pressed or if the 
brake pedal is pressed for a longer period by the driver. Pressing the accelerator pedal only causes the 
braking process to stop. Acceleration of the vehicle is not possible as the fuel pump is switched off. 

Also during automatic braking the ABS prevents the wheels from blocking and the DSC stabilizes the 
vehicle. If the DSC is in DSC OFF mode during automatic braking, a forced activation of the DSC is 
effected. 

Approx. 1.5 seconds after reaching standstill, the brake is automatically released and the vehicle must 
be secured against rolling away. 

If a crash is detected, which leads to activation of the safety battery terminal, then automatic braking 
cannot be activated as the DSC pump is no longer supplied with power. 

Automatic braking is not activated under the following conditions: 

• The DSC has failed before the crash. 

• The ABS has failed before the crash. 

• The brake fluid level is too low. 

If these faults occur during or after the crash, the control is led to the end as these faults are then 
interpreted as consequences of the crash.

4.1. Crash Safety Module 

In the G12 the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) is located centrally in the vehicle under the center 
console between the two front seats. The central sensor system is integrated in the Crash Safety 
Module (ACSM).

4.2. Sensors and switches 


4.2.1. Lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensor 

The lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensors assist with the identification of head-on crashes, 
side-on crashes and rear-end crashes. 

The airbag sensor consists of a longitudinal acceleration sensor and a lateral acceleration sensor. 
The acceleration sensors measure the positive and negative acceleration in the X and Y direction. 
The resulting value from the X and Y signal is decisive in identifying the direction of the crash. The 
airbag sensors assist with the identification of head-on, side-on and rear-end crashes. The airbag 
sensors on the left and right are of identical design and are allocated by way of mechanical encoding 
during installation.

4.2.2. Door pressure sensor 

In the G12 pressure sensors are installed in the driver's door and front passenger door. The pressure 
sensors in the doors are now no longer attached with a bolt as was previously the case, but instead are 
screwed into the bracket (inner door panel) and the electrical connections and plug connections can 
only be connected once the relevant sensors have been installed. 

Side crashes are identified with the assistance of the airbag sensors. In addition to the lateral 
acceleration values that are present, the pressure in the door cavity also increases in the event of a 
side-on crash. 

The airbag sensors in the doors are used to verify the plausibility of the acceleration signals from 
the B-pillar airbag sensors and the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) when a side-on crash is detected. 
The airbag sensors are situated in the inner panel of the doors and measure the pressure increase in 
the event of a side-on collision. In the event of a side-on collision at the door the outer skin is pushed 
inwards. The door interior is reduced in size and the inner pressure increases. This pressure change 
is measured by the airbag sensors. The airbag sensor also includes electronics, in addition to the 
pressure sensor, that digitise the pressure readings and transmit them cyclically to the Crash Safety 
Module (ACSM). The data transfer is effected analogue to the airbag sensors in the B-pillars. 

The pressure readings are evaluated in the Crash Safety Module (ACSM).

4.2.3. Airbag front sensor 

Two front sensors are installed in the front area. The measured values are forwarded to the Crash 
Safety Module (ACSM) where they are evaluated. 

The airbag front sensors on the left and right assist with the identification of a head-on crash. 

The sensors deliver additional information to the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) on the characteristics 
and severity of the collision. Each sensor contains an acceleration sensor for recording the 
deceleration, signal processing technology and electronics for data transfer. The measured values are 
sent in the form of a message to the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) and are used in the calculation of 
the algorithm.

4.2.4. Sensors in the ACSM 

In the G12, the central sensor system is integrated in the Crash Safety Module (ACSM). The Crash 
Safety Module (ACSM) contains a longitudinal and lateral acceleration sensor, a vertical acceleration 
sensor and a roll rate sensor for impact detection. The Crash Safety Module (ACSM) also includes a 
longitudinal and lateral acceleration sensor and a yaw sensor for the driving dynamics control. 

The sensor data for impact detection is evaluated in the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) and helps to 
identify side-on, rear-end or head-on crashes and assists with roll-over detection. The sensor data not 
yet evaluated for the driving dynamics control is sent to the DSC control unit via FlexRay where it is 
processed.

4.2.5. CIS mat 

The capacitive interior sensing mat (CIS mat) is fitted in the front passenger seat. The CIS mat detects 
whether the front passenger seat is occupied by an adult or a by child in a child seat. The deactivation 
of the front passenger airbag, the side airbag and the knee airbag on the passenger's side is signalled 
by the indicator light for front passenger airbag deactivation. 

4.2.6. Seat belt buckle switch 

The seat belt buckle switches are located in the seat belt buckles of the driver and front passenger 
seat. 

The seat belt buckle switch detects whether the seat belt buckle tongue is in the seat belt buckle. The 
Crash Safety Module (ACSM) supplies power to the sensors and performs the evaluation. As of driving 
readiness, the seat belt buckle switch is permanently monitored and used for the visual and acoustic 
seat belt warning and also to determine which restraint systems are to be triggered.

4.2.8. Seat-position sensors 

In accordance with the US legal requirement (FMVSS208), a height identification for the person in 
the driver and front passenger seat must be effected. This height identification is effected via the 
adjustment travel of the forward/back seat adjustment. In US-version vehicles, the exact position is 
identified using the seat-position sensors for the driver and front passenger seats. 

The job of the seat-position detector is to distinguish between a relatively small person and a person 
of normal height within the lengthways adjustment range of the seat. This detection is another 
technical feature aimed at increasing the safety of the occupants. The deployment of the two airbag 
stages is then adjusted to the driver's/front passenger's seat position. 

The seat-position detector takes the form of a 2-wire hall effect sensor and is supplied with power via 
the Crash Safety Module (ACSM). The current level of the seat-position sensor changes depending on 
the seat position.

4.3.2. Driver's airbag 

The purpose of the driver's airbag is to reduce the risk of injury to the driver in combination with the 
seat belt when a front-end crash occurs. The driver's airbag is located in the steering wheel impact 
plate. The driver's airbag is equipped with a gas generator. 

A two-stage gas generator is installed which can be used to activate the stages at short or long time 
differences, depending on the severity of the crash detected and taking into consideration the seat 
position. 

In addition, the driver's airbag features an active vent valve.

4.3.3. Front passenger airbag 

The purpose of the front passenger airbag is to reduce the risk of accident to the front passenger in 
the event of a front-end crash. The front passenger airbag is located in the dashboard. When the front 
passenger airbag expands, the dashboard tears open at defined points. 

A two-stage gas generator is installed which can be used to activate the stages at short or long time 
differences, depending on the severity of the crash detected and taking into consideration the seat 
position. 

The front passenger airbag features an active vent valve.

4.3.4. Knee airbag 

The US standards (laws) contain requirements on the passive restraint of occupants (without seatbelt). 
This is why in the US version of the vehicles a knee airbag is also required on the driver's side and 
passenger's side to control the forwards displacement of the occupant(s) in the event of a head-on 
crash.

4.3.5. Head airbag 

Head airbags are installed in the G12 to protect the occupants' heads in the event of a side collision. 

The head airbag extends from the A-pillar to the C-pillar and covers the entire area of the side 
windows. It expands between the occupants and side structure. 

System features: 

• Extended covered area across all front and rear side windows. 

• Protection of occupants from glass splinters. 

• Covered area for different-sized occupants optimized. 



G12 head airbag 


4.3.6. Side airbag 

As with all current BMW models, the side airbag at the front ignites out of the front seat backrest. 

The side airbags and gas generators are accommodated in a plastic housing, the airbag module. 
This is installed in the front seat backrest and is concealed by the seat cover. 

If activated, the side airbag emerges outwards from the backrest frame and spreads between 
the side structure and occupant. 

A_ 

It is important to ensure that no additional seat covers are fitted as they would greatly impair the 
function of the side airbag, or even immobilize it altogether.

4.3.7. Automatic tensioner with adaptive force limiter 

An automatic reel with adaptive force limiter for the driver and front passenger is installed in the G12. 
With the aid of a gas generator, there is a changeover from a high to a low power level during the 
impact, in order to reduce the seat belt restraining forces. 

When optimally harmonised with the airbag, it ensures the kinetic energy acting on the occupants is 
more evenly dissipated for the duration of the crash. Thus lower occupant stress values are achieved.

4.3.8. Active head restraints, front 

The active head restraint is used in the new BMW 7 Series in conjunction with the multifunction seat. 
This is a head restraint with a pyrotechnic actuator that optimizes the distance and height of the 
headrest in relation to the head if a rear-end collision of sufficient force occurs. This reduces the load 
on the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear-end collision. The head restraint is activated early, even 
prior to backwards displacement of the occupant's head. 

The active head restraint reduces the load in the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear-end collision. 
For the vehicle occupants therefore, correct adjustment of the head restraint and the distance of the 
head from the head restraint is of crucial importance. 

In the event of a rear-end collision, the active head restraint reduces the distance between the head 
and the head restraint before the occupants are displaced backwards. This reduces the danger of 
injury to the cervical vertebrae, even if a minor accident occurs.

Seat or head restraint covers and/or accessories that could impair the protective effect must not be 
mounted on the head restraints. 


4.3.9. Safety battery terminal 

The safety battery terminal (SBK) is triggered at different thresholds when the Crash Safety Module 
(ACSM) detects a head-on, side-on or rear-end crash of sufficient severity. 

Even though the safety battery terminal (SBK) has been disconnected, a voltage supply to all safety¬ 
relevant consumers such as hazard warning lights, interior light, airbag and telephone (including 
emergency call) is ensured. 



G12 safety battery terminal (SBK) 


4.3.10. Airbag indicator light 

The airbag indicator light is located on the instrument panel. The airbag indicator light lights up and 
then goes out during the pre-drive check to signal readiness of the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) and 
passive safety systems. The airbag indicator light is controlled via a message on the FlexRay from 
the Crash Safety Module (ACSM) via the Body Domain Controller (BDC) to the instrument cluster. 
The instrument cluster receives a message cyclically. If the message remains off, the airbag indicator 
light is activated.
