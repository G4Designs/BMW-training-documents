G12 Displays and Controls 

1. Introduction 

1.1. Overview 

The typical BMW display and operating concept is also used in the new BMW 7 Series G12. The main 
features of Drive were kept, such as separation of displays and controls as well as separation of the 
driving functions immediately in front of the driver and the convenience functions integrated in the 
center of the vehicle. 

Greater emphasis of driver orientation is achieved by the driver-facing center stack as well as the 
arrangement of the driver assistance functions on the steering wheel. In addition, the Multifunction 
Steering Wheel (MFL) provides the driver with fast access to the most important communication and 
entertainment functions.

G12 Displays and Controls 

1. Introduction 


With the model launch of the G12, the Central Information Display (CID) has evolved with it’s touch¬ 
screen operating function. There are also additional functions that are controlled by touch operation, 
such as the heating and air conditioning control. 

For the first time, function applications are now also performed by the use of gesture control (SA 6U8). 

Another completely new method of function control in the G12 is the BMW Touch Command (SA 
6U9). The removable tablet PC (BMW Touch Command) replaces the rear compartment controller of 
the F01/F02.

2. Instrument Cluster 

2.1. Introduction 

The BMW 7 Series is fitted with a dynamic digital instrument cluster (SA 6WB). 

The dynamic digital instrument cluster is equipped with a TFT display and therefore allows for 
situation-dependent display of information that is relevant to the driver. This flexible display of 
information achieves a maximum degree of clarity and comfort as well as the following: 

♦ Minimization of driver distraction by optimum arrangement of related functions 
and situation-based displays 

♦ Improvement of the driving experience by the display hierarchy and design 
adapted to the driving situation 

♦ Improved driving comfort through the display of new indicators and functions 
(e.g. picture-in-picture map display on the instrument cluster). 


2.2. Dynamic digital instrument cluster 

The dynamic digital instrument cluster is offered as standard equipment in the G12. 

2.2.1. Display 

The dynamic digital instrument display has a 12.3" TFT display with a resolution of 1920 x 720 pixels 
and covers an extended area of the instrument cluster. This means that is also possible to display the 
fuel and temperature gauges and the needles by means of the TFT display in addition to the speed 
reading and engine speed display.

The virtual image is visible at a distance of around 2.4 m (7.8 ft.) from the eye of the viewer. 

Activation and operation of the new HUD is similar to the predecessor. 

The Head-Up Display is connected to the instrument cluster via an APIX interface. 

The brightness of the Head-Up Display adapts itself to the ambient brightness. This is controlled 
based on the data from the rain-light-solar-condensation sensor (RLSBS). The characteristic curve 
(image brightness in relation to the input signal from the rain-light-solar-condensation sensor) can be 
changed by means of the controller. In addition, the brightness in night mode can also be changed 
manually. 

The image position and image rotation can be adjusted by means of the controller, as before.

allows a technician to perform this as a system test, similar to instrument cluster system test. Please 
note that this mode only operates with the vehicle’s hood closed. 

There are two methods of activating the HUD showroom mode: 

♦ Once the Service Menu is activated, via the controller (see next “Controller” section), a new 
additional menu item named “Start demo” appears in the Head-Up Display menu. When “Start 
demo” is activated, all the displays/features in the HUD will activate. 

♦ Access the Head-Up Display settings menu in the CID. With the check mark “on” to activate 
the HUD and still having it highlighted, press the Controller down 6 times (5 times if the HUD 
was not checked “on” originally) and the showroom mode will activate.

6. Gesture Control 


For the first time, there is function controllability by the use of gesture control (SA 6U8) in the G12. 

Individual functions, such as input of the home address in route guidance, can be carried out 
conveniently by means of a directed movement between the gear selector switch and instrument 
panel. 


6.1. Camera 

The gesture recognition camera is a TOF (Time of Flight) camera which is integrated in the roof 
function center (FZD).

Gesture recognition camera 


6.1.1. Overview 

TOF cameras have an extremely high level of detection sensitivity and are therefore highly suitable for 
gesture recognition and control. 

A TOF camera operates with similar principles as of a radar or echo sounder, which sends out signals 
and is then able to detect their reflections in the surrounding area. With this kind of camera, light 
wavefronts are transmitted into space and the time required for the light to return at this point is 
measured for each sensor pixel. This time measurement is performed based on the "Time of Flight" 
principle. 

Pulse modulation is used for the gesture recognition of the G12. With pulse modulation, a short light 
pulse is emitted and a time measurement is started simultaneously.

6.1.2. Function 

Four (4) infrared LEDs (like those in a TV remote control) illuminate the gesture interaction space in 
a pulsed mode. The gesture recognition camera “sees” the reflected light in the illuminated area and 
calculates the distance by measuring the time-of-flight of the light signal between the camera and 
the reflecting object. This technique is used to generate the 3D image which is required for gesture 
recognition.

G12 Displays and Controls 

9. Driving Experience Switch 

9.6.1. Overview 

The "ADAPTIVE" mode is used for the first time in the BMW 7 Series. It is designed to achieve a 
balanced driving mode where the setup is automatically adapted to both the driving situation and the 
driving style. 

In this mode, the parameters of the Electronic Damper Control (VDP), the Electric Active Roll 
Stabilization (EARS), Electronic Power Steering (EPS) and the automatic transmission, for example, 
are switched between "COMFORT", "SPORT" and “ECO PRO” settings depending on the driving 
situation. However, when "ADAPTIVE" mode is active, no changes that restrict comfort (seat heating, 
A/C settings, etc.) are made in the event of switching to "ECO PRO" mode. 

"ADAPTIVE" reacts to the current driving style. The affected control units can change their 
parameters on the basis of the detected driving style. 

With the navigation system, the mode makes use of the available map data and optimizes "ADAPTIVE" 
mode by predictive functions such as early reaction to bends, junctions and road type. 

The displays on the instrument cluster and Central Information Display (CID) remain in "normal" mode 
and do not continuously change between "COMFORT" and "SPORT" modes. This is to prevent the 
driver from being distracted or lose comfort by changes in the displays. "ADAPTIVE" mode changes 
the modes in the background so that the driver does not notice the changes directly. 

The following influences on the driving style are taken into account, among others: 

♦ Longitudinal dynamics 

♦ Current speed 

♦ Pedal sensor position 

♦ Cruise control (sensor data from ACC radar sensor) 

♦ Sport shift gate for automatic transmission 

♦ Turn indicator 

♦ Steering wheel movements 

♦ Navigation data

9.6.2. Function 

If a driving mode is changed by means of the driving experience switch, this data is sent from the Body 
Domain Controller (BDC) to the responsible control units. The parameter changes in "ADAPTIVE" 
mode are sent by the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) to the responsible control units.

11. Remote Key 

11.1. Overview 

The G12 is supplied with 2 remote keys as the standard equipment configuration. 

Each remote key has a replaceable battery. Depending on the vehicle equipment 
the customer can configure various functions for each remote key. 

A Display key (SA 3DS) is available as optional equipment. 


11.2. Emergency detection 

If there are transmission problems between the transponder of the remote key and the vehicle 
where it is not possible to establish driving readiness, an "emergency detection function" is available. 
The customer is informed about the fact that the remote key has not been detected by means of a 
Check Control message. 

If a corresponding Check Control message is displayed, the remote key must be held against the 
marking on the steering column. The start/stop button must then be pressed immediately after this 
(within a time of around 10 s) with the brake pedal depressed.

This function allows driving readiness to be established if the battery of the remote key is exhausted, 
for example. 


The emergency detection function is possible both for the remote key and for the Display key. 



The transponder of the Display key is located on the rear side at around the level of the lock button 
(BMW badge).

Instead of a standard remote key, the delivery specification of the BMW Display key includes an 
additional mechanical key. The mechanical key should be carried as well if the Display key is used. 


11.3.2. Function 

The Display key supports all functions of the standard remote key, but does not have an integrated 
mechanical key. 

The key also permits status information on various functions to be accessed. The customer has the 
possibility of obtaining information on his vehicle, e.g. the range. 

Certain settings of the vehicle are adopted by the Display key, e.g. date and time format, language or 
units. Up to 27 languages can be displayed on the Display key. 

In the key, the menus are divided up into 4 main menus. These are in turn divided into further 
submenus.

11.3.3. Charging the battery 

Unlike the standard remote key, the Display key has a rechargeable battery. 

The display is automatically switched off if the state of charge of the Display battery (SA 3DS) falls 
to a low level. The operability of the standard buttons is maintained until the battery is fully discharged. 

The display can be completely switched off in order to prolong the battery life. To do this, press the 
On/Off button on the side for longer than 4 s. 

The battery of the Display key (SA 3DS) can be charged as follows: 

♦ Place the Display key (SA 3DS) in the recess of the Wireless charging 
tray (WCA) with the locking button at the top. 

♦ Connect the Display key (SA 3DS) to a USB port (charging connection) 
via the Micro USB port on the left side of the key. 

Please note, that if the Display key is completely discharged, the wireless charging tray will not be 
able to recognize the Display key and charging will not take place. It would be necessary to first have 
a surface charge via the Micro USB before placing the Display key in the wireless charging tray for 
charging.

vehicle before it is received (internally at BMW, the online Owner's Manual can also be accessed on 
the Intranet).
