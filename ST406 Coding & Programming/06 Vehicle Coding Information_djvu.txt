Vehicle Coding Information 

Introduction 

As part of an ongoing process to reduce the need 
for country, model and option specific control 
modules, BMW began to utilize a multi digit vehi¬ 
cle coding structure referred to as a Central 
Coding Key (ZCS) and later changed to a struc¬ 
ture referred to as a Vehicle Order (VO/FA). 

The Central Coding Key (ZCS) is a unique 37 digit (originally a 48 digit) code that con¬ 
tains specific model, country variation and individual equipment/option information fora 
vehicle. 

During the manufacturing process of a vehicle, the ZCS code is created to identify the 
specific vehicle being built and to properly code the control modules installed during the 
assembly process once the vehicle reaches the end of the line. To ensure that the ZCS 
code can be retrieved once the vehicle leaves the factory it is stored in one or two control 
modules, depending on the model. 

ZCS is often referred to as a “key” since it is able to automatically “unlock” or "activate” 
specific functions of a new control module or can be used to recode a used control mod¬ 
ule to be compatible with the specific vehicle it has been installed into. With the intro¬ 
duction of the E31 the ZCS information was used for the first time as a coding key for 
replacement vehicle control modules, this ensured that the replacement modules would 
be coded to the required specification of the vehicle. 

As the number of options & accessories available for installation in a vehicle increased, an 
alternative to the ZCS code was introduced on 9/01 production E46 vehicles. The ZCS 
system was replaced with a system known as the Vehicle Order (VO/FA). The VO is a 
straightforward listing of vehicle specific information including a list of the option codes 
pertaining to the systems or equipment installed in the vehicle and is used in the same 
manner as the ZCS to properly code replacement or additional modules. 

Regardless of which structure is utilized on a vehicle, codeable modules have no limit as 
to the number of times that they can be recoded.

Vehicle Coding Information 




ZCS Structure 


The 37 digit structure of the ZCS is subdivided 
into three segments. The segments represent 
specific information about the vehicle. 

Each segment ends with a checksum “digit”. 

A checksum is utilized by the coding software to 
detect unacceptable/erroneous manually entered 
coding information. 

The information/digits of the ZCS code reflects the options installed in the vehicle and 
should never be changed manually unless it is necessary for special recoding functions 
such as: 

• Canadian market vehicle being moved to the US 

• Retrofit installation of an accessory system (ie. CPT9000 phone system 
or BMW ULF system refer to SI B840103 & B84 08 04) 

If a modification needs to be made to the ZCS structure and there is no information avail¬ 
able in a service bulletin then the BMW Technical Hotline should be contacted for assis¬ 
tance by submitting a PUMA case, requesting a modified ZCS code. 

Each portion of the ZCS provides specific information regarding that vehicle: 

GM (Grundmerkmale) - Identifies the “Basic Features” of the vehicle and contains 

9 digits that are used to describe: 

• Vehicle type (E36, E38, E39 ...) 

• Specific body style of the vehicle (Sedan, Coupe ...) 

• Country specific coding identification (US, UK, ECE ...) 

• Unique equipment that affects the basics of the vehicle 
(with sunroof, without sunroof, wheel size ...) 

• Basic language variant (English, Spanish, German ...) 

SA (Sonderausstattungs) - Identifies the “Special Equipment” of the vehicle and contains 

17 digits that describe what features/functions are installed in 
the vehicle, such as: 

• Power Windows or Manual windows 

• Power Door Locks or Manual Door Locks 

• Power Sunroof or Manual Sunroof 

• Power Convertible Top or Manual Convertible Top 

• Phone Pre-wire 

The SA segment is configured to provide a total of 64 possible number combinations 
(option groups) for all series vehicles worldwide. The information is modified whenever 
a new component/accessory is added to the vehicle via a retrofit coding procedure.

VN (Versionsnummer) - Identifies the “Version Number” of the vehicle and contains 11 

digits that are used to describe: 

• Series specific coding data that are not reflected in the GM or 
SA segments. This includes, model year dependent data, 
software and hardware versions of the control modules 
installed, coding instructions, etc. 

The VN is displayed as 40 possible combinations of digits. A deliberate change in the 
VN will result in erroneous coding data being used when recoding a module or coding a 
replacement module which will affect the proper operation of a control module(s) coded 
with an incorrect VN. 

Note: In its original form the ZCS was displayed as a 48 digit code containing a 
fourth segment, the AM (Antriebsmanagement) which identified 
Powertrain management information specific to the vehicle, however this 
information was eliminated and was not needed for coding a control 
module.

(COUPE, SEDAN, ROADSTER, SUNROOF, ETC,) 

There are 4096 possible combinations of digits per model.

ZCS Stored Location in Vehicle 

The ZCS is stored in the vehicle to simplify the coding procedures when a module needs 
to be recoded or a replacement module needs to be coded. Depending on the vehicle, 
the ZCS information is stored in the following locations:

* The E46 switched to a Vehicle Order (VO) data structure in 9/01. 

The procedure to code control modules that utilize the ZCS information can be per¬ 
formed via the DISplus/GT 1 or SSS using Progman with CIP 15.0 or higher and access¬ 
ing the “Codierung ZCS/FA” function. Always reference service bulletins for information 
regarding the latest coding version and any possible software errors. 

When coding a ZCS codable control module the coding program in CIP automatically 
searches the stored location, based on the VIN, and codes the selected module accord¬ 
ing to the information provided in the ZCS code. 

On later production vehicles the ZCS information began to be stored in two locations, 
referred to as redundant data storages, this insures that the information is always available 
in the event the primary device storing the data fails. 

Note: On early production vehicles without redundant data storage, if the mod¬ 
ule being coded or recoded is the module that stores the ZCS informa¬ 
tion, then the vehicles ZCS information must be obtained from the label 
located on the vehicle or electronically accessed from the module and 
printed out then entered manually via the input screen on DISplus/GTI 
or SSS. 

For vehicles with redundant data storage the coding of the module stor¬ 
ing the data is performed automatically using the information stored in 
the “back up” module.

Accessing ZCS Information Label 

On earlier production vehicles the ZCS label is affixed to the 
vehicle in a specific location depending on the model: 

• E36 - Under rear seat; center area or next to left send¬ 
ing unit of fuel tank. 

• Z3 Roadster - In Trunk; under carpet on floor, forward 
of tool kit. 

• E31/32/34 - In fuse box cover 

• E38 - In E-Box cover 

Note: As of 9/98 production the ZCS label was eliminated from the vehicle. 
Some older vehicles will have identification labels containing an AM 
segment, this information is not needed for coding or recoding a control 
module on that vehicle.

Vehicle Order 

In 9/01 the ZCS vehicle data structure on the E46 was replaced with what is referred to 
as the Vehicle Order (VO) or Fahrzeugauftrag (FA). The vehicle order structure is utilized 
on all new models introduced/produced as of 9/01. such as E65/66, E60, E63/64, E83, 
E85 etc. Models such as E36, E39, E52, and E53 produced after 9/01 continued to be 
manufactured using the ZCS structure until production of the model is complete.

Vehicle Coding Information 









The vehicle order format contains information pertaining to the production of a specific 
vehicle such as: 

Series Type - (E46, E65, E60, etc.) 

Time Criterion - Identifies date the options/hardware equipment available for installation 
into the vehicle was standardized/”locked”. This information does not 
refer to the production date of the vehicle. A problem with coding or 
programming may occur if a module or option based on a newer or 
older time criterion date is installed into the vehicle. 

Model Code (Basic Type) - Base level from which the vehicle is “created/built”. 

Paint Code - Identifies the color of the vehicle at time of production. 

Upholstery Code - Identifies the type of upholstery installed in the vehicle at time of 

production. 

Assembly Number - Identifies the programmed part number for powertrain (Not used) 

E-Wort - Identifies additions/options added to the vehicle that are not part of standard 
SA codes/options 

HO-Wort - Identifies options installed at Center/Dealer using 3 digit option code 
(Currently not used. 

Installed Option/SA Codes - Listing of accessories & equipment options installed in 

the vehicle. 

The information contained in the vehicle order is used to identify the module(s)/system(s) 
that are/should be installed in the vehicle and also what if any control modules need to be 
updated if a new system/option is added or removed to/from the vehicle to ensure proper 
compatibility with the devices installed in the vehicle. The information contained in the 
vehicle order such as installed options, is modified whenever a new component (mod¬ 
ule/system) is installed and coded to the vehicle. If the new component is not properly 
coded to the vehicle the SA listing is not updated and problems can be encountered 
whenever a measures plan for the vehicle is created, vehicle needs to be recoded or 
VKM/Individualization functions are to be modified. 

A listing of the components that need to be updated is provided whenever a measures 
plan is generated (refer to CIP module for additional information).
