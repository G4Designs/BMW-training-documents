Progman Introduction 

With the release of CIP 15.0, BMW released a new software program known as Progman. 


rT ' 

Progman 




Progman 




Progman is a software package that operates with Windows XP Embedded to manage: 

• Administration & assignment of OPPS/OPS/Diagnostic heads plus network configu¬ 
ration/addressing. 

• Installation/loading of new data updates via Jetstream. 

• Activation of a Coding, Individualization or Programming request from a GT1 to an 
SSS via a multiconsole/multisession feature. 

• Coding, Individualization or Programming of older vehicles via the SGC/UNIX applica¬ 
tion. 

• Coding, Individualization & Programming functions of CIP

Progman 





































Progman 

The new prog ramming man agement tool utilizes a new operating system (Windows XP 
Embedded) to manage the programming processes that can be initiated via the SSS. 

Progman utilizes Windows XP Embedded which will serve as the basis for all further pro¬ 
grams required for programming applications. No changes can be made to the operating 
system of this Windows variant and it can be used only in connection with the corre¬ 
sponding hardware (Software Service Station). 



Progman incorporates all Coding, Individualization & Programming functions that were 
previously part of the DIS CD for E31/32/34/36/38/39/46/52 & E53, which operates under 
the old SGC/UNIX application, into the CIP application. 

Since CIP is incorporated into Progman, it will now contain all Coding, Individualization & 
Programming functions. CIP will be used to launch the SGC/UNIX application for the 
older vehicles as well as launch the Windows XP based application for Coding and 
Programming the newer vehicles. 

In the future the E36/38/39/46/52/53 applications will be converted/integrated directly 
into CIP and be based on Windows XP Embedded. The structure for the E31/32/34 will 
not be changed and will remain SGC/UNIX based. 

Administration 

The administration tool provides the same setting options as before however, Progman 
adds additional features/capabilities: 

• Ability to view and select accessible “Interfaces” (Diagnostic Head, OPPS, OPS...) 

• Configure interfaces 

• Adjust SSS and network specific settings 

• View available SSS units and select a specific unit 

• Select language specific to each SSS 


5 

Progman 























JETstream 


JETstream is the application that provides online data updates for Coding and 
Programming data. The feature allows the SSS to be up to date on the current/new 
vehicle data regarding coding and programming information prior to the release of an 
update DVD. The application can be configured to automatically search for online 
updates at a specific time (ex. after normal shop hours every night) and install any 
updates found at a specific time/point in the systems operation cycle. 

In order for this feature to work the SSS must: 

• Be located on the workshop network 

• Be connected to BMW via a network connection 

• Have the correct network specific data entered in the “Network” mask 

• Have the host/domain name and IP address of the BMW server entered in the 
“Online Service” mask 

• Have the “Automatic Online Update” feature active 

Multiconsole/Multisession 

Since the SSS is the primary Coding and Programming system, coding and programming 
tasks can be “transferred” to the SSS from any GT1 located on the workshop network. 

In order to monitor the tasks assigned to a specific SSS a menu of active jobs is dis¬ 
played via Progman and can be accessed by any GT 1 or SSS on the network. 


Multiconsole 

The multiconsole function makes it possible to control programming procedures both via 
the Software Service Station as well as via the BMW diagnosis systems GT 1. 

Multisession 

The multisession function makes it possible to program several vehicles simultaneously. 


This function allows the GT 1 to be remote terminals for the SSS with respect to Coding 
and Programming and once a task is transferred to an available SSS, the GT 1 can be 
used to diagnose another vehicle and/or transfer another coding/programming task to an 
SSS.

Progman 









CIP 


The Coding, Individualization and Programming application that has been used previously 
since the introduction of the E65 continues to operate the same as before. The only 
major change is that all of the Coding and Programming functions for the older vehicles 
(E31/32/34/36/38/39/46/52 & E53) that was only available on the DIS CD for use on 
DISplus and GT1 has been incorporated into CIP

What Will Progman Do For Me? 

Progman allows the GT1 to be released from the task of Programming and Coding vehi¬ 
cles. The GT1 will be capable of performing vehicle diagnosis while the SSS is used to 
Program and Code a vehicle(s). 

Example: Given a workshop with 10 active workstalls (CORA) and equipped with 2- 

GTI’s, 1-DISplus, 1-SSS, 3-Diagnostic Heads, 1 OPPS Head, 2-OPS Heads

By installing CIP 15.0 on all of the GTI’s and SSS’s, Progman can be accessed via any 
GT1 or SSS but is controlled/operated by the Software Service Station (SSS) only. Since 
the SSS controls/runs Progman, it will be the only device able to code and program vehi¬ 
cles, the GT1 will be viewed as a remote terminal for Progman. 

With the introduction of Progman, parallel programming of up to five vehicles can be per¬ 
formed. The vehicles to be programmed do not need to be the same model series nor 
have the same data status or be connected at the same time.

By selecting “Interfaces” an overview of all 
available and/or connected interfaces is 
obtained along with information pertaining to 
the status of the interface, device name, soft¬ 
ware level and IP address. 


Explanation of Status Indicators

Examples of Possible Combinations 

Symbol Description 



OPS with grey background and grey question mark: 

The OPS can not be detected as it is currently being started up or shut down or is 
not correctly configured/connected for the current network 
When devices are not connected, they are indicated as a grey question mark on a 
grey background without the interface symbol. 



OPPS with grey background and black question mark: 

A black question mark means that the OPPS is not configured for the current net¬ 
work. 



Diagnostic head with red background and black gearwheels: 

The diagnostic head is currently being used and is not available for a new session at 
this time. Only the configuration of the diagnostic head can be queried. 


Interface Name 

An interface name can be freely assigned to each interface so as to simplify definition of 
the interface in the workshop. The name used should be helpful in locating/identifying 
the particular interface if necessary. 

Example: Assign a name that uses the color band placed on the interface along with a 

letter of the alphabet (i.e. Blue A), place a label on the interface to identify the 
specific name that has been assigned and then modify a “service” hat by 
assigning the name of the interface to it as well, so that it can be placed on 
the vehicle to identify the interface being used on the vehicle. 


Version 

The firmware version indicates the software level currently installed on the selected inter¬ 
face (OPPS/OPS/ diagnostic head). It is recommended that the version on the interface 
be the same as that of the SSS it is being used with. 

IP Address 

The IP address (internet protocol address) is a unique and specifically assigned address 
for each device in the workshop network. This address consists of a number block which 
is normally structured as follows. 

Example: 192.168.100.10 

The IP addresses must be structured so that each device in the network is distinguished 
from all the others and must be exclusive to that device and not shared among other 
devices connected to the network. 

External Interface 

This column indicates whether the current interface is an external interface. External 
interfaces are located in external subnetworks and can be used in connection with this 
Software Service Station.

Configuration provides information for the 
device selected pertaining to: 


• Interface Name 

• Gateway 


• IP Address 

• IP Subnet Mask 



Interface Name 

The specific name assigned to the device (Ex. Blue A). The name used should be help¬ 
ful in locating/identifying the particular interface if necessary. 

IP Address 

A specific four segment number assigned exclusively to the device. The number repre¬ 
sents the address of the device on the network and is necessary when communicating 
with other devices located on the network. 

Example: 192.168.100.10 


12 

Progman 





















































































Gateway 

This information identifies the four segment address of the component located on the 
network responsible for communicating from the current network to another network. If 
the there is no address in this location then a connection to any devices outside of the 
current network can not be established. 

IP Subnet Mask 

This information is used to define which segment of the four segment IP address specifi¬ 
cally identifies the device and which identify the specific network. 

Example:255.255.255.0 

Indicates that the first three segments (255.255.255) identify the specific net¬ 
work that the device is located on. The last segment (0) indicates that this is 
the segment that will identify the specific device. 

Note: The network and device address information must be entered exactly as 
defined by the network administrator for your facility, otherwise the 
devices can not be accessed. 

After entering the necessary information and continue is selected, Progman will run a 
check on the values/information entered and will indicate if the information is acceptable.

Interface Update 

Interface update can only be selected if the selected interface is not being used by 
another device (interface symbol has a green background). 

This function allows the firmware of the inter¬ 
face to be checked against the version of the 
SSS. 

It is recommended that the version of the 
SSS and the Interface be at the same level 
to reduce susceptibility to errors and system 
conflicts. 

SSS;

FsiiiT.vjie adjuslment is necessary. 

Press Continue lo update your flmhuare. 




The SSS will check which firmware version is installed in the interface and then searches 
for the newest available version on the SSS. Depending on the result of the search, 
Progman will make a recommendation as to what action should be taken. 

• If both versions are equal no action is required. 

• If the version on the SSS is newer then Progman will suggest updating the version 
on the interface. 

• If the version on the SSS is older, Progman is able to change the version on the 
interface to the older one.

Updating Interface after Initial Install 

After the initial installation of Progman with CIP 15.0, the firmware installed on the inter¬ 
faces that will be used with Progman must first be updated. If the firmware level of the 
interface is not at a predefined level then it will not be recognized/identified within the 
Progman application, thereby not allowing a connection to the interface. This update 
only needs to be performed when an interface is used for the first time with Progman.

Self-Test 


Self-test can only be selected if the selected interface is not being used by another 
device (interface symbol has a green background). 

Depending on the interface selected a test loop must be attached to the interface. 

• For opps use test loop 663124 and 663131 

• For OPS use test loop 663124 

• For Diagnostic Head , no test loop is needed

An external interface is an interface that is 
not automatically detected by Progman or is 
not contained in the subnet of the workshop 
network, such an interface can be added 
manually to the list of available interfaces or 
removed using this function. In order to add 
an interface the I/P address of the interface 
must be entered. 


Example: The dealer has two separate service facilities each with its own network, an 

external interface can be connected to a vehicle located within one network 
and accessed by a GT1 or SSS located in the other network in order to 
Code/Program the vehicle.

FASTA 

The FASTA function assures that vehicle operation and service data from the diagnostic 
and programming devices are sent to BMW. With Progman if data is available it is trans¬ 
mitted automatically every five minutes

Send data 


ICTUS PV L i>..§4 1 i! ;, *1! 









This function shows if any data is available 
for transfer and when it will be sent. 

By selecting “Send data” (manual send) 
make sure that no sessions are currently 
running on the SSS as this will lengthen 
the data transmission process. 

It is preferred that the automatic transfer 
process be utilized. 


Note: In order for FAST data transmission to be possible the correct BMW 
server address must be entered in the “Online Service” menu. 

Date and Time 

In this function the current date and time must be entered. An automatic correction for 
daylight savings time to standard is made automatically. 

Operating Times 

The normal operating time of the workshop/service facility is entered in this function. The 
time is used to establish a maintenance period for the SSS. The end of normal operating 
time signals Progman to start executing/installing any online updates that may be avail¬ 
able. 

Dealer Data 

Information pertaining to country of operation, dealer number, dealer name, dealer 
address, contact person Telephone number and Email address are entered in this selec¬ 
tion. 

User Interface 

Under this menu language settings specific to the individual SSS and printer configura¬ 
tion information can be set. 

Example: If the language of the SSS is set to German then all information displayed on 

the SSS will be in German, however it does not mean that the GT1 will also 
display the text in German when accessing Progman and “connecting” to that 
SSS.
