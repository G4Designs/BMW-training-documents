Coding Plug 


Coding Plug 


A coding plug is a mechanically keyed or electronically coded device/plug, that can open 
or bridge circuits in a particular component to allow it to operate differently dependent on 
the type of plug installed/inserted. 

BMW used a mechanical coding plug which simply opened 
or bridged circuits to assign market specific data to the 
instrument cluster of the E23, E24, E28 and E30 vehicles. 

With the introduction of the E32 in 1988 and the E34 in 
1989, electronic coding plugs were utilized in the instrument 
cluster. 



The change to an electronic coding plug which allowed market specific data to be 
assigned to the instrument cluster also contained Non-Volatile Random Access Memory 
(NV-RAM), which provided an ability to retain vehicle specific data in the plug such as: 

• Vehicle Identification Number 

• Accumulated Mileage 

• Service Indicator Information 

• Coding plug number 

• Fuel Tank Size data 

• Etc, Etc. 

By using a plug that is able to store data, the 
instrument cluster can be replaced without 
loosing vehicle mileage, unless the coding 
plug is damaged.

With the introduction of vehicles like the E31 and E38 the instrument cluster no longer 
utilizes a coding plug since it receives most of its input signals directly from a control 
module, EKM (E31) or IKE (E38), this allows vehicle data to be directly stored in the con¬ 
trol module and the instrument cluster is no longer coded. For these vehicles and newer 
models, market specific data is stored in the control module (EKM or IKE). By coding 
these modules by way of ZCS coding (refer to ZCS coding) market specific data is 
assigned/released to the control module. 


Coding Plug Identification 

Each coding plug features a stored 5-digit numerical code 
that varies between model/equipment, etc. 

The code can be read out through the instrument cluster 
display by pressing the odometer reset button and turning 
the ignition switch to KL R. The coding plug number will be 
display in the instrument cluster matrix.

If this is no longer possible, the coding plug must be removed in order to read the code 
on the label of the coding plug. 

Ordering Replacement Coding Plug 

Replacement coding plugs for the redesigned E32/E34 cluster are clearly identified in 
Parts Bulletin 62 01 02. The coding plugs are received pre-coded and installing them 
automatically codes the cluster. 


The first digits of the 5-digit 
code is changed on coding 
plugs when they are replaced.

Note: It is not possible to input the mileage reading, the service interval status 
and the chassis number into the replacement coding plug. 

Coding Plug Overview 

Since the introduction of the E32 several versions of instrument cluster coding plugs 
have been introduced, this section will provide an overview of the different versions, plus 
provide identification and coding information. 

Coding Plug Identification - E32/E34 

The E32/E34 Instrument cluster coding plugs progressed through three variations of 
design. 

Start of production up to 2/89. 

The original E32/E34 instrument cluster coding plug 
was installed in the wiring harness connector (XI6) 
which plugged into the instrument cluster. This plug 
contained all of the vehicle specific coding data for the 
instrument cluster and retained accumulated mileage 
and service interval information. 

In the event that the instrument cluster must be 
replaced the coding plug is reused with the new clus¬ 
ter. By reusing the old/original plug the mileage in the 
odometer does not change, since the coding plug is 
able to retain the information. 

• If the coding plug must be replaced, the total 
mileage and Service Interval information will be 
lost. Refer to SI 62 02 88 (1597) for information 
regarding coding plug replacement.

Coding Plug 















• Replacement coding plugs pre-coded by part number and are available from the 
parts department. Only order replacement instrument cluster coding plugs as indi¬ 
cated in Parts Bulletin 62 01 02 . 

From 2/89 to 9/91 Production 

The E32/E34 instrument cluster and coding plug were redesigned in 2/89. As a result of 
this redesign the coding plug became an external component and plugged directly into 
the back of the instrument cluster, no longer part of the XI6 connector. 

Even though the plug can be removed without disconnecting the harness, all power must 
be disconnected from the cluster prior to removal, to prevent data loss from the coding 
plug. Reference SI 62 0691 (3284) regarding coding plug removal. 

9/90 Revision 

In 9/90 the cluster was slightly redesigned again to address changes in the fuel gauge 
and some minor physical changes. The electronics of the cluster as well as the coding 
plug were upgraded considerably. 

The coding plug and the instrument cluster are not compatible with the earlier redesign. 
The printed circuit board and the coding plug are colored blue for distinction over the 
components of the earlier redesigned cluster. 

The new blue coding plug is also keyed differently to prevent unintentional exchange with 
the earlier coding plug. Reference SI 62 01 91 (3210) for additional information. 

E32/34 as of 9/91 (1992 Model Year) 

After 9/91 production, the instrument cluster coding plug can be coded using the ZCS 
function within CIP by selecting the specific module via the DISplus/GTI/SSS . The 
physical characteristics of the coding plug did not change. 

A replacement uncoded coding plug (P/N 62 11 8 359 368) must be coded after installa¬ 
tion into the instrument cluster, refer to ZCS coding section in this manual. 

A precoded coding plug (P/N 62 11 8 359 369) is available for this cluster as well. When 
ordering include with your order the following information: 

• ZCS code for the vehicle 

• VIN for the vehicle 

E36 Instrument Cluster 
318i/is, 325i/is and M3. 

The instrument cluster for these vehicles does not utilize a coding plug. The entire clus¬ 
ter is coded model specific, by using the ZCS coding procedure in CIP by selecting E36. 

Recently, a new procedure has been made available that transfers the accumulated 
mileage and service interval data from a defective instrument cluster into a new replace¬ 
ment cluster for these vehicles.

This alternative procedure is not meant to replace the existing procedure utilizing the 
Federal Odometer Disclosure label. It is only meant for sensitive “dissatisfied customer” 
situations. Reference SI B62 02 95 for additional information. 

318ti and Z3 Roadster 

These vehicles are eguipped with an instrument cluster that is not connected to the diag¬ 
nostic link and therefore can not be coded using ZCS. Since the cluster can not be 
coded, these vehicles reguire a coding plug for vehicle specific coding. 

Like the E32/E34, the coding plug is able to store the accumulated mileage and service 
interval information. In addition to storing the data on the coding plug the instrument 
cluster is also able to internally store the data on an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable 
Programmable Read Only Memory), as redundant back. If the cluster main processor or 
coding plug need to be replaced, the mileage and SI Indicator data can be transferred to 
the new component using the clusters test step procedure #9. higher value overwrites 
the lower. 

Test No. 09 

DISTANCE READING Test - 09 allows the total stored mileage to be updated if one of 
the storage components has to be replaced. The test step will be used if the manipula¬ 
tion dot is illuminated in the cluster display. This test step will identify which component 
has the lower mileage. 

Display Example: 

0126541 - Indicates the mileage in the internal EEPROM is lower than the mileage 
stored in the coding plug. 

000325 E - Indicates the mileage in the external coding plug is lower than the total 
mileage stored in the internal EEPROM. 

Pressing the reset button for 4 seconds will over write the lower mileage with the higher 
mileage and cancel the manipulation dot. The SI data will also be transferred at the 
same time. 


To remove the coding plug from the instrument 
cluster first remove the snap off cover. Pull the 
coding plug from the connector in the cluster.

Federal Odometer Disclosure Requirement 92-513 

The Federal Odometer Disclosure Requirement 92-513 states that, whenever an instru¬ 
ment cluster component is replaced that brings the odometer back to 0 (coding plug), the 
mileage prior to its replacement along with the date that the replacement occurred must 
be recorded on the left doorframe of the vehicle. Reference SI B62 01 95 (4172) for 
additional information. 


A permanent label to record this information is included 
with every coding plug (except E36/5 and E36/7) that is 
ordered from the parts department. 

Additional labels can be ordered separately under Part 
Number 89 89 1 000 500.
