Variant Coding 


A Variant Code is another means by which market specific application data can be 
released/assigned to a control module, this process allows one base control module to be 
utilized for different market applications. 

The variant code is a 4 digit hexadecimal (alpha-numeric) code that is entered into a con¬ 
trol module as part of the coding process. By entering a valid code into the module a set 
of operational data (characteristic maps) specific to the code entered is assigned to the 
operating program of that control module. The operational data and code are semi rigidly 
assigned, meaning that if a new code is entered, a different set of data is assigned to the 
program. 

Variant coding is only used on engine control modules. Engine control modules which 
utilize variant coding were first introduced into production vehicles as of 3/87 production 
with Motronic M1.1 (Engine Control Module ECM/DME). Refer to TRIB120186 for 
more information. 


Variant coding is only used on Engine Control Modules with version Ml .X.

Using the DISplus/GTI/SSS with the latest CIP programming software contained within 
Progman, allows the technician to: 0ri 9' nal Replacement 

• Code a new, uncoded control module. 

• Recode a previously coded control module. 

The variant code is entered into the control 
module either by: 

• Adopting the existing code from the defec¬ 
tive DME control module (if diagnostic 
communication is possible). 

• Manually entering the variant code via the 
keypad displayed on the screen of the 
DISplus/GTI/SSS.

Note: Ml .X DME control modules can only be coded up to eight (8) times. The

Variant Coding 













































If variant coding of an Ml .3 control module for an M20 engine is not possible, Reference 
SI B12 06 89 (1878) for more information. The cause may be that Pin 18 (DME Code 
Link) of the 20 pin diagnostic connector may be backed out of the connector preventing 
communication between the tester and DME control module. 

Variant Code Identification Display 

The variant code for a DME Ml .X control module can be accessed in three ways: 

• Electronically via DISplus or GT1: 

- DME Control Module Identification screen 

- Select “Programming” then “DME variant code”, installed variant code is dis¬ 
played. 

• DME control module variant code label 

• SI B13 02 90 (3009) 

The quickest and most accurate way to access the variant code of the installed DME is 
by viewing the DME Identification page using the DISplus or GT1.

If a control module malfunction is suspected cross reference the BMW and Bosch part 
numbers in the display with the installed variant code. Problems can occur if: 

• The correct variant code is installed in the wrong control module. 

• An incorrect variant code is installed in the correct control module

Variant Code Structure 

The four digit structure of the variant code consists of a 16 bit binary code which con¬ 
verts to a 4 digit hexadecimal code. Each hex character provides information pertaining 
to specific functions, characteristic maps and vehicle data.

The information from the variant code is used to define the the operational data to be 
assigned to the operating program of the module. 


Each hex digit has a binary equivalent that provides four Is or Os which results in a total of 
16 bits of information (or choices) per hexadecimal digit. 


VARIANT CODE 



Under no circumstances should the variant code to be changed from the assigned num¬ 
ber for the vehicle. Erratic engine operation and possible engine damage may result.

Variant Code Procedure 


In the event that an Ml .x control module needs to be replaced or recoded the process 
can be accessed through Progman with CIP 15.0 or higher. 


To perform the procedure from CIP the Model 
series must be selected. 

Then select the body (E32, E36 ...) 



Select: “Progammierung” 

Advance screen to the right two times to enter 
the programming/variant coding selection screen. 


From the “Selection” screen: 

Select: "DME Variant Code" 

Select: "Exchange Control Unit" 

Select: The Engine version installed on the connected vehicle to be coded Ex. "M40/42/43"

"M40/42/43 4-Cyl. has been selected ? Y/N” 

Select: “Y” 

"Is the vehicle fitted with a DME Ml .7.3 (M43 engine from 9/95) ? Y/N” 

Select: “N” 

Select: 1 "New Coding" 

Select: 1 "Adopt code from old control unit" and follow the procedure indicated once selection is made. 
OR 

Select: 2 "Enter code manually" (See table for Variant Code) and follow the procedure indicated once 
selection is made.

Variant Coding 



































If DME Ml .X control module replacement is required, determine which method of variant 
coding you will need. 

• Adopt variant code from existing control module 

• Manual input of variant code from control module label 

Note: For vehicles produced with the M42B19 engine (Ml.7.2 Engine Control 
Module) a replacement EPROM was made available for vehicles produced 
1/94-12/95 to address a service issue,refer to SIB 12 09 95. Since the 
control module for this engine requires a variant code in order to assign 
the correct operating data to the program a variant code must still be 
assigned to the module upon installing the EPROM. 

Adopt a Variant Code 

The preferred method of coding a replacement module is by “Adopting” the code from 
the old module, since this method prevents accidentally entering the wrong code which 
may occur when trying to manually enter the code. If the control module cannot commu¬ 
nicate on the diagnostic link the manual input method will be necessary (refer to Manually 
Entering Variant Code). 


The variant code is To 

temporarily stored. Workshop

Manually Entering a Variant Code 

The process of manually entering a variant code should only be utilized when it is not 
possible to communicate with the Engine Control Module (DME) via the DISplus or GT1. 
The variant code to be entered can be taken from the label of the problem control mod¬ 
ule and checked against the listing of variant codes provided in SI B13 02 90 (3009) 
prior to entering the code into the new module.
