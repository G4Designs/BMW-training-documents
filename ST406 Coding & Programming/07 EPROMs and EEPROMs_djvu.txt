EPROMs & EEPROMs 


Introduction 

Early Engine and Transmission Control Modules used EPROMs (Electrically 
Programmable Read Only Memory device) to store operational programs and operating 
data specific for the application that they were used for. Since the operating program and 
associated data is installed at the factory during the vehicle assembly process updates 
could not be provided for vehicles once they were programmed and left the factory floor. 

In order to install a new or updated program (DME orTCM) the module needed to be 
replaced. Eventually it became possible to replace EPROMs and/or update them which 
dramatically reduced the cost of updating a module and a vehicle. 

Engine Control Module EPROM Programming 

With the introduction of M3.X & DME/ECM control modules it was no longer necessary 
to replace the entire control module in order to install updated engine operating programs 
and/or data.

• To be removed & replaced 

• Programmed or updated depending on control module version 

M3.1 Engine Control Modules 

Beginning with M3.1 DME/ECM control modules, BMW introduced the ability to program 
an EPROM using BMW diagnostic equipment. On the M3.1 control module the original¬ 
ly installed EPROM needs to be removed from the control module and a new partially 
blank EPROM installed in order to update the existing control module.

EPROMs & EEPROMs 




For the M3.1 systems the replacement EPROM that is installed does not contain all the 
data necessary for the engine to operate, it is a “basic” EPROM that only contains some 
basic data referred to as “resident data” which helps identify the module and allows the 
diagnostic eguipment to determine what program and associated data needs to be 
installed/loaded. 

For specific information refer to EPROM replacement SI B12 08 95(4274). 


M3.3 & M3.3.1 Engine Control Modules 

As later versions of engine control modules (M3.3 & M3.3.1) were introduced it was not 
always necessary to replace the EPROM in order to perform an update to the module. 
The EPROMs installed on the newer systems are larger and allow additional information 
to be loaded without having to install a new EPROM. In the event that the size of the 
update exceeds the space available on the installed EPROM or an update was previously 
performed, then the installed EPROM will need to be replaced. For specific information 
refer to EPROM replacement SIB 12 08 95(4274) 


For the M3.3 & M3.3.1 systems the replacement EPROM that is installed does not con¬ 
tain all the data necessary for the engine to operate, it is a “basic” EPROM that only con¬ 
tains some basic data referred to as “resident data” which helps identify the module and 
allows the diagnostic eguipment to determine what program and associated data needs 
to be installed/loaded.

Engine Control Modules Flash (EEPROM) Programming 

At the end of 1995 new variations of DME/ECM control modules were introduced that no 
longer contained a removable EPROM but instead contained a soldered in EEPROM. An 
EEPROM is an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory device, which 
means that programs & data stored on the chip can be electrically erased and replaced 
with new/revised programs or data. In order to erase the data on the chip a short duration 
low level voltage/charge is applied to a pin on the EEPROM and the stored data is erased, 
hence the name “Flash”. Once the data is erased new data is loaded. 

By using a newer technology, these control modules have the ability to be updated a total 
of 13 times before they need to be replaced. 

Theoretically an EEPROM can be erased and reprogrammed more than 13 times, BMW 
set the number to 13, since a point will be reached where the update being installed may 
no longer be compatible with the hardware of the installed module which could result in 
erroneous operation. If the program is not compatible with the hardware version of the 
module, the program used to determine the correct update for the module will indicate 
that the module will need to be replaced before the update can be performed. 

The reference to Flash programming is a result of the technology used to erase the 
EEPROM prior to installing a new program and or data. 

The control modules listed identify when EEPROMs were first introduced into the 
DME/ECM:

Transmission EPROMS 


Beginning with vehicles produced in the early 1990’s the Transmission EPROM can be 
replaced on some vehicles in order to address customer complaints that would normally 
be addressed by having to replace the Transmission Control Module (TCM). Service

Transmission Control Module Flash (EEPROM) Programming 

The introduction of newer generation Transmission Control Modules introduced with the 
M44, M52 and M62 engines at the end of 1995, brought with it the ability to “flash”pro- 
gram this module as well. By being able to electrically erase and install a new program 
and or data stored on the EEPROM, it no longer becomes necessary to replace the chip 
to get an updated transmission program installed. 

The technology used on the Transmission Control module is the same as explained in the 
section “Engine Control Module Flash (EEPROM) Programming”.

EPROMs & EEPROMs 




When is EPROM Replacement and/or Programming Necessary? 

The program and or data of an engine or transmission control module only needs to be 
updated or replaced if: 

• The control module is replaced with a non programmed/basic module. 

• A Service Action, Recall or customer concerns have resulted in the release of a 
new/updated program or revised operational data. 

The programming procedure of the diagnostic equipment will identify if: 

• a DME EPROM needs to be replaced or can be updated 

• a control module (DME or Transmission) can still be programmed or needs to be 
replaced if the reprogramming limit of 13 times has been reached 

How is a Replacement EPROM or Control Module Determined? 

DME/ECM EPROM 

As mentioned previously on the M3.1 Engine Control Modules the EPROM needs to be 
replaced whenever an update is to be performed. On M3.3 and M3.3.1 Control Modules 
the EPROM’s for these modules generally have enough additional space to add/load one 
update. However, if the update that needs to be installed is too large, then the installed 
EPROM needs to removed and a Basic EPROM reinstalled. The diagnostic equipment 
(DISolus. GT1 or SSS) contains a program within CIP that will determine the part number 
of the replacement EPROM or control module that needs to be installed. 

For some control module variations there is more than one replacement EPROM avail¬ 
able. 

Example: An M3.1 DME has three different hardware versions: 

Bosch Hardware Number 0 261 200 402 
Bosch Hardware Number 0 261 200 403 
Bosch Hardware Number 0 261 200 405 

This requires three different replacement EPROM’s, however one EPROM is not neces¬ 
sarily specific to one hardware version. 

TCM 

Regarding the replacement EPROM for Transmission Control Modules there are specific 
Service Bulletins which identify various situations that can be addressed by replacing the 
EPROM in the control module. The replacement transmission EPROM does not require 
any type of programming after being installed, as it already contains all the program and 
operational data. 

If an early version Transmission Control Module, for vehicles prior to 1996 model year, is 
replaced it generally also does not need to have the EPROM replaced as the required 
program is already installed.

Programming Procedure 

Within CIP is a procedure that requires the selection of the model/series whenever a/an: 

• EPROM needs to be updated/replaced 

• EEPROM needs to be updated 

• Control module needs to be replaced 

Then select “Programming” - “DME Programming” or “EGS Programming” and follow 
the steps given in the respective SIB.

Determination Process for DME EPROM 

In the event a DME EPROM, a control module or the program of a control module needs 
to be updated or replaced the program contained within CIP will provide the information 
necessary to perform the specific task. A program within CIP is used to determine the 
correct replacement part numbers (EPROM, Control Module or software update) to be 
installed. 

For earlier production vehicles there are two ways to perform this process: 

• “automatic” determination 

or 

• “manual” determination. 

The automatic determination is the preferred method as it is faster and mistakes made 
during data entry into the tester are avoided. For newer production vehicles that utilize 
EEPROMs/Flash programming the determination process is done automatically as part of 
determining a measures plan (refer to CIP section or more information).

EPROMs & EEPROMs 




Automatic Determination 

In order to determine which EPROM needs to be installed there is a special procedure 
that is executed as part of the “Exchange EPROM” process. The procedure will “auto¬ 
matically” determine the correct replacement EPROM or control module part number, 
based on the “Basic part number” and “Programmed part number” stored on the 
installed EPROM, if the EPROM is not damaged. 

The procedure is run automatically if “YES” is selected for the answer to the question “Is 
old EPROM still installed. 

During the automatic determination process the tester compares the part numbers 
stored in the EPROM of the currently installed DME control module with a list of possible 
replacement part numbers contained in the program of the tester. 

The comparison is done to determine if the tester can "recommend" a replacement 
EPROM or control module part number. 

Manual Determination 

If the EPROM is damaged then the “Basic part number” and “Programmed part number” 
indicated on the label of the control module that is located on the cover of the module 
must be entered “manually” via the touch screen on the tester so that the replacement 
part numbers can be determined. 

This procedure is followed if “NO” is selected for the answer to the question “Is old 
EPROM still installed?” 

During a manual determination you will need to: 

• Enter the part number for a basic (programmable) control module. 

• Enter the VIN number of the vehicle. 

• Enter the part number of a programmed control module 

Once the correct numbers are entered, the tester searches a “master list” for the proper 
replacement part number and will display either that part number or the message "no 
substitute found." 

Regardless of which process is used if the replacement part does not match the part 
number displayed and "expected" by the program on the tester, programming will not 
occur. You need to obtain the proper replacement part. 

At no time during the determination or programming process should you turn off the igni¬ 
tion, disconnect the control module or tester/interface. 

Once the EPROM is programmed by way of the “Automatic” or “Manual” determination 
process it contains the operating program for the engine and the associated operational 
data or characteristic maps. In the event a basic replacement control module is installed, 
the EPROM installed in the control module will be programmed in the same manner. 

Note: The EPROM in a basic replacement module does not need to be replaced 
since it only contains the “resident data” and nothing else.
