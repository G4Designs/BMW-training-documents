Coding, Individualization & Programming 

Introduction 

With the introduction of the E65 in 2001, BMW not only introduced a vehicle loaded with 
the latest technology but also introduced a new way of performing vehicle coding and 
programming. In order to code and program an E65, a software program commonly 
referred to as CIP was introduced. The acronym CIP stands for Coding, Individualization 
& Programming and with the introduction of Progman & CIP 15.0 it has become the sole 
software tool for coding and programming vehicles. 

Initially CIP was developed for use on the E65/E66 and newer models but has since been 
expanded to include all vehicles produced prior to the introduction of the E65 that utilize a 
an SGC/UNIX programming structure. 

The intention of the CIP program is to insure that whenever a module is updated or 
replaced it will still be compatible with all the other modules installed in the vehicle 
(equipped with a MOST bus). Since all of the communication between the various mod¬ 
ules installed in a vehicle is over a bus network structure, it is very important that all of the 
installed modules be able to communicate with each other without problems. 

To ensure compatibility/seamless integration between control modules, the CIP software 
reads out the part numbers of all the control modules installed in the vehicle as well as 
the software levels of the respective modules. The information from the various installed 
modules is then cross referenced against a “master reference list” to determine if a mod¬ 
ule^) needs to be updated and how this update will effect the other installed modules. 
Once this cross reference process is started it can result in additional issues such as: 

• If the software level in a selected module is updated will the hardware of the module 
still be able to function correctly. 

• If the software to be installed is not going to be compatible with the installed hard¬ 
ware then the module will need to be replaced. 

• If updated software is installed in the selected module will this have any impact on 
any other installed modules and will they need to have the software updated or will 
the hardware need to be updated in additional modules in order to install the revised 
software. 

Example: A desktop computer originally built with a Pentium I, 75 Mhz processor using 

Windows 95 is not able to operate using Windows 2000. In order to operate 
with Windows 2000 this old desktop computer needs to upgraded with new 
hardware. However, a desktop computer designed to operate with Windows 
2000 can be updated to Windows XP without having to upgrade the hard¬ 
ware of the computer. 


3 

Coding, Individualization & Programming (CIP) 



All hardware devices that utilize software/prog rams to operate can only have the installed 
software updated a certain number of times before the operating capacity of the installed 
hardware is exceeded and no longer compatible, this results in the device no longer being 
able to function. In order for these devices to continue to operate the installed 
hardware/control modules will need to be updated, which is what happens in our vehicles 
or desktop computers overtime. 

Specific information pertaining to coding and programming with CIP are provided in 

SIB 09 05 01. 

Integration Levels 

All new models produced as of the E65 have a minimum allowable software level, based 
on production date, which is referred to as an integration level or data status. The inte¬ 
gration level defines the software level that all the control modules installed into a particu¬ 
lar model, at time of production, must be at in order to ensure compatibility. Once an 
integration level for a specific production period is defined/“locked”, the modules installed 
in those vehicles can not be updated beyond that level. 

The Integration level or data status for vehicles equipped with a most bus is provided in 
the “Status report” or “Measures plan” as shown below. 

Vehicle data status: E060-04-09-503 

Target data status: E060-04-09-555 

If the vehicle data status and target data status are not the same, this indicates that some 
of the installed control modules need to be updated to bring the vehicle up to the latest 
level. 

If the software levels were not locked it would be quite complex to track all software and 
hardware variations for all models through all production ranges. It would be extremely 
difficult to determine what software and hardware level is compatible with each module 
installed in a specific vehicle(s) and exactly what needs to be updated if one module is 
updated or replaced, therefore a limit or locked point must be define for specific produc¬ 
tion periods by model. 

Example: MY2002 vehicles can not be programmed with software that is assigned to 

MY2003 vehicles since the defined integration level for each Model Year is 
different. Similarly Windows 2000 can not be installed & operated on a com¬ 
puter originally developed to run with Windows 95. 

Information contained in this module is for reference as a user guide, more detailed infor¬ 
mation can be obtained from the respective Service Information Bulletins 

SI B09 05 01 & SI B09 03 98.

Coding, Individualization & Programming (CIP) 



Measures Plan 

A measures plan is generated by CIP to identify what if any control modules need to be 
updated in order to bring a vehicle up to the latest integration level or data status. The 
measures plan also identifies the part number of the old/installed programmed control 
module and also what the new part number will be after the update is performed.

CIP Functions - If No (MOST-Bus Vehicles) 



After selecting “No” CIP evaluates the 
installed control modules to determine if any 
updates are required. 



Once the evaluation is completed and CIP 
determines that there are updates available a 
“Status report” is generated. 

Note: Status report is similar to a mea¬ 
sures plan. 

The status report identifies the control mod¬ 
ules for which an update is available and also 
indicates if the module will need to be repro¬ 
grammed or replaced. 

Information is also provided indicating the 
current programmed part number and also 
what the number should be after an update 
is performed.

The CKM feature contained in CIP (for models produced as of the E65) provides the abil¬ 
ity to “customize” certain vehicle and key functions to meet the specific preferences of 
the customer. It is important to note that the functions/features that can be “customized” 
will vary depending on model, equipment level and vehicle software level. 


Upon selecting “CKM” a check of the current vehicle and key settings is made and dis¬ 
played. The displayed settings list should be printed out and provided to the customer in 
order for them to select how the available functions should be set . The CKM function 
contained within CIP allows settings for both vehicle and keys to be made directly, the 
older version separates the key settings from the vehicle setting as different functions.

ZCS Coding Procedure 

The ZCS coding procedure can currently be performed with the DISplus using DIS CDs 
until DIS CD 42 is released at which time all SGC/Unix coding and programming func¬ 
tions will be available only via Progman using the GT1 orSSS. 

There are two methods of encoding replacement control modules: 

• Manual input of ZCS 

• Automatic ZCS retrieval and coding 

Coding Control Modules that Store the ZCS 

On earlier production vehicles when replacing a control module that stores the ZCS code 
(i.e Kombi?lnstrument Cluster) the information must be entered manually in order to code 
the replacement module. The ZCS code from the label located in the vehicle or a print¬ 
out of the code stored in the module to be replaced must be entered into the new mod¬ 
ule. 

The control modules that store the ZCS and require manual input are: 

• IKE-E38 

• EKM-E31 

• Instrument Cluster - E32/34 (After 9-91) & E36 (except 318ti and Z3 Roadster) 

• EWS II - 318ti &Z3 Roadster 

Note: As long as the defective EWS II control module can communicate with 
the coding equipment, automatic encoding is possible. 

On later production vehicles where the ZCS information is stored in two modules, redun¬ 
dant data storage, the ZCS information to code the replacement module can be obtained 
from the second/backup module. 

Vehicles which have redundant ZCS data storage are: 

• E36 (Z3) - Instrument Cluster & EWS II as of 9/98 

• E39 - Instrument Cluster & EWS II 

• E46 - Instrument Cluster & LSZ 

• E53 - Instrument Cluster & LSZ 

Note: E46 changed from ZCS to a Vehicle Order (VO/FA) vehicle data structure 
in 9/01.

Retrofit 

The retrofit function allows options or accessory equipment to be added after the vehicle 
is manufactured. 

By selecting to install a new option/accessory from the list of available retrofits for the spe¬ 
cific vehicle, the ZCS information will be updated to reflect the addition of the new option 
or accessory that was installed. Updating of the ZCS information will ensure that the new 
component is recognized and able to communicate with the other modules in the vehicle. 

Conversion 

The conversion function allows specific features of certain control modules/systems to be 
modified, similar to the way lndividualization(Vehicle & Key Memory) is used on newer 
models to “customize” a vehicle.
