Introduction 


The purpose of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system 
(HVAC) is to treat the air entering the passenger compartment in 
order to achieve and maintain a constantly comfortable environ¬ 
ment for the occupants. 

The modern automotive system that adds/removes heat, dehu- 
midifies, ventilates and filters the air entering the passenger com¬ 
partment is referred to as Climate Control. Climate Control 
describes a more complete and precise management of the basic 
HVAC system, where the climate of the vehicles is constantly var¬ 
ied and adjusted depending on the occupants desired and 
reguested settings. 

The Climate Control System must: 

• Adjust the temperature of the passenger compartment, 
depending on the reguirements of the driver / passenger and 
dictated by outside temperatures. 

• Circulate air through out the vehicle. 

• Remove moisture, assist in defogging of the 
windows and enhancing occupant comfort level. 

• Filter the air to remove dust, allergens. 

Climate Control can be divided into the following Sub-Systems: 

• Heater 

• Air Conditioning 

• Air Management (blower, filters, vents) 

• Computer Controls (inputs and outputs) 


Heating System 

The “heater” or heating system of a vehicle is typically dependent 
on the vehicles engine cooling system. To analyze one we must 
first discuss the other. 

The engine cooling system is essentially responsible for the 
extraction and dissipation of the excess heat that results from the 
internal combustion process and friction forces associated with the 
normal operation of an engine. 

Once the operating temperature has been reached the system 
dedicates most of its resources into controlling and maintaining 
this operation temperature. At the same time the surplus heat is 
diverted to the heater core inside of the vehicle where a blower 
motor fan is used to circulate heat through the passenger com¬ 
partment. 

Basic Heating System Components 

• Coolant 

• Radiator 

• Radiator cooling fan 

• Water pump (electric or mechanical) 

• Thermostat (conventional or Data-Map) 

• Coolant pipes and hoses 

• Auxiliary water pump (optional) 

• Coolant/water valve (optional)

Heat Management 

The engine management DME (ECM) controls the coolant flow 
depending on the following conditions: 

• Low output when cooling reguirement is minimum and outside 
temperatures are low. 

• High output when maximum cooling is required and outside 
temperatures are high. 

The electric coolant pump may be completely switched off under 
certain conditions (to allow the coolant to heat up rapidly during the 
warm-up phase). However, this only occurs when no heating is 
required and the outside temperature is within the allowed range. 

The electric pump also operates differently from conventional 
pumps when controlling the engine temperature. Previously, only 
the currently present temperature could be controlled by the ther¬ 
mostat. The software in the engine control module now features a 
calculation model that can take into account the progression of the 
cylinder head temperature based on load. In addition to data-map 
control of the thermostat, the heat management system makes it 
possible to use various data maps for the purpose of controlling the 
coolant pump. For instance, the DME can adapt the engine tem¬ 
perature to match the current driving situation. 

This means that four different temperature ranges can be imple¬ 
mented: 

• 111 0 C(232°F) ECO mode 

• 105°C (221 °F) Normal mode 

• 95°C (203°F) High mode 

• 80°C (176°F) High + data-map thermostat mode 


If the engine management DME (ECM) selects ECO mode based 
on the current operating conditions, the system aims to bring about 
a higher cylinder head temperature of 111 °C. 

The engine is operated with relatively low fuel consumption in this 
temperature range as internal friction is reduced. An increase in 
temperature therefore favors lower fuel consumption in the low 
load range. In High and Data-map thermostat mode, the driver 
wishes to utilize the optimum power development of the engine. 
The cylinder head temperature is therefore reduced to 80°C. This 
results in improved volumetric efficiency, thus increasing engine 
torque. The DME (ECM) can then set an operating mode adapted 
to the particular driving situation. Consequently, it is possible to 
influence fuel consumption and power output by means of the 
cooling system.

Intelligent Heat Management 

The previous section explained the operating modes in which heat 
management was implemented. However, an electrically driven 
coolant pump makes even more options possible. For instance, it is 
now possible to warm up the engine without the coolant circulat¬ 
ing, or to allow the pump to continue running after the engine is 
switched off in order to facilitate heat dissipation. 

The advantages offered by this type of pump are listed below: 

Fuel Consumption 

• Faster warm-up as coolant is not circulated (stationary) 

• Increased compression ratio through greater cooling capacity 
at full load compared to the predecessor engine 


Exhaust Emissions 

• Faster engine warm-up due to drastically reduced pump 
speed and the resulting minimal volumetric flow of coolant 

• Reduced friction 

• Reduced fuel consumption 

• Reduced exhaust emissions 


Comfort 

• Optimum coolant volumetric flow. 

- Greater heater output when demanded. 

- Residual heat when engine is not running. 


Component Protection 

• Electric pump overrun achieves more effective heat dissipa¬ 
tion after switching off engine when hot coolant at the rate 
determined by the engine speed. 

• Only the circulated amount of coolant can be influenced by 
the mapped thermostat for temperature control purposes. 

• The system switches between the small and large circuit, i.e. 
the circuit flowing via the radiator. This consequently means 
that the cooling capacity is dependent on the engine speed. 

• If the heater core temperature exceeds safety parameters, the 
IHKA module will manipulate the thermostat settings to lower 
the overall heat in the system to protect the core from burst¬ 
ing. 


Power Output 

• Component cooling independent of engine speed 

• Demand-based coolant pump output 

• Avoidance of energy loss 



Air Conditioning System 


An air conditioning system does not produce cold air but rather it 
carries heat away from the vehicle interior to the outside. The 
closed system is filled with a refrigerant (R12 or R134a) which is 
circulated and provoked to change state from a liguid to a gas and 
back again. 


Basic A/C System Components 

• Refrigerant 

• Condenser 

• Condenser fan 


The air conditioning system operates in accordance with the refrig¬ 
erating principle. Circulating through this closed system, the refrig¬ 
erant is compressed, heated, expanded and cooled as it extracts 
heat and humidity from the air of the passenger compartment.

The Refrigerant Cycle 

The refrigerant circuit is divided into a high pressure section (high 
side) and a low pressure section (low side). The high pressure side 
is comprised of the compressor, condenser, condenser fan, pres¬ 
sure sensor, receiver dryer and expansion valve. The low pressure 
side also involves the compressor and expansion valve along with 
the evaporator and blower fan.The expansion valve separates the 
high-pressure side of the system from the low-pressure side. 
Pressurized liquid refrigerant exits the receiver dryer and as it pass¬ 
es through the metered orifice of the expansion valve it decom¬ 
presses and boils. 



This change of state causes the refrigerant to absorb heat as it 
makes its way through the inside the evaporator. The amount of 
refrigerant released is controlled by the expansion valve based on 
evaporator temperature and pressure as well as the temperature of 
the air passing through the evaporator and proportional to the cool¬ 
ing demand. If too little refrigerant enters the evaporator, poor cool¬ 
ing results. If too much refrigerant enters, it might not completely 
boil away and liquid refrigerant might return to the compressor, 
causing damage to the system.

The pressure and temperature are measured by passing the refrig¬ 
erant through the expansion valve at the outlet of the evaporator. 
The top section of the valve measures the temperature of the 
refrigerant intake and the refrigerant pressure acts on the 
underside of the diaphragm. 

The valve needle is pressed down against a spring to open the 
valve, allowing liguid refrigerant to flow into the evaporator. The 
refrigerant evaporates, pressure and temperature drop. 

The pressure and temperature of the gaseous refrigerant at the 
evaporator outlet are used to open and close the valve via a 
diaphragm. 

When the air temperature at the evaporator outlet drops, the sens¬ 
ing gas in the diaphragm chamber contracts, this moves the valve 
needle upward and reduces the refrigerant flow rate to the evapora¬ 
tor. 

The flow rate is increased again when the air temperature at the 
evaporator output rises. Increasing pressure at the evaporator outlet 
assists the valve closing action. Decreasing pressure assists the 
valve opening action. This control procedure runs continuously for 
as long as the air conditioning system is in operation. 



Heat is extracted from the cabin air as it is circulated by the blower 
fan through the evaporator outer surface area. This transfers heat 
from the cabin air to the vaporizing refrigerant inside, reiterating that 
an air conditioning system operates by removing heat instead of 
adding cold. 

An engine driven compressor extracts the, gaseous, low pressure 
refrigerant from the evaporator, compresses it and heats it. The 
now compressed and superheated gas is pumped through the 
condenser where it cools to a medium temperature, high pressure 
liguid as out side air is forced through the condenser fins via driving 
or the condenser cooling fan. 



The refrigerant now in a subcooled liguid state flows from the con¬ 
denser to a liguid reservoir (receiver dryer) where it is collected. Any 
moisture and impurities are removed by the desiccant in the receiv¬ 
er dryer. This high pressure liguid now flows back into the low pres¬ 
sure side of the system, where it is forced through the expansion 
valve metered orifice back into the evaporator on its way to com¬ 
plete the cycle once again.

A/C System Diagnosis 


Refrigerant Pressure 

Refrigerant pressure is directly proportional to its temperature so 
as the temperature goes up so does the pressure and vice versa. 

Refrigerant in the A/C system is provoked to change state from a 
liquid to a gas and back again. During every change of state heat 
is either absorbed or given away in the process. This thermody¬ 
namic property is put to use in the Low Side and in the High Side 
of all A/C systems. 

The low side pressure is a direct reading the evaporator tempera¬ 
ture and its heat exchanging capabilities. Low side pressures 
should average +/- 2bar. (28 to 32psi) that means that actual pres¬ 
sure of a variable displacement compressor/TEV system can be 
between 1 to 3bar. or (15 to 45psi) at any given time. 

The high side pressure is a direct reading of the condenser cool¬ 
ing efficiency. Although high side pressures may vary between 
150 to 300psi. normally they should be about 2 to 2.5 times the 
ambient temperature. Depending on humidity, an outside temper¬ 
ature of 80°F should produce a pressure of 160 to 200psi on the 
High Side. 

When the high side pressure is way above normal it may indicate 
that the condenser auxiliary cooling fan is not cooling the refriger¬ 
ant sufficiently. Proper airflow across the condenser insures the 
efficiency of the entire system. The cooler the refrigerant leaving 
the condenser the lower its pressure; consequently the lower the 
temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator the more 
heat can be absorbed from the passenger compartment. 

Pressure gauges are indispensable when diagnosing an A/C sys¬ 
tem BUT they are incapable of measuring the quantity or for that 
matter the type of refrigerant in the system. 


The refrigerant capacity of an A/C system can be found on the 
A/C label under the hood and in the respective technical informa¬ 
tion relating the specific system.

Service Information 

Condenser Service 

The procedure in the condenser is divided into three operations. 

In the first stage, the hot gaseous refrigerant at a temperature of 
about 60-120°C coming from the compressor at a pressure of 10 
to 25 bar gives off its superheat to the outside air. The actual con¬ 
densation takes place in the second phase where the refrigerant 
has lost so much energy that it becomes liguid. In the third phase, 
further energy is taken from the now liguid refrigerant. This state is 
referred to as refrigerant sub-cooling. This phase also makes sure 
that no gas bubbles can form on the refrigerant’s way to the expan¬ 
sion valve. The sub-cooling takes more heat away from the refriger¬ 
ant than is necessary for actual condensation. The sub-cooled 
refrigerant in the evaporator can absorb a larger guantity of heat 
and thus increase the refrigerating capacity of the system. The aux¬ 
iliary fan arranged directly before the condenser ensures an effec¬ 
tive supply of cooling air. The refrigerant remains in the condenser 
at a high pressure of approx. 10-25 bar. Approx. 80-90% of the 
condenser is used in the actual condensation process where a 
temperature drop of 30 to 40°C occurs. 

The following points must be observed when working on the 
condenser: 

• The distance between the condenser and vehicle radiator 
must be as large as possible. 

• The condenser fins must not be bent or dirty. 

• Ensure the auxiliary fan is operating correctly. 

• A soiled condenser results in poor condensation and 
unnecessarily high operating pressures. 

Note: The sub-cooling of the refrigerant in the condenser 
enhances the efficiency of the air conditioning sys¬ 
tem. 


Evaporator Service 

The evaporator functions as a heat exchanger in that thermal ener¬ 
gy is taken externally from the air and given off internally to the 
refrigerant. The most important factor is the energy absorption by 
the refrigerant during the transition from the liguid to the gaseous 
state.This transition reguires a great deal of energy in the form of 
heat which is taken from the air blown through the system of fins. 
The refrigerant cools down greatly while the injection procedure 
ensures the pressure drops from 10-20 bar. to about 2 bar. The 
refrigerant is evaporated at low pressure by the heat delivered from 
the passenger compartment with the use of a blower fan. 

The following points must be observed when working on the 
evaporator: 

• The evaporator fins must not be dirty or bent. This would 
result in the growth of bacteria and odor. 

• The evaporator fins must not ice up. If the evaporator does ice 
up, the fault will be in the area of the evaporator temperature 
sensor. This situation may result in compressor damage. 

• The micro filter change intervals must be maintained to insure 
adeguate airflow. 

• The condensation water drain must not be clogged and water 
must drain off freely. 

• The evaporator temperature sensor must be installed correctly. 

Note: To treat bacteria and odor complaints, a special 

cleaning and treatment procedures must be followed. 
SI 64 04 03 “A/C System Musty Odor” can be found 
in TIS. 



Expansion Valve Service 

A block-valve design of expansion valve is used on current BMW 
A/C systems. The refrigerant enters at the upper right inlet. At the 
left of the valve there is a capillary tube filled with an inert gas that 
senses the temperature of the air coming into the housing from the 
plenum. 



When the air temperature in the plenum rises, the pressure in the 
capillary tube increases. This pushes down on a diaphragm and 
pushrod assembly, which increases the size of the orifice opening, 
allowing more refrigerant into the evaporator and providing more 
cooling. 

When plenum temperature falls, the pressure in the capillary tube 
falls. The spring pushes up on the pushrod, making the orifice 
opening smaller; less refrigerant is allowed into the evaporator, 
allowing less cooling. Refrigerant from the outlet of the evaporator 
passes through the bottom left opening of the block valve. 


When the pressure at the evaporator outlet is high, this increases 
the pressure needed by the capillary tube to open the valve. Less 
refrigerant is provided to the evaporator (to prevent the evaporator 
from being flooded). 

When pressure at the outlet end of the evaporator is lower, less 
pressure is exerted on the bottom of the diaphragm. The 
diaphragm pushes down on the pushrod, allowing more refrigerant 
into the evaporator. 

The following points must be observed when working on the 
expansion valve: 

• Very little refrigerant flow through the evaporator will result in 
poor AC output. 

• Too much refrigerant flow will flood the evaporator and cause 
possible compressor damage. 

• The setting of the expansion valve must not be adjusted or 
varied (except for instructions in the Service Information). 

• The expansion valve must not be repaired. 

• Seals must be replaced every time the pipes and hoses are 
released. 

• It is imperative that an A/C system being serviced be evacuat¬ 
ed for a minimum of 30 minutes or more in order to remove 
any possible moisture trapped within. 

Note: If moisture gets into this system, it may freeze and 
clog the expansion valve. The A/C system may oper¬ 
ate normally for a while, then stop cooling. Then, as 
system temperature increases, the ice melts. The 
system works again for a while, until moisture freeze- 
up causes it to stop again.

Compressor Service 

The function of the compressor is to pump the refrigerant along the 
system. As the gaseous refrigerant exits the evaporator, it is pulled 
into the compressor by suction where it is compressed and super¬ 
heater and then pumped along to the condenser. Liquid refrigerant 
in the compressor causes noise complaints and internal damage. 
There are currently three methods of compressor control and two 
types of compressors depending on the vehicle or equipment 
option. (See Compressor Operation) 

Typical Compressor service points to remember: 

• When troubleshooting a noisy compressor complaint, make 
sure the noise is present only when the clutch is engaged. 

• If it is present when the clutch is not engaged, remove the 
compressor drive belt and check again. 

• If the noise continues, it is not related to the compressor. 

• If removing the drive belt reduces or eliminates the noise, 
check the torque of the compressor and bracket mounting 
bolts. 

• Check the belt tension and condition, and tensioner pullies 
which can produce rattling noises that would sound like a 
defective compressor. 

• A loose/slipping belt can cause noise. 

• A belt that is too tight can damage the clutch/pulley bearings. 

• If the compressor is noisy with the compressor clutch 
engaged, make sure the system is charged with the correct 
amount of refrigerant. 

• An over-charged system can cause compressor noise. 

• If the A/C system is overcharged with refrigerant, the liquid 
entering the compressor can damage it. 


• When troubleshooting a noisy compressor complaint, recover 
the refrigerant and recharge the system with the correct 
amount. 

• A failed compressor must be returned with the inlet and outlet 
ports sealed using the plastic caps from the replacement 
compressor. Otherwise the “failed” compressor will be dam¬ 
aged by moisture, and it will be impossible for Warranty to ana¬ 
lyze it. 

Compressors with plastic pullies: 

• Avoid impact on the plastic pulley (through tools, contact with 
base) 

• Send back damaged compressors only in original packaging. 

Note: It is important to perform the following running-in 

procedure when operating a new compressor for the 
first time. 

• Switch off air conditioning system 

• Set all air outlet nozzles on the instrument panel to "OFF" 

• Start engine and allow idle speed to stabilize 

• Set blower capacity to min. 75% of the maximum blower 
capacity 

• Switch on air conditioning and allow to run for at least 2 min¬ 
utes at idle speed. Risk of damage at higher speed! (Refer to 
BMW Diagnostic Equipment Service Functions for more 
detailed instructions) 

Note: When replacing a compressor you must follow the 

instructions on refilling the refrigerant oil. For details 
on compressor replacement and oil capacities are 
found in the Operating Fluids Information in TIS. 




Leak Testing the A/C System 

Always be aware of the safety measures associated with handling 
refrigerant as far as wearing eye protection, gloves and respiratory 
eguipment. (Refer to Safety Section) 

If the refrigerant leak was not identified during the evacuation, the 
system must be filled before it can be tested for leaks with either 
dye or the electronic leak detection device. 



Typical Electronic Leak Detector 


Using a leak detector like this takes experience and practice. Many 
times an oily black dust collects on or around leaking component. 
This evidence of escaping oil and refrigerant and is a very good 
place to start. 

To check for a leak with dye, the dye has to be added to the sys¬ 
tem and then monitored using an ultraviolet lamp and special safe¬ 
ty glasses. When the ultraviolet beam of light shines on the sus¬ 
pected component/area, it reflects a yellow glow as evidence of the 
refrigerant leak. 



Typical Fluorescent Dye Leak Detector Kit 


These are some helpful leak testing tips to keep in mind: 

• It is better to check the Low Side for leaks with the A/C sys¬ 
tem off. 

• The High Side is best checked for leaks with the A/C system 
on. 

• Refrigerant is heavier than air. Therefore you must always test 
below the suspected lines, connections and components. 

• Solvent fumes, wind and cooling fans may throw off your diag¬ 
nosis. 

• Remember that refrigerant dye stains and a leak inside the 
vehicle like an evaporator can damage the interior. 

• Evaporator leaks are best diagnosed with an electronic leak 
detector at the outlet vents and at the condensation drain with 
the system off. 

Note: Refer to SI B 04 14 04 “A/C Leak Detection Kit” R- 
134a A/C dye leak tester has been approved for use 
on BMW Group vehicles.

Normal Operation Pressure Readings 



Index 

Explanation 

1 

Low pressure - normal 1 to 2 bar (1 5 to 30psi) 

2 

High pressure - normal 10 tol 5 bar (1 50 to 225psi) 


These pressures will vary depending on outside temperature and 
humidity. Readings that differ from above are not considered cor¬ 
rect and may indicate a problem. Proper interpretation of these 
reading will allow you to make an accurate diagnosis of the system. 

Although the typical outlet temperature for a properly operating 
system should be 20° lower than the current ambient temperature, 
outlet temperature may range between 40 to 68°F at any given 
time depending on outside temperature and humidity. 

Note: Refer to S.I.B. # 641392 (3646) for nominal air 
conditioning system pressures R12/R134a.

Low Pressure Readings 

• A Low pressure reading in both High and Low gauges usually 
indicates Low refrigerant charge. 

• Very low pressures on both sides, with even a vacuum reading 
on the low side will typically indicate: 

- A restriction on the receiver dryer (with auxiliary fan on) 

- Expansion valve restricted or not opening (with auxiliary fan 
on) 

- The low pressure on high side here indicates a restriction 
because as the refrigerant is trapped in the condenser (not 
circulating) the auxiliary fan continues to cool it and thus 
lowers its pressure. 


High Pressure Readings 

• A High pressure reading on the Low side typically indicates 
overcharging 

• A high pressure on the Low side may indicate an open expan¬ 
sion valve. 

• A high pressure reading on both high and Low side typically 
would indicate 

- Overcharging 

- Condenser cooling fan not working 

- Oil saturation of the system (condenser) 

- Expansion Valve Stuck Open (not closing) 


Combined High and Low Pressures 

• Low pressure high and high pressure low normally indicates: 

- Reduced Compressor output 

- Compressor belt slipping 

- Compressor clutch defective 

- Compressor control defective 

- Compressor control failure 

• Low pressure low and high pressure normal to high. 

- Restriction in dryer (auxiliary fan NOT on) 

Note: These examples are just for sole purpose of the 

explanation of the system operation. In service, sys¬ 
tem pressures may behave differently based on the 
conditions at the time of testing.

Safety Precautions 

The following safety precautions should be observed when work¬ 
ing on an automotive refrigeration system: 

• Always wear eye protection and gloves while handling refriger¬ 
ant or servicing an air conditioning system. 

• Avoid breathing R-134a vapor or mist; 
exposure may irritate eyes, nose, 
throat, and lungs. 

• If refrigerant or compressor oil con¬ 
tacts the skin or eyes, rinse the affect¬ 
ed area with warm water, administer 
first aid immediately, and consult a 
doctor. 

• Use only, approved service eguipment 
to discharge A/C systems. 

• If an accidental discharge occurs, ven¬ 
tilate the work area. 

• Store refrigerant service eguipment and bulk supply contain¬ 
ers in a cool, dry location away from direct sunlight and other 
heat sources (<113° F, (45° C). 

• Do not expose refrigerant to an open flame, since burning 
refrigerant can produce poisonous gas. This includes open 
flames (such as in a propane leak detector), portable heaters, 
and lit cigarettes. 

• Do not pressure-test service eguipment or vehicle A/C sys¬ 
tems with an air/R-134a mixture. Some mixtures of air and R- 
134a are combustible at elevated pressures. The use of com¬ 
pressed air for leak detection in an R-134a system could result 
in a fire or explosion. 


• Never weld or steam-clean any part of the air conditioning sys¬ 
tem. Heating the refrigerant in a closed system could cause an 
explosion, due to the increased pressure. 

• Always consider R-12 or R-134a to be under high pressure, 
whether in the automobile refrigeration system, service eguip¬ 
ment, or refrigerant storage containers. 

• R-134a should only be handled by competent, informed per¬ 
sonnel using approved procedures and equipment. Failure to 
do so may result in serious injury and/or substantial equipment 
or vehicle damage. 

• Removal of R-134a must be carried out using R-134a equip¬ 
ment that meets the requirements of SAE J2210. 

• If accidental discharge occurs, ventilate the work area before 
resuming service. 

• Exposure to high concentrations of refrigerant vapor can 
induce anesthetic effects such as weakness, dizziness, and 
nausea. 

• Do not discharge refrigerant into the atmosphere; contain it. 

• R134a is heavier than air; if discharged into the atmosphere, it 
can replace the air, causing suffocation. 

• If R-12 is discharged into the air it damages the environment. 


Note: Refer to repair instructions of group 64 for safety pre¬ 
cautions when handling refrigerant oil (for refrigerant 
R 134a)

Climate Control Systems 


There are a few different types of BMW climate control systems. 
Most of the current US vehicles are equipped with fully automatic 
climate control systems (IHKA). Each climate control system has 
different features and functions depending upon the vehicle appli¬ 
cation. 

IHKS 

Translated from German, the acronym means “Integrated Heating 
and Air Conditioning Control. This system does not regulate the 
interior temperature of the passenger compartment automatically. 
IHKS is single zone system, controlled directly by the driver to 
achieve the desired level of comfort and was installed on the 
E36/5(318ti), E36/7(Z3) and the E52 Z8 as standard equipment. 

IHKR 

The IHKR system is a “semi-automatic” climate control system. 
Interior air temperature is controlled automatically, but air distribu¬ 
tion and blower speed are controlled from the control panel by the 
driver. IHKR was used on the some early vehicles such as the E34 
and E36 (up to 95). The most recent use of the IHKR system was 
on the E39 525, E53 X5 3.0, E46 325 and the E85 Z4 as stan¬ 
dard equipment (IHKA was available as an option). IHKR is also a 
single zone system, with only one temperature control for the 
entire passenger cabin. 

IHKA 

This is a fully automatic climate control system. Air distribution, 
blower speed and temperature regulation are controlled automati¬ 
cally. The system is designed to maintain the driver desired tem¬ 
perature setting automatically by monitoring interior temperature. 
The IHKA system is a dual zone system, with 2 temperature con¬ 


trols with some exceptions (the E46, E85 and E83 X3 with basic 
single zone IHKA). IHKA was first installed on 7 and 8 series vehi¬ 
cles. The system was added to the 3 series (E36, E46), then to 
the 5 series E39, E53 and it is currently available on all US mod¬ 
els. 

FKA(E70) 

This is a rear climate control system that is available currently on 
the E70 X5. By combining IHKA with FKA the system is consid¬ 
ered to be a true 4 zone system. Every passenger has the option 
to change the temperature of his sitting area independently with 
respect to the other occupants. 

FKA (E66) 

This is a Rear Compartment Air Conditioning system (FKA), avail¬ 
able as an option on the E66. The rear compartment air condition¬ 
er is located in the front area of the luggage compartment. The 
control and integration of the rear compartment air conditioning 
system in the IHKA refrigerant circuit is designed so that inde¬ 
pendent operation is possible for either the front or rear unit. 


Note: BMW Climate Control Systems may be Coolant 
(water) Temperature Regulated or Air Temperature 
Regulated depending on the model. 




E70 Dual Zone IHKA 


E70 Dual Zone IHKA 



Fresh air or recirculated air can be routed directly to the air 
ducts via the evaporator and appropriate bypass, without 
being routed through the system’s heater core. The airflow 
(fresh air or recirculated air) is first routed via the evaporator 
in the heating/ air-conditioning housing, provided that the 
A/C compressor has been activated, cooled and then heated 
to the reguired temperature via the heating system. 

Due to its dual section heater core, the IHKA allows separate 
and individual 2- zone, right/left temperature control. This is 
achieved in part, through the use of left and right tempera¬ 
ture sensors. The desired temperature is fine tuned via two 
water control valves (left/right). The water flow through the 
heater core is aided with the use of an auxiliary water pump 
in the case of vehicles with the N62 engine (the N52 engine 
has an electric water pump thus no auxiliary pump is need¬ 
ed)

• Four additional outlet temperature sensors 

• A separate rear blower 

• Air ducts and outlets in the B-pillars

E66 Rear Air Conditioning FKA 

From E66 series launch, a Rear Compartment Air Conditioning 
system (FKA) may be installed as an option. The rear compartment 
air conditioner is located in the front area of the luggage compart¬ 
ment and consequently reduces the volume of the luggage com¬ 
partment by about 20 percent (incl. trim panels). 

The control and integration of the rear compartment air condition¬ 
ing system in the IHKA refrigerant circuit is designed so that inde¬ 
pendent operation is possible for either the front or rear unit. 


The air required for rear compartment air conditioning is drawn in 
via a particle filter (recirculated air filter) from the luggage compart¬ 
ment with the use of a rear blower fan. 



3 2 1 


The rear system shares some of the Main (front) A/C system’s 
components like compressor, condenser and dryer and the operate 
independently from each other separated by two refrigerant shut off 
valves. 

Operation of the rear air conditioning system from two separate 
control panels and takes place by means of push-buttons and 
rotary knobs, of which only those on the right are "intelligent." 
These two control panels must be matched with respect to each 
other; i.e. the right-hand control panel must be calibrated with the 
exact end stop values of the potentiometers of the left-hand control 
panel. (Refer to the relevant service information on TIS) 

The rear compartment air conditioning system additionally supplies 
cold air to an integrated refrigerator box. This refrigerator box 
should not be confused with the electrically operated refrigerator 
box that is optionally available also for the E65.

of the refrigerant charge.

E70 Third Row Heating/Ventilation 

The E70 with 3rd row seats uses a heating and ventilation system 
referred to as HB3SR. The blower is switched on and off using the 
button near the center air outlet. The air distribution at the ventila¬ 
tion air vents in the third row seats is controlled using a knurled 
adjusting wheel with control flap. A PTC heating element is activat¬ 
ed via the limit position switch operated by the knurled adjusting 
wheel.

IHKA Systems 


Water-based Temperature Controlled IHKA 

Although IHKA is available in single and dual zone, most current 
BMW vehicles are dual zone systems. 

Due to the split design of a dual section heater core, the dual zone 
IHKA allows for separate 2- zone right/left temperature control by 
varying the water temperature on either side of the system. 

The heater core uses two temperature sensors and the tempera¬ 
ture is controlled via two water valves (left/right) that regulate water 
flow through the system based on the reguested Driver/Passenger 
temperature settings. These water valves are electrically pulsed 
and are typically sprung open when deactivated. 

Typical Dual Zone Water Temperature Controlled System 


The water are valves pulsed to regulate temperature based on the 
following inputs: 

• Left/Right temperature settings 

• Left/Right heater core temperatures 

• Outside temperature 

• Interior temperature 

• “Y” factor 

An auxiliary water pump is used to ensure the adeguate volume of 
coolant through both sides of the heater core to comply with the 
system’s reguirements. This pump is Typically powered directly 
from the IHKA control module through a final stage output.

The auxiliary pump is used to supply coolant for the REST feature 
of the IHKA, although not all models use one. Some current vehi¬ 
cles use electric main water pumps and no longer need auxiliary 
water pumps. 

The air-mass flow (fresh air or re-circulated air) is first routed via 
the evaporator in the heating/air-conditioning housing (provided 
that the compressor has been activated) to be cooled, dried and 
then heated to the reguired temperature via the heating system 
heater core. The air is cooled and dried in the evaporator at the 
same time and the condensation is led away via the drains of the 
heater/AC air box. 

Fresh air or re-circulated air can be routed directly to the air ducts 
via the evaporator and appropriate bypass, without being routed 
through the heating system heater core. 

Note: Current vehicles that use Water-based Temperature 
are E53, E6X, E70, E83.

Air-based Temperature Controlled IHKA 

The temperature for the best possible interior climate in an air con¬ 
trolled system is regulated with a mixer flap in this type of system. 
A water valve that controls the water flow rate through the heater 
core (as in the water base system) is not used in an air-based tem¬ 
perature control system. A temperature mixer flap is integrated in 
the heater/air box housing and is used for adjusting the reguested 
temperature.

Temperature mixer flap 


When the temperature mixer flap routes the fresh air or recycled air 
through the heater core completely, maximum heating capacity is 
realized. When it is not necessary to heat the air, the heater is cov¬ 
ered off by the temperature mixer flap and the air is deflected away. 
A corresponding proportion of cold air to warm air is mixed with the 
flap in the intermediate positions, thus achieving and controlling the 
out let temperature in the vehicle based on the reguested cus¬ 
tomer settings and calculated values. The temperature mixer flap is 
operated by a stepper motor which is controlled by the IHKA/IHKR 
control unit. 

This type of temperature control is used on the E85 as a single 
zone as well as in the E9X vehicles as a dual zone.

A disadvantage of this control system is the large package space it 
reguires. In the case of complaints ("poor heating output" or resid¬ 
ual heating in "cold" setting) particular care must be taken to 
ensure that the mixer flap rests snugly on the stops in the corre¬ 
sponding end positions. 

As in the water-based temperature control system (signal for water 
valves), the control variable signal Y is calculated from the tempera¬ 
ture set-point and the various temperature sensors (Y Factor). 

The respective position of the temperature mixer flap is derived 
from this signal. It also determines the position of the air distribu¬ 
tion flaps as well as the automatic blower output control when the 
automatic button is pressed. 






























E90 AirTemperature Controlled System 


The temperature inside the vehicle is controlled by means of a 
master controller. Control is based on the nominal values set and 
the calculated actual value (the nominal values are the requested 
temperature settings). The actual value is calculated from the tem¬ 
peratures measured by the interior temperature sensor and the 
footwell temperature sensor. 

The lead parameter is calculated from the comparison between the 
actual value for the interior temperature and the corrected nominal 
value (calculated from temperature request, interior temperature 
and ambient temperature). 

Compared to the set specification, the interior temperature is raised 
in the cold so that a comfortable level is achieved even at negative 
temperatures, despite the temperature setting being unchanged. 

A separate temperature setting for the driver's side and the front- 
passenger side makes 2 mixer flaps necessary for a dual zone sys¬ 
tem.

The temperature for the best possible interior climate in an air con¬ 
trolled system is regulated with a mixer flap in the heater/air condi¬ 
tioner. 

Coolant flow is constant in the heater core as the mass airflow is 
fed through the evaporator. As this happens, the air is cooled and 
dried (providing the air-conditioning system is switched on). The 
mixer flap then feeds the air completely or in part over the heating 
system heater core, depending on the desired temperature value 
set at the IHKA control panel the airflow is subsequently mixed 
again. The air-mass is then fed through the ventilation flaps and 
into the vehicle interior. 


Vent Temperature Stratification 

Stratification in the climate control system refers to the mixing of 
the air temperature at the outlet vents. Hot, warm or cold air can be 
adjusted as it comes out of the front or rear outlet vents no matter 
what main temperature setting was selected on the IHKA. This is 
realized by mixing hot and cold air with the use of blend air flap. 

Front stratification refers to the components necessary to adjust 
the dash outlet vent temperature to the occupant’s preference. 
Rear stratification refers to the rear passenger compartment air 
delivery vents. 

Thumbwheel adjusters on or near the vents are the typically con¬ 
nected to the mixing flaps mechanically (Bowden cable) or elec¬ 
tronically (Potentiometers and stepper motors). 


Climate Control Workbook 

61 










62 

Climate Control Workbook 




Typical Stratification Process 


Stratification is realized mechanically and electronically: 

• Mechanical stratification is through the use of a Bowden cable 
connected from the air mixing flap to a thumbwheel adjuster 
mounted on or near the vent. 


The adjustment is done by manipulating the air mixing flap 
depending on: 

• Thumbwheel and Bowden cable position (mechanical) 

• Vent outlet temperature sensor readings 

• Occupant requested settings (Potentiometer position at the 
thumbwheel adjusters) 

• Occupant selected settings on the I Drive CID screen under 
climate control menu. 



E70 CID Vent Stratification Settings 


• Electronic stratification adjusts the air mixing flaps with the use Note: In vehicles with CID (E6X or E70) the air stratification 
of stepper motors. can be adjusted through the I Drive and CID screen at 

the climate control settings. 


















The Y Factor 


Typical Y Factor Chart 


The reference variable Y Factor (in %) is derived from the compari¬ 
son of the actual interior temperature value with the corrected tar¬ 
get value = driver's choice + outside temperature application. 

Although air temperature controlled systems work in similar 
manner, in a coolant temperature controlled system: 

Y Factor of 0% = water valves closed = NO heating output. 

Y Factor of 100% = water valves open = FULL heating output. 

The master controller sends the signal to the two lower-ranking 
auxiliary controllers on the left and right. The auxiliary controller 
relieves the burden on the master controller in that it corrects inter¬ 
ference such as air volume and water flow fluctuations or coolant 
and fresh air temperature variations that would otherwise be notice¬ 
able as variations in the temperature in the passenger compart¬ 
ment. 

The opening time of the water valves is calculated from the differ¬ 
ence of the auxiliary controller set point and the actual heat 
exchanger temperature. The water valves are activated pulse-width 
modulated with a period duration of 3600 ms. 


This control variable Y represents the basis for further fundamental 
functions of the IHKA such as: 

• Automatic blower output control in the automatic program 

• Air distribution flap adjustment in the automatic program 

• Auxiliary water pump operation ON/OFF 

• Cold start interlock 

• Compensation of solar sensor influence

Y-FACTOR 


The lower the Y-factor number, the harder the system is working to 
cool down the interior; the higher the number, the harder the sys¬ 
tem is working to warm up the interior. In the middle region, the 
system is working to maintain the existing interior temperature. 


Note: It is not possible to view the Y-Factor parameter in all 
vehicles and the typical Y-range of 0 tol 00% temper¬ 
ature control has been extended from -200% to 
+300% to comply with current IHKA system func¬ 
tions.

Climate Control Components 


Climate Control Panel/Module (E90 IHKA) 

The control and operating module is the control center of the 
heating and air conditioning system. It is the point where all the 
necessary sensor data is processed and the reguired settings can 
be entered. 

Since the E90 a new feature of the control module is that it no 
longer directly controls all functions and components like in other 
models but rather makes use of other control modules for this 
purpose (distributed functions). 

The E90 IHKA panel is directly responsible for the following: 

• SZM switch input 

• Solar sensor input 

• Receives the rear stratification knob (rheostat) signal 

• Receives ventilation, footwell, and evaporator temperature 
sensor signals 

The IHKA panel indirectly receives 

• Condensation sensor signal via the K-CAN. 

The signal path is: Condensation sensor-> FZD => K-CAN 
->IHKA 


Digital Motor Electronics (DME) Control Module 

The DME control unit performs the following functions: 

• Actuates the Engine cooling fan for cooling of the condenser. 

• Interfaces with the IHKA control unit via the bus network for 
the compressor release signal. 


• Interfaces with the IHKA control unit for operation of the 
engine’s electric water pump for the residual heat feature. 

Junction Box (JB) 

The junction box is extremely important to the IHKA system. It is 
responsible for the following functions: 

• Output signal for seat heating. 

The signal path is: SZM => ribbon cable => IHKA => 
K-CAN=> JBE => SHM/SMFA 

• Rear window defogger 

The signal path is: IHKA => K-CAN => JBE (relay) => 

Rear window defogger filters/grid 

• Blower motor operating voltage 

• Refrigerant control valve (in compressor) 

The signal path is: IHKA => K-CAN => JBE => Operating 
voltage for valve 

• Gateway to the PT-CAN for bi-directional communication 
between the IHKA and DME. 

The signal path is: IHKA <=> K-CAN <=> JBE <=> PT-CAN 
<=> DME 

• Receives the rear stratification knob (rheostat) signal 




• Receives refrigerant pressure sensor signal 

The signal path is: Pressure sensor => JBE => K-CAN 
=> IHKA 

• Receives AUC sensor signal 

The signal path is: AUC sensor-> JBE => K-CAN => IHKA 

• Splice point for the ambient air temperature sensor 

The signal path is: Ambient air temperature sensor => 
hardwire => through JB => IKE 


Roof Control Panel (FZD) 

The roof control panel is used to relay the condensation sensor 
signal to the IHKA. It takes the signal from the condensation sensor 
and places it on the K-CAN. 

Car Access System (CAS) 

The CAS assigns a personal identification code to every remote 
control. The CAS transfers the personal identification code to the 
IHKA control unit via the K-CAN. 

The ID code “Key-based settings” (Key Memory) are stored in the 
IHKA control unit. 

When the vehicle is unlocked, the remote control unit used is rec¬ 
ognized. The settings stored for this unit are called up and execut¬ 
ed. While entering the sleep mode (run-down period), the current 
settings are stored for the remote control unit in use at that time. 


Car Communication Computer (CCC) 

If the vehicle is eguipped with a navigation system, the signals from 
the controller for selecting the menus and sub-menu are 
processed in the CCC. 

To actuate the CID (Central Information Display), the red-green- 
blue signals from the graphics processor are converted into Low 
Voltage Differential Signalling (LVDS) digital signals. 


Central Information Display 

The following control and display functions are selected and acti¬ 
vated with the controller in the CID (Central Information Display): 

• Air distribution setting - The defrost flaps, ventilation flaps and 
footwell flaps can be individually set in the air distribution sub¬ 
menu. 

• Automatic mode - The intensity of the IHKA can be set in the 
automatic mode submenu. In other words, the automatic influ¬ 
ence of the climate conditions outside the vehicle on the air 
volume and the opening angle of the flaps can be set to one 
of three different settings (low, medium, high). 


Center Console Switch Cluster (SZM) 

The center console switch cluster (SZM) is connected by means of 
a 14-wire ribbon cable directly to the IHKA control module. The 
commands from the SZM are then transmitted via K-CAN to the 
corresponding systems. 

The A/C control and operating unit is also responsible for activation 
of the LEDs for function and backlighting.

Interior Temperature Sensor 

The interior temperature sensor is a NTC type thermistor, typically 
mounted in the IHKA panel. To promote adequate airflow across 
the sensing element a small puller type fan is used. Fan and sensor 
work together provide an interior cabin temperature input to the 
IHKA control module. 


E60 IHKA Interior Temperature Sensor 



'"--T. 


AUC Sensor 

The AUC sensor, originally located in the lower right corner of the 
fan shroud, samples ambient air that has entered the engine com¬ 
partment. The sensor contains a gas sensor, which measures the 
level of oxidizable gases in air. These include hydrocarbons, NOx, 
SOx and CO. The AUC sensor sends a voltage signal to the control 
panel/module according to the concentration of these pollutants. 

If a high level of pollutants is detected, the control panel/module 
activates the recirculating air mode as follows: 

• In heating mode, recirculating air is used for a maximum of 
3 minutes. 


If the level of oxidizable gases drops to an acceptable point before 
the time limit is reached, the IHKA system switches back to fresh 
air intake. If air quality has not improved at the end of the time limit, 
the system switches to fresh air briefly and then back to recirculat¬ 
ing mode for another 3 or 10 minute period. 


E90 AUC Sensor Location 



Note: Operating strategies of the AUC sensor may vary 
from model to model. 


In cooling mode, recirculating air is used for a maximum of 
10 minutes. 


Solar Sensor 

The solar sensor records the light intensity of the insolation to 
which the vehicle interior is being subjected separately for the right 
and left-hand sides. The influence of insolation on the temperature 
in the vehicle interior is compensated for in automatic mode by 
means of temperature specified value control intervention. 



E60 Solar Sensor 

Typically located in the center of the dashboard or integrated to the 
rain light sensor assembly like on E70. The solar sensor consists of 
a light sensitive diode that provides the IHKA module with inputs of 
sunlight intensity. 

The input is used as a measure of the solar heating effect on vehi¬ 
cle occupants. The sensor signals will influence blower output, air 
stratification and ventilation flap operation. 

Condensation Sensor 

Introduced with the E60 model, this sensor varies its frequency out 
put in response to the presence of humidity and temperature in the 
windshield area. This information is sent to the IHKA control 


module via a digital signal with a varying frequency. This informa¬ 
tion is evaluated by the IHKA control module, which then imple¬ 
ments a series of countermeasures to prevent windshield fogging. 

On the current E60 the condensation sensor is mounted under the 
rain light sensor (RLS) on the mirror base. Other names for the 
condensation sensor are Mist, Fogging, and Humidity sensor.

The sensor is located beneath the RLS on the windshield below 
the cover for the base of the rearview mirror. A special locating tool 
is used to install the new sensor, this tool is supplied with the 
replacement sensor. The sensor is affixed to the windshield with an 
adhesive. If the sensor needs to be removed from the windshield it 
must be replaced.

When moisture is detected by the Condensation Sensor, the fol¬

Rain/Driving Light Solar Sensor 

The rain/driving light solar sensor RLSS of the E70 is clipped into a 
retaining ring beneath the windshield mirror base cover. The 
rain/driving light solar sensor separately records the insolation act¬ 
ing upon the vehicle occupants for the left and right halves of the 
vehicle. It generates two signals that are proportional to the insola¬ 
tion acting upon the vehicle occupants. 

The temperature rise due to heat from sun radiation in the vehicle 
interior is compensated for in automatic mode by means of tem¬ 
perature specified value control intervention. 

The sensor signal is read in by the FZD via the LIN bus and relayed 
to the IHKA via the K-CAN. 

The signals are used by the IHKA to regulate the left and right air 
volume and ventilation temperature. 


• Defroster Flaps open further 

• Fresh Air Flaps open 100% 

• Blower speed is increased 

• Footwell Flaps are closed 

• Temperature increases 

• Evaporator Temperature threshold 
goes to minimum 


These measures are implemented one after another until wind¬ 
shield fogging is eliminated. Further steps are initiated if one meas¬ 
ure proves to be ineffective. After successfully eliminating wind¬ 
shield fogging, the measures are gradually cancelled in steps. 



E70 RLSS Sensor 













Outlet Temperature Sensor 

NTC Sensors are installed in the air outlet vents in order to monitor 
air vent temperature delivered. This is a crucial parameter in the cal¬ 
culation of the ideal outlet temperature with regard to the request¬ 
ed temperature value. 

Depending if the system is single, dual zone or four zones like E70, 
these sensors operate in the same manner and in all cases are 
located in the middle of the air delivery. In the case of a four zone 
system the driver, front passenger and rear seat passengers may 
have their own individual temperature settings. This is in part possi¬ 
ble because of the use of these individual outlet vent temperature 
sensors and PTC heaters in the rearfootwell vents.

The vent temperature is also adjusted locally at the dash face vents 
or the rear delivery vents by means of the stratification potentiome¬ 
ter thumbwheel adjusters. This is still done with a cable in some 
current vehicles like X3. 

Refrigerant High/Low Pressure Sensor 

The pressure sensor is mounted on the liquid reservoir and sends 
out a voltage signal depending on the pressure in the air condition¬ 
ing system. 

This signal is transferred in the form of a telegram to the digital 
motor electronics (DME). In turn, the DME outputs the control volt¬ 
age for the output stage of the auxiliary fan, thus activating the cor¬ 
responding fan stage (speed) or shutting down the compressor to 
prevent damage in response to very high pressures. Activation of 
the auxiliary fan is also influenced by an excessively high coolant 
temperature. 

On vehicles equipped with a condenser module (filter dryer inte¬ 
grated in the condenser), the pressure sensor is installed in the 
high pressure line between the condenser and expansion valve. 

On various automatic transmission vehicles such as the E65 and 
E60, the auxiliary fan is also activated by excessively high transmis¬ 
sion fluid temperature. The higher fan stage is then generated in 
this case.

Evaporator Temperature Sensor 

The sensor is installed between the evaporator fins or arranged 
behind the evaporator in the flow of cold air. Depending on the type 
of system in the vehicle, the temperature at the evaporator is moni¬ 
tored as the regulator switches the electromagnetic clutch of the 
compressor on and off or signals the compressor control valve 
(clutchless compressor) as reguired. This prevents the evaporator 
fins from icing up due to frozen condensed water. 

Controlled via the IHKA control unit, the sensor generally switches 
off the compressor at a temperature of about. 1°C and on again at 
about. 3°C. 

In connection with the output-controlled compressors with mag¬ 
netic clutch, the sensor only serves as a protection function in the 
event that the temperature at the evaporator drops below 3°C. 
Conseguently, the compressor remains switched on almost perma¬ 
nently. With the interior temperature set at comfortable levels, the 
compressor is generally switched off by the electromagnetic clutch 
only at outside temperatures below about. 6°C. 

In the case of output-controlled compressors without an electro¬ 
magnetic clutch, if there is a threat of the evaporator icing up, the 
IHKA will correspondingly change the pulse-width-modulated con¬ 
trol signal via the electric control valve in the compressor. 
Conseguently, the compressor output is reduced in the direction of 
zero. Icing of the evaporator can be recognized by decreasing air 
volume at the air outlet vents. 


Note: Evaporator temperature sensor is shown by #6 
in the illustration.

Heater Core Temperature Sensors Left/Right 

Heater core temperature is monitored to insure the correct desired 
temperature at the vents. Heater core temperature along with 
ambient, vent and evaporator temperatures are the main parame¬ 
ters utilized to calculate Y Factor. Thus we control the coolant flow 
though the heater core by varying the heater valve opening on a 
water based system. 

The Air based System has no need for a water valve because it 
controls temperature by adjusting the air mixing flap. 

As an added benefit we also monitor heater core temperature in 
other to maintain a safe range of operation and in case of over 
heating the heater valves can be shut off. 

In IHKAthe individual temperature readings are of crucial impor¬ 
tance and necessary in other to be able to separately adjust the 
outlet temperature for the driver and the passenger. This calls for 
the installation of two heater core temperature sensors. 

E60 Heater Core Temperature Sensor 



Ambient Outside Temperature 

The ambient temperature sensor is similar to interior, evaporator, 
heater core and outlet vent sensors in their operation. An NTC neg¬ 
ative temperature coefficient sensor as temperature goes up resist¬ 
ance goes down. 

The temperature sensor is located at the front end of the vehicle in 
front of the condenser and it is responsible for reporting ambient 
temperatures to all systems that reguire the reading.

Compressor Operation 

The compressor control circuit varies between systems. There are 
three basic methods for compressor control. 

• The compressor clutch coil receives power from the KL 87 
terminal of a relay which is ground controlled by ECM (DME). 

• The compressor clutch is powered directly by the climate con¬ 
trol module. A final stage in the control module sends power 
directly to the compressor clutch. The relay and additional 
wiring are eliminated. 

• Constantly engaged compressors are usually variable dis¬ 
placement units. The compressor has a swash plate that can 
vary the amount of compression on the refrigerant with the 
input from a control valve. 

The compressor valve is controlled and powered by the junction 
box in most resent models but the command comes from the IHKA 
module. 


Blower Motor/Final Stage 

The fresh air/recirculated air blower is flange mounted to the right 
side of the IHKA housing. The specified voltage for the blower is 
provided by the IHKA (Master) as a defined control signal (PWM 
signal) via a single-wire interface of the blower output stage (Slave). 

The blower motor is actuated by the blower output stage depend¬ 
ing on this variable control signal. The line connections from the 
IHKA to the final stage are monitored by the IHKA. 

The blower and the output stage can be replaced separately. See 
appropriate workshop systems documentation. The motor voltage 
is limited to 12.5V by the software. If an overload is detected at the 
output stage output or temperature protection is activated, the 
engine output is reduced.

Climate Control Workbook 


Water Valves 

Temperature regulation on IHKA systems is accomplished by sole¬ 
noid actuated water valve(s). The valve(s) are normally held open by 
spring pressure (fail safe), and are electrically pulse width modulat¬ 
ed by the IHKA control module (B+) signal to regulate the flow of 
hot coolant through the heater core(s). 

The water valve(s) are pulsed according to the Y-factor, which is cal¬ 
culated from the following inputs: 

• Desired temperature reguest (left and right if eguipped) 

• Interior temperature 

• Heater core temperature(s) 

• Ambient air temperature 

• Blower speed reguest 

When the desired temperature E60 Water Valve 
calls for maximum heat, the water 
valve(s) do not receive pulses and 
are mechanically sprung open. 

Similarly, when maximum cooling 
is reguested, the IHKA control 
module powers the water valve(s) 
completely closed. The water 
valves used on the water temper¬ 
ature controlled dual zone IHKA 
systems have one inlet and two 
outlets on a single valve. 


Water Valve (Air Temperature Control) 

A water valve that controls the water flow rate through the down¬ 
stream heater core is not used for setting the temperature in an air- 
based temperature control system but rather a temperature mixer 
flap is integrated in the heater/air conditioner. 

A single water valve is typically used to control the amount of heat 
sent to the heater core on an Air Temperature Controlled Systems, 
although most current vehicles (E85, E9X) don’t use one. 

To control the temperature desired by the dual zone climate control 
system, air mixing flaps are used. 

Auxiliary Water Pumps 

Typically used on Water Regulated Systems. Electrically powered 
auxiliary coolant pump ensure that an adeguate supply of hot 
coolant is always available to the heater core(s). The IHKA control 
module operates the pump directly or through a relay by supplying 
the ground circuit. 

Some current vehicles use electric water pumps and don’t need to 
use an auxiliary pump to maintain adeguate coolant flow through 
the heater core. 





E60 Auxiliary Water Pump 


Electric Water Pumps 

The current N52 and N54 engines are equipped with electronically 
controlled water pumps. Electric water pumps decreased warm up 
time while enhancing power output and fuel economy. 

When the residual heat (REST) function is activated, the IHKA con¬ 
trol unit interfaces with the DME control module to activate the 
electric water pump. The water pump allows hot/warm coolant to 
flow through the heater core and warm the passenger compart¬ 
ment. 

The coolant pump of the N54 engine is an electrically driven cen¬ 
trifugal pump with a power output of 400W and a maximum flow 
rate of 9000 l/h. This represents a significant increase in power of 
the electric coolant pump used in the N52 engine, which has a 
power output of 200 W and a maximum flow rate of 7000 l/h. 

The DME (ECM) uses the engine load, the operating mode and 
the data from the temperature sensors to calculate the required 
cooling output. Based on this data, the DME issues the correspon¬ 
ding command to the electric coolant pump. 

The electric coolant pump regulates its speed in accordance with 
this command. The system coolant flows through the motor of the 
coolant pump, thus cooling both the motor as well as the electronic 
module. The coolant lubricates the bearings of the electric coolant 
pump. 



Electric Water Pump 


Note: The pump must be filled with coolant when removed 
for service to prevent any corrosion. Also, the pump 
impeller must be turned by hand before installation 
to ensure the pump is not seized.

Map Thermostat 

In view of the fact that an intelligent heat management system has 
an influence on fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, performance 
and comfort according to engine temperature, this data-map ther¬ 
mostat was developed for use with such a system. 


When the over-temperature light in the instrument cluster is on 
(120°C), the fan is run in the overrun function. This signal is provid 
ed to the ECM (DME) via the CAN bus. When this occurs, the fan 
is run at a frequency of 10Hz. 


The data-map thermostat successfully integrates modern engine 
management electronics. That combination is achieved by placing 
an electrically heated resistor in the expanding element of the ther¬ 
mostat. 

That data map is determined, for example, by the following param¬ 
eters: 

• Engine load 

• Engine speed 

• Vehicle speed 

• Intake-air temperature 

• Coolant temperature

Stepper Motors 

BMW IHKR and IHKA Climate Control Systems use 12 volt DC 
electric stepper motors to operate many of the air inlet, air distribu¬ 
tion and temperature mixing flaps. While different types of stepper 
motors are used on different vehicles, they all share many desirable 
characteristics: 

• Lower power consumption 

• Operate in both directions 

• They can be started and stopped in any position 

• They provide quick movement 

• They move in precise increments 

• They do not require feedback potentiometers to 
determine position 

• They remain in position when shut off 

• They have long service life 

Conventional Stepper Motors 

Until the E38 was introduced, the stepper motors used in IHKR 
and IHKA climate control systems did not contain electronic com¬ 
ponents, and only 3 part numbers were needed to service all the 
motor assemblies. These motors consisted of copper wire coils 
wrapped around iron cores (pole pieces), and permanent magnet 
rotors, all attached to a high-reduction mechanical gearbox. The 
system electronic control components were located inside the cli¬ 
mate control module assembly. 

There up to 4 sets of winding in these motors. This circuit arrange¬ 
ment requires from 5-6 wires between the control module and the 
stepper motor. These motors were used on early climate control 
systems and are still used on some vehicles for fresh air flap opera¬ 
tion. 


“Smart” Stepper Motors 

Starting with the E38 climate control system, some of the control 
module electronics were moved into the stepper motors, making 
the E38 motors (except the fresh air flaps motor) substantially dif¬ 
ferent from the “conventional” stepper motors we’ve already dis¬ 
cussed. 

These “Smart” stepper motors use only three wires for operation. 
There is a power, a ground and the third wire for the “M” bus sig¬ 
nal. The “M” bus is used to send messages to the stepper motors. 
The commands or “messages” are sent by the climate control 
module. The stepper motors contain processors which will “inter¬ 
pret” the bus messages and actuate the stepper motors to the cor¬ 
rect position. 



Typical M-bus Diagram 


The M-bus stepper motors are different and have a different part 
number. They all feature a fixed programmed address and must 
therefore be installed in no other position than on the correspon¬ 
ding air flap, they cannot be interchanged and must be replaced 
with the same part number as was originally equipped.

the control module are much more sophisticated than with con¬ 
ventional stepper motors. The sequence of events appears below: ___.. . _ ,

The control module determines that a flap position must 
change 

It issues a “wake-up call” to alert the stepper motors that a 
command is coming 

It “names” the motor that is to respond to the command 

It issues the command signal, e.g. “move 15 steps clockwise” 

All the stepper motors “hear” the command 

Only the stepper motor that “hears its name” follows the com¬ 
mand 

The “named” stepper motor then informs the control module 
that it has carried out the command

E65 Stepper Motors 

The E65 IHKA has a total of 11 stepper motors, 1 Rapid action 
motor for the fresh air flap and 10 “Smart” Stepper motors for all 
other flaps Each of these motors contains an integrated circuit 
(MUX- 4 chip) in the plug connection housing. This 1C controls the 
winding of the motor and is linked by a M-Bus. 

All stepper motor drives are controlled by the IHKA control module 
over the M-Bus. 


Note: Faults (blockages) reported by the drives are stored 
in the IHKA control module, which responds by dis¬ 
continuing control signals to the motor in question. 


Each drive has a permanent address (stored on the chip) which is a 
unique identifier for the individual motor (for bus communication). 
The stepper motors are all different and are not interchangeable.

E60 Stepper Motors 

The E60 IHKA system uses 9, MUX5 motors (multiplex 
motor type 5). These stepper motors have different part 
numbers, are connected to the LIN Bus in parallel and are 
not interchangeable. 

The LIN Bus replaced the M-Bus. This bus circuit consists of 
2 three wires, power (B+), ground and the LIN bus signal wire. 

The stepper motors for the fresh air/recirculation air flaps are 
designed as high speed motors. This system does not use 
any bowden cables for flap actuation.

E9X Stepper Motors 

The current E9X IHKA systems utilizes eight stepper motors that 
are wired in series for climate control operation. The IHKA control 
module also operates the stepper motors via the LIN-bus. 


• All eight stepper motors can be replaced without removing 
the dashboard or A/C housing. 

• Seven of the eight stepper motors used are identical (same 
part number). 

• A different stepper motor is used only for the fresh air/recircu¬ 
lation motor. “See the Service Information section”. 

• Flap motors are wired in series. 

• Each flap motor has a measuring resistance of about 1 ohm.

E90 Stepper Motors RH 





















Each flap motor is connected to its predecessor via this measuring 
resistance. For this reason, troubleshooting must be performed in 
the order stipulated in the schematic circuit diagram. A new gener¬ 
ation of stepper motors is used in the E90/E91/E92/E93 systems 
as well as in the current E70. 

These stepper motors feature two LIN bus connection lines 
(input/output). A motor has only one LIN-bus input on the wiring 
harness (foot-well motor). The motors are connected in series (the 
foot-well motor is the last motor in the series connection). 

Also in this case there are two different stepper motor versions. 

The motor with the designation EFB with IQ resistor, is used for all 
air flaps except the fresh air flap as well as in IHR and IHKR for the 
central (mechanism) kinematics. 

EAB Stepper Motor 

The motor with the designation EAB is used for the fresh air flap 
and the central kinematics (Air Distribution Mechanisms). The EAB 
motor varies its speed corresponding to the force applied at the 
flap. Faster at a low load force and slower at a high load force (with 
no IQ resistor). 

EAB Stepper Motor 



EFB Stepper Motor 

The EFB motor has a constant displacement speed and a defined 
moment. The EFB motors are all identical and must therefore be 
programmed. The air flap motors are connected in series. A IQ 
measuring resistor is installed in each air flap motor. The following 
air flap motor is connected to the one before it via this measuring 
resistor or shunt through the LIN-bus. The motors must be con¬ 
nected only in the seguence as shown in the schematic circuit dia¬ 
gram and electronically addressed for proper system operation.

E70 Stepper Motors 

The IHKA actuator stepper motors used on the E70 are the same 
as in the E9X. They are all designed as identical components and 
are actuated by the IHKA via the LIN bus. 

When an actuator motor is being replaced it must be ensured that 
the correct plug is connected to the relevant motor from the wiring 
harness end. The plug order can be found in the wiring diagram. 

Then an addressing run must be started using the BMW diagnos¬ 
tics system. The IHKA detects the actuators that are connected in 
series and assigns an address to the new motor if necessary. 

The actuation of the addressing run is integrated in the diagnostics 
system in the service function (re-address body, heating/air condi¬ 
tioning functions, flap motors). A function test (reference run) is 
also integrated in the diagnostics system, with which the opera¬ 
tional capability and the adjusting path of the motors can be tested. 



Replacement of a Stepper Motor 

After replacement, the stepper motor must be addressed. The 
addressing procedure is initiated with BMW Diagnostic Eguipment, 

The IHKR or IHKA control unit automatically assigns the address 
to the flap motor. The motor recognizes its assignment (address 
e.g. footwell motor) based on an addressing current. 

This arrangement makes it possible to use a standard motor for all 
air distribution flaps. The motor must not be turned by hand as this 
would pose the risk of irreparably damaging the electronics or the 
gear mechanism.

IHKA Functions and Features 


BMW vehicles are equipped with various versions of climate con¬ 
trol systems. Regardless of the version used, the objectives are 
basically the same. The climate control system is designed to per¬ 
form the following functions: 

• Remove heat from the passenger compartment when ambi¬ 
ent temperatures are above the drivers comfort zone. 

• Add heat from the passenger compartment when ambient 
temperatures are below the drivers comfort zone. 

• Dehumidify the air entering the passenger compartment. 

• Defrost front and rear windows for optimum vision and safety. 

• Remove contaminants from incoming air (with microfilter-if 
equipped). 



In addition to the above functions there are additional sub systems 
and additional features. These systems and features are not avail¬ 
able on all models. These features include: 

• Washer jet heating 

• Windshield base heating 

• “Rest” feature (residual heat) 

• “Service Station” feature 

• Parked car ventilation 

• Automatic Air Recirculation (AUC) 

• Cold start arrest

E9XIHKA Functions 

The IHKA used in the current E9X vehicles 
have the following functions: 

• Temperature control 

• Evaporator control 

• Air distribution setting 

• Airflow control 

• Sunlight adaptation (solar sensor) 

• MAX cooling 

• Residual heat 

• Defrost function 

• AUTO function 

• Heated rear window 

• OFF 

• Air recirculation mode 

• Automatic air-recirculation control 

• Condensation sensor program 

• Convertible Mode (E93) 


Temperature Control 

The temperature for the best possible interior climate is regulated 
with a mixer flap in this (air based) heater/air conditioning system. 

The air-mass flow is fed through the evaporator. As this happens, 
the air-mass flow is cooled and dried (providing the air-conditioning 
system is switched on). The mixer flap then feeds the air-mass flow 
completely or in part over the heating system heater core (depend¬ 
ing on the desired temperature value set at the IHKA control panel). 
The airflow is subsequently mixed again. The air-mass flow is then 
fed through the ventilation flaps and into the vehicle interior. 

The temperature inside the vehicle is controlled by means of a 
master controller. Temperature Control is based on the nominal val¬ 
ues set and the calculated actual value (the nominal values are set 
with 2 temperature selector knobs). 

The actual value is calculated from the temperatures measured by 
the interior temperature sensor and the footwell temperature sen¬ 
sor. 

The lead parameter is calculated from the comparison between the 
actual value for the interior temperature and the corrected nominal 
value (calculated from temperature request, interior temperature 
and ambient temperature). 

Compared to the set specification, the interior temperature is raised 
in the cold so that a comfortable level is achieved even at negative 
temperatures, despite the temperature setting being unchanged. 

The ambient temperature is transmitted to the IHKA control unit via 
the K-CAN. The separate temperature setting for the driver's side 
and the front-passenger side makes 2 mixer flaps necessary. 




Evaporator Control 

The evaporator temperature is regulated by means of the evapora¬ 
tor temperature sensor and the expansion valve. The evaporator 
temperature is set to the predefined specification of 2°C (35.6°F). 
Lower temperatures are not possible due to the risk of icing. 

If the function gradual evaporator control is encoded, the nominal 
value for the evaporator temperature will be calculated between 
2°C and 7°C (35.6°F and 44.6°F). The specification depends on 
the ambient temperature, the ventilation temperature and the 
refrigerant pressure. A variable evaporator control reduces dehu¬ 
midification. This enhances comfort for it reduces the risk of 
mucous membranes drying out. 

Air Distribution Setting 

For the best possible operation of the air distribution, it is important 
for the manually adjustable air vents to be open. 

Occupants have the possibility of allowing the air distribution to be 
decided by the automatic program (AUTO button). Alternatively, 
individual, personal settings are possible through manual selection 
(defrost, ventilation, footwell). 

If the vehicle is eguipped with navigation/CCC, it is also possible to 
make a fine adjustment via the CID (Central Information Display) in 
the submenu Air distribution. Compared to manual selection, fine 
adjustment offers the additional possibility of further individualiza¬ 
tion of the air distribution. 

Airflow Control 

The airflow control is dependent on the following settings and con¬ 
trol actions: 

• Manual blower setting 

• Automatic blower and flap setting - The automatic blower and 
flap functions are activated when the AUTO button is pressed. 

• Dynamic pressure compensation - The air volume at the air 


inlet grills increases disproportionately with increasing road 
speed. This effect is compensated for by the opening angle of 
the fresh-air flap being reduced as speed increases (dynamic 
pressure compensation). 

The opening angle is regulated according to the programming. 

• Blower control - If necessary, the power management system 
will assign priority levels to reduce the blower output (via K- 
CAN). 

• Effect of terminal 50 - When the engine is being started (ter¬ 
minal 50 ON), the blower is switched OFF to reduce the load 
on the vehicle battery. 

Front Stratification Adjustment Thumbwheel 

The front adjustment thumbwheel is part of the DSC/DTC/Hazard 
switch cluster. 

The thumbwheel signal is wired directly to the IHKA control unit as 
an analog/varying voltage signal. The IHKA panel sends the specific 
position signal to the front mixing flap motor via the LIN bus. 

Rear Stratification Adjustment Thumbwheel 

The rear adjustment thumbwheels is located to the right of the rear 
center vent. The thumbwheel potentiometer signal is wired directly 
to the JBE control unit as an analog/varying voltage signal. 

The JBE converts this signal into a digital signal over the K-CAN to 
the IHKA control unit which then sends the specific position signal 
to the rear mixing flap motor via the LIN bus.

Climate Control Workbook 


Sunlight Adaptation (solar sensor) 

How the solar sensor affects the IHKA regulation on the driver's 
side and on the front passenger side is not programmed separately. 
The following functions are modified when automatic mode is acti¬ 
vated (depending on the intensity of sunlight): 

• Blower output is increased or reduced 

• Desired temperature value is increased or reduced 

MAX Cooling 

The MAX button makes it possible for the user to select maximum 
cooling with just one press of a button at the IHKA controls. When 
the MAX button is pressed, all functions, including the defrost func¬ 
tion, are deactivated. The air conditioning function is activated (if it 
was not already activated) and defined settings are selected, 
(example: temperature control is deactivated, ventilation flaps are 
fully opened). 

Residual Heat (REST) 

The residual-heat function allows the heat from the engine to be 
used to heat up the vehicle interior when the engine is not running 
(e.g. during a stop at a level crossing). 

The residual-heat function is only 
possible for a certain run-down peri¬ 
od (15 minutes from terminal 15 
OFF). The DME is signaled to acti¬ 
vate the electric water pump via the 
bus system to circulate the coolant. 


Switch-on Conditions: 

• Terminal 15 OFF 
And 

• Run-down period active (up to 15 minutes after terminal 15 OFF) 
And 

• REST button in IHKA controls ON 
And 

• Ambient temperature below 25°C 
And 

• Engine temperature at some point above 60°C 
And 

• On-board supply voltage over 11.4 volts 

Conditions for Switching Off: 

• Terminal 15 ON 
Or 

• Residual heat ON (15 minutes) expired 
Or 

• REST button in IHKA control panel OFF 
Or 

• OFF condition activated with residual heat active (terminal R) 
Or 

• Prompt from power management to switch off auxiliary 
consumers 

Or 

• On-board supply voltage less than 11 volts 





Defrost Function 

When the defrost function is activated, the defroster flap (on the 
inside in front of the windshield) is opened fully. The fresh-air/air-re¬ 
circulation flaps move to the fresh air position. 

All other flaps are closed. The blower is run up to maximum output. 

AUTO Function 

When this button is pressed, all IHKA functions are set to automat¬ 
ic mode. If one or more automatically controlled functions are man¬ 
ually set, automatic control for the functions concerned will be can¬ 
celled. 


Note: All other functions remain automatically controlled. 


Heated Rear Window 

The heated rear window is switched on when the button in the 
IHKA control panel is pressed. The function indicator lamp in the 
button lights up. 

The heated rear window is switched off by pressing the button 
again or automatically after the heating time has expired. 


Defrosting Phase (1st heating period) 

When terminal 15 is switched ON, the first time the system is 
switched on, the time span for the heated rear window is defined 
as follows: 

• Ambient temperature down to -15°C: Heating period: 

10 minutes 

• Ambient temperature below 15°C: Heating period: 

17 minute 

Pulsing 

After the defrosting phase, the heating phase (25 minutes with 
pulsed heat output (on-off cycle: 40 seconds ON, 80 seconds 
OFF). The function indicator lamp in the button is off during puls¬ 
ing. reversed step-by-step in reverse order. 

2nd Heating Period 

After the 1 st heating period has expired, each subsequent time the 
button is pressed will cause the heated rear window to be switched 
on for a further 30 minutes (defrosting phase).Afterthe 2nd heating 
period has expired, output is again pulsed. 

OFF 

The IHKA control panel is switched off when the blower speed is 
set to 0. (The control panel/control unit continues to run in the 
background.) 

Air-recirculation Mode 

In air-recirculation mode, the flow of outside air can be stopped to 
prevent pollution from entering the vehicle, e.g. in traffic conges¬ 
tion. Air inside the vehicle is continually re-circulated. 

To make sure that there is a sufficient supply of fresh air, air-recircu¬ 
lation mode is only available for a limited time. (30 minutes air recir¬ 
culation -> 30 seconds partial fresh air -> 30 minutes air recircula¬ 
tion -> etc.) 


Climate Control Workbook 

103 



104 

Climate Control Workbook 


Automatic Air-recirculation Control 

If the AUC II sensor detects an increased level of pollutants in the 
environment from spark-ignition and diesel engines, the IHKA con¬ 
trol unit will automatically switch to air recirculation mode. 

To make sure there is still an adequate supply of fresh air, air recir¬ 
culation is only available for a limited time: 

• At ambient temperatures less than 0°C: 2 minute re-circulated 
air mode -> 20 seconds fresh air mode -> 2 minute re-circu- 
lated air mode -> etc. 

• At ambient temperatures from 0°C to 6°C: 3 minute re-circu¬ 
lated air mode -> 20 seconds fresh air mode -> 3 minute re¬ 
circulated air mode -> etc. 

• Operation without a/c function at ambient temperatures 
greater than 6°C: 4 minute re-circulated air mode -> 20 sec¬ 
onds fresh air mode -> 4 minute re-circulated air mode -> etc. 

• Operation with a/c function at ambient temperatures greater 
than 6°C: 12 minute re-circulated air mode -> 20 seconds 
fresh air mode -> 12 minute re-circulated air mode -> etc. 

When the engine is started and the AUC function activated, fresh- 
air mode is always selected for about. 40 seconds due to the 
warming phase of the AUC sensor. 


Condensation Sensor Program 

The following conditions must be satisfied for the condensation 
sensor to operate: 

• The engine must be running 

• The IHKA must be in automatic mode 

The IHKA control unit evaluates the condensation sensor signal 
(humidity). If condensation on the windshield is imminent, the fol¬ 
lowing measures are initiated in sequence to prevent condensation 
from forming: 

• Open defrost flaps further 

• Switch from air-recirculation/AUC/automatic air-recirculation 
mode to partial fresh-air mode 

• Switch from partially fresh air in air-recirculation/AUC/automatic 
air-recirculation mode to fresh air 

• Increase blower air volume 

• Reduce air volume for the footwell 

• Increase desired temperature value 

If one measure proves to be ineffective, the next measure is initiat¬ 
ed. Once successful, the measures previously performed are 
reversed step-by-step in reverse order. 



Convertible Mode (E93) 

The E93 Convertible with its retractable hardtop combines two 
vehicles in one. It is a Coupe when closed and a Convertible when 
open, a fact taken into account by the automatic climate control to 
create pleasant and comfortable heating/ventilation conditions. 

This characteristic makes it possible for an individual climate con¬ 
trol program for both states. The software automatically initiates 
the automatic climate control program when it detects that the 
hardtop is down. 

Trials and customer surveys have shown that the previous air con¬ 
ditioning systems set up for Sedans or Coupes were not ideal for a 
Convertible with the top down. 

The temperature and blower output stage had to be constantly 
readjusted for the purpose of ensuring pleasant interior conditions. 

All control parameters are adapted to the requirements of driving 
with the top down when the hardtop is lowered. 

Convertible mode requires no additional sensors. The IHKA con¬ 
trol unit was programmed with corresponding software that takes 
these specific parameters into account. 

Convertible mode is activated by opening the retractable hardtop. 
The IHKA receives the corresponding information on the status of 
the hardtop from the Convertible top module (CTM). 


Note: The E64 was also equipped with a convertible 
mode for the Climate Control. 


Convertible mode is always active on vehicles with no central infor¬ 
mation display (CID). On vehicles with central information display, 
the Convertible Mode box in the "Automatic Program" menu must 
first be activated. 

This activation is possibly only with the hardtop open and is set to 
active as part of initial programming.

Condition Based Service 

Fresh Air/Recirculating Air Filters 

The E9X is equipped with a carbon activated microfilter which is 
accessible from the engine compartment. 


i) 



1. E90 Microfilter 


Fresh air is drawn in via two filter elements in the intake area in front 
of the bulkhead. The recirculated air is drawn in at the side by the 
blower via separate recirculating air filters. 

Fresh Air Filtering 

A particulate filter or a micro/activated charcoal "combination filter" 
is also used on the E70 fresh air intake. The particulate filter (also 
referred to as a microfilter) removes dust, pollen, soot and other dirt 
from the fresh air that is needed to control the climate of the vehi¬ 
cle. 

The adsorption filter (activated charcoal filter) has the job of remov¬ 
ing the pollutants (hydrocarbons, acidic gasses) that mainly occur in 
high concentrations under smog conditions from the fresh air used 
the vehicle’s IHKA system. 

Recirculated Air Filtering 

A new type of honeycomb filter is used in the recirculated air intake. 


The versions for fresh air particulate filters can also be used for fil¬ 
tering recirculated air, but are used for cleaning the air in the pas¬ 
senger compartment. 

Filter types and equipment in the E70. All filters are electrostatically 
charged during manufacture and have the characteristic of attract¬ 
ing particles and holding them in, therefore cleaning the air. 

The performance figures of an adsorption filter are initial pressure 
loss, particle separation, dust storage capacity, gas adsorption 
(such as n-butanes, sulphur dioxide, toluene) and are independent 
of the filter surface and the air-mass flow. 

In order to be able to cope with customer specific filter usage and 
associated change interval increases and reductions, the filter 
change intervals of the E70 have not been stored in the CBS 
(Condition Based Service) system. 


Note: The filter change intervals can be found in the 
relevant service literature.
