BMW Apps/ConnectedDrive 

1. Introduction 

1.1. BMW Apps 

Apps, or "applications", have been developed for smartphones such as the Apple™ iPhone™ for some 
time now. These apps (or applications) are user programs and are available to download from the In¬ 
ternet either for free or for a charge, (for example from the Apple™ iTunes™ store). Once downloaded, 
the data installs itself on the smartphone. If a smartphone is connected to the vehicle, the software re¬ 
mains on the smartphone and is not transferred to the vehicle. This allows new functions to be devel¬ 
oped much more quickly. Therefore development costs are low and not dependent on the life cycle of 
the vehicles and their hardware (headunits, telephone control units, etc.). 

As from December 2010, customers can download the BMW Connected App from the Apple 
™iTunes™ Store and install it on their iPhone™. The original Apple™ USB cable is used to connect 
the smartphone to the vehicle. Additional functions are available to the customer once the smartphone 
has been connected to the vehicle using the specially developed snap-in adapter. No other smart¬ 
phones or operating systems Apps are currently supported by the BMW App. 





BMW Connected in Apple iTunes™ portal 


1.2. Video playback 

When MTV™ broadcasted the video clip “Video Killed The Radio Star" on August 1 st, 1981, this her¬ 
alded the era of the video clip. “YouTube™ launched an Internet video portal on February 14th, 2005 
where the user can view and upload video clips free of charge. The Internet site contains film and TV 
clips, music videos and self-made films. Since 2007, BMW Group has expanded its Internet presence 
with the site www.bmw.tv where video clips are available to the public (See BMW TV App). The files 
can be downloaded from there in wmv or mp4 format.

BMW Apps/ConnectedDrive 

1. Introduction 


Video clips are therefore now part of our everyday life and now they can also be played in BMW vehi¬ 
cles. To achieve this, a video connection between the vehicle and the Apple™ iPhone™ has been de¬ 
veloped in order to be able to play the video clips from the smartphone on the vehicle's CID. 


1.3. Plugin 

Smartphones are assuming more and more importance among consumers. This is why BMW Group 
made the decision to support the connection of these devices and their software (referred to as apps) 
to the vehicle electrical system. The Plugin feature allows the user to switch from the familiar BMW us¬ 
er interface (iDrive controller in conjunction with the Central Information Display) to the traditional Ap¬ 
ple™ interface. The Plugin feature essentially supports the iPod™ function of the iPhone™. 


1.4. ConnectedDrive 

BMW Assist intelligently integrates the driver, the vehicle and the environment as part of BMW's global 
ConnectedDrive initiative. Combining GPS location technology with hands-free wireless communica¬ 
tion BMW Assist connects you to a response specialist for help with almost everything, from an emer¬ 
gency situation to directions and traffic information. On suitably equipped 2007 and later models, the 
BMW Assist Safety Plan is part of Ultimate Service (included currently at no cost for 4 years from your 
BMW's in-service date). Your BMW Assist system also includes Bluetooth® hands-free calling capa¬ 
bility with speech recognition. 

The innovative services that come with BMW Assist ensure more safety, comfort and Infotainment op¬ 
tions in BMW vehicles. For example: The introduction of the first fully-fledged iPod interface in the ve¬ 
hicle and Head-Up Display in 2008. The implementation of the remote functions which enabled cus¬ 
tomers for the first time unlock the vehicle via a service provider. The implementation of BMW Search 
which allows online access to the latest weather forecasts, and delivers DOW, NASDAQ and S&P 500 
stock indices from Bloomberg to the iDrive display right inside your vehicle. Customers can access 
news headlines covering US, world, sports, business and BMW topics directly with the text-to-speech 
function available on 2010 and later models.

3.3.3. Video switch 

Due to the many optional extras offered in BMW FOx model vehicles, all the Color Video Blanking Sig¬ 
nal (CVBS) inputs in the CIC/headunit are occupied, thus the addition of a video switch is required in 
these vehicles in order to handle all CVBS signals. In the F25 however the video switch has been omit¬ 
ted. In this case an item of optional equipment has to be omitted due to the optional equipment control 
(DVD changer, camera module for the rear view camera w/ top view or video connection via SA 6NR).

Headunit 


The headunit and CID are connected via a Low Voltage Differential Signalling (LVDS) line. In this case, 
the analogue video signals in the headunit (e.g. CVBS) are converted into the LVDS digital video signal. 


4.2. Controller 

The familiar BMW operating concept used up until now can be adapted to the Apple™ philosophy by 
navigating with the controller to the "Plugin" submenu of the ConnectedDrive menu. For more infor¬ 
mation on this, refer to the “ConnectedDrive” chapter. The connection of the controller to the vehicle 
electrical system is the same as vehicles not equipped with SA 6NR Apps. 


4.3. Smartphone Integration (BMW Apps SA 6NR) 

Audio playback via an external device (e.g. iPod, USB stick) is already possible due to the way in which 
components of the optional equipment Smartphone Integration (SA 6NF) have been integrated into 
the vehicle system. Video playback is now available in combination with BMW Apps (SA 6NR). This 
is currently only available for the Apple™ iPhone™ and is made possible by placing the smartphone in 
the specially development “Media” snap-in adapter. 

A_ 

The Apple™ iPhone™ is the first smartphone for which a suitable BMW snap-in adapter has 
been developed. Currently there are several snap in adapters available from BMW for the Ap¬ 
ple™ iPhone™ depending on vehicle model year, equipment option, available features and de¬ 
vice version. When addressing a customer complaint please verify that you are using the cor¬ 
rect snap in adapter for that application. 


17 













BMW Apps/ConnectedDrive 

4. System components 


The signals that transmit the sounds and images in the video files follow different paths in the vehicle. 
The image data is sent from the smartphone to the headunit in the form of an analogue Color Video 
Blanking Signal (CVBS) via the video base plate, snap-in adapter and wiring harness. They are con¬ 
verted to a digital low voltage differential signal (LVDS) in the headunit and displayed at the CID. 

The audio signals are sent to the Combox via an AF (audio frequency) signal, then also transmitted to 
the headunit via the Media Oriented System Transport (MOST) bus from where they are then sent to 
the speakers via the HiFi or Top-Hifi amplifier.

4.3.1. “Media” snap-in adapter 

A description of the redesigned “Media” snap-in adapter is provided below. This can be ordered via 
the Electronic Parts Catalogue for the iPhone™ 3G/3GS and the iPhone™ 4. Two panels on top of the 
adapter have been colored silver so it can be clearly differentiated from its predecessor.

4. System components 

This modified snap-in adapter contains a chip that converts the video signal from the iPhone™ (1 wire 
+ ground) into a differential video signal (CVBS) (2 wires + ground). It also contains resistors that adjust 
the level to 75 ohm. The conversion to 2 wires + ground is made because when a fault occurs with dif¬ 
ferential transmission this occurs on both wires. As the signal is mirrored, the sum of the signal is al¬ 
ways 0 and the fault is therefore absorbed or canceled out. The quality and interference immunity of 
the video transmission via the “Video ready” snap-in adapter is therefore significantly higher.

The cell phone must not be exposed to extreme ambient conditions. At high temperatures, 
functions such as charging can no longer be carried out. In some cases where Web Radio or 
other UMTS data services are continuously used, the iPhone™ can heat up to the point that it 
can lead to deactivation of the charging process at ambient temperatures as low as 23°C/73° 
F. To address this a media snap-in adapter with an integrated fan has been developed part # 
84 21 2 218 390 for iPhone™ 4 and # 84 21 2 218 391 for 3g/3gs. Please refer to the latest af¬ 
tersales parts bulletin for more information.

4.3.2. Video base plate 

The newly developed video base plate enables the vehicle to access the video data saved on the 
smartphone. The audio signal of the video clip is connected to the Combox via the video base plate 
(SA6 NF) and iPod and USB adapter (SA 6FL) in the center console. The video signal is transferred to 
the headunit directly via the CVBS signal described above and via the interface of the video base plate. 


In terms of its appearance when installed, the video base plate is no different to the base plate that 
"only" supports audio playback. In order to find out whether a video base plate is installed, the black 
18-pin connector must be removed and the pinning checked.

The relevant connection between the video base plate and the vehicle electrical system is explained in 
the following graphic:

The control signals for the App (SA 6NR) are transmitted via a 4-core USB data line. The distinguish¬ 
ing feature of the specially developed base plate for extended connectivity of the music player in the 
cell phone is its two gold-plated pins. 

The gold-plated pins also serve as locking pins for the snap-in adapter. The video lines that transmit 
the CVBS signal are located in the 18-pin multi-pin connector. This distinguishes the video base plate 
from the USB base plate used up until now.

Be careful when installing the snap in adapter on the base plate as the small pins may be dam¬ 
aged if it is inserted incorrectly and forced in. 


4.4. Combox 

The Combox control unit is installed in the vehicle as a "Combox Telematics" telephone control unit 
and is only available in combination with BMW Assist. In addition to the general telephone functions, 
the Combox supports Office functions such as the calendar, text messages, email and the new BMW 
Apps. For more information on the Combox refer to the Combox training material ST1005 available on

If the Combox, headunit (CIC) with CID and controller as well as the newly developed video base plate 
are installed, the customer can order the optional equipment SA 6NR "BMW Apps". This will include 
the "Video Playback" and "Plugin" functions. The interaction of the components is highlighted in the 
following chapters. 


5.1. BMW Apps 

With BMW Apps (SA 6NR) the Apple™ iPhone™ " Apps" function is now available for the first time 
to BMW customers. These features are activated and controlled via the BMW iDrive user interface. An 
important point to note is that the software for the individual app is only installed on the iPhone™ and 
not in the headunit or Combox telephone control unit. The headunit is only required to integrate the 
functions in the vehicle. This means that problem-free functionality of the app depends on the app de¬ 
veloper and the stability of the iPhone's operating system. With the incorporation of BMW apps, the 
menu structure of the iDrive system was modified. The menu item "BMW Assist" in the main menu 
screen was changed to "ConnectedDrive".

Start button for "Facebook™" social network 


The BMW customer can now also access his/her Facebook™ social network in the vehicle with the as¬ 
sistance of BMW Apps. This means the customer can also keep in touch with the contacts in his/her 
social network for the duration of the trip. The user can let the members of his social network know 
about what he/she is currently experiencing: e.g. "I need a filling station fast!". This feature also in¬ 
cludes other pre-prepared messages which are randomly generated by the system. It is also possible 
for users to create their own messages and then post them on the spot. Furthermore, the customer 
can also learn about the status of other members of the social network or read their messages. Mes¬ 
sages can be "read out” with the voice command system option SA 620 (which is included with SA 
609) while the vehicle is moving. This means that the driver can "check" messages without taking his/ 
her eyes off the road. Note that the voice system (Text to Speech) only reads out the message in the 
language set in the headunit. For example: If the language is set to Spanish the speech processing 
system may therefore attempt to read out English text modules in Spanish.

5.1.3. Web radio 

The driver of a BMW vehicle that is networked with the outside world via the "Web radio" BMW App 
can receive the signal of his/her favorite radio station worldwide. Prerequisites for this process (known 
as "live streaming") are that the program must be listed in the database of broadcast stations and the 
relevant streaming format must be supported. 

Once the app has been successfully activated, the customer can navigate to the "Web radio" sub¬ 
menu in the Radio menu, and add to several preset "BMW Top stations" by searching for radio stations 
worldwide based on selection criteria such as location, genre and local radio stations.

When the iPhone™ is used extensively (e.g. while using the Web radio) the iPhone's charg¬ 
ing circuit may be deactivated if its temperature exceeds 40°C/104° F on iPhone™ 3G/S or 
46°C/115° F on the iPhone™ 4. To address this issue a media snap-in adapter with an inte¬ 
grated fan has been developed, part # 84 21 2 218 390 for iPhone™ 4 and # 84 21 2 218 391 
for 3G/3GS. Please refer to the latest Aftersales parts bulletin for more information. 


5.1.4. Last Mile & Vehicle Finder 

The Last Mile function was added to the list of BMW Apps in the spring of 2011 and it is available for 
download from the iTunes Portal™ as a “BMW Apps" software update. The Last Mile app guides the 
customer to his actual navigation destination, even if this in a location that is inaccessible to motor ve¬ 
hicles (e.g. pedestrian zone or city parking garage). Navigation continues after the customer has left 
the vehicle and uses the iPhone™ as a navigation tool.

Last Mile function in iPhone™ 


Once the customer has left the vehicle, the coordinates of the vehicle's location are transmitted to 
the iPhone™. It is important in this case to ensure that the Last Mile function is activated before exit¬ 
ing the vehicle. The last destination, next destination and final destination are also transmitted to the 
iPhone™. The last destination is useful in cases where the customer is unable to park at the actual 
destination, heads for the next multi-story parking lot and walks back to the previous destination (e.g. 
museum, theater, restaurant, etc.). The next and final destination become active if the customer has 
entered several destinations in the BMW navigation system route guidance.

5.2. Smartphone Integration (Audio/Video Interface) 


5.2.1. Video playback 

The new "video base plate" makes it possible to play video clips in BMW vehicles. For safety reasons, 
this function is only supported when the vehicle is stationary. The video clips are displayed in the Cen¬ 
tral Information Display (CID) only, and not on the rear entertainment displays. The video signal is sent 
to the headunit from the iPhone™ via the “Media” snap-in adapter and base plate (see Chapter 4.3). 
Videos can be selected and played from the "CD/Multimedia - External audio devices" menu and the 
"ConnectedDrive-Plugin" menu.

5.3. Plugin 

The Plugin menu item allows the customer to create the look and feel of an Apple™ device when the 
iPhone™ is connected to the vehicle via the snap in adapter. The control signals in this case are trans¬ 
mitted through USB connection. The picture signals are rendered by the iPhone™ in the familiar optics 
used in the pervious iPod™ and output as video signal via a CVBS connection to the headunit. 

A 

The iPhone™ must be connected via the “Media” snap in adapter in order to display videos 
or operate the Plugin feature. When addressing a customer complaint please make sure that 
the correct snap in adapter is being used. For more information refer to section 4.31 “Media” 
snap-in adapter.

5.3.1. Starting Plugin 

Before starting the Plugin feature make sure that the iPhone™ is connected via the “Media” snap in 
adapter in the center console. Once Plugin has been selected, the connection between the iPhone™ 
and the vehicle is checked. Select the “Plugin” button to start the function. In doing so, it is important 
to be aware that when the function is started, the usual BMW iDrive “turn-press-push" environment 
no longer applies. Although the push function no longer exists the user navigates through the menu by 
turning and pressing the controller and can still jump back one step via the “Back” button. Press the 
"Menu" button to exit the Plugin function and return to the main menu of the BMW iDrive system.

5.3.2. Genius music mixes 

To give the customer an added benefit, iPhone™ Genius mixes can now also be accessed. Genius 
mixes browses the iTunes™ Media Library on the iPhone™ and automatically generates up to twelve 
genre-based mixes containing tracks that (according to the Apple™ Genius) "work well together". It is 
not possible to influence the selection directly. These mixes are compiled based on the experience of 
the worldwide iTunes™ community. The playlist generated by Genius can be saved on the iPhone™ or 
updated from time to time.

6. Self-diagnosis 

The ’’BMW Connected” app on the iPhone™ includes a self-diagnosis function which can be used for 
troubleshooting in order to eliminate faults more quickly and systematically. If the BMW Connected 
app is not working properly, the customer can start the "self-diagnosis" via his/her iPhone™. In doing 
so, the iPhone™ must not initially be connected to the vehicle via the USB port. Once the self-diag¬ 
nosis has been started, the customer will be prompted to connect the iPhone™ to the vehicle via the 
USB cable. Once the self-diagnosis has been completed, a nine-digit fault code is displayed for the 
customer. 



BMW iPhone™ App Self-diagnosis code retrieval. 


The customer can then quote that code to the Service department. Alternatively, the Service employ¬ 
ee will need to start the self-diagnosis via the customer's iPhone™ then note down the fault code. 
Once the self-diagnosis is complete, the customer can take the iPhone™ with him/her, even if the 
vehicle has to remain in the workshop because the fault has not yet been eliminated. The test plan 
AT8400_A4A can be called up on ISTA or ISTA Client. The test plan prompts you to enter the iPhone 
diagnostic code. By entering the fault code in the diagnosis system, the fault can be traced back to the 
iPhone™, vehicle or connection (snap-in adapter) between the device and vehicle.

BMW Apps/ConnectedDrive 

6. Self-diagnosis 



Diagnosis system - input of fault code and display of iPhone™ details 

Faults that are attributable to the iPhone™ will not be repaired by BMW Service and must be remedied 
by the manufacturer of the device or relevant app provider. 

In order to trace faults on the vehicle, the service employee must perform a short test and run the 
telecommunication test plan (AT8400_SYSTEL). The relevant test module for evaluating the test code 
is integrated in this plan (A4A - Application 4 Automotive). The test code is decoded by the test plan. 
This provides the service employee with all of the necessary information. He is then able to perform a 
focussed diagnosis. 

The test code can also be evaluated on a workshop computer (e.g. service advisor's computer). A 
functional ISTA client must be installed on this computer. The vehicle can be identified via the chas¬ 
sis number or its basic characteristics using the ISTA Client. Then a free test search can be made for 
the test module AT8400_A4A - Test code evaluation for service advisors in order to run the module. 
The test module can also be found at: Information search - Functional structure - Body - Audio, Video, 
Telephone, Navigation - Telecommunication - Documents - BMW Connected. This test module is only 
intended to be a source of information for service advisors and does not generate a diagnosis code. If a 
diagnosis code is needed, proceed as described in section Dealing with problems in the workshop.
