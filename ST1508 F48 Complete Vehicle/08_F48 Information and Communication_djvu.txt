F48 Information and Communication 

1. Introduction 


This section is intended to provide an overview of the information and communication systems 
used in the F48. 

With the new Headunit, the F48 reaches another milestone in the area of multimedia technology.

The F48 does not have a DVD changer. The USB interface is already included in the basic equipment 
independent of the headunit. 


2.2. Media System 

The F48 receives a completely redeveloped headunit. The manufacturer of this headunit is Magneti- 
Marelli. 

The Media System receives a CD drive as standard equipment (SA 650).

The customer has the option of ordering two navigation systems. The optional equipment Navigation 
(SA 6UN) and the optional equipment Navigation Plus (SA 6UP). The headunit is identical for the two 
equipment specifications. With the optional equipment Navigation Plus (SA 6UP), the F48 receives 
additional equipment, for example a touch controller and 8.8" central information display, as well as a 
Head-Up Display.

The basic structure of the hardware of both Headunit devices is the same. In contrast to the media 
system, the navigation systems are equipped with an antenna connection for the navigation antenna. 
All components for navigation are also located therein. With the exception of the yaw sensor, which 
in the F48 is housed in the Advanced Crash Safety Module (ACSM) and transfers the data to the 
headunit via a bus signal. 

A larger flash memory with 32 GB, instead of the 4 GB with the media system, is installed for the 
navigation systems. The permanent storage of the map data is a reason for this.

3. Speaker Systems 


3.1. Overview 

The speaker systems in the F48 are available in three specification levels: 

• Hi-fi system (SA 676) 

• Harman Kardon® hi-fi system (SA 674) 


3.2. Components 


3.2.1. Hi-fi system 

The hi-fi system in the F48 is standard equipment (SA 676). The hi-fi system comprises 7 speakers, 
with an overall power of 205 Watt. 

The amplifier of the hi-fi system is not connected to any bus system.

3.2.2. Hi-fi system Harman Kardon® 

The Harman Kardon hi-fi system (SA 674) consists of twelve speakers. Separate speakers are 
installed in the Harman Kardon® hi-fi system for the tweeter and mid-tone ranges. A seven-channel 
amplifier with a digital equalizer is integrated in the Harman Kardon® hi-fi system. The amplifier is a 
bus slave in the K-CAN4. 

The mid-range speakers and tweeters of the Harman Kardon hi-fi system have high-quality 
aluminium membranes for a clearly differentiated sound pattern. Thanks to the additional use of 
hexagonally structured metal covers, the damping and resonances of the covers are minimized. 

The speakers and the amplifier of the Harman Kardon® hi-fi system are illustrated in the following 
graphic. The speakers have an overall power of 360 Watt.

4. Telephone Systems 

4.1. Overview 

Two different items of optional equipment are available for the F48 telephone systems: 

• Hands-free system (already included in the standard equipment) 

• Convenient telephone system with extended smartphone connection (SA 6NS) 

These two equipment specifications are fully supported by the headunit, i.e. the Bluetooth module is 
already integrated in the headunit. In the F48, a Combox is no longer required as an interface box. 

A Telematic Communication Box (TCB) is installed for the emergency call or the ConnectedDrive 
services. Further information on the ConnectedDrive services can be found in the product information 
bulletin "Information and Communication System News 1/2014". 

A 

The specified range of functions is only available with BMW-recommended Bluetooth-capable mobile 
phones. For details, please visit: www.bmw.com/bluetooth

4.2. Hands-free system 

The headunit-supported hands-free system, including the Bluetooth audio streaming function, 
is already included in the standard equipment. 

In the standard equipment "hands-free system", the vehicle does not have a base plate, i.e. the mobile 
phone does not have a connection for the vehicle telephone antenna and cannot be charged via a 
snap-in adapter.

(SA 6NS) can be added afterwards upon customer request. The customer receives all functions and 
interfaces of the CBX-MEDIA, the hands-free mode via Bluetooth, the smartphone connection via the 
base plate and snap-in adapter and all additional functions such as Office, Cover Art and voice input. 
The features "Bluetooth audio streaming" and customer-initiated software update (KISU) are already 
available from the Bluetooth hands-free system.

6.1. Introduction 

Customers with Android smartphones and the Android operating system "Jelly Bean" 4.2.x. can 
download the BMW Connected app free of charge in the Google Play Store, depending on their mobile 
phone manufacturer. 



Android operating system "Jelly Bean" 4.2.2 


At present, not all Android smartphones are supported. 

Compatible smartphones can be found here: www.bmw.com/bluetooth. 

For Android telephones the selection of apps is not as extensive as for Apple telephones. The number 
of available apps is being increased continuously. With the software updates of the BMW Connected 
app, the customer receives new functions.

6.3. Function 

With an Android telephone there are two different options to play media in the vehicle: 

• USB mode 

• Accessory mode 

6.3.1. USB mode 

USB mode is comparable to the function of a mass storage device. If the Android smartphone is 
connected to the vehicle with a USB cable, then one can find the telephone under the "Multimedia" 
main menu under "External devices", similar to the connection of a mass storage device. A search can 
be performed for artists or genres. The headunit is the audio player in USB mode. The end device only 
supplies the audio data to the headunit. 


In the following table you see the most frequent transmission types of the various end devices.

6.3.2. Accessory mode 

If Accessory mode is activated, the mobile phone now becomes the source of audio. 

The BMW Connected app also has an audio player, in addition to apps such as Facebook, News, etc. 
This is visible in Accessory mode under CD/Multimedia and can play music data stored on the mobile 
phone (not music data stored on the additional memory card). The mobile phone of the customer is 
now the audio player, in contrast to the headunit (USB mode). This is necessary so that the customer 
does not always have to change to USB mode when he is working with the apps in order to listen to 
music on his smartphone.

Android smartphones are either connected to the vehicle via the snap-in adapter or a USB cable. 


A new snap-in adapter is available for many Android smartphones. The "Snap-in Adapter Connected 
Universal" is suitable for different mobile phones. The antenna is connected inductively via a coupling 
antenna without any contact. Further information on the snap-in adapter can be found in the product 
information bulletin "Information and Communication System News 1/2014".
