B46 Engine 
1. Introduction 


This document describes the special features of the new 4-cylinder engine and serves to support 
the technical service. Due to the huge similarities, between the B38 Top engine and B46, the two 
engines are described in this one document. Some images shown relate to the 3-cylinder engine. 

The differences compared to the 4-cylinder engine are shown and described separately. However, the 
similarities are not repeated. The engines are distinguished as follows in this document: 

• B38 = 3-cylinder engine 

• B46 = 4-cylinder engine 

• Bx8 = 3 and 4-cylinder engine 


1.1. Engine designation 

In the technical documentation, the engine designation is used to ensure unambiguous identification 
of the engine. Frequently, only a short designation is used, which is explained in the following table.

1. Introduction 

1.2. Engine identification 

The 7-digit engine identification is on the crankcase. The first six digits of the engine identification 
are derived from the engine type. Only the seventh digit is different. The seventh digit of the engine 
identification is the test number of the type approval certification. 

The consecutive engine number is embossed above the engine identification. Using these two 
numbers the engine can be clearly identified by the manufacturer.

B46 Engine 
1. Introduction 

This following drive and installation variants are available: 

• Transverse mounting 
Front-wheel drives 
Four-wheel drives 

• Automatic transmission 

1.3.2. Advantages 

Benefits due to lower number of cylinders: 

• less weight 

• fewer moving masses 

• less spatial requirement 

• reduction of internal engine friction 

The B46 engine is based on the familiar N20 engine. The familiar TVDI 1 technology is used in all new 
engines. An offset or axial offset, as used in the N20 engine, is not used with the new B46 engine. 

The new engine generation is mainly characterized by lower fuel consumption and fewer exhaust 
emissions (ULEV II). To achieve low fuel consumption, a map-controlled oil pump, characteristic map 
thermostat and injection system with direct-rail and electric arc wire-sprayed cylinder barrels, among 
others, are used. All engines also receive an automatic engine start-stop function and intelligent 
alternator control as a further EfficientDynamics measure. 

^VDI technology consists of: 

• T = Turbocharger 

• V = Valvetronic 

• Dl = Direct-Injection (direct fuel injection)

1.4. Modular design 

The EfficientDynamics strategy of the N engine generation has resulted in a large number of different 
technologies finding their way into the BMW engine world. The strategy for the simplification of 
inspection work is also pursued with the B engine generation.

The modular strategy aims for different effects throughout the product development process and 
product life cycle. This allows development and manufacturing costs, for example, to be lowered by 
using uniform processes. In production, the complexity of the manufacturing process planning and 
implementation is reduced. In Service, the warehousing is simplified as a result of the reduction of part 
variety, and the safe handling of products is increased.

B46 Engine 
1. Introduction 


The graphic shows a 4-cylinder in-line engine with a firing interval of 180° and a firing order of 1-3-4- 
2. One crankshaft revolution (360°) results in two work cycles for the 4-cylinder in-line engine. 

The acoustic differences therefore have their origin in the different firing intervals.

1.6.2. Active Sound Design 

The acoustics of the engine can be adapted using the hi-fi system. With the help of the audio system 
installed in the vehicle, the vehicle sound pattern is supported by the use of the Active Sound 
Design. The sound pattern is achieved with the reinforcement of the acoustic components, which are 
generated by the engine. 

The following graphic provides a system overview.

B46 Engine 
1. Introduction 


The Digital Motor Electronics (DME) engine control unit sends information about the engine speed 
and load via the PT-CAN to the Body Domain Controller (BDC). The Body Domain Controller (BDC) 
transmits this information from the PT-CAN to the K-CAN/K-CAN2. Via the K-CAN/K-CAN2 the 
information reaches the Active Sound Design (ASD) control unit. The Active Sound Design (ASD) 
control unit generates an audio signal with this information. This audio signal is modulated to the audio 
signal of the headunit and forwarded to the loudspeakers. An engine sound corresponding to the 
driving condition is output to the driver via the speaker. 

A 

The Active Sound Design (ASD) can be muted up to the next terminal change via the ISTA diagnosis 
system. It is not possible to deactivate the Active Sound Design permanently.

Bayonet fitting with retaining clips 


As is the case with the existing N20 engine, the B46 engine also has a recess for mounting the VANOS 
solenoid valve actuators in the cylinder head cover. In contrast to the N20 engine, the VANOS solenoid 
valve actuators are not screwed on, and instead are fastened using a bayonet fitting and retaining clips. 

Tasks of crankcase ventilation: 

• Regulation of the internal engine pressure. 

• Cleaning the blow-by gases to remove engine oil. 

• Recirculation of the cleaned blow-by gases in the intake area. 

When the engine is in operation, gases (referred to as "blow-by gases") from the combustion chamber 
pass through the cylinder walls and enter the crankcase. These blow-by gases contain unburned fuel 
and all elements of the exhaust gas. In the crankcase they are mixed with engine oil which is available 
there in the form of oil mist. 

The volume of the blow-by gases is dependent on the engine speed and the load. Without crankcase 
ventilation excess pressure would arise in the crankcase. This excess pressure would be present in all 
cavities connected to the crankcase (e.g. oil return duct, chain shaft, etc.) and lead to oil leakage at the 
seals. 

The crankcase ventilation prevents this. It routes the extensively engine oil-free blow-by gases to 
the clean air pipe and the separated droplets of oil flow back to the oil sump via an oil return pipe. 

In addition, the crankcase ventilation, in combination with a pressure control valve, ensures a low 
vacuum in the crankcase.

The crankcase ventilation in B46 engine has a two-stage design. This means that, depending on the

Naturally aspirated engine operation 

During naturally-aspirated engine operation, the blow-by gases upstream of the intake valves are 
routed to the intake port.

The fine oil mist is separated from the blow-by gases with the assistance of a separator and the oil 
droplets formed are routed back to the oil sump via the oil return. 

The throttle valve is closed during naturally-aspirated engine operation. This produces a vacuum in 
the intake system, which draws in the blow-by gases via blow-by channels cast into the cylinder head 
directly upstream of the intake valves. In systems controlled by Valvetronic, the throttle valve is also 
lightly shut in these operating conditions to guarantee the engine ventilation function. 

A purge air line, which is connected to the clean air pipe ahead of the exhaust turbocharger and to the 
crankcase, routes fresh air via a non-return valve directly into the crankcase chamber. The bigger the 
vacuum in the crankcase, the bigger the air mass introduced into the crankcase. This purging prevents 
the pressure control valve from icing up. 

Charged operation 

As a significant overpressure prevails in the intake pipe during turbocharged operation, the blow-by 
gases cannot be introduced upstream of the intake valves in the intake port. The blow-by gases are 
therefore introduced into the clean air pipe in this operating condition.

The fine oil mist is separated from the blow-by gases with the assistance of a separator and the oil 
droplets formed are routed back to the oil sump via the oil return. 

The cylinder head cover is connected to the clean air pipe by a hose. During turbocharged operation, 
a vacuum is produced in the clean air pipe. This vacuum draws the blow-by gases into the clean air 
pipe via the hose. 

A 


Always ensure absolute cleanliness when filling the engine with engine oil. Clean the oil filler neck 
before you screw on the sealing cap. Engine oil residue at the sealing cap may lead to misdiagnosis 
at the crankcase ventilation.

Cooling concept of cylinder head 

The B46 engine has a cylinder head with cross-flow cooling. In the case of cross-flow cooling, the 
coolant flows from the hot exhaust side to the cooler intake side. This has the advantage of providing 
uniform heat distribution in the overall cylinder head. Loss of pressure in the cooling circuit is also 
prevented. 

Cylinder head gasket 

In order to satisfy the high demands of the B46 engine, a triple-layer spring steel gasket is used as the 
cylinder head gasket.

Electric arc wire spraying (LDS) 



Electric arc wire spraying method, Bx8 engine 


The cylinder barrels of the B46 engine are coated by means of an electric arc wire spraying process. 

In this procedure a conductive metal wire is heated until it melts. The melt is then sprayed onto the 
cylinder barrels at high pressure. This layer of ferrous material is roughly 0.3 mm thick, extremely wear- 
resistant and facilitates an efficient transfer of heat from the combustion chambers to the crankcase, 
and from there to the coolant ducts. 

Advantages: 

• Lower weight 

• High wear resistance 

• Good heat dissipation to the crankcase 

• Lower internal engine friction thanks to excellent sliding properties 


A _ 

Due to the thin material application during the electric arc wire-spraying procedure, subsequent 
processing of the cylinder barrels is not possible.

Deep Skirt 

With the "deep skirt" concept, the side walls extend far downwards. This lends the crankcase a high 
degree of stability and considerable flexibility in terms of the piston stroke length. 

Embossed crankshaft bearing cap 

The weight of the main bearing cap of the crankshaft has been further optimized for the new B46 
engine. When the impression connection is made the main bearing cap is designed with a profile. 
When the main bearing bolts are tightened for the first time, this profile pushes into the surface of 
the bearing block on the crankcase side. 

A_ 

Exchange of the main bearing cap, or positioning in another bearing position on the crankshaft, 
is not permitted and will lead to engine damage. 


Ventilation holes 

The combustion chambers are connected via ventilation bore holes at the bottom end of the cylinder 
barrels. The air flows, which arise as a result of the upward and downward movement of the pistons, 
can thus escape easier via the ventilation bore holes. In addition, as the displacement of air volume has 
been simplified by using the ventilation bore holes, the piston can move up and down more easily. 

This reduces the internal friction of the engine and ensures the engine operates more efficiently. 


2.1.4. Oil sump 

The oil sump is manufactured from die-cast aluminium. 

Tasks: 


• Collecting vessel for engine oil. 

• Collection area for returning engine oil. 

• Reinforcing component in the engine-transmission combination. 

• Fixture for the oil-level sensor and oil drain plug. 

• Connection of the anti-roll bar link for transverse mounting.

Overview of bearing shells at the B38 engine 


The crankshaft is mounted using different bearing shells. The bearing shells in the low-load zone of 
the bearing seat have oil holes and a peripheral groove for fresh oil supply. The highly stressed bearing 
shells in the area of the main bearing cap have no oil holes or grooves.

A 

Due to the very low tolerances, special attention must be paid to cleanliness when handling bearing 
shells. 


The axial guide bearing is located in the center bearing area of the crankshaft. This bearing holds the 
crankshaft in the axial direction and must absorb forces in the longitudinal direction which, for example, 
can arise during the operation the clutch. 

A_ 

Before the completion of the engine, check the side clearance in accordance with the repair 
instructions. Excessive side clearance may cause electrical faults or damage to the components. 


Identifying the bearing shells 

So that the crankshaft can carry out its main task effectively, incorporation of the lifting movement and 
conversion to a rotational movement, it must be positioned correctly. The dimension to be adjusted 
can also be called a fit and is generated using crankshaft bearing shells with varying degrees of 
thickness.

A distinction is made between three types of fit in the design:

B46 Engine

The fit is viewed as an accurate relationship between the bore hole and the shaft. The crankcase 
represents the bore hole and the crankshaft represents the shaft. This is why the numbers for the 
classification of the bearing shells are located on the crankcase and the crankshaft. In the case of a 
dimension being adjusted, this is a so-called clearance fit. A clearance fit is characterized by the fact 
that in each case the minimum dimension of the bore hole is greater than the maximum dimension of 
the shaft. This creates the necessary play between the shaft and the bore hole, which is needed for 
the bearing of the crankshaft.

The following letters are used for the classification: 

• A = highest possible play (thinnest bearing shell) 

• B = medium play (medium bearing shell) 

• C = lowest possible play (thickest bearing shell). 

The letter K stands for the transmission side of the crankcase. It also specifies the counting order for 
the assignment. 

If there is a K before the stamped letters, then the first letter of the code refers to the bearing shell of 
bearing seat 4, which is located on the transmission side. The subsequent letters, read from left to 
right, refer to the bearing seat 3, 2 and 1. The positions marked with "0" are placeholders for larger 
engines and are simply omitted. 

Using the previous graphic for reference, the following combination is obtained: 

Assignment: 

• Transmission side = K 

• Bearing seat 4 = C 

• Bearing seat 3 = B 

• Bearing seat 2 = B 

• Bearing seat 1 = A. 

If the stamped letters are not preceded by "K", then the first letter of the code refers to the bearing 
shell of bearing seat 1, which is located opposite the transmission side on the belt side. The 
subsequent letters, read from left to right, refer to bearing seat 2, 3 and 4. 

When assigning the letters without "K", the following combination is obtained: 

Assignment: 

• Bearing seat 1 = C 

• Bearing seat 2 = B 

• Bearing seat 3 = B 

• Bearing seat 4 = A.

In the case of the crankshaft, the letter K also defines the assignment of the bearing position. 

The digit next to the K is to be assigned to the main bearing cap 4 which is on the transmission side. 
The subsequent digits, read from left to right, refer to the main bearing cap 3, 2 and 1. 

Using the previous graphic for reference, the following combination is obtained:

If a connecting rod bearing cap is mounted the wrong way round or on another connecting rod, the 
fracture structure of both parts is destroyed and the connecting rod bearing cap is not centerd. In this 
event the entire connecting rod set must be replaced with new parts. In Service please observe the 
specified jointing torques and angle of rotation specifications in the repair instructions. 


Weight classification 

To guarantee smooth engine running, the connecting rods are divided into weight classes. The large 
and small connecting rod eyes are weighed separately and divided into various classes according to 
their weight. 

A _ _ _ 

In Service only connecting rods of the same weight class can be used. This is why only a full set of 
connecting rods is available in the event of a replacement. This set comprises the corresponding 
number of connecting rods of a weight classification. 


Irox-coating 

In order to comply with the increasingly stringent exhaust emission regulations, most combustion 
engines nowadays are equipped with an automatic engine start-stop function. This has led to a huge 
increase in starting cycles. 

To ensure the engine runs smoothly, it is important that sufficient lubricating oil is supplied to the 
bearing positions of the crankshaft. If the oil supply can be ensured, solid body contact will not 
occur between the connecting rod bearing journal and connecting rod bearing shell due to the thin 
lubricating film. 


41 













B46 Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 

If the engine is now stopped, it will not be possible for the mechanically-driven oil pump to maintain 
the oil supply. The oil film between the bearing positions flows off. Solid body contact occurs between 
the connecting rod bearing journal and connecting rod bearing shell. Once the engine is restarted, 
it takes a certain amount of time for the lubricating film to fully re-establish itself. The connecting 
rod bearing shell may be subject to wear in this short period. The Irox-coating reduces this wear to a 
minimum. 

The IROX-coated bearing shells are only located on the connecting rod side as here the load acts 
mainly on the bearing shells. The bearing shell caps are equipped with a bearing shell without IROX 
coating. 

The IROX ball bearings are red due to their special coating.

The Irox-coating is applied to a conventional bearing shell. It consists of a binding resin matrix made

in combination with the hard particles, that the bearing shell surface is so hard that material loss is 
no longer possible. The solid lubricants reduce surface friction and replace the oil film which briefly 
no longer exists between the bearing shell and the connecting rod bearing journal during the starting 
phase.

Piston 


To perform their functions, it is necessary for the piston rings to touch the cylinder wall and the edge 
of the piston groove. Contact with the cylinder wall is effected by the radially acting spring force of the 
ring. The oil scraper ring is supported by an additional ring. 

The piston rings rotate in the grooves while the engine is running and thereby alter the position of 
the gap. This stems from the lateral force which acts on the piston rings during change of contact. 
This process removes deposits from the ring grooves. It also prevents the piston ring gap from cutting 
into the cylinder barrel. 

The B46 engine has two compression rings and one oil scraper ring. 


44 



























B46 Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 

The plain rectangular compression ring sits in the first piston ring groove and is used as a plain 
compression ring. 

The taper faced piston ring is also a compression ring. A sharp wiper edge develops through the lug 
for controlling the oil supply. The undercut of the lug implies that the oil scraped from the running edge 
is diverted and an oil blockage does not form there, which would otherwise reduce the scraping effect. 

The oil scraper ring is a steel band ring with spring. The two lands and in particular the chamfer create 
a high surface contact pressure, which promotes the oil-scraping effect. 

A_ 

The plain rectangular compression ring and the taper faced piston ring have a Top mark. When 
installing the two piston rings the Top mark must be facing in the direction of the piston crown. 


2.2.4. Counterbalance shafts 

Due to the operating principle of the piston engine, undesired oscillations occur at the engine housing 
when driving, which can be transmitted to the vehicle interior. To counteract this negative effect, BMW 
has already been installing so-called counterbalance shafts in more recent engine generations. Up till 
now, their role was to cancel out free inertia forces and therefore increase ride comfort. In addition to 
the inertia forces, so-called 'free moments of inertia' also exist, which can also adversely effect ride 
comfort. Depending on the engine design and number of cylinders, varying degrees of free inertia 
forces and free moments of inertia occur.

The mass balance is used to offset structural imbalances. The task of the mass balance is to improve

Forces are invisible and can only be noticed by their effects. They consist of a point of action and an 
operating direction. Their state can be dynamic or static. The forces are shown as an arrow (vector). 
The arrowhead provides information on the operating direction of the force. At the other end of the 
arrow (vector), opposite the arrowhead, is the point of action. The intensity of the force is determined 
by the arrow length (vector length). The physical unit of force is [N] and the symbol is [F]. 

The previous graphic shows two forces acting in exactly opposite directions with the same intensity. 
The system is balanced (static) as both forces cancel each other. When observed from the outside, 
a reaction cannot be determined.

Torques occur if a force is transmitted at its point of action via a lever arm. The physical unit of torque 
is [Nm] and its symbol is [M]. The lever arm and the force acting at the point of action are decisive for 
the size of the torque. The following mathematical context emerges: 

• M = F ■ r 


The previous graphic shows two torques which cancel each other out. If the contact force is increased, 
without increasing the counterforce to the same degree, the two torques are no longer at equilibrium. 
The pendant would fall to the floor. To re-establish the static equilibrium of the system, either the 
counterforce has to be increased or the lever arm extended at which the counterforce acts.

Oscillating and rotating forces 

The upwards and downwards movement of the pistons, as well as the connecting rods, is called an 
oscillating force and the rotational movement of the crankshaft is called a rotating force. These two 
different forces also cause the undesired oscillations when the engine is running.

Oscillating forces occur in the piston engine when the direction changes at bottom and top dead 
center. Due to the inertia of the piston and the connecting rod, the force is directed either upwards or 
downwards. The following therefore applies: the lower the mass of the piston and the connecting rod, 
the lower the corresponding oscillating forces will be. 


48 











B46 Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 

In order to reduce the fuel consumption according to the EfficientDynamics strategy, the power output 
per liter is increased. Through the use of exhaust turbochargers more power is obtained from the 
same displacement. This means the pistons and the connecting rod are exposed to higher ignition 
pressures and must have a more solid design. The masses of the components subsequently increase, 
and thus the oscillating forces.

To produce a rotating movement of the crankshaft from the stroke of the piston, the connecting rod 
bearing journals that support the large connecting rod eye are not located on the axis of rotation of 
the crankshaft. An imbalance when turning the crankshaft occurs by the offset of the connecting rod 
bearing journals. The arising imbalance is counteracted by the use of counterweights.

The rotating inertia forces can be completely neutralized with help of the counterweights at the 
crankshaft. Some of the weight at the crankshaft is also used to reduce the oscillating inertia forces 
(change of direction of the piston and connecting rod). If the entire oscillating inertia forces are 
reduced by counterweights at the crankshaft, the forces or torques (depending on the design and 
number of cylinders) in the top and bottom dead center of the pistons are neutralized. However, this 
would also mean that in the piston intermediate position (piston between top dead center and bottom 
dead center) the inertia forces of the counterweights work in a lateral direction. The result would be 
vibrations which are transmitted via the crankshaft bearing to the crankcase and finally to the entire 
vehicle. 

This conflict can be resolved through the use of counterbalance shafts, as well as clever weight 
classification of the counterweights at the crankshaft.

4-cylinder engine 


This example shows why the design plays a role in which forces or torques occur during engine 
operation. 

In contrast, the forces which occur at the crankshaft of the 4-cylinder engine when the engine is 
running cancel each other out. Free moments of inertia therefore do not occur. 

Order 

The inertia forces are divided into "orders". The more frequently an inertia force occurs during each 
crankshaft revolution (360°), the greater its order of magnitude will be. 

The free inertial forces and torques categorized as follows: 

• Inertia forces, 1 st order 

• Inertia forces, 2nd order 

• Inertia torques, 1 st order 

• Inertia torques, 2nd order. 

The following table provides an overview of the arising forces and torques depending on the design 
and number of cylinders

The table provides information on which forces and torques occur and their order of magnitude. Free 
inertial forces and moments of inertia of the first order are the most noticeable. Free inertia forces and 
moments of inertia of the second order are perceived is much less troublesome. The greater the order 
of magnitude is therefore, the more it can be disregarded for the purposes of mass balancing. 

The table shows that the best engine design in terms of smooth running is the 6-cylinder in-line 
engine. All forces cancel each other out. Therefore, with this engine design no additional measures for 
neutralizing the rotating or oscillating masses have to be implemented.

As can be seen in the previous graphic, both pistons are at top or bottom dead center at the same 
time. If the crankshaft is rotated 45° counter-clockwise and the two piston positions are compared, it 
becomes clear that the paths covered by both pistons differ. Piston 1, which started from the top dead 
center position, covers a greater distance than piston 2 from the bottom dead center position. As both 
pistons cover a different distance in the same period, they must have travelled at different speeds. This 
speed difference affects the acceleration and deceleration of the oscillating masses, thus leading to 
undesired oscillations. As this process occurs twice per crankshaft revolution, these are referred to as 
free inertia forces of the 2nd order.

B46 Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 

The B46 engine has two counterbalance shafts which rotate at twice the speed of the crankshaft. 

The gears of the counterbalance shafts have 48 teeth. The gear of the crankshaft has 96 teeth. 

A correct setting of the two counterbalance shafts is a prerequisite for reduction of the oscillations. 
Using a special tool the counterbalance shafts can be secured in their specified installation position 
in Service. 

A gear between the crankshaft and the counterbalance shaft effects the change of rotational direction 
of the right counterbalance shaft. In the new condition, the tooth flanks of the idler gear have a special 
coating. This coating helps adjust the tooth backlash between the counterbalance shaft and the 
crankshaft during installation in Service. An incorrectly adjusted tooth backlash can lead to running 
noises of the gears when the engine is running. 

A_ 

A newly coated idler gear must be installed for setting the counterbalance shafts. 

The repair instructions must be followed. 


2.2.6. Torsional vibration damper 

A torsional vibration damper is used on the belt drive of B46 engine. The torsional vibration damper 
assumes the following tasks: 

• Reduction of the torsional oscillations of the crankshaft. 

• Reduction of the rotational deformity of the supporting components.

Vibration damper 

The vibration damper comprises a hub, a rubber element, which acts as a spring, and a flywheel, which 
serves as weight. The rotary oscillations of the crankshaft are reduced by the combined action of 
the spring and mass element. This reduces the load of the crankshaft and the noises emitted by the 
engine. 

Uncoupled belt pulley 

The uncoupled belt pulley is important for smooth low-wear drive of supporting components. The 
belt pulley is uncoupled from the hub by the rubber isolation element. The rubber isolation element 
permits greater rotation, and reduces the remaining rotational imbalance and thereby the load on the 
drive belt. The belt pulley is supported by the plain bearing. 

A_ 

To avoid damage to the torsional vibration damper, the engine must not be operated 
without drive belts. 


2.2.7. Chain drive 

Features: 

• Chain drive at the side of the engine emitting the forces. 

• Two-part chain drive for drive of camshafts, synergy parts for the diesel engines. 

• Simple sleeve-type chains. 

• Electric motor of the combined oil-vacuum pump via a separate chain. 

• Plastic tensioning rails and guide rails. 

• Hydraulic chain tensioner with spring preload.

The chain drive is on the transmission side. The inertia of the transmission at this engine end 
significantly reduces the rotary oscillations and also therefore the loads acting on the chain drive. 

The B46 engine is equipped with a two-part chain drive. With this arrangement, the bottom timing 
chain drives the camshaft sprocket of the intermediate shaft. The drive torque is simply diverted to the 
top timing chain via the intermediate shaft. 

Sufficient lubrication of the bottom timing chain is ensured by the oil mist in the crankcase and the 
engine oil that drips off. 

The combined oil-vacuum pump is also driven by the crankshaft via a separate drive chain.

The timing chain is always tensioned on the unloaded side. This is performed by a tensioning rail on

chain tensioner. There is an opening in the tensioning rail to ensure that oil reaches the top timing 
chain.

2.3.2. VANOS 

The valve overlap times have a significant impact on the characteristics of the engine. An engine with 
smaller valve overlap therefore tends to have a high maximum torque at low engine speeds but the 
maximum power which can be achieved at high engine speeds is low. The maximum power achieved 
with a large valve overlap on the other hand is higher, but this is at the expense of the torque at low 
engine speeds. 

The VANOS provides a solution. It makes a high torque possible in the low and medium engine speed 
range and a high maximum power in the higher engine speed ranges. A further benefit of the VANOS 
is the option of internal EGR. This reduces the emission of harmful nitrogen oxides NOx, particularly in 
the partial load range. The following is also achieved: 

• Faster heating up of catalytic converter. 

• Lower pollutant emissions during cold start. 

• Reduction in consumption.

Reason for using the double VANOS 

The advantages of a Valvetronic are lower charge cycle losses and therefore potential for reducing fuel 
consumption by adopting an appropriate driving style. However, in contrast to throttle valve-controlled 
systems, Valvetronic cannot reduce charge-cycle losses in the full load range. 

VANOS unit 

With older VANOS systems, such as that used in the N55 engine, the VANOS units were controlled by 
separate VANOS solenoid valves integrated into oil ducts in the cylinder head. 

The oil ducts in the cylinder head are reduced and the adjustment speed is increased by using a 
VANOS solenoid valve unit and a mechanical VANOS central valve, which is located inside the VANOS 
unit.

The locking pin ensures that the VANOS unit adopts a clear, locked position in the depressurized 
state. The locking spring ensures the unit is locked by continuously pushing the locking pin into the 
locked position when the actuator is de-energized. The VANOS unit is blocked in this condition. The 
timing can be adjusted in this way. This is important when the engine is started to ensure exact timing. 
The oil pressure which is present for timing advance simultaneously unlocks the locking pin via oil 
ducts in the VANOS unit. If the camshaft is to be “advanced”, the locking pin is then forced by the 
applied oil pressure against the locking spring towards the cartridge and the locking cover is released 
for VANOS adjustment. 

The following graphic shows the oil flow rate in the VANOS central valve which is used to control the 
camshaft adjustment:

The oil flow is controlled by means of the plunger.

The Valvetronic comprises a fully-variable valve lift control and a double VANOS. It operates according 
to the principle of throttle-free load control. With this system, a throttle valve is only used to stabilize 
the engine operation at critical operating points and to ensure a slight vacuum for the engine 
ventilation. A very small vacuum can be produced in the intake pipe by slightly tilting the throttle valve, 
which allows treated blow-by gases to be introduced into the intake port during naturally-aspirated 
engine operation.

Height of installation space 


By reworking the Valvetronic, it has, most importantly, been possible to significantly reduce the 
installation space. A considerable height advantage has been gained by swapping round the intake 
camshaft and the eccentric shaft. The new position of the intermediate lever and gate simplifies the 
application of force in the cylinder head. The gate is therefore only attached to the bearing support 
with one screw and is positioned via two precise contact surfaces in the cylinder head. The return 
spring for the intermediate lever between the cylinder head and bearing position is self-supporting 
and does not require its own attachment point. The eccentric shaft is, as is already the case with the 
camshaft, an "assembled" design.

Due to the fast adjustment speeds of the eccentric shaft of less than 300 milliseconds from minimum 
to maximum stroke and the wide adjustment range from 0.2 millimeters (minimum) to 9.9 millimeters 
(maximum) valve lift with a small transmission ratio, sufficient lubrication between the worm gear of 
the Valvetronic servomotor and drive pinion of the eccentric shaft must be ensured. The lubricating oil 
reaches the oil chamber via an inlet bore hole at the first bearing position of the eccentric shaft. Here, 
the oil volume rises to the lower edge of the outlet bore hole. The excess oil flows back to the oil circuit 
via the outlet bore hole. The gearing of the worm gear is now supported in the oil bath and is therefore 
lubricated at all times. 

Information on disassembly and installation work 

As numerous changes have been made, a new special tool is used to remove the return springs. 

The hexagon socket on the Valvetronic servomotor is for manual adjustment of the worm gear. This 
is necessary if the Valvetronic servomotor needs to be removed, for example. To avoid damage to the 
worm gear, it must be greased prior to start-up using a special lubricant (Longtime PD part number: 

83 19 2 160 340). The Valvetronic in the Digital Motor Electronics (DME) can be taught-in using the 
teach-in routine in ISTA. During this process, the limit positions of the system are determined once 
again and stored in the Digital Motor Electronics (DME). The precise procedure for removing the 
Valvetronic is described in the current repair instructions.

for belt elongation over the full service life. 

A standard belt with 6 ribs is used.

With force-fed circulation lubrication the oil is drawn out of the oil sump by the oil pump through 
an intake pipe and forwarded into the circuit. The oil passes through the engine oil cooler with an 
integrated full-flow oil filter and from there into the main oil duct, which runs in the engine block parallel 
to the crankshaft. Branch ducts lead to the crankshaft main bearings. There are bore holes between 
the main bearings of the crankshaft and the connecting rod bearing journal which admit the oil to the 
lubricating points of the connecting rod bearing. 

Some of the oil is diverted from the main oil duct and directed to the cylinder head to the relevant 
lubricating points and adjustment units. When the engine oil flows through the consumers, it either 
returns to the oil sump via the return ducts or it drips back freely.

The B46 engine is equipped with the familiar map-controlled oil pump which is already used. 

The actual oil pressure is recorded via an oil pressure sensor and forwarded to the Digital Motor 
Electronics (DME). The Digital Motor Electronics performs a target/actual comparison based on the 
stored characteristic maps. The map-controlled control valve is activated by means of a pulse-width 
modulated signal until the nominal pressure stored in the characteristic map has been reached. During 
this process, the delivery rate of the oil pump varies according to the oil pressure in the oil duct to the 
map-controlled control chamber. 


3.3. Oil pump 

The oil pump plays a central role in modern combustion engines. Due to the high power and enormous 
torque which is present even at low engine speeds, it is necessary to ensure a reliable oil supply. This 
is necessary on account of the high component temperatures and heavily loaded bearings. To achieve 
low fuel consumption, the delivery rate of the oil pump must be adapted to the requirements. 

The oil pump is driven by the crankshaft via a chain.

Bearing tube (center of rotation) 


A vacuum pump is integrated into the oil pump housing. 

A rotor with pendulum rotates as shown in the graphic on the pump shaft. A crescent-shaped cavity 
arises through the eccentric position. During this process, the oil is drawn into the expanding chamber 
(intake side) and is delivered via the contracting chamber (pressure side). 

When the engine is in operation, oil pressure is admitted to the map-controlled control surface and 
the second-level control surface of the oil pump. Depending on the oil pressure, the adjusting ring is 
pushed via the center of rotation at the bearing tube to varying degrees of force against the adjusting 
ring springs. The change in eccentric position of the adjusting ring changes the size of the chamber, 
and therefore also the intake and pressure power of the oil pump. 

To prevent overloading of the oil pump, a filter is installed upstream of the pump inlet. The maximum 
oil pressure of the oil circuit at the pump outlet is restricted by a pressure limiting valve. The opening 
pressure of the pressure limiting valve is 11.4 +/- 1.4 bar.

B46 Engine 
3. Oil Supply 

The oil pressure sensor is connected to the main oil duct and delivers the actual oil pressure at the 
Digital Motor Electronics (DME). The Digital Motor Electronics calculates the required nominal oil 
pressure based on the engine speed and fuel injection rate. A pulse-width modulated signal is sent to 
the map-controlled control valve based on the determined setpoint deviation. Depending on the pulse- 
width modulated signal, the width of the valve spool opening in the map-controlled control valve varies. 
Depending on the available opening cross-section, more or less engine oil can flow from the oil duct of 
the oil filter into the oil duct and to the oil pump. This oil flow changes the position of the adjusting ring 
in the oil pump, and therefore the delivery rate of the pump. 

3.3.2. Normal operation 

The oil pump has two separate control loops in order to guarantee normal operation (map-controlled 
control operation) and emergency operation (second-level control operation). 



Oil circuit during normal operation, B46 engine 


This control loop operates with an external map-controlled valve. The map-controlled control valve 
controls the oil pressure in the map-controlled control chamber via a software in the Digital Motor 
Electronics. If the oil pressure in the map-controlled control chamber increases, the adjusting ring 
further compresses the adjusting ring spring and the pump eccentricity is reduced. This results in a 
lower volumetric flow.

B46 Engine 
3. Oil Supply 

3.3.3. Emergency operation 



Oil circuit during emergency operation, B46 engine 


During emergency operation, the system operates without the map control by the Digital Motor 
Electronics. The map-controlled control valve is de-energized in this operating condition and is 
therefore closed. The purpose of the emergency operation is to maintain the oil pressure in the oil 
pump at a consistently high level. The oil pressure is guided directly from the main oil duct to the 
second-level control chamber. This leads to an adjustment of the adjusting ring against the adjusting 
ring spring and thus a reduction of the volumetric flow. As it contains no actuators, intervention in this 
control system is not possible and it also cannot be switched off.

3.4. Suction pipe 

The oil pump draws oil from the oil sump through the intake pipe. The suction pipe is positioned

incorporates an oil strainer, which prevents coarse dirt particles from getting into the oil pump.

The pressure limiting valve is responsible for protecting the oil pump and the oil circuit against 
overloading. This valve opens at an oil pressure of > 10 bar and directs the excess engine oil back to 
the oil sump. This valve is used if necessary when starting the engine at cold ambient temperatures 
(values < 0 °C), as the viscosity of the engine oil is very high here.

Hexagon head for opening the oil drain plug 


Due to the construction space, the oil filter housing is suspended in the transverse mounting. 
The inspection is carried out from the bottom of the vehicle. Using an oil drain plug the Service 
employee can drain the engine oil from the oil filter module before opening the oil filter cover.

In Service, the specified torques for the oil drain plug and the oil filter cover must be observed. The two 
O-rings must be replaced each time the oil filter cover and the oil drain plug are opened. Both O-rings 
are included in the oil filter service kit.

3. Oil Supply 

3.6.1. Filter bypass valve 

When a filter is blocked, the filter bypass valve ensures that engine oil reaches the lubrication points of 
the engine. It opens when the differential pressure upstream and downstream of the oil filter is 2.5 bar 
± 0.3 bar. 


3.6.2. Heat exchanger bypass valve 

The heat exchanger bypass valve has the same function as the filter bypass valve. If, on account of a 
blocked oil-to-water heat exchanger, the oil pressure rises, the heat exchanger bypass valve opens at 
an oil pressure of 2.5 bar ± 0.3 bar and the lubricating oil can flow uncooled to the lubrication points.

To ensure the engine runs perfectly, only engine oils approved by BMW can be used.

4. Cooling System 

In order to protect the thermally loaded engine components, the engine oil and the transmission oil 
from overheating, they are cooled using coolant. A mechanical coolant pump circulates the coolant in 
the cooling circuit. The heat quantities introduced to the coolant are emitted to the ambient air again 
using a radiator. An electric fan assists the radiator output. 

The coolant in the B46 engine is mainly circulated via a mechanical coolant pump. Several engines are 
also equipped with an electrical overrun pump which maintains a trickle of coolant to the bearing seat 
cooling system of the exhaust turbocharger. 

The following graphics provide an overview of the different cooling circuits.

• Coolant-cooled exhaust turbocharger 

• Mechanical coolant pump 

• Electric coolant pump 

• Characteristic map thermostat 

Due to the twin-scroll technology, the B46 engines are equipped with a steel manifold. 'Twin-scroll' 
means that the exhaust flows are routed via two separate channels to the exhaust turbocharger. The 
heat produced is absorbed by the coolant which is supplied via a coolant connection on the exhaust 
turbocharger. When the motor is not running, post-cooling of the exhaust turbocharger is possible with 
the assistance of an electric coolant pump (20 W). This prevents a build-up of heat in the area of the 
exhaust turbocharger. 

For more in-depth explanations on the exhaust turbocharger, refer to the chapter Intake air and exhaust 
emission system.

The expansion tank is used as a reservoir for the coolant. The expansion tank ensures that there is 
always a sufficient quantity of coolant available in the cooling circuit. 

In the sealing cap there is a pressure relief valve which restricts the pressure in the system. 

The sealing cap must never be opened when the engine is hot. The reason for this is not just the risk 
of burning. In higher areas of the cooling circuit, such as the cylinder head, gas bubbles may form as a 
result of the loss of pressure. Sufficient heat dissipation is no longer guaranteed at these points. 

This would result in overheating.

There is a visible filling level indicator in the expansion tank. The filling level can be read when the tank 
is open. The filling level should be between maximum and minimum for correct filling. 


4.6. Coolant 

The familiar coolant with a silicone base is used. The coolant is not subject to a change interval. 

The filling is designed for the entire service life of the engine. For work which requires an opening of 
the cooling circuit the coolant must be replaced. The precise procedure for ventilating the cooling 
circuit can be found in the current repair instructions. 

A 

The cooling system must only be filled with BMW-approved coolant. If the wrong coolant is used, 
damage to the coolant pumps, coolant hoses, radiators and cylinder head gasket may subtly creep in.

The air duct of the differentiated air intake system differs depending on the installation position. 

This documentation only deals with the air duct in the transverse-mounted Bx8 engine. 

The intake unfiltered air reaches the intake silencer with air cleaner via the unfiltered air line with intake 
air grille. The unfiltered air is filtered in the intake silencer with air cleaner and becomes clean air. Then 
the clean air is directed to the exhaust turbocharger via the hot film air mass meter and the clean air 
pipe with resonator. The blow-by gases from the crankcase are also introduced, depending on the load 
condition, into the clean air pipe upstream of the exhaust turbocharger, or into the intake ports directly. 

The clean air is compressed and heated in the exhaust turbocharger. The compressed, warm charge 
air is further directed to the charge air cooler in the charge air hose. From the charge air cooler the now 
cooled charge air is directed to the throttle valve via an additional charge air hose and the adapter pipe 
with charge air temperature and charging pressure sensor. The cooled charge air is taken to the intake 
air system via the throttle valve. 

5.1.1. Intake silencer 

The intake silencer is mounted on the engine and contains the air cleaner. Air which has been inducted 
up to the air filter is referred to as fresh air. After leaving the air filter the cleaned air is referred to as 
clean air.

5.1.2. Charge air cooling 



Charge air cooler 


Because the air heats up during compression in the exhaust turbocharger and thus expands, the 
amount of oxygen which can be routed into the combustion chamber is reduced again. The charge 
air cooler has a counteractive effect in that it cools the compressed air. The density is thus increased 
and the oxygen content per volume is also increased. The charge air cooler is located in the cooling 
module below the radiator. It is an air-air heat exchanger. The compressed air flows through the charge 
air cooler in several plates, around which for their part the cooling air flows.

Electric wastegate valve 


The exhaust turbocharger of the B46 engine is a twin-scroll exhaust turbocharger. To facilitate a fast 
and direct response, the exhaust flows from cylinders 1 and 4, and 2 and 3 are merged and routed to 
the compressor via two separate channels. This principle is referred to as pulse turbocharging. 


The exhaust manifold and exhaust turbocharger housing have been designed as one common cast 
part and cannot be replaced individually. 

The charging pressure is adjusted via an electrical actuator. 


5.2.2. Blow-off valve 

A blow-off valve is not used in current models. Pressure peaks, caused by sudden load shedding 
due to the inertia of the turbine of the exhaust turbocharger, can be avoided by careful tuning of the 
Digital Motor Electronics software. With foresighted charging pressure control, pressure peaks can be 
predicted and reduced by quick adjustment of the electrically-adjustable wastegate valve. Assisted 
by a delayed load control of the Valvetronic (in the minimum lift direction) or the throttle valve (in the 
closed direction), the remaining charge air which is produced can be routed to the exhaust emission 
system via the engine. This form of control thus prevents the exhaust turbocharger shaft from being 
exposed to excessive torsional stress due to high pressure peaks. 

5.2.3. Charging pressure control 

The charging pressure in B46 engines is controlled via an electrically adjustable wastegate valve. 

Electrified adjustment 

In contrast to a vacuum-controlled charging pressure control, the following components are not 
required: 

• Vacuum unit 

• Vacuum lines 

• Electro-pneumatic pressure converter 

• Vacuum reservoir

The actuator of the electrically adjustable wastegate valve can be replaced separately in Service. 

Each time the adjusting linkage is activated, the system must be re-adjusted with the assistance of 
the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. This measure is not required when replacing the entire exhaust 
turbocharger as the linkage is supplied preset.

If the actuator is replaced individually, a teach-in routine must be performed using the BMW diagnosis 
system ISTA.

The sensor is used to determine the position of the wastegate valve. The wastegate valve can move 
to any required position between maximum open and maximum closed. When the sensor signal or 
actuator drops out, the wastegate valve adopts the open position to allow charging pressure to build 
up. This ensures the journey continues with reduced engine performance.

Measures for reduction of exhaust gas emissions 

• Precise and fast charging pressure control. 

• Catalytic converter heating during cold start. 

• Positioning of catalytic converter near engine. 

• New LSF Xfour voltage-jump sensor by Bosch. 


Catalytic converter heating 

When starting the combustion engine from cold, the wastegate valve is opened as wide as possible 
and the ignition point is adjusted to retard. The retarded ignition point delays the combustion process 
which in turn supports the heat input for heating of the catalytic converter. As the turbine housing is 
short, it has been possible to position the catalytic converter very close to the wastegate valve. As the 
exhaust gas flows into the catalytic converter at the perfect angle and because of its position close 
to the engine, the catalytic converter reaches its operating temperature very quickly. If the wastegate 
valve is opened when cold, pulsation of the exhaust gas may cause vibrations in the wastegate valve, 
which are perceived as noise. This is not due to a defective component, and is normal running noise. 
This noise becomes less audible as the temperature of the component increases. 

Control sensor 

With a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio (A=1), the proportion of oxygen in the exhaust gas is ideal for 
conversion of the pollutants in the 3-way catalytic converter. By measuring the oxygen content in the 
exhaust gas, the oxygen sensor of the Digital Motor Electronics delivers important information for 
mixture preparation. 

A broadband oxygen sensor with the designation LSU ADV has been specially developed for engines 
with exhaust turbochargers and is used as the control sensor. One of the major characteristics of 
broadband oxygen sensors is their extensive measuring range. The measuring range of the LSU ADV 
is from a lambda of A=0.65 to A=air. 

The broadband oxygen sensor LSU ADV is a combination of a measuring cell and pump cell. There is 
a small diffusion gap between these two cells which serves as a measuring chamber and is connected 
to the exhaust gas duct. The measuring cell operates according to the principle of a voltage-jump 
sensor and measures the residual oxygen content in the exhaust gas. If the fuel-air mixture is too lean 
(A > 1), the control electronics applies voltage to the pump cell so that oxygen ions are pumped out 
of the diffusion gap. If the mixture is too rich (A < 1), oxygen ions are pumped into the diffusion gap 
by activating the pump cell accordingly. The pump flow required to control the pump cell is directly 
proportional to the oxygen concentration and therefore serves as the control variable for the air ratio. 

The control strategy has been devised so that the oxygen concentration in the area of the diffusion 
gap corresponds to an air ratio of A = 1. As this control method is extremely fast and incredibly 
accurate, the voltage value of the measuring cell always remains at a constant level (450 mV). 

The following graphic shows the two voltage curves of the measuring cell and the pump cell when the 
engine is in operation:

In the positive range of the control voltage (U > 0 V), there is excess oxygen in the area of the diffusion 
gap (A > 1). The engine is running slightly too lean. The pump cell pumps oxygen out of the diffusion 
gap in order to maintain the level of 450 mV in the measuring cell constant. 

In the negative range of the control voltage (U < 0 V), there is insufficient oxygen in the area of the 
diffusion gap (A < 1). The engine is running slightly too rich. The pump cell pumps oxygen into the 
diffusion gap in order also to maintain the level of 450 mV in the measuring cell constant. 

An integrated heating element ensures that the broadband oxygen sensor quickly reaches its 
operating temperature.

As the running surfaces of the vacuum pump are coated with oil, the volume of air drawn in cannot 
be released into the atmosphere. The air volume delivered by the vacuum pump is transferred to 
the crankcase via discharge valves. From here, it reaches the air intake system via the crankcase 
ventilation.

7.1. Fuel pump control module 

In contrast to the EKPS control unit previously used, the new gas engines have a fuel pump control 
module. The fuel pump control module is not shown in the control unit overview. The fuel pump 
control module is responsible for processing information about the necessary fuel pressure from 
the Digital Motor Electronics (DME) and for activating the electric fuel pump according to these 
requirements via a three-phase AC voltage. 


7.2. Electric fuel pump 

The electric fuel pump is activated as required. The requirements are calculated by the Digital Motor 
Electronics (DME). The request regarding the extent of the fuel low pressure is sent to the fuel pump 
control module with the assistance of a pulse-width modulated signal (PWM signal). The fuel pump 
control module processes the pulse-width modulated signal and with help of an inverter generates a 
three-phase AC voltage U, V, W to activate the three-phase motor of the electric fuel pump according 
to requirements. 

If the PWM data line is disconnected, the electric fuel pump is activated with the maximum system 
performance. If a PWM data line is interrupted, this only leads to a fault code entry. The customer is 
not informed about this status, by the illumination of a warning and indicator light, for example. The 
electric fuel pump is designed for continuous full load operation and is also not damaged if the PWM 
data line is interrupted for an longer period.

There is no fuel pressure sensor in the low-pressure range of the fuel system. The fuel low pressure is 
calculated in the Digital Motor Electronics based on a mathematical model. The power consumption of 
the electric fuel pump also provides information on the fuel low pressure. If the power consumption is 
high, this means that a high fuel - low pressure exists and if the power consumption is low, this means 
that a lower fuel - low pressure prevails.

the high pressure lines have been omitted and the injectors are attached to the rail directly. 

Directly connecting the solenoid valve injectors to the rail has the following advantages: 


Less volume needs to be available for high-pressure injection. 

Fewer interfaces and therefore less problematic with respect to leaks. 
Short cycle times during production due to compact design.

pressure pump via the fuel feed from the electric fuel pump.

Due to the high fuel pressures, the fuel lines must never be detached when the engine is in operation. 
When removing the high pressure pump, follow the specifications in the current repair instructions. 
Excessive tilting of the pump can damage the pump piston!

Electrical connection of quantity control valve 


The quantity control valve at the high pressure pump adjusts the fuel pressure in the rail. The 
maximum pressure in the rail is 200 bar. The high pressure pump contains a pressure limiting valve 
which opens at a pressure of 245 bar. The quantity control valve is activated via a pulse-width- 
modulated (PWM) signal and assumes the open position in the de-energized state. This means the 
pump piston of the high pressure pump cannot compress the fuel. 

It follows that the high pressure pump cannot build up pressure in the high-pressure fuel system when 
the quantity control valve is removed. In this situation, the maximum fuel low pressure (6.5 bar) would 
be present in the rail during an engine start. The system would be in emergency operation. To ensure 
the engine remains capable of running in this state, the opening period of the solenoid valve injectors 
has been extended and the idle speed increased. Although the vehicle remains drivable, the maximum 
engine performance is not available. 

A_ 

The quantity control valve is not resistant to continuous current. A permanent current supply with 12V 
direct current voltage would render the component defective.

Holding clamp with bayonet fitting 


Solenoid valve injector 


The solenoid valve injectors are fastened to the holding clamp with a bayonet fitting. There is a plastic 
sleeve between the holding clamp and direct rail. This is not designed to collect escaping fuel. Its only 
purpose is to carry out a helium pressure test during pre-assembly at the factory in order to check the 
tightness. After the initial assembly, this plastic sleeve is of no relevance to the engine operation. When 
the solenoid valve injectors are replaced, the plastic sleeves are no longer required and do not need to 
be reinserted. 

When manufacturing the holding clamp, casting lugs are produced when the component is detached 
from the tool. Due to the low installation tolerances, when installing the solenoid valve injectors it must 
be ensured that these casting lugs point in the direction of the exhaust manifold. If they are pointing in 
the wrong direction (towards the intake pipe), this can lead to mechanical contact between the holding 
clamp and cylinder head cover.

The mounting bolts of the holding clamp must be replaced each time they are released.

The shank of the solenoid valve injectors is sensitive to high tensile forces and rotational angles. 
When removing and installing the solenoid valve injectors, the procedure in the current repair 
instructions must be followed! If the solenoid valve injectors are damaged, fuel may be discharged.

As is already the case with the N55 and N20 engines, the new B46 engine is equipped with the Bosch 
HDEV 5.2 solenoid valve injector. The designation of the injectors is a combination of the following: 

• HDEV = high-pressure fuel injection valve 

• 5 = generation designation 

• 1 = maximum fuel injection pressure of 150 bar 

• 2 = maximum fuel injection pressure of 200 bar 

If current is supplied to the solenoid coil, a magnetic field is produced which attracts the magnet 
armature. The magnet armature runs upwards on the nozzle needle. The linear travel of the magnet 
armature in the direction of the solenoid coil carries the nozzle needle along with it and the nozzle 
bores are released in the direction of the combustion chamber. 

The repair instructions that are currently valid must be followed when removing and installing the 
injectors in Service. If the rotational angle at the shank of the injector is too large, this can lead to 
damage and therefore leaks in the fuel system. 

A special fuel additive is recommended in markets with a poor fuel grade to prevent coking of injectors 
in direct injection systems. The additive is added to the fuel in the fuel tank from where it arrives at the 
injectors. 

A_ _ 

Coking at the injectors is reduced by using a BMW-approved additive (part no. 83 19 2 183 738). 


ULEV II measures at the solenoid valve injector 

Due to the more stringent exhaust gas emission regulations which are required to meet the ULEV II 
exhaust emission standards, technical changes had to be made to the solenoid valve injectors. 

As is the case with diesel fuel passenger cars which has been dealt with previously, in addition to the 
limit value for particulate mass (PM), the limit value for the particle concentration (PN) is also stipulated 
in the ULEV II exhaust emission standards for gas passenger cars. 

The reason for this is that in modern gas engines with direct injection no homogeneous fuel/air mixture 
arises in comparison to engines with intake pipe fuel injection. There are therefore more particles in 
the exhaust gas (particulate matter). 


122 










B46 Engine

Different diameters of laser-manufactured bore holes are used with the new high-pressure fuel 
injection valves, for example. The fuel quantity of the two spray jets in the exhaust direction is reduced 
by 20 %, which increases the other spray jets by 10 % respectively. 

The solenoid valve injectors can only be used in a predefined position in the injector shaft of the 
cylinder head. This ensures correct alignment of the injection pattern in the combustion chamber. 

The following graphic illustrates the differences between the ULEV and ULEVII version:

High-pressure fuel injection valves with solenoid coils do not have a linear behavior pattern across the 
entire service life, mainly in the area of minimal quantity fuel injection. This means over the service 
life the fuel injection rates vary from one injector to another injector. Although the high-pressure fuel 
injection valves are adapted during start-up via the injection quantity compensation code in the Digital 
Motor Electronics, in order to compensate for possible manufacturing tolerances of the individual 
high-pressure fuel injection valves in the Digital Motor Electronics, and to adapt all injectors in relation 
to one another, this only happens once during start-up (injection quantity compensation). During 
conventional operation, the parameters for activation of the injectors, such as current and activation 
duration, are the same for all injectors throughout the entire operating time and cannot be individually 
adapted. Another adaptation during the entire operating time is no longer possible. This would lead to 
breaches of the strict exhaust gas emissions legislation, such as ULEVII, during the operating time. 

An automatic operation allows precise dosing of fuel, particularly when using extremely small injection 
quantities. Analysis of the voltage and current curve in injector mode allows conclusions to be drawn 
about the movement of the needle. The most important information in relation to the movement of the 
needle is the needle travel and opening period. The fuel injection rate can be determined from these 
two variables. It has therefore been possible to omit printing of a injection quantity compensation code 
on the ULEV II solenoid valve injectors. 

Controlled Valve Operating (CVO) 

A software in the Digital Motor Electronics permanently ensures automatic operation of the solenoid 
valve injectors throughout the entire operating time. 

The basic principle of this CVO function is that the precise opening period of the high-pressure fuel 
injection valves is determined. The Digital Motor Electronics can determine the precise opening period 
based on the following parameters: 

• Power consumption of the high-pressure fuel injection valve 

• Voltage of the high-pressure fuel injection valve

These current and voltage values change in the event of a needle movement in the high-pressure fuel 
injection valve, for example: 


• Armature mists up - when the needle valve is withdrawn from the valve seat. 

• Armature moves - needle valve moves in direction of open position. 

• Armature stationary - needle valve comes to rest at the maximum open position. 

• Reverse movement. 

• Armature moves - needle valve moves in direction of closed position. 

• Armature suffers impact and is braked hydraulically - needle valve closed. 


With these values, calculated from current and voltage values from the above mentioned needle 
movements, the Digital Motor Electronics can determine the actual opening period of the high- 
pressure fuel injection valves. If the precise opening periods are known, the Digital Motor Electronics 
can also determine the exact fuel injection rate based on this information. 


125 










B46 Engine 
7. Fuel System 

If variable fuel injection rates are now to be used, the Digital Motor Electronics can vary the fuel 
injection rate throughout the opening period by activating the respective high-pressure fuel injection 
valve individually. The Digital Motor Electronics thus has the option to adjust all high-pressure fuel 
injection valves to the same nominal fuel injection rate. 

This measure guarantees the same nominal fuel injection rate in all cylinders, especially in the range 
where extremely small amounts are injected, as well as at idle speed, so that the exhaust re-treatment 
can always work efficiently. This measure inside the engine reduces exhaust emissions and therefore 
ensures compliance with the existing exhaust emission standards. 

Cylinder Imbalance Monitoring (CIM) 

The "Cylinder Imbalance Monitoring" function is an additional software function in the Digital 
Motor Electronics which monitors the correctness of the mixture preparation. The primary aim is to 
determine, with the assistance of this function, age-related operating time impairments of the fuel and 
intake area. Conclusions can be drawn about the air flow differences and different fuel injection rates, 
for example. These kind of differences are normally attributable to age-related leaks of the intake- 
components and pressure fluctuations in the rail or coking of the injectors. 

The following graphic illustrates the operating principle of the Cylinder Imbalance Monitoring software:

Speed of test cylinder significantly slower 


The function is cyclically actuated by the Digital Motor Electronics. During this process, the air/fuel 
ratio is increased for each cylinder in succession during engine operation. At the same time as the air/ 
fuel ratio in the test cylinder is increased, the remaining cylinders are enriched in order to maintain 
the overall lambda value of the exhaust gas passage within the range A=1. This ensures perfect 
functionality of the 3-way catalytic converter. 

If a test cylinder is operated when the air/fuel ratio is too low, a slight increase will not bring about a 
change in the crankshaft speed. 

When the air/fuel ratio in a test cylinder is increased in the ideal range, this brings about a slight change 
in speed at the crankshaft. 

If a test cylinder is operated when the air/fuel ratio is too high, the speed at the crankshaft drops 
rapidly. 

The engine speed variations at the crankshaft are not evaluated directly, but rather the changes in 
smooth running during engine operation. Rough running of the cylinders in relation to one another is 
balanced out by a so-called 'cylinder balancing control'. The test cylinder in the rich range therefore 
brings about a minor change in rough running and the test cylinder in the lean range brings about a 
major change in rough running. 

Mixture errors determined are stored as a fault code entry in the Digital Motor Electronics. The fault 
code entry provides information about which cylinder is affected and the rich or lean value determined. 
The driver is informed about the error via a malfunction indicator lamp.

Service note 

When replacing the injector, the taught-in values of the CVO function and CIM function must be 
reset. This is done with the assistance of the BMW diagnosis system ISTA. Adjustment functions are 
available in the service functions. In order to inform the Digital Motor Electronics about the injector 
replacement, every ULEVII solenoid valve injector with the same dummy value (215) is taught in. 
Once the teach-in procedure has been successfully completed, the stored adaptations are reset and 
new adaptations are taught in via the CVO and CIM function.

8.1. Digital Motor Electronics (DME) 

Different variants of the Digital Motor Electronics MEVD 17.2.3 are used, depending on the charge 
cycle method. The hardware of the throttle valve-controlled engine control units is therefore not the 
same as the hardware of the Valvetronic-controlled engine control units. 

The control unit number is made up of the following: 

• M = engine electronics 

• E = electrical load control (without cable) 

• V = Valvetronic control 

• D = direct fuel injection 

• 17 = control unit generation 

• 2 = Bosch-internal project number for BMW 

• 3 = control unit index 

The Digital Motor Electronics is the computing and switching center. Sensors on the engine and 
the vehicle deliver the input signals and actuators implement the commands. The Digital Motor 
Electronics calculates the corresponding activation signals for the actuators from the input signals, 
and also the computing models and characteristic maps stored. 

The operating voltage range of the Digital Motor Electronics is between 6 and 16 volts. 

An ambient pressure sensor and a temperature sensor are integrated in the Digital Motor Electronics. 

The ambient pressure sensor permits precise determination of the density of the ambient air. This 
information is required for various diagnostic functions. In addition, in the event of a failure of the hot 
film air mass meter, a precise substitute value can be calculated for the cylinder filling with the help of 
additional input variables. 

The temperature sensor measures the temperature inside the control unit. If the temperature there 
rises too sharply, multiple fuel injection is reduced for example, in order to cool the output stages 
slightly and to keep the temperature inside the control unit in a non-critical range.

8.3. Map ignition 

The B46 engine is equipped with an inductive ignition system with static ignition distribution. 

Each cylinder has a separate ignition coil which is inserted directly into the cylinder head cover. 

To achieve optimum consumption and minimum pollutant emissions and the highest possible torque, 
the ignition point must be perfectly adjusted. 

The following factors influence the ignition point: 

• Engine speed 

• Engine torque 

• Charging pressure 

• Current air ratio 

• Coolant temperature 

• Intake air temperature 

• Fuel grade 

• Operating condition (engine start) 


132 













B46 Engine 

8. Engine Electrical System 

These variables are recorded by the Digital Motor Electronics via sensors, processed with the 
assistance of different characteristic maps and output as control signals to the ignition coils. 

8.3.1. Diagnostic functions 

As faults in the area of the ignition system directly affect the quality of the exhaust gas, the ignition 
processes are monitored by the Digital Motor Electronics. During this process, the combustion period 
for the ignition of each individual cylinder is evaluated as a priority. The voltage difference of the 
primary coil at terminal 1 and terminal 15 is determined and evaluated by carrying out a measurement 
within the Digital Motor Electronics. An increased voltage difference is measurable while an ignition 
spark is present. The period of this voltage difference is referred to as 'combustion period'. 

The combustion period is not evaluated during the following operating conditions: 

• During the starting operation 

• Vehicle voltage <12 volts

Combustion period too short 

The minimum thresholds for the combustion period are determined by the Digital Motor Electronics 
depending on the engine speed and load. When these minimum thresholds are undercut and misfiring 
also occurs, a fault code entry "Combustion period too short" is stored in the Digital Motor Electronics. 

Combustion period outside the tolerance 

The current combustion period of all individual cylinders is read in and combined to obtain a mean 
value. As the speed and load is the same in all cylinders, the calculated mean value is similar to the 
individual values read in. By comparing the individual values with the mean value obtained, the Digital 
Motor Electronics (DME) can draw conclusions about the combustion period. If an individual value 
exceeds or undercuts the minimum thresholds stored, a fault code entry "Combustion period outside 
the tolerance" is stored in the Digital Motor Electronics. 

Note for Service 

Fault code entries with the note "Combustion period too short" or "Combustion period outside 
the tolerance" are not necessarily always attributable to a defect in one or several ignition coils. 
Combustion period abnormalities can be identified via the diagnosis entry in the Digital Motor 
Electronics, their causes can be found in many different engine systems. 

The following can cause deterioration of the combustion period: 

• Contact resistances at the engine wiring harness of the ignition coil. 

• Poor plug-in contact at the connector of the ignition coil. 

• Coil resistance of ignition coils outside the permissible range. 

• Ignition sparks inside silicone hose of the ignition coil. 

• Heavily carbon fouled spark plug(s). 

The following graphic shows a heavily sooted spark plug. 



Heavily carbon fouled spark plug 


The fault code entry "Combustion period too short" is frequently caused by one or several heavily 
carbon fouled spark plug(s). The carbon loading leads to deterioration of the ignition spark and 
therefore a very short combustion period. 


134 




B46 Engine 

8. Engine Electrical System 

Increased soot loading at the spark plugs accompanied by a reduction in the combustion period may 
be caused by the following: 

• Fault in the mixture preparation 

- leaks at the air intake system 

- fault at the injector 

- fault at the high pressure pump 

- deposits in the area of the intake valves 

• Fault in the engine electrical system 

- fault in the area of the coolant temperature sensor 

- fault in the area of the oxygen sensor 

- fault in the area of the hot film air mass meter 

• Large number of cold starts 

- frequent catalytic converter heating phases 

- few self-cleaning phases of the spark plugs 

With the fault code entry "Combustion period", a potential component fault at the relevant coil can be 
confirmed or disproved by cross-swapping the ignition coil. 

If misfiring occurs following component errors, different test modules in the workshop and diagnosis 
system ISTA can be processed. As the causes of faults in the ignition system are many and varied, the 
various test and diagnosis instructions in the test module must be followed. If a faulty component is 
replaced without eliminating the actual cause, this will only remedy the problem in the short term.

8. Engine Electrical System 


When servicing the ignition coils, observe the following: 

• A slight rotational movement when pulling out and inserting the ignition coils makes 
disassembly and installation easier. 

• There must be no sign of contamination by oil or other fluids in the area of the 
electrical plug-in contact. 

• The pins of the electrical plug-in contact must not be bent. 

• There must be no sign of cracking on the silicone hose. 

• The spring which transmits the ignition spark must be positioned at the center 
of the silicone hose. 

• The silicone hose of the ignition coils must not come into contact with fuel or mineral oils. 

• The specified torque of the mounting bolt must be observed. 

• Prior to disassembly of the ignition coil, remove the plug-in contact from the engine 
wiring harness, as the ignition coils cannot be operated without spark plugs. 


A 

The ignition coils are not fuel-resistant. All ignition coils should therefore be removed before opening 
the fuel system. Fuel residues must be removed before inserting the ignition coils in the spark plug 
shaft. 


8.3.3. Spark plugs 

The position of the spark plug electrode in the combustion chamber is therefore particularly important. 
To avoid coating the spark plug electrode with fuel, it is positioned geometrically between the fuel- 
injection spray of the injector. 

A change interval applies for spark plugs and they must be renewed in accordance with the 
manufacturer's specifications. To avoid damage and ensure perfect function of the spark plugs, 
the prescribed tightening torques must be observed.
