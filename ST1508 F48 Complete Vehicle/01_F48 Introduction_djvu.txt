F48 Introduction 

1. Introduction 


From October 2015 the new BMW F48 XI will be available. Since the introduction of the E84 in 
August of 2012, the F48 represents the second generation 
of the XI Sports Activity Vehicle. 

The F48 will currently be offered with xDrive only.. 

All engines in the F48 will be transversely mounted. 

In the US the F48 comes standard with a xDrive system that works with a clutch instead of a transfer 
box for the longitudinal torque distribution. 



BMW XI -F48 

In addition to the optional equipment, the F48 can also be individualized with the following equipment 
packages: 

• Luxury package 

• M sport package

2. Bodyshell 


2.1. Material properties of bodyshell 

The use of state-of-the-art steels, as well as the intelligent material mix, has a positive effect on the 
vehicle weight. The distinctive body rigidity ensures the driving dynamics typical of BMW. 



F48 Material properties of bodyshell 


Index 

Explanation 

1 

Multi-phase steels (> 300 MPa), 9 % of the body weight 

2 

Hot-formed steels (> 900 MPa), 4 % of the body weight 

3 

Other steels (< 300 MPa), 87 % of the body weight 


Multi-phase steels are steels where the structure consists of a number of phases. Higher-strength 
multi-phase steels with a yield strength R p q .2 of 300 to 600 MPa are, for example, dual-phase steels 
or TRIP steels. Super-strength multi-phase steels with a yield strength R p q .2 in excess of 600 MPa are, 
for example, complex-phase steels or martensitic-phase steels. 

Hot-formed manganese-boron steels are super-strength steels with a yield strength Rpoo .2 in excess 
of 900 MPa.

F48 Introduction 
3. Emissions Reduction 


In addition to the measures in the drive and chassis and suspension area, the weight reduction of the 
body, as well as the aerodynamics measures, help reduce the CO 2 emissions of the F48. 

A low body weight was also able to be achieved with the following measures: 

• Bulkhead, carrier support and B-pillar made from Taylor Rolled blanks 
(optimized material thickness). 

• Bumper support, front and rear, made from aluminium. 

• Engine compartment lid made from aluminium 

• High use of high-strength and super-strength multiphase steels and 
super-strength, hot-formed steels 

The following measures ensure a low drag: 

• Air ducts in front of the front wheel arches ("Air Curtain"). 

• Aeroblades and air guides in front of the front wheels ("Displacer"). 

• Rear spoiler and aeroblades at the side at the tailgate

F48 Introduction 
4. Doors, Lids and Hatches 


4.1. Doors 

The F48 outer door skin is welded to the inner door panel, in order to increase the rigidity of the doors. 

A further increase of the rigidity is achieved by additional laser welded seams between the inner door 
panels and the end plates:

F48 sealing tape, doors 

In order to reduce the noise level in the passenger compartment, additional sealing tape is clipped 
on to the inner door panels. The tape also helps reduce contamination in the sill areas.

Aeroblades 


Like in the FI 5, aeroblades are also attached at the side of the tailgate in the F48. Tear-off edges occur 
as a result of the side aeroblades and the rear spoiler, which cause the specific stall at the D-pillar. 

This lowers the total drag of the vehicle.

4.2.1. Automatic operation of tailgate 



F48 Automatic operation of tailgate 


An automatic operation of tailgate (SA 316) is standard for the F48. As is known from current BMW 
models, the tailgate is opened or closed by an electric spindle on the drivers side. 

Two hall effect sensors are installed in the spindle drive to detect the position of the tailgate. 

These are read out from the control unit for the automatic operation of the tailgate. 

The tailgate opens or closes automatically when it is actuated by one of the following buttons: 

• Button for the remote control or ID transmitter 

• Button on the tailgate, outer or inner 

• Button on the driver's door 

In conjunction with the optional equipment Comfort Access (SA 322), the tailgate can also be opened 
hands free by means of targeted foot movement. Two sensors detect the movement contactlessly via 
capacitive measurement.

The optional panorama glass roof (SA 402) allows greater outside light in the vehicle when the roller 
sunblind is open. For the first time at BMW, when fully opening the panorama glass roof, the front 
glass slide/tilt sunroof panel is pushed outwards across the rear glass slide/tilt sunroof panel. 

The roller sunblind is electrically adjustable. If the glass slide/tilt sunroof panel is put into a vent 
position, the roller sunblind moves back for the necessary air circulation. Side panels cover the area 
between the frame and the glass slide/tilt sunroof panel. 

The rear and front parts of the frame are made from plastic with steel inlays in order to reduce the 
weight and lower the vehicle's center of gravity. 

The following components of the panorama glass roof can be replaced without removing the roof liner: 

• Side panel, left 

• Side panel, right 

• Wind deflector 

• Glass slide/tilt sunroof panel, front 

• Glass slide/tilt sunroof panel, rear 

An emergency operation of the glass slide/tilt sunroof panel is possible using a hexagon socket 
wrench at the front drive.

Power front seats with drivers side memory is standard. Along with ISOFIX child seat mountings. 

An integrated side airbag, as well as a seat belt system with belt tensioner, are used for all front seat 
versions of the F48. The following equipment can be ordered: 

• Sport seats for driver and front passenger (SA 481) 

• Lumbar support for driver and front passenger (SA 488) 

• Seat heating for driver and front passenger (SA 494) 

• Heated front seats (SA 494)

The rear seat backrest is divided as standard into three sections in the ratio 40:20:40. Each individual 
section can be folded forwards separately via a loop at the rear seat backrest lower section. In the F48 
the rear seat backrests are no longer secured to the body using a connection, but are only secured at 
the pivot points via the latch mechanism. 

The rear head restraints can be adjusted very far downwards thanks to their L-shape, thus offering an 
optimal view of the rear.

Another new feature at BMW concerns the middle seat belt in the rear passenger compartment, 
whose inertia reel is housed between the roof and roof-liner. There are two buckles at the end of the 
seat belt, which are retained magnetically at the belt holder. To close the middle seat belt, the bottom 
buckle (3) must be inserted in the left seat belt buckle (4) and the top buckle (2) in the right seat belt 
buckle (5). 

The right seat belt buckle (5) is released using the red button in the buckle. The left seat belt buckle (4) 
is released using the belt end.

F48 examples of seat adjustment for rear seat 

With the optional equipment "Sliding and Reclining rear seat adjustment" (SA 4FD), the seat bench is 
divided in the ratio 60:40. Both sides can be adjusted 130 mm in a longitudinal direction, independent 
of each other. 

In addition, the inclination of the rear seat backrests can be adjusted in 2° steps. For instance, the 
seating comfort in the rear passenger compartment or the size of the luggage compartment can be 
optimized, depending on requirements.

In conjunction with the optional equipment "Sliding and Reclining rear seat adjustment" (SA 4FD), 
an electric remote unlocking of the rear seat backrests is also used. The corresponding rear seat 
backrests are unlocked electrically and then fold forwards by spring tension. 

The two buttons of the backrest remote unlocking are located in the luggage compartment on the 
left and right. By pressing the left button, the left and middle section of the rear seat backrest folds 
forward. By pressing the right button, the right section of the rear seat backrest folds forwards.

The luggage compartment capacity of the F48 is 505 liters and can be extended up to 1550 liters. 

The spatial offering can be used variably thanks to the functional spatial concept. Depending on the 
vehicle equipment, the following options are offered to change the luggage compartment capacity: 

• Folding down the rear seat backrest (separated in the ratio 40:20:40) 

• Tilt adjustment of the rear seat backrests (separated in the ratio 40:20:40) 

(Sliding and Reclining rear seat adjustment (SA 4FD) 

• Forward/back adjustment of the seat bench (separated in the ratio 60:40) 

(Sliding and Reclining rear seat adjustment (SA 4FD) 

A foldable luggage compartment floor enables easy access to the storage room underneath.
