The CAN buses are shown in the overview of the bus systems. The actual physical layout (topology) is 
shown using the example of the K-CAN2. 

As with most bus systems, terminating resistors are also used for protection of the K-CAN to avoid 
residual voltages on the data lines. 

The terminating resistors for the termination are located in the: 

• Body Domain Controller and 

• K-CAN terminators. 

All other control units are connected at the K-CAN terminator without a terminating resistor.

CAN terminator 



CAN terminator 

Depending on the equipment package, in the CAN terminator the terminating resistor for the 
corresponding CAN bus is installed. The terminating resistor comprises two resistances connected 
in series, each 60 Ohm. A measuring tap against ground with a capacitor for the reduction of high- 
frequency faults is also installed. Ferrite beads are installed for all bus lines in the CAN terminator. 
Ferrite beads suppress high-frequency faults on the CAN data lines, thus making possible line lengths 
of up to 5 m in the wiring harness. 

Ferrite core 

A ferrite core is a component made from the ferromagnetic material iron oxide hematite (Fe203). It is 
characterized by low or no conductivity. The inductance or the magnetic field is increased as part of a 
coil (throttle or transformer). If a ferrite core is secured around a conductor, which routes signals at low 
frequency or direct current voltage, high-frequency faults are attenuated with its help.

FlexRay data bus topology 

The FlexRay is shown in a simplified form in the data bus overview. The actual topology (star-shaped 
data bus topology) is shown in the graphic at the top. 

The star coupler with four drivers is located in the Body Domain Controller (BDC). The FlexRay control 
units are connected to these bus drivers independent of their termination type. 

Bus termination 

As with most bus systems, resistors are also used for termination for the FlexRay to avoid reflections 
on the data lines at both ends of the data lines. The value of these terminating resistors is calculated 
from the data transfer speed and the cable lengths. The terminating resistors are located in the control 
units. In the F48 the terminating resistors have a value of 90 ohm (total resistance 45 ohm). 

A_ 

Use the vehicle wiring diagram for measuring the (de-energized) FlexRay data bus for the 
determination of the line or terminating resistor. 


Signal properties 

Electrical faults, which arise from incorrect cable routing, contact resistances, etc. may cause faulty 
data transfer.

F48 General Vehicle Electronics 

1. Vehicle Electrical System 

The CAN bus system is an event-controlled bus system. Data is transmitted when an event occurs. 

As these events have different priorities (e.g. ambient temperature has a lower priority than a DSC 
intervention, for example), the priorities are also sent in the bus message. The message with the 
higher priority is sent first. As the control unit still wants to send the message which has the lower 
priority, it frequently results in overloading in the bus systems. 

The FlexRay works with so-called "time slots". With this method the messages are sent and are not 
controlled by events, but each control unit in the FlexRay network is assigned a fixed time slot in which 
it sends its message within a certain period. This time slot is synchronised with every restart of the 
data bus. The control units which synchronize the FlexRay are always labelled in the bus diagram with 
a "S" (see chapter 1.1). 

A_ 

The FlexRay can also be synchronised with the BMW diagnosis system in the event of a fault and 
corresponding fault code. 


1.2.4. D-CAN 

The D-CAN for the vehicle diagnosis has a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s. 

1.2.5. Ethernet 

The Ethernet access is used for programming the entire vehicle. 

In a F48 with navigation system the map update for the navigation can also be effected using the 
Ethernet interface. 


1.2.6. MOST 

In the F48 the Media Oriented System Transport (MOST) bus works at a data transfer rate of 
22.5 MBit/s. 

1.3. Sub-bus systems 

1.3.1. Local interconnect network bus 

Different data rates are used for the local interconnect network bus according to the information 
required. The data transfer rates of the local interconnect network bus in the F48 range from 19.2 kBit/ 
s to 20.0 kBit/s. 

Examples: 

• 19.2 kBit/s FLEL, FLER 

• 20.0 kBit/s remote control receiver 

The Body Domain Controller is designed for the different data rates at the corresponding inputs.

1. Vehicle Electrical System 

1.3.2. Local-CAN 

With corresponding optional equipment, the Local Controller Area Network connects the optional 
equipment system (SAS) with the control unit for the camera-based driver support systems (KAFAS). 

The Local Controller Area Network has a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s. 


1.3.3. USB 

Depending on the equipment, the following USB connections are possible: 

• from the headunit to the Telematic Communication Box (TCB) 

• from the headunit to the telephone base plate 

• from the headunit to the USB port

The intelligent battery sensor (IBS) records the following data of the battery: 

• Voltage 

• Current 

• Pole temperature 


The IBS performs the calculation and the evaluation of the information. The results are then forwarded 
to the superior control units via local interconnect network bus (DME and BDC). 


27 






F48 General Vehicle Electronics 

2. Voltage Supply 

The IBS has the same range of functions as with the predecessor models. The data transfer via the 
local interconnect network bus between the IBS, DEM and BDC is new. The IBS has a wake-up 
function. 

The IBS continuously records relevant values for the battery indicators when the vehicle is in rest 
state. These can be read out for the diagnosis in the DME/DDE. 

A 

The IBS is fully functional directly after installation at the battery terminal (screw connection at 
negative battery terminal and connection of signal lines), i.e. the basic variables voltage, current and 
temperature can be called up straight away. However, the variables deduced for power management 
(battery condition, starting capability, etc.) must be recalculated and are therefore available with a 
delay. 


2.2.3. Power distribution boxes 

Power distribution box, passenger compartment 

The power distribution box in the passenger compartment is located behind the glove box.

Functions 

The variable beam pattern offers improved adaptation of the beam pattern on the road situation. 
Depending on the speed driven, a distinction is made between the following beam patterns: 

• Cornering light 

• Adaptive headlight 


Cornering light 

The LED cornering light is integrated at the side in the headlight. During a slow journey (up to 45 km/h) 
the cornering light is either activated via the turn indicator or from a certain steering angle. 

Static adaptive headlight 

At speeds between 45 km/h and 70 km/h the cornering light is used as a "static Adaptive Headlight". 
The LEDs, which are responsible for the cornering light, are activated in order to illuminate the 
cornering area. This function is called a static Adaptive Headlight because the headlight is not moved.

F48 General Vehicle Electronics 

3. Exterior Lights 


Special features 

In vehicles with LED headlights a ride height sensor for the automatic headlight beam throw 
adjustment is installed at the front and rear axle on the right side of vehicle. 

For the F48 with LED headlight, a headlight cleaning system is not required. This could be waived due 
to compliance with all legal requirements. 

The Frontal Light Electronics Left and Right (FLEL/FLER) is installed at the rear side of the LED 
headlight and controls the following functions: 

• Low-beam headlight 

• High beam 

• Headlight flasher 

• Headlight beam angle adjustment 

• Cornering lights 

In addition, the FLE controls the temperature control in the LED headlight. The values of two 
temperature sensors at the heat sink serve as input signals. After switching off the lighting function an 
after-run of the fans of up to 60 seconds is possible. In the temperature control there is also a function 
for the de-icing of the LED headlight. 

In the case of a failure of a temperature sensor the fans are switched on at full power to protect the 
components in the LED headlight. The data from the FLE is transferred to the Body Domain Controller 
(BDC) via the local interconnect network bus for the diagnosis of the fans and temperature sensors. 

A 

For legal reasons (approval of light technology), the LED headlight obtains a forced connection for the 
rain-light-solar-condensation sensor.

5. Heating/Air Conditioning Systems 

Components 

Sensors and actuators which are connected to the Body Domain Controller (BDC) control unit are 
involved in the function of the heating and air-conditioning system in the F48: 

• Pressure sensor 

The BDC evaluates the pressure sensor signal and makes it available to the IHKA control unit 
via the K-CAN4. 

• Blower 

The IHKA request is sent via the LIN bus to the blower. 

• Air conditioning compressor 

The air conditioning compressor is controlled by the BDC by means of a pulse-width- 
modulated signal. The BDC can also actuate the air conditioning compressor clutch. 
However, the request is always made by the IHKA. 

• Automatic air recirculation control sensor 

The automatic air recirculation control sensor is read by the BDC via a local interconnect 
network bus. The IHKA assumes the automatic air flap control, which communicates 
with the BDC via K-CAN4. 

• Rain-light-solar-condensation sensor (RLSBS) 

The rain-light-solar-condensation sensor communicates with the BDC via a 
local interconnect network bus.

6.2. Central locking system 

The function of the central locking system of the F48 is based on that of current BMW models. 
With the introduction of the BDC, all relevant functions for the central locking system are handled 
by one control unit. The function is as follows: 

• The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the remote control receiver. 

• The signal causes the BDC to activate the central locking system and the interior lighting. 

• The BDC evaluates the status of all door contacts. In this way, for example, the vehicle can 
be prevented from being locked while the driver's door is open. 

• The status of the central locking system button is also evaluated by the BDC. 

The BDC activates the central locking system, depending on the status. 

• The BDC is responsible for the status recording and activation of the central 
locking system in the tailgate.

6. Locking and Security Functions 

6.2.1. Special functions 

Automatic locking (Personal Profile) 

From a speed greater than 16 km/h the vehicle is automatically locked. 

A_ 

Different functions of the central locking system can be individually adjusted via the 
central information display. 


Automatic unlocking in the event of a crash 

As soon as the Body Domain Controller (BDC) receives a crash message from the Advanced Crash 
Safety Module (ACSM), the vehicle is unlocked. 

After the crash message, the central locking button and the remote control receiver are blocked for 
the central locking system function. Both are only reactivated after a terminal change. 

Selective unlocking 

The vehicle can also be selectively unlocked in the case of corresponding encoding. Initially, only 
the driver's door is unlocked. The rest of the vehicle is unlocked upon a subsequent request for 
unlocking. Depending on the operating point and the national-market version, the fuel filler flap is 
already unlocked after the first or second request. 

Convenient opening 

By operating the remote control button "Unlock" for approximately 3 seconds the convenient opening 
can start. The windows and, if installed the panorama glass roof (SA 402), are opened in the process. 
The button on the remote key must be held down until the process is complete. 

Convenient closing 

By operating the remote control button "Lock" for approximately 3 seconds the convenient closing 
can start. The windows and, if installed the panorama glass roof (SA 402), are closed in the process. 
The button on the remote key must be held down until the process is complete. 

If the vehicle has the optional equipment Comfort Access (SA 322), the windows and the panorama 
glass roof (SA 402) can be closed by pressing the grooved surface on the outer door handle.

The two sensors are connected to the evaluation electronics and constantly measure the capacity. 

A comparison of the time characteristic of the measured capacities permits the identification of a 
certain movement pattern. 

A targeted foot movement to and from the bumper can be detected herefrom. The top sensor detects 
the shin, the bottom sensor the toes. 

The detection range is between the rear lights. 

The sensors are secured in the inside of the rear bumper. 

The evaluation electronics evaluate the signals from the sensors and make this information available 
to the BDC via the local interconnect network bus. If there is a valid ID transmitter near the Comfort 
Access antenna in the rear bumper, the BDC initiates an opening of the tailgate. 

The tailgate opens regardless if it was locked or unlocked. 

The tailgate of the F48 can also be closed again using the same foot movement as for opening. 

With the closing of the tailgate via the non-contact tailgate activation, a sound is output by an acoustic 
warning device, which is installed in the tailgate.

The alarm system in the F48 is optional equipment (SA 302). 

The alarm system in the F48 is equipped with an ultrasonic interior movement detector for monitoring 
the passenger compartment. The ultrasonic interior movement detector (USIS) is fully integrated in 
the roof function center (FZD). 

The door contacts, engine compartment lid switch and the opening of the tailgate are monitored by 
the Body Domain Controller. As soon as a status changes, the ultrasonic interior movement detector 
receives this information via the K-CAN2. In the event of an activated alarm system a siren with tilt 
alarm sensor is activated by the control unit in the event of a break-in. 

The SINE is connected to the roof function center via a local interconnect network bus. 

A 

By operating the central locking button on the remote key twice, the tilt sensor and the interior 
movement detector are deactivated up to the next unlocking process. 


The status of the alarm system is displayed via the LED at the interior mirror.
