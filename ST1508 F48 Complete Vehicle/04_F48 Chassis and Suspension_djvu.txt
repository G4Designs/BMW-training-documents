1.1. Longitudinal and cornering forces at the wheel 

The wheels at the vehicle must transmit longitudinal and cornering forces via the tire contact areas. 
The following graphic shows the connection between the driving power and the cornering force at 
the wheel.

1. Introduction 


The area shown in white corresponds to the maximum available overall force, which the wheel can 
transmit to the roadway. The maximum overall force is influenced by the properties of the tire, the road 
condition and the vertical wheel force. If, for example, the coefficient of friction between the wheel and 
the roadway decreases due to wet conditions, the available overall force is reduced. 

The resulting force of driving power and cornering force cannot exceed the maximum overall force. 

If the resulting force is too high, the wheel loses adhesion and puts the vehicle in an unstable driving 
condition. If the driving power increases, a lower cornering force is available. The opposite is also true, 
meaning that the maximum driving power is only possible for straight-ahead driving. 

In contrast to vehicles with a rear-wheel drive, the front wheels of XI vehicles also have to absorb the 
driving powers, in addition to the steering forces. Hence why an uneven axle-load distribution, with a 
higher axle load at the front axle, is desired in vehicles with a front-wheel drive. 

The vertical wheel force is thus increased and also the maximum available overall force. 

In the new BMW XI xDrive28i, the axle load at the front axle is approximately 56 %.

All components of the single-joint spring-strut-type front axle of the F48 have been fully redeveloped. 
Excellent axle kinematics, as well as high rigidity, ensure agile single-joint movement and a precise 
steering sensation, to a large extent without engine influences. 

The friction-optimized wheel bearing ensures a reduction in the fuel consumption. 

Within the framework of the modular principle, the front axle in the F48 is also designed for use in 
vehicles with other track widths.

The use of aluminium (swivel bearing) and high-strength steels (front axle support, wishbone) reduces 
the unsprung masses. 


Engine and transmission mounts absorb the weight of the respective drive components and together 
with the engine anti-roll bar link support the engine torque. The rear wishbone rubber mounts are 
designed as hydro mounts.

The kingpin offset is the distance from the intersection point of the axis of movement with the roadway 
to the center of the wheel contact face. In the F48 negative kingpin offsets are used, in order to 
counteract the yaw moment around the vertical vehicle axis in the case of braking with only one brake 
circuit.

In the F48 a diagonal dual-circuit brake system (X-split) is used. One of the wheels of the front axle 
and one of the wheels of the rear axle, which are located diagonally opposite, are each supplied by one 
brake circuit. In the event of a failure of a brake circuit, the vehicle is thus decelerated at the front axle 
only via one wheel. 


7 















F48 Chassis and Suspension 

2. Front Axle 


However, a yaw moment around the vertical vehicle axis (M 2 ) occurs as a consequence, by the one¬ 
sided deceleration of the wheels at the front and rear axle. In order to guarantee sufficient driving 
stability in this case, a negative kingpin offset is used in the F48. As a result, in the event of braking 
with only one brake circuit a torque is generated at the wheel (M-|), which counteracts the yaw moment 
around the vertical vehicle axis (M 2 ).

In the F48 a space-saving, modular central link rear axle is used. The axle principle is particularly 
suitable for the dynamic handling characteristics of the vehicle. It also offers very good conditions for 
the integration of the xDrive. All components of the rear axle were newly developed. The targeted use 
of high-strength steels, as well as the increased rigidity of the wheel suspension parts, form the basis 
for the unique driving dynamics in this class of vehicle.

Less space is required in the wheel arch thanks to the separate arrangement of shock absorbers and 
coil springs. This results in a generous spatial offering and a high level of entry comfort for the rear 
seat passengers, as well as excellent use of the luggage compartment. 

The friction-optimized wheel bearings reduce the fuel consumption. 

Within the framework of the modular principle, the rear axle in the F48 is also designed for use in 
vehicles with other track widths.

In the F48 a diagonal dual-circuit brake system (X-split) is used. One of the wheels of the front axle and 
one of the wheels of the rear axle, which are located diagonally opposite, are supplied by one brake 
circuit. In the event of a failure of a brake circuit, a braked front wheel is always available. 

As a result, the prescribed minimum deceleration is achieved in the event of a failure of a brake circuit 
despite a low rear axle load. 


14 























F48 Chassis and Suspension 

4. Brake 


However, a yaw moment occurs around the vertical vehicle axis in the case of braking with only one 
brake circuit, because one braked front wheel transmits significantly higher brake forces than the rear 
wheel braked on the other side of vehicle. 

In order to guarantee sufficient driving stability, a negative kingpin offset is therefore used in the F48. 


4.1. Electromechanical parking brake 

The activation of the EMF is also performed in the F48 via the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). 
A separate control unit could therefore be dispensed with.

5. Dynamic Damper Control 

A Dynamic Damper Controller (SA 223) is available as optional equipment for the F48. With this 
system the customer can adjust the characteristics of the vehicle to a tighter, more agile setting. 

The chassis and suspension is effected manually in two stages. The system manages without 
sensors. In addition, the different suspensions are more noticeable by the customer.

5.2. Operation and function 

The characteristics of the shock absorbers can be adapted in two stages using the driving experience 
switch: 


• COMFORT and ECO PRO: NORMAL suspension 

• SPORT: SPORT suspension (configurable*). 

* In SPORT mode there is the option to give the drive train and the chassis and suspension 
components a sporty dimension independent of each other. 

The Body Domain Controller detects the position of the driving experience switch and transmits this 
information via FlexRay to the optional equipment system (SAS). 

From a speed of 4 km/h the optional equipment system (SAS) checks the position of the driving 
experience switch and activates the shock absorbers accordingly. At vehicle standstill the shock 
absorbers are not activated. In the basic setting the shock absorbers are in the SPORT suspension 
setting. They change to NORMAL suspension setting upon activation.

Sport valve 


A normal valve and sport valve are located in the working piston of the shock absorber. The flow 
channel through the normal valve can be enabled with a solenoid valve. 

5.2.1. NORMAL suspension 

In the upper area of the working piston there is a solenoid with a solenoid coil and ferromagnetic core. 
With the activation of the solenoid the round slider lying underneath is pulled upwards and the flow 
channel is enabled through the normal valve. 

The oil flow through the working piston is directed through the sport valve and the normal valve. 

5.2.2. SPORT suspension 

If the solenoid is not activated, a coil spring pushes the control edge of the round slider onto the valve 
seat of the normal valve. The oil flow through the normal valve is thus interrupted. The oil flow through 
the working piston is only directed through the sport valve.

5.4. Notes for Service 

The dynamic damper control is capable of self-diagnosis and if necessary can input a fault in the 
fault memory. 

As the suspension is always in Sport mode at vehicle standstill, the shock absorbers can also be 
activated with help of the diagnosis system using the "Component activation" function. 

A 

Risk of damage! 

In the event of improper repair work, the shock absorbers or their plug connections may incur damage. 
It is imperative the current repair instructions are observed when working at the Dynamic Damper 
Control.

According to an US regulation, car manufacturers have to equip their models introduced on the market 
since 2012 with a system for monitoring the tire pressure, which warns the driver of too little air in the 
tires. From 2014 all new vehicles must already have this technology. 


24 
















































F48 Chassis and Suspension 
6. Tire Pressure Monitoring System 

In the F48 the tire pressure monitoring are standard equipment. TPMS is a system which monitors the 
tire pressures. The function is integrated in the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), whereby no separate 
TPMS control unit is required. 

In each of the four mounted wheels there is wheel electronics, which record the tire pressure and the 
temperature in the tires. The wheel electronics send this information with radio signals to the remote 
control receiver. The remote control receiver forwards this information via the BDC to the DSC with 
help of the vehicle electrical system. The evaluation function of the information takes place in the 
DSC control unit. 

The tire pressures are displayed via the central information display. Warnings due to insufficient tire 
pressure are output via the central information display or instrument cluster. 


6.1. Notes for Service 

The service life of the batteries of the wheel electronics is roughly 10 years or 300,000 km. Before 
each tire change the battery status of the wheel electronics should be determined using the diagnosis 
system, as it is not possible to check when the tires are mounted. If the remaining service life of the 
tires exceeds that of the battery, the wheel electronics must also be replaced.

The lower and upper steering shafts can be telescoped together. This protects the driver against 
severe injuries in the event of a frontal crash. With the mechanical steering column adjustment the

The 12V steering has a maximum assistance output of 0.3 kW. The steering assistance takes place 
via the EPS unit parallel to the input shaft. The electric motor transmits the requested steering 
assistance to the pinion shaft via the worm drive. The steering system thus works with particularly 
low friction. 


28 





















F48 Chassis and Suspension 

7. Steering 


The EPS unit is made up of the following components: 

• EPS control unit 

• Three-phase electric motor 

• Inverter for converting the 12V direct current voltage to three-phase 
AC voltage, for the activation of the electric motor 

In addition to the input shaft, there is housing ventilation. The formation of condensate is thus 
prevented due to alternating temperatures. 

The individual components that can be replaced individually in Service at the EPS are the gaiters, the 
track rods and the track rod ends. It is not possible to exchange the EPS control unit or the electric 
motor separately. 

The EPS is a prerequisite for implementation of the Parking Maneuver Assistant (PMA). 

The Variable sport steering (SA 2VL) known from current BMW models is also available as an option. 


7.1. Steering angle 

The steering angle in the F48 is not recorded by a separate sensor at the steering wheel, but by the 
EPS control unit. It evaluates the signals of a rotor position sensor in the electric motor of the EPS unit. 

The following values are stored in the EPS control unit for the purpose of determining the steering 
angle: 

• Geometrical center of rack 

• Straight-ahead value 

• Number of rotor revolutions 


7.1.1. Geometrical center of rack 

The geometrical center of the rack is stored in the EPS control unit by the steering manufacturer 
(Nexteer) during installation and cannot be changed. 

7.1.2. Straight-ahead value 

Depending on the size of the production tolerance, the straight-ahead value deviates by a few degrees 
from the geometric center of the rack. It must be taught in again after the installation of the steering 
or after every removal of the steering mounting bolts. This can be effected with help of the diagnosis 
system via the service function "Commissioning". 

Once stored, the straight-ahead value will not be deleted if the vehicle voltage is lost and can be 
overwritten as often as is required.

F48 Chassis and Suspension 

7. Steering 

7.1.3. Number of rotor revolutions 

In order to be able to calculate the position of the steering shaft, the revolutions of the rotor in the 
electric motor of the EPS unit must be continuously counted after the straight-ahead value is stored. 
In the event of a loss of the voltage supply, this value is lost and must be taught in again. 

The number of rotor revolutions or the steering angle can be determined by two different teach-in 
routines: 

• Static 

Turn steering wheel when ignition is switched on from the steering wheel center position to 
the limit position at the right, to the limit position at the left and back again to the steering 
wheel center position. 

• Dynamic 

1. Rough value: The steering angle is calculated based on a short straight-ahead driving 
route at a driving speed of < 18 km/h with a precision of +/- 30° (approximately 2 
revolutions of the rotor). 

2. Precise value: The steering angle is determined on a short straight-ahead driving route 
at a driving speed of < 60 km/h with a precision of +/- 7.5°. 

With static teaching of the steering angle, the revolutions of the rotor are counted by the EPS control 
unit and stored. 

With dynamic teaching of the steering angle, the wheel speeds of the wheels on the rear axle, the yaw 
rate and the lateral acceleration are evaluated. If these values are within the stored tolerances over a 
short distance travelled, the steering angle is saved in the EPS control unit. 

The steering angle is, however, also an important variable for calculating a wide range of DSC 
functions. For this reason the EPS control unit sends the steering angle information via FlexRay 
to the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). 

If it was not possible to determine the steering angle to the required degree of accuracy, the DSC 
indicator and warning light is activated if the driving speed of 12 to 37 mph is exceeded. This tells the 
driver that the various DSC functions are only operational to a limited extent. If the steering angle is 
determined dynamically during the course of the journey, the DSC functions are available again. This 
could, for example, occur if a customer has replaced the battery and exits the speed range of 12 to 37 
mph too quickly.

7.3. Notes for Service 

To relieve the load on the battery, the vehicle is delivered in transport mode. This means that the 
steering angle is not stored in the EPS control unit and must be set up again by the Service personnel 
with the assistance of the teach-in routine. 

The EPS steering has a voltage range of between 9 V and 16 V. If a fault occurs which causes a drop 
in the supply voltage (up to 9 V, the current level is increased to compensate for the loss of power. To 
protect the system, the steering assistance is switched off if the supply voltage is less than 9 V 
or higher than 16 V. 

System faults with the EPS are shown by the steering indicator and warning light in the instrument 
cluster. 

Possible causes for the illumination of the indicator and warning light: 

• Fault in the EPS control unit, an integrated sensor or in the electric motor 

• Software error in the EPS control unit 

• Over temperature threshold of EPS has been reached 

• Under voltage or over voltage protection level reached 

• Malfunction of external signals affecting the steering assistance 

• Steering angle not taught in correctly or completely 


A 

If the EPS has been replaced or its mounting bolts have been undone, the "Start-up" service function 
must be run with the assistance of the diagnosis system. 

If the 12V supply voltage to the EPS is lost, and upon deactivation of transport mode, the steering 
angle must be taught in statically or dynamically. 

If the steering angle could not be calculated, the DSC functions are only available to a limited extent.

The Dynamic Stability Control forms the core of the vehicle control systems that enhance active 
safety. It optimizes driving stability in all driving conditions and also traction when driving off 
and accelerating. Furthermore, it identifies unstable driving conditions such as understeering or 
oversteering and helps maintain the vehicle on a steady course. 

The DSC unit is made up of the DSC control unit and the DSC hydraulic control unit with electric 
motor. The DSC control unit is connected to the DSC hydraulic control unit using three screws 
and can be replaced separately in Service.

8.2.1. Electromechanical parking brake 

Dynamic emergency braking 

The law requires that there are two operating facilities for the brakes. In the F48 the second operating 
unit after the brake pedal is the parking brake button in the center console. If the parking brake button 
is pulled up while the vehicle is moving, the DSC system performs a dynamic emergency braking 
operation in a defined sequence. This function is intended for emergency situations in which the driver 
is not able to brake the vehicle using the brake pedal. Other occupants can also bring the vehicle to a 
standstill in this way if, for example, the driver suddenly falls unconscious. 

If the parking brake button is operated during the journey above a defined driving speed, the DSC unit 
initiates a dynamic emergency braking operation. During dynamic emergency braking, brake pressure 
is generated hydraulically at all four wheel brakes. The DSC functions are fully active and the brake 
lights are operated. The slip of all wheels are monitored to ensure a stable braking operation until the 
vehicle comes to a standstill. The two actuators of the electromechanical parking brake are activated 
as soon as the vehicle comes to a standstill. Now only the parking brake secures the vehicle to prevent 
it from rolling away.

Brake test stand 

The F48 has a test stand mode for checking the braking power of the electromechanical parking 
brake on a brake test stand. When the test stand mode is activated, the vehicle is decelerated via the 
actuators of the electromechanical parking brake when the parking brake button is pressed. A DSC 
pressure build-up in all four wheel brakes does not occur. This makes it possible to determine the 
brake forces of the electromechanical parking brake. 

In the F48 test stand mode is automatically detected by means of a plausibility check (wheel speed 
comparison). The detection lasts a maximum of 5 seconds (can be recognized by slow flashing of the 
red parking brake indicator light). 

After activation of test stand mode the system is in test stand mode. The parking brake indicator light 
acknowledges this status by flashing at a frequency of 1 hertz. Using the parking brake button the 
EMF can be applied in five stages. In this case, the braking varies between the minimum braking power 
in the first stage and the maximum braking power once the parking brake button has been pressed five 
times. If the button is operated continuously, the system increases the braking power automatically 
incrementally up to the maximum braking power. The flashing frequency of the parking brake indicator 
light changes from 1 hertz to 3 hertz when the parking brake button is pressed in test stand mode. 

Automatic release 

For automatic release, step on the accelerator pedal. The LED and indicator lamp go out. The parking 
brake is automatically released when you step on the accelerator if the following applies: 

• Engine on 

• Drive mode engaged 

• Driver buckled in and doors closed 


8.2.2. Hill Descent Control 

Hill Descent Control is a downhill driving assistant that automatically controls vehicle speed on steep 
downhill gradients. Without applying the brakes, the vehicle moves at slightly more than walking 
speed. Hill Descent Control can be activated at speeds below approximately 22 mph. 

When driving downhill, the vehicle reduces its speed to approximately walking speed and then keeps 
its speed constant. As long as there is active braking, the system is on standby. The system does not 
brake the vehicle during this time. 

Only use HDC in low gears or in selector lever position D or R.

Increasing or decreasing vehicle speed 

Specify desired speed in the range from approximately 4 mph to approximately 15 mph using the 
rocker switch of the cruise control on the steering wheel. Vehicle speed can be changed by lightly 
accelerating. 

• Press the rocker switch up to the point of resistance: the speed increases gradually. 

• Press up the rocker switch past the point of resistance: the speed increases while the rocker 
switch is pressed. 

• Press the rocker switch down to the point of resistance: the speed decreases gradually. 

• Press the rocker switch down past the point of resistance: when driving forward, the speed 
decreases to approximately 6 mph/10 km/h; when reversing, the speed decreases to 
approximately 4 mph. 

Vehicle speed can be changed by lightly accelerating.
