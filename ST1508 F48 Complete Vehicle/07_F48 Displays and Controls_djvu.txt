Information status and national-market versions 

BMW Group vehicles meet the requirements of the highest safety and quality standards. Changes 
in requirements for environmental protection, customer benefits and design render necessary 
continuous development of systems and components. Consequently, there may be discrepancies 
between the contents of this document and the vehicles available in the training course. 

This document basically relates to the European version of left-hand drive vehicles. Some operating 
elements or components are arranged differently in right-hand drive vehicles than shown in the 
graphics in this document. Further differences may arise as a result of the equipment specification in 
specific markets or countries.

F48 Displays and Controls 

1. System Overview 


Similar to other BMW models, the operating concept of the F48 is designed for clear and optimal 
structuring of the cockpit. This is achieved primarily through the simplified and logical operation, 
as well as the clear arrangement of the display and operating elements.

3. Head-Up Display 

The Head-Up Display (SA610) projects a virtual image into the driver's field of view. The driver thus 
always has important information such as the driving speed and Check Control messages directly in 
his field of view. 

The HUD in the F48 can project the colors red, green and blue. Contents can be displayed in all colors 
of the RGB color spectrum, as is the case with an LCD monitor, by mixing the three colors. 

The Head-Up Display (HUD) for the F48 is not connected to a CAN bus, but is connected directly to 
the instrument cluster via an Automotive Pixel Link interface. Fault code entries are entered in the 
instrument cluster. 


3.1. Functional principle 

The HUD is similar to a projector. A light source is required to project the HUD information. Two white 
LEDs serve as the light source. The light is directed through a lens onto a TFT projection display 
where the screen contents are displayed. The TFT projection display can be compared to a filter which 
admits or blocks light. 

An optical imaging element determines the shape, distance and size of the HUD images.

Projected image 


The image appears to float freely over the roadway, projected on the windshield. 

The windshield is a "special pane" and important element in the projection of the displays. 

The outer and inner glass panes are bonded to a plastic film, just like in the standard windshield. 
However, unlike in the standard windshield, this plastic film is not parallel but is tapered over the entire 
area of the windshield. 

The head-up display is fitted above the steering column, immediately behind the instrument cluster. 

It is secured to the bulkhead supporting structure using three screws.

4. Central Information Display 

Depending on the equipment installed, two different versions of a central information display are 
installed in the F48. 

The CID in the F48 is directly connected to the headunit via an Automotive Pixel Link interface. 
Fault code entries are stored in the headunit.

5.1. Overview 


Depending on equipment, the F48 has two different controllers with direct access keys: 

• 7-button 

• Touch controller 

The controller variants based on the different optional equipment can be found in the following table:

5.2. Touch Controller 

Vehicles with the optional equipment Navigation Plus (SA 6UP) have a controller with touch control 
panel. 

In the Touch Controller the customer can input location information for the navigation system or 
telephone numbers and contact details. In the interactive map, the map section, for example, 
can be moved and enlarged or reduced by finger movement. 

The input of characters with the wordmatch principle is detected at an angle of 45°.

The Touchbox control unit is required for interpreting the contact sensors of the Touch Controller for 
the Headunit High user interface. The Touchbox is connected to the Touch Controller and headunit via 
the K-CAN4.

6.1. Modes 

The following program can be selected for the F48: 

• SPORT 

• COMFORT 

• ECO PRO 

6.1.1. SPORT mode 

In SPORT mode the accelerator pedal characteristic curve in the throttle and the shifting points 
in vehicles with an automatic transmission have a sporty design. If the vehicle has the optional 
equipment Dynamic Damper Control (SA 223), the corresponding chassis components also have a 
sporty design. 

6.1.2. COMFORT mode 

COMFORT mode is the "normal" mode of the vehicle. COMFORT mode is active upon every engine 
start, regardless of the mode in which the parked vehicle was previously. 

6.1.3. ECO PRO mode 

The ECO PRO mode supports the driver in adopting an optimized-consumption driving style and 
reduces fuel consumption through intelligent control of energy and A/C management. The number 
and length of the automatic engine start/stop function phases are maximized in ECO PRO mode.

7. Intelligent Safety Button 

Using the Intelligent Safety button, certain assistance systems of the F48 can be activated, 
deactivated and individualized. 

In the F48, the Intelligent Safety button is only installed with the optional equipment Driving Assistant 
(SA 5AS). A description of the optional equipment Driving Assistant (SA 5AS) can be found in the 
section "F48 Driver Assistance Systems". 

The Intelligent Safety button together with the hazard warning switch is located below the central 
information display (CID).
