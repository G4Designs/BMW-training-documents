F48 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 


The assistance systems facilitate driving of the vehicle by: 

• providing the driver with information 

• giving the driver suggestions or 

• automatically intervening in the driving process. 

This product information bulletin provides an overview of the assistance systems which are new or 
whose function has been modified: 

• Collision warning with city braking function 

• Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

• Road sign recognition including no overtaking display 

• Park Distance Control 

• Parking Maneuver Assistant 

• Rear view camera 

• Cruise control 

In the F48, a lot of the optional equipment known from other BMW models is still only available in 
conjunction with optional equipment packages Driving Assistant (SA 5AS) or Driving Assistant Plus 
(SA 5AT). The following table shows which systems are included in the different optional equipment 
packages:

2. KAFAS 


The recognition of road users driving ahead and the detection of pedestrians are among the most 
important functions to be satisfied by assistance systems. This function must be satisfied at both long 
distance and close range. The functions in the F48 have been implemented in optionally available 
combinations as camera-based systems using a shared camera and shared control unit. 

The KAFAS camera and KAFAS control unit therefore constitute the central element of the following 
assistance systems: 

• Collision warning with city braking function 

• Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

• Road sign recognition 

• Lane departure warning 

• Camera-based cruise control 


2.1. Person recognition

The person recognition in the F48 only takes place with the help of the camera-based driver support 
system. A radar sensor is not offered in the F48, unlike in other BMW models.

KAFAS camera 


The KAFAS camera captures the scene in front of the vehicle and detects entire rear views of moving 
and stationary vehicles in the field of view using machine vision. The KAFAS camera also ensures that 
driving lane information, vehicle positions and movements are determined at the same time. 

With the aid of the image data from the KAFAS camera, objects can be clearly identified as vehicles 
and corresponding transverse movements as lane changes.

Example of functional limitation by backlight 


A 

The function of the KAFAS camera and thus also the function of the corresponding assistance 
systems may be impaired in the following situations, for example: 

• heavy fog, rain, rain spray or snow 

• strong backlight 

• if the field of view of the KAFAS camera or the windscreen is dirty or covered 

• at sharp bends 

• up to 10 seconds after the engine start via the START-STOP button 

• during the calibration process for the KAFAS camera immediately after 
vehicle delivery or a camera change

3. Road Sign Recognition 

With the road sign recognition function, current top speed limitations can be displayed in the 
instrument cluster and, if applicable, also in the Head-Up Display, in order to avoid possible excess 
speed. 

The road sign recognition is an element of the optional equipment Driving Assistant (SA 5AS). 
Depending on the equipment, the function of the road sign recognition may vary: 

• Road sign recognition with navigation system 

• Road sign recognition without navigation system 


A 

The responsibility for the vehicle and the speed driven lies solely with the driver. 


3.1. Operation 

The road sign recognition can be switched on and off using a controller. For this purpose, select the 
following: 

1 Settings 

2 Instrument cluster 

3 Road sign recognition 

If the road sign recognition is switched on, the information recorded is shown in the instrument cluster. 
If a speed limitation symbol with three horizontal lines is displayed in the instrument cluster instead of 
the max. permissible speed, then the road sign recognition is not available (e.g. in non-mapped areas 
such as underground car parks and car parks). 


3.2. Function 

In the F48, the road sign recognition can be ordered from BMW by the customer for the first time 
without the connection to a navigation system. This also makes it possible to offer the function in 
countries which had to waive this function due to missing navigation data.

3. Road Sign Recognition 

3.2.1. Road sign recognition with navigation system 

The control unit for the road sign recognition function is the KAFAS control unit. 

In addition, the detected top speed limitation is compared using data from the navigation system, 
in order to avoid incorrect displays and to display a top speed limitation on unmarked roads. 

If data on the top speed limitations relating to the current road is stored in the navigation system, 
this is used by the KAFAS control unit and forms the basis of a possible display for the driver. 

Traffic signs containing supplementary information, e.g. "In wet conditions", or symbols are also 
detected and synchronised with internal vehicle data, e.g. the rain sensor, and displayed depending on 
the situation. The system also takes the applicable time restrictions which have been identified, e.g. 
"between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am" into account. Flere the current time of the on-board clock and the 
time from the navigation map are used. 

At the same time, the video data from the centrally arranged KAFAS camera which points forward is 
also evaluated in the KAFAS control unit. 

The image data is read by the KAFAS control unit and evaluated for traffic signs relating to speed 
limitations and withdrawal of speed limitations. 

In the case of concealed and non-recognizable signs on the withdrawal of top speed limitations, 
the displays are cancelled according to the specified time and distance parameters. 

In addition to image data, other information from the vehicle electrical system is also used in the 
evaluation and calculation for the display: 

• Time display (for temporal additional conditions) 

• Status of wiper (for additional sign "In wet conditions") 

• Turn indicator signal (special speed limit, e.g. on motorway exits) 

• Status of outside temperature sensor in "Frost/Snow" 

The basis of this diverse information leads to relatively high precision of this function in the evaluation.

Displays of road sign recognition during an active navigation display

Displays in standard view 


Traffic signs for speed limits and for no overtaking, which do not correspond to the legal standard, 
in particular those without a circular frame, are not always recognized. The same also applies for traffic 
signs which are fully or partially covered by labels, dirt or vegetation. 

Long distances to the road sign, high driving speeds and poor weather conditions, particularly at night, 
make it more difficult for the system to recognise road signs reliably. 

The data from the navigation map must be up-to-date for the correct display of the current speed limit 
and no overtaking sign. If the current location for the navigation is not yet taken into consideration, for 
example when driving in development areas, on new roads or on roads with modified road layout, a 
recognized traffic sign for speed limits or for no overtaking can only be displayed for roughly the next 
500 m.

3. Road Sign Recognition 

3.3. Limits of the system 

Traffic signs on parallel, forking or emerging roads 

Parallel roads are not recognized with the KAFAS camera or using the navigation map. Signs on these 
roads can be recognized and displayed as speed limits or no overtaking for the current road. Speed 
limits and no passing signs for forking or emerging roads are generally also assumed and displayed for 
the current road. 

Traffic signs at exits 

Speed limits for exits off highway with or without an arrow as an additional character are generally 
evaluated correctly and suppressed in the display if driven past. This is only the case if the data on the 
navigation map is up-to-date. 

In the case of sign gantries on the highway with different, lane-dependent speed limits, the speed limit 
which is closest to the lane of the vehicle is displayed. There is no adaptation of the display after a later 
lane change. 

Information signs in the road sign surroundings 

Information signs with speed limits or no overtaking, such as at border crossing points with 
information on the different legal speed limits for national roads and highway, may be incorrectly 
recognized as currently valid and displayed. The same applies to information signs with different color 
configurations, e.g. for minimum or recommended speeds. 

Stickers on vehicles 

Labels with a speed limit on vehicles ahead or overtaken, such as trucks, buses, trailers or 
construction machinery, etc., may be incorrectly recognized as a currently valid speed limit and 
displayed. 

Town/city limits 

If the sign for the entrance to a village/town is not clearly recognized (detection is only possible in 
Germany) and the data from the navigation map is not up-to-date, the speed limit at the entrances 
to and exits from villages/towns may be displayed incorrectly. 

Legal changes 

If legally prescribed maximum speeds change, then these are only available after a map data update. 
Up until the update the original, but no longer valid speed limits are displayed. 

General no passing signs 

No overtaking signs are only displayed if these are also signs posted. General no overtaking, 
which applies for example at level crossings or is marked by a white line on the roadway, is not 
displayed without an additional sign.

4. Camera-based Collision Warning 

The collision warning warns the driver of a possible risk of collision and is recognized in the F48 using 
the KAFAS system. The camera-based collision warning includes the following functions: 

• Collision warning with city braking function 

• Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

The collision warning with city braking function is already included in the standard equipment of the 
F48. The pedestrian warning with city braking function is an element of the optional equipment Driving 
Assistant (SA 5AS). 

The system can warn the driver in situations where a collision is imminent. The early warning, 
a visual signal, is issued first to draw the driver's attention to the situation. If the situation becomes 
more critical, an acute warning in the form of a visual and acoustic signal is issued. The nature of 
the warning is such that the driver can still prevent a collision providing he acts quickly. If there is no 
reaction from the driver after an acute warning, the driver is supported with automatic braking of the 
vehicle (5-85 km/h). 


4.1. Collision warning with city braking function 


4.1.1. Functional principle 

The corresponding warning stages "early warning" and "acute warning" are output in critical situations 
on the basis of the calculated positions, distances and relative speeds of other vehicles. For the early 
warning and acute warning, the brakes of the vehicle are prepared for emergency braking, depending 
on the actual speed, and the activation thresholds of the brake assistant are reduced.

12 



F48 Driver Assistance Systems 

4. Camera-based Collision Warning 

4.1.2. Early warning 

The early warning works from a speed of approximately 15 km/h. 

The early warning is issued, for example, if there is a danger of collision because the vehicle driving 
ahead is being driven at a much slower speed and/or if the distance to a vehicle ahead is extremely 
short. 

The early warning is indicated by a vehicle symbol which lights up red in the instrument cluster. 

The early warning can be configured using the controller ("early", "middle" or "late"). The "late" 
setting corresponds to a deactivated early warning, for this reason, only the acute warning is active 
for an immediate risk of collision due to a high differential speed. 

A 

The collision warning is dependent on the vehicle's own driving speed. The distance measured for the 
collision warning is significantly lower than the legally required minimum distance. It is therefore the 
responsibility of the driver to adhere to the legal minimum distance. 


4.1.3. Acute warning 

The acute warning works from a speed of approximately 15 km/h and is issued by the system as late 
as possible and only if there is an imminent danger of a collision when the vehicle is approaching 
the vehicle driving ahead at a relatively high differential speed or if there is an imminent danger of a 
collision with a pedestrian. The time of the acute warning is measured so that a collision can only be 
avoided by immediate emergency braking or by swerving. The acute warning can therefore not be 
introduced or controlled intentionally. 

If the vehicle is, for example, approaching the vehicle driving ahead at very low speed, or is 
approaching a person, an acute warning is not issued even when the distance is very small. 

This intentional driving situation only triggers the early warning. This way there are fewer meaningless 
and annoying acute warnings issued by the system. 

The acute warning cannot be deactivated. The time for the acute warning also cannot be adjusted. 

If the acute warning is not to be issued, the "collision warning" front protective function must be 
deactivated. 

The acute warning issues a prompt for intervention and is supported if there is a danger of collision 
by a two-stage intervention. Brake preconditioning is only effected after the driver warning. 

A_ _ 

The acute warning does not relieve the driver of his responsibility to adapt the speed and driving style 
to the traffic conditions and adhere to the prescribed safety distance.

5 

Detection range of KAFAS camera 


4.1.4. Braking function 

The collision warning with city braking function is active from 5-85 km/h. This way the severity of 
collisions should be reduced through automatic brake intervention up to 85 km/h. With the braking 
function an accident up to approximately 20 km/h differential speed can be prevented. In the case of 
a greater differential speed the accident severity can be reduced. 

If there is still no response from the driver in this speed range (approximately 5-85 km/h) after an 
acute warning, the vehicle is decelerated at approximately 4 m/s 2 . 

The brake intervention is restricted to approximately 1.5 seconds. Additional dangers for the traffic 
behind are therefore avoided. 

The brake intervention is only effected when the Dynamic Stability Control is switched on.

4.2. Pedestrian warning with city braking function 

The system warns the driver of possible collisions with pedestrians in the 10 and 60 km/h range and 
can thus reduce the results of an accident or prevent accidents. In addition, braking is automatically 
introduced. 

The pedestrian warning with city braking function is based on the collision warning with braking 
function. It detects critical situations in which pedestrians cross the path of the vehicle. In the warning 
stage (acute warning), a pedestrian symbol is displayed in the instrument cluster and an acoustic 
warning is also issued. The warning stage can be switched on or off using the Intelligent Safety button. 
The function is always available upon an engine start. 

The KAFAS camera captures the scene in front of the vehicle and detects pedestrians in the field of 
view using machine vision. Based on the calculated positions, distances and the movement of the 
detected pedestrians, an acute warning is issued in critical situations and the vehicle is decelerated 
at approximately 4 m/s 2 . 

The brake intervention is restricted to approximately 1.5 seconds. Additional dangers for the traffic 
behind are therefore avoided. 

An early warning is not available for the pedestrian warning with city braking function. 

The brake intervention is only performed when the Dynamic Stability Control is switched on.

4.6. Limits of the system 

A 

The collision warning has a limited capacity for detection. As a result, incorrect or delayed warnings 
may occur. 

It is possible the following vehicles are not detected: 

• a slower vehicle when driving off at high speed 

• sudden swerving or heavy decelerating vehicles 

• vehicles with an unusual rear view or with insufficiently visible rear lights 

• partially covered vehicles 

• bicycles ahead.

5.2.1. Deactivation criteria 


The deactivation criteria are dependent on which optional equipment the F48 has. The following table 
points out the deactivation criteria of the individual systems: 


System 

Distance travelled 

Speed 

Park Distance Control 

approximately 50 m 

approximately 15 km/h 

Parking Maneuver Assistant 

— 

approximately 35 km/h 

Rearview camera 

approximately 10 m 

approximately 15 km/h 


To ensure the ultrasonic sensors remain fully operational, they must be kept clean and free of ice. 
When cleaning the sensors using a high pressure cleaner, avoid direct and sustained contact with a 
high-pressure water jet. Furthermore, when using high pressure cleaners, a distance of at least 30 cm 
from the sensors must be maintained. 


5.3. Auto PDC 

PDC is automatically activated with the Auto PDC function: 

• if there is an object closer than 60 cm to the front of the vehicle when driving forwards. 

• if there is an object closer than 1.5 m to the rear of the vehicle when reversing. 

• if the speed driven does not exceed 4 km/h. 

The automatic switching-on upon the identification of obstructions can be switched on and off in the 
"Settings" menu using a controller. The settings are stored for the ID transmitter currently used.

6.2. System components 

Vehicles with the optional equipment Parking Assistant Package (SA 5DU) also obtain four additional 
ultrasonic sensors in the front bumper, as well as the rear ultrasonic sensors known from the PDC. For 
the detection of the parking space, the Parking Maneuver Assistant requires two additional ultrasonic 
sensors at the side, which can detect the parking space on the left or right of the vehicle when driving 
by. The ultrasonic sensors of the Parking Maneuver Assistant are installed in the wheel arch panels at 
the front left and right.

7. Rear View Camera 


The main function of the rear view camera system is the optical detection of a wide-angled view of the 
rear area of the vehicle in order to offer the driver additional support during the parking process 
or maneuver. The image is forwarded from the rear view camera via a CVBS line to the headunit. 

The image from the rear view camera is displayed with additional auxiliary lines in the CID. 


7.1. System components 



F48 Control unit for the rear view camera 

The lens of the rear view camera is located in the handle strip of the tailgate. 

The top rear side view camera control unit is integrated in the housing of the rear view camera. 

The new camera must be taught in after the rear view camera is replaced. The rear view camera of the 
F48 does not need to be calibrated after teaching-in, as it is self-calibrating. The calibration is effected 
during the journey by the TRSVC control unit by means of a steering angle sensor and known road 
markings. Calibration compensates for installation tolerances by shifting and rotating the image. 

The maximum time required for a full calibration is five hours. A Check Control message is displayed in 
the CID if the rear view camera could not be successfully calibrated. Reasons for failed calibration may 
be incorrect installation, dirt contamination or a defect with the rear view camera. The rear view camera 
is also constantly readjusted after a full calibration in order to ensure an optimum image.

8. Cruise Control 

8.1. Introduction 

Two cruise controls are offered for the F48. The customer can choose between the optional 
equipment DCC cruise control with braking function and the optional equipment ACC active cruise 
control. 

The DCC is an element of the optional equipment Driving Assistant Plus (SA 5AT), or can be ordered 
as separate optional equipment (SA 544). 

The ACC Stop & Go function was extended with the traffic jam assistant function. The traffic jam 
assistant is described in more detail in chapter 9 "Traffic jam assistant". 

A 

The speed control systems support the driver with adapting his speed, distance and driving style 
to the traffic conditions but do not relieve him of this responsibility. The driver may need to actively 
intervene, e.g. by braking, steering or taking evasive action, as otherwise there is a risk of an accident. 


8.2. Cruise control with braking function 

The cruise control with braking function (SA 544) is used in the F48 as optional equipment. 

The system is also referred to as "Dynamic Cruise Control". Dynamic Cruise Control supports the 
driver on roads with less traffic by keeping the speed constant irrespective of the rolling resistances 
(incline, vehicle load). In spite of the support, the driver remains responsible for control of the vehicle. 
It is possible to override the DCC function at any time by braking or accelerating the vehicle. 

When ECO PRO mode is activated, the cruise control is also adjusted to a consumption-friendly 
driving style. 

Depending on equipment, the calculation is effected in different control units: 

• The calculations are performed by the DSC control unit. 

• In vehicles that are equipped with an optional equipment system (SAS) due to other optional 
equipment packages, the calculations are performed in the SAS control unit.

8.3. Camera-based cruise control with Stop&Go function 

The active cruise control (ACC) Stop&Go function is an element of the optional equipment Driving 
Assistant Plus (SA 5AT). 

With the ACC Stop&Go function in the F48, there are no radar sensors installed for the detection 
of vehicles ahead. The detection is effected solely via the KAFAS system. 



F48 Active Cruise Control detection by KAFAS camera 


ACC Stop&Go adjusts a driver-specified desired speed and, if required by the traffic situation, also 
the preselected trailing distance automatically to the vehicle driving ahead. Passenger cars, trucks 
and motorbikes are detected as vehicles. The application range of ACC Stop&Go ranges from higher 
speeds down to a standstill. The distance and the speed are automatically adjusted in this range. 

Depending on the stationary time, driving off from a standstill is performed automatically or in 
response to a prompt by the driver. 


37 








F48 Driver Assistance Systems 

8. Cruise Control 


ACC Stop&Go detects not only slowly stopping, but also stationary vehicles, and can react to these. 
The response to transverse movements has been improved and the system can now respond more 
quickly to vehicles swerving in and out and turning off. 

The application range is extended by incorporating the KAFAS camera and the image data is evaluated 
by the KAFAS control unit. The KAFAS control unit detects vehicles clearly when their rear is identified 
by the video camera. In addition, the KAFAS control unit ensures that the driving lane information, 
vehicle positions and movements are determined. 

As the ACC Stop&Go in the F48 is a pure camera system without radar sensors, the adjustment range 
for the set speed was restricted to 140 km/h. 

The acceleration behavior of ACC Stop&Go is adapted for ECO PRO mode. In ECO PRO mode, 

ACC Stop&Go accelerates the vehicle in a fuel-efficient manner. 

A_ 

If the vehicle ahead drives off again after a standstill, the driver is informed thereof with a note. 

To drive off again, the driver must acknowledge this information. The acknowledgement is effected 
by operating the RES button or by briefly touching the accelerator pedal. Only if the duration of the 
standstill is very short (approximately 3 seconds), is the starting process effected automatically.

The front camera can detect vehicles ahead at a distance of up to 90 m. Stationary vehicles and 


vehicles weaving in and out of traffic are also detected early. 

As with the front camera it is an optical sensor, the quality of the person recognition and signal 
accuracy are dependent on the existing weather conditions. 

8.3.2. Control function 

Vehicles with ACC Stop&Go; element of optional equipment Driving Assistant Plus (SA 5AT): 

• The calculations are performed in the optional equipment system (SAS). 

Cruise control 

In principle, the cruise control in the ACC Stop&Go system works in exactly the same way as the 
Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) system. 

Distance control (ranging) 

The distance control is the core function of the ACC Stop&Go system. The driver can select a desired 
distance in four stages using a button on the multifunction steering wheel. The optional equipment 
system calculates the set point distance of the control from this preselection. 


39 























F48 Driver Assistance Systems 

8. Cruise Control 


The set point distance during the journey is proportional to the driving speed. At a lower driving speed 
the proportional distance to the driving speed is no longer used for the ACC Stop&Go, but instead a 
fixed value in metres. The distance control uses the prepared object data with the highest diagnostic 
statistic as input variables. 

Acceleration and deceleration 

Depending on the situation, the ACC Stop&Go accelerates the vehicle by a maximum of approximately 
2 m/s 2 and decelerates the vehicle by a maximum of approximately 4 m/s 2 . 

Cruise control on bends 

The cruise control of the ACC Stop&Go on bends is based on the control characteristics of the 
Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC). If an object is lost on bends, the system waits to see whether the 
object reappears (transition curve). The vehicle only accelerates if it does not reappear or the KAFAS 
camera no longer detects an object. Depending on the actual lateral acceleration, the speed is reduced 
in a longitudinal direction during controlled cornering as necessary. When coming out of the bend the 
speed is adjusted until it once again reaches the desired level. 


8.3.3. Display 

The set speed is shown in the instrument cluster with digital speed reading. During active control this 
display is illuminated in green. If the active cruise control is in a "Deactivated" state this display 
is illuminated in orange. The resume speed is displayed. 

Vehicles driving ahead to which a safe trailing distance is observed are displayed in orange in the round 
instrument as soon as they have been detected and are at a distance relevant for the control. If the 
system can no longer adjust a safe distance, for example due to very high differential speeds, then 
the driver is requested to assume the guidance of the vehicle entirely by a flashing red vehicle symbol 
and an acoustic signal. With active control the messages are also displayed in the optional equipment 
Head-Up Display HUD (SA 610). 

8.3.4. Operation 

ACC Stop&Go cannot only be activated by the driver during the journey, but also when the vehicle is at 
a standstill, if the system detected another vehicle before its own vehicle. To activate ACC Stop&Go at 
standstill, the driver must press the brake pedal and at the same time press the SET or RES button. 

When the system is active the set speed can be adjusted in 1 or 10 km/h increments. 

The driver has the option at any time to override the ACC system request and thus accelerate stronger 
by pressing the accelerator pedal. The system is not activated as a result. The overriding 
is shown in the instrument cluster by the suppression of the distance bar.

The following conditions must also be satisfied for activation: 

• Seat belt fastened and door closed 

• Drive position D is engaged 

• Engine running 

• Parking brake not activated 

• No system faults detected 

The system does not decelerate for: 

• pedestrians, cyclists or similar slow road users 

• red lights 

• cross traffic 

• oncoming traffic 

• unlit vehicles or vehicles with defective lighting at night 

Detection 

Many vehicles are not detected or are detected at a late stage. The reason for this may be: 

• Vehicles swinging out 

A vehicle ahead is only detected when it is completely in its own lane. 

• Cornering 

In narrow bends there may be situations where a vehicle ahead is no longer detected or 
detected at a significantly later stage due to the restricted detection range of the system. 

Malfunction 

If the system has a malfunction, the driver is made aware of such with a Check Control message. 
The reasons for malfunctions may be: 

• heavy fog, rain, rain spray or snow 

• if the camera field of view or the windscreen is dirty or concealed 

• strong back light 

• up to 20 seconds after engine starting via the START-STOP button 

• when calibrating the camera immediately after vehicle delivery
