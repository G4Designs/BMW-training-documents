F48 Powertrain 
1. Drive Variants 


The F48 is available with xDrive. The following graphic shows the layout of that version. 



F48 Drive 

In the F48 a completely new drive unit is used, which fits perfectly with the spatial functional concept 
of the BMW XI thanks to its model-specific design. 

The new BMW XI xDrive28i is one of the first vehicles of BMW which will be driven by the brand new 
4-cylinder engine. It is a part of the newly developed modular engine family. It is a lightweight, powerful 
and economical engine, which is equipped with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology.

1. Drive Variants 


The following list shows the advantages of the different drive concepts (for vehicles with a front 
engine): 


Front-wheel drive 


Rear-wheel drive 


The drive unit is comparatively compact 
and is integrated between the axle 
mounting, steering and footwell. 

Large and variable spatial offering 
thanks to reduction or deletion of 
the transmission tunnel and rear axle 
differential. 

Weight and cost reductions, due to 
deletion of propeller shaft and rear axle 
differential, as well as integration of the 
differential in the transmission. 

Good traction on smooth roadway, 
independent of the load status of the 
vehicle, due to higher axle load at the 
driven axle. 

Reasonable behavior in the event 
of a head-on collision (engine and 
transmission intrude the passenger 
compartment less). 


Small turning circle possible, as no 
rear view of the drive required with the 
steered front axle. 

No annoying drive influences in the 
steering. 

Good power transmission to the 
roadway during acceleration, as the 
driven axle is loaded (primarily when 
driving off on inclines). 

Balanced axle-load distribution 
possible. 

Excellent dynamic cornering behavior.

A frameless cooling module is installed in the F48. This is made possible by a concept with different 
separation points between radiator and charge air cooler, using, joint interfaces for body and coolant 
hoses. 

In vehicles with an automatic transmission, a transmission oil-coolant-heat exchanger is also flange- 
mounted at the transmission. This is supplied with coolant via the crankcase and adapted coolant 
hoses. 

In the following diagram you see the connection of the cooling module at the cooling circuit using the 
example of the B46 engine.

3. Automatic Transmission 


The excellent efficiency was able to be achieved by the following measures: 

• Small oil pump 

• Lower transmission oil main pressure 

• Optimal lubricating oil quantity 

• Transmission oil with low viscosity 

• Large steering axis inclination 

• Very accurate control of the multidisc converter lockup clutch at low loads 
by three-line activation 

• Designed for automatic engine start-stop function (there is also an electric oil 
pump in the hydraulic block in order to maintain the minimum oil pressure) 

• Designed for idle speed coasting 

Good ride and shifting comfort was able to be realized with the following measures: 

• Newly developed mechanical torsional vibration damper 

• Efficient hydraulics with new valves 

• Efficient clutch and brake control 

• Excellent direct shifting capability (multiple downshifts, explained in the following) 

In the Sport program and Manual mode the shift point and shift speed have a more sporty dimension. 



F48 EGS, 8-speed automatic transmission 


The electronic transmission control is located in the F48 on the transmission housing. The selector 
lever position switch is designed as a hall effect sensor and integrated in the EGS. The outer wiring 
between EGS, selector lever position switch and transmission was discontinued, whereby the 
susceptibility to faults was also reduced.

3.1. Designation 

The transmission designation in the technical documentation allows it to be uniquely identified. 

In frequent cases, however, only a short designation is used. This short form is used so the 
transmission can be assigned to a transmission family. The GA8HP transmission family, consisting 
of several transmissions such as the GA8HP45Z, the GA8HP70Z and the GA8HP90Z, is often 
mentioned.

3.4. Direct shifting 

With the new automatic transmission of the F48, in most cases direct shifting to the desired gear is 
possible. This also applies if gears are skipped. 

A direct gear change is always possible if the status has to change for one of the switched clutches 
or brakes. Otherwise, a two-stage gear change is performed. However, in general the customer does 
not notice this due to the optimized transmission control unit. 

The following table shows the switched brakes and clutches for each gear using the example of the 
GA6F21AW.

Examples: 

• Direct shift is possible from 4th to 2nd gear, as the clutch Cl does not have to be shifted. 

• Direct shift is not possible from 5th to 2nd gear as both the brake B1 and the clutch Cl 
have to be switched. 


3.5. Coasting in idle 

For the F48 the "Coasting in idle position" function is available. Under certain prerequisites the engine 
is automatically disconnected from the transmission in gear selector switch position D. The engine 
runs here at idle speed. 

Further information on "Coasting" is available in the product information bulletin "F01/F02 LCI 
Displays and Operation". 


3.6. Launch Control 

For vehicles with Sports automatic transmission (SA 2TB), launch control enables optimal acceleration 
when driving off. Forced upshifts are also performed without a reduction of the engine torque. This 
enables additional acceleration during the gearshifts. 


In order to avoid premature component wear, the drive-off with launch control is only available 100 
times over the service life of the Sports automatic transmission and cannot be reset by Service.

4 

Press the accelerator pedal beyond the resistance at the kick-down pressure point 
and hold. 

- Flag symbol appears in the instrument cluster and the engine speed for pulling 
away is adjusted. 

5 

Release the brake within 3 seconds and hold the accelerator pedal. 

-Vehicle accelerates optimally. 


3.7. ConnectedShift 

ConnectedShift uses navigation data for a forward-thinking shift strategy of the automatic 
transmission. If, for example, a sharp bend is detected, the automatic transmission shifts down early 
and the gear is retained in the bend. 

The route guidance of the navigation system does not need to be activated for the function. However, 
the identification of a turn-off request, for example by the active route guidance or operating the turn 
indicator, helps to control the system more accurately. Up-to-date navigation map data also influences 
the control accuracy. 

3.7.1. Characteristics and availability 

In SPORT and COMFORT modes, the characteristics of ConnectedShift are adapted to the respective 
driving program, in ECO PRO mode ConnectedShift is not available. ConnectedShift is also not 
available during control operation of cruise control. 

ConnectedShift is used in the F48, depending on the equipment, specifically in vehicles with gas 
engine, automatic transmission and navigation system. 

A prerequisite is that the map data and the required additional information for the country are available. 
This is dependent on the navigation map provider and is not available worldwide for all countries.

4.1. Introduction 

The all-wheel drive system in the F48 was redeveloped and for the first time at BMW. Although this 
all-wheel drive system is also called xDrive, it is considerably different from the versions previously 
installed, which were based on a rear-wheel drive. 

The differences of the xDrive versions are listed in the following section. 


4.1.1. Comparison of all-wheel drive systems 

The following graphic shows the all-wheel drive system of the F48 compared to the F25.

• Low space requirement 

• Low weight 

• Low splashing losses in the multidisc clutch (thanks to "Efficient mode") 

• C0 2 reduction

Rear axle differential (with integrated longitudinal torque distribution) 


With xDrive some of this driving power is transmitted to the rear output shafts (7) via the angular 
gearbox (3), the propeller shaft (5) and the rear axle differential (9). The gear ratio in the angular 
gearbox is 1.74 :1 and in the rear axle differential 1 :1.74. 

The engine speed is increased and, at the same time, the torque is reduced, as a result of the ratio 
in the angular gearbox. The propeller shaft can therefore be designed with smaller dimensions. The 
weight reduction helps the fuel consumption and the fewer moving masses benefit the smooth 
running. 

In the rear axle differential the ratio is then reversed, so that the same engine speed is applied to the 
front and rear output shafts.

The angular gearbox is located behind the engine and is secured at the automatic transmission and at 
the crankcase. It transmits some of the driving power to the propeller shaft and is designed as a single- 
stage, i.e. only has one fixed ratio. 

The input shaft of the angular gearbox is designed as a hollow shaft and is connected directly to the 
differential housing of the front axle differential. The driving power is transmitted from the differential 
housing to the propeller shaft via the hollow shaft, the crown wheel and the pinion shaft. 

As a power interruption in the angular gearbox is not possible, the propeller shaft is driven 
continuously via the pinion shaft during the journey. 

Irrespective of this, the intermediate shaft is guided to the front right output shaft through the hollow 
shaft and the crown wheel in the angular gearbox.

4. xDrive 


The propeller shaft is responsible for transmitting driving power provided by the angular gearbox in the 
form of torque and engine speed to the rear axle differential. With help of the tripod joint, it offsets the 
deflection angle and linear variations resulting from the assembly movements. 

In front of the propeller shaft center bearing is a hexagon head (3), at which the propeller shaft can be 
rotated. As a result, for left-hand drive vehicles there is the option to remove the propeller shaft from 
the angular gearbox, if the inlay nut (1) is held over the right wheel arch at the same time. 

In the F48 with four-wheel drive, the currently longest propeller shaft of all current BMW models is 
installed. It is 2.2 m long. It is designed as a two-piece tubular shaft and is secured to the body in the 
area of the middle joint via the flexible center mount. 

A 

The propeller shaft can be bent a maximum of 10°. Otherwise, the gaiter in the tripod joint will incur 
damage! 

Support the propeller shaft during removal and installation and secure the gaiter with anti-kink 
protection. It is imperative the current repair instructions are observed when working at the propeller 
shaft.

In the front propeller shaft sections, two contoured pipe sections are inserted in one another. 

The contour of the two pipe sections means it is possible to transfer the drive torque. In addition, the 
two pipe sections can be adjusted towards each other, whereby a coating generates a defined friction 
force of 20 kN. 

In the event of a front-end collision, a counterforce of maximum 20 kN is generated, so that an 
additional load path is not created. 

A_ 

Following an accident, the shift unit of the propeller shaft must be checked. If the two pipe sections 
have shifted into one another, the propeller shaft must be replaced. The criteria for checking and 
replacing specified in the repair instructions are to be complied with precisely.

Both the longitudinal torque distribution control unit and the EHPS pump unit are secured at the side 
at the transmission. 

The longitudinal torque distribution clutch is integrated in the rear axle differential. The input shaft is 
driven by the propeller shaft via the input flange. The output flange drives the differential, depending 
on requirements.

Depending on the driving situation, the longitudinal torque distribution can direct some of the driving 
power (up to maximum torque of 1300 Nm) to the rear axle, sometimes before the wheels even spin. 

The DSC sends information about the clutch torque to be adjusted to the BDC via FlexRay and to 
the longitudinal torque distribution control unit via the K-CAN3. The longitudinal torque distribution 
control unit controls the speed of the EHPS using pulse-width modulations. Depending on the speed, 
the EHPS applies an operating pressure of 0 to 40 bar to the clutch longitudinal torque distribution. 

The pressure is not measured by a pressure sensor, but checked via a voltage/current comparison. 

In driving situations in which the four-wheel drive is not required, the system switches to "Efficient 
mode". The "Efficient valve" lowers the oil level in the clutch, thus reducing the splashing losses. If the 
four-wheel drive is required again, the maximum torque can be provided within 250 ms. The spring- 
loaded "Efficient valve" is operated by the oil pressure. 

Adaptations, which monitor the system behavior and ensure position precision, are constantly 
performed in the longitudinal torque distribution control unit. A calibration is performed once during 
the driving cycle (terminal 15 ON) and stored. 

Together with the calibration, a system ventilation is also carried out. The pressure is increased briefly 
to approximately 45 bar in order to open the vent valve. The ventilation procedure guarantees quick 
pressure build-up in every regulating situation.

4.3.2. Operating strategy 

The operating strategy ensures that the four-wheel drive is operated as required and in an energy 
efficient manner. The traction requirement is detected in a proactive manner and the drive torque 
redirected accordingly. 

In most driving situations only the front wheels are driven. Only in certain situations is some of the 
drive torque also transmitted to the rear wheels. The distribution of the drive torque between the 
front and rear wheels is defined by the DSC. The following criteria are taken into account: 

• Speed 

• Lateral and longitudinal acceleration 

• Brake control 

• Steering angle 

• Wheel speeds 

• Vehicle longitudinal inclination 

• Pedal sensor position 

• Active driving program (SPORT, COMFORT, ECO PRO) 

• DSC status (DSC activated/deactivated, DTC activated/deactivated) 

Depending on the driving situation, some of the drive torque is transmitted to the rear wheels. 

The exact ratio of the torque distribution is dependent on the activation of the multidisc clutch, 
as well as the slip of the wheels. Some factors on the activation of the multidisc clutch are listed below. 

The four-wheel drive is activated in the following situations, if there are no other criteria present which 
prevent this: 

• Understeering vehicle 

• Increased difference in speed between front and rear wheels 

• Large vehicle longitudinal inclination (e.g. on inclines) 

• Kick-down position 

• Sporty driving style 

• Respective environmental conditions, roadway conditions and type of terrain 

The four-wheel drive is switched off in the following situations, if there are no other criteria present 
which prevent this: 

• Large steering angle and driving speeds 

• Strong braking (ABS) 

To assess the road condition and thus for effective, proactive longitudinal torque distribution, the 
coefficients of friction between the tires and roadway are calculated by the DSC. The wheel slip, 
as well as the longitudinal and lateral acceleration, are evaluated.

If wheel speed information received by the DSC suggests different tire rolling circumferences of the 
wheels (e.g. for tires with varying degrees of wear), the multidisc clutch is no longer closed 100 %. 
Differences in speed, resulting from different wheel speeds at the front and rear axle, are reduced in 
this case via the multidisc clutch, so that high torques are not transmitted to the drive train. 

As the multidisc clutch is not closed 100 % in this situation, the maximum transmittable drive torque 
to the rear axle is reduced. 


4.4. Notes for Service 

• The propeller shaft must be removed when working on the brake test stand. 

• When working on the brake test stand, all-wheel drive vehicle-specific points do not have to be 
observed (the test stand mode for checking the brake system is automatically detected). 

• The vehicle cannot be towed away if only one axle is raised. 

• Both the angular gearbox and the rear axle differential have an oil filling that lasts the entire 
service life of the assembly. 

• Using the diagnosis system, both the mechanics and the tightness of the EHPS can be 
checked (here the pressure is checked via a voltage/current comparison). 

• In order to remove the angular gearbox, the starter motor also has to be removed. 

• Similar to the previous all-wheel drive system, tires with very different tread depths cannot be 
used at the front and rear axle. 

• The maximum permissible deflection angle of the propeller shaft cannot be exceeded.

Output shaft, front right 


The left output shaft is designed as a single piece. The right output shaft consists of an intermediate 
shaft at the engine and the actual right output shaft. Both output shafts are roughly the same length 
and have similar torsional rigidity. 

The front output shafts are designed according to the maximum transmittable torque, in order to 
achieve minimal component weight. 

The transmission-end tripod joints offset differences in length and deflection angles, the wheel- 
side fixed ball joints only offsets the deflection angles. The interfaces for the transmission or the 
intermediate shaft are defined as a journal solution and are designed depending on the respective 
transmission. The interface for the wheels is designed as a spur gearing solution and is identical 
for all sizes.

Due to the transversal installation of the engine and transmission, in the F48 the front output shafts no 
longer have to be guided by the oil sump, as for example in the BMW X3 xDrive. In vehicles with a four- 
wheel drive, however, the front right output shaft is guided by the angular gearbox.
