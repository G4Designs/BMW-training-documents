The New 7 Series for 2009 


Introduction of the F01/F02 

In the late fall of 2008, the F01 will be in production in the Dingolfing plant. At the same time, the F02 (long-wheelbase version) will start 
coming off the assembly line. 

For the US market, the 750i and 750Li will be offered with the already known N63 engine. The F01/F02 is lower in height than the 
E65/E66 and it has an improved rear passenger compartment area (space for head/knees). The overall wheelbase has been increased 
as well. The headroom and luggage-compartment capacity are more or less the same as in the E65. 



The F01 represents the 5th generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship sedan. In addition to being the pinnacle of luxury, the new 7 series 
also combines the new engine and chassis systems to deliver class leading performance. With the already proven N63 engine, the F01 
is more than capable of delivering on the promise of “Efficient Dynamics” which encompasses performance as well as the best possible 
fuel efficiency. 

As in the past, the 7 Series is packed with the latest innovations in driver information and assistance systems. Some of these optional 
innovations include ACC Stop and Go, Night Vision 2, Lane Departure Warning, Active Blind Spot Detection as well as rearview and 
side view camera systems. 

To complement the many new developments on the 7 Series, there is also a new rear wheel steering system which is part of the new 
“Integral Active Steering System”. This is the first time such a system has been installed on a BMW sedan. This system as well as 
many other innovations and developments will be covered during the progression of this training course. 

For more detailed information, please refer to the reference material (course code - ST811) which can be found on ICP or TIS.

Powertrain 


Changes to Powertrain 

For the US market, the F01/02 will be introduced with the familiar 
N63 engine. For the most part, the engine is identical to the 
version introduced on the E71. 

Mechanically, there are no changes to the engine. The primary 
differences exist in the form of ancillary components which are 
vehicle specific such as the exhaust, air intake ducting, cooling 
system, oil sump and engine electrical system. 

The overview of the F01 powertrain includes the following: 

• The engine management (DME) is now connected to the 
FlexRay bus in addition to the PT-CAN. 

• The ECM (DME) is now water cooled via the cooling circuit 
for the charge aircoolers. 

• The fuel tank has been modified with additional breather 
valves as well as additional measures to reduce evaporative 
emissions. 

• The low pressure fuel supply method is now a “pressure 
controlled” design which eliminates the pressure regulator in 
the fuel tank. 

• The GA6FIP26TU automatic transmission is carried over 
from the E70/71 with the dual damper torgue converter. 

• The rear differential is now made from aluminum for weight 
reduction. It has been optimized for low-friction operation. 

• The driveshaft now uses the “push-fit” connection from the 
E70. For the first time, this is now a flexible connection. 

• The rear axle shaft now have a “push-fit” connection at both 
ends. The F01 uses a solid axle shaft.

Engine Control Unit 

In the F01/F02, the N63 engine is controlled by the MSD85 as is 
the case in the E71. This control unit has been modified to make it 
compatible with the FlexRay used in the F01/F02.

The ECM (DME) is located to the front of the right-side spring strut 
dome. The ECM is now water cooled via a circuit which is adapted 
from the charge air cooling circuit. 

The lower section of the electronics box is open to the outside. 

The upper section, which contains the connections, has a 
water-tight seal. 

System Bleeding 

When servicing the ECM or any cooling system components 
within the charge air cooling circuit, the system must be bled 
of any trapped air. 

In order to do this, the system is bled much the same way as 
vehicles with the N54 engine. See the “Workshop Exercise - 
Cooling System” in this workbook.

Cooling System 


In principle, the complex cooling system of the N63 engine is a 
carry-over from the E71. 

Nevertheless, there are a few differences: 

• no separate auxiliary coolant radiator 

• engine oil radiator to the front of the left side wheel housing 

• an additional engine oil radiator to the front of the right side 
wheel housing 

• water-cooled engine control unit. 

The cooling system comprizes two separate cooling circuits as it 
did before. One cools the engine, one cools the charge air.

The only obvious difference is that no auxiliary coolant radiator is 
used in the F01/F02. This is made possible by the use of high- 
performance coolant radiators. These also have a more compact 
height, which is essential when it comes to pedestrian safety. 

As usual, the coolant radiator has an integrated low-temperature 
section for transmission cooling. 

Thanks to the on-demand control of the electric fan, the character¬ 
istic map thermostat and the electric auxiliary coolant pump, the 
thermal management system yields benefits in terms of fuel econ¬ 
omy, comfort and power output. 

The entire cooling module and the engine oil radiator and its lines 
are decoupled from the body in order to optimize sound character¬ 
istics in the passenger compartment. 






































































Charge Air Cooling 

As it did in the E71, the turbocharged N63 engine operates with 
an indirect form of charge air cooling. Heat from the charge air is 
transferred to the coolant, then the hot coolant radiates heat into 
the ambient air. 


There is a dedicated coolant circuit for this function. In the 
F01/F02, the cooling for the DME is also integrated into this 
coolant circuit. For the first time at BMW, the engine control 
unit is liquid-cooled.

Fuel System F01/F02 


The fuel system on the F01/02 has gone under some design 
changes as compared to previous models. The familiar fuel tank 
with divided chambers is still in use. The familiar configuration 
which features the fuel pump on the right (passenger) side is also 
retained. 

Fuel Supply System 

In order to comply with the regulations regarding evaporative 
emissions, there have been several changes to internal fuel tank 
components as well as the fuel tank itself. 

The fuel supply system has also been modified to eliminate the 
fuel pressure regulator. The following text summarizes the 
changes to the fuel supply system: 

• the fuel supply system is now “pressure controlled”. 

• the fuel pressure regulator has been replaced by the 
“pressure limiting valve” (8). 

• the pressure in the fuel supply system is limited to a maximum 
of 5.8 bar by the pressure limiting valve (8). 

• the EKPS will control the fuel pump in order to deliver only 
the amount of fuel required based on information from the 
fuel pressure sensor (low pressure).

Pressure Limiting Valve 

The pressure limiting valve is connected to ground by the plug-in 
contacts on the service cover. This prevents electrostatic charge 
on the valve. 

The pressure limiting valve keeps fuel pressures in the feed section 
lower than approximately 5.8 bar in the N63 engines 

This prevents excess pressures from building up in the feed line. 
Excess pressures would otherwise occur if the fuel filter were to 
become blocked, which would place the feed section of the fuel 
system under unnecessarily heavy loads.

F01 Workbook - Module 1 


Fuel Tank Breather System 

The increased demands on the evaporative emission systems 
require continuous development and improvements. The F01/F02 
is no different. One of the first things to notice on the fuel tank is 
that there is only one service port. Also, the tank is made from two 
pieces and joined by a plastic “welding” process. 

The only items which are serviceable at this time are the fuel 
pump, fuel filter and pressure limiting valve. There are several 
breather valves installed to help the fuel tank “breathe” during 
refueling and during operation. 

These valves are therefore divided into filler valves and service 
breather valves. The service breather valves have a smaller 
opening, which means that, during refueling, they alone would not 
be able to let air escape from the fuel tank fast enough. 

There are service breather valves with and without over fueling 
protection. The service breather valves are arranged in such a way 
that air can still be released even if the vehicle is parked up on one 
side. 

The filler breather valve is located at a high position. If the fuel level 
rises to this height during refueling, the valve closes. Air can no 
longer escape from the fuel tank fast enough, which causes fuel to 
rise up the filler pipe and switch off the fuel nozzle. 

To enable the release of air to continue, there is a service breather 
valve located at the highest point. However, the presence of the 
valve in this location means that the fuel tank could be overfilled in 
the event of persistent refueling. 

Consequently, fuel would enter the activated charcoal filter and 
ultimately flow back out of the opening. To prevent this, the highest 
service breather valve is equipped with over fueling protection like 
the one on the left-hand side of the vehicle (as a safeguard if the 
vehicle were parked up on one side). Fuel that is carried along with 
the release of air is collected in a fuel trap and pumped back into 
the surge chamber.

F01 


Automatic Transmission 

The F01/F02 is available exclusively with an automatic transmis¬ 
sion. The transmission is the GA6FIP26TU that was introduced 
with the E70 and was subsequently fitted in many model series 
since. 

The F01/F02 features the already familiar electronic gearshift 
carried over from the E7X and E6X vehicles. The GWS is mounted 
on the center console which differs from the previous column 
mounted shifter on the E65. 

Gear Selector Switch 

The gear selector switch on the F01/F02 has been carried over 
from the E6x and E7x. In both automatic and manual mode, opera¬ 
tion of the switch is monostable. In other words, the selector lever 
always returns to its original position. 



The gear selector switch also contains the control unit (GWS), 
which is connected to the electric gearshift controller by the 
PT-CAN like it was before. The second, redundant connection, is 
no longer connected by the LIN bus as used to be the case, but by 
the new PT-CAN2. 


- Module 1 


30 


Emergency Release 

As you would expect, the F01/F02 has an emergency release for 
the automatic transmission. This functions in much the same way 
as that of the E70. 

The emergency release is located under the ashtray to the front of 
the gear selector switch. 

Rear Axle Differential 

The key aim in the development of the final drive in the F01/F02 
was to make considerable savings on weight at the same time as 
increasing the maximum transmission capacity. The new aluminum 
differential offers a weight reduction of approximately 15 % com¬ 
pared with previous differentials. 

In addition, efficiency was further improved by efforts to achieve 
optimum spline geometries. The result is a new generation of final 
drives, which are also notable for their aluminum casing. 

Through the use of efficient bearings, optimum spline geometries 
in the oil circuit and an optimum oil volume in the differential, it was 
possible to reduce friction losses and churning losses and to there¬ 
by increase efficiency even further. Together with better heat 
dissipation, this has contributed to lower oil temperatures. 

The differential for the F01/02 (750i/iL) is as follows: 

• Differential type = 225AL 

• Ratio = 3.462 

• Weight (in kg) = 29.7 

These differentials are recognizable by the letters "AL" in their 
designation (A = aluminum casing, L = low-friction). 


Driveshaft and Axles 

The driveshaft on the F01 is made from steel and designed to 
meet the torque requirements of the N63 engine. 

In addition to torque transfer, key aims in the designing of the drive- 
shaft for the F01/F02 were to satisfy demands for comfort in terms 
of noise and vibration.

Push-fit connection 


The joints, shaft junctions and shaft diameters were designed in 
such a way that no disturbance noise or vibrations at the connect¬ 
ing points are transmitted through the body. 

On the F01/F02, the driveshaft is connected to the automatic 
transmission and rear axle differential exclusively by flexible 
couplings. This minimizes high-frequency gear tooth noise 
at the rear axle differential. 


The connection to the automatic transmission is a screw-fitted 
one. At the rear axle differential end, it is push-fitted as it is on the 
E70. Flowever, this is the first time that a push-fit connection with 
flexible coupling has been used. The center connection is a slide 
piece connection with universal joint. 

The driveshaft absorbs some of the impact energy in the event of a 
head-on collision. Improvements have been made to the 
properties of this crash function, which is integrated into the 
forward driveshaft shaft tube. The compression force under which 
the forward driveshaft shaft tube is meant to deform has been 
further reduced with no effect on torque transfer capability. 

Despite increased demands in terms of torque and comfort, it was 
possible to reduce weight by comparison with the predecessor 
model. 

Axle Shafts 

The F01/F02 has axle shafts that are push-fit at each end, i.e. 
wheel end and differential end. The axles shafts on the N63 engine 
have solid shafts. 

Due to the position of the rear axle differential, the drive shafts on 
the left and right have a different overall length.

Overview of the Bus Systems in the F01/F02 

This information contained within this workbook deals with the bus 
systems of the F01/F02. In addition to the following overview of 
bus systems, you will find a further overview of the bus systems on 
the fold-out pages contained within this workbook. 

The fold-out page provides you with an immediate reference to the 
bus overview while working with the workbook. 





K-CAN 2 
Bus Systems 

The following innovations have been implemented in the bus 
systems in the new BMW F01/F02: 

• PT-CAN with additional PT-CAN 2 (500 kBit/s) 

• K-CAN with additional K-CAN 2 (500 kBits/s) 

• FlexRay has been expanded and has replaced the F-CAN from 
previous models. 

• Ethernet (fast programming access) 

• LIN bus system with extended functions. 


- Module 1 


38 


Structure in Vehicle 

With deployment of the central gateway module, the F01/F02 has a 
newly linked bus structure. The engine management and 
chassis control systems are linked across the PT-CAN (or PT-CAN 
2) and the FlexRay bus system to the central gateway module 
(ZGM). 

The control units of the general vehicle electrics are connected 
across the K-CAN and K-CAN 2. 

The MOST is the information carrier for the majority of control units 
in the area of information and communication technologies. 

The vehicle diagnosis communicates across the D-CAN. 

The vehicle is programmed/encoded via the Ethernet access point. 
The sub-bus system LIN has other links. CAN - Ethernet - FlexRay 
- LIN - An exact description of these bus systems can be found in 
this workbook and the ST811 Reference Information. 

Overall Network of the F01/F02 

The overall network in the F01/F02 consists of various bus sys¬ 
tems that enable communication between the individual control 
units. In view of the increasing interconnection of the control units, 
it is possible to use the sensors of one system throughout the net¬ 
work. 

The sensors are connected to the control unit that initially reguires 
the information logic-based and virtually in real time. This informa¬ 
tion, however, can also be made available to other control units. 

Using the example of the vertical dynamics management (VDM), 
initially, the VDM control unit picks up the ride-height levels of the 
wheels using height-level sensors. The automatic headlight verti¬ 
cal aim control can also use this information for the purpose of 
adapting the beam throw of the headlights. 





The VDM makes available the information via the corresponding 
bus systems (VDM - FlexRay - ZGM - K-CAN 2 - FRM) to the 
footwell module. 

Apart from the Ethernet, all bus systems in the F01/F02 are already 
known from other BMW models. This section provides an 
overview of all bus systems of the F01/F02. 

This workbook contains a detailed description of the Ethernet 
system, of the FlexRay bus and of the LIN bus sub-bus system. 

Overview of Bus Systems 

In principle, a distinction is made between two groups of bus 
systems: 

• Main bus systems: Ethernet, FlexRay, KCAN, K-CAN 2, 

MOST, PT-CAN and PTCAN 2 

• Sub-bus systems: BSD, D-CAN (diagnosis on CAN), LIN, 

Local-CAN. 

Main-bus systems are responsible for the data exchange between 
the ECUs throughout the vehicle system. This includes system 
functions such as diagnosis, programming and encoding. 

Sub-bus systems exchange data within one function group. 

For example, the data of the rain-light-solar-condensation sensor 
are read in by the junction box electronics, processed and forward¬ 
ed to the wiper module. 

The connection between the control units of the rain-light-solar- 
condensation sensor and junction box electronics is a sub-bus and 
designed as a LIN bus.

Changes to Main Bus Systems 

The most important changes to the changes systems in the 
F01/F02 are: 

• Ethernet - fast vehicle programming access 

• Powering up certain bus systems also possible 
without wake-up line (now KCAN 2). 

The central gateway module interlinks all the main bus systems.

Diagnosis Can (D-CAN) 

The F01/F02 will continue will the D-CAN for diagnostic communi¬ 
cation. In order for the F01 to communicate with the latest BMW 
diagnostic eguipment, the ICOM A must be used. 



In addition, the D-CAN on the F01 uses a pair of terminal resistors 
on the D-CAN circuit. One is located in the ZGM, the other is 
located in the wiring harness between the diagnostic connector 
(OBD II) and ZGM.

The diagnosis socket is located under the dashboard on the

diagnosis system. 

On board access (OBD) in the vehicle will remain unchanged. 
The pin assignments are as follows: 

• 16 = Terminal 30 

• 5 = Terminal 31 

• 14 + 6 = Communication connections 

• 3,11,12,13 = Ethernet connections. 

• 8 = activation of Ethernet.

K-CAN 

The bus systems used to date are also used in the F01/F02. 

The K-CAN is responsible for communication of the components 
with a low data transfer rate. The K-CAN is also connected to the 
other bus systems via the central gateway module. 

The K-CAN is set up as line topology. Some control units in the 
K-CAN have a LIN bus as sub-bus. The K-CAN has a data transfer 
rate of 100 kBit/s and is designed as a twisted pair of wires. 

The K-CAN has the possibility to be operated as a single-wire bus 
in the event of a fault. 

The K-CAN control unit is wakened via the bus, without an addi¬ 
tional wake-up line. 



K-CAN 2 

The K-CAN 2 is responsible for communication of the control units 
with a high data transfer rate. The K-CAN 2 is also connected to 
the other bus systems via the central gateway module (ZGM). 

A LIN-Bus as a sub-bus is connected to all control units in the 
K-CAN 2. The K-CAN 2 can be wakened via any of these sub 
busses, without an additional (hardwire) wake-up line. This is rep¬ 
resented by the “wake authorized” symbol \~\ next to all of the 
control units of K-CAN 2 on the Bus Overview. (See bus chart below). 

To provide a rapid start enable, the CAS has an additional 
redundant bus connection to the DME. On this CAS bus, the data 
are transferred per K bus protocol. 

The K-CAN 2 has a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s and is designed 
as a twisted pair of wires. 

There are 2 terminal resistors on K-CAN 2 are located in the ZGM 
and JB electronics.

gearbox control, but now also interconnects systems in the area of 
safety and driver assistance systems.

the engine management system and also transfers signals to the 
fuel pump control.

terminal 30 have an additional wake-up line (see illustration). 

The terminal resistors in the PT-CAN are located in the following 
control units: 

• Instrument cluster (Kombi) 

• Electromechanical parking brake (EMF) 


The PT-CAN 2 has a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s and is

The terminal resistors in the PT-CAN 2 are located in the following 
control units: 

• Digital Motor Electronics (DME) 

• Control unit for electric fuel pump (EKPS). 
































































Ethernet 


Ethernet is a manufacturer-neutral, cable bound network technolo¬ 
gy. Most computer networks nowadays are based on this data 
transfer technology. 

The so-called Ethernet was developed more than 30 years ago. 
Since then, the data transfer rates have multiplied. The Ethernet is 
the F01 has a data transfer rate of 100 MBit/s. 

Application in the F01/F02 

The Ethernet in the diagnosis socket is only enabled when the 
BMW programming system (ICOM A) is connected. There is an 
activation bridge in the programming connector, between pins 8 
and 16. This switches the power supply for the Ethernet controller 
in the central gateway module. 

This means that Ethernet access to the central gateway module is 
disabled while the vehicle is being driven by the customer. 

Security 

Each participant in an Ethernet has an individually assigned ID 
number, a MAC address (Media Access Control). This address and 
the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) identifies the vehicle to the 
BMW programming system on connection setup. This prevents 
changes to the data records and stored values by third parties. 

In the same way as in a computer network in the office, each 
device in a network must receive unigue identification. This is why 
the central gateway module is assigned a so-called IP address by 
the programming system after connection setup. 

The function of an IP address in a network corresponds to that of a 
telephone number in the telephone network. This IP address is 
assigned per DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). 

This is a method of automatic allocation for IP addresses to user 
devices in a network. 



Features of Ethernet 

• Very high data rate of 100 MBit/s 

• System start time with connection setup and address assign¬ 
ment under three seconds, sleeping under one second 

• System access only via BMW programming systems. 
Functions of Ethernet 

• Faster programming of the vehicle in Service 

• Transmission of media data between ZGM and CIC 

The wiring between the diagnosis socket and ZGM is with two 
pairs of wires without additional shielding. There is also an activat¬ 
ing line that supplies the Ethernet controllers in the control units 
with voltage.

FlexRay - Application in the F01/F02 

In the F01/F02, the FlexRay bus system is being used for the first 
time across systems to network dynamic driving control systems 
and the engine management system in a series vehicle. 

The central gateway module sets up the link between the various 
bus systems and the FlexRay. 



FlexRay Bus Topology on the F01 

The FlexRay is shown in a simplified form in the overview of the 
bus systems. The actual topology is shown in the illustration.

The ZGM contains two so-called star couplers, each with four bus 
drivers. The bus drivers forward the data of the control units via the 
communication controller to the central gateway module (ZGM). 
Depending on the type of termination the FlexRay control units 
have, they are connected to these bus drivers in two different ways. 

Bus Termination 

In the same way as most bus systems, resistors for termination 
(as bus termination) are also used at both ends of the data lines 
on the FlexRay to prevent reflections on the lines. 




The value of these terminal resistors is determined from the data 
transfer rate and cable lengths. The terminal resistors are located 
in the control units. 

If only one control unit is connected to a bus driver (e.g. SZL to 
the bus driver BDO), the connections on the bus driver and on 
the control unit are fitted with a terminal resistor. This type of 
connection at the central gateway module is called "end node 
termination". 


ZGM 

BD2 


□ DSC 



If the connection at the control unit is not the physical finish node 
(e.g. DSC, ICM and DME at the bus driver BD2), it is referred to as 
a FlexRay transmission and forwarding line. In this case, both of 
the components must be terminated at the ends of each bus path 
with terminal resistors. 

This connection option exists for the central gateway module and a 
number of control units. Flowever, the control unit with a transmis¬ 
sion and forwarding line has a 'non end node termination' for data 
pickup. This type of termination cannot be tested using measure¬ 
ment systems at the control unit connector due to its resistor/ 
capacitor circuit. To measure the (current-free) FlexRay bus to 
determine the line or terminating resistance, please be sure to 
use the vehicle wiring diagram.

F01 Workbook - Module 1 


Wiring 

The wiring of the FlexRay bus in the F01/F02 is executed as a 
sheathed, two-wire, twisted cable. The sheathing protects the 
wires from mechanical damage. 

Some of the terminal resistors are located in the central gateway 
module and in the user devices. Since the surge impedance 
(impedance of high freguency lines) of the lines depends on exter¬ 
nal influencing factors, the terminating resistors are precisely 
matched to the reguired resistance. 

The sections of line to the user devices can be checked relatively 
easily by means of a resistance measuring instrument (ohmmeter, 
multimeter). The resistance should be measured from the central 
gateway module. Pin assignment, see 'BMW diagnostic system'. 

The terminal resistors in the FlexRay are located in the control 
units: 

• Central gateway module (ZGM) 

• Electronic Damper Control satellites. (EDC_AH) 

• Digital Motor Electronics (DME) 

• Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

• Rear-axle drift angle control (HSR) 

• Steering column switch cluster (SZL) 

• Lane change warning (SWW). 

Measurements on the FlexRay 

For resistance measurement in the FlexRay, be sure to observe the 
vehicle wiring diagram! The various termination options mean that 
misinterpretations of the measurement results can occur. 

Measuring the resistance of the FlexRay lines cannot provide a 
100% deduction in terms of the system wiring. In the case of dam¬ 
age such as pinching or connector corrosion, the resistance value 
may be within the tolerance when the system is static. 


In dynamic mode, however, electrical influences can cause 
increased surge resistance, resulting in data transmission prob¬ 
lems. 

It is possible to repair the FlexRay bus. If damaged, the cables can 
be connected using conventional cable connectors. Special 
reguirements, however, must be observed when reinstalling the 
system. 

The wiring of the FlexRay system consists of twisted lines. Where 
possible, this twisting should not be altered during repairs. 

Repaired areas with stripped insulation must be sealed again with 
shrink-fit tubing. Moisture can affect the surge resistance and 
therefore the efficiency of the bus system. 

Wake-up and Sleep Characteristics 

Although the FlexRay control units can be wakened per bus signal, 
most FlexRay control units are activated across an additional wake- 
up line by the CAS. The wake-up line has the same function as the 
previous wake-up line (15WUP) in the PT-CAN. 

The signal curve corresponds to the signal curve of the PT-CAN. 
The active steering and the VDM are not wakened via the wake-up 
cable, rather per bus signal. The four damper satellites are then 
activated directly by the VDM by switching the power supply. 



MOST Bus 


On the F01/F02, the MOST bus is, for the most part, identical to 
previous models with regard to operation and function. There are 
some changes unique to these models which are outlined below. 

The MOST Control Units and Light Direction 

In the F01/F02, the MOST bus is used for the components in 
information/communication systems. The CIO is used as the 
master control unit. 

Other bus users may be: 

• DVD changer 

• Instrument cluster 

• Top-HiFi amplifier 

• Satellite tuner SDARS (only US version) 

•Telephone. 

• Rear Seat Entertainment 

• ULF-SBX high 

The MOST programming access used in models to date is no 
longer required for the F01/F02. The programming now takes 
place on these vehicles via the Ethernet access point. 

Light Direction 

Data are always sent in one direction on the MOST bus. 

Each control unit can send data on the MOST bus. 

The physical light direction runs from the master control unit (Car 
Information Computer) to the DVD changer, to the instrument clus¬ 
ter, to the ZGM (Central Gateway Module) and from there to the 
fiber optic cable distributor/connector. All the control units fitted in 
the rear end are connected at the fiber optic cable distributor. From 
the last control unit, the light returns to the master control unit.

Fiber Optic Connector 

The use of the fiber optic connector provides the advantage of 
being able to easily retrofit control units in the area of the luggage 
compartment. 

The fiber optic cable connector is located in the luggage compart¬ 
ment of the F01/F02, to the left behind the side wall trim. 

The fiber optic cable connector is arranged in the MOST bus 
system between the front area of the vehicle (head unit, DVD 
changer) and the rear area of the vehicle (TCU,SBX etc.). 

Two fiber optic connectors are installed in the F01. One is respon¬ 
sible for the factory installed control units. The other is used for the 
preparations for options.

Sub-bus Systems 


Sub-bus systems exchange data within the system. These 
systems are used to exchange relatively small guantities of data 
in specific systems.

Explanation 

Index 

BSD 

9.6 kBits/s 

Linear, single wire 

LIN 

9.6/19.2/20.0 kBits 

Linear, single wire 

LoCAN 

500 kBits/s 

Linear, two wire 


BSD 

The bit-serial data interface BSD is also used on the F01/F02 
(due to lack of available interfaces). It makes the following connec¬ 
tions from the engine management to the corresponding sub 
systems: 

• Alternator regulator 

• Oil condition sensor 

K-bus Protocol 

The term "K-bus (protocol)" is used for a series of sub-bus 
systems in the bus overview. These sub-bus systems are used for 
various purposes. The K-bus protocol used here is a common 
component already used in predecessor models. The protocol is 
used, e.g. on the following systems: 

• Connection between ACSM and TCU 


Local CAN 

The Local-CAN serves to transfer the high data volumes of the 
following sensors to the ICM. 

• Short-range and long range radar sensors to the ICM. 

The Local-CAN has a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s and is 
designed as a twisted pair of wires. 

The terminal resistors in the Local-CAN are located in the ICM and 
the long range radar sensor: 


ICM 


SRR-L 


;.I SRR-R 

LIN bus 

The LIN bus has been used as early as the E60 and was also used 
to control the outside mirrors on the E46. Mainly, the versions V2.0 
or higher are used in the F01/F02. For the F01/F02, various 
connections per LIN bus are implemented: 

• E.g.: Footwell module to driver's door switch cluster 

• Connection from footwell module to the outside mirrors 

• Connection from roof functions center to rain-light-solar-con- 
densation sensor 


• Comfort Access 

• CAS bus 


• Activation of the 16 IHKA actuator motors per "daisy chain" 
assignment (series connection of the signal lines). 












Due to the lower data rate on the LIN bus, terminal resistors are not 
used. 

In the F01/F02, the following control units still correspond to the 
VI .x specification: 

• Belt hand-over 

• Outside mirror 

• Blower output stages 

• Intelligent Battery Sensor 

LINV2.0 (orV2.1) 

LIN components that correspond to the specification of data proto¬ 
col LIN V2.0 or higher have extended functions. 

• The LIN components for V2.x are delivered with a device ID 
and a base configuration. The final (dynamic) configuration 
and the allocation of the ID number take place on commis¬ 
sioning by the master control unit. 

If one of these components is replaced, this operation must be 
initiated manually by means of the BMW diagnosis system. 

• The data protocol has become more variable, permitting, if 
required, periodic alongside sporadic messages as of specifi¬ 
cation V2.0. These "sporadic frames" are only sent if the mas¬ 
ter control unit requires data from the secondary control units 
or outputs data. Without such a request, the time slots in the 
messages remain empty. 

• The master control units can send so-called multiple requests 
to secondary control unit groups. To reduce the bus load, the 
contacted secondary control units only respond in the case of 
changed values (e.g. door contact). 

All master control units of the LIN V2.x specification are 
downwardly compatible to (secondary control units) compo¬ 
nents of previous specifications. 


However, all V2.0 secondary control units also require a V2.x mas¬ 
ter controller. 

A number of the connected components are only diagnosis-capa¬ 
ble to a limited degree, for example the rain-light-solar-condensa¬ 
tion sensor. 

In this case, the master control unit serves as the gateway to the 
remaining bus system. The diagnosis requests from the ZGM or 
BMW diagnosis system are inserted in the sporadic section of a 
LIN frame. 

A special feature in the F01/F02 is that the data communication 
between the Comfort Access and diversity antenna is implemented 
with 20.0 kBit/s due to the large number of small data packages. 

The slightly higher transfer rate means that the time slots in the 
data protocol can be better exploited. The master control unit 
sends the "sleep command" to place the LIN in the idle state. 

The "sleep command" can also be sent with terminal R "On", e.g. 
for mirror adjustment. The "wake-up command" can also be sent 
by a secondary control unit. 

The LIN messages in the data protocol are divided into four 
sections: 

• Synchronization 

• Identifier 

• Data 

• Checksum

Battery Cables 

In the F01/F02, three main power lines on the underbody run from 
the distribution box at the battery to the engine compartment. 

One of the main power lines runs via the positive battery terminal to 
the starter motor and to the alternator. 

The second line powers the engine electronics (Electric coolant 
pump etc). The third line runs to the distribution box in the engine 
compartment. This distribution box supplies the electric fan with 
power. 


This line is safeguarded by the high-current fuse (100 A) in the dis¬ 
tribution box at the battery. Depending on the model of vehicle, 
different line cross sections are used. 



In addition, a battery cable is routed to the front fuse carrier through 
the vehicle interior. The transfer points for the main power cables 
are located in the luggage compartment. The main power lines on 
the underbody are laid in a protected area to prevent damage. 

Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS) 

The intelligent battery sensor (IBS) is a mechatronic component for 
monitoring the battery status. The following physical measure¬ 
ments are recorded for the battery: 

• Current 

• Voltage 

• Terminal temperature 

The term "intelligent" means that there is a microprocessor 
integrated in the IBS. This microprocessor calculates and analyzes 
time critical measured variables. The results are then forwarded to 
the higher-level control units (i.e. DME) via the LIN bus.

Bus Overview and Terminal Status 

The F01/F02 introduces new designations for some of the 
terminals. A distinction is also made between logical terminals and 
power supply terminals. 

The logical terminals do not serve as power supply terminals; 
instead, they represent a status. They are activated/deactivated by 
pressing the START-STOP button. 

The logical terminals are: 

• Terminal R 

• Terminal 15 

• Terminal 50. 

The power supply terminals on the F01 has been changed, the 


following table reflects the changes:

For clearer illustration of terminal shut-down, the control units are 
identified by a colored triangle. Identification and allocation to the 
individual terminals are shown in the diagram below.

F01 


Terminal 15N 

Terminal 15N is used to supply power to control units and compo¬ 
nents that are only intended to be active when the vehicle is being 
driven, e.g. PDC. 

The letter N stands for "Nachlauf", meaning "overrun". The power 
supply Terminal 15N is switched on and off by means of the logical 
Terminal 15. The overrun time after Terminal 15N is switched off is 
5 seconds. That time is required so that the control units have 
enough time to save their data. While Terminal 15N is active, 
Terminal 30B and Terminal 30F are also active. 

Terminal 30B 

Terminal 30B supplies power to control units and electrical 
components that are reguired when the driver is present. 

The letter B stands for "Basic mode". 

Terminal 30B is activated by: 

• Pressing the buttons on the radio remote control 

• Unlocking/locking/double-locking the vehicle 

• Pressing the START-STOP button 

• Change of door switch status, change of trunk 
switch status, change of side window position 

• Bus message. 

Regular deactivation by: 

• Vehicle double-locked and trunk closed 
(one minute overrun) 

• Vehicle not double-locked or trunk open 
(30 minutes overrun). 


oook

F01 Workbook - Module 1 


Other possible deactivation triggers: 

• Upper starting capacity limit reached (one minute overrun) 

• "Powerdown": diagnosis command for purposes of measuring 
closed-circuit (10 seconds overrun) 

• Transport mode (one minute overrun). 

While Terminal 30B is active, Terminal 30F is also active. 

Terminal 30F 

Terminal 30F supplies power to control units and electrical devices 
that are also required when the driver is not present but which can 
be switched off in the event of a fault. 

All control units that are not supplied by Terminal 15N or Terminal 
30B, are not responsible for vehicle access and do not have to 
meet a legal requirement for permanent operation. 

The letter F stands for "Fault". 

Terminal 30F is activated by: 

• Pressing the buttons on the radio remote control 

• Unlocking/locking/double-locking the vehicle 

• Pressing the START-STOP button 

• Change of door switch status, change of trunk switch status, 
change of side window position 

• Bus message. 

In the event of a fault (closed-circuit current too high, bus wake-up, 
sleep-mode inhibitor, start capacity limit reached) Terminal 30F is 
reset for 10 seconds. 


Terminal 30F is not reset or switched off if at least one of the 
following conditions is met: 

• Terminal 30B active 

• Parking lights switched on 

• Side lights switched on 

• Flazard warning lights switched on 

• If an extended overrun time for Terminals 30B and 30F is 
demanded by a service message from any of a number of 
control units. 

Example: when the engine is warm, it can be necessary for 
the electric fan to run on for up to 11 minutes after the vehicle 
is parked and locked. In order for the electric fan to be operat¬ 
ed, the engine management module must be supplied with 
power. Since the overrun time in that case is only three min¬ 
utes (that is currently the short overrun time for Terminal 30B, 
not one minute), the DME requests the appropriate extension 
byway of a bus message when the engine is switched off. 

• "Sticking relay" detected. 

Terminal 30F is switched off if Terminal 30B is off and at least one 
of the following conditions is met: 

• Starting capacity limit reached 

• Another 10 bus wake-ups have occurred after Terminal 30F 
reset 

• Unexplained bus activity after Terminal 30F reset 

• Violation of closed-circuit current limit detected after Terminal 
30F reset.

F01 


Terminal Relays 

The F01/F02 has various relays for switching off the power supply 
to most control units. The Junction box module controls the 
bistable relays for Terminal 30F but receives the request from the 
central gateway module (ZGM) or IBS. 

• ZGM: 

If sleep mode inhibited or on occurrence of unauthorized 
wake-up. ZGM monitors the vehicle status and registers 
inhibited sleep mode or unauthorized wake-up after Terminal 
30B is switched off. 

• IBS: 

If closed-circuit current limit violated or starting capacity limit 
reached. 

The computation for activating the Terminal 30F relay takes place 
on two control units. The ZGM monitors the following activities: 

• Invalid wake-up procedures within the bus systems 

• Sleep blockers (control units that constantly keep the bus 
systems active).

The ECM (DME) continuously reads and assesses the battery data. 
The relay is also switched off when the starting capability limit of 
the vehicle battery is reached. 

The Terminal 30F relay is a bistable relay and is always in the ON 
state under normal conditions. It switches off the connected 
electric loads only in the case of fault. Once the Terminal 30F relay 
has been switched off, one of the switch-on conditions must be 
met before it can be switched on again. 

General Measures 

The terminals "load shut-down" and the terminal "interior lighting" 
are switched off as a general measure when the vehicle is in 
stationary mode. This occurs only when the vehicle is not locked 
and secured. These loads are shut down immediately when the 
vehicle is locked and secured. This measure affects the following 
electric loads:

Interior lighting 
(front and rear)

Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS) 

The intelligent battery sensor has a similar range of functions to the 
intelligent battery sensor on previous models. A new feature is 
data transmission between the IBS and the ECM (DME) via LIN 
bus and the wake-up function of the IBS.

Wake-up line 




The time reguired to take the readings is approximately 50 millisec¬ 
onds. The measured data is stored on the IBS in the memory for 
recording the closed-circuit current. 

The wake-up function applies only when the vehicle is in idle 
mode. If the IBS detects a wake-up trigger, the Junction box 
module is woken up by a PWM signal. The IBS is directly connect¬ 
ed to the Junction box module via a separate lead. 


The pulse duty factor indicates the reason for the wake-up: 


Duty factor

Starting capacity limit 1

Raised closed-circuit current 


A wake-up due to raised closed-circuit current can take place up to 
three times. Depending on the vehicle status and reason for the 
wake-up, the Junction box module performs one of the following 
actions: 

• Wakes up the vehicle so that the DME can send shut-down 
commands to electrical devices that are operating while the 
vehicle is in parked mode 

• Resets Terminal 30F (without waking up the vehicle) 

• Switches off Terminal 30F (without waking up the vehicle). 

A fault memory entry is registered in each case. 


$ 


Wake-up Function 

When the vehicle is in idle mode, the IBS continuously records the 
data relevant to the battery indicators. The IBS is programmed to 
wake up every 14 seconds in order to update the measured data 
by taking new readings. 


F01 Workbook - Module 1 

71 

























F01 


Commissioning 

The IBS is fully functional as soon as it is completely connected, 
i.e. it can immediately detect the basic variables, current, voltage 
and temperature. 

However, the variables derived from those readings for the 
purposes of power management, i.e. battery condition, starting 
capacity, etc., must first be recalculated and, therefore, there is a 
time lag before they are available. 

When the engine is restarted, the DME reads off the closed-circuit 
current progression. If it diverges from the defined closed-circuit 
current progression, a fault is registered in the DME fault memory. 

In the period between "Engine OFF" and when the DME main 
relay is switched off, the IBS is informed by the DME as to the 
maximum charge that can be drawn from the battery on the basis 
of ensuring that the engine can be reliably restarted. 

After the DME main relay is switched off, the IBS continually 
checks the battery charge level (SOC) and the closed-circuit 
current. 


Junction Box Module 

The Junction box module is 
responsible for switching the 
Terminal 30F relay and for 
storing information (history data 
and fault memory entries) 
related to energy management. 

As part of vehicle diagnostics, 
these data can be used to eval¬ 
uate faults and to analyze the 
vehicle battery. 




- Module 1 


72 


Engine Management (power management) 

The (power management) software for controlling the energy 
balance is located in the engine management (DME). On the basis 
of that control algorithm, various electrical devices in the vehicle's 
electrical system are switched off by the CAS control unit via the 
Terminal 30B relay or by the Central Gateway Module and engine 
management module via the Terminal 30F relay. The power man¬ 
agement is additionally responsible for evaluating and storing the 
IBS data. 







Transport Mode 

The batteries in vehicles coming off the production line are 
adequately charged so that SOC > 80 % (SOC = "State of 
charge"). 

However, since several days or weeks can pass between the time 
the vehicle comes off the production line and when it is delivered 
to the customer, the battery will have discharged to a greater or 
lesser degree. Therefore, every battery must be charged according 
to the recharging calendar. 


The F01/F02 is the first model on which it is possible to display the 
charge level of the battery when the new car is being transported.

Note: If the SOC has dropped to less than 35 %, the indica¬ 
tion continues to be displayed on the instrument 
cluster until the battery is replaced and a change of 
battery is registered. 

Note: When transport mode is reset, there is no indication 
on the instrument cluster of the battery charge level. 

Note: If the vehicle is delivered with the red Check Control 
message “Battery charge level very low” active, it is 
essential that the low battery charge is recorded as 
“transport damage” on the delivery note. 

In such cases, the test module “Energy diagnosis” 
must be carried out to establish the cause. 

Replace the battery before handing over the vehicle 
to the customer and register the change of battery 
using the service function. 

Note: If a vehicle is delivered with the yellow Check Control 
message "Charge battery", this should also be 
recorded on the delivery note. The battery must then 
be charged once and an energy diagnosis carried out. 


When production or transport mode is activated, a Check Control 
message is generated that provides a quick indication of the bat¬ 
tery condition.

is switched off after an overrun period of 8 minutes. It is activated

Electrical System and Battery Diagnosis 

Over the past few years, the energy management of all BMW 
models has been continuously improved and standardized across 
the various model series. In terms of energy diagnosis, this also 
means standardization of testing schedules and displays in the 
BMW diagnostic system. 

The aim of the diagnostic procedures is to show the causes of a 
discharged battery as unambiguously as possible. In view of the 
complexity, especially in the area of energy management, the 
specific cause of a fault can be shown only partially depending on 
its nature. 


The originator and reason for wake-up (unauthorized wake-up) 
are stored as additional information in the ZGM fault memory. 
The driving profile for the last 5 weeks is stored in the JBE 
energy history memory. The energy history memory is referred 
to for energy diagnosis purposes. 

More information on the subject of energy management on the 
F01/F02 can be found in the BMW Diagnosis System. 



The acquired energy diagnosis data are shown if the fault cannot 
be clearly assigned based on the acquired data. Power manage¬ 
ment is retained in full while the expanded diagnostic options are 
now resident in the history memory. 

ZGM monitors the vehicle status, registers inhibited sleep mode or 
unauthorized wakeup after Terminal 30B is switched off and 
requests a reset or shut-down of Terminal 30F by a bus message 
to the JBE.

Car Access System 


CAS 4 

The Car Access System introduced on the F01 is now the 4th 
generation. There are several changes as compared to past 
vehicles which include: 

• Integration of the Comfort Access functions into CAS 4 

• Passive Go is now standard equipment (1 st time for BMW) 

• Elimination of slot for ID transmitter (key) 

Comfort Access remains an option, but Passive go is standard. 
Therefore, the ID transmitter only needs to be somewhere inside 
the passenger compartment for the engine to be started.

The ID transmitter is fitted with a battery which has a life of 
approximately four years. Up to eight ID transmitters can be used 
for a particular vehicle. Four of the eight ID transmitters can be 
used for personal profiles. 

Functional Overview 

The Car Access System 4 provides, among other things, the 
central control unit for vehicle access and vehicle locking. 
Consequently, the CAS 4 has complete control over central 
locking. 

The CAS 4 has sole knowledge of the system and decides 
whether, for instance, to allow access to the vehicle or not. 

In other words, whether to unlock the vehicle or not. That function 
is referred to as a master function. 

The Car Access System 4 incorporates the following master 
functions on the F01/F02: 

• Comfort Access 

• Central locking 

• Power windows 

• Sliding/tilting sunroof 

• Terminal control 

• Electronic immobilizer 4 

Other functions of the CAS 4 include: 

• Vehicle data storage 

• Data transmission for Condition Based Service (CBS). 

• Checking plausibility of remote control signals. 
















The Car Access System 4 enables or disables the execution of a 
number of functions. However, other control units may be involved 
in the execution of the function. A selection of them is listed in the 
table below.

Central locking 

FRM 

Power windows 

FZD 

Sliding/tilting sunroof 


For the purposes of communication with other electrical-system 
devices, the CAS 4 is connected to the K-CAN2, CAS bus and LIN 
bus. 


The Car Access System 4 analyzes the status of the hood switch 
and broadcasts this information for use by the alarm system. 

The Car Access System 4 also analyzes the status of the following 
buttons and initiates the central locking function: 

• Center Lock button, locking/unlocking central locking 

• Interior trunk release button on A-pillar, unlocking trunk 

• Central double-locking button, locking and double-locking 
vehicle doors using button on underside of open trunk 

• Hotel setting switch, preventing trunk unlocking function. 

The Car Access System 4 provides the power supply for the brake 
light switch and also analyzes its status. 

The sections that follow describe some of the functions of the Car 
Access System. Those functions are: 

• Terminal control 

• Electronic immobilizer 

• Gearbox enable 

• Vehicle data storage. 


ID transmitter search in passenger compartment 

When the START-STOP button is pressed, it triggers the search for 
an ID transmitter in the passenger compartment. The passenger 
compartment search is reguired for the Passive Go function in 
order that starting can be enabled. 

When performing the passenger compartment search, the CAS 4 
issues a reguest for an ID transmitter to register with the vehicle. 

There are two antennas provided for the passenger compartment 
search. One antenna covers the front of the passenger compart¬ 
ment and the other the rear. The antennas are connected to the 
CAS 4. 

The CAS 4 sends out a signal with a freguency of 125 KHz 
through the antennas. That signal triggers the ID transmitter to 
register with the vehicle. 

The ID transmitter responds with an encrypted radio signal. 

The remote control receiver in the diversity module passes the 
radio signal information to the CAS 4 via the LIN bus. 

The CAS checks whether the ID transmitter belongs to the vehicle. 
Subseguent communication takes place on the ID transmitter's 
transmission freguency, e.g. 315 MHz 

The CAS 4 checks whether the ID transmitter matches the vehicle. 
If the check is positive, the CAS 4 enables terminal control. 

The individual terminals can then be selected. 

Note: If communication with the ID transmitter can not be 
established, a Check Control message is displayed 
on the instrument cluster. The driver is notified that 
no ID transmitter could be located inside the passen¬ 
ger compartment. 

The ID transmitter can be held in the position marked on the 
steering column. There is an emergency start coil under the steer¬ 
ing column trim. Communication between the CAS 4 and the ID 
transmitter can be established via the emergency start coil.

The Car Access System 4 (2) is responsible for terminal control. 
For instance "Terminal 15 ON" is made available to the intelligent 
battery sensor (4). The terminal statuses, e.g. "Terminal 15 
ON/Terminal 0", can be selected by means of the START-STOP 
button (11). In conjunction with the digital motor electronics (3), 
the Car Access System 4 issues the start enabling signal for the 
starter motor (5).

Electronic Immobilizer 4 


The EWS 4 was first introduced with the Car Access System 3 on 
the E92 and the latest version is a derivation of that design. 

Design of the EWS 4 System 

The vehicle immobilizer consists of the identification transmitter 
which identifies itself to the vehicle and therefore to the CAS 4. 

The CAS 4 system exchanges data via the CAS bus with the digital 
motor electronics in order to cancel the immobilizer function.

The software for the electronic immobilizer and for enabling engine 
starting is incorporated in the Car Access System 4. 

Enabling of ignition and fuel injection is the responsibility of the 
digital motor electronics. Before the electronic immobilizer issues 
the enabling signal for starting, the ID transmitter must be identified 
as matching the vehicle. 


F01 


As soon as an attempt is made to start the engine, a check 
(authentication) has to be carried out. That check establishes 
whether a matching ID transmitter is located in the passenger 
compartment. The vehicle can be started if the check is success¬ 
ful. Authentication starts with the status "Terminal 15 ON". 

Note: The ID transmitter also has to identify itself to the 
vehicle and, therefore, to the Car Access System 4. 

Note: The time taken to search for an ID transmitter in the 
passenger compartment may result in a delay before 
engine starting is enabled. That delay may occur in a 
time span of up to half a second. 

Start enable through the electronic vehicle immobilizer 

The start procedure is enabled by means of a special reguest and 
response procedure known as challenge-response. 

As of "Terminal 15 ON", the digital motor electronics sends an 
encrypted random number to the CAS 4. The digital motor elec¬ 
tronics uses a random number generator to generate the random 
number. 

On the basis of that random number and its secret key, the CAS 4 
calculates a response and sends it to the digital motor electronics. 
In the meantime, the digital motor electronics calculates the 
expected response from the random number and its secret key. 


jook 

83 


- Module 1 

















84 

F01 Workbook - Module 1 


The CAS 4 and the digital motor electronics use the same secret 
key and algorithm for the calculations. If the figure that the CAS 4 
sends to the digital motor electronics matches the figure calculated 
by the motor electronics, the electronic immobilizer is deactivated. 
The engine can now be started. 

Note: As from "Terminal 15 ON", a cyclic query (challenge- 
response) is performed as long as the engine is not 
yet running. 

Data Transmission 

Data transmission is redundant via the bus systems. 

The signal from the digital motor electronics, for instance, reaches 
the CAS via both the K-CAN2 and the CAS bus. The digital motor 
electronics, however, is connected to the PT-CAN. 

For that reason, the signal is transferred from PT-CAN to the 
K-CAN 2 by the central gateway module. The time taken by the 
signals via the different bus systems is of no conseguence as the 
signal that reaches the digital motor electronics first used for the 
electronic immobilizer. 

The authentication is repeated in response to following events: 

• Transmission and response time exceeded 

• Transmission problems 

• Response with the secret security code incorrect (e.g. incor¬ 
rect secret key due to control unit from another vehicle). 

Secret Key 

The control units are assigned a secret key on the assembly line. 
This secret key is generated from a random number. The secret 
key is valid for a pair of control units and linked to the specific 
vehicle. This means that one pair of control units receives the same 
secret key. 


Once the secret key has been entered, the control unit is locked. 
From this point on, the control unit is permanently tied to this 
secret key and the vehicle. 

The CAS 4 and the digital motor electronics form a control unit 
pairing. 

Note: Since the control units are assigned to the specific 
vehicle, replacement with a unit from another vehicle 
is not possible. 

When replacing a control unit, the new control unit 
must be ordered from BMW. Matching of the control 
units to each other is no longer necessary. 

Gearbox Enable 

The enable is based on a procedure similar to that used for the 
electronic vehicle immobilizer 3. 

As of "Terminal 15 ON", the CAS 4 sends encrypted individual 
codes to the transmission control unit. The signal is applied to the 
PT-CAN 2 by the digital motor electronics. 

The electronic transmission control deciphers and checks these 
individual codes. If the check is successful, the gearbox control 
unit will enable the gearbox functions. 

The electronic gearbox control unit forms a pair of control units 
together with the CAS 4. 

Start Value Matching 

A start value matching procedure between the CAS 4 and the 
electronic transmission control is performed on the assembly line. 
That involves the CAS 4 transferring an encrypted individual code 
to the transmission control unit. 

Conseguently, the electronic transmission control knows the 
individual code and can check whether the gearbox functions can 
be enabled. 



Components of the Car Access System 

CAS 4 

Due to the integration of the Passive Go function, the START-STOP 
button is now connected to the Car Access System 4 via the 
instrument panel wiring harness. 

The CAS has a separate connector socket for the Comfort Access 
system. The CAS 4 has three connector sockets in all. 


Note: The instrument panel is pre-assembled so that it is 
fitted in the car as a complete unit on the assembly 
line. For that reason, the Car Access System 4 has 
only one connector for the main wiring harness. 

All other connectors are connected up during pre¬ 
assembly of the instrument panel. 

On vehicles without Comfort Access, the Car Access System does 
not have the Comfort Access connector socket (2). 

START-STOP Button 

The START-STOP button is integrated in the instrument panel. 

In contrast with the previous connection, the ribbon cable has been 
eliminated. 


Emergency Start Coil 

In unfavorable situations, the system may not be able to find the ID 
transmitter in the passenger compartment. For that reason, the 
Car Access System initiates display of a message on the instru¬ 
ment cluster. 

The message notifies the 
driver that no ID transmitter 
could be located inside the 
passenger compartment. 

Since the F01/F02 does not 
have a slot for the ID transmit¬ 
ter, there is an emergency 
start coil (1) on the steering 
column. 

The emergency start coil can be used to communicate with the ID 
transmitter so that the engine can still be started and the vehicle 
driven. 

The emergency start coil is eguivalent to the function of the 
transponder coil. By communicating via the transponder coil, the 
Car Access System 4 is able to identify a valid ID transmitter. 

Thus the Car Access System 4 is able to issue the start enabling 
signal following successful identification. 

In the following situations, for example, the system may not be 
able to find the ID transmitter: 

• ID transmitter defective 

• Interference with radio transmission to ID transmitter 

• Discharged battery in ID transmitter.

Remote Control Receiver 

The remote control receiver now has a transmitter and receiver unit 
and is integrated in the diversity module. As a result, bi-directional 
communication can be established between the ID transmitter and 
the remote-control receiver. 

The remote control receiver now also has a LIN bus connection. 
The remote control receiver uses that LIN bus connection to wake 
up the Car Access System 4. 

In that case, the Car Access System 4 asks the remote control 
receiver if there is a message waiting. That message may contain a 
reguest to unlock the vehicle. The Car Access System checks, for 
instance, whether the ID transmitter belongs to the vehicle. 

If the check is positive, the Car Access System 4 initiates unlocking 
of the vehicle. 

Note: As a LIN-bus device, the remote control receiver is an 
input capable of waking up the Car Access System. 

Input Components 

The Car Access System 4 analyzes buttons for the central locking 
functions. All buttons connect to ground. That means that the Car 
Access System 4 receives a low signal when the button is pressed. 

The buttons concerned are: 

• Center-lock button 

• Interior trunk release button on A- pillar 

• Central double-locking button on underside of trunk 

• Hotel setting switch 

• Hood switch (alarm system). 


Vehicle Data Storage 

The Car Access System 4 stores the following vehicle data: 

• Personal Profile, the Car Access System 4 stores data for the 
Personal Profile 

• Vehicle order, the vehicle order is stored in the footwell module 

• Redundant data storage for instrument cluster 

• Data for condition-based service CBS 

• Service key data (e.g. data for Condition Based Service, 
fault memory entries, Check Control messages, etc.) 

• Authentication for diagnostic access to the CAS 4 

The Car Access System's temporary memory permanently stores 
data such as the Condition Based Service version, the vehicle 
identification number (VIN), software version, etc. 

The Car Access System receives current data from the electrical 
system, such as outside temperature, engine temperature, date, 
time and odometer reading, via the K-CAN2. 

The Car Access System collects that information. Under certain 
conditions, the data is transferred to the ID transmitter. In that way, 
the service key data is kept up to date for readout when the vehicle 
is taken in for servicing. 



Updating Service Data 

The service data records and fault memory entries are collected in 
a temporary memory by the CAS. The service data is thus 
available from a central point.

Updating can be performed both byway of the emergency start 
coil's low freguency signal (5) and by means of the transmission 
freguency used by the ID transmitter (6). 


Updating Service Key Data 

The service key data is stored in the Car Access System and trans¬ 
ferred to the ID transmitter. Transfer is initiated automatically by 
specific conditions or manually. The data can be read out using 
the BMW Key Reader when the vehicle is serviced.

Automatic Updating 

The service key data is updated every time the vehicle is driven. 
That data compromises: 


• Condition Based Service data 


• Check Control messages 

• Fault memory entries. 


F01 Workbook - Module 1

88 

F01 Workbook - Module 1 


The conditions for updating are: 

• "Terminal 15 ON", speed above 25 mph followed by speed 
below 25 mph. 

• The data is updated once a distance of 5 miles has been 
covered and the speed is below 25 mph. 

• The remote control receiver transfers the data to the ID 
transmitter when the engine is switched off. Data continues to 
be written to the ID transmitter even after it is taken out of the 
vehicle. 

• A data read-out can then be obtained from the ID transmitter. 

Manual Updating 

The procedure for transferring current service key data to the ID 
transmitter in the course of servicing is as follows: 

• Press and hold the Center-Lock button and use the START- 
STOP button to select "Terminal 15 ON", then release both 
buttons. 

• Within 10 seconds, hold the ID transmitter against the 
right-hand side of the steering column trim in the position 
marked by the key symbol. 

The key symbol is printed on the steering column trim. 

Wait until the Check Control message appears on the 
instrument cluster. The instrument cluster display shows the 
message "Updating service data". 

• As soon as the updating process is complete, the Check 
Control message disappears and a gong sounds. 

• Data can then be obtained from the ID transmitter. 

The manual updating process transfers Condition Based Service 
data, Check Control messages and fault memory entries. 


Control Unit Replacement 

A defect in the control units belonging to the EWS represents a 
challenge for the Service technician. Since a defective control 
module cannot be replaced by control modules from other vehicles 
particular care is necessary when performing the diagnostic proce¬ 
dure. 

A defective control unit can be ordered through spare part chan¬ 
nels. However, it is important to bear in mind that the digital motor 
electronics and the Car Access System 4 are supplied ready- 
coded for the vehicle. 

This has the advantage that only the control unit is replaced and 
the matching procedure with the electronic vehicle immobilizer is 
not necessary. 

There is no point in ordering a control unit to be kept in stock as 
the secret key is assigned to the control unit and the vehicle. 

A matching procedure is necessary for the electronic transmission 
control after replacement. As part of this procedure, the Car 
Access System 4 transfers the individual code to the electronic 
transmission control. 

The matching procedure can take several minutes.

Electronic Systems 


Comfort Access System 

The F01/F02 will have Comfort Access as an option from the start 
of series production. It is part of the “Convenience Package”. 

The Comfort Access in the F01/F02 is based on preceding 
systems and is adapted to the F01/F02. The following points 
should be noted: 

• The entire function of Comfort Access is now located in the 
CAS 4. 

• There is no separate control unit for Comfort Access in the 
F01/F02, in contrast to previous systems. 

• Passive Go is standard equipment as there is no slot for the 
ID transmitter. 

• The ID transmitter must be located in the vehicle interior in 
order for the engine to be started. The engine can now be 
started by pressing the START-STOP button and the vehicle 
is ready to be driven. 

Comfort Access includes the following functions: 

• Passive Entry, enables access to the vehicle without active 
use of the ID transmitter. 

• Passive Go, the Passive Go function allows the vehicle to be 
started when a valid ID transmitter is located in the passenger 
compartment. (This is a standard feature in F01/F02) 

• Passive Exit, makes it possible to lock the vehicle without 
actively using the ID transmitter.

Location of Antennas 

For Comfort Access, 5 antennas are installed for the vehicle interior 
and 3 antennas are installed for the vehicle exterior. 


The antennas for the exterior are installed in the door sills on each 
side of the vehicle. 

The antenna for the rear of the vehicle is located in the bumper. 
The exterior antennas are designed to give a coverage area of 1.5 
meters (about 5 feet). 

The outside door handle electronics provide the Car Access 
System with the signal from the capacitive sensor and the piezo 
sensor. 

As far as the 5 interior antennas are concerned, there are 2 in the 
luggage compartment and 1 in the parcel shelf. One is located in 
the front of the center console and one in the rear of the console. 

The transmission frequency for the antennas is 125 kHz. 

All messages sent are encrypted.

Operation of Central Locking 

The Car Access System (4) evaluates the signal from the ID trans¬ 
mitter (1) and requests the unlocking or locking of the vehicle. 

The junction-box electronics module (8) executes the requests. 

The lock cylinder (12) in the driver's door is used for mechanically 
unlocking or locking the door. 

The footwell module (10) evaluates the movement (status of Hall 
sensors) of the lock cylinder and the status of the door contacts. 

The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the rear 
window antenna. The remote control receiver integrated in the 
diversity module (19) forwards the signal to the CAS (2). 

After the signal has been successfully checked, the CAS issues a 
request for control of the central locking system. The CAS is the 
master control unit for the central locking system. 

The junction-box electronics module (4) executes the unlocking or 
locking of the vehicle. 

The footwell module (1) evaluates the status of all door contacts 
(6, 8, 14 and 16). It communicates the current status on the 
K-CAN 2. 

This means, for example, that the CAS is able to prevent locking 
when the driver's door is open. The status of the center-lock but¬ 
ton (3) is evaluated by the CAS and communicated over the 
K-CAN 2. 

Depending on the status, the JB electronics module activates 
central locking. The junction-box electronics modules is also 
responsible for registering the status and activating central locking 
in the trunk. 

The junction-box electronics module is also responsible for control¬ 
ling the fuel filler flap (10). The footwell module evaluates the sig¬ 
nals from the Hall sensors for the lock cylinder (16) and makes this 
information available on the K-CAN2. 


With this information, the CAS knows the status of the door lock in 
the driver's door. This is important if a request is issued to unlock 
or lock the vehicle using the ID transmitter, for example. 

The central locking button is integrated in the underside of the 
trunk lid and is part of the Comfort Access option.

Power Windows 

The F01/F02 is fitted with electric power windows. The electric 
power windows have the following functions: 

• One-touch opening and closing 

• Toll opening and closing 

• Auto-remote opening and closing. 

The CAS 4 is the central control function for electric opening and 
closing of the windows. 

The FRM and JB electronics are responsible for the execution and 
activation of the power window motors. 

The footwell module and the junction box electronics monitor the 
motor speed of the respective power window motors. 

In this arrangement, the FRM or JB electronics can respond to 
overheating or possible blocking of the power window motors in 
the event of an object being trapped in the windows. 

The signal from the power window switch can pass through differ¬ 
ent bus systems until the desired window is opened or closed. 

Activation Example 

The driver's door switch block is connected via the LIN bus to the 
FRM. The signal is routed via the LIN bus to the FRM when the 
power window switch for the window in the passenger's door is 
operated. 

The FRM drives the power window motor. The same applies for 
the window in the driver's door. 

The signal is routed from the driver's door switch cluster via the LIN 
bus to the FRM when the power window switches for the windows 
in the rear doors are operated. The FRM sends the signal via the 
K-CAN to the JB electronics. The JB electronics receives the sig¬ 
nal and activates the corresponding power window motor.

Power Window Operation 

The Car Access System (2) issues the enable to actuate the power 
window motors (5, 7, 12 and 14). 

If a power window switch is then activated, the FRM (1) (front 
power window motor) or the JB electronics (3) (rear power window 
motor) executes the request. 

Examples of the Signal Path 

The following examples of a signal path show the path taken by the 
signal before the power window motor opens or closes the window. 
The CAS 4 has issued the enable to operate the power windows. 

Driver's door switch cluster 

When the power window switch for the window in the driver's door 
or front passenger's door is operated, the signal is routed via the 
LIN bus to the FRM. The FRM drives the corresponding power 
window motor. 

The signal is routed from the driver's door switch cluster via the LIN 
bus to the FRM when the power window switches for the windows 
in the rear doors are operated. 

The FRM sends the signal via the K-CAN 2 to the JB electronics. 
The JB electronics receives the signal and activates the correspon¬ 
ding power window motor. 

Power window switch, front passenger's door 

The signal is routed to the JB electronics when the power window 
switch in the front passenger's door is operated. 


Byway of example, the opening and closing procedure for one of 
the rear windows is illustrated by the signal path in the following 
graphic. The opening or closing function is initiated from the 
driver's door switch cluster.

Sliding/Tilting Sunroof 

The slide/tilt sunroof is standard on the F01/F02. Several control 
units are involved in the operation of the slide/tilt sunroof. 

The following points should be noted: 

• The sunroof utilizes 2 motors, one for the glass and one for 
the shade 

• The FZD controls and monitors both motors for the sunroof 

• The CAS communicates with the FZD for sunroof operation 
via the central locking system 

• The FRM supplies the signal from the door contacts. 

• The Junction Box electronics provide the power supply for the 
motors via terminal 30. 

• The DSC acguires the signals from the wheel speed sensors 
while the ICM makes available the speed signal to the vehicle 
electrical system for the operation of the wind deflector. 

Slide/tilt Sunroof Operating Concept 

The button for operating the slide/tilt sunroof has three directions 
of movement. In addition to the manual and overpress functions, 
the button has a double-click function in the three movement 
directions: 

• Manual, means opening or closing until the button is released. 

• Overpress function, means opening or closing using the one- 
touch control function 

• Double-click function, means that the button is pressed twice 
within a short time into the overpress position or into the tilt 
position. This enables the slide/tilt sunroof to be opened and 
closed automatically from any position. 

While moving, the slide/tilt sunroof can be stopped by pressing the 
button in the opposite direction.

Alarm System (DWA) 


Alarm System Schematic 


The DWA system is standard equipment in the F01 and F02 and 
is functionally the same as previous models. 

There are a few points to note: 

• The ultrasonic interior sensor is entirely integrated in the roof 
function center (FZD). 

• The emergency power siren and combined tilt sensor is locat¬ 
ed near the rear wheel arch. 

• It is not possible to activate the alarm system when the 
Terminal R or Terminal 15 signal is present. 

Overview 

The anti-theft alarm system is a standard feature. The task of the 
anti-theft alarm system is to indicate unauthorized access to the 
vehicle by emitting an alarm. 

The alarm can be triggered both audibly and visually. To do this, 
however, the alarm system must be activated. When activated, the 
alarm monitors the whole of the vehicle interior. 

In addition the alarm system monitors the engine compartment and 
the vehicle's rest position. In order that nothing can be stolen from 
the trunk, the alarm system monitors opening of the trunk lid. 

The alarm also signals an attempt to tamper with the vehicle, e.g. 
cutting of the supply line to the emergency power siren. 

The alarm system's ultrasonic interior movement detector is entire¬ 
ly integrated in the roof function center (FZD). 

The ultrasonic signal passes into the inside of vehicle through 
apertures in the grille of the roof function center. The emergency 
power siren and combined tilt sensor is located near the rear wheel 
arch.

The alarm system on the F01/F02 uses an ultrasonic interior 
movement detector (USIS) for monitoring the vehicle interior. 

The USIS is fully integrated in the FZD. 

The door switches (6, 7, 11, 12, Hall-effect sensors) are monitored 
by the FRM (13). As soon as the status of a Hall-effect sensor 
changes, the ultrasonic interior movement detector (14) receives 
that information via the K-CAN2. If the DWA system is activated, 
an alarm is triggered. 

The hood switch (1) is monitored by the CAS 4 (2). If the status 
changes, an alarm is triggered in the same way. Opening of the 
trunk lid is monitored by the JB electronics (4). If the status of the 
trunk-lid switch (10) changes, it triggers an alarm. 


Activating the Anti-theft Alarm 

The anti-theft alarm system is activated when the vehicle is 
centrally locked. Activation can be triggered by the following 
components: 

• Driver's door lock barrel 

• ID transmitter 

• Outside door handle with Comfort Access (sensitive surface). 

After the vehicle has been centrally locked, the emergency power 
siren is first activated together with the tilt alarm sensor. Then, the 
signals from all door switches, the hood switch and the trunk-lid 
switch are checked for plausibility. 

Once the contacts are set, they are then linked to the vehicle moni¬ 
toring system by the anti-theft alarm system. 

The tilt sensor and the ultrasonic interior movement detector must 
be adjusted to the vehicle's situation each time the vehicle is 
centrally double-locked. This is called initializing. 

The tilt alarm sensor delivers information on the vehicle's rest posi¬ 
tion. If this value is plausible, the tilt alarm sensor is included in the 
vehicle monitoring process. 

The alarm system's ultrasonic interior movement detector monitors 
the passenger compartment. It therefore takes a little time before 
the ultrasonic interior movement detector can actively be used for 
the anti-theft alarm system. The ultrasonic interior movement 
detector is switched to 'activated' approximately 30 seconds after 
the contacts have been linked to the alarm system.

Deactivating tilt sensor and ultrasonic interior sensor (USIS) 

It is advisable to deactivate the tilt sensor and USIS in the following 
situations: 

• Vehicle parked on slanted surface 

• Vehicle on ship transport 

• Vehicle on car transporter 

• Persons or animals in vehicle. 

Deactivation is performed by centrally double-locking or auto¬ 
remote closing the vehicle a second time within 10 seconds of 
doing so the first time. To acknowledge, the alarm system LED is lit 
for 2 seconds. 

Deactivating the anti-theft alarm system 

The anti-theft alarm system is deactivated by the "unlock" or 
"selective unlock" central locking functions. An audible and/or 
visual signal can be output in connection with deactivating corre¬ 
sponding to the country specific version. 

If an alarm was triggered during the time when the anti-theft alarm 
system was activated, the alarm system LED flashes for 5 minutes. 
If a terminal status changes, e.g. if the central locking is unlocked, 
while the LED is flashing then the LED stops flashing. If the alarm 
is deactivated while the alarm is active, the deactivate instruction is 
not acknowledged and the alarm signal is completed. 

Unlocking the trunk 

The tilt alarm sensor and USIS are blanked out if the luggage com¬ 
partment is unlocked and opened on an armed vehicle. Loading 
the vehicle might result in a new vehicle resting position. 

Initialization of the USIS and the tilt sensor starts 6 seconds after 
the trunk is closed again. When the trunk is closed, the visual 
confirmation signal is repeated to indicate to the driver that the 
trunk properly closed. 


No crosswise operation 

If crosswise operation is not implemented, an alarm is triggered 
when the anti-theft alarm system is deactivated. 

This only applies to activating with the ID transmitter and deactivat¬ 
ing via the driver's door lock. The footwell module detects that the 
vehicle has been unlocked via the driver's door lock and broadcasts 
that information via the K-CAN 2. 

The CAS detects that the driver's door lock has been unlocked but 
does not unlock the vehicle. The anti-theft alarm system remains 
activated and triggers the alarm when the driver's door is opened. 

This function is coded on the Car Access System. 

Alarm System Feedback 

When the alarm is activated, the system does not signal confirma¬ 
tion until all doors, the hood and the trunk have been closed. 

That confirmation may be in the form of a visual or audible signal. 

If confirmation is by a visual signal, the alarm LED or the hazard 
warning lights may flash. If the confirmation signal is audible, it is 
produced by sounding the emergency power siren. 

Feedback via DWA LED 

The DWA LED serves as an indicator showing the status of the 
DWA system. The FZD supplies the DWA LED with signals from 
the USIS. 

When blinking, the DWA LED is driven at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. 
The switch-on time is 60 milliseconds. When the DWA LED 
flashes, it is activated at a frequency of 2 Hz.

Comfort Access 

If the vehicle is locked but the trunk is open, it is possible for the ID 
transmitter to be inadvertently left in the luggage compartment. 

If the trunk lid is closed in such circumstances, it is automatically 
opened again to prevent the ID transmitter from being locked in. 

In addition to automatically opening the trunk lid, the alarm system 
emits an audible warning. The warning consists of the emergency 
power siren sounding a two-tone signal three times. 

The FRM also activates the visual signal by the hazard warning 
lights.

Windshield Wiping/Washing 


102 

F01 Workbook - Module 1 


The wiper/washer system for the F01 operates much the same as 
previous models. The functions of the windshield wiping includes 
the following functions: 

• Intermittent wipe in stages 

• Automatic wipe using the rain/light/solar/condensation sensor 

• Continuous wipe, stage 1 

• Continuous wipe, stage 2 

• Flick wipe. 

The following systems are also included: 

• Headlight washer system SA 502 

• Water jet heater 

The wiper motor for the wiper/washer system is connected via a 
LIN bus. 

Automatic Wipe 

The automatic wipe function is activated by pressing the axial but¬ 
ton at status "terminal R ON". The LED on the wiper switch indi¬ 
cates that the function is active. A single wipe cycle is additionally 
started. 

The rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor initiates wipe requests 
according to the heaviness of the rain. The junction box control unit 
requests the status of the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor via 
the LIN bus. The junction box electronics monitor the function of 
the wiper motor via the LIN bus.

Components 

The following components are involved in the 
wiper/washer system: 

• Control units 

- Steering column switch cluster 

- Central gateway module 

- Junction box electronics 

- Instrument cluster 

- Dynamic stability control 

• Rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor 

• Wiper switch on the steering column stalk 

• Relay for headlight washer system 

• Wiper motor 

• Pump for the front washer fluid 

• Pump for headlight washer system 

• Heated washer jets. 

Steering column switch cluster 

The steering column switch cluster evaluates the status of the 
wiper switch on the steering column stalk. The respective status 
is issued by the steering column switch cluster on the FlexRay. 

Junction box electronics 

The junction box electronics is the central control unit for all wipe 
and wash functions. The junction box electronics communicate 
the current wipe reguirement via the LIN bus. 

This reguest is received by the electronics in the wiper motor and 
the relevant wiper stage is initiated. 

A separate relay is fitted in the front distribution box for the head¬ 
light washer system. 


F01 


Dynamic stability control 

The Dynamic Stability Control provides the road speed signal. 

Rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor 

The rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor is the same as the 
rain/driving lights/solar sensor, but has been enhanced with the 
condensation sensor function. 

The functionality of the rain sensor, the driving lights sensor and 
the solar sensor have been retained in full. 

The driving lights sensor supplies the on and off signal for the 
automatic driving lights control function. 

The solar sensor makes sure the automatic climate control system 
provides optimum air conditioning distribution in the vehicle. 

The condensation sensor allows the integrated automatic heat¬ 
ing/air-conditioning system to detect when condensation is forming 
on the windscreen in good time, even before the driver is aware of it.

Outside RearView Mirrors 

For the F01/F02, there is one version for the outside mirrors. 

The outside mirrors feature a LIN bus connection with the follow¬ 
ing additional functions: 

• Outside mirror fold-in 

• Electrochromic outside mirrors 

• Memory function of outside mirror settings 

• In combination with the Lane Change Warning, the outside 
mirror also contains the LED for the Lane Change Warning 
display. 


Instrument cluster (1) records the outside temperature and makes 
this information available to the vehicle electrical system. 

In the F01, the footwell module (2) receives the outside tempera¬ 
ture from the instrument cluster. The outside mirrors are connected 
via the LIN-bus. The footwell therefore reguests the mirror heating 
function via the LIN-bus.

makes it available via the PT-CAN. 


The footwell module (18) evaluates the K-CAN2 signal and initiates 
activation of the outside mirror heating (5 and 17). 

The mirror adjustment motors (9 and 13) are driven by the elec¬ 
tronic mirror module. The electronic mirror module receives the 
reguest to adjust the outside mirrors via the LIN-bus. 

The outside mirrors are connected via the LIN-bus. All information 
such as the memory position or mirror functions, e.g. dip outside 
mirrors, is transferred via the LIN-bus.

Steering Column Switch Cluster 

The steering column switch cluster is a "mechanical and electrical 
interface" from the steering wheel to the vehicle and is connected 
rigidly and mechanically to the steering column. 

On top of this purely mechanical connection, the steering column 
switch cluster is connected electrically via bus systems or directly 
to components. 

The steering column switch cluster has a steering column stalk on 
each side. The right hand steering column stalk is for activating/ 
deactivating the wiper/washer-system functions. 


The left-hand steering column stalk is for activating/deactivating the 
exterior lights (high beam/low beam) and for operating the on-board 
computer functions.

Steering Wheel 

The steering column switch cluster receives the button signals 
from the steering wheel either directly or on the LIN bus. 

These signals are forwarded by the steering column switch cluster. 

The steering wheel contains a button block for the Dynamic Cruise 
Control DCC and Active Cruise Control ACC Stop & Go functions. 

This button block is located on the left-hand side of the steering 
wheel. The steering column switch cluster broadcasts signals 
such as those from the radio volume control buttons on the 
PT-CAN. 

The steering column switch cluster receives signals on the FlexRay, 
e.g. the signal for controlling the vibration actuator.

Exterior Lighting System with Adaptive Headlights 

The adaptive headlight AHL (with bi-xenon lights) is standard on 
the F01/F02. The adaptive headlights include the functions of the 
exterior lighting system. Flowever it allows panning of the bi-xenon 
low-beam and high-beam headlights when cornering while driving. 

Panning of the bi-xenon low-beam and high beam headlights is 
adapted continuously during cornering. Illumination during corner¬ 
ing therefore improves the driver's vision. 

Illumination during cornering results in: 

• Safer cornering with faster identification of obstacles 

• Better perception of the environment 

• Prevention of accidents. 

The electronics of the adaptive headlight allow fast reaction to the 
current driving conditions. The system is controlled by the elec¬ 
tronics and is less susceptible to malfunctions than purely mechan¬ 
ical systems. 

Overview 

The functions of the exterior lighting are integrated in the footwell 
module. These lighting functions are: 

• Side lights (parking lights) 

• Low beam headlight 

• Fligh-beam headlight 

- Headlight flasher 

• Fog light 

• Direction indicator light 

- Hazard warning light 

• Tail light/license plate light 

• Brake force display 


• Reversing light 

• Parking lights 

• Welcome light 

• Delayed switch-off home lights 

• Daytime driving light. 

The headlight lighting functions are powered via a headlight driver 
module or the footwell module. 

The footwell module controls a constant brightness level for each 
headlight. This is achieved with a pulse-width regulated voltage 
supply. Voltage fluctuations in the vehicle electrical and bus sys¬ 
tems are compensated for by the pulse width. 

The LEDs, e.g. in the additional brake light, tail light or bi-xenon 
headlight are not controlled but rather activated at 100%pulse 
width. 

In addition to the standard light functions, further functions for the 
exterior lighting are integrated in the footwell module: 

• Dynamic beam throw adjustment system 

• Lamp monitoring 

- Cold monitoring with lights "OFF" 

- Hot monitoring with lights "ON" 

• Visual alarm/feedback 

- Central locking system, Antitheft alarm system, 

Crash signal 

• Special case at "Terminal 15 OFF" 

• Emergency operating mode 

• Adaptive headlight with 

-Turning lights 

-Adaptive headlight-range adjustment system.

Adaptive Headlight-range Adjustment 

The adaptive headlight-range adjustment function is used when 
the vehicle is driven through dips and over crests. Through dips, 
the headlight range is increased without dazzling oncoming vehi¬ 
cles. 

Over crests, the throw of the headlight beam is lowered slightly. 

An oncoming vehicle is not dazzled as much it would have been by 
standard headlights.

Seats 

As far as the seating is concerned, the standard front seats on the 
F01/F02 are the Multifunction seat (comfort seat). 

There is an optional luxury seating package which consists of the 
Active seat option in addition to the ventilated seats. 

The seats can be adjusted from KL 30B ON. The seat-adjustment 
switch simply has to be pressed in the desired direction. The seats 
can have up to eight adjustable positions. 

A new feature is the passenger-assist function. This is a new func¬ 
tion which enables the driver to adjust the front-passenger seat. 
The passenger assist function is also referred to as the “Gentleman 
Function”. 


The passenger-assist function is available for the memory seat and 
the multifunction seat. 

The seat module sends the request via the K-CAN to the function 
indicator for the activated passenger-assist function button in order 
to switch on the LED in the button. 



Passenger-assist Function 

The passenger-assist function is available from terminal 30B ON. 
The seat module on the driver's side alone is responsible for the 
passenger-assist Function. 

The button status is read in by the footwell module via the LIN bus 
and sent via the K-CAN2. The central gateway module transfers 
the signal to the relevant bus system. 

As soon as the driver's seat module SMFA detects an operation 
request from the passenger-assist function button, it prepares the 
front-passenger seat module for an adjustment request via the 
K-CAN. 

When the seat adjustment switch on the driver's side is now acti¬ 
vated, the seat module on the passenger's side executes the 
request. 

The K-CAN is used for communication between the seat modules. 
This allows all seat adjustment functions for the front-passenger 
seat and the memory function to be operated from the driver's 
seat.

Massage function in Rear-compartment Comfort Seat 

The F01/F02 is the first BMW vehicle to have the rear-compart¬ 
ment massage option. 

An electropneumatic system is used to implement the massage 
function. The massage function can be activated from terminal 
30B ON. The seat module is integrated into the backrest of the 
seat concerned and is responsible for the massage function.

In the backrest of the comfort seat, there is a massage pad for the 
massage function. Pressing the button starts the massage func¬ 
tion at the maximum massage intensity. 

Pressing the button again switches it to a lower massage intensity 
level. Pressing the button once again switches the massage 
function off. 

If the button is pressed for longer than 1.2 seconds during the 
massage function, the massage function will be switched off. 

In order to indicate that the massage function has been activated, 
the seat module sends the request to switch on the LEDs in the 
button. 

The signal terminal 58g ON is made available through the footwell 
module. The junction box electronics pass on terminal 58g ON to 
the button. The button then switches the back lighting on.

The buttons for the massage function are connected via the LIN 
bus to the junction box electronics. 

The junction box electronics evaluate the status of the massage 
button and send the status via the K-CAN2. 

The central gateway module transfers the signal to the K-CAN. 
This allows the seat module to receive the current status of the 
buttons. The seat module evaluates the status, activates the 
massage function, and monitors it. 














Massage 

The massage function is divided into massage cycles. A massage 
cycle consists of the massage and includes back mobilization and 
lasts approximately 64 seconds. After this, a new massage cycle 
begins. 

There are twelve massage cushions that help to relieve tension in 
the back muscles through a wave-like motion along the backrest 
from top to bottom. 

The wave-type motion is created by inflating and deflating the 
massage cushions. The pressure distribution module activates 
the massage cushions in pairs simultaneously.

Mobilization 

The massage is followed by a mobilization therapy for the back. 
The mobilization cushions are simultaneously inflated and deflated 
periodically and sectionally. For example, the mobilization cushions 
in the right shoulder and right lumbar as well as the mobilization 
cushions in the left thorax are pumped up and deflated. Following 
that, the opposite side is inflated and deflated.

Active Seat Ventilation for the Rear Comfort Seat 

In the F01/F02, a new concept has been introduced for the active 
seat ventilation. This concept requires only two fans for each seat. 


The active seat ventilation relies on the 4-zone automatic air condi¬ 
tioning. The buttons for the active seat ventilation are in the control 
panel of the automatic rear-compartment air conditioning. 


The integrated automatic heating and air conditioning system 
provides the vehicle with climate-controlled air. This means there is 
sufficient fresh and climate-controlled air in the footwell in front of 
the rear seats. The fans draw some air from the footwell. The 
drawn-in air is routed via each air-conditioning pad to the seat and 
the backrest. 



The air intensity of the active seat ventilation is coupled to the fan 
setting of the automatic rear-compartment air conditioning. 

This makes it possible to harmonize the fan noises in the rear com¬ 
partment. The active seat ventilation therefore reaches its 
maximum value, when the automatic rear-compartment air condi¬ 
tioning is set to the maximum fan setting.

If the automatic rear-compartment air conditioning is not switched 
on, then the fans are activated based on a characteristic map that is 
stored in each seat module.

The seat module in the seat concerned has sole responsibility for 
the active seat ventilation function. Stage 3 is engaged when the 
button is pressed for the first time. This sets a high fan stage for 
seat and backrest. 

The next fan setting or OFF is selected on further pressing of the 
button. 
























Air-conditioning Pad 

The air-conditioning pad has openings in the area of the seat and 
backrest surfaces. Air can be drawn in through the openings in 
order to control the temperature of the seat cover. 

Special covers are reguired for active seat ventilation. The covers 
have very small air outlets. The air drawn in by the fans can flow 
through the air outlets. This cools the seat cover and ensures that 
the temperature of the seat cover remains pleasant.
