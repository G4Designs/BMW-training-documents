Car Information Computer 


The Car Information Computer (CIC) replaces the previous CCC 
(Car Communication Computer). (CIC) was introduced to the US 
market on the 1 Series and the 3 Series in 2008. The system is 
now installed in the 7 Series (F01/F02) with many new features 
and functions, like the Owner’s Manual intergerated in the CIC. 



The screen size in the F01/F02 CIC has increased to 10.2" 
(diagonal). The number of pixels have doubled from 640x240 
(CCC) to 1280x480. This provides improved visual quality by 
generating a sharper display. 


The main noticeable feature of this 
Drive system is the newly designed 
controller that is now equipped with 
seven direct access buttons. 

These buttons provide shortcuts to 
the menus in the redesigned layout of 
the user interface. 



It is now possible to access the following menus directly: 

• Main menu 

• CD/Multimedia 

• Radio 

• Navigation 

• Telephone 

The "Back" button can be pressed to go back up to 30 steps. 
The “Option” button makes it possible to make fine adjustments 
or carry out special functions in the last selected submenu. 


The CIC combines the following control units in one enclosure: 

• Navigation computer, HIP module and yaw rate sensor 

• AM Tuner 

• FM Tuner 

• FM-RTTI Tuner 

• IBOC decoder 

• Audio system controller with music search database 

• MOST-CAN gateway 

• Interface to control display (LVDS) 

The CD-DVD player is incorporated into the CIC. It is now 
able to play video DVDs on the front CID when the vehicle is 
stationary and in the “Park” position. When the vehicle is in gear 
and/or moving only the audio track of the video will be played.

Navigation 


The navigation system is implemented in the CIC head unit by 
incorporating a hard disk, a GPS receiver module and the yaw-rate 
sensor into one device. 


Of the total 80GB of space 65GB are reserved for the navigation 
data on the hard disk. (The size of the hard disk and partitions are 
subject to change) 


Maps are displayed much faster due to the map data being stored 
in the hard disk and the increased processing power of the CIC.

View of the Navigation System’s “Speller” for Entering Destinations 


The CIC speller entry interface simplifies the destination entry pro¬ 
cedure. 

The menu located at the top right, next to the speller, shows the 
last three place names entered. 

After entering several letters, a preview map will be shown in the 
assistant window to facilitate the destination entry. 

Navigation destinations can also be entered based on their ZIP 
code using the speller symbol 1@+. 

Compared to the CCC, entering the destination using the voice 
recognition system has been made considerably easier. Many new 
commands are now possible using the voice recognition system. 






























































































The navigation system has been enhanced with the following 
functions: 

• Full-screen map display 

• Interactive map 

• Night view 

• Trip/route planner and guide tours. 

• Lane recommendation 

• 3D models in the perspective map view 

Interactive Map 



Interactive Map View 

The interactive map is another option for entering destinations. 

In addition to horizontal and vertical navigation there is also the 
option of diagonal navigation within the map screen view. 

The auxiliary line for entering the destination can now be moved 
diagonally by pushing, pressing and turning the controller. 

A destination location appears in the crosshairs, it is shown high¬ 
lighted and now it can be selected as the destination. 


Because the controller can be moved in all directions, interactive 
map is an excellent tool for checking if there are any defects in the 
controller or CIC head unit operation. 

The navigation-system outputs can also be displayed on the 
instrument panel display or in the Head-up Display. 


Night View 



Night Map View 

A night view for map presentation can be activated under Settings 
- Map Options. 

This view uses colors that are easy on the eye in darker conditions. 
In this mode streets and roads are highlighted and the surround¬ 
ings shown darker. The night view can set to automatic mode 
through the settings menu. 


Note: If traffic information is selected the night mode 
is no longer displayed.

Trip Planner 

Up to 30 stages can be entered when selecting a destination with 
the route planner. The trip or route planner is located in the 
“Options” menu of the navigation system. The entry "Trip with 
several stages" must be selected to activate this function. 



Trip/route Planner Screen 


Flags mark each stage destination in the map view. Routes put 
together by the user can be renamed and saved in the "Options" 
menu. The planner does not propose alternatives for routes put 
together by the user.

Intersection View 


Module 3 


When guidance is active, an extended intersection view can be 
viewed in the assistant window when the car approaches an inter¬ 
section. This function can be particularly helpful on multi-lane arter¬ 
ies with closely spaced exits, helping the driver deal easily with the 
problems of lane changes in heavy traffic. 

The information in the assistant window is shown only for the 
duration of the turn-off procedure for each individual place of 
interest along the route. 

Perspective View 



Perspective City View 


This is a particularly good way of viewing the land marks and land¬ 
scapes. 

The buildings in major cities are displayed at a scale setting from 
25 to 100 meters. 


Landmark buildings are shown in near-photo quality to facilitate 
orientation, especially in full-screen mode. 
























Contours of the countryside are displayed as a 3D model in the 
perspective map view when traveling over open terrain.

Lane Change Recommendation 

It is also possible to view the navigation-system information in the 
instrument panel. Along with the arrow pointers with intersection 
zoom and distance to the next turn-off, a lane-change recommen¬ 
dation is also shown. 



Navigation-system display in the instrument panel 


Head-up Display 

Navigation-system information can also be shown in the Head-up 
Display (HUD). In this case, too, along with the arrow pointers with 
intersection zoom and distance to the next turn-off, a lane-change 
recommendation is shown. Long street names are shortened 
accordingly. 



Navigation-information display in the Head-up Display 


Map Updates 

The maps data can be updated in two different ways: 

• Updating via the BMW programming system 

In this case, the map data in the CIC is updated through the 
Ethernet connection in the diagnostic connector. The data is 
enabled by means of an enable code that needs to be down¬ 
loaded and entered into the BMW programming system. 

• Using a complete Map DVD set 

The DVD is loaded directly into the head unit. The enable 
code can then be entered directly into the Drive system by 
the customer or service technician using the "speller”.

CD/Multimedia 

The hard disk drive in the CIC also makes it possible to compile 
and store a personalized music collection. Music files can be 
converted (ripped) or copied for the music collection on the hard 
disk. Stored on the CIC hard disk, fast access to these music files 
is ensured at all times.

Hard disc (slide-in tray) 


An 12GB section of the total 80GB hard disk is dedicated to store 
music files. The files can be ripped from audio CDs, DVDs or USB 
sticks. 

A USB interface is provided in the glove compartment for 
import/export purposes (data copy or data backup). 

Along with the music data files, the music track database 
(Gracenote®) is also stored to be used for the music search 
function. 



Import/export USB port in the glove compartment. 


The following three options can be used to store music data 
on the hard disk: 

• Rip function 

- This function rips commercially available audio CDs 
(marked with the Compact Disc Digital Audio logo) 

• Copying data via the CD/DVD drive 

- Self-recorded CD/DVD with audio files in MP3, WMA or 
AAC (M4A) format can be read, copied and stored via the 
CD/DVD player (drive). 

• Copying data via the USB import/export port in the glove 
compartment 

- The data contained on a USB stick (music files in MP3, 
WMA or also AAC format) can be imported via the special 
USB port in the glove compartment. 

The files must be located in the first partition of the USB stick in 
order to be recognized and processed. 

USB sticks conforming to the standard USB 1.1 are supported. 
However, the standard "High-Speed" 2.0 is recommended. 
















Depending on the USB lead used, the mass storage device may 
be able to be charged through the USB interface. However, the 
power consumption of the mass storage device must not exceed 
the maximum draw of 500 mA permitted. 

USB hard drives, USB hubs and USB memory card readers with 
several slots cannot be read when connected to the USB jack in 
the glove compartment. 

It is not advisable to copy music data from audio players (MP3 play¬ 
er, iPod®) using the import/export USB connection. 

In this case, the copied folder names will be represented by cryptic 
characters instead of an album title. This makes a subseguent 
search for a music file virtually impossible. 


CAUTION!!! 


Connecting a device to a USB import/export interface for 
charging can cause damage the external device as well as 
to the connected control units if the maximum draw 
exceeds 500mA. 

Music Collection Back-up 

The customer has the option of saving his/her complete music 
collection under the "Options" submenu. This is achieved by copy¬ 
ing to a USB stick. 

For this purpose, it is necessary to ensure that the USB stick has 
sufficient storage capacity. A minimum USB storage capacity of 12 
GB is currently reguired for backing up the music data. 

The process is similar to the data saving procedure on a PC. This 
function makes it possible to import data when changing vehicles 
or when replacing a head unit. 


F01 Workbook 

13 


Data saving will only be possible if the hard disk of the CIC has 
not been damaged and the interfaces to the CIC are still fully 
operational. 

When programming the vehicle after replacing control units, the 
music data could be irretrievably lost without saving (backing up) 
the music collection. 

Instructions on how and where to backup the music collection are 
provided in the Vehicle Owner's Manual. 

Note: For copyright reasons, the service personnel are 
not permitted to perform the data backup for the 
customer. 

Music Search 

The CIC is eguipped with special software provided by Gracenote® 
for the purpose of identifying the complete albums of ripped Digital 
Audio CD. 

The information for the music search is stored in the form of a 
metafile, similar to the ID3 tags of an MP3 file. 

A 4 GB partition is allocated to music search on the hard disk of 
the CIC for the purpose of managing the music file metadata. 

The music search performs a special filtering process that reads 
and interprets the metadata available for the individual music 
file to identify it. 

Note: CDs are identified based on the number of tracks and 
the track length. This generally only functions with 
original digital audio CDs or 1 to 1 copies created 
with special burning programs. 


Module 3

Updating the Music Track Database (Gracenote®) 

To keep the entire contents of the music search database up to 
date, BMW Service is equipped with the latest CD of the music 
track database (Gracenote®). 

The CD can be loaded directly in the CIC drive and updated via the 
Service menu of the CIC. 

The update of the music track database (Gracenote®) will apply 
only to future WMA music files conversions (rip function) of Digital 
Audio CDs.

Gracenote Update CD 

Metadata will no longer be added to files that were ripped before 
the update of the music track database (Gracenote®). 

The reason for this is that the music track database is only 
accessed when a Digital Audio CD is loaded and subsequently 
ripped. 

The Service Menu of the CIC Head Unit 

The controller can be used to activate the Service mode functions. 

The Service mode is a special facility which provides information 
about the status of the display and user control system. 

The Service mode can be used, for example, to read out hard¬ 


Module 3 


ware/software versions for the Central Information Display or control 
units in the CIC system network. 

As an addition to the comprehensive facilities of the diagnosis sys¬ 
tem, the Service mode serves as a simple means of quickly 
accessing diagnostic data without a BMW diagnosis system. 

Activating the Service Mode 

In the main menu, push the controller forwards and hold there for 
longer than 10 seconds. 

Tactile feedback will then be generated. 

Then proceed as follows: 

• Turn the controller 3 stops clockwise 

• Turn controller 3 stops anticlockwise 

• Turn controller 1 stops clockwise 

• Turn controller 1 stops anticlockwise 

• Turn controller 1 stops clockwise 

• Press the controller; the Service mode is added 
as the last menu item in the "Settings" menu. 

Note: Push the controller in any direction to return 
to the main menu. 

Four selection menus are available in the “Service menu” of the CIC: 

• Navigation 

• Telephone and BMW Service 

• TV (Not available in the US) 

• Gracenote® 




Resetting the CIC 

The Car Information Computer can be reset by pressing the rotary 
push button (ON button) for 25 seconds. 

After 25 seconds, the control display becomes blank as a confir¬ 
mation that the CIC is being restarted.

Audio System 

The Car Information Computer can be combined with the following 
speaker and amplifier systems: 

• HiFi system (12 speakers) 

• TOP-HiFi system (16 speakers) 

HiFi Amplifier 

The Audio signals are transmitted in analog form from the head 
unit to the HiFi amplifier. The internal digital equalizer adapts the 
audio signals specifically to the vehicle, as determined by the cod¬ 
ing. The iDrive does not equalize any signals. 

Top HiFi Amplifier 

The Top-HiFi amplifier is located in the rear left of the luggage 
compartment behind the side panel trim. It is cooled by it’s own 
cooling fan.

Module 3 


The audio signals and the control signals are sent in digital form to 
the Top-HiFi amplifier through the fiber-optic cable (MOST). 
Programming, coding and diagnostics are carried out via the 
MOST. 

The Top-HiFi amplifier supports Dolby Pro Logic II which 
processes sound information from the existing stereo signal. 

This process replaces Logic 7 known from other BMW vehicles. 

A surround sound effect can be computed from the stereo signal, 
which consists only of a left and right channel. 

The signals of the individual channels are output with time 
correction from the 16 available speakers of the Top-HiFi system in 
the F01/F02. This produces a homogeneous sound effect for the 
listener in 7.2 format, (seven mid-range/treble channels and two 
central bass channels). 

Note: For detailed information refer to the F01/F02 Audio 
System training material available on TIS and ICP. 

As with the 3 Series CIC, the audio system uses a triple tuner 
which combines an AM/FM double tuner with a third FM-RTTI 
tuner module. 

One tuner plays the current station as the second searches, main¬ 
tains and updates the station lists. The third module in the tuner 
network is used for the FM-RTTI (Real time traffic information) 
functions. The RTTI messages are used by the navigation system 
for displaying traffic information. 

The incorporation of an interference suppression filter enhances 
long distance AM range reception. 

Devices such as IBOC and GPS are integrated into the CIC unit, 
this adds flexibility and expands the system’s functions. 













The audio system is comprised by the following components: 

• Head unit, Car Information Computer CIC 

• Amplifiers and speakers 

• Antennas 

• Digital tuners 

• Peripherals 

- DVD changer 

- USB/audio interface 

- Smartphone integration option 

The IHKA control unit is integrated into the IHKA/audio control 
panel. 

The following applications of the CIC are stored on the integrated 
hard disk: 

• Music collection 

• Music track database (Gracenote®) 

• Navigation software (application) 

• Navigation map material 

• iSpeech (voice recognition system) 

• Contacts (database with address book data) 

Favorite Buttons 

The eight programmable favorite buttons can now also be 
assigned a submenu such as "CD/Multimedia", "Music collection" 
or "External devices" 

The buttons have two operating modes: 

• Short press : Activation of button assignments 

• Long press: Storage of function currently shown in the CID 


The long press function stores: 

• The required audio media: Radio stations, CD, DVD player or 
DVD changer access 

• Navigation destinations: However, they must already be stored 
under “Contacts” or entered from “Last destinations” 

• Phone numbers

Smartphone Integration 


It is now possible to connect to and play back (through the iDrive 
system) music tracks stored in a mobile phone. Currently, only the 
iPhone may be integrated in the vehicle network by means of the 
Smartphone Integration audio link. 

Smartphones may be connected through the USB Y cable or 
through the installation of a Smartphone integration snap in cradle 
adapter, available as option 6NF. 



Location of USB hub at left-hand B-pillar 


The audio files can be selected and played from the submenu 
"External devices" in the "CD/Multimedia" iDrive menu. 

This feature works independently from the iPod/USB interface. 

The new AUX-ln connection features an internal switch function 
to accommodate both the USB interface and the Smartphone 
integration options. 

It is possible to select audio from the snap in cradle or, switch to 
an external audio device connected to the (AUX) audio jack or 
Y-cable to the ULF-SBX-High. The switch between devices is 
triggered by inserting a plug in the (AUX) jack.

following tasks: 

• USB connection for USB/audio interface 

• Bluetooth interface with hands-free mode and phone book 

• Basic voice input and activation system through the tele¬ 
phone. 

Although both the ULF-SBX-H and the TCU may be fitted in a 
vehicle at the same time, the TCU always provides the telephone 
functions. In this case the telephone functions are not available in 
the ULF-SBX High and the module is only installed to provide the 
"USB audio interface" option. 

ULF-SBX High interface box connections 




The interface box decodes the digital audio signals collected 
through the USB interface. The audio files are then broadcast 
via the MOST. 

The analog LF signals from the audio socket are also broadcast 
on the MOST. 

The audio signal is transmitted digitally on the MOST bus to the 
HiFi amplifier and the amplifier distributes this signal to all the 
vehicle’s speakers.

The TCU used in the F01/F02 is similar to the TCU used in the 
E70. The TCU always incorporates the GPS receiver and the GPS 
connection. 

Bluetooth Antenna 

Communication between mobile phone and TCU, is through the 
Bluetooth antenna. The F01/F02 Bluetooth antenna was newly 
designed. It is smaller than the previous model and is located on 
the left B pillar near the roof. 

Note: For more information, see the F01 “Telephone 
System” training reference material available 
on ICP orTIS. 

Microphones 

There are two microphones installed in the F01/F02 in order to 
ensure that voice quality. One microphone is for the driver, the 
other is for the front passenger. 

Emergency-call GSM Antenna 

The emergency-call GSM antenna is needed for the BMW ASSIST 
services as a back up.

Bluetooth Pairing (pairing wizard) 

The pairing wizard for Bluetooth is found by selecting the 
"Telephone" menu and then selecting "Bluetooth". 

The pairing wizard presents the step-by-step instructions for the 
entire pairing process via the Central Information Display (CID). 

Up to four mobile phones can be paired with the car. Before a fifth 
mobile phone can be paired, one of the other four entries must be 
removed from the list. 

Multiple Calls 

This function can be used to conduct two phone conversations at 
the same time. Depending on the phone used, services such as 
call waiting, toggle calls and teleconferencing are now possible in 
the F01/F02. 

Call Waiting 

A second call is incoming while a call is in progress. This is indicat¬ 
ed by a call waiting tone and also by an accept/reject dialog in the 
display. The user can now reject the second call and continue the 
active call or accept the second call. In the latter case the first call is 
placed on hold and the held caller hears a call waiting melody. 

Toggle Calls 

The "toggle calls" function can be used to toggle these calls 
between the "active" status and the "on hold" status. 

Teleconferencing 

If the user has an active call and a call on hold, the "Conference" 
menu item can be selected to place all phone users in a shared 
conference call. 

Note: Not all system compatible phones are capable of 
these features. For more information see the list 
of compatible phones atwww.wireless4bmw.com 


Voice Activation 

The voice activation system has been further developed to now 
enable even simpler and more fluid voice command inputs. 

In the F01/F02 it is now possible to use spoken commands to 
administrate the contacts, phone book and address list. This 
means that three lists with up to 3000 entries can be operated by 
voice control. 

Voice-assisted destination entry for navigation has been extended 
to include entry of intersections and zip codes. 

With the new system the voice-input dialog remains open even if 
the controller is moved, so the user can immediately resume voice 
input to continue interacting with the system. This makes it much 
easier, for example, to enter a destination for the navigation system 
by selecting a street name from a list. 

There is no beep between the individual steps in a dialog 
sequence. 

There are now only two audio signals: 

• One signal confirms the start of a dialog sequence and 
sounds immediately after the user presses the PTT 
(push-to-talk) button on the steering wheel. 

• A second signal sounds to mark the end of the dialog. 

The user also receives visual confirmation via the instrument 
panel of the voice command result (e.g. after saying the command 
"New number" a confirmation will appear on the instrument panel 
display). 

0.5 GB of storage space is reserved on the hard disk for the voice 
recognition system (iSpeech data).

Rear Entertainment (RSE) 


The rear seat entertainment system F01/F02 features several 
innovations in terms of equipment and operation. 

Two folding 800 x 480 pixel displays with an infrared transmitter 
are fitted for the first time in a BMW vehicle. They are integrated 
into the backrests of the front seats. 


New features of the rear seat entertainment system: 

• Rear seat entertainment control unit with DVD player 

• Separate AV inputs and headphone connections in the rear 
center console 

• Two 8" rear displays with control units and infrared 
transmitters built into the backrests of the front seats 

• The same program can be viewed on both screens. If an 
external device (e.g. game console) is connected, the feed 
from the external device is shown on the selected side. 

• The system is controlled by remote control 


The RSE control units are integrated in the MOST bus. 

The Car Information Computer CIC serves as the master control 
unit of the MOST-bus. 

The rear displays with control units are connected to the K-CAN.

Video switch (VSW) 


The CIC and the RSE control units receive a FBAS (CVBS) com¬ 
posite video signal input from the DVD changer. The video switch 
is installed to accommodate this eguipment configuration. 

The rear displays (FD and FD2) each have their own control unit 
(SG-FD and SG-FD2). These control units are connected to the 
K-CAN. 

The rear displays are connected via LVDS to the RSE control 
unit and all video information is transmitted through the LVDS link. 

The rear displays are switched on and off by the RSE control unit 
via MOST > ZGM > KCAN. 

The ZGM places the MOST signal on the K-CAN and is sent to 
the rear displays. 

During audio playback through the vehicle's speaker system, the 
RSE control unit routes the audio signal via the MOST to the head 
unit CIC or the Top-HiFi amplifier. 

Note: Programming, coding and diagnosis of the rear seat 
entertainment system is done through the MOST. 


Module 3

F01 Workbook 


When playing a DVD in the CIC, the picture cannot be transmitted 
to the rear seat entertainment system. When playing a DVD in the 
RSE control unit the picture is not transmitted to the CIC. 

Audio playback, however, is possible in both cases. 

During playback through the DVD changer, picture and sound are 
transmitted to the CIC and the rear seat entertainment system. 

External devices can be connected through the two AV inputs 
directly to the RSE control unit, through the AUX-ln connection 
or the USB-audio interface in the center console. 

When an external device (e.g. game console) is connected through 
the AV inputs, the video signal is output on the left or right display 
depending on to where it is connected. Both screens can be set 
up to display the external source or the side not connected to the 
external device may be set up to play a different choice of media 
(DVD, radio, music collection). 

Note: Once an external device (e.g. game console) is con¬ 
nected to one of the AV inputs it remains active until 
it is powered down or disconnected. 

Headphones 

If audio is played back through the headphones, the volume can be 
adjusted either on the headphones (infrared headphones) or using 
the remote control (hard-wired headphones). 

The RSE control unit sends the audio signal to the rear displays. 
The infrared headphones receive their signals from the infrared 
transmitter. The infrared headphone frequencies are listed on 
the following chart.

RSE Remote Control 

The sound settings can be configured on the CIC or with the 
remote control. 

The remote control signal path is the same as that for the remote 
control services. The remote control operates on a frequency of 
315 MHz and must be taught in (programmed) to the specific 
vehicle to operate.

needle instruments based on full-surface Black Panel technology. 

With this display technology, the symbols of the individual functions 
only become visible when the ignition is switched on. 

At first glance, the instrument cluster appears as a black surface, 
without an arrangement of digits and different-colored function 
symbols. 

The two large dials show the road speed and engine speed. 

The two small dials indicate the fuel level on the left-hand side 
and the oil temperature on the right-hand side. 


Most of the indicator lamps arranged are in the center, at the top 
between the two large dials and above the two small dials. 

A permanent background image in orange gives the instrument 
cluster a certain 3D representation. 

The TFT display is located in the lower part of the instrument 
cluster, in the center between the two small dials. 

The display for the Entertainment mode is located on the right- 
hand side of the display; the Navigation display is in the center; 
and the display for Check Control messages is on the left.

Central Information Display CID 

The Central Information Display, CID, is a further development of 
the CID already used in BMW models. 

The new BMW 7 Series F01/F02 features very similar software as 
used in the CID installed in the BMW 3 Series with a CIC. 

As on all new BMW models, the system is operated by means of 
the central control element, the controller.

• Vehicle Info (Owner's Manual) 


Personal Profile 

The "Personal Profile" systems allows the driver to set several func¬ 
tions in the BMW 7 Series F01/F02 to suit his/her personal require¬ 
ments. 

Personal Profile stores the data entered by the driver such as auto¬ 
matic setting of the outside mirrors or speed-dependent volume in 
the corresponding control units. 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked using the identification transmit¬ 
ter, the system recognizes the corresponding settings belonging to 
the identification transmitter. 


Settings Up to three different basic settings can be adapted for three differ¬ 

ent persons. The precondition is that each of the three persons has 
his/her own identification transmitter.

System Overview 


System circuit diagram for outside temperature 


The system circuit diagram for the outside temperature is displayed 
to the right. 

The diagram is structured in such a way that only the control units 
and control elements directly involved in the instrument cluster are 
shown. 

The instrument cluster receives a large number of different bus sig¬ 
nals that provide information (speed, CC messages, etc.) for the 
various displays and indicators. These bus signals are requests to 
the instrument cluster and are therefore not listed in this product 
information. 





The only directly connected component that can be seen in the 
system circuit diagram is the outdoor temperature sensor. 

This input signal is read directly in the instrument cluster and made 
available from here to all other bus users. The outdoor temperature 
sensor wiring “passes through” the junction box and is processed 
directly by the instrument cluster.

Principles of Operation 

Instrument Cluster 

The instrument cluster receives information on the wiring harness 
in the form of analog and digital electrical signals. These signals 
are processed and displayed in the instrument cluster or passed 
on as information to other control units. 

On the new BMW 7 Series F01/F02, the instrument cluster has 
a number of functions that are new to BMW or have changed in 
relation to existing BMW models. 

Black Panel Technology 

The F01/F02 is the first BMW vehicle to utilize Black Panel 
technology. This is a panel, the back of which is coated with 
black film that virtually covers the entire surface portion of the 
instrument cluster. 

Black Panel technology is used on the instrument cluster, 
control panels for IHKA/AUDIO and FKA. 

On the instrument cluster, the area that is not covered by the 
Black Panel is designed in such a way that the symbols of the 
lamps are not visible when switched off. 

The Black Panel surface appears homogeneously dark, which 
means that no details from the background area can be detected. 

The two large accentuating rings for the speedometer and 
tachometer and two small dial areas for the fuel gauge and oil 
temperature are galvanized. 


Instrument Cluster - Off 

When the instrument cluster is switched off, the analog indicators 
are at their zero point, the active area of the display is switched off 
and the rings in the display area are not closed. 



Instrument Cluster - Vehicle Awake 

When the vehicle is awake, the analog indicators are at their zero 
point, the active area of the display is switched on only to com¬ 
plete the lower portion of the rings in the display area.

■ TFT Display 

A horizontal TFT display with a resolution of 960 x 160 pixels is 
integrated in the instrument cluster underneath the dials. 

The large mechanical, analog dials are open at the bottom. These 
dials are closed by graphics. The graphics are displayed digitally 
and contain specific functional indicators such as the range or 
current consumption. 

The display enables the prioritization of information with the follow¬ 
ing representations: 

• under right dial - display of audio and telephone lists that can 
be operated via the multifunction display, MFL 

• under left dial - display of longer, two-line Check Control texts 

• center display area - the navigation information, including 
other navigation texts under the left-hand and right-hand dial. 

This structure of the instrument cluster enables flexible use of the 
display area and keeps the signature BMW appearance for the 
large dials for road speed and engine speed. 

The most important information that appears depending on the 
content and prioritization is: 

• Navigation display 

• Infotainment (audio and telephone) 

• Voice input acknowledgement 

• Check Control messages 

• Traffic information 

• Operation acknowledgements from driver assistance systems. 

The background image is activated in orange and is always dis¬ 
played as soon as anything appears in the display.

Component Replacement 

There are three possible combinations for replacing the instrument 
clusters and Car Access System 4, CAS 4. 

• Instrument cluster defective, CAS 4 OK 

• CAS 4 defective, instrument cluster OK 

• CAS 4 and instrument cluster must be replaced. 

Simultaneous replacement of CAS 4 and the instrument cluster 
should be avoided. The odometer reading will be lost as a result. 

It is not recommended to “try” an instrument cluster from another 
vehicle. 

Removal of the Instrument Cluster 

The instrument cluster is held in place by two clips on the upper 
section of the bezel. The two torx screws as in previous model 
vehicles have been eliminated.

Personal Profile 


Personal Profile stores the data 
entered by the driver - such as 
automatic setting of the outside 
mirrors or radio presets in the 
corresponding control units. 

The personal vehicle settings are 
stored in the ID transmitter and 
can be called up again at any time. 

The individual settings in the vehicle are stored automatically 
when the user leaves the vehicle. As soon as the vehicle is 
unlocked using the identification transmitter, the system recog¬ 
nizes the corresponding settings belonging to that transmitter. Up 
to three different basic settings can be adapted for three different 
identification transmitter. 

On the BMW 7 Series F01/F02, the personal profile system has 
been extended to include more functions that can be adjusted to 
suit the personal requirements of the driver. 

New Features 

The “Personal Profile” system can be used to store different vehi¬ 
cle settings on the ID transmitter and call them up as required. 
These profiles can be named/identified by the customer and 
transferred across a USB interface in the glove box to an external 
USB storage device to another vehicle that is also equipped with 
“Mobile Profile”. 

In previous vehicle models, personal profile was limited to the 
transmitter currently binge used. As of deployment of the new 
BMW 7 Series F01/F02, the current user can select which profile 
they desire by selecting it from the profiles menu in the CID even 
if the other transmitter is not present.

Function Groups 


The customer can select personalization from the following 
function groups: 

• FM/AM tuner 

• Audio 

• Navigation 

• Favorite buttons 

• Seat, mirror, steering column 

• Camera settings (Side, Rear, NVE) 

• Light/central locking system 

• Head-up display 

• Climate 

• Language/units 

• Last mode of driver assistance systems 

• Individualization of the driving dynamics switch 

• Address book. 


Note: For safety reasons, care should be taken into 

account when changing the Profile settings from 
one user to another. During this “changeover” 
process, the steering wheel and seats may move. 
For this reason, changing profiles cannot be 
performed when the engine is running.

Condition Based Service CBS 5 


60 

F01 Workbook 


In the same way as all newer BMW models, the BMW 7 Series 
F01/F02 provides condition-oriented and requirement-oriented 
service, Condition Based Service (CBS 5). 

The CBS system indicates the wear-related maintenance work 
to the customer in a clearly arranged and plannable form. 

The CBS function shows the next due service in the instrument 
cluster. In the CID, on the other hand, all the external and internal 
variables are provided in an additional list. 

The CBS sorts all the services/tasks according to the due dates. 
The customer can determine the appointments and due dates 
of service in that a car symbol appears in a colored frame and 
the remaining distance or remaining time to the next service is 
displayed. 

The instrument cluster has a central gateway function in the CBS 
system. This implements, for example, the sorting of all services or 
tasks in the instrument cluster. 

The instrument cluster calculates the following services or tasks: 

• Vehicle inspection 

• Vehicle check 

• Brake fluid 

• Run-in inspection. 

The services or tasks for engine oil and front/rear brake pads are 
calculated by external control units and only forwarded for display 
on the instrument cluster. 


Module 3 


CBS Indicators in the Instrument Cluster 

The CBS display always consists of the following two separate 
indicators: 

• A car symbol in the Center of the TFT display 

• A specified remaining distance and/ora specified absolute 
time immediately below the car symbol. 

In the display, a distinction is made between the following two 
CBS states: 

• Service due yellow-framed car symbol. 

• Service due since red-framed car symbol.

Service Information 

Resetting the Service Tasks 

If one or more service tasks have been carried out, for example 
“Replace front brake pads”, these services/tasks must be reset to 
their full service interval. 

There are two possibilities to resetting the service tasks in the car: 

1. Legal service tasks such as a vehicle safety or emissions 
inspection can only be reset in the “Vehicle status” menu. 

2. All maintenance-related service tasks such as replacing 
engine oil, are reset using the reset button for the 
trip/distance recorder in the instrument cluster. 

Note: A connection to the BMW diagnosis system is 
required for the CBS task “Predelivery check”. 

The Reset menu is called up as follows: 

• Press the reset button for longer than five seconds; the Reset 
menu is displayed. The CBS symbol, for example “Pre-delivery 
check”, is displayed in the TFT display between the two dials. 

• Briefly press the Reset button to browse in the Reset menu. 

• To activate the selected service task, press the Reset button 
for a longer period; the wording changes to “Run Reset” and 
a progress bar starts. 

• Reset is completed as soon as the lettering “Reset success¬ 
ful” appears. 

Note: If availability has not yet fallen below 90%, no reset 
can be carried out. A reset block is shown in the TFT 
display: “Reset not possible”. 


- Module 3 


Important Information on Resetting the Service Tasks 

On CBS 5 or higher, the CBS function “Vehicle check” is linked to 
the date of the engine oil interval. The aim of this link is to ensure 
that a vehicle check is carried out with every second engine oil 
change. 

At the start of the first oil interval with the CBS function “Vehicle 
check”, the customer sees double the remaining distance and dou¬ 
ble the time interval of the CBS function “Engine oil”. After the oil 
change, both services/tasks run synchronously, i.e. “Engine oil” and 
“Vehicle check” are carried out simultaneously. 

The CBS function “Vehicle check” contains the input information 
from the CBS function “Engine oil”, which is why the service inter¬ 
val “Engine oil” must always be reset before the service interval 
“Vehicle check”. 

Note: Before resetting CBS functions, check the onboard 
date and correct it if necessary. The control units use 
the current date and a time interval stored in the con¬ 
trol unit to calculate the new target date. 




Setting Inspection Date 

The appointment for vehicle inspections can only be entered in the 
Central Information Display CID using the controller. 

As there is different legislation depending on the state, different 
intervals or complete elimination of the item in the menu can be 
achieved. 

The following operations are reguired to enter appointments: 

• Open the main menu by pressing the Menu button on the 
controller. 

• Turn the controller until “Vehicle Info” is highlighted, then 
press to activate. 

• Turn the controller until “Vehicle Status” is highlighted, then 
press to activate. 

• Turn the controller until “Service reguirements” is highlighted, 
then press to activate. 

• Turn the controller until “§ Vehicle inspection”, for example, is 
highlighted, then press to activate.

Climate Control 


The new 4-zone IHKA system is similar (in operation) to the 
system used on E70 and E71 vehicles. The F01/F02 heating and 
air conditioning system has been enhanced in terms of heat¬ 
ing/cooling capacity, airflow distribution, noise and convenience 
when compared with the previous 7 Series system. 

The (IHKA) Integrated automatic climate control system is avail¬ 
able in the following versions: 

• IHKA (4-zone) 

The (IHKA) Integrated automatic climate control with rear cli¬ 
mate control (FKA) is a 4-zone system. The climate control 
can be individually set for 4 separate zones of the passenger 
compartment according to the four control points. 


PTC heater elements in the rearfootwell ducts make it possible to 
boost the individual air outlet temperature for the rear passengers. 

The rear passengers have the facility for adjusting the air tempera¬ 
ture from the rear center air vent and separately for the left and 
right B-pillar vents by means of two stratification adjusters 
(potentiometers) on the rear center air vent. 



IHKA (4-zone) 

The IHKA (4-zone) has an additional control panel and control unit 
in the rear passenger compartment and thus also provides the 
rear passengers with the facility for fully automatic control of tem¬ 
perature, airflow rate and airflow distribution with a choice of 5 
intensity levels. 

The IHKA climate-control unit is equipped with 15 stepper 
motors. 

There is also an extra fan for the rear passenger compartment in 
the center console.

IHKA Components 

The IHKA 4-zone system is recognizable in the vehicle by the addi¬ 
tional FKA climate control panel in the rear. Above the FKA control 
panel the IHKA system has an air vent with two airflow stratification 
adjusters (left/right). 

Components of the 4-zone IHKA system 


The IHKA 4-zone climate-control unit has 15 stepper motors for 
automatic airflow control. 

In the center console there is an additional fan for supplying air to 
the rear. The rearfootwell ducts are each fitted with a PTC heater 
element.

IHKA Control Panel 

The control panels and control units of the climate control systems 
on the F01/F02 are combined units incorporating the audio sys¬ 
tems control panel. 

All equipment options on the F01/F02 provide separate tempera¬ 
ture controls for the left and right sides. The driver and front pas¬ 
senger can select separate automatic programs. 

In order to be able to cater for the different heating/air conditioning 
preferences of as wide a range of customers as possible, the auto¬ 
matic mode on the F01/F02 climate control offers a choice of 5 
different levels of intensity for the automatic program. 



Automatic mode is activated by pressing the AUTO button. 

The intensity level is selected by repeatedly pressing the "Fan 
speed" rocker button when Automatic mode is active. 

The "ALL" button can be used to synchronize the temperature, 
AUTO mode intensity or airflow rate and airflow distribution set¬ 
tings for all 4 zones with the settings for the driver. 

Some of the possible control scenarios on the control panels of the 
climate control systems are illustrated below. 

The residual heat (Rest) feature is accessed in the same way as on 
E70/E71, by pressing the “high” side of the driver’s fan button.

FKA Control Panel 

The addition of the extra control panel and control unit for the rear 
passengers realizes the 4-zone IHKA. 

The 4-zone system has four control points for individually adjusting 
the climate control settings. 

The automatic program with its 5 intensity settings can also be 
selected in the rear seats. 

The intensity level in automatic mode for the rear passengers is 
selected and set by pressing the fan rocker button.

The rear passengers can adjust the temperature separately for the 
left and right sides of the rear passenger compartment. 

Temperature sensors located on the airflow of the rear center air 
outlets monitor the air outlet temperature while stratification poten¬ 
tiometers mounted below the vents of the rear center air outlets 
are used to fine tune the individual temperature settings.

To optimize the overall climate control package and as a noise 
reduction measure, the main blower fan for the IHKA has been 
placed in the engine compartment. 

The fresh air is drawn in through the cowl between windshield 
and hood. It then passes through a coarse filter in the climate con¬ 
trol fan housing before entering the IHKA system. 

The fan draws in the recirculated air from the passenger compart¬ 
ment through an opening in the lower bulkhead.

The air flows through a flap between the fan motor and the 
climate control housing into the filter housing. 

In the filter housing, the fresh or re-circulated air is filtered by two 
combination filters (with activated charcoal) before it continues on 
to the evaporator and heater core. 

Depending on the IHKA settings and the inside and outside tem¬ 
peratures, the air is initially cooled and dried by the evaporator and, 
if necessary, then re-heated by the heater core before it is sent to 
the outlet vents.

Air Ionizer 

The air Ionizer used in the F01/F02 is the latest technical innova¬ 
tion in the area of heating and air conditioning. 

The air ionizer is positioned upstream of the evaporator and it is 
activated as necessary when the vehicle is stationary.

Module 3 


By partial ionization of the air the formation of bacteria on the 
evaporator surface and the associated odor is prevented. 

The air ionizer is a separate component which fits onto the climate- 
control unit with bayonet connection and is positioned in the air 
stream to the evaporator. 

It essentially consists of a planar module, a flat ceramic plate which 
is covered by hard glass with printed electrical conductors located 
on the front and back of the component. 

Applying a high voltage generated internally in the ionizer partially 
ionizes the air. 

The chemical reaction between the ionized air and the condensed 
water produces hydrogen peroxide in the evaporator housing, 
which kills bacteria and germs on the evaporator and thus prevents 
the formation of unpleasant odors that could enter the vehicle inte¬ 
rior. 

The IHKA decides when and whether to operate the air ionizer, 
based on the ambient and operating conditions of the climate 
control system. 

The air ionizer is operated for a period of several minutes by a 
control signal from the IHKA. 

Operation takes place as required only during the overrun period 
after Terminal 15 is turned OFF and the vehicle is locked. 

The maximum power consumption of the unit is 850 mA. 

The power supply for operating the air ionizer is through a 
three-pin connector on the climate control wiring harness. 

Communication with the IHKA control panel takes place by 
means of a control signal via a bidirectional cable connection. 















IHKA Stepper Motors 

The IHKA housing incorporates the evaporator, heater core and all 
the air flaps necessary to control the climate in the vehicle. 

The airflow needs to be filtered, temperature regulated and 
properly distributed to the air outlets. 


This is all done within the IHKA housing with the aid of a system of 
stepper motors. 

For higher performance in terms of rear air conditioning, the IHKA 
4-zone climate-control unit has 15 stepper motors for automatic 
airflow distribution.
