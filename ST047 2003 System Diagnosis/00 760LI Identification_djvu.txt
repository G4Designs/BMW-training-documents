760LI Visual Identification 



The 760LI includes features previously introduced in the E66. Minor interior and exterior trim 
changes accompany the introduction of the N73, VI2 engine. 

The 760Li is distinguished from other models in the range by a discreet VI2 logo on the 
front wheel arches, unique chrome kidney grill, new wheel design, and B pillars and exteri¬ 
or mirror stems finished in hi-gloss black. 

The interior has been made even more luxurious with the center console, doors and dash¬ 
board all trimmed in Nasca leather. The dashboard also receives inlaid burr walnut trim. 
Alcantara roof lining has been added, as well as an illuminated VI2 sill plate. However, the 
most significant difference is found under the bonnet.
