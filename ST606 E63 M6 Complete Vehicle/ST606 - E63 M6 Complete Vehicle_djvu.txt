Introduction 


With the new M6, BMW M GmbH presents the sports-oriented 6 Series luxury coupe: 

5 liter displacement, 10 cylinders, 500 hp output, 383lb-ft torque and engine speeds 
beyond the 8000 rpm boundary. 

But power is not everything. What is more significant are the acceleration characteristics 
and the vehicle dynamics, which in turn depend, on the one hand, on the vehicle weight 
and, on the other hand, on the actual thrust at the drive wheels that is derived from the 
engine torque and the overall transmission ratio.The 7-speed SMG is the ideal manual 
gearbox for optimally transferring the powerfrom the V10 engine via the drive train to the 
rear wheels. Together with the excellent, uncompromising chassis with its sports orient¬ 
ed tuning, this power plant launches the B M W M 6 into the ranks of a super sports car. 

Yet, in contrast to its normally two-seater competitors, the M6 offers the space and com¬ 
fort of atypical 2+2 seateras well as the well-appointed interior trim and equipment of a 
typical luxury class BMW.

M6 Heritage - E63 



BMW has been crafting sleek and fast coupes since 1936, but more strictly speaking the 
M6's heritage encompasses just four predecessors: the 3.0 CSL,the Ml, a first-genera¬ 
tion M6 and the 850CSi. All, to one degree or another, were products of BMW M, or 
BMW Motorsportas it was originally called. 

With the new M6, BMW M continues the proud tradition of performance coupes manu¬ 
factured by BMW.

The electronic damper control system has been adopted from the E60 M5 and the soft¬ 
ware adapted to the E63 M6. 

Traction Control Systems 

The DSC Mk60E5 has been adopted from the E60 M5 with the software configuration 
(coding data set) adapted to the E63 M 6. 

Front Axle Suspension 

The stabilizer bar on the front axle is designed as a tubular stabilizer bar and has been 
adapted to match the chassis tuning. The link, rubber mount and bracket have been 
adopted from the E60 M 5. Due to the design of the front axle, there are sections with dif¬ 
ferent outside and inside diameters. 

The spring strut corresponds to that of the E60 M5 but the spring plates have been 
adapted to the E63 M6 in terms of the kinematic requirements as well as spring tuning 
and length. 

The geometry of the cylindrical coil spring is the same as on the E39 M5.The spring 
plate and top spring mount are identical to those on the E46 M 3. 

Front Axle Mounting 

The thrust panel on the front axle is a common part with the E60 M 5 and is made from 
aluminum. 

The material thickness is 2.5 mm on the E63 645i and 3.5 mm on the E63 M 6. 

The control arms are the same as installed on the E63 645i but fitted with rubber mounts 
from the E 61. 

The heat shield panels on the left and right of the front axle carrier have been adapted to 
the S85B50 engine. 

Wheel Bearings 

Apart from the camber modification, the swivel bearing is a common part with the E63 
645i.

Brakes 

Brake Operation (hydraulic system) 

The brake lines for are the same as on the E60 M5 but specifically adapted to the E63 
M6. 

Electric Vacuum Pump 

The assistance of an external vacuum pump is required under various operating condi¬ 
tions (e.g. race track mode, driving off with the engine cold or rolling at terminal 15 with 
the engine not turned on) to ensure sufficient vacuum in the brake booster at all times. 

An electric vacuum pump has been installed with the introduction of the E63 M6. It is 
installed on the left in the engine compartment underthe left microfilter for the heating/air 
conditioning system. This vacuum pump is also installed with the series launch of the 
E60 M5. 


Electric Vacuum Pump

Explanation

Vacuum Pump 


Actuation 

The electric vacuum pump is actuated by the DME (digital motor electronics) MS_S65. 
An external pressure sensor (see illustration below) signals the pressure difference from 
the brake booster compared to the ambient pressure to the DME. 

When vacuum is required, the DME activates the relay which in turn then actuates the 
electric vacuum pump. The cut-in and cut-out thresholds are controlled as a function of 
the differential pressure and the vehicle speed. 

The software in the DME is configured such that the correct vacuum is available in the 
brake booster under all driving conditions. 

With relatively little vacuum in the brake booster, the engine must be running orthe vehi¬ 
cle must be rolling with terminal 15 on in order to activate the electric vacuum pump.

Diagnosis 

A test module is provided in DIS for the electric vacuum pump. 

The differential pressure sensor on the brake booster is used forthe purpose of monitor¬ 
ing the pump. The plausibility is checked by the pressure difference between the vacuum 
and ambient pressure calculated internally in the DME. It is evaluated and, in the case of 
fault, shown in the instrument cluster and displayed as a CC message (check control). 

If the electric vacuum pump is found to be defective during the self-diagnosis procedure, 
the safety concept manager (S K manager) intervenes and shuts down the cylinder bank 
6-10. The smaller opening cross section in the intake duct of cylinder bank 6-10 thus 
ensures adequate vacuum in the brake booster. 

In the case of fault the safety concept manager triggers an "engine" symbol as well as a 
CC message (check control) "engine malfunction/power loss" in the instrument cluster. 

Emergency Programs of the Safety Concept Manager 

The fault code "electric vacuum pump for Mastervac" (Mastervac = brake booster) is 
stored in the fault code memory in connection with the fault types "short to positive", 
"short to ground" and "line break". The following actions are initiated: 

• Maximum torque 200 Nm 

• Maximum engine speed 3500 rpm 

• Maximum vehicle speed 150 km/h 

The following actions are initiated in connection with the fault "pump not running": 

• Maximum torque 100 Nm 

• Maximum engine speed 2000 rpm 

• Maximum vehicle speed 50 km/h

Body 

Apart from the carbon roof, front and rear bumpers as well as the left and right side sill 
panels, the body corresponds to that of the basic E63 645i. 

The outside mirror is the same as on the E60 M 5. 

Changes to the body: 

• Roof 

• Front bumper 

• Rear bumper 

• Left/right sill panel 

Roof 

As already used on the E46 M3 CSL in other markets of the world, the E63 M6 features 
a visible carbon fiber reinforced plastic (C F K) outer roof skin panel. 

The carbon fibre-reinforced plastic roof is 7 kg lighterthan the standard steel roof there¬ 
fore lowers the vehicle's center of gravity. This has a particularly positive effect on the 
vehicle dynamics. 

Minor scratches can be painted. The roof must be replaced in the event of more exten¬ 
sive damage (e.g. a hole). The carbon fibre-reinforced plastic roof is bonded to the body 
(see Repair Instructions No. 41 31 000) 



Carbon Roof 

Note: The panoramic roof option SA is not available.
