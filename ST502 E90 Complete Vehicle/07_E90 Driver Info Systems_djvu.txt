Introduction 


The overall concept for the displays and control of the driver and comfort area was to 
design a more discrete and subtle appearance of the interior. Fewer switches and con¬ 
trols simplify operations in the new BMW 3 Series. 

The display, indicator and control elements are arranged in order of importance: "Most 
important at the top - less important at the bottom." 

There are four major systems that make up the displays and indicators for the E90: 

• Instrument Cluster 

• Central Information Display (CID) 

• Personal Profile. 

• Connected Service

Instrument Cluster 


The new BMW 3 Series is equipped with an instrument cluster featuring analog instru¬ 
ments for: 

• Speed 

• Engine speed 

• Economy control and 

• Fuel level. 

Two large pointer instruments show the road speed and engine speed. Two smaller 
pointer instruments display fuel level and current fuel consumption. 

All of the indicator lamps are located in the center at the top between the two large 
instrument dials. 

The liquid crystal display is located in the center between the two large pointer instru¬ 
ments. 

A classic two-dial design draws attention to both instruments. Each finished unobtru¬ 
sively with two trim rings in pearl-finish chrome. 

The instrument cluster on the BMW3 Series has no gateway function. Only the outside 
temperature, the information from the steering column switch cluster, and footwell 
module are shown directly in the display.

Speedometer / Tachometer 

On the BMW 3 Series, vehicle and engine speed is displayed using the following signal 
path: 

• The DME control unit sends the engine speed on the PT-CAN and K-CAN. 

• Using a characteristic curve, step pulses for actuating the stepper motor are 
assigned to the effective engine speed. 

The engine speed range is 7500 rpm on vehicles eguipped with the NG6 engines. 

Instantaneous Fuel Economy Gauge 

The instantaneous fuel economy gauge is an analogue indicator driven by a stepper 
motor in the instrument cluster. 

The fuel consumption is based on the injector on time signal (ti) sent from the DME 
control unit via the bus lines to the cluster. The board computer (BC) functions of the 
instrument cluster calculates for the “real time” fuel consumption. 

Fuel Gauge 

The fuel gauge indicator is an analog indicator driven by a stepper motor. The instrument 
cluster receives a signal from two sending units submerged in the left and right sides of 
the gas tank. From these two varying voltage signals, fuel level is calculated by the cluster. 

The fixed LED for low fuel warning has been eliminated. A pictogram of a fuel gauge now 
lights up in the instrument cluster when the level drops below 2.1 gallons. A warning tone 
additionally sounds on reaching the reserve threshold. 

Outside Temperature Display 

A temperature sensor(NTC type) mounted on the front bumper cover of the vehicle mea¬ 
sures the outside temperature. The analog signal is sent to the cluster to be displayed. 

In ignition key position 0, the instrument cluster applies terminal 30g current to the tem¬ 
perature sensor every 10 minutes. 

The instrument cluster makes available the current outside temperature in the form of a 
data telegram via the K-CAN. 


10 

E90 Driver Information Systems 



Indicator and Warning Lamps 

The indicator and warning lamps are activated by the processor in the instrument cluster. 


All important and legally stipulated indicator and warning lamps are activated at terminal 
15 ON during the pre-drive check. 

The indicator and warning lamps can be illuminated in different colors or combinations. 


The significance of the indicator and warning lamps as well as the colour assignments 
are described in detail later under check control messages. 



Indicators and Warning Lamps 



Liquid Crystal Display Area 


Liquid Crystal Display 

The liquid crystal display is divided into two areas. 


The time and outside temperature are shown in the upper display along with the CC 
messages and CBS images. 


The on-board computer functions, CBS messages, distance recorder as well as the 
program display for automatic transmission are shown in the lower display. 


Manipulation Dot 

Different data are stored in the instrument cluster and in the CAS when a dot appears to 
the left of the trip distance recorder. 

The manipulation dot is indicated when, for example, comparison of the stored vehicle 
identification number does not agree. 

Program and Gear Display 

The program and gear display is shown in the bottom window in the liquid crystal display 
on 

vehicles with automatic or SMG. 

The program and gear display shows letters and numbers. The program mode is 
displayed all the time and is not overwritten by other information. 

On manual transmission vehicles, the gear display is blanked out by means of the coding 
and an enlarged version of the BC display is coded in its place. 


11 

E90 Driver Information Systems 









Acoustic Generators 

Audible warnings are given in support of check control messages if the vehicle is 
equipped with a RAD2. The instrument cluster controls these warnings via the K-CAN. 
The warning signals are output by the CCC control unit when installed as an option. 

The request for the turn signal indicator is sent by the footwell module via the K-CAN. 

Backlighting 

The cluster sends a K-CAN bus signal to other modules on in the vehicle to inform them 
of backlighting intensity. 

While the vehicle lighting is OFF, a phototransister in the instrument cluster graduates the 
amount of backlighting needed to overcome ambient lighting. 

While the vehicle lighting is ON, the backlighting is determined by the adjustment of the 
KL58g circuit via the BC menu on the cluster. The lighting intensity can be set by using 
the rocker switch on the turn signal stalk on the steering column. 



BC Menu for Adjusting Backlighting 


Audible Warnings 

US vehicles additionally feature an ignition key warning and a seat belt warning. 

An uninterrupted warning tone sounds when the driver's door is opened with terminal 15 
OFF and the identification transmitter in place. 

The audible signal is switched off by removing the identification transmitter, closing the 
door or after 30 minutes. 

The seat belt warning is activated at terminal 15 ON if the seat belt contact is not closed. 

The audible warning is intermittent and is no longer than 6 seconds. The indicator and 
warning lamp remains on. 


12 

E90 Driver Information Systems 




On-Board Computer 

There are two versions of the computer available for the BMW 3 Series: 

• On-board computer as basic version 

• On-board computer as journey computer (on CCC equipped vehicles) 

The basic on-board computer contains the following functions: 

• Average fuel consumption 1 

• Range 

• Current consumption 

• Average speed 

For the journey computer, the computer is expanded to include the following additional 
functions: 

• Start of journey 

• Duration of journey 

• Distance covered 

• Arrival time 

• Average fuel consumption 2 

• Average speed 2 

• Remaining distance 

The individual functions of the basic version of the computer can be shown in succession 
in the liquid crystal display of the instrument cluster. The data description is the same as 
that for the other BMW models. 

Display Variants 

There are two display variants of the on-board computer functions in the instrument 
cluster. 



1. Computer in vehicle with automatic transmission 

2. Computer in vehicle with manual transmission

E90 Driver Information Systems 





The menu rocker switch must be pressed for at least 2 seconds in one direction to 
enable fast scrolling of all menu items. The menu is then scrolled through at intervals of 
0.5 seconds. 

Show Displays 

The BC displays are shown and scrolled in the instrument cluster via a menu rocker 
switch on the steering column stalk for the direction indicator lights. 

The individual functions are displayed in the lower display window of the instrument clus¬ 
ter. Once terminal R is switched on, the computer will display the computer function that 
was displayed last. 

All other functions can be selected by means of the rocker switch on the steering column 
stalk. The order in which the BC functions are shown is always the same. 

More information is found later in this section under principles of operation.

E90 Driver Information Systems 



Principals of Operation 

The instrument cluster receives information on the wiring harness in the form of analog 
and digital electrical signals. These signals are processed and displayed in the instrument 
cluster or passed on as information to other control units. 

The instrument cluster on the BMW 3 Series features several functions that have been 
changed compared to previous models. 

Moving Dial Indicator 

Fig. 1 shows the movement sequence of the moving dial indicator based on the rev 
counter. 

The moving dial indicator (2) is driven by: 

• ring gear (3) connected to the dial 

• pinion (6) 

• stepper motor (7) secured to the rear of pc-board (5).

Fuel Gauge 



The fuel reserve level is not indicated by an indicator lamp as in the 
previous models. A fuel pump symbol lights up for 23 seconds in the 
liquid crystal display as soon as the reserve level is reached (2.1 gal¬ 
lons). 

This display is permanently activated at a range below approx. 

31 miles. 


On-Board Computer 

A graphic symbol in the upper display window is assigned to each main menu item. 

Menu items that are deactivated during vehicle operation are not shown (ex. RDC). 

Each menu can be interrupted at a certain position by briefly pressing the BC button. 

In addition to this active termination, there is an automatic termination that takes place 15 
seconds after the last entry. 

The display for the CCC are shown on the central information display CID.

Personal Profile 

The "Personal profile" systems allows the driver to set several functions of the BMW 3 
Series to suit his/her personal requirements. 

Personal profile stores the data entered by the driver such as automatic setting of the 
outside mirrors or speed-dependent volume in the corresponding control units. 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked using the remote control, the system recognizes the 
corresponding settings belonging to the remote control. 

Up to three different basic settings can be adapted for three different persons. The 
precondition is that each of the three persons has his/her own remote control. The BMW 
3 Series caters for the driver's personal requirements. 



Note: Up to three different basic settings can be adapted for three different 
personalizations.

Display in the instrument cluster Display formats and units of measure The following 
display formats and units of measure can be changed in the instrument cluster: 

• Fuel consumption (1/100 km, mpg, km/I) 

• Distance (km, mis) 

• Time format (12h/24h) 

• Date format (dd/mm, mm/dd) 

• Temperature (°C, °F) 

• Reset of display formats and units of measure, the factory setting is adopted. 

The procedure for selecting and changing all display formats and units of measure is 
identical. By way of example, the procedure for changing the unit of measure is described 
in detail. 

Changing Unit of Measure 

The following procedure must be carried out in order to change the unit of measure: 

1. Press the rocker switch in the steering column stalk up or down until the "Personal 
Profile" function appears in the instrument cluster. 

2. Press the BC button on the steering column stalk. 

3. Press the rocker switch up or down until the required unit of measures is shown. 

4. Press the BC button on the steering column stalk. 

5. Use the rocker switch to make the necessary change. 

6. Press the BC button to adopt the change. 



Changing Unit of Measure 


Note: On a vehicle equipped with a CCC/CID, the changes in personal profile 
are made using the vehicle settings menu in the iDrive system. The menu 
will not be displayed on the cluster.

Central Information Display (CID) 


The central information display (CID) is the graphic display unit for the user interface of 
all convenience functions and several vehicle functions. Only vehicles equipped with 
navigation system (option 609) will be equipped with a CID. 

The main menu consists of four menu items: 

• Communication 

• Navigation 

• Entertainment 

• Climate control. 

All individual user settings are combined under the additional "Settings" menu. 

The button for selecting the main menu is located behind the controller in the center 
console. 

As on other BMW models, the system is operated by means of the the controller. 

The design of the central information display is identical to that of the CID installed in the 
BMW 5 Series. In the BMW 3 Series, the same software is used in the central informa¬ 
tion display as in the BMW 5 Series and 6 Series.

System Components 


Central Information Display (CID) 

The central information display CID is secured with two torx-head tapping screws in the 
central area of the instrument panel. 

The CID comprises the following two components: 

• Casing with integral electronic module 

• Casing attachment with glass cover. 

The controller which is used to control the displays and indicators in the CID will also be 
included as an indirect but integral part of the CID system. 

Liquid Crystal Display 

The E90 vehicles eguipped with a navigation system will have a CID. There is only one 
version of the CID available: 

• LCD 8.8" High in connection with CCC The display is equipped with a digital 8.8" 
TFT screen (Thin Film Transistor) with a visible area of 209.28 mm x 78.48 mm. The 
resolution of the TFT display is 400 x 3 x240 pixels.

E90 Driver Information Systems 







Controller 

The controller is the central operating control for all comfort functions and selected 
options for some vehicle functions that are displayed on the central information display. 

The controller is located in the center console immediately behind the gear selector lever, 
within reach of the user (driver and front passenger). 

There is only one variant available: 

• High variant with CCC 

The tactile feedback for the rotary movement at the controller is generated electrically in 
the High variant. The tactile feedback for the rest position, the main directions of move¬ 
ment and the depressed position is created by mechanical means. 

The principle of the controller is identical to that on the BMW 6 Series, BMW 5 Series, 
and BMW 7 Series models. 

The menu button which can be used to show the main menu in the CID is located direct¬ 
ly behind the controller. In addition to the menu button, another button is provided to acti¬ 
vate/deactivate the voice recognition system SVS. 

The button signals are read into the controller and converted into K-CAN telegrams.

Service Information 


Service Mode 

The controller can be used to activate the Service mode functions. 

Service mode is a special facility which provides information about the status of the dis¬ 
play and user control system. 

Service mode can be used, for example, to read out hardware/software statuses for the 
central information display or control units in the CCC system network. 

As an addition to the extensive diagnostics available through the diagnosis system, 
Service mode acts as a simple means of quickly accessing diagnostic data without the 
need for a diagnosis tester. 

Sources of Information 

In Service mode, information on the following functions can be selected from the upper 
menu bar: 

• C-Application 

• C-HOST 

• C-Tuner 

• C-ASK 

• C-Gateway. 

The information available at this time is software, hardware, and operating system status. 
Further development should come soon. 

Push the controller in any direction to return to the main menu. 

Activating Service Mode 

Select main menu and press and hold the controller. Tactile feedback will then be

Connected Service 


Connected Service is a maintenance concept that has been part of the BMW Group 
since the introduction of the BMW 7 Series. 

Connected Service is made up of several modules; some of these are already in opera¬ 
tion while others have been further developed or introduced for the first time with the 
launch of the BMW 3 Series. 

Connected Service is an indication of how communications and networking between 
the car and Service are increasing. TeleServicel can even make an automatic service 
call which informs the customer's home dealer that a service is due. 

The Key Reader is an important Connected Service module. Service reception is able to 
read the data stored in the vehicle key with the Key Reader.

Condition Based Service (CBS) 

In the same way as the mid-range and luxury models, the BMW3 Series will also be 
offering service intervals that are geared towards the current condition of selected 
components, i.e. servicing that depends on the condition of components and mainte¬ 
nance reguirements; this is known as Condition Based Service (CBS). 

Condition based service therefore means - servicing on a timely basis. 

The system calculates when a service operation, e.g. an oil change is due and informs 
the customer of this via the liguid crystal display in the instrument cluster. 

CBS sorts all the data according to date due and can determine when the vehicle should 
be taken into service. 

If a central information display CID is installed, the instrument cluster passes on the 
sorted data to the CID where the data can be displayed in the service menu. 

There are ten different types of service, with each of these types being assigned to a 
specific service group, e.g. oil change. 

The system comprises the following components with their sensors: 

• Instrument cluster 

• External control units such as DME, IHKA, and DSC 

• Car Access System (CAS) 2 

• Central information display CID.

Service Information 


Resetting the Service Operations 

When one or more service operations have been carried out, e.g. front brake pads have 
been changed, these operations must be reset to their full service interval. 

There are three options for resetting the service operations: 

1. Legally required service operations such as the vehicle inspection (HU) and exhaust 
emission inspection (AU) can only be reset in the "Service" menu. 

2. All vehicle servicing service functions such as changing spark plugs are reset via the 
reset button for the trip distance recorder in the instrument cluster. If the reset but¬ 
ton is pressed for longer than ten seconds, the reset mode opens automatically. 

3. All fields can be reset using the service functions found in the diagnosis program 
of the DISplus orGTI. 

To reset the service information data using the cluster: 

• KL-15 on and all Variable displays in cluster off (clock should be displayed) 

• Press and hold odometer reset button until CBS pictures display in cluster for about 
5 seconds then release 

• Use the BC button to scroll through till desired resetable picture is displayed. 

• “Reset?” is displayed, Press and hold BC button a picture of a small anaolg clock 
runs through its display. When complete, the CBS reset that you chose is reset. 

• If you want to insure that the reset was done, you can press the BC button while still 
looking at the CBS reset pictogarm and the acknowlegment of reset will be shown 
with a check mark in a box 

Entering Due Date 

The due date for the legally required general inspection and exhaust emission inspection 
can be entered only in the central information display with the aid of the controller. 

Since different laws are applicable depending on the country, country-specific intervals 
can be found at this point. For markets where no such regulation applies for general 
inspection and exhaust test, this function can be suppressed by the diagnostic software 
in the DISplus or GT1 under: service functions -handover inspection. 

Carry out the following procedure to enter the due date: 

• Select "Service" from the "Settings" menu and confirm 

• Select service operation "§ Vehicle inspection" for example and confirm. 

"Set service date" is marked. 

• Press controller to activate the input box. 

• Enter the date by turning and pressing the controller. 

• Select "Exit display" and confirm to return to the last setting.
