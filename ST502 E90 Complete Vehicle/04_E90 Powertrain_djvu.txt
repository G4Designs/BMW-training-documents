Engine 


The introduction of the new BMW 3 series (E90) to the U.S. market will again set the 
standard by which all others will be judged, including its predecessors. 

The previous M54/M56 engine is being replaced with a new engine variant referred to 
as the N52, which introduces a number of new technologies with regard to engine 
development. 

The objectives in developing the N52 include: 

• Increased power output and torque 

• Reduction of fuel consumption 

• Reduction of overall engine weight 

• Top position in engine class through efficient dynamics 

• Utilization of innovations for customer benefit 

By implementing some of the latest technology into the N52 engine, BMW met the 
objectives by improving the power to weight ratio, reduced emissions and decreased fuel 
consumption.

N52B30 Engine 

The simplest way of achieving these objectives was to reduce the weight of the engine. 
By utilizing new engine development technology the N52 variant is 10 Kg (22 lbs) lighter 
than its predecessor, as a result of: 

• New composite magnesium-aluminum crankcase 

• Lightweight exhaust manifold 

• Magnesium bedplate 

• Magnesium cylinder head cover. 

Improvements have also been made with regard to the Valvetronic system (Valvetronic II) 
along with a new 3 stage DISA intake manifold, electric coolant pump and a new Engine 
Management (MSV70). 

The introduction of these improvements provides the N52 with a 12% reduction in fuel 
consumption and a 10% increase in dynamics, compared to the previous engine 
(M54/M56). The increases in efficiency allow the N52 to comply with ULEVII standards. 

For the U.S. Market the N52 engine will be available in the 330i and 325i, both engine 
variants will be designated N52B30.

Transmissions 


On the E90 a six speed manual transmission (GS6-37BZ) will be standard and a six 
speed automatic transmission with STEPTRONIC (GA6HP19Z) will be optional. 

Manual Transmission 

The Manual Transmission (GS6-37BZ) available on the E90 is the same as that used 
previously on the E46 and currently on the E60 & E85. The transmission has a lifetime 
oil fill. 



For the first time the 3 series will see a six speed Automatic Transmission (GA6HP19Z) 
with STEPTRONIC. 



The transmission is similar to that used in the E60 with the M54 engine. In order to 
utilize this transmission on the E90 changes were made to: 

• Outer gearshift mechanism with electrical interlock 

• New transmission control module 

• Adapted hole circle diameter at the output flange

Cable Assembly 


The external gearshift mechanism consists of the selector 
lever with the following components: 

• Cable assembly to gearbox 

• Solenoid valve for shiftlock function 

• Solenoid valve for interlock function 

• Microswitch for detecting locked shift lever 

• Emergency release of interlock function 

• Switch unit for Steptronic function 

• Selector lever position switch indicator 

Cable Assembly 

The cable assembly is the mechanical connection between the selector lever and the 
inner gearshift mechanism (mechatronics module). The drive stages are preselected 
and the parking lock engaged with the aid of the cable assembly. 


13 

E90 Powertrain 














■ Shiftlock 

The shiftlock function prevents the vehicle from inadvertently being placed in gear with 
the ignition on, unless the brake pedal is depressed. A solenoid is used to lock the shift 
lever in position P or N once the ignition is swithed off and the lever has been placed into 
position P or N. The solenoid is activated by a switched ground signal from the 
Transmission Control Module 

Interlock 

The interlock function prevents removal of the 
remote control “key” when the selector lever 
is not in position P . The selector lever 
remains locked in position P if the remote 
control “key” is not inserted in its slot. For 
this purpose, the selector lever is locked in 
position P by two electric magnets once the 
ignition is switched off. 

Interlock Without Comfort Access: 

The selector lever is locked in position P after 
ignition OFF and the radio remote control 
“key” can be removed. 

The microswitch on the selector lever unit 
monitors the lock state of the selector lever 
and sends the signal to the CAS to release 
the radio remote control once the selector 
lever is in position R 


Interlock with Comfort Access: 

When the vehicle is stationary, the engine 
or terminal 15 can only be turned off when 
the selector lever is in position R

Emergency Release Pawl for Interlock 



Emergency Release 

In case of an emergency (e.g. failure of the power supply system), the selector lever can 
be released by operating the emergency release. The emergency release is accessible 
by removing the selector lever cover. The selector lever is released by pressing on the 
pawl (1).

E90 Powertrain 
















Transmission Control Module 

The newly developed Transmission Control Module (GS 19.11) is used for the automatic 
transmission GA6HP19Z (in all models). Compared to its predecessor (GS 19.04) it 
offers the following advantages: 

• Flash memory expanded from 512 Kbit to 1 MB 

• Designed to withstand higher temperatures 

• Electromagnetic compatibility considerably improved 

• Reserve for further functions 

The Transmission Control Module is located on the mechatronics module in the gearbox 
with the same housing and pin assignments from the previous version. 

Torque Converter 

A torque converter (LUK) with a two-layer torque converter lockup clutch is used. 

Stationary Disconnection 

The gearbox features a stationary disconnection (uncoupling) function for the torque con¬ 
verter. The torque converter is disconnected from the drivetrain instead of running the 
engine against the torque converter when the vehicle is stationary. By disconnecting the 
torque converter with the vehicle stationary, the engine is subject to minimum load and 
fuel consumption is reduced. 

Disconnection (uncoupling) of the torque converter is achieved as a function of the 
following signals: 

• Brake operated 

• Selector lever position D 

• Gear oil temperature > 20°C and < 120°C 

• No trailer signal applied

188 L (i = 3.64) 


The differential unit 188 L (L = low friction) is used for the first time on the 3 series. 

The 188 L differential uses angular-contact ball bearings (1), compared to the linear con¬ 
tact of tapered roller bearings, the point contact of the angular-contact ball bearings pro¬ 
duces less friction. By reducing friction the temperature of the gearbox is reduced which 
in turn increases efficiency. 

The differential utilizes a lifetime fill oil. 

Output Shafts 

Solid shafts, torsionally-rigid hollow shafts or torsionally-flexible hollow shafts are used 
depending on the engine-gearbox combination. 

The joint size also varies corresponding to the engine-gearbox combination.
