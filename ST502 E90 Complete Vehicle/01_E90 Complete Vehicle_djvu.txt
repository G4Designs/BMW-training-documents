BMW started the sport sedan category. 

Now with the fifth generation 3 series, the E90, BMW has succeeded in raising the bar 
for other manufacturers to strive for. 


The new 3 series is longer, wider, and lower than the previous generation E46 while 
retaining the same weight and even higher handling and performance characteristics. 

The body is 25% more rigid than the E46 sedan. 


The E90 comes equipped with two variants of a revolutionary new generation 6-cylinder 
engine; The N52B25 and the N52B30. 


The interior of the vehicle has also not gone unnoticed. This “base” version BMW now 
receives many of the technological advances of its “bigger” siblings. These features 
include but are not limited to: 


• Voice Recognition * 

• iDrive * 

• Comfort Access (from 9/2005) * 

• ACC* 


• Stolen Vehicle Recovery * 

• MOST bus technology * 

• Active Front Steering * 

• IHKA * 


* When adequately equipped 

We’ll start out by reviewing the BMW History of the original Sport Coupe concept.

E90 Heritage - 2002-2002tii 



1968 - The legendary BMW 2002 was not only the predecessor to the 3 Series, but also 
the first automobile on U.S. soil to combine the practicality of a passenger vehicle, 
with the spirited driving characteristics of a sports car. In effect, the 2002 was the 
car that forever changed the thinking of an industry and the expectations of auto¬ 
motive consumers at large. A compact Sports Sedan with a powerful 2-liter 
engine, it offered impressive driving performance in an efficient and comfortable 
passenger vehicle. This was the best possible combination for a country of 
motorists with miles of new roads, but faced with high gasoline prices. The 
American public and automotive press greeted the concept, and the car, with 
overwhelming enthusiasm. It wasn't long before the 2002 reached cult status 
among automotive aficionados. The pattern was clearly established for the future 
3 Series, and in turn, for the long term success of BMW in North America.

1977 - After getting a taste of the 2002's magic, American auto enthusiasts were 

hooked and could hardly wait for more of the invigorating driving experience only 
to be found at the wheel of a BMW. When the 320i hit American showroom 
floors, enthusiasts became fanatics, and skeptics, true believers. As the succes¬ 
sor to the 2002, the 320i was a big improvement, with a slightly larger size, even 
more refined handling, and better ventilation. However, it remained faithful to 
many styling cues unique to the 2002, like the forward-leaning grille, low waist¬ 
line, and large glass area. Powered by a 110-hp, 2.0-liter, Bosch K-Jetronic fuel- 
injected, inline four-cylinder engine, the 320i was able to meet stricter emissions 
regulations without a catalytic converter, while preserving the spirited driving 
characteristics motorists had come to relish in the 2002 it replaced. The 320i 
was given both cosmetic and engineering updates until 1983 when its produc¬ 
tion run finally ended.

1984 -With the release of the second-generation 3 Series, the 318i, BMW took a delib¬ 
erate approach in evolving the car on which the success of all other models 
would hinge. At first, the changes were nearly all aesthetic, a more aerodynamic 
design being the most obvious. The previously forward-leaning grille was now 
more upright and connected to a gently sloping hood. But what stood out even 
more to consumers and critics alike was the improved fit and finish of the car. As 
the years passed, the 325i was offered alongside the 318i and featured increased 
engine power, and new safety features like ABS brakes and airbags. By the time 
the 318i and 325i had completed their production runs, the 3 Series had fully 
matured, gaining a full range of body styles, and a very loyal following.

E90 Heritage - E36 



1992 - Having firmly established the 3 Series as the benchmark in the Sports Sedan 
class, the pressure was on BMW to hold off legions of would-be competitors. 
With this in mind, BMW engineers conceived and executed an entirely new car. 
The third-generation 3 Series, including both the four-cylinder 318i and six-cylin¬ 
der 325i, was no longer a new interpretation of the 2002, but rather a clearly new, 
thoroughly modern design. This all-new 3 Series featured a sleek wedge-like 
shape that improved aerodynamics and reduced wind noise. In nearly all dimen¬ 
sions, it was larger than the earlier 318i. And the additional space paid off in both 
passenger room and driving dynamics. Technological innovations were a key part 
of the 325i's successful 7-year run, which was capped off by the re-badged 328i 
that featured a more powerful 2.8-liter engine, offering much more torque. From 
its sophisticated new suspension, to a VANOS variable valve timing system, trac¬ 
tion control and side airbags, the BMW 325i was a machine on the leading edge 
of automotive technology.

E90 Heritage - E46 



1999 -The evolution of the 3 Series took another major step forward with the introduc¬ 
tion of the 323i and 328i, the fourth generation of 3 Series. A sculpted new body 
design featured even cleaner lines, wider wheel arches, a more rounded roofline, 
and a distinct front end highlighted by "cutout"-styled lowered headlight lenses, 
giving the car a strikingly modern look. Beyond the new sheet metal, the new 3 
Series had made significant gains in structural rigidity, passenger room, and safety 
features, one of the most significant being Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). Of 
course, engine technology also advanced, gaining both Double VANOS variable 
valve timing and dual resonance intake systems. In 2001, more powerful engine 
options became available in the new 325i and 330i, and two new models featur¬ 
ing all-wheel-drive were also introduced to the 3 Series lineup. The 325xi and 
330xi brought a new dimension of performance and versatility to the segment¬ 
defining Sports Sedan. Over the next few years, minor cosmetic updates accom¬ 
panied the 330i until March 2003, when an optional performance package offered 
a boost in engine power, sportier suspension, huge 18-inch low-profile tires, and 
an Alcantara-covered steering wheel. Overall, substantial technological and engi¬ 
neering advancements were made throughout the 3 Series lineup from 1999 to 
2004. An optional DVD-based navigation system, rain-sensing wipers, automatic 
headlights, and a sophisticated new six-speed SMG (Seguential Manual Gearbox) 
transmission had all joined the 3 Series party by the close of the 2004 model year.

2006 - Now 38 years after the 2002 that started it all, the all-new 3 Series is once again 
poised to make a legendary mark in automotive history. The all-new 3 Series 
incorporates all the trademarks of its predecessors: the double-kidney grille, the 
"power dome" hood, and the "Hoffmeister kink" in a progressive, sporty, yet ele¬ 
gant new design. Overall, the dimensions are significantly greater than the corre¬ 
sponding dimensions of the 325i and 330i it replaces, adding both interior pas¬ 
senger room and wheelbase length. As is the case with all previous 3 Series, 
innovative engineering is an integral part of the equation. The pioneering use of 
weight-saving magnesium in the crankcase, a newly developed double-pivot alu¬ 
minum front suspension, a new five-link rear suspension made of lightweight 
steel, and the lighter, 25% stiffer body shell of the all-new 3 are the embodiment 
of this philosophy. Technologically advanced six-cylinder engines once again 
deliver silky-smooth response, with 255-hp on tap in the 330i's new 3.0-liter 
engine. On the inside, the all-new 3 Series continues the harmonious balance 
between sportiness and elegance, with an ergonomically designed cockpit for the 
driver and purposeful materials carefully choreographed to please the senses of 
all occupants. Every detail, from the roundel on the hood to the roundel on the 
trunk, qualifies the all-new 3 Series to carry on the storied tradition of the most 
celebrated Sports Sedan of all time.

Front Bumper 

The trim panel can withstand impacts of speeds of up to 4 km/h. The bumper carrier 
absorbs forces at speeds between 4 km/h and 8 km/h while deformation elements 
absorb the forces between 8 km/h and 15 km/h. The engine supports are only affected 
by impacts at speeds in excess of 15 km/h. 

The bumper system therefore consists of the trim panel with the carrier behind it as well 
as the deformation elements behind that. If applicable, the PDC sensors and fog lights 
are accommodated in the trim panel. 



Front Bumper 


Front End 

After removing the bumper trim panel, the complete front end, including the bumper 
carrier, headlights, air ducts and bonnet locks, can be removed.

The rear light clusters of the E90 are equipped with conventional bulb technology. LEDs 
are not used. They are designed as two-piece units with one part secured in the trunk lid 
and the other part in the rear side panel. 

Four lamp bulbs per rear light cluster serve the brake light, direction indicator light, revers¬ 
ing light, tail light and rear fog light. 

A flap can be removed in the luggage compartment trim panel for the purpose of replac¬ 
ing the bulbs. The lamp carrier is accessible. It is clipped into the rear light cluster and 
carries all the lamp bulbs. 

It is necessary to undo three lock nuts in order to remove the rear light units in the side 
panels.

Rear Bumper System 

The rear bumper panel is secured with screws from the wheel arch side and from the 
underside. There are also two screws behind the covers in the upper area. 

Great care must be taken when working with the side plug connections as they can be 
easily damaged. 

The steel carrier which features two crash boxes and is screw-mounted to the body is 
located behind the bumper trim panel. 

The trim panel is designed such that it can withstand small impacts at speeds of up to 4 
km/h without damage. The bumper carrier absorbs forces at speeds between 4-8 km/h. 
The crash boxes deform and absorb impacts at speeds up to about 15 km/h. The sheet 
metal components of the vehicle structure are only affected by impacts at higher speeds. 

The sensors for the PDC are additionally integrated in the bumper trim panel. 



Rear Bumper 

Rear Hatch 

The trunk lid is made of steel. It is equipped with two gas-charged piston springs. 

The trunk lid lock as well as part of the tail light units are integral. The inner trim panel 
must be detached in order to remove these parts. The inner trim panel is secured with 
plugs. 

Stop pads and slots in the hinges are provided for the purpose of adjusting the boot lid. A 
bowden cable connects the boot lid lock to the lock barrel.

Luggage Compartment 

The E90 is equipped with run-flat tires as standard, there is no spare wheel in the lug¬ 
gage compartment. The battery and control units for PDC, AHM, and Comfort Access 
are located on the right-hand side. 

If the vehicle is equipped with a Top-HiFi amplifier and/or CD changer, they are arranged 
on the side panel on the left side of the luggage compartment. A telephone control unit is 
additionally located in the center next to the satellite radio tuner. 

The luggage compartment has a capacity of 330 liters. By folding down the rear seats, 
the capacity can be increased to 1,150 liters. 

Moonroof (SHD) 

A glass slide/tilt sunroof is standard equipment on the E90. 

For servicing purposes, the glass panel can be adjusted or removed and installed by 
means of well-accessible screws. The visor can also be detached. It is spring-mounted in 
the cassette. 

The electric motor is held by screws. A new feature is that the control unit is no longer 
located on the motor but rather it is integrated in the FZD. 

The wind deflector and water drain channel can also be detached without having to 
remove the sunroof cassette from the vehicle. 

There are currently no provisions for replacing the cable assemblies. In this case, the 
entire sunroof cassette should be replaced. 

The SHD requires initialization following assembly. This is achieved by pressing the push¬ 
button in the tilt position. The system is initialized after 20 seconds.

Front Door 


The front door is made from steel. It features a side impact protection system together 
with its anchoring. 

The door handle is painted in the car color. Only the driver’s door has access to locking 
and unlocking using a mechanical key. 

Only one screw needs to be undone in order to remove the door handle. The door han¬ 
dles with comfort access are additionally equipped with a plug for the antennas. 

The door trim panel is attached to the door by means of three mounting screws. Unlike 
the E46, there is no airbag integrated in the door trim panel. The side airbag is now incor¬ 
porated in the seat. 

A sound insulation mat that also keeps away moisture is adhered to the back of the door 
trim panel. 


Another new feature is the clip-mounted window that is connected by means of clips to 
the power window regulator.

Roof Liner 

Two control units are clipped into the roof liner of the E90. The roof functions center 
(FZD) is located in the front area and the ultrasonic passenger compartment protection 
(USIS) in the rear. 

The headliner is installed at the production plant before the windscreen. To provide 
sufficient space for removal and installation without damage being incurred, it is recom¬ 
mended to remove at least one front seat.

Center Console 

No parts of the instrument panel need to be removed in order to dismantle the center 
console. The covers at the rear end of the center console and selector lever must be 
removed in order to access the screw connections. There are also two mounting screws 
located in the front area beneath the instrument panel. 

The MRS5 control unit and, if fitted, antennas for the CAS are arranged under the center 
console.
