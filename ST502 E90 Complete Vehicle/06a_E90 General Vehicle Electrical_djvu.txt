Introduction 


With the new 3 Series multiple control modules will be involved in the operation of a sys¬ 
tem, similar to the “distributed functions” approach which has been successfully imple¬ 
mented on the E60, E63/64, E65 & E66. With the launch of the E90, the distributed 
function concept will be continued and further developed. 

The associated optimization of the wiring/cabling through fewer interfaces is also an 
important aspect when evaluating cost reduction and assembly time. 

For diagnosis, on the other hand, the concept of "distributed functions" signifies a new 
challenge. In terms of the control module, it is no longer apparent what functions it initi¬ 
ates. 

In the E90 there are several systems (i.e. Central Locking, Power Windows and Interior 
Lighting) whose functions are distributed over the following control modules:

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 












To get a better understanding of the concept of “distributed functions” using the Central 
Locking System as an example. 

To date (E46), the "Central Locking" function was located primarily in the General Module 
(GM) or, on the E60 in the Basic Body Module (KBM) and the door modules. 

The "Central Locking" function in the E90 is distributed over several control modules 
(Car Access System, Junction Box Electronics Control Module & Footwell Module). 
Distributing functions over several control module offers the advantage that sensors and 
actuators are connected directly to a control module in the vicinity of their installed loca¬ 
tion, which result is shorter cable connections. By interlinking the control modules, it is 
possible to exchange sensor data between them. 

The primary control modules for the systems in the E90 are: 

• Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

• Car Access 2 (CAS2) 

• Footwell Module (FRM) 

• Roof Function Center (FZD) 

The distributed functions concept is used/identified in the 
following General Vehicle Electrical Systems: 

• Central Locking (ZV)) 

• Comfort Access (CA) 

• Interior Lighting (IB) 

• Power Windows (FH) 

• Slide/tilt Sunroof (SHD) 

• Anti-theft Alarm System (DWA) 

• Electronic Steering Lock (ELV) 

• Wiper Washer System 

• Park Distance Control (PDC) 

• Vehicle Exterior Lighting 

• Adaptive Headlight Control 

• Steering Column Switch Cluster (SZL) 

• Outside Mirror

Central Locking 

On the E90, all doors as well as the trunk lid and fuel filler flap are integrated into the 
Central Locking System. 

The central locking can be operated via the following components: 

• Remote control/identification transmitter 

• Driver's door lock barrel (door lock) 

• Center-lock button 

• Electronic outer door handle module (TAGE) in connection with comfort access

Car Access System 2 (CAS2) 

As soon as the CAS2 receives the lock/unlock signal from the remote control receiver, it 
checks whether the identification transmitter is valid and belongs to the vehicle. Only if 
the check/authentication, which takes a few milliseconds, is successful will the CAS2 for¬ 
ward the reguest to activate the central locking. 

The CAS2, serves as the master control module for the central locking system, as it 
issues the enable signal to activate a lock/unlock function. An enable status signal is 
transmitted to the JBE from CAS2 via K-CAN. 

Signal Path: Remote control to remote receiver to CAS2; or 

Central lock button input to CAS2; 

Enable signal from CAS2 to JBE via K-CAN (if all doors are closed) 

Door status signal from FRM to JBE via K-CAN then JBE via K-Can to 
CAS2 

Example: The reguest to lock the vehicle, is not executed while the driver's door is 

open. 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The Junction Box Electronics Control Module is responsible for implementing the 
lock/unlock operation for the entire vehicle, as it contains the lock/unlock relays which in 
turn drive the respective lock/unlock motors. 

The following central locking relays are activated by JBE: 

• Driver's door 

• Rear doors 

• Front passenger's door 

• Fuel filler flap 

The central locking function for the trunk lid is activated directly via a power output stage. 

Signal Path: Enable signal from CAS2 to JBE via K-CAN; JBE activates lock/unlock func¬ 
tion via direct activation of relay(s) 

Footwell Module (FRM) 

The Footwell Module (FRM) monitors the hall sensors of the door contacts to determine 
if a door is open or closed. CAS2 indirectly obtains the door status information and uses 
the information to determine if an enable signal is to be provided to the JBE. 

Signal Path: Door contact signals input to FRM; Door status signal from FRM to JBE via 

K-CAN then forwarded from JBE via K-Can to CAS2. 


21 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Unlocking/Locking the Vehicle 

The central locking system can be activated only when the driver's door is closed. 

The vehicle unlocking/locking procedure is initiated by the following system components: 

• Remote control/identification transmitter 

• Center-lock button 

• Mechanical key/spare key 

Note: The identification transmitter is incorporated with the remote control 

function and is used solely for Comfort Access. The vehicle activates the 
identification transmitter by way of a radio signal from the Comfort 
Access System. This makes it possible to unlock the vehicle without 
actively using the identification transmitter. 


The central locking system activates the following system components: 


• Central locking, driver's and front passenger's door 

• Central locking, rear doors 

• Central locking, fuel tank 

• Central locking, trunk lid 

Example: If the vehicle is unlocked using identification transmitter/remote control the 

unlocking procedures is as shown below.

Unlocking Procedure 

As soon as the unlock button on the identification transmitter is pressed, the signal initial¬ 
ly reaches the rear window antenna followed by the remote control receiver. The remote 
control receiver is located in the diversity module and forwards the signal to the CAS2. 
The signal from the identification transmitter is verified in the CAS2. If the signal is recog¬ 
nized as valid, the JBE is enabled for the purpose of unlocking the central locking drive 
units. The JBE now activates the relay to trigger the vehicle unlocking procedure. 

Locking Procedure 

The vehicle can be locked only after the Footwell Module has evaluated the door con¬ 
tacts and the CAS2 signals that the doors are closed. 

Using Identification Transmitter 

The identification transmitter sends out a coded signal as soon as the unlock or lock but¬ 
ton is pressed. 

The signal from the identification transmitter is demodulated and conditioned in the 
remote control receiver. This signal is then made available to the car access system 2. 

All central locking drive units assume the "lock" position during the vehicle locking proce¬ 
dure. The central locking drive units in the doors additionally assume the "central arrest" 
position. 

On conclusion of the central arrest procedure, the locking buttons in the doors are 
mechanically separated from the central locking drive system. The vehicle can then no 
longer be unlocked using the locking buttons in the doors. 

The trunk lid can also be opened separately with the identification transmitter. 

Center-Lock Button 

The vehicle can be locked/unlocked with the center-lock button. The CAS 2 receives a 
high signal (battery voltage approx. 12 V) when the center-lock button is not pressed. 

The high signal changes to a low signal (approx. 0 V) as soon as the center-lock button is 
pressed. 

The CAS 2 evaluates the change from the high signal to the low signal and locks/unlocks 
the vehicle. The signal from the center-lock button is looped through the Junction Box 
Electronics Control Module. 

Mechanical Key/Spare Key 

The footwell module evaluates the Hall sensors for the lock barrel in the driver's door. 

The CAS2 is informed of the change in status via the K-CAN. 

The CAS2 enables the vehicle unlocking/locking procedure. The JBE initiates the vehi¬ 
cle unlocking/ locking procedure. 


23 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Locking Button on Vehicle Doors 

All four doors can be locked mechanically, by using the separate locking buttons. 

If the button on the door is depressed, then the inner door handle of the door to be 
unlocked must be pulled twice to unlock the vehicle door. 

In this situation the Junction Box Electronics Control Module does not activate the cen¬ 
tral locking. 

Opening the Trunk Lid 

The trunk lid can be unlocked via the remote control, the identification transmitter, the 
outer or inner trunk lid release button. 

Opening with Remote Control/Identification Transmitter 

The trunk lid is opened with the remote control/identification transmitter by pressing on 
the trunk lid symbol. The trunk lid opens irrespective of whether the vehicle is locked or 
not. 

The motor in the lock of the trunk lid is activated via a power output stage in the JBE in 
order to open the trunk lid. 

Opening with the Outer Trunk Lid Button 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked, the trunk lid can be opened by pressing the outer 
trunk lid button. 

The microswitch switches to ground when the outer trunk lid button is pressed. 

The JBE monitors the microswitch. The trunk lid is unlocked and opened when the sig¬ 
nal from the microswitch goes to low. 

Opening with the InnerTrunk Lid Button 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked, the trunk lid can be opened by pressing the inner 
trunk lid button. 

The inner trunk lid button is installed on the A-pillar on the driver's side. It switches to 
ground. The microswitch is routed directly to the CAS2. As soon as the signal of the

Special Functions 


Automatic Locking (Personal Profile) 

The vehicle is locked automatically when driving at a speed in excess of 16 km/h. The 
speed signal is made available by the DSC module. 

The vehicle is unlocked in connection with Comfort Access (CA) as soon as terminal 15 
is switched off. 

On vehicles without Comfort Access (CA), the unlocking procedure is triggered by 
removing the remote control from its holder. 

Selective Unlocking 

With corresponding coding, the vehicle can also be unlocked selectively. In this case, the 
driver's door is initially unlocked. The rest of the vehicle is unlocked in response to a 
renewed unlock request. 

Unlocking After an Accident 

A locked central locking system is unlocked as soon as the CAS2 receives a crash mes¬ 
sage from the Multiple Restraint System 5 (MRS5). 

On receiving the crash signal, the center-lock button and the remote control receiver are 
inhibited for the central locking functions. The center-lock button and the remote control 
receiver are enabled again only after the a change in terminal R OFF/terminal R ON.

Comfort Access 


Comfort Access (SA 322) is offered as an option for the E90. 

"Comfort Access" is a passive access system. This means the vehicle is unlocked by 
grasping the outer door handle, provided the identification transmitter is located within a 
radius of no more than approx. .5 -1.5 m from the vehicle. 

With Comfort Access it is sufficient for the driver to simply carry the identification trans¬ 
mitter on his/her person in order to open or start the vehicle. "Keyless" access to the 
vehicle was implemented for the first time on the E65 and has been adapted for the 
E90. 

As with many of these systems the operation/functions are distributed among several 
different control modules. Comfort Access utilizes the same modules that are utilized 
for the Central Locking function plus two more.

Control Modules for Comfort Access Function 


Car Access System 2 (CAS2) 

As soon as the CAS2 receives a request signal it must verify if a valid ID Transmitter is 
located with range of the antenna. CAS2 requires that the antenna in the area of the 
request transmit a request for validation to the ID Transmitter. 

The ID transmitter transmits a signal to the remote control receiver, which in turn forwards 
the signal to the CAS2 where the signal is checked to be valid and belonging to the vehi¬ 
cle. Only if the check/authentication, which takes a few milliseconds, is successful will 
the CAS2 forward the request to activate the specific function. 

The CAS2, serves as the master control module for the central locking system, as it 
issues the enable signal to activate a lock/unlock function. An enable status signal is 
transmitted to the JBE from CAS2 via K-CAN. 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The Junction Box Electronics Control Module is responsible for implementing the 
lock/unlock operation for the entire vehicle, as it contains the lock/unlock relays which in 
turn drive the respective lock/unlock motors. 

The following central locking relays are activated by JBE: 

• Driver's door 

• Rear doors 

• Front passenger's door 

• Fuel filler flap 

The central locking function for the trunk lid is activated directly via a power output stage. 

Signal Path: Enable signal from CAS2 to JBE via K-CAN; JBE activates lock/unlock func¬ 
tion via direct activation of relay(s) 

Footwell Module (FRM) 

The Footwell Module (FRM) monitors the hall sensors of the door contacts to determine 
if a door is open or closed. CAS2 indirectly obtains the door status information and uses 
the information to determine if an enable signal is to be provided to the JBE. 

Signal Path: Door contact signals input to FRM; Door status signal from FRM to JBE via 

K-CAN then forwarded from JBE via K-Can to CAS2. 

Comfort Access Control Module 

The Comfort Access Module controls/activates the antennas located on the exterior and 
interior of the vehicle, plus reads/transfers the data received from the Electronic Outer 
Door Handle Module to the CAS2. 


36 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Electronic Outer Door Handle Module (TAGE) 

The Electronic Outer Door Handle Module (TAGE) transmits door handle status data via 
CAS BUS(K-BUS) to the Comfort Access module, which in turn forwards the data to 
CAS2. Information from the door handle that is transmitted is primarily related to 
changes at the capacitive sensors and hall sensors integrated into the door handle. 

Functions of Comfort Access 


The main advantages of Comfort Access (CA) are: 

• Passive Entry - Unlocking the vehicle without actively using the ID transmitter 

• Passive Go -Starting engine without inserting the ID transmitter into its holder 

• Passive Exit - Locking authorization without actively using the ID transmitter

Note: In connection with the comfort access system, the vehicle must activate 
the identification transmitter by means of a radio signal so that the trans¬ 
mitter is registered with the vehicle (authentication). 


37 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 
















































Passive Entry 

Passive entry enables access to the vehicle without operating the Identification 
Transmitter/Remote Control. 


Note: The vehicle cannot be woken and opened without a valid ID transmitter 
being present within a .5-1.5 m radius from a specific external antenna. 

The vehicle in sleep mode is woken with the presence of a valid ID transmitter/remote 
control and activation of the Comfort Access System is started by grasping the outer 
door handle. 

Unlocking 

The capacitive sensor in the Electronic Outer Door Handle Module (TAGE) recognizes 
that the handle has been grasped and activates the transmit antenna. The transmit 
antenna sends a 125 kHz signal to the identification transmitter. In turn, the identification 
transmitter sends a 315 MHz high frequency signal to the remote control receiver, which 
contains the authentication request. 

The CAS2 checks the authentication of the identification transmitter. 

Following successful authentication, the CAS2 issues the enable signal to unlock the 
vehicle and initiates the vehicle unlocking procedure. The JBE executes the unlocking 
procedure. 

Note: At this point the steering is not yet unlocked. 

Opening Trunk Lid 

An authentication check also takes place before opening the trunk lid, an identification 
transmitter must be located within the rear area of the vehicle. 

After successful authentication, the trunk lid can be unlocked and opened with the outer 
trunk lid button. 

Passive Go 

The passive go function makes it possible to start the vehicle without the ID transmitter 
being inserted in its holder. 

Note: The vehicle cannot be started without a valid ID transmitter being located 
in the interior of the vehicle. 

Issuing Start Enable 

After the door has been opened, the CAS2 starts the check after 3 s to establish whether 
there is a valid ID transmitter in the vehicle. The CAS2 instructs the Comfort Access 
control module to again send out the identifier for a valid ID transmitter. 

The Comfort Access Module sends the request via the interior antennas. 


38 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



The identification transmitter replies with a code via the high frequency link (315 MHz) to 
the remote control receiver. This code contains data for the electronic vehicle immobilizer. 

The car access system 2 issues the enable to start the engine for the DME/DDE and the 
electric steering lock is unlocked. 

Passive Exit 

The passive exit function makes it possible to lock the vehicle without actively using the 
ID transmitter/remote control. 

Note: The vehicle cannot be unlocked without a valid identification transmitter 
within a .5-1.5 m radius from a specific external antenna. 

Locking Procedure 

After the vehicle door has been closed, the locking procedure is started by touching the 
recognition point/area on the outer door handle. The electronic outer door handle mod¬ 
ule sends the request to lock the vehicle via the K-Bus to the Comfort Access System. 

Based on the exterior and/or interior antennas, the Comfort Access System checks where 
the ID transmitter is located. The ID transmitter is instructed to send an authentication 
signal. In turn, the identification sensor sends encrypted data via the high frequency link 
to the remote control receiver. 

The CAS2 checks whether the ID transmitter is valid. Upon successful completion of the 
check, the CAS2 issues the enable signal to lock the drive units and initiates the steering 
locking procedure. 

The JBE activates the central locking drive units. 


39 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Special Comfort Access Functions 

The Comfort Access System additionally features special functions that are determined 
by the actions of the vehicle user such as: 


ID Transmitters Remain in Vehicle 

If an ID transmitter remains in the vehicle interior, by checking via the interior antennas, 
the car access system 2 recognizes whether there is a valid identification transmitter in 
the vehicle interior. 


If a valid identification transmitter is detected in the vehicle interior and the vehicle is 
locked by means of another valid identification transmitter, the identification transmitter 
located in the vehicle interior is set to "invalid". 


For the Comfort Access System, this identification transmitter is considered as no longer 
belonging to the vehicle until the vehicle is unlocked again. 


ID Transmitter Remains in Trunk 

If an ID transmitter is in luggage compartment, upon closing the trunk lid, it is immediately 
opened (automatically). 

If there is an identification transmitter in the luggage compartment of the locked vehicle 
with the trunk lid open. An audible and visual signal draws the customer's attention to the 
fact that the identification transmitter has been left in the luggage compartment. 

On request from the CAS2, the Comfort Access control module starts the check via the 
interior antennas. The valid identification transmitter in the luggage compartment is rec¬ 
ognized via the luggage compartment antenna. Consequently, the CAS2 does not issue 
the enable signal to lock the trunk lid. 

The trunk lid cannot be closed before the ID transmitter has been removed and is located 
outside the luggage compartment. 

Note: An ID transmitter can be locked in the truck if a second valid ID transmit¬ 
ter is identified as being on the exterior of the vehicle within the radius of 
the bumper antenna or if the valet function is active. 


Engine Start Disable 

The engine cannot be started if the identification transmitter is located in the luggage 
compartment of the unlocked vehicle. 

Note: The CAS2 issues the enable signal for starting the engine only when a 
valid identification transmitter has been detected in the vehicle interior. 


40 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Starting Engine without ID Transmitter 

The function makes it possible to start the vehicle within 10 s after "engine OFF" without 
detecting the identification transmitter. This function is intended for cases where the 
identification transmitter is not detected due to high frequency interference, as an exam¬ 
ple. 

Check Control Message, Terminal 15 

The Comfort Access System enables terminal selection without the ID transmitter being 
inserted in its holder. It is possible that terminal 15 is selected by pressing the START- 
STOP button. A corresponding check control message is shown in the instrument clus¬ 
ter after the door is opened. An audible signal also sounds. 

Note: The battery may be discharged if the driver ignores the warnings 
and locks the vehicle. 

Unintentional Wake-up Function 

The sensors are subject to a check procedure in order to avoid waking the electronic 
outer door handle module by touching the outer door handle without a valid identification 
transmitter. 

The identification transmitter is requested to send an authentication signal. If no valid ID 
transmitter is detected, the electronic outer door handle module receives this information 
from the CAS2. In this case, the electronic outer door handle module remains inactive 
until a valid identification transmitter is detected. 

Locking with Engine Running 

The vehicle can also be unlocked with the engine running if the engine was started with 
passive go. When leaving the vehicle, the ID transmitter must also be taken and the vehi¬ 
cle locked from the outside.

Identification Transmitter 

The identification transmitter for Comfort Access must be actuated by means of a coded 
125 kHz radio signal that is transmitted from the Electronic Outer Door Handle Module or 
exterior antenna. The coded 125 kHz radio signal enables the ID transmitter to transmits 
a coded 315 MHz high frequency validation signal that is received by the remote control 
receiver and forwarded to the CAS2, which determines if the ID Transmitter as valid and 
belongs to the vehicle. 

The ID transmitter is exclusively responsible for use/operation of the Comfort Access 
System. 

The ID transmitter does not need to be operated to enable access to the vehicle, it simply 
needs be carried on the person that is accessing/operating the vehicle. 

The ID transmitter for Comfort Access uti¬ 
lizes a replaceable battery, which is the 
identifiable difference when compared to 
the regular remote control that has an inte¬ 
grated rechargeable battery. The ID trans¬ 
mitter for Comfort Access does not need to 
be inserted in the holder in order to start the 
vehicle it just needs to be located in the 
interior of the vehicle in order to start the 
engine. 

The service life of the battery in the ID 
Transmitter is about 2 years. 

Voltage Monitoring 

The ID Transmitter monitors its own battery voltage in two stages: 

• First stage the ID Transmitter signals to the CAS2 that the battery is "flat" (dis¬ 
charged). In response, the CAS 2 generates a check control message. The check 
control message informs the customer that the battery needs to be changed. 

• Second Stage if the battery is not changed, the voltage monitoring facility initiates a 
function which saves the data in the ID Transmitter is saved and then ID Transmitter 
is set/made "inoperable".

Antennas for Comfort Access 

Six antennas are installed for the comfort access system. Three antennas are located in 
the exterior and three in the interior. 

The antennas for the exterior and interior are inductive antennas and have a ferrite core 
which contributes to their compact size. This is of particular advantage for accommodat¬ 
ing the antennas in the outer door handles. 

The transmit freguency of the antennas is 125 kHz. All messages that are sent via the 
antennas are encrypted. 

Locations of Exterior Antennas 

The exterior antennas are installed in the following locations on the E90: 

• Door Handle, Driver's side 

• Door Handle, Passenger's side 

• Rear Bumper 

Locations of Interior Antennas 

The interior antennas are installed in the following locations on the E90: 

• Passenger Compartment, Front 

• Passenger Compartment, Centre 

• Luggage Compartment 



44 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Antenna in Outer Door Handles 

The antenna in the outer door handles is an integral part of the electronic outer door han¬ 
dle module. The antenna characteristic is structured such that it covers the area about 
the vehicle doors. 

Antenna in Bumper 

The antenna in the rear bumper is of the same design as the interior antennas. It features 
a waterproof plug connection to ensure no water enters the antenna. 

The antenna characteristic is structured such that it covers the rear area and enables 
access to the luggage compartment. 

Antennas for the Passenger Compartment 

The antenna characteristic is spherical. The entire vehicle interior is covered by the two 
interior antennas. 

The interior antennas are important for checking whether there is an identification trans¬ 
mitter located in the interior. 

Antenna for Luggage Compartment 

Due to its design, the luggage compartment acts as a "separate" area in the vehicle. This 
arrangement makes it easier for the comfort access system to identify the identification 
transmitter in the luggage compartment. 

The luggage compartment antenna is of the same design as the interior antenna. The 
antenna characteristic is laid out such that it covers the entire luggage compartment.

Exterior Antenna 


The electronic outer door handle module is connected to the vehicle via the K-Bus thus 
making available the information from the capacitive sensors and the Hall sensor. 

Design 

The Electronic Outer Door Handle Module (TAGE) contains the following components: 

• 3 sensors 

- Capacitive sensor 1 for unlocking the vehicle 

- Capacitive sensor 2 for locking the vehicle 

- A Hall sensor for pulling the outer door handle 

• Inductive antenna for the exterior 

• Electronic module for outer door handle and interface for CAS-bus. 


46 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 














With the aid of 3 sensors, the TAGE module detects the status of the outer door handle. 
Each change in the status of the outer door handle module triggers on of the corre¬ 
sponding functions: 

• Trigger pulse when a hand is moved around the outer door handle; capacitive sensor 
1 

• Unlock reguest by pulling the outer door handle; Hall sensor 

• Lock reguest by touching the recognition point/area on the outer door handle; 
capacitive sensor 2 

Sensors 

To protect the battery, the TAGE module switches off the capacitive sensors for the dri¬ 
ver's side after the vehicle has been at rest for 192 hours. The capacitive sensors on the 
passenger's side are switched off after 72 hours. 

Functional Principle of the Capacitive Sensor 

The capacitive sensor consists of three capacitor plates (electrodes). The dielectric is the 
air gap between the door handle and the body/door panel of the vehicle. One capacitor 
plate is the car body including the surrounding vehicle. The other two capacitor plates 
are located in the outer door handle. 

The outer door handle is split in two parts with respect to the capacitor plates. One 
capacitor plate is in the outer door handle. The other capacitor plate is contained in the 
grooved area on the upper portion of the outer door handle. The functional principle of 
the capacitive sensor is based on a change in the electrical field between the capacitor 
plates, which results in a change in the capacitance of the capacitor. A change in capaci¬ 
tance occurs (increase) whenever a hand is placed between the body and the outer door 
handle (grabbing of the handle). The electronic circuitry in the outer door handle wakes 
up based on a defined change in capacitance, which is referred to as triggering. 

The capacitive sensor responds with a pulse only to fast changes in its capacitance. 
Changes in its environment such as slow soiling of the outer door handle or rain therefore 
have no influence on the function of the capacitive sensor. 

When unlocking/locking the vehicle, the sensors are mutually blocked for a period of 2 
sec., meaning that after locking, unlocking is inhibited for 2 sec and vice versa. 

Capacitive Sensor 1 

Capacitive Sensor 1 is responsible for initiating the Unlock request by generating pulse 
when a hand is held between the "capacitor plates", door handle and door panel/body. 
The pulse wakes up the electronic circuitry in the TAGE. If the vehicle is in sleep mode, 
the TAGE will send a wake up request via K-Bus to the Comfort Access Module and 
CAS2. CAS2 will request that a signal be sent from the external antenna to the ID 
Transmitter asking for a validation signal. The Comfort Access module switches on the 
remote control receiver in order to receive the validation signal sent from the ID transmit¬ 
ter.

Capacitor plate, capacitive sensor 1 


Capacitive Sensor 2 

A change in capacitance at sensor 2 is achieved by placing the thumb on the grooved 
area of the door handle. The change in capacitance generates a signal from sensor 2, 
resulting in the TAGE sending a lock request via the K-Bus (CAS-Bus) to the CAS2. 

Hall Sensor of the Outer Door Handle 

The Hall sensor is redundant to the capacitive sensor 1. If the TAGE has switched off the 
capacitive sensors, the Hall sensor is still operational after 192 hours which allows the 
unlocking procedure to also be started via the Hall sensor. 

The Hall sensor changes its status from low to high when the outer door handle is pulled. 
The TAGE monitors the status of the hall sensor and consequently detects whether 
access to the vehicle is requested. 

The monitoring cycle takes place every 40 ms in order to save the vehicle battery. A sig¬ 
nal is triggered when the sensor reaches a defined threshold. The electronic outer door 
handle module detects the signal and switches on the power supply of the Hall sensor for 
checking purposes.

Lock in Driver's Door & Front Passenger's Door 

The capacitive sensor 1 initiates the vehicle unlocking procedure. 

The lock in the driver's door and front passenger's door is equipped with an additional 
spring to ensure the vehicle can be opened fast enough. The spring exerts pretension on 
the central locking drive unit for the unlocking procedure. The door is already unlocked 
before an attempt is made to open it with the outer door handle. 

Note: If pulled very fast, however, it may be necessary to pull the outer door 
handle a second time in order to open the door.

Interior Lighting 

The components installed with the interior lighting system for the E90 are: 

• Interior Light with Interior Light Switch 

• Interior Light with Interior Light Switch 

• Reading Light with Reading Light Button, Driver and Passenger 

• Top Light, Driver and Passenger 

• Interior Light 

• Interior Light with Interior Light Switch 

• Reading Light with Reading Light Button, Driver and Passenger 

• Top Light, Driver and Passenger 

• Luggage Compartment Light

Control Modules for Interior Lighting 

The "interior lighting" function is distributed over several control module that communi¬ 
cate with each other via the K-CAN. 

• Footwell Module (FRM) is responsible for switching the interior lighting on & off. 

• Roof Functions Center (FZD) is responsible for the interior lighting components in 
the roof area. 

• Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) is the interface to the luggage & 
glove compartment lighting. 

• Car Access System 2 (CAS2) receives the unlock signal and sends the instructions 
through the footwell module to switch on the interior lighting. 

The interaction of these three control units is described in more detail on the following 
pages. 


55 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 





Footwell Module (FRM) 

All interior lighting outputs of the Footwell Module are pulse-modulated to ensure that 
the interior lighting functions are at a constant brightness level in the event of voltage 
fluctuations. The pulse width modulation is also used for the soft ON/OFF function. 

The Footwell Module features the following functions for the interior lighting: 

• Switching the interior lighting on/off 

• Electric load shut-down after 16 minutes 

• Instrument lighting, terminal 58g 

Switching on the Interior Lighting 

The footwell module receives numerous input signals that switch on the interior lighting. 
For instance, the input signals from the footwell module are read in directly or received via 
the K-CAN. 

The input signals for the interior lighting are listed in the following.

Switching-on Conditions 

The interior lighting is switched on in response to one of the following conditions: 

• Unlock via barrel lock in driver's door 

• Unlock via remote control/identification transmitter 

• Terminal R OFF when terminal 58g was ON 

• Receiving crash signal 

• Lock button on remote control/ ID transmitter pressed when the 
central locking has been in central arrest state for longer than 10 s 

• Interior lighting button pressed. 

Switching Off Interior Lighting 

The FRM receives numerous signals to switch off the interior lighting via the K-CAN or 
are obtained indirectly by the FRM. 


56 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 





















Switch-off Conditions 

The interior lighting is switched off under the following conditions: 

• Central locking in central arrest, all doors and the trunk lid are closed 

• Terminal R OFF after 16 mins 

• Interior lighting button pressed for longer than 3 s 

• Terminal R ON with doors closed 

• Terminal 58 ON and terminal R OFF 

The interior lighting is switched off if no door is opened within 20 s. 

• The interior lighting is switched off if the vehicle is unlocked via the remote 
control/identification transmitter and no door is opened after 20 s. 

• Terminal R OFF and a vehicle door is opened for longer than 1 min 

• "Power down" via diagnosis 

Electric Load Shutdown 

By way of terminal R OFF, the interior lighting system is switched off by the FRM after 16 
min. For this purpose, the Footwell Module sends the electric load shut-down informa¬ 
tion via the K-CAN. 

The Roof Functions Center (FZD) receives this information and switches off the interior 
lighting in the roof area. 

The interior lights that are switched on directly by the FRM are also switched off. 

Terminal 58g 

The FRM makes available terminal 58g via the K-CAN. Terminal 58g is pulse width- 
modulated and features the following two brightness levels: 

• The brightness level for the locator lighting can be set individually via the rocker 
switch on the column stalk. 

• The brightness level for the function lighting is not dimmed and is switched on 
at full brightness.

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 









Roof Functions Center (FZD) 

For the interior lighting system, the Roof Functions Center represents the interface to the 
Footwell Module since both control modules are connected to the K-CAN. For instance, 
the FZD can receive instructions to switch the interior lighting on or off via the K-CAN 
from the FRM. The FZD is the link to the rear interior lighting unit. 

The interior lighting functions in the Roof Functions Center are: 

• Switching the interior lighting on/off on request from the Footwell Module 

• Reading the signals from the interior light buttons and transferring them to the 
Footwell Module 

Terminal 58g 

The Roof Functions Center receives the terminal 58g signal from the Footwell Module via 
the K-CAN and activates the lighting in the buttons. 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The JBE is responsible for switching the luggage compartment and glove compartment 
lighting on and off by providing the ground connection for the lighting system. 

Luggage Compartment Lighting 

The status of the trunk lid contact changes when the trunk lid is opened manually or via 
the remote control/ID Transmitter, which causes the signal to go to a low level. The JBE 
evaluates this signal and switches on the luggage compartment lighting. 

The status of the trunk lid contact switch changes when the trunk lid is closed again, this 
causes the signal to go to a high level and the JBE switches off the luggage compart¬ 
ment lighting. 

The JBE also switches on the luggage compartment lighting when the trunk lid is 
opened from the inside by pressing the button on the A-pillar. 

Glove Compartment Lighting 

Opening the glove compartment operates a microswitch that switches on the glove com¬ 
partment lighting. 

Car Access System 2 (CAS2) 

The CAS2, serves as the master control module for the Central Locking System and 
issues the enable signal to activate/deactivate central locking which in turn transmits a 
signal, via K-CAN, to the FRM requesting the illumination of the interior light. 

As soon as the CAS2 receives a request to unlock/lock, the signal is checked whether it 
is valid and belongs to the vehicle. Only if the check is successful will the CAS2 forward 
the request to lock/unlock via JBE plus activate interior lighting via the FRM.

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 












































Car Access System 2 (CAS2) 

The car access system 2 is the master control module for opening and closing the win¬ 
dows. 

Footwell Module (FRM) 

The relays for the power window motors for the driver's and passenger's side are 
installed in the Footwell Module. 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The relays for the power window motors of the rear left/right doors are installed in the 
Junction Box Electronics Control Module. 

Opening & Closing 

The Car Access System 2 is the central control function for electric opening and closing 
of the power windows. This means that the CAS2 issues the signal to enable the open 
and close function for the power windows. The FRM and the JBE activate the power 
window motors. 

The FRM and the JBE monitor the motor speed of the respective power window motors. 
In this arrangement, the FRM or JBE can respond to overheating or possible blocking of 
the power window motors in the event of an object being trapped in the windows. 

Opening and Closing 

The corresponding power window motor is activated in OPEN or CLOSE direction by 
pressing or pulling the power window switches to the first notch position. The power 
window motor is driven until the corresponding power window switch is released. 

To ensure the power window is closed reliably, the power window motor is briefly driven 
to block status at the upper stop. 

Opening and Closing with Toll Function 

The toll function is implemented for all power windows (window regulators). The corre¬ 
sponding power window motor is driven in OPEN or CLOSE direction by pressing or 
pulling a power window switch beyond the limit stop. The power window motor moves 
the window automatically until it is completely open or closed. Power window operation 
is stopped when the power window switch is pressed or pulled again. 


68 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Examples: The following examples illustrate the interaction of the individual compo¬ 
nents for the power windows function. 

Switch Cluster, Driver's Door 

1. The signal is routed via the LIN-bus to the footwell module when the power window 
switch for the window in the driver's door or front passenger's door is operated. The 
footwell module drives the corresponding power window motor. 

2. The signal is routed from the driver's door switch cluster via the LIN-bus to the footwell 
module when the power window switches for the windows in the rear doors are operated. 
The FRM sends the signal via the K-CAN to the JBE. 

On receiving the signal, the Junction Box Electronics Control Module activates the corre¬ 
sponding power window motor. 

Power window switch, front passenger's door 

The signal is routed to the JBE when the power window switch in the front passenger's 
door is operated. The JBE sends the signal via the K-CAN to the footwell module. The 
FRM drives the power window motor. 

Power window switch, rear doors 

The signal is routed to the JBE when the power window switches in the rear doors are 
operated. The JBE drives the power window motor. 

By way of example, the opening and closing procedure for one of the rear windows is 
illustrated in the signal progression in the following graphic. The opening or closing func¬ 
tion is initiated from the driver's door switch cluster.

Convenient Opening and Closing 

Convenient opening or closing can be performed with the remote control/ID transmitter 
via the door lock in the driver's door or the outer driver's/ passenger's door handle. 

Convenient Opening with Remote Control 

The convenient opening function is initiated by unlocking the vehicle with the remote 
control and keeping the button pressed for longer than 5 s. 

Initially, the front windows are opened, followed after a short time delay by the rear win¬ 
dows and the slide/tilt sunroof. If the fold in/out outside mirrors are optionally installed and 
the mirrors are folded in, the mirrors will be folded out at the same time the rear windows 
are opened. 

The signal from the remote control is made available to the CAS2 via the remote control 
receiver. 

The CAS2 issues the enable to operate the power windows and initiates the convenient 
opening function. The footwell module and the Junction Box Electronics Control Module 
correspondingly activate the power window motors. 

Convenient Closing with Remote Control 

The convenient closing function is initiated after locking the vehicle with the remote con¬ 
trol and keeping the button pressed for longer than 5 s. Initially, the slide/tilt sunroof is 
closed followed with a short time delay by the rear/front windows. 

If the folding outside mirrors option is installed, the mirrors are folded in simultaneously as 
the rear windows are closed. 

Convenient Opening and Closing via the Driver's Door Lock Barrel 

There are two Hall sensors installed in the door lock for the purpose of opening and clos¬ 
ing the vehicle. The Hall sensors enable the FRM to detect the position of the mechani¬ 
cal key or of the spare key in the lock barrel. 

The key must be turned to the open or close position to initiate the convenient opening 
and closing function. The convenient opening or closing function is initiated when the 
key is held in this position. 

The FRM sends the request via the K-CAN. On conclusion of the corresponding check, 
the CAS2 initiates the convenient opening or closing procedure. 


70 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Convenient Closing with Comfort Access 

In connection with Comfort Access, the convenient closing function is triggered via the 
driver's/passenger's outer door handle. 

It is sufficient to touch the sensitive area of the outer door handle in order to trigger the 
convenient closing function via the door handle. Convenient closing starts if the sensitive 
area is touched for longer than 5 seconds. The identification transmitter must be within 
an approx. 2 m radius of the vehicle. 

Note: Touching the outer door handle corresponds to pressing the lock button 
on the ID transmitter. 


Indirect Anti-Trapping Protection 

Essentially, the indirect anti-trapping function does not prevent an object being trapped 
but rather it limits the trapping force to maximum 80 N. The power window motor is 
reversed on exceeding this trapping force. 

Thefootwell module and the Junction Box Electronics Control Module monitor the acti¬ 
vated power window motors. The indirect anti-trapping function of the front windows is 
activated by the footwell module. The indirect anti-trapping function of the rear windows 
is activated by the Junction Box Electronics Control Module. 

The indirect anti-trapping function in the E90 is based on the evaluation of the hall pulses 
from the power window motors. The speed is derived from the Hall pulses of the power 
window motors. Speed fluctuations within certain ranges trigger the indirect anti-trapping 
function so that the windows are opened. Operation of the power window switches if 
ineffective while the windows are opened. 

The window can only be operated in jolts if no operable anti-trapping function is detected 
as the result of defective Hall sensors. The power window (window regulator) is in emer¬ 
gency mode and must be reinitialized. 

Note: The initialization procedure is described in the Service Information. 


Panic Mode 

Panic mode is triggered by overpulling - releasing - overpulling (overpulling = pulling 
beyond limit stop) the power window switches. It is necessary to release and overpull the 
switch again in order to deactivate the anti-trapping protection function, which is still 
active the first time the switch is overpulled. 

Overpulling the power window switch the second time within 4 s closes the window with 
maximum force. 


Note: The indirect anti-trapping function is no longer active in this case. The 
window closes at the maximum closing force and does not reverse. 


71 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Load Shut-down, Terminal 50 

To protect the battery, operation of the power windows is interrupted during the vehicle 
start procedure. 

The CAS2 revokes the enable for power window operation, in order to interrupt current 
operation of the power windows. 

The signal is received by the FRM and JBE via the K-CAN. The power window switches 
must be pressed again following an interruption in operation. The corresponding function 
is not executed if the power windows are operated during the start procedure. 

The enable for operation of the power windows is not issued until the start procedure has 
been completed. 

Thermal Protection of Power Window Motors 

The FRM and the JBE monitor the power window motor temperature. The motor tem¬ 
perature is determined based on the outside temperature, motor running time and the 
time the motor is stationary (not operative). 

Each motor can be switched off individually to prevent the power window motors over¬ 
heating during operation of the power windows (window regulators). The motor is then 
deactivated for a defined period of time. 

The thermal protection function does not prevent the windows from being opened in the 
case of trapping. Once started, a power window function is not interrupted by the ther¬ 
mal protection facility. 

In panic mode the window can still be closed even when the thermal protection function 
is active.

Car Access System 2 (CAS2) 

The Car Access System 2 is the master control module for and issues the enable com¬ 
mand for opening and closing the sunroof. 

Footwell Module (FRM) 

The Footwell Module supplies input signals for the convenient opening/closing function 
and monitors the door contacts. 

Roof Function Center (FZD) 

The Roof Functions Center (FZD) controls and monitors the slide/tilt sunroof motor, plus 
it contains the relays to drive the sunroof motor. 

Comfort Access (CA) 

Comfort Access module (if installed) supplies input signals for the convenient 
opening/closing function. 

Operation 

The slide/tilt sunroof can be operated using the following controls: 

• Slide/tilt sunroof button 

• Remote control/identification transmitter 

• Driver's door lock barrel 

• Driver's/passenger's outer door handle with comfort access 

Slide/Tilt Sunroof Button 

The button for the slide/tilt sunroof is located in the roof functions center. When operated, 
the button sends a low signal to the electronic module that drives the sunroof motor cor¬ 
responding to the button selection. 

Remote Control/ID Transmitter 

The convenient opening/closing function is initiated by pressing the button on the remote 
control/identification transmitter. 

Driver's Door Lock Barrel 

The convenient opening/closing function is triggered by turning and holding the mechani¬ 
cal key or the spare key in the open/ close position in the driver's door lock barrel. 

Outer Door Handle 

The convenient closing function can be triggered by touching the sensitive area of the 
outer door handle. 


82 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Slide/tilt Sunroof Motor 

The FZD activates the integrated relays when it receives the request for the slide/tilt sun¬ 
roof. The sunroof motor receives its voltage supply via the relays. The FZD monitors the 
relay contacts to ensure trouble-free control of the motor and therefore of the slide/tilt 
sunroof. In addition, the motor speed is calculated from the pulses of the Hall sensors 
and the direction of rotation of the corresponding motor. 

The distance the slide/tilt sunroof must cover during the opening or closing procedure is 
defined in the FZD. The sunroof motor generates a certain number of pulses within this 
range and therefore recognizes the end positions of the slide/tilt sunroof. 

Anti-trapping Protection 

The indirect anti-trapping function is determined on the basis of the power intake of the 
sunroof motor. The anti-trapping function is triggered if the closing force increases by 80 
to 90 N and the sunroof is moved back by approx. 200 mm. 

Blocking Protection 

The FZD detects blocking if the pulses from the Hall sensor fail for more than 500 ms 
during the opening or closing procedure, which results in the power supply to the motor 
being switched off. 

Thermal Protection 

The thermal protection of the slide/tilt sunroof motor is calculated in the FZD. For this 
purpose there is a temperature sensor on the pc-board of the FZD which determines the 
ambient temperature. 

The FZD calculates the current motor temperature based on the operating time of the 
sunroof motor. The warm-up and cool-down phases are stored based on a temperature 
model in the FZD. The current temperature is entered in the memory before the FZD 
assumes sleep mode. When the vehicle is restarted, the motor temperature is adjusted 
to the ambient temperature. 

Panic Mode 

The slide/tilt sunroof is closed at maximum closing force in panic mode. Panic mode can 
be activated up to a vehicle speed of 16 km/h. Panic mode is triggered by pressing, 
releasing, again pressing and holding the sunroof button. 

The anti-trapping function is not active. 

Terminal 58g 

When the exterior lights are switched on, the FRM sends this information via the K-CAN. 
The FZD receives this information and adopts the set value for the instrument lighting. 

The LED in the button for the slide/tilt sunroof is activated, pulse width-modulated by the 
FZD. This achieves a constant brightness of the LED even under fluctuating system volt¬ 
age conditions. 


83 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Control 


Button for Slide/Tilt Sunroof 

The button is located in the FZD and has 3 operating directions. (Open/Close/Tip-up) 

Slide/Tilt Sunroof Motor 

The motor of the slide/tilt sunroof features 2 Hall sensors. The Hall sensors are located 
on the motor shaft and are offset by 90 degrees with respect to each other. 

When the motor is running, this results in two offset Hall signals that are used to register 
the direction of rotation of the motor and for the anti-trapping protection function. 

Initialization 


Initialization of the slide/tilt sunroof involves the following procedures that are necessary to 
ensure complete operation of the slide/tilt sunroof: 

• Normalizing 

The normalizing procedure involves finding the mechanical end position at the limit 
stop of the "tilt" position. This position is stored and is used to calculate the remain¬ 
ing end positions of the slide/tilt sunroof. 

• Learning the characteristic 

The learning procedure registers the closing force necessary for each direction of 
the slide/tilt sunroof and stores this value. 


Complete functionality of the slide/tilt sunroof can be guaranteed only by full initialization. 
The initialization procedure can be initiated with the button for the slide/tilt sunroof or via 
the diagnosis system. 


Procedure 

Note: The control button must remain pressed during the entire initialization 
procedure. The initialization procedure must be repeated if the button 
is released. 


Initialization is performed as follows: 

• Press and hold sunroof button in sunroof "tilt" direction 

• After approx. 15 s, the initialization run starts in the "tilt" 
direction and stores the end position 

• The slide/tilt sunroof is closed after 5 s in the "tilt" position 

• The sunroof is then opened and the end position stored 

• The sunroof is then closed and the end position stored 
Time required for initialization approx. 120 s. 

84 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Interruption in Power Supply 

An interruption in the power supply does not require renewed “normalization”. If the 


power supply is interrupted during initialization the entire procedure is invalid and the sys¬ 


tem must be re-initialized. 


Deleting the Initialization 

The initialization is deleted under the following circumstances: 

• Failure of the supply voltage during initialization 

• Hall sensor fault detected 

• Position implausible 

• Certain instructions in the diagnosis 

• Modified/changed vehicle coding 

• Coding data faulty

Anti-Theft Alarm System (DWA) 


The Anti-Theft Alarm System in the E90 monitors the armed status of the complete 
vehicle. The doors, hood, trunk lid, emergency current siren, vehicle interior and the 
DWA/K-Bus are monitored. The control/operation of this system is distributed among 
several different control modules.

DWA bus connections for the ultrasonic passenger compartment protection system are 
looped through the FZD, which supplies ground to the DWA LED. The signal from the 
ultrasonic passenger compartment protection system is looped through for the DWA 
LED. 

Ultrasonic Passenger Compartment Sensor (USIS) 

Ultrasonic Passenger Compartment Protection System has been adopted from the E65 
and adapted to the E90. The function of the anti-theft alarm system is integrated in the 
USIS. 


91 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 

























































Footwell Module (FRM) 

The Footwell Module monitors the door contacts for the anti-theft alarm system. In the 
event of a change in the status, the FRM sends this information via the K-CAN, thus 
allowing the USIS to trigger the alarm. 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The Junction Box Electronics Control Module monitors the trunk lid status in the central 
locking system. In the event of a change in the status, the JBE sends this information via 
the K-CAN, thus allowing the USIS to trigger the alarm. 

Car Access System 2 (CAS2) 

The Car Access System 2 monitors the status of the hood contact switch. If the hood 
contact switch sends a signal, the CAS2 sends the corresponding information via the 
K-CAN and the USIS triggers the alarm. 

Functions of the Anti-Theft Alarm System 

The anti-theft alarm system can be armed and disarmed at terminal 30. It is not possible 
to arm the anti-theft alarm system at terminal R or terminal 15. 

Arming the Anti-Theft Alarm System 

The anti-theft alarm system is armed from the driver's door lock barrel or by means of the 
remote control, together with the vehicle central arrest function. The following phases are 
implemented: 

• Directly after arming 

- Emergency current siren is armed and monitors its voltage supply 

- Anti-theft alarm system starts monitoring of the DWA bus 

- If the emergency current siren does not confirm the armed status, the DWA LED 
flashes to signal this status 

• 3 sec. after arming 

- Door contacts, trunk lid and hood contact switches are adopted in the alarm table 
3 sec. after they have signaled the "closed" status 

Faulty contacts are entered in the information memory and interpreted as closed 
but not adopted in the alarm table. They are not included in the evaluation for alarm 
triggering. 


92 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



• 3 sec. after arming or closing the last door, trunk lid or hood 

- Initialization of the tilt alarm sensor starts (current position of the vehicle is deter¬ 
mined and stored as a reference). 


- Initialization of the ultrasonic interior motion sensor is started. As part of the initial¬ 
ization procedure, an ultrasonic field is built up in the vehicle interior and compared 
to the reference models. The sensitivity is then set corresponding to the positions 
of the windows and sunroof. 


Note: Opening the trunk lid during the initialization interrupts the proce¬ 
dure. Initialization is restarted after closing the trunk lid. 

• 20 sec. after closing the hood, trunk lid or last door 

- Following its initialization, the ultrasonic interior sensor is adopted in the alarm 
table. 

• 30 sec. after closing the hood, trunk lid or last door 

- Following its initialization, the tilt alarm sensor is adopted in the alarm table. 

The tilt alarm sensor is masked out if no feedback telegram is received from it 
within 60 sec. after arming 

Deactivating Tilt Alarm & USIS 

It is advisable to deactivate the tilt alarm sensor and USIS in the following situations: 

• Vehicle on ship transport 

• Vehicle on car transporter 

• Persons or animals in vehicle 

Deactivation takes place by resetting the central arrest within 10 sec. after the central 
arrest or convenient closing function. Feedback is provided by the DWA LED lighting for 
2 seconds. 


Note: The tilt alarm sensor or ultrasonic passenger compartment sensor 
can be permanently deactivated by way of coding. 

Disarming the Anti-Theft Alarm System 

The anti-theft alarm system is disarmed by the "unlock" or "selective unlock" central 
locking functions. 

An audible and/or visual signal can be output in connection with disarming corresponding 
to the country-specific version. 

The DWA LED flashes for 5 min if an alarm was triggered during the time the anti-theft 
alarm system was armed. 

If the system is disarmed during the alarm, the action is not acknowledged but rather the 
alarm is terminated. 


93 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Unlocking the Luggage Compartment 

The tilt alarm sensor and USIS are blanked out if the luggage compartment is unlocked 
and opened on an armed vehicle since loading the vehicle could bring about a new vehi¬ 
cle status. The initialization procedure for the USIS and tilt alarm sensor is resumed 3 
sec after closing the trunk lid. 

Forced Disarming 

The anti-theft alarm system is disarmed when a person remains in the vehicle and sets 
the vehicle central arrest function via the remote control. 

The CAS2 recognizes the remote control if it is now inserted in its holder. The CAS2 
sends the "locked" message via the K-CAN and the Anti-theft alarm system is disarmed. 

No Crosswise Operation 

If crosswise operation is not implemented (coded - vehicle profile), an alarm is triggered 
when the anti-theft alarm system is armed or disarmed. This applies to arming with the 
remote control and disarming via the lock barrel in the driver's door. 

The CAS2 detects the unlock status via the driver's door lock barrel, however, it does not 
unlock the vehicle. The anti-theft alarm system remains armed and triggers the alarm 
when the driver's door is opened. 

This function is coded in the CAS2. 

Feedback from Anti-Theft Alarm System 

When arming, the anti-theft alarm system provides feedback only when all doors, hood 
and trunk lid are closed. 

Visual feedback is provided via the hazard warning lights or the DWA LED. 

Feedback via DWA LED 

For the vehicle user, the DWA LED serves as an indicator showing the status of the Anti¬ 
theft alarm system. 

When flashing, the DWA LED is driven at a frequency of 0.5 Hz and the ON-interval is 
60 ms. 


When blinking, the DWA LED is driven at a frequency of 2 Hz.

Comfort Access 

It is possible to place the remote control in the luggage compartment when the vehicle is 
locked and the luggage compartment open. Upon closing the luggage 
compartment,however the trunk lid is automatically opened again in order to avoid locking 
the remote control in the luggage compartment. In addition to automatically opening the 
trunk lid, the Anti-theft alarm system outputs an audible warning. The warning comprises 
a triple double-tone of the emergency current siren. 


95 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 
























Alarm Trigger 


Door Contact Signals 

The status of the door contacts is evaluated by the FRM and signaled to the USIS. The 
status of the individual door contacts is adopted in the alarm table 3 sec. after the status 
signal "door closed" is received by USIS. This means that an alarm can be triggered via a 
door that is already closed even if another door contact is still open. 

The FRM evaluates the Hall sensors and makes this information available via the K-CAN 
to other bus users. 

Trunk Lid 

The status of the trunk lid contact switch is evaluated by the JBE and signalled to the 
USIS. 

Initially, signals from the trunk lid contact switch, USIS are blanked out in the alarm table 
when the trunk lid is unlocked while the anti-theft alarm system is armed. The signals are 
also blanked out when the trunk lid is unlocked with the remote control with the anti-theft 
alarm system armed. The trunk lid contact switch is re-adopted in the alarm table 3 s 
after closing the trunk lid. The initialization procedure for the ultrasonic passenger com¬ 
partment sensor and tilt alarm sensor is started if another door or the trunk lid is no longer 
open. 

Hood 

The status of the hood contact switch is evaluated by the CAS2 and signalled to the 
USIS. The status of the hood contact switch is adopted in the alarm table 3 sec. after the 
"hood closed" status message. If not engaged, the CAS2 interprets the hood contact 
switch as closed. 

Note: A hood contact switch that was not coded correctly in the CAS 2 
produces an implausible signal. The implausible signal triggers a 
false alarm. 

Ultrasonic Passenger Compartment Sensor (USIS) 

The USIS senses and evaluated movements in the vehicle interior. The initialization 
procedure for the USIS is started 3 s after closing the hood, trunk lid and last door. 

The USIS is operational 20 s after initialization and is adopted in the alarm table. 


96 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Tilt Alarm Sensor 

The tilt alarm sensor registers the vehicle rest position when it is armed and detects 
changes in the position, e.g. jacking up the vehicle. The tilt alarm sensor is integrated in 
the emergency current siren. The initialization procedure for the tilt alarm sensor is start¬ 
ed 3 s after closing the last door and trunk lid. The tilt alarm sensor is operational 30 s 
after initialization and is adopted in the alarm table. 

If no feedback telegram is received from the emergency current siren or tilt alarm sensor, 
this status is entered in the information memory of the anti-theft alarm system. The tilt 
alarm sensor is not adopted in the alarm table. 

If the tilt alarm sensor detects vehicle movement, a corresponding signal is sent to the 
USIS. The anti-theft alarm system decides whether the movement is sufficient to trigger 
an alarm. 

To ensure a false alarm is not triggered as the result of the vehicle rocking, the angle val¬ 
ues for the longitudinal and transverse axis are determined every 90 ms. An alarm is trig¬ 
gered only if the vehicle remains in an inclined position for longer than approx. 1.5 s. 

The alarm triggered by the tilt alarm sensor is stored in the ultrasonic passenger compart¬ 
ment protection system. 

Self-Monitoring of Emergency Current Siren 

A self-monitoring facility that is activated immediately after the anti-theft alarm system 
has been armed is implemented in the emergency current siren. The emergency current 
siren monitors its own power supply and detects overvoltage, undervoltage and line break 
(open-circuit). 

If the emergency current siren detects a tampering attempt, it sends a corresponding sig¬ 
nal to the USIS, irrespective of whether the DWA bus is affected and triggers a stand¬ 
alone alarm. 

Line Monitoring - DWA Bus 

The ultrasonic passenger compartment protection system and the emergency current 
siren are connected via the DWA bus. Immediately after arming the anti-theft alarm sys¬ 
tem, the DWA bus is monitored cyclically every 2 s. 

The anti-theft alarm system sends a line monitoring request on the DWA bus to the 
emergency current siren. 

The emergency current siren must respond within 100 ms. If no reply is received, the 
request for line monitoring is sent a further two times. If still no response is received, the 
Anti-theft alarm system triggers an alarm. The line monitoring facility is also active while 
the alarm is triggered. 

The anti-theft alarm system measures the system voltage. To avoid false alarms, the line 
monitoring facility is switched off at a system voltage below 9 V. This avoids false alarms. 


97 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Alarm Output 

If an alarm criterion is fulfilled with the Anti-theft alarm system armed, the alarm is output 
(triggered) audibly and/or visually corresponding to the country-specific coding. 

Audible Alarm 

The emergency current siren receives a signal via the DWA bus when the anti-theft alarm 
system in the ultrasonic passenger compartment protection system triggers an alarm. 

The emergency current siren confirms receipt of the alarm request and triggers the audi¬ 
ble alarm. 

If the alarm request is not confirmed, the Anti-theft alarm system will repeat the alarm 
request up to eight times. 

Corresponding to the country-specific coding of the emergency current siren, an intermit¬ 
tent or interval tone is generated. The audible alarm is interrupted immediately and with¬ 
out feedback when the anti-theft alarm system is disarmed. 

Visual Alarm 

Depending on the country-specific version, the following components of the outer light¬ 
ing system can be activated for the visual alarm: 

• Direction indicator lights 

• Low beam headlight 

• High beam headlight 

When the anti-theft alarm system triggers an audible alarm, a visual alarm is simultane¬ 
ously triggered for 5 minutes. The anti-theft alarm systems sends the "flash" request via 
the K-CAN to the FRM. In turn, the FRM activates the components of the exterior light¬ 
ing system. The visual alarm cannot be extended by repeated alarm triggering. 

The visible alarm is terminated immediately and without feedback when the anti-theft 
alarm system is disarmed. 

Self- Contained/Integrated Alarm 

The emergency current cycle triggers the self contained/integrated alarm if its lines are 
tampered with. If the DWA bus is also cut through, the USIS detects this situation by the 
absence of the reply from the emergency current siren. In turn, USIS triggers the visual 
alarm.

Panic Mode 

Panic mode represents an option for the vehicle user to draw attention by triggering 
alarm, e.g. when under threat from the outside or in the event of an accident. 

Panic mode is initiated by pressing the trunk lid button on the remote control, the button 
must be pressed for longer than 2 s irrespective of whether the anti-theft alarm system is 
armed or not. 

The alarm is terminated by pressing any button on the remote control. Panic mode is not 
stored. 

If panic mode is initiated, the line is monitored during the entire duration. 

The anti-theft alarm system sends the alarm request and expects the reply from the 
emergency current siren. 

On completion of panic mode, the anti-theft alarm system assumes the setting that was 
selected prior to panic mode. 

Alarm Termination 

An alarm triggered for test purposes or inadvertently can be terminated by disarming the 
anti-theft alarm system or by inserting the remote control in its holder. The alarm is termi¬ 
nated immediately. No audible or visual feedback is output.

Electronic Steering Lock (ELV) 


The Electric Steering Wheel Lock (ELV) feature was first introduced on the E52 (Z8). 
Since its initial introduction the system has been revised and was recently introduced on 
the E87 (available in Europe) plus will be available with the E90 as well. The purpose of 
feature is to electrically lock and unlock the steering column. 

Advantages of the ELV 

• Remote control “Key” similar to that used on the E65, in the form of a "bitless" key 

• An electronic fault and a mechanical fault must occur simultaneously 

• No steering wheel lock mechanism in knee impact area 

• The E90 can also be equipped with the Comfort Access option

Car Access System 2 (CAS2) 

The CAS functions as the master controller and monitors the various driving or standstill 
situations of the vehicle, using speed sensor data, and is therefore also the control mod¬ 
ule that triggers/enables the unlocking (release) or locking action in the ELV. 


104 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 















































Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

The DSC module provides information pertaining to the wheel speed sensors to the 
CAS2 

(DSC via PT-CAN - JBE via K-CAN - CAS2 ) 

A redundant speed sensor signal is also provided directly to CAS2 by way of a direct con¬ 
nection from the DSC module to CAS2. 

Junction Box Electronics Control Module (JBE) 

The JBE is is the gateway module for transmitting the data from the DSC module to the 
CAS2. 

Electric Steering Lock (ELV) 

The ELV module is responsible for activating the mechanical components that lock and 
unlock the steering column. 

Operation of ELV 



Safety Concept 

A special safety concept is necessary in view of the special safety reguirements of the 
system. The safety concept must ensure that the steering cannot be locked while dri¬ 
ving. 

As the master control module, the CAS2 evaluates all input signals, checks them and 
issues the enable signal to the ELV control module for the lock and unlock functions. The 
control unit of the electric steering lock system is therefore the executing component in 
the safety concept. 

Electronic Function 

The CAS2 monitors the various driving or standstill situations of the vehicle (signal from 
DSC) and is also the control module that triggers/enables the unlocking or locking action 
by supplying power and ground to the ELV. CAS2 changes the polarity signal provided to 
the ELV depending if the steering is to be locked or unlocked. 

When CAS2 supplies a signal to the ELV a ground connection is applied first then power, 
the opposite occurs when the signal is removed. No power is applied to the ELV when 
the vehicle is not moving. 

105 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 


Unlocking the Steering 

The following procedure is necessary to unlock the steering: 

1. Detection of a valid remote control/ID transmitter 

2. Enable (release) of the unlock function 

3. Unlocking the steering 

4. Feedback 

5. Switching off ELV module 

Valid Remote Control 

On vehicles equipped with the CAS2, the remote control must be inserted in its holder in 
order to check whether the remote control is valid for this vehicle. 

Note: On vehicles equipped with the Comfort Access system, the ID transmitter 
must be located in the vehicle interior in order to check whether the ID 
transmitter is valid for this vehicle. 

Enable (release) of the Unlock Function 

The power supply for the ELV is switched on after successfully checking the electronic 
vehicle immobilizer and receiving start authorization. Based on the status of the Hall sen¬ 
sor, the ELV module checks whether the steering is locked or unlocked. The status is 
sent via the CAS/K-bus to the CAS2. 

The enable signal is issued after evaluating the following input signals: 

• Vehicle speed signal 

• Terminal status 

• Hall sensor ELV. 

Unlocking the Steering 

The ELV module starts the unlocking procedure and briefly activates the motor three 
times to move the lock pin in the unlock direction. The safety lever locks mechanically 
into the unlocked position to secure the unlocked steering column. 

The steering is now unlocked and successful completion of the unlock procedure is 
detected by the status of the Hall sensor. 

The steering wheel must be turned back and forth if this is not the case. The motor is 
again driven three times. 

A Hall sensor registers the end position of the secured lock pin. The ELV module evalu¬ 
ates the Hall sensor and stops motor operation. 


106 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Feedback 

The ELV module sends the "unlocked and secured" status to the CAS2, which stores 
the status of the ELV. 


Switching off the ELV control module 

The final item of information the CAS2 receives is the request to switch off the ELV. 

On receiving this request, the CAS2 switches off the power supply. 

Locking the Steering 

The following procedure is necessary to lock the steering: 

1. Lock request to the CAS2 

2. ELV module switched on 

3. Locking the steering 

4. Feedback 

5. Switching off ELV control module 

Lock Request 

The CAS2 initiates the steering locking procedure when the remote control 
is removed from its holder. 

The following conditions must apply in order to lock the steering: 

• Vehicle speed < 1 km/h. The CAS2 receives this signal directly and 
redundant via the K-CAN from the DSC module. 

• Terminal 15 OFF 

• ELV Hall sensor status 

• Remote control/ID transmitter removed from plug-in slot 

• Central locking secured (terminal 0). 

Note: In connection with the Comfort Access system, the lock function is 
initiated by detecting terminal 0. 

ELV Control Module Switched on 

The CAS2 switches on the ELV module. The Hall sensor of the electric steering lock is 
then checked along with the “lock” conditions. On successful completion of the check, 
the CAS2 issues the enable signal to lock the steering. 


107 

E90 General Vehicle Electrical 



Locking the Steering 

The ELV module activates a motor, which places a pretension on the “locking spring". 
The locking pin and safety lever are released so that the locking pin locks the steering. 
The ELV module detects the "locked and secured" position of the locking pin based on 
the Hall sensor. 

Feedback 

The ELV module detects the "locked and secured" position of the locking pin based on 
the Hall sensor. 

This status is sent to the CAS2 which stores the status of the ELV. 

Switching off the ELV control module 

The CAS2 receives the reguest to shut down with the last telegram from the ELV module.

ELV Mechanism 

A locking lever with its position monitored by a sensor and a locking pin are the main 
components of the mechanical part designed to lock or unlock the steering column at the 
correct moment. The entire internal kinematic structure is designed such that a mechani¬ 
cal lock (locking lever) keeps the unlocked locking pin in position when no power is 
applied to the ELV.

Locking Procedure 



From the "unlocked" position, the electric motor (7) begins to turn the gearwheel with 
controlled steps (3) and releases lock mechanism/lever. 

The drive carrier with worm gear (2) is blocked by the locking lever (8). The nut (6) now 
begins to rotate. 


Ill
