Introduction 


The BMW M family has been enhanced with the addition of the E70 M and E71 M. The 
BMW X5 M and X6 M were launched on to the US market in September of the 2009. 

The then BMW “Motorsport” was established in 1972 with the legendary Ml. For over 
30 years today’s BMW M GmbH has been developing BMW M vehicles with a motor- 
sport pedigree based on the standard production models. 

To date, the BMW 3 Series, Z Series, 5 Series and the 6 Series have been crowned with 
at least one M model. With the BMW X5 M and BMW X6 M, for the first time, X Series 
models will join this elite list of M performance vehicles. 

These models are the first M cars to be eguipped with the M TwinPower turbo engine 
and the M Sport automatic transmission as well as xDrive, Dynamic Performance 
Control, Dynamic Drive and run flat tires. 



5 

E70/E71 M Complete Vehicle 





















The X5 M and X6 M are the benchmark in terms of dynamics, agility and emotion in the 

High Performance Sports Activity Vehicle/Sports Activity Coupe class. 

Characteristic features of the E70/E71 M: 

• The overall body design concept of the series production vehicle was aerodynami- 
cally perfected to meet the M specific characteristics. 

• The engine and transmission combination delivers even more power and sponta¬ 
neous linear performance, with two engine dynamics control programs (power and 
economy). The M specific gearshift characteristics (without Drive Logic program) 
produce fast and precise gear changes. 

• Distinctly sporty engine sound, both in the lower and in the higher engine speed 
ranges. 

• The M Servotronic steering is taut, direct and precise. The M steering wheel with 
M shift paddles and M mode button are standard equipment. 

• The chassis and suspension where especially setup to develop a sporty stiff sus¬ 
pension but without excessively hard rolling characteristics, even in sport mode. 
The result is an optimized interaction of the steering, suspension and damping that 
enhances vehicle handling. 

• M Dynamic Mode (MDM) is installed instead of Dynamic Traction Control (DTC). 
Rear end-orientated xDrive setup is defaulted to when driving enthusiastically in 
MDM and DSC-OFF mode. 

• The M seats with high quality upholstery in BMW Merino leather offer optimum 
seat comfort. 

• BMW Merino leather, M instrument cluster, M drive menu, M head-up display, 

M seat, M specific trim strips, M foot rests and sill panel trim all add to the interior 
ergonomics of these vehicles. 

BMW Efficient Dynamics measures: 

• High Precision Injection (gasoline direct fuel injection). 

• Automatic transmission with optimized torque converter lockup clutch 
(Double- Damper) and increased efficiency by early up-shifting the transmission 
in the "Efficient" program. 

• Dynamic Drive (QMVH) with hydraulic supply system featuring controlled 
volumetric flow. 

• A/C compressor with magnetic clutch. 

• Fuel pump with requirement-orientated (PWM) control.

E70/E71 M - S63 engine 


Crankcase, Cylinder Head and Valve Timing Components 

The crankcase was taken from the N63. 

In view of the high ignition pressures of the S63, the pistons were upgraded accordingly. 

The interior structure of the crankcase ventilation system has been adapted in terms of 
the oil separator and control valve (similar to S85). 

Cylinder Head 

The cylinder head has been adapted to accommodate the higher thermal and mechani¬ 
cal loads, the modified turbochargers (ATL) and exhaust manifold as well as the increased 
transverse dynamics of the vehicle. 

The following changes have been made to the cylinder heads compared to the N63: 

• The S63 cylinder heads are made from a higher grade alloy 

• Adapted bolt pattern arrangement for the new exhaust manifold 

• The exhaust camshafts are new and specific to the S63 

Other changes to the top of the engine include the newly designed oil filler neck and its 
new location as well as the redesigned thermostat housing. 

Note: It is important to note that the rigidity of the engine mounts on the S63 
has been adapted to M specific requirements.

Exhaust System 


Exhaust Manifold 

On the N63, a single-flow, cast exhaust manifold per cylinder bank is assigned to each 
exhaust turbocharger (cyl. 1-4 and cyl. 5-8). 

The S63 is fitted with a four-flow, air gap insulated tuned pulse exhaust manifold that 
connects both cylinder banks. In an ideal configuration, the exhaust gas pulses from 
cylinders 1/6 and 4/7 are fed to the turbocharger installed over the right bank (cyl. 1 -4) 
and the exhaust gas pulses from cylinders 2/8 and 3/5 are fed to the turbocharger 
installed over the left bank (cyl. 5-8). 

This design creates a spacing of 360° of crankshaft angle between the two exhaust 
cycles within the exhaust flute that feeds each twin scroll turbocharger turbine. The effec¬ 
tive utilization of the exhaust gas energy delivers optimum de-throttling, ideal response 
characteristics and minimizes turbo lag. 

Corrugated pipes combined with sliding seat flanges connect the exhaust ports from 
both banks within the center of the manifold outer shell to compensate for thermo¬ 
mechanical expansion and contraction. (See below)

E70/E71 M Complete Vehicle 















The specially designed exhaust manifold connects each of the 8 cylinders in sequence 
according to the exhaust pulses in the firing order. This delivers a uniform flow of exhaust 
gas to the turbochargers which improves volumetric efficiency by promoting cylinder 
scavenging. 

Every 180° of crankshaft rotation, one exhaust gas pulse is fed to each turbocharger over 
the entire ignition sequence (1-5-4-8-6-3-7-2). 

This highly efficient charging concept achieves optimum energy transmission of the 
exhaust flow to the turbine blades of the turbochargers. The result is the fastest and 
most direct response characteristics of any turbo engine worldwide. The innovative 
technology is patented by BMW and therefore represents a unique selling point over 
the competition.

Advantages of the Twin-scroll Turbo System 

The response characteristics of the exhaust turbochargers are enhanced when compared 
to the N63. The S63 turbocharger turbines are fed through two separate channels within 
the turbine housing (highlighted red in the graphic above). Each of these channels or 
“scrolls” is always fed by the exhaust pulses from the same two cylinders. 

The layout and cross sections of the turbine impeller and compressor wheels have been 
correspondingly adapted and are designed for the maximum exhaust inlet operating tem¬ 
perature of 1020° C (1868° F). 

The diverter valves are now integrated in the charge air line and have a hose connection 
to the turbocharger compressor inlet side (See the graphic on the next page). 

Catalytic converters and oxygen sensors are the same as in the N63 with the cable rout¬ 
ing of the oxygen sensors adapted accordingly to the new engine.

Exhaust Components After Catalytic Converter "Cold End" 

The exhaust system downstream of the catalytic converter in the E7x M is based on the 
exhaust system of the E71 xDrive 50i and adapted to the requirements of the S63 
engine. 

Particular attention was paid to ensuring optimum pipe layout routing using the largest 
possible pipe diameter. 

The four M tail pipes with chrome tips round off the dynamic and sporty appearance of 
the vehicles.

Air Intake System 


Intake Silencer (AGD) 

To enhance airflow to the engine while taking 
pedestrian protection into consideration, the 
intake silencer has been redesigned and fixed 
to the body directly in front of the engine (on 
N63 its fixed to the engine). 

Two activated carbon filters prevent pollutants 
(that could stem from the engine) from enter¬ 
ing the intake system when the engine is not 
in operation, complying with corresponding 
emission requirements. 

US models use an intake silencer with an 
integrated snow valve and additional activated 
carbon filter mesh. 



Snow Valve 

The snow valve is a filter bypass valve that is opened by engine vacuum. It allows contin¬ 
ued engine operation (at greatly reduced power output) if necessary, should the air clean¬ 
er be iced up or closed off with packed snow in extreme wheather conditions. 



Vacuum Supply 

The vacuum pump has been adopted from the N63. The two plastic vacuum accumula¬ 
tors each with a volume of 0.3 I are new and are located under the engine cover (N63 
uses one accumulator designed as a metal cylinder under the turbochargers). 


26 

E70/E71 M Complete Vehicle 







Cooling Systems 


As in the series production X6 (xDrive50i) the X5/X6 M have two cooling systems, the 
main engine cooling system and a low temperature cooling system dedicated to intake 
charge air cooling (turbo intercooling). 

The following components have been adopted from the N63 and are common with 
series production E71 vehicles: 

• The low temperature system heat exchanger for the intercoolers 

• Air conditioning condenser 

• Power steering oil cooler 

• The standalone auxiliary radiator 

The expansion tank for the main engine cooling system was taken from the E70. 

New and Adapted Cooling Components 

The main coolant radiator takes up the same package space as in the E71 but has a 
winglet tubing design, for increased surface area. It no longer contains the integrated low 
temperature area for the transmission oil-to-coolant heat exchanger. 

The engine oil cooler has been adapted to the higher engine output by increasing the 
core depth from 30 mm to 45 mm. 

The charge air (low temperature) cooling system has an additional intercooler heat 
exchanger installed in series, a second auxiliary water pump and a new expansion tank. 
The length of the engine intercoolers (LLK) has been increased from 130 mm to 160 
mm. The measuring range of the boost pressure sensors at the intercooler outlet has also 
increased to 4 bar. 

The transmission oil heat exchanger has been adapted to the higher engine output by 
increasing the number of plates from 23 to 31.

Transmission 


With the M Sport automatic transmission 6HP26S the customer is able to enjoy sponta¬ 
neous gearshifts and a more stable control of the torque converter lock-up clutch. 

To effectively absorb rotational irregularities in the drive train and achieve the best possi¬ 
ble reduction of the slip at the converter lock-up clutch, a double-damper torque convert¬ 
er is installed. A single-damper torque converter design is used in the 6HP26TU of the 
E71 xDrive50i. 

The spring characteristics in the double-damper converter are especially designed for the 
increased power and torque of the S63 engine. The 6HP26S internal components have 
also been adapted to the maximum engine speed of 6800 rpm. 

The plastic transmission oil pan has been replaced with an aluminum version. The airflow 
to the transmission has been enhanced and the opening point of the transmission oil 
thermostat has been lowered. 

The gear ratio is identical to that of the series production 6HP26TU transmission.

M Gear Selector Lever (M GWS) 

The functional design of the M gear selector lever is similar to the series production E7x. 
A new feature of the design is the integrated M logo in the gear indicator of the M gear 
selector lever. 


The button for the electronic damper control (standard equipment feature) is positioned 
on the base of the gear selector lever. 



E70/E71 M gear selector lever 


Transmission Control 

The electronic transmission control unit (EGS) for the 6HP26S, is integrated into the 
transmission case as on the series production model. 

The transmission control software is adapted to M specific requirements. 

The transmission now features even shorter shift times in manual mode, ensured by a 
new type of torque reduction system involving cylinder cutout. This feature along with 
the short axle transmission ratio emphasize the sporty characteristics of the vehicle. 

A special M shifting program ensures quick and precise gearchanges and enhances 
throttle response throughout the three driving modes.

Note : The weight of the transmission has increased slightly as the result of the 
converter technology used. 

Launch Control 

Launch control ensures optimum vehicle acceleration when starting on a road surface 
with sufficient grip. 

Activation is not possible if one of the preconditioning requirements is not met and if the 
transmission oil temperature is too high. (See Owner’s Manual) 

The alternator power output is reduced to zero when launch control is activated, in order 
to further optimize power. However the A/C compressor remains active to address possi¬ 
ble window fogging. 

Note: For further information regarding E70/E71 M Launch Control refer to the 
vehicle Owner’s Manual. 

Transfer Case and Final Drive 

The xDrive transfer case and input/output shaft have been adopted from the series pro¬ 
duction models. The rigidity of the rubber mounts in the transmission mounting has been 
adapted to the application.

Chassis and Suspension 


The vehicle isl Omm lower with stiffer suspension settings and M specific rear air 
springs. The damper setup was especially adapted to the increased structural stiffness 
of the chassis.

Front Axle 

Springs and Struts 

Front springs are series production E71 with EDC. Shock absorbers are also E71 N63 
with EDC but with piston rods adapted to the newly designed strut mounts. Damper 
hardness and characteristic were specially adapted to M requirements and suspension 
setup. 

Links, Struts and Wheel Bearing Assemblies 

The rigidity of the upper control arm has been enhanced as well as the wheel bearing 
assembly with the use of a reinforced outer bearing race. 


33 

E70/E71 M Complete Vehicle 






Steering 

The M rack and pinion power steering is equipped as standard with Servotronic. It has 
an overall steering ratio of 19.5:1 and 3.11 turns from lock to lock is equal to the standard 
E7x series production vehicle. 

The power steering pump of the E70 M is equipped with the proportional valve for elec¬ 
tronic volumetric flow adjustment (EVV valve). The EW valve and the Servotronic valve 
are controlled directly by the ICM control unit. 

Note: The oil pressure in the power steering system is minimized correspond¬ 
ing to the situation (e.g. driving straight ahead) by means of the EW 
valve. This feature is already known from the E71 and F01 as part of C02 
reduction measures. 

Rear Axle 

The rubber mounts between the body and rear axle carrier are adapted in terms of their 
rigidity to M specific requirements. 

Springs and Struts 

New strut mounts with specially adapted internal rubber section are installed. The air 
springs are new and have been adapted to the strut mount, lower vehicle height and M 
specific tuning. The air springs are based on the E71 N63 EDC but with layout for M 
suspension setup. The shock absorbers are also based on the E71 N63 EDC, with the 
piston rod adapted to the new strut mount. Damper hardness and characteristic were 
especially adapted to M requirements. 

Links, Struts and Wheel Bearing Assemblies 

The rigidity of the pivot link, control arm and trailing arm has been correspondingly 
enhanced. All links and wheel bearings have been adopted from the series production 
E71. 

Brakes 

The brake master cylinder has undergone slight modification to enable even sportier 
response. The front and rear brakes have been enlarged compared to the current series 
production X5 and X6. 

Directional (0 395 mm/15.56”) lightweight brake rotors are fitted in the front (Geomet®- 
coated cast iron friction surface on aluminum center hubs) with new four piston aluminum 
mono block fixed callipers, painted black. The brake guard plates on the front axle have 
been adapted to the larger brakes. 

The rear brakes rotors are of the same design as the front (cast iron with aluminum center 
hubs). They are 0 385 x 24mm/15.2 x 0.9” and use floating calipers adopted from the X6 
xDrive50i. 

Note: The Geomet® coating of the rotors provides corrosion protection.

Dynamic Driving Systems 

With the E70/E71 M, the handling characteristics of M vehicles are introduced for the first 
time to the High Performance Sports Activity Vehicle/Sports Activity Coupe class. 

Vehicle dynamics management (VDC and Dynamic Drive) and Integrated Chassis 
Management (Dynamic Performance Control and Servotronic) are installed as standard. 

This makes the E70 M the first BMWX5 with Integrated Chassis Management and 
Dynamic Performance Control. 

Although Active Steering is not offered, both vehicles feature M rack and pinion power 
steering systems with Servotronic. 

The M specific driving dynamics (longitudinal, transverse and vertical) were tuned on the 
North loop of the Nurburgring race track with the main focus on handling and lap times. 

Vertical Dynamics Management 

Vertical dynamics control (VDC) and active roll stabilization (ARS) have been functionally 
combined to create vertical dynamics management. This was first introduced in the E70 
with the marketing designation Adaptive Drive. 

The VDC function integrated in the vertical dynamics management control unit (VDM) 
controls the adjustable dampers. As an expansion to the EDC-K system, the transverse 
acceleration is now included as an input signal together with the ride height, longitudinal 
and vertical acceleration. The VDM control unit coordinates the functions between the 
VDC and ARS, i.e. between damper and stabilizer bar control. 

As a C02 reduction measure when driving in a straight line, the fluid flow rate of the ARS 
radial piston pump is restricted by the intake restrictor valve on the intake side of the cir¬ 
cuit, thereby substantially reducing the circulation pressure and, therefore, the engine 
power used to drive the pump. The VDM operates the intake restrictor valve lowering 
ARS system pressure when ARS is not needed. 

Adaptive Drive is installed as standard in the E70 M and E71 M. The integration of these 
systems in connection with M specific tuning ensures a maximum in terms of dynamics, 
comfort and safety in this vehicle class. The agility of the vehicle has been optimized 
while taking long distance driving suitability into consideration. 

Vehicle handling can be enhanced for dynamic driving with the EDC button on the gear 
selector lever and the DSC button on the center console. Both button functions can also 
be preconfigured in the M Drive menu and selected by means of the M button on the 
steering wheel. 


37 

E70/E71 M Complete Vehicle 



EDC Button Selection Option 

The EDC on the current M3, M5 and M6 models has three selection options "Comfort", 
"Normal" and "Sport" where no dynamic control takes place in the "Sport" selection but 
rather only the dampers are set extremely hard (ideal for slalom). 

E70 M and E71 M feature two selection options, "Normal" and "Sport", where dynamic 
control also takes place in "Sport". 

■ EDC Normal 

Although the E70/E71 M offer a distinct increase in driving dynamics compared to the 
respective series production model. EDC and Servotronic have normal characteristics in 
this setting. This mode offers a balanced setup that combines M characteristic dynamic 
driving potential with comfort. 

EDC Sport 

In this mode, the suspension offers the maximum suspension stiffness and higher steer¬ 
ing torque to deliver even greater dynamic driving performance. A sportier Servotronic 
characteristic ensures optimum steering feedback. 

Transverse Dynamics Management 

The Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) represents the system network for controlling 
transverse dynamics. 

This control unit coordinates the interaction between Servotronic, Dynamic Performance 
Control and DSC. 

Dynamic Performance Control 

The function of the torque vectoring final 
drive unit (Dynamic Performance Control) 
was first introduced in the E71 and is coordi¬ 
nated by the ICM control unit while the actu¬ 
ators of the Dynamic Performance Control 
are controlled by the QMVH (transverse 
torque distribution control unit for the rear 
axle). 

The main differences of the E70/ E71 M compared to the series production E71 include 
the adaptation of the dynamic driving parameters as well as additional cooling measures. 

The Dynamic Performance Control function can now be displayed on the CID. The cur¬ 
rent drive torque distribution applied by the Dynamic Performance Control and xDrive is 
approximately represented by arrows at all four wheels. (See graphic) 

M specific conventional rack and pinion steering gear with Servotronic is fitted on the 
E70/E71M. The Servotronic valve is controlled by the ICM. Active Steering is not avail¬ 
able on either of these vehicles. 



38 

E70/E71 M Complete Vehicle 











Longitudinal Dynamics Management 

Longitudinal dynamics management is a feature of the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). 
By sending information to the transfer case control unit (VTG), the DSC controls the 
power distribution between the front and rear axles. Based on information sent to the 
ICM, the transverse torque distribution at the rear axle is additionally influenced under 
unstable vehicle conditions. 

The xDrive all-wheel drive system provides permanently variable torque distribution 
between the front and rear axle. 

To increase driving dynamics, on the E70/E71 M more torque has been sent to the rear 
wheels. The transferred drive torque to the front axle is less and distinctly delayed when 
compared to the E70 and E71, especially in M Dynamic and DSC OFF mode. 

The understeer tendency of the all-wheel drive is greatly reduced especially while driving 
out of corners. This means that power can be applied earlier and higher speeds can be 
achieved. 

M Dynamic Mode (MDM) and DSC OFF Mode 

In M Dynamic mode (MDM), the typical self-steering M vehicle characteristic response is 
achieved by: 

• the extended control thresholds for brake intervention, 

• the distinctly later engine power reduction by ASC and 

• the rear end emphasized xDrive setup together with Dynamic Performance Control. 

Even at full power at the apex of a bend, the E70 M and E71 M follow the steering line 
and the vehicles can be steered with the accelerator pedal. 

Maximum cornering speeds can be achieved in active MDM mode while retaining driving 
safety. The setup of the xDrive and Dynamic Performance Control is correspondingly 
adapted in this mode. Brake interventions only take place in extreme driving situations in 
connection with high transverse acceleration. Engine power output is not reduced as the 
result of wheel slip. 

It is possible to change between DSC ON, MDM and DSC OFF by means of the DSC 
button or the configuration in the M Drive menu. 

With DSC OFF a check control message will be displayed on the instrument panel and 
on the HUD. In this case MDM and DSC are simultaneously deactivated thus the stabiliz¬ 
ing interventions are now not carried out. (See Vehicle Owner’s Manual for more infor¬ 
mation.) 


CAUTION!!! 


To maintain vehicle stability drive with DSC switched ON 
and M Dynamic Mode switched OFF whenever possible.

E70/E71 M Complete Vehicle 





















































The following differences between the electrical systems of the series production 
E7x vehicles compared to the E70/E71 M must be noted: 

PT-CAN: 

The S63 is exclusively equipped with the DME MSD85.1. 

The control unit for active steering (AL) has been dropped as active steering is not 
offered for the E70/E71 M vehicles. However all other control units (DSC, ICM, QMVH, 
VDM and ARS) are installed because E70 M and E71 M are equipped with Adaptive 
Drive, Dynamic Performance Control and Integrated Electronic Height Control as stan¬ 
dard equipment. 

K-CAN: 

The PDC function has been integrated in the junction box as on F01. 

The control unit for the optional auxiliary heating control for the 3rd row of seats (ZHS3R) 
has been dropped as this option is not offered for the E70 M. 

TRSVC top rear side view camera (option) is installed for the first time on US E7x vehicles 

MOST: 

As from10/09 the CIC is also installed in the series production E70 and E71 vehicles and 
there is no difference in the vehicle electrical system of the E70/E71 M vehicles com¬ 
pared to the series production E71 models. 

CIC Basic uses a smaller screen and refers to the CIC option without Navigation 

The functions of the CCC/MASK/CHAMFJ IBOC, SDARS are all integrated in the CIC. 
These control units are therefore no longer installed in the vehicle.

Car Information Computer (CIC) 

The Car Information Computer was introduced in the BMW 1 Series and 3 Series during 
the second half of 2008. All other model series then followed except for the E7x models. 
As part of the 10/2009 model year updates the CIC is now also offered on E7x vehicles. 

The E70/E71 M are the first X models to be launched with the Car Information Computer 
(CIC) including the M Drive menu. The CIC represents a consistent progression of the 
route laid down by the Car Communication Computer (CCC). 

The main feature of the iDrive operating concept is the newly designed controller which 
now features short cut buttons. In addition, the complete layout of the user interface has 
been changed. Compared to the CCC, the number of drives in the CIC has been 
reduced to one DVD player.

The navigation system of the CIC has been enhanced with many additional functions. 
Examples include full screen mode, night view and the 3D models in the perspective map 
view. This was realized by means of a hard disk that is capable of storing map data. 
Formerly, the map data had to be read separately from a DVD for each destination entry. 

The hard disk in the CIC also makes it possible to create a play list for music data and a 
music track database (Gracenote®) to facilitate searching for music. A USB connection is 
provided and located in the glove compartment to import and export/back up data. 

Several external receivers (e.g. IBOC, SDARS) and their functions have been realized in 
the CIC either by way of hardware or software, thus greatly expanding its functionality. 

An address database has been created in the "Contacts" submenu which can be 
accessed also from the telephone and navigation menu. 

This innovation offers a wide range of options for future models. The communication 
service BMW Assist has been adapted to the new layout of the user interface and many 
additional services have been added (e.g. BMW Search and My Info [Google send to 
car]). The voice recognition system has been further developed to ensure voice input 
takes place even more smoothly. 

The innovations introduced to the CIC system at the launch of the E7x models are listed 
in the following pages. 

Note: For more information refer to the (CIC) Car Information Computer training 
material or the F01 Audio Systems training material available on TIS and 
ICR

New Features 


Satellite Radio 

With the introduction of the E70/E71 M to the US market in September of 2009, the 
hardware for the satellite tuner is integrated in the CIC. This newest version of CIC is as 
of now also installed in series production E7X vehicles. The satellite tuner in this CIC is 
refered to as In-Box SDARS and it allows the customer to activate the function with a 
valid enable code. 

A new icon bar for the SDARS system provides additional functions: 

• List view (select artists, title or channel) 

• Categories of different genres 

• Direct tuning of individual channels (e.g. Channel 6) 

• Time shift (current program is buffered) 

• Favorites storage 

• Traffic jump (traffic information for a preferred region) 


Change Between Different List Views 

With this icon, it is possible to switch among all the available views 
of Satellite Radio (Long Channel Name, Artist and Song Title).

With the skip buttons of the steering wheel or the skip buttons next to CD slot, it is possi¬ 
ble to skip to the next/previous subscribed channel in the current category. If a skip is 
issued at the end or beginning of a list, a wrap around in the active category in either 
direction must take place. 


Note: If instant replay is active (visible in status bar), no new channel is tuned, 
but the previous or next track in the replay buffer will be played when the 
skip button is pressed. 

Complete Channel Information 

There exists the possibility to display all the details or PDT information (program descrip¬ 
tive text information) of the currently tuned channel under the options menu. This func¬ 
tion is useful, if the channel information is too long (it contains an URL or phone number, 
etc.) for the channel info in the list view.

Time Shift 


The SIRIUS module allows to record approximately one hour of the current 
audio stream in a ring buffer. The recording time depends on the audio 
quality of the channel. The buffer will even be filled, if another audio source 
is active, but it is erased every time a new SDARS channel is tuned. The 
instant replay interface allows jumping in the buffer similar to CD playback 
(forward, rewind, skip song- and time-wise). Every time the audio does not reflect the live 
signal, an icon is displayed in the status bar and the current signal status is taken away. 



Select the time shift icon in the toolbar to enter the instant replay menu.

Notable features of this function are: 

• Skip buttons on steering wheel and the ones next to CD slot are used to skip to 
next or previous track in buffer. 

• The status bar shows "Time shift", current time and the active channel. 

• The artist and title of the played song must be shown. 

• If live signal is played, signal status bar next to artist/title and the word "live" next to 
the buffer bar must be shown. 

• The “Buffer Fill” pointer and current replay position (red arrow) define the offset to 
live signal. This offset is reported in hours, minutes and seconds. If playback is 
paused, this offset increases. 

• If offset is zero, live signal is heard. 

• If signal is lost the active channel is displayed and played as long as the buffer is 
filled. If offset is zero and signal is not available, "Acquiring" is displayed in status bar. 

• If the buffer is full, the first track at the beginning of the buffer will be deleted. 


Automatic Time Shift 



If Automatic time shift is activated, the time shift status will change to 
pause, if the Source Activity status is paused. This happens if the enter¬ 
tainment button is pressed (mute) or if an incoming phone call is accepted. 


Note: This function is available starting in 03/2010.
