Crash Sensitive Head Restraints 



Introduction 


The crash sensitive head restraints will be fitted in the following vehicles as of 09/07: 

• E60 

• E61 

• E63 

• E64 

• E83 

• E70 (from 10/07) 

The crash sensitive head restraint will replace the active head restraint on the luxury seat 
(multifunction seat). 

Why crash sensitive head restraints? 

The crash sensitive head restraints reduce the stresses on the spinal column in the neck 
area in the event of an impact from the rear. 

For the vehicle occupants, correct adjustment of the head restraints and the distance 
between the head and the head restraint of decisive importance. Depending on the seat 
position and design, the distance between head and head restraint can be as much as 
100 mm. 

The crash sensitive head restraints have primarily been designed for rear impacts at 
moderate speeds, e.g. in urban traffic. Even in urban traffic conditions, injuries to the cer¬ 
vical vertebral column can occur with a conventional head restraint. 

In the event of a rear impact, the front section of the head restraint is moved up to 60 
mm forward by spring action within a split second. 

Even before the head is thrown backwards by the force of the rear impact, the crash sen¬ 
sitive head restraint has already shortened the distance between it and the head. 

The shorter distance helps to increase the stabilizing and restraining function of the head 
restraint. As a result, injuries to the neck and cervical vertebral column can be reduced or 
even entirely prevented. 

Note: Car manufacturers, magazines, insurance companies, motoring organi¬ 
zations, etc. regularly test head restraints. The BMW crash sensitive 
head restraints make a significant contribution to increasing car occu¬ 
pant safety. In future tests, the crash sensitive head restraints will have 
a positive effect on the overall safety rating of the vehicle.

The new head restraints are easy to identify. On the multifunction seat, the head restraint 
side panels now extend over the entire head restraint cushion. All other seats have a but¬ 
ton on the side of the head restraint for adjusting the head restraint reach.

Head Restraint Bar 


The head restraint bar forms the physical connection to the seat. The head restraint bar 
has ratchet grooves to allow for height adjustment. 

To protect the pyrotechnic actuator connecting lead, there is a catch that prevents the 
head restraint being withdrawn beyond the maximum height position. This means that the 
head restraint can not be removed from the seat. 

Similarly, head restraints with power adjustment can not be removed from the seat. 

Head Restraint Frame 

The head restraint frame is attached to the head restraint bar. The head restraint frame 
houses the entire head restraint mechanism. 

That includes the pyrotechnic actuator, the release mechanism and the actuating springs 
for the impact plate. 

Pyrotechnic Actuator 

The pyrotechnic actuator contains a detonator pellet. 

As soon as the detonator pellet receives the detonation signal, the propellant is ignited. 

The propellant deploys the release pin. The release pin pushes the release plate down¬ 
wards, thereby releasing the actuating springs so that they push the impact plate and 
head restraint cushion forwards and upwards. 

The pyrotechnic actuator contains a resistor that artificially keeps the signal at high after 
the head restraint has been deployed. 

The Check Control message is generated by the safety systems control unit. 

The signal for the Check Control message is transmitted via the vehicle's bus system to 
the instrument cluster. The instrument cluster displays the Check Control message. The 
Central Information Display may also display a complementary message.

Spring Actuating Mechanism 

The actuating springs are held under tension by the release plate. As soon as the release 
plate releases the spring mechanism, the force of the springs comes into action. The 
actuating springs then push the impact plate and head restraint cushion forwards and 
upwards. 

Button for Head Restraint Adjustment 

The button releases the catches on the left and right of the head restraint frame by 
means of a linkage. This allows the head restraint cushion to be pushed backwards to 
adjust the head restraint reach.

Principles of Operation 


In order to obtain the best possible comfort, the front part of the head restraint can be 
moved forwards or backwards by approximately 30 mm. There are two self-locating 
extended positions. That means that altogether there are three different settings for 
head restraint reach. 

To move the front part of the head restraint forwards, it simply has to be pulled forwards 
until it snaps into one of the two locating positions. 

To move it back, the button on the side of the crash sensitive head restraint has to be 
pressed. This releases the catch and the front part of the head restraint can be moved 
back.

Deployment in the Event of a Rear Impact 

The vehicle's safety electronics detect the occurrence of a rear-end impact by means of 
sensors. If the vehicle (the BMW suffering the impact) reaches a certain velocity differen¬ 
tial within a specified period of time, the crash sensitive head restraints are deployed. 

This can occur even with a relatively light rear impact. 

That means that the crash sensitive head restraints can be deployed even with a relative¬ 
ly light rear impact. 

If the safety electronics detect a major rear impact, other safety eguipment such as seat- 
belt tensioners or the safety battery terminal may also be deployed.

Head restraint mechanism 


The vehicle's sensor systems control unit initiates deployment of the crash sensitive head 
restraints. To do so, the control unit transmits the detonation signal for the detonator pel¬ 
let in the head restraint's pyrotechnic actuator. 

The pyrotechnic actuator releases head restraint actuation mechanism by operating the 
release plate. The front section of the head restraint is then free to move forwards under 
the force of the springs. 

The maximum forward travel of the head restraint cushion is 60 mm; the cushion is also 
raised by up to 40 mm at the same time.

If the front part of the head restraint is pushed backwards after it has deployed, it does not 
stay in that position but is pushed forwards again by the springs. It will not lock back into 
the undeployed position until the pyrotechnic actuator has been replaced. 

Note: If the crash sensitive head restraint has been deployed, the pyrotechnic 
actuator must be replaced by a BMW dealer. It is essential to follow the 
repair instructions.

Electrical Connection 

The head restraint is connected to the safety system control unit by a two-core cable. 

Therefore, the head restraint has a catch which prevents it being raised beyond its high¬ 
est adjustment position and removed from the seat. 

The safety system control unit on the E60, E61, E63 and E64 is the ACSM (Advanced 
Crash and Safety Management). 

The control unit for the safety system on the E83 is the MRS (Multiple Restraint System) 
control unit.

Head Restraint Versions 

Two versions of the head restraint are fitted. 

One version is for all seats other than the luxury seat (multifunction seat). The luxury seat 
has a special version of its own. The luxury seat has adjustable side supports on the head 
restraint. The side supports on the crash sensitive head restraint now extend across the 
whole of the head restraint contact area.

Service Information 


Replacing the Pyrotechnic Actuator 

If the crash sensitive head restraint has been deployed, the pyrotechnic actuator must be 
replaced by a BMW dealer. After replacing the pyrotechnic actuator, clear the fault mem¬ 
ory. It is essential to follow the repair instructions. 

Replacement of the pyrotechnic actuator does not require an explosives certificate in 
Germany. 

The pyrotechnic actuator has been exempted from the explosives certificate requirement 
by the German Federal Materials Testing Office. 

Check Control Message 

After the crash sensitive head restraint has been deployed, the instrument cluster dis¬ 
plays a CC message. The Central Information Display also displays complementary 
information at the same time.

Head Rest Retaining Catch 

The head restraint is connected to the safety system control unit by a two-core cable. 

Therefore there are spring clips fitted that prevent the head restraint from being com¬ 
pletely withdrawn. 

To remove the head restraint, the rear panel of the seat backrest has to be removed. 


All Non-multifunction Seats 

One of the head restraint bars has a locating notch 
about two thirds of the way down. A spring clip 
engages in that notch. The spring clip is inside the 
seat backrest on the head restraint guide sleeve. 

When the spring clip is released the head restraint can 
be fully withdrawn from the seat backrest. In order to 
release the spring clip and disconnect the pyrotechnic 
actuator connector, the rear panel of the seat backrest 
has to be removed. 

Multifunction Seats 

On each head restraint bar end there is a locating 
groove. There is a spring clip in each one. 

Both spring clips have to be released. The head 
restraint can then be completely withdrawn from the 
seat backrest. In order to release the spring clip and 
disconnect the pyrotechnic actuator connector, the 
rear panel of the seat backrest has to be removed.
