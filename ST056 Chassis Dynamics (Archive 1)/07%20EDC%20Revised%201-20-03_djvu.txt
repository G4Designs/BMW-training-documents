Electronic Dampening Control 




Purpose of the System 

The EDC III is a fully automatic adjusting damper control system available on the E31, E32 
and E38 vehicles. It also allows the driverto choice of two damping programs (comfort and 
sport) 

Conventional non-adjustable systems have damper (shock absorber) settings which pro¬ 
vide an acceptable damping action over as wide of range of speeds and loads as possible. 
This means a compromise 

between a high standard of ride comfort on one hand, and a margin of safety on the other. 

Modern technology enables this trade off to be resolved with variable damping, and this 
principle has been adopted on the EDC III system. 

The system uses various input parameters directly relating to road condition, load on the 
car and driving style to select one of three damping characteristics, (soft, medium or hard). 

The result is optimum damping over a wide range of speeds and loads, and definite gains 
in both ride comfort and safety. 

EDC III is a further development of the variable damping systems already used on BM Ws 
in other markets. 

The purpose of any damping force adjustment is to reduce oscillations as perceived by the 
car's occupants, without affecting either handling or driving safety. 

This is achieved by continuously matching the damping force to road conditions, vehicle 
load and driving style.

Components 


Acceleration (Motion) Sensors 

There are three acceleration sensors: one each for 
the front and rear axles (vertical motion), and one 
for forward/aft motion. All sensors are solid state, 
piezo ceramic elements. Vehicle movement on the 
sensors is converted into an electric signal. The 
control module uses these inputs to detect road 
surface condition, vehicle loading and degree of 
motion. The loading of the vehicle influences ver¬ 
tical motion and is therefore detected by the sen¬ 
sors. 

The E38 acceleration sensors are identical to the 
E31/E32 sensors, the longitudinal sensor has 
been deleted on the E38. The dynamic longitudi¬ 
nal forces on the vehicle are calculated from the 
inputs of the front wheel speed sensors. 

The following inputs are used to detect dynamic forces acting on the vehicle; 

Vertical acceleration 
Fore and aft acceleration 
Steering wheel angle 

Vehicle road speed 

Steering Angle Sensor 

The steering angle sensor is 
identical for all vehicles The 
rotating double potentiometer 
provides two variable resis¬ 
tance signals for turn recogni¬ 
tion. The EDC control module 
used this input to increase the 
damping rate when corning.

Control Module 

One basic control module is used for the E38. 
Selecting the proper damping curves is carried out via 
the DISplus or GT-1. The E31/E32 also use a basic 
control module which must be coded for proper vehi¬ 
cle application. Referto the EPC forthe propercontrol 
module. 

Program Switch 



The E38 uses a momentary switch to select comfort or sport. Low for comfort and high 
for sport. The E31 and E32 use a two position rocker switch to select comfort or sport. 




E31/E32 


Comfort Program 

When the comfort program is selected, the priority setting is for soft damping. Any changes 
to dynamic movements detected by the sensor will allow the system to switch to either 
medium or hard depending on how severe the dynamic changes are. The system will auto¬ 
matically switch back to the soft setting when conditions warrant. This results in an ideal 
combination of maximum comfort and optimum driving safety. 

Sport Program 

When the sport program is selected only the medium and hard damping settings are used. 
The control unit selects the medium setting until dynamic changes require a higher damp¬ 
ing force to maintain stability. The program characteristics allow the hard setting to be 
selected sooner and held longer than the comfort program.

Vehicle Road Speed 

The road speed comes 
from the ABS/ASC or 
DSC control module on 
the E38. 

The E31 signal comes 
from the EKM and the 
instrument cluster sup¬ 
plies the signal for the E32. 



Solenoid Controlled Dampers E31/E32 and E38 

The EDC system utilizes solenoid valves to change the valving in the damper to relieve the 
oil flow through additional valves and create a softer damper value. The E38 solenoids are 
mounted internally The E31/E32 use dampers with the solenoid valves mounted external¬ 
ly of the dampers. 

Front axle twin-tube, gas pressurized dampers and rear single tube dampers are used on 
all EDC vehicles. Two solenoid valves are used for each strut assembly These valves pro¬ 
vide an additional passage for the flow of oil in the soft and medium settings. 

Both valves are never energized simultaneously. Damping can be varied front to rear, but 
not side to side. 


E38 wiring for control runs up through piston.

Basic Damper Operation 

When the vehicle bounces the damper travels thru the compression and rebound stages. 
The damper as illustrated corresponds to the EDC sport damper setting because the oil 
basic dampers transfer uses only a mechanical one-way valve. The EDC III system can pro¬ 
vide softer damping rates (soft, medium) by energizing solenoid valves which allow addi¬ 
tional oil volume to transfer.

E38 Solenoid Controlled Damper Operation 

There are three passages for oil transfer in the strut assembly. The first is the main oil trans¬ 
fer valve. This valve is always open. The second and third valves are controlled by the EDC 
solenoids. Through the two different orifices, the solenoids can vary the throughput of 
hydraulic oil transfer thereby regulating the damping force. 

Soft Setting - In this setting the "soft solenoid in each shock is energized allowing oil trans¬ 
fer through the mechanical orifice and larger diameter "soft” orifice. The soft setting pro¬ 
vides oil transfer with the least restriction and the struts are set to the softest damping force. 

Medium Setting - When the EDC control module's processing calls forthe medium setting, 
the soft solenoid is de-energized and the "M edium" solenoid is energized so thatthe oil now 
flows through the smaller valved orifice. This restricted oil flow increased the damping force 
of the strut. 

Hard Setting - When the EDC control module's processing requires the hard setting, the 
medium solenoid is switched "OFF''. This closes the solenoid controlled orifices and only 
allows oil transferthrough the main valve. The struts are now set to the maximum firmness. 

This is also the failsafe setting of the EDC III system. With no power applied to the struts, 
the system will be in the hard setting.

E31/E32 External Solenoid Damper Operation 

The EDC III solenoid operation is identical for both soft and medium settings. The soft sole¬ 
noid has a larger orifice so more oil can pass through the energized solenoid. 

Soft Setting = Soft solenoid energized = M aximum oil transfer 

Medium Setting = Medium solenoid energized = Moderate oil transfer 

Hard Setting = No solenoids energized = No oil transfer through solenoids

Safety Monitoring 

All operating cycles and sensor inputs are checked by the control unit for plausibility and 
function. Any faults that might occur are stored in the defect memory according to there 
p rio rity, 

In the event of certain faults, the control module selects the "medium" damping setting. 
Steering angle sensor 

e.g. bent wiper in sensor (signals do not match; max. deviation 30deg.) or tempo¬ 
rary signal disturbed. 

Steering angle sensor 

e.g. contact difficulties, wiper on conductor of potentiometer, loose contact in con¬ 
ductor. 

Steering angle sensor 

e.g. broken locating pin (sensor always supplies same signal), steering angle sen¬ 
sor not fitted. 


Defective road speed signal 

e.g. break in wire to EDC module. 


Defective acceleration sensor 

e.g. signals not within working range. 


If the soft solenoid fails, the medium setting is selected. 


If the medium solenoid valve circuit or control module fails, the solenoids are de-ener- 
gized which results in the hard or fail-safe setting.
