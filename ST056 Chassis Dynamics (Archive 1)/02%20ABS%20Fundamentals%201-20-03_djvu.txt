Purpose of System 

Anti-Lock Brake System Theory 

The ability to slow or stop a vehicle depends upon the braking forces applied to the wheels 
and the frictional contact that exists between the tires and the road surface. Very low fric¬ 
tional forces exist when the tire is locked (or skidding). A locked tire also causes a loss or 
the lateral locating forces that effect directional control of the vehicle. The result of a locked 
tire (ortires) is the loss of steering control and stability. The majorforces that affect how easy 
a tire will lock include: 

The braking force applied from the vehicles braking system. 

Environmental factors - rain - ice - snow - etc. 

Type and condition of the road surface. 

Condition of the tires (tread and design). 


The anti-lock braking system is designed to allow the maximum amount of braking force to 
be applied to the wheels without allowing the wheels to lock or skid. The advantages that 
AB5 provides includes: 

Driving stability - by maintaining the lateral locating forces between the tires and the road 
surface 


Steerability- allowing the driver to continue to steerthe vehicle while stopping (even dur¬ 
ing panic stops) or accident avoidance maneuvers. 


Provides optimum braking distances - the rolling wheels transfer higher frictional forces to 
slow the vehicle.

Brake Regulation 

In order to prevent the wheels from locking during braking, yet provide the optimum brak¬ 
ing force for maximum braking efficiency, the AB5 braking system must: 

Have the ability to monitor the wheel rotation rates 

Be able to regulate the braking forces applied to the wheels. 

The ABS system carries out these functions with an electronic control system. The com¬ 
ponents of the ABS system include: 

The electronic control module 

The wheel speed sensors 

The brake hydraulic unit 

The brake master cylinder 

The four wheel speed sensors are used as inputs to the control module. The module uses 
these signals to determine wheel speed, wheel acceleration and deceleration. ABS con¬ 
trolled braking starts when the module detects that one or more wheels are about to lock. 

Once activated, the ABS control module pulses the brakes on the affected wheel rapidly (2- 
15 times a second). This allows the vehicle to be slowed down while still maintaining steer¬ 
ability and directional stability. 

The ABS pulses the brakes through solenoids mounted in the hydraulic unit. The solenoids 
regulate the pressure to the affected wheel through three phases of control:

Braking Forces 

When the brakes are applied, brake force counters the inertia of the moving vehicle. This 
force is created by the brake pads acting on the rotors and through the wheel and tire to 
the roadway. Even in the best of conditions, some wheel slip occurs. Up to a point this 
wheel slip is acceptable and in most cases it can even be helpful. 

When braking, the transmitted brake force concentrates at the tire "foot print", where the 
rubber meets the road. This causes a distortion which, when excessive, promotes wheel 
slip. 

When controlled, the distortion can actually enhance the transmission of brake force. 
Therefore, the ABS logic allows wheel slip up to 20-25%. Beyond that the AB5 system lim¬ 
its the application of additional brake force. This allows the transmission of maximum brake 
force while reducing the stopping distance.

Braking Forces (continued) 

The transmission of braking forces and the retention of Lateral Locating Forces are inverse. 
That is to say as braking forces increase the locating forces decrease. 


As indicated in the chart, the rolling wheel has a wheel slip value of 0% which provides the 
best Lateral Locating Forces. 


As the applied brake force increases the locating force decreases. Depending on the pre¬ 
vailing road surface friction, the optimum transmission of brake force is at the end of the 
"stable range” with a wheel slip value of 20-25%. 


Additional brake force at this point is clearly counter-productive as the additional brake 
force only increases wheel slip and reduces Lateral Locating Forces. 


Therefore the AB5 system limits wheel slip by regulating the application of brake force while 
providing the shortest possible stopping distance.

Road Surface 

Clearly the condition of the roadway and weather conditions are significant influences 
regarding wheel slip and the retention of Lateral Locating Forces. 

As road surfaces vary and weather conditions impact the tire's ability to maintain good 
rolling contact, the function of the ABS remains unchanged. Only the stopping distances 
increase due to the regulated transmission of braking force. 

Whatever the road surface or weather, the wheel slip will still be limited to 20-25%. 

Regardless of the ABS system, good judgement and common sense are still 
required.

ABS Operation 

Normal Braking - "Pressure Build" 

The ABS control module constantly monitors and compares the wheel speed sensor sig¬ 
nals. When all four signals are at the same frequency within a small window of tolerance, 
the ABS system is not active and normal braking takes place.

The inlet solenoid valves of 
the hydraulic unit are de¬ 
energized. This maintains 
an open passage from the 
master cylinder to the brake 
calipers. 

The outlet solenoids are also 
de-energized. This main¬ 
tains a closed outlet of the 
brake circuit back to the 
master cylinder reservoir. 

The inactive scenario is 
equal to a conventional 
braking system where the 
driverapplies hydraulic pres¬ 
sure from the brake pedal 
and the brake calipers react 
by compressing the brake 
pads on the rotor.

Pressure Hold 


If the control module detects a decrease in the frequency (rate of deceleration) of one or 
more of the individual signals it perceives this as possible wheel lock. 

The control module energizes the inlet valve for that specific brake circuit. This closes the 
inlet port and prevents any additional hydraulic pressure from being exerted on the brake 
caliper by the driver.

Pressure Drop 

The control module de-energizes the inlet and outlet valves. This returns the brake circuit 
back to normal braking and the hydraulic pressure is once again determined by the driver's 
pedal force. 

This sequence continues rapidly until the wheel speed signals are once again acceptable 
and the contact of the road and the tire surfaces are restored.

Return Pump Activation 

When the system is in reg¬ 
ulation, the brake pedal 
could progressively sink to 
the floor. This would be the 
result of bleeding hydraulic 
pressure during AB5 regu¬ 
lation. 

The return pump maintains 
the pressure between the 
master cylinder and the 
inlet valve to prevent the 
pedal from sinking com¬ 
pletely to the floor. 

This entire sequence of 
events happens repeatedly 
in a split second. The func¬ 
tion of the pump is felt in 
the brake pedal during 
AB5 regulation.

Pressure Drop 

With the inlet valve closed the pressure on the caliper is stabilized and isolated. The con¬ 
trol module energizes the outlet valve which opens the outlet port and drops the pressure 
in the isolated portion of the circuit.
