Dynamic Stability Control (DSC ll/DSC III) 

Purpose of the System 

DSC adds a further dimension to the traction control system. DSC adds lateral control to 
this already proven system. The traction control system was designed for longitudinal 
stability and providing the optimum traction for driving off. 

DSC II has the ability to mildly correct for lateral instability and only at the rear brakes 
when braking control is necessary. 

DSC III has the ability to brake any wheel during cornering maneuvers where the control 
module's programmed limits for vehicle oversteer and understeer are exceeded. 

The DSC II system monitors the input values from the two front wheel speed sensors and 
the steering angle sensor. The rotational speeds of the front wheels for the given turning 
angle are compared to the programmed values in the DSC control module. If the values 
are outside the programmed limits, DSC regulation will be activated. 

New sensors are added to the DSC III system to monitor the rotational rate of the vehicle 
around its vertical axis and a lateral acceleration sensor to monitor the side to side forces 
on the vehicle. 

On DSC II or DSC III systems, the control regulation follows the same outputs as for trac¬ 
tion control regulation with: 

Throttle valve regulation 
Engine intervention 
Rear brake control 

The control phases are brief and only occur long enough to correct the unstable condition. 

The following text in this training manual will focus on Bosch DSC III 5.3 and 5.7. The 
Bosch DSC II system is an enhancement to the existing ASC+T5 system already in use. 
The DSC II system is identical to ASC+T5 with the addition of the steering angle sensorand 
the DSC control unit.

Introduction to DSC 



Dynamic Stability Control (DSC II) 

Dynamic Stability Control II (DSC II) is a further development to the ABS/ASC+T5 traction 
control system. DSC I was introduced in other markets on the E32 and E31 vehicles with 
the M 70 engine. 

The DSC system is designed to improve the lateral stability of the vehicle in all driving situ¬ 
ations. Whereby ASC+T is primarily designed for longitudinal stability and providing the 
optimum traction for driving off, DSC adds lateral stability control to the already proven sys¬ 
tem. 


For any given turning angle and speed of the vehicle, there is a set difference between the 
rotational speeds of the front wheels. If the rotational speeds of the front wheels vary from 
this set difference, it means the vehicle is understeering or oversteering through the turn. 
This could lead to an unstable condition and possible loss of control. 


The DSC system is designed to monitor this rotational difference and react to any changes 
or deviations that might possibly occur. The DSC provides ASC control forthe vehicle while 
driving through corners or any time the vehicle is not moving straight ahead. 


In essence, the ASC+T5 becomes a Dynamic Stability Control System with this added fea¬ 
ture.

DSC III 5.3 Components 

The Bosch DSC III 5.3 System consists of the following components: 

DC III Control Module 83 Pin 

Wheel Speed Sensors (Active Hall Effect) 

Hydraulic Pressure Sensor 
Steering Angle Sensor 
Rotation Rate (Yaw Sensor) 

Lateral Acceleration Sensor 
DSC Switch 
Hand Brake Switch 
Brake Switch 
Pre-Charging Pump 
Hydraulic Unit 

Charging Piston (750iL only) 

Bosch DSC III 5.7 Components 

With the exception of the following, all components of the DSC - 5.3 are carried over and 
their functional operation remains the same. 

Control Module/Hydraulic Unit - Control Module and hydraulic unit have been 
combined into one assembly. The unit now includes the hydraulic unit, control 
module and return pump. 

Rotational Rate/Lateral Acceleration Sensor - These two sensors have been 
combined into one housing located under the driver's seat (under carpet). 

Brake Pressure Sensor - The brake pressure sensor is installed in the 
hydraulic unit housing. This performs the same function as the previous hydraulic 
pressure sensor.

Introduction to DSC 



Control Module/ Hydraulic Unit 

The control module used on the DSC III sys¬ 
tems varies between models. The DSC III 
5.3 system uses the same control module 
configuration at the ASC+T5 system. 

The control module is an 83 pin unit located 
in the E-box. 

The DSC III 5.7 system integrates the control 
module into the hydraulic unit. This reduces 
the size and wiring required for DSC opera¬ 
tion. Additionally the motor relay and valve 
relay have been replaced by solid state final 
stages in the control module. 



83 Pin Control Module Bosch DSC III 5.3 


On E39 and E39 applications, the control module/hydraulic unit is located ahead of the 
passenger side strut tower. The hydraulic unit contains the following components: 


Two pre-charge solenoid valves 


Two changeover solenoid valves 
Four intake solenoid valves 


Four outlet solenoid valves 


One return pump 




Introduction to DSC 






















Wheel Speed Sensors 

The wheel speed sensors used are the same as on previous E38 and E39 models. The 
sensor is a hall effect type which sends a digital square wave to the DSC control unit. 
Unique to this sensor is the two wire versus three wire configuration as on most hall effect 
circuits. 

The two wire hall effect wheel speed sensors receive a stabilized 8 volt power supply from 
the control module through one wire. The ground path for the sensor is through the sec¬ 
ond wire back to the control module. 

The signal is generated by a pulse wheel affecting the voltage flow through the hall element 
in the sensor. The pulse wheel is integrated into the wheel bearing assembly behind the 
seal. This protects the trigger wheel from foreign substances which may affect the wheel 
speed signal. 

This creates a square wave signal with a low of .75 volts and a high of 2.5 volts.

Introduction to DSC 













































Hydraulic Pressure Sensor (Brake Pressure) 

The hydraulic system pressure sensor provides a 0-5 volt linear voltage signal to the DSC 
III control module. The linear voltage is a proportionate indication of how hard the driver is 
pressing on the brake pedal. The signal is provided as an additional determining factorfor 
the DSC III control module to monitor the hydraulic pressure present during all phases of 
operation, including: 


No Braking 


Partial Braking NearABS regulation state. 


The sensor has three pins, power, ground and the 0-5 volt signal. The sensor is capable 
of monitoring pressure from 0-250bar. The sensor is located in the front brake hydraulic 
circuit., the actual location varies by the following application: 


DSC III 5.3 (740i/iL and 540i) - The brake pressure sensor is located in the charge 
pump assembly. 


DSC III 5.3 (750iL) - The sensor is located on the charge piston unit. 


DSC III 5.7 (ALL) - The sensor is located on the hydraulic unit.

Introduction to DSC 
















Steering Angle Sensor 


The steering angle sensor is mounted at the bottom of the steering column near the flexi¬ 
ble coupling. 


The sensor is a new type which differs from the DSC II system. This sensor is equipped 
with a processor and is directly linked to the CAN bus to communicate with the DSC mod¬ 
ule. 


The sensor also contains the EDC III steering angle sensor in the same housing but it is not 
on the CAN bus and the signal output to the EDC III control unit remains unchanged. 


The sensor still utilizes two potentiometers to determine the steering angle and the rate of 
steering angle change. These are the raw signals the CAN bus microprocessor utilizes to 
create the steering angle signal for broadcast over the CAN bus. 


As with DSCII, this sensor still requires calibration after repairs to the steering or suspen¬ 
sion system. Once the calibration is completed, the sensor now also sends as identifica¬ 
tion number over the CAN bus to the DSC III module. The ID provides confirmation is the 
DSC module that the steering angle sensor is properly calibrated. 


If the ID differs due to component swapping, it will not be possible to enter the DSC sys¬ 
tem for diagnosis. The Diagnosis Program will request that the steering angle sensor be 
recalibrated using "Service Functions”. Once complete, a new ID number is generated and 
the DSC module and steering angle sensor are properly mated. 


The DSC III logic checks the plausibility of the steering angle sensor against other DSC III 
inputs (front wheel speeds, rotation rate and lateral acceleration sensors). If the batten/ 
voltage is interrupted, the current steering wheel rotation is recalculated by the DSC mod¬ 
ule evaluating front wheel speeds. 



CAN BUS MICROPROCESSOR 



Introduction to DSC 







Rotation Rate Sensor (Bosch 5.3) 

The new sensor is a major contributor of 
the expanded capabilities of DSC III. When 
the rotation rate sensor was introduced 
with DSC III 5.3, the sensor was a stand 
alone sensor located under the drivers 
seat. On DSC III 5.7, the sensor is now a 
combined sensor which also houses the 
lateral acceleration sensor.

To access the sensor, the seat must be 
removed, the doorjamb interior trim pulled 
out of the way and the carpet rolled back. 
A sound insulating foam shell covers the 
sensor, this too must be pulled upward off 
of the sensor prior to removal. 

Sensor Operation 

The sensor is a sealed, self contained 
microprocessor that monitors the vehicle’s 
rate of rotational acceleration on it's vertical 
axis. This is referred to as the "yaw” angle. 
The sensor contains an internal oscillating 
cylinder which is excited by various piezo 
elements to an oscillation frequency of 
14KHz. This puts the cylinder in a free 
floating neutral state, (zero point) 

When driving, the cylinder is deflected 
(rotated) by the effect of the forces from the 
vehicle cornering - this produces the tor¬ 
sional "twist" on the cylinder. 

The sensor counteracts the "twist" of the 
cylinder by increasing the pulse frequency 
of the piezo elements to deflect the cylinder 
back to it’s zero point. 




Components are not serviceable. 
Photos are for reference only. 


Oscillating 

Cylinder 


The pulse frequency increase in measured and represent the real 
time vehicle rotation rate. Based on the measurement, the sensor 
produces a linear DC voltage that the DSC III control module uses 
to determine yaw angle. 




Introduction to DSC 





























Rotation Rate Sensor Signals 

The DSC III control module provides the rotation rate sensor with 12 volts operating power 
and ground. In return, the sensor provides: 

A standing 2.5 volt reference voltage signal (pin 4 of sensor) 

A linear voltage signal ranging from 0.7 to 4.3 volts (pin 3 of sensor) 

The linear voltage equates to a range of -50° (,7V) to +50° (4.3V) vehicle rotation rate 
change per second. The DSC III control module monitors the signal voltage even/ 20ms.

In conjunction with the steering angle, front wheel speeds and lateral forces, the rotation 
rate signal provides confirmation of a vehicle pushing the limits of acceptable yaw. The 
DSC III control module then regulates the torque output of the vehicle and manipulates the 
brake system hydraulics as needed to correct for the under/oversteer condition. 

For continual plausibility testing, the DSC control module send a predetermined test volt¬ 
age signal to the rotation rate sensor (pin 5 of sensor). The sensor calculates the voltage 
value and sends feedback to the DSC III control module over the signal line (pin 2) even/ 
other 20ms signal cycle. If the feedback is out of plausible range the DSC III module sets 
a fault. 


The DSC III module also checks the actual signal for plausibility by comparing it to com¬ 
bined signals from the front wheel speed sensors, lateral acceleration sensor and the steer¬ 
ing angle signal from the CAN bus. 


Sensor Replacement 


If the rotation rate sensor is replaced, the new sensor must be calibrated with the DSC III 
control module through the Service Function Menu of the Diagnosis program using the 
DIS plus or GT-1.

Lateral Acceleration Sensor (Bosch 5.3) 

This new sensor is a major contributor of the expanded 
capabilities of DSC III. 

It is located under the drivers seat but mounted on the ver¬ 
tical surface of the inner rocker sill, (approximately 2" 
front of the B pillar). 

The drivers seat and doorjamb trim must be removed and 
the floor coverings pulled out of the way to access the lat¬ 
eral acceleration sensor. 

Sensor Operation 

The lateral acceleration sensor is connected to the DSC 
control module by a 3 pin plug. The sensor receives oper¬

MOVEMENT (LATERAL ACCELERATION) 



1- Floor Covering 2 - 3 Pin Plug 
2 - Mounting Screws 


ating power and ground. It return, it provides a linear volt¬ 
age signal which is a measurement of "side to side" G-force acceleration. 

The voltage range is from 0.5 to 4.5 volts which corresponds to a G force range of 
-1.5 to +3.5 g. 

With the vehicle stationary on a level surface, approximately 1.7 volts is present on 
the signal line. This is indicative of the nominal value of O.Og. 


The sensor is a capacitive type sensor. Under the effects of lateral acceleration, a moving 
capacitor plate moves in relation to a fixed capacitor plate. The result is a signal propor¬ 
tional to the effect of lateral acceleration. 

The signal provides additional information which enables the DSC III logic a higher level of 
sensing the vehicles handling characteristics. 

The DSC regulation is calculated from: 

The steering input from the desired vehicle direction from the driver 

The Rotation Rate sensor to determine the "yaw” of the vehicle 

The left and right front wheel speed to verify the turning rate in the corner 


These inputs allow the DSC logic to calculate the under/over steer while cornering, and the 
rate of the vehicle speed entering the corner. For this calculation, the DSC can then com¬ 
pensate by reducing engine torque, and applying the appropriate braking to stabilize the 
vehicle for safer handling. 



Introduction to DSC 















Combined Rotation Rate/Lateral Acceleration Sensor (Bosch DSC III 5.7) 


On DSC III (Bosch 5.7) the Rotation Rate sensor and the Lateral Acceleration sensor have 
been combined into one unit. The sensor is located under the driver's seat and it is small¬ 
er in size and weight and is isolated from chassis vibrations through it's rubber mounting. 


The sensor provides the same information as the two spearate sensors used on DSC 5.3. 
It receives the same power and ground from the DSC control module. 


For rotational speed, the sensor produces a refernece signal of 2.5 volts and a linear volt¬ 
age from 0.7 to 4.3 volts. This linear voltage input signal is used by the DSC control mod¬ 
ule as the degree of rotational rate (yaw). 


The sensor also produces a linear voltage signal from 0.5 to 4.5 volts. The DSC control 
module used this input to determine the side forces acting on the vehicle for DSC regula¬ 
tion

DSC Switch 


The system is active whenever the ignition is switched 
on. When pressed, the switch provides a momentary 12 
volt signal to the DSC control module to switch the sys¬ 
tem off. The DSc indictator in the cluster will be illumi¬ 
nated to indicate that the system is off. When pressed 
again, the system switches back on and the DSC indi¬ 
cator goes off. 



Handbrake Switch 


The handbrake switch is a ground 
input the DSC module. MSR reg¬ 
ulation is cancelled when there is a 
"Handbrake On" signal present. 




Brake Switch 

The brake switch is used to activate the ABS 
functions in the DSC III module. If the system 
receives a brake switch signal when in ASC 
mode and regulating, ASC regulation is can¬ 
celled. 

The ABS regulating phase is also cancelled 
when the brake switch signal is not present.

To ensure sufficient brake fluid supply is always available to the hydraulic unit during ASC/ 
DSC hydraulic regulation, the system requires an additional pumping system not equipped 
on any previous ASC+T system. 

The pumping systems are different on the 750il_ compared with the 740i/iL & 540iA and are 
as follows: 


740i/iL & 540iA = Charge pump - located next to the master cylinder. 


750iL = Pre-boost pump and separate charge piston. These components are also 
mounted next to the brake fluid master cylinder and fluid reservoir.

Hydraulic Charge 

Existing A5C+T and DSC II systems already perform hydraulic control regulation but do not 
require the additional charge pump systems. Why 7 The reason being those systems only 
actuate the rear axle circuits. Obviously the DSC III system has the capability to actuate 
front and rear axle circuits together which requires additional hydraulic fluid supply. 

For this reason, during an ASC or DSC regulation function requiring hydraulic interven¬ 
tion, the DSC III control module switches the electrical charge pump on to provide this addi¬ 
tional fluid. 

740i/iL & 540iA Vehicles: 

When activated, the Charge Pump delivers a brake pressure of 10 -15 barto the front axle 
circuit of the hydraulic unit and into the front axle circuit pressure chamber of of the master 
cylinder. The master cylinder piston for the front axle circuit contains a notched restrictor 
forward of the central valve which allows excess fluid to return to the reservoir under a 
restriction. 

The pressurized fluid also acts on the rear axle circuit of the master cylinder. This provides 
the hydraulic charge to the rear axle circuit of the hydraulic unit as needed.

750iL Vehicles: 

The electric Pre-boost pump delivers a brake fluid pressure of 7-15 bar to the isolated 
chamber of the charge piston. The pre-boost pump incorporates an integral pressure 
relief valve which opens at 15 bar. 

From the isolated chamber the fluid returns to the reservoir through a restriction. The 
restriction causes pressure to build in the chamber which pushes the pistons outward. This 
immediately acts on two valves which block the normal braking circuits that flow through 
the charge piston ports. 


The pressure in the isolated chamber 
continues to push the pistons outward 
delivering the required charge pressure.

For ABS and CBC operation, the pump systems are not switched on, only during 
ASC/DSC regulation requiring hydraulic intervention are the pre-boost pump or the charge 
pump switched on. The balance of the hydraulic system functions operate in the same 
familiar manor of all previous systems. The individual brake circuits can be isolated as 
needed to restore lateral locating forces through pressure build, hold and release phases of 
operation. During an ASC hydraulic intervention requiring only rearwheel brake application, 
the inlet valves for the front wheels are closed preventing any pressure influence from the 
charge pump systems.

Principle of Operation 
Dynamic Stability Control Systems 

Introduction 

Dynamic Stability Control (DSC III version 5.3) was introduced on the 1998 M odel Year E38 
and E39 - 540 vehicles. For M odel Year 1999, the system is enhanced with additional con¬ 
trol functions and a new combined rotational rate/lateral acceleration sensor as version 5.7. 
It continues to be offered as standard equipment in the E38 and E39 - 540 models. The 
new functions are titled as the Dynamic Braking System and include the: 

Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) 

Maximum Brake Control (MBC) 

DSC III adds a further dimension to the dynamic stability control system. DSC II has the 
ability to mildly correct for lateral instability and only at the rear brakes when braking con¬ 
trol is necessary. DSC III has the ability to brake any wheel during cornering maneuvers 
where the control module's programmed limits for vehicle oversteer and understeer are 
exceeded. 

New sensors are added to the DSC III system to monitor the rotational rate of the vehicle 
around its vertical axis and a lateral acceleration sensor to monitor the side to side forces 
on the vehicle. 

The hydraulic system of the DSC II has also been modified to allow brake regulation on 
the front wheels and to ensure that the supply of brake fluid for DSC II regulation is main¬ 
tained. 

Two different hydraulic systems are used on the Bosch 5.3 DSC system as follows: 

740i/iL & 540iA use a charge pump for the front brake circuit. 

750il_ uses a boost pump and separate charge piston for both the front and 
rear brake circuits. 

The hydraulic system used on the Bosch DSC III 5.7 has changed on the E38 and E39. 
The 750il_ now uses a similar hydraulic system tothe 740i/iL and 540i. The charge piston 
and pre-boost pump have been eleminated. The brake pressure sensor is now located in 
the hydraulic unit on all Bosch 5.7 systems.

Introduction to DSC 



Dynamic Stability Control (DSC III) 


All of the familiar braking and straight line traction control features and system communi¬ 
cation carry over from DSC II. Based on select high/select low logic, the DSC III control 
module selects a vehicle stabilizing strategy based on the specific input signal values it is 
monitoring at the moment. For all DSC strategies this begins with engine intervention to 
reduce torgue: 


Forthe 750iL this is handled via CAN communication, DSC III to EML to minimize 
the throttle angle of the DK motors (750il_). Forthe 740i/il_ and 540iA this is handled 
by direct DSC III activation of the ADS II throttle housing. 

If additional torque reduction is necessary, DSC III informs DM E over CAN to: 


a. Retard ignition timing 


b. Shut down the fuel injection to individual cylinders 


DSC III monitors under/oversteer conditions through the following components 


The driver’s desired steering angle - steering angle signal over CAN bus 


Vehicle speed and speed differential at front wheels - wheel speed sensors 

Dynamic forces of lateral acceleration and yaw placed on the vehicle. This is poss 
ble with these two new components. The results are as follows:

Transmission system intervention also occurs during any A5C/DSC regulating phase. 
Through CAN bus communication the AGS control module is informed to delay any gear 
changes during regulation. This prevents any unwanted driveline dynamic changes during 
DSC regulation. 


Though DSC III provides state of the art, electronic correction of undesirable vehicle han¬ 
dling characteristics, it is important to remember vehicle stability is always subject to the 
physical laws of centrifugal force and extreme road conditions. Good judgement and 
common sense on the part of the driver are still required.

DSC Features 


Corner Braking Control (CBC) 

CBC is a feature of dynamic stability control that is designed to improve the vehicle’s sta¬ 
bility if the driver brakes while driving through a curve. If the vehicle is braked while driving 
through a curve, an unequal braking force will be applied to the wheels due to the weight 
shift of the vehicle to the outside of the turn. Based on the vehicle speed and the speed 
differential of the two front wheel speed sensors, the control module can determine if CBC 
needs to be activated when the driver applies the brakes. If CBC is activated, the regula¬ 
tion will pulse the wheel brakes on the outside of the vehicle to provide an equal braking 
force on all four wheels. 

Dynamic Braking System (DBS) 

The dynamic braking system is designed to enhance the braking control of the DSC forthe 
driver of the vehicle. The dynamic braking control and maximum braking control are func¬ 
tions that are programmed into the control electronics of the DSC with no additional hard¬ 
ware changes. The Dynamic braing system features consist of DBC and M BC. 

Dynamic Braking Control (DBC) 

The DBC function is designed to provide the maximum braking force available during rapid 
(panic) braking situations. The DSC control module looks at the inputs from the brake pedal 
switch and the signal from the brake pressure sensor on the master cylinder. The criteria 
for activation of DBC is how rapidly is the brake pressure built up with the brake pedal 
depressed. The total criteria required for DBC activation includes: 

Brake switch ON 

Brake pressure build up >threshold value 

Vehicle road speed > 5M PH 

Vehicle not in reverse 

Not all wheels in ABS regulation 

If the threshold for DBC activation is achieved, the DSC control module will activate a pres¬ 
sure build up regulation phase through the hydraulic unit. The pressure at all wheels is 
increased up to the ABS regulation point. This occurs even if the driver does not achieve 
the ABS regulation point with the pedal. 

The rear axle brakes are controlled with select-low regulation and the front axle brakes are 
controlled individually. ABS regulation will continue until the driver releases the pedal and 
the pressure in the master cylinder drops below the threshold value stored in the DSC con¬ 
trol module. 



Introduction to DSC 



Maximum Brake Control 


The MBC function is also designed to enhance a driver initiated braking procedure. The 
M BC will build up the pressure in the rear brake circuit when the front brakes are already in 
an ABS regulation cycle. The additional braking pressure at the rear wheels will shorten the 
stopping distance. The following criteria must be met before the DSC control module will 
activate MBC: 

Both front wheel brakes in ABS regulation 
Vehicle speed > 5 MPH 
Vehicle not in reverse 

DBC and pressure sensor initialization test OK 
Rear wheels not in ABS regulation

Coding 


Coding must be performed after replace¬ 
ment of the DSC III control module or the 
steering angle sensor. ZCS coding is found 
in the Coding and Programming selection 
from the start screen or when pressing the 
Change button. Follow on-screen instruc¬ 
tions for initialization of components after 
completing the coding process. 


Adjustment Functions 



Adjustment (initialization) is required when: 


Replacing the DSC III Control Unit. 


Replacing/Re-coding the Steering Angle Sensor. 


Replacing one or both Brake Pressure Sensors. 
Replacing Lateral Acceleration Sensor. 


Steering Angle Sensor 


The steering angle sensor requires an offset adjustment afterthe sensor has been replaced, 
coded or after repairs to the steering or suspension system. The offset adjustment informs 
the steering angle sensor processor of the straight ahead position of the front wheels. 


The adjustment is performed by completing the Test Module found in Service Functions. 
Once the adjustment is complete the sensor sends an identification number over the CAN 
bus to the DSC control unit. The ID provides confirmation that the steering angle sensor is 
coded and has successfully completed the adjustment procedure.
