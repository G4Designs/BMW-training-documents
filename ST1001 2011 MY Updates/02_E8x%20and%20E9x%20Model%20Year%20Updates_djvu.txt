E89 BMW Z4 sDrive35is 


Since its launch in May 2009 the BMW Z4 can look back on very successful sales 
figures. With over 18300 cars sold from May to November 2009, world wide, BMW has 
been able to sell almost twice as many units of the two-seater Roadster as the competi¬ 
tion. 

Combining classic proportions with modern features, the BMW Z4 Roadster enjoys the 
top spot in its class. The best selling Roadster is now getting a high-performance 
upgrade. 

The BMW Z4 sDrive35is with the N54B30T0 engine delivers performance figures com¬ 
parable to that of the Audi TT RS or Mercedes SLK 55 AMG. The Z4 offers significantly 
lower fuel consumption and C02 emissions figures thanks to the use of BMW Efficient 
Dynamics. 

Furthermore, the range of optional extras is extended to include an attractive M Sports 
package, which is optionally available for all BMW Z4 engine versions.

E8x and E9x Model Year Updates 




































































The 2011 BMW Z4 sDrive35is debuted at the Detroit Auto Show (January 2010). The 
US market launch of these vehicles was scheduled for March 2010 to coincide with the 
beginning of the open-air (convertible) season. 

The Z4 sDrive35is is the latest among a long line of previous BMW vehicle to sport the 
“s” to signify a higher level of sport orientation. BMW began including the “s” denomina¬ 
tion in models like the E21 320is in the early 1980’s to denote a sport package or sport 
edition vehicle. The 3 Series, 5 Series, and X5 have all had the “s” incorporated into 
their badges at some point in history. 



The latest Z4 model is characterized by instantaneous response to the accelerator pedal, 
fantastic sound, and a free-revving spirit. The engine features increased air intake flow 
and increased boost pressure to release more power with the same standard of 
efficiency. 

The BMW Z4 sDrive35is includes new M Sport upgrades such as M Aerodynamics and 
adaptive M Suspension. The adaptive M Suspension combines a ride-height reduction 
of 10 millimeters (almost 0.4”) with electronically controlled shock absorbers (Dynamic 
Damping Control) to improve the vehicle’s agility without compromising ride comfort. 

The M Sport upgrades emphasize the Z4’s athletic character through aerodynamically 
optimized exterior features and customized interior components. 

Electric Power Steering (EPS) on the BMW Z4 sDrive35is features very sporty program¬ 
ming, focused to provide intense and clear steering feedback to the driver. This enables 
the driver to turn-in with remarkable precision and confidence at all vehicle speeds.

Powertrain 


The N54B30T0 engine features increased air intake flow and increased boost pressure 
to release more power with the same standard of efficiency. The combination of twin 
low-mass turbochargers and high precision direct injection offers an output comparable 
to that of larger displacement engines. 



View of the Z4 sDrive35is engine compartment with N54B30T0 engine 


The engine of the new BMW Z4 sDrive35is maintains a high output throughout the 
entire engine speed range. Nominal peak torque is increased to 332 Ib-ft from 1,500 
rpm to 4,500 rpm and the maximum power output of 335 hp is delivered at 5,900 rpm. 
This is a significant increase compare to the standard N54B3000 engine used in Z4 
sDrive35i model.

The enhanced engine management system of the BMW Z4 sDrive35is also includes an 
electronically-controlled overboost function to briefly increase torque under full load by 
another 37 Ib-ft. This temporary torque peak of 500 Nm/369 Ib-ft gives the car a signifi¬ 
cant increase in acceleration. 



The BMW Z4 sDrive35is will complete the sprint from a standstill to 100km/h/62 mph in 
just 4.8 seconds. Top speed of the BMW Z4 sDrive35is is limited electronically to 250 
km/h/155 mph. 

The exhaust system of the BMW Z4 sDrive35is has been tuned specifically for this 
model. Acoustic engineering gives the car a very unique sound pattern across the speed 
range. This tuned sound is the result of special baffles and a unique set of mufflers. The 
sound is characterized by a deep rumble with a focus on the low frequency sound range. 


Note: The N54B30T0 engine with 335hp is used in the top model of the E89 
(BMW Z4 sDrive35is) and in the BMW 335is. The 335is also has an 369 
Ib-ft overboost function but has 320hp.

Double-clutch Transmission 

The standard equipment 7 speed double-clutch transmission makes a significant contri¬ 
bution to the performance of the BMW Z4 sDrive35is. In addition to automatic mode the 
driver can change gears manually with the electronic gear selector or gearshift paddles 
on the steering wheel. Fast and smooth gear changes without an interruption in traction 
contribute to the low fuel consumption and emission figures.

The following features refer to the DCT transmission: 

• A stronger dual-mass flywheel was specially designed for the increased power 
output. 

• DCT Automatic mode was adapted to the engine’s output characteristics and supe¬ 
rior performance. 

• Specially modified shift points in conjunction with the Sport and Sport+ modes 
of Dynamic Driving Control provide an especially dynamic driving experience. 

• As a special feature of the DCT, the “Launch Control” function is available for 
optimum acceleration from a standstill. 


Note: For more information regarding the “Launch Control” feature 
of the DCT refer to the vehicle owner’s manual.

E92/E93 LCI 3 Series 


The new BMW 2011 3 Series Coupe and Convertible LCI, include outstanding style 
updates for 328i and 335i models with a new engine for 335i. The 2011 3 Series 
Coupe and Convertible models went on sale in the US market in the spring of 2010. 



Each car’s essential attributes of rear-wheel drive (xDrive is only available on the Coupe), 
near-perfect 50-50 weight distribution, remarkably precise steering, and skillfully engi¬ 
neered suspension are fundamentally unchanged. 


All-new is the N55 engine for the 335i model. This turbocharged, all-aluminum engine 
features essentially the same “short block” and 3.0-liter displacement of its predecessor 
(N54), but benefits from five additional years worth of development and refinement. This 
is the first BMW engine to combine direct injection, single twin scroll turbocharger, dou¬ 
ble VANOS and Valvetronic system (Valvetronic III). The result is an engine that is more 
responsive, more fuel efficient and cleaner-running than its outstanding predecessor, 
but still maintains the same 300 horsepower and 300 Ib-ft of torque with a 7,000 rpm 
redline. 

The combination of lines flowing into one another elegantly emphasizes the vehicles’ 
performance potential. The shoulder line rises slightly but consistently from front to rear. 
The character line flows in a long, stretched arch all the way from the front fender to the 
new taillights. As the sill line was moved up slightly to the rear in a slow and gentle 
curve. The fender flare around each rear wheel also serves to give the character line 
extra tension in both an upward and outward direction. 

Attractive new innovations at the front, side, and rear - integrated precisely into the 
overall look of the car- give greater emphasis to the sportiness of both models. At the 
same time, these modifications slightly extend the overhangs front and rear (now 1.14” 
and 0.12” longer, respectively), which adds a sleeker and even more athletic 
appearance.

E92/E93 BMW 335is 


With the US market launch of the E93 and E92 335is models in the spring of 2010, 
BMW introduced the higher output N54B30T0 engine (Same engine the E89 Z4 
sDrive35is) to the 3 Series. 

The E92 & E93 335is follow the launch of the Z4 sDrive35is and a long line of previous 
BMWs that have received an “s” to signify a higher level of sport orientation. BMW 
began including the “s” denomination in models like the E21 320is in the early 1980’s 
to denote a sport package or sport edition vehicle. The 3 Series, 5 Series, and X5 have 
all had the “s” incorporated into their badges at some point in history. These vehicles 
typically had sport-oriented equipment like sport seats, special wheels, sport steering 
wheels, sport suspension, exterior aerodynamic components, and performance 
upgrades. 

The 335is Coupe and Convertible can be ordered with either a “G” manual gearbox 
(GS6-53BZ) or the optional 7 speed double-clutch transmission (GS7D36SG). The 
engine cooling system has been enhanced with an auxiliary radiator, oil to air heat 
exchanger and an 850 W fan. 


The E92 335is will be introduced later (05/2010) with standard fog lights discontinued. 
Fog lamps are still available on the E93 335is.
