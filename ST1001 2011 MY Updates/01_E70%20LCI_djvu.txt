E70 Life Cycle Impulse 


Introduction 


Overview 

The BMW E70 X5 was introduced to the US market for 2007 as a luxury SAV in the 
luxury vehicle class. The spacious interior provides innovative equipment features with 
maximum functionality and sitting for up to seven people. It set new standards in 
efficiency among its competitors. 

This 2010 E70 model LCI (life cycle pulse), includes several exterior enhancements. 
The two new engines introduced have additional Efficient Dynamics measures which 
deliver optimum power and torque with excellent fuel economy and emissions. Due in 
part to the introduction of the eight speed automatic transmission that provides precise 
shifting and a smooth driving experience and the standard equipment Brake Energy 
Regeneration. 



Available Engines 

As of April 2010, the E70 LCI is offered in following model variants: 

• BMW X5 xDrive35i 

N55B30M0 engine (225 kW/300hp and 400 Nm/300lb-ft) 

• BMW X5 xDrive50i 

N63B44O0 engine (300 kW/400hp and 600 Nm/450lb-ft) 

• BMW X5 xDrive35d US (Advanced Diesel with BluePerformance) 
M57D30T2 engine (200 kW/265hp and 580 Nm/425lb-ft) as previously.

Exterior 


Front 

The exterior enhancements of the LCI help to accentuate the sporty character of the X5. 
The side air intakes have been enlarged for improved cooling and the front fenders have 
been modified to accommodate the new front facia. The black plastic trim at the bottom 
edge of the body is reduced to show more painted surface. 

The newly designed front of the E70 LCI is characterized by the following features:

Dashboard 

The elegant dashboard with the typical BMW driver orientation was enhanced by the 
high quality and harmony of the materials used.

Diver Assistance Systems 

The E70 LCI is available (from May 2010) with the following driver-assistance systems: 

• Side-view Camera 

• ACC Stop & Go 

• Lane departure warning

E70 Life Cycle Impulse 





Side-view Camera 

The two side view cameras are located in the left and right upper corner of the front of 
the bumper. They ensure an additional field of vision in poor visibility situations and allow 
early detection of traffic approaching from the sides when pulling out or entering roads. 



E70 LCI Side-view Camera 


Note: For detailed information on "Side-view Camera" see the new 

BMW 5 series “F10 Complete Vehicle" training material available 
on TIS and ICP. 

ACC Stop & Go 

Active Cruise Control regulates speed when the road ahead is clear and switches auto¬ 
matically to distance control when the sensor for ACC Stop & Go detects a slower mov¬ 
ing vehicle in the lane ahead. In this way Active Cruise Control not only assists the driver 
on little-used roads, but also in heavy traffic. Active Cruise Control takes over the routine 
of accelerating for the driver precisely adjusting the distance and speed with regard to 
other road users. 

The Stop & Go function of the Active Cruise Control can bring the vehicle to a complete 
stop if necessary. If the vehicle ahead begins to move again after having stopped, the 
driver is notified. To pull away again, the driver has to acknowledge the message. The 
pulling-away process is controlled fully automatically by ACC Stop & Go only if the dura¬ 
tion of the stop is very short.

The sensor for the ACC Stop & Go is located behind the lower 
grill in the front bumper cover.

ACC-Sensor 


The LCI E70 now can be ordered with Active Cruise Control w/Stop & Go. A new sensor 
is used for this function which is already known from the F10. Because E70 does not 
use an ICM, In this application the sensor is not connected to the integrated chassis 
management (ICM) control unit but rather to the longitudinal dynamics management 
(LDM) control unit as in the E6X LCI vehicles. 

The sensor for ACC Stop & Go is a radar-based sensor designed to detect the range of 
the vehicles traveling in our path. Both the short range and the long range radars are 
incorporated in one sensor. 

The sensor sends out focused electromagnetic waves with a transmission frequency of 
76-77 GHz. The echoes reflected from objects are received and evaluated by the sen¬ 
sor. In this way, the sensor can gain information about the size, distance and the speed 
of the objects in front of it. 


Note: For a detailed description of the new ACC sensor and the operation of 
"ACC Stop & Go" system refer to the BMW 5 Series F10 training 
material available on TIS and ICP.

Powertrain 

New Engines 

The E70 LCI is available with two new gasoline engines, both have higher performance 
but almost the same fuel consumption and emission levels as their predecessors. The 
E70 LCI diesel (xDrive35d) however, will see no changes to its powertrain. 

The following table lists the most important specifications regarding the engines 
installed on the E70 LCI.

GA8HP Automatic Transmission 

The E70 LCI is standard eguipped with the new GA8HP eight speed automatic trans¬ 
mission on all gasoline models. Especially close gears ratios allow better use of the opti¬ 
mum speed ranges. This increases the driving dynamics and shifting comfort while 
enhancing fuel economy and emissions. 

The GA8HP45Z is installed with the N55B30M0 engine in the xDrive35i. 

The GA8HP70Z is installed with the N63B44O0 engine in the xDrive50i. 

Note: For more information regarding the GA8HP automatic transmission 
refer to the F07 and F10 training material available on TIS and ICP.

Transmission Emergency Release 

There is a new operating concept used for releasing the transmission parking lock 
mechanism (transmission parking lock emergency release). The existing transmission 
emergency release is being gradually removed from all vehicles with the 8 speed auto¬ 
matic transmissions, beginning with the E70 LCI. 

In the event of a fault affecting the powertrain, the transmission parking lock can be 
unlocked mechanically and put in “Neutral” by means of a set screw/stop (adjusting 
screw) that acts on the gear selector lever. In addition to the mechanical transmission 
parking lock emergency release, the procedure to put the vehicle in “Neutral” can also 
be done electronically via ISTA.

CAUTION!!! 


The operation of both the mechanical and electrical parking lock emergency 
release may only be done by BMW service personnel. To actuate the 
mechanical transmission parking lock emergency release the vehicle must 
be lifted and the underbody paneling removed. This is necessary in the event 
the vehicle has to be put on a flatbed for transportation to the service 
department.

Headlights 

The E70 LCI comes with Xenon headlights and cornering lights as standard equipment. 
The following figure shows the Xenon headlights for low and high beam. The cornering 
light (Adaptive light control SA 524) uses Xenon headlamps (3) and the fog lamps also 
perform cornering light function.
