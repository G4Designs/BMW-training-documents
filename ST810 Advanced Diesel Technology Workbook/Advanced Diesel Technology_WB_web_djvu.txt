Advanced Diesel Technology 

Model: E90 (335d) and E70 (XDrive35d) 

Production: From September 2008 



After completion of this module you will be able to: 

• Locate diesel related components 

• Understand diesel emission control systems

Advanced Diesel Technology Introduction 


U.S. Market Diesel Introduction 

Beginning with model year 2009, BMW will introduce 2 diesel 
models for the first time since 1987. The E90 and E70 will be 
available with the new M57D30T2 (US) engine. 



The two new models will meet the EPA Tier 2, Bin 5 reguirements 
and will be considered “50 State” legal. In order to comply with 
these new stringent regulations, both vehicles have the latest in 
emission control and engine management technology. 

Both vehicles will be eguipped with the latest Selective Catalytic 
Reduction system to reduce unwanted NO x emissions. Also, the 
X5 will have an additional Low Pressure EGR system to further 
assist in the reduction of NO x . 

The E90 will be known as the 335d, while the E70 will reflect the 
new naming strategy as the X5 “Xdrive35d”. 



In addition to having a new engine, the new diesel powered 
3-series will also be considered a “face-lifted” version (or LCI) 
with other changes to be detailed in future training. 

The newX5 Xdrive35d and 335d will be available in the late fall 
of 2008 with the same impressive six-cylinder diesel engine. 

The provisional fuel economy data is as follows: 

• 23/36 mpg (city/hwy) for the 335d 

• 19/26 mpg (city/hwy) for the X5 (X Drive 35d) 

Note: The above fuel economy data is provisional. 

The official EPA data is not currently available

Advanced Diesel Technology 


A Diesel Engine for North America 

Impressive power and performance as well as exemplary efficiency 
have contributed to making BMW diesel engines an attractive as 
well as future-oriented drive technology. 

This technology is now being made available to drivers in North 
America. BMW is introducing this diesel technology to the USA 
and Canada under the name "BMW Advanced Diesel with Blue 
Performance". 



The introduction is an integral part of the Efficient Dynamics 
development strategy, which has become a synonym for extremely 
low CO 2 emissions - not surprising when considering its extremely 
low fuel consumption. 

Efficient Dynamics is not solely an instrument for reducing fuel 
consumption, but rather it is designed as an intelligent entity with 
increased dynamics. Not without good reason, the M57D30T2 
engine is referred to as the world's most agile diesel engine. 


In the 2008 International Engine of the Year Awards, the BMW 
diesel came in second in the 2.5 to 3.0 liter category. Surprisingly, 
the M57D30T2 engine finished second only to the gasoline 
powered N54 engine. 

But, both the N54 and M57 diesel engines finished well ahead of 
the competition which included diesel engines from other manu¬ 
facturers. 



The following pages contain a comparison of the new BMW diesel 
engine technology to the current BMW gasoline engine technology.

Diesel vs. N52 



M57D30T2 (335d, X5 XDrive35d) 


N52B30O1 (X5 3. Osi) 


Diesel vs. N54 



The following full load diagrams provide a comparison of the new 
diesel engine to the current production gasoline engines, both 6 
and 8 cylinder. 

Most notably, the diesel has the advantage in the torgue output. 
The above comparison shows a comparison between the N52 
engine, which is a naturally aspirated 3-liter gasoline engine. 

The power developed by the gasoline engine is carried over a 
broader RPM range, but the diesel has more output torgue which is 
available at a much lower engine speed. 


In the above graph, the N54 has a slight advantage in peak output 
with regard to horsepower. Since the N54 is a turbocharged 
engine, the output torgue figures show the torgue output at a lower 
engine speed, but it is guite “flat” up to almost 5000 RPM. 

In contrast, the diesel has a much higher torgue output, but is only 
available for a short time. After about 2400 RPM, the torgue drops 
off considerably. 

























































Comparison to the V8 Engine 



M57D30T2 (335d, X5 XDrive35d) N62B4801 (X5 4.8i) 

The familiar N62B4801 has impressive horsepower output but, 
even with 8-cylinders, it does not have the torque output of the 
M57 diesel engine. 

Overall, these engine output graphs illustrate that the diesel has 
very specific characteristics especially with regard to torque output. 

Vehicles with diesel engines are adapted to suit these torque 
characteristics with an upgraded torque converter and a rear axle 
gear ratio which allows the full utilization of the output curve. 

In short, the new BMW diesel engine exceeds all of the currently 
available gasoline engines up to an engine speed of about 4000 
rpm.

Engine Mechanical 


Engine Mechanical Changes 

For the US market, several changes were incorporated into the 
M57 engine. Some of the components affected include: 

• Bearings (crankshaft and connecting rod) 

• Pistons 

• Crankcase 

• Crankcase ventilation 

Bearings 

The connecting rod bearings are 
now lead-free. The familiar sputter 
bearing arrangement is still used. 

The upper (con rod side) bearing is 
a 3-layer sputter bearing. The cap 
side is a 2-layer non-sputter bear¬ 
ing. 

The crankshaft main bearings are 
still the conventional 3-layer (lead- 
based) bearings. 

Future engine designs will use completely “lead-free” bearings. 

Pistons 

The piston pin has a greater offset than in the European version. 
The offset of the piston pin means that the piston pin is slightly off 
center. 

This provides acoustic advantages during changes in piston 
contact. The acoustic advantages of increasing the offset are 
further developed particularly at idle speed. 



Crankcase 

In contrast to the European version, the M57D30T2 US engine 
has a larger reinforcement panel on the underside of the 
crankcase. 

The reinforcement panel now covers four of the main bearing 
blocks for the crankshaft. In principle, the reinforcement panel 
serves to enhance the stability of the crankcase. 


Note: Never drive the vehicle without the reinforcement panel. 




However, the enlargement was realized solely for acoustic 
reasons. 





Crankcase Vent 

The crankcase vent in the US version is heated. In addition, the 
operation of the crankcase breather is OBD monitored. This is 
because a leaking system would increase unwanted emissions. 


© © ® © © 



The only probable reason for a leak in the system would be that the 
blow-by pipe is not connected to the cylinder head cover. In order 
to facilitate protection of this situation by the OBD, the heating line 
is routed via a connector to the cylinder head cover (2). 

Essentially, this connector serves only as a bridge so that actuation 
of the heating system is looped through. The plug connection is 
designed in such a way that correct contact is made only when the 
blow-by pipe has been connected correctly to the cylinder head 
cover, i.e. the contact for the heating system is not closed if the 
blow-by pipe is not connected to the cylinder head cover. The 
OBD system recognizes this situation as a fault. 

Note: If the blow-by pipe is not connected to the cylinder 
head correctly, the OBD will activate the MIL 
(Malfunction Indicator Lamp). 

Note: 

When making repairs which concern malfunctions of the 
crankcase ventilation system. Or, if any repairs are made to a 
turbocharger which has leaked oil into the engine, be sure to 
remove any residual oil in the intake air system. 

Failure to do so may result in an engine over-rev situation 
causing irreparable engine damage. In this case, the warranty 
may be affected.

Summary of Changes for the M57D30T2 (US) 

The following table provides an overview of the special features of the M57D30T2 US engine. They are divided into various categories. 

• New development signifies a technology that has not previously been used on BMW engines. 

• Modification signifies a component that was specifically designed for the M57D30T2 US engine but does not represent a technical 
innovation. 

• Adopted describes a component that has already been used in other BMW engines. 

This information describes only the main modifications to the M57D30T2 engine compared to the European version as well as funda¬ 
mental vehicle systems specific to diesel engines.

Very few modifications have been made to 
the basic engine. The modifications that 
have been made focus mainly on ensuring 
smooth engine operation. 

A significant feature, however, is the OBD 
monitoring of the crankcase breather. 

Air intake and exhaust systems 

X 



The most extensive changes were made to 
the air intake and exhaust system. For 
instance, low pressure exhaust gas 
recirculation (low pressure EGR) is used for 
the first time at BMW on the E70. 

In addition to other minor adaptations, there 
are substantial differences in the sensor and 
actuator systems. 

Cooling system 


X 


In principle, the cooling system corresponds 
to that of the European versions, however, it 
has been adapted to hot climate requirements.

New Development 

Modification 

Adopted 

Remarks 

High pressure fuel system 


X 


The functional principle of the fuel 
preparation system does not differ from that 
of the European version, however, individual 
components have been adapted to the 
different fuel specification. 

Fuel supply system 



X 

The fuel supply system is vehicle-specific 
and corresponds to the European version. 

There are, however, significant differences to 
petrol engine vehicles. 

Selective Catalytic Reduction System (SCR) 

X 



The SCR system is used for the first time at BMW. 
Nitrogen oxide emissions are drastically reduced by the use of 
a reducing agent that is injected into the exhaust system 
upstream of a special SCR catalytic converter. 

Since the reducing agent is carried in the vehicle, a supply 
facility, made up of two reservoirs, is part of this system 

Engine electrical system 



X 

The engine is equipped with the new DDE7 
(digital diesel electronics) control unit that will 
be used in the next generation diesel engines (N57). 

The preheater (glow plug) system also corresponds to the 
N57 engines. 

Automatic transmission 



X 

The automatic transmission corresponds to that in the ECE 
variant of the X5 xDrive35d. The gearbox itself has already 
been used in the US version of theX5 4.8i, however, a 
different torque converter is used for the diesel model.

Vehicle Specific Diesel Changes 


Diesel Vehicles for the US Market 

Aside from the engine itself, there are several changes which have 
been made to the diesel versions of the 335d and X5. These 
changes are reguired to successfully adapt the diesel engine. 

These changes are as follows: 

• Transmission 

• Rear differential 

• Cooling system 

• Climate control system (auxiliary PTC heater) 

• Acoustic package 

Transmission 

In view of the high torgue developed by the M57D30T2 engine, 
the GA6HP26TU gearbox is used, which is normally fitted behind 
8-cylinder gasoline engines. 

The transmission gear ratios have not been changed. 



Twin Damper Torque Converter 

The gearbox is identical to that used in the X5 4.8i; only the torgue 
converter is different. 

A so-called turbine torsional damper (TTD) is used while a twin 
damper torgue converter is used for diesel engines. 

In principle, the twin damper torgue converter is a turbine torsional 
damper with a further damper connected upstream. The primary 
side of the first damper is connected to the converter lockup 
clutch while the secondary side is connected to the primary side 
of the second damper. As in the turbine torsional damper, the 
secondary side is fixed to the turbine wheel of the torgue 
converter. 

When the converter lockup clutch is open, the power flow is egual 
to that of the turbine torsional damper. The power is transferred 
from the turbine wheel via the second damper (but without damp¬ 
ing) to the transmission input shaft. 

When the converter lockup clutch is closed, the power is transmit¬ 
ted via the first damper that consists of an annular spring. 

From here the power is transmitted to the second damper which 
operationally corresponds to the turbine torsional damper and also 
consists of two annular springs. 

These further improved damping properties effectively adapt the 
transmission to the operational irregularities of the diesel engine.

In order to optimize the torque curve of the diesel engine, the 
differential ratio has been changed in the final drive. The ratio is 
now numerically lower which keep the RPM to an optimum level. 
The following charts show the comparisons of the transmission 
and final drive ratios between the gasoline and diesel versions.

Cooling System 

The cooling system, is in part, vehicle-specific. In principle, there 
are scarcely any differences between the cooling systems on petrol 
and diesel engines. 

The two basic differences compared to a gasoline engine are: 

• No characteristic map thermostat 

• Addition of EGR cooler (LP and HP EGR). 

The E70 and E90 differ with regard to the EGR cooler. Since the 
E70 is eguipped with a low pressure EGR system, it has a second 
EGR cooler, the low pressure EGR cooler.

Cooling Method 

The cylinder head varies according to the engineering used to 
implement the cooling concept. 

There are 3 types of cooling concepts: 

• Crossflow cooling 

• Longitudinal flow cooling 

• Combination of the two. 

In BMW diesel engines only crossflow cooling is used. With cross- 
flow cooling, the coolant flows from the hot exhaust side of the 
cylinder head to the cooler inlet side. 


This offers the advantage of even heat distribution throughout the 
cylinder head. By contrast, with longitudinal flow cooling, the 
coolant flows lengthways along the cylinder head, in other words 
from one end to the other. 

As the coolant flows past each cylinder in succession, it becomes 
progressively hotter, resulting in very uneven heat distribution. 

This also causes pressure losses in the coolant circulation system. 

A combination of both systems cannot outweigh the disadvantages 
of longitudinal flow cooling. Conseguently, BMW diesel engines 
exclusively use crossflow cylinder head cooling.

Climate Control for Diesel Vehicles 

The climate control system on the diesel vehicles is mostly identi¬ 
cal to those on vehicles with gasoline engines. The major addition 
to the system is an electric auxiliary PTC heater. Both the E70 and 
E90 use an auxiliary PTC heater. 

Since diesel engines are more thermally efficient than gasoline 
engines, the warmup time is increased. This can potentially cause 
a “comfort” related issue for the customer. So, this heater is need¬ 
ed to “boost” the output of the heater core until the coolant 
temperature is sufficient to provide the necessary heating. 

The PTC heater does not heat the coolant, but rather the air pass¬ 
ing through the heater core. The electric auxiliary heater is installed 
in the IHKA housing next to the heater core. 

This is connected to the IHKA via the LIN bus and is controlled 
between 0 - 100% when heating is required (infinitely variable). 

The electric PTC auxiliary heater may only be operated using 
excess alternator power. 

The power consumption can be limited via the DDE using power 
management. Notification of power availability is provided by the 
DDE via a CAN signal on the vehicle circuit and relayed to the 
electric PTC auxiliary heater by the IHKA via the LIN bus. 

The output of the electric PTC auxiliary heater is 1250 W at a 
voltage of 13 V. The electric auxiliary heater consists of a heating 
grid and integrated actuation electronics. 

The PTC heater has the following characteristics: 

• Ceramic heating elements (PTC ceramic resistors) 

• Access to air via metal grilles 

• Actuation electronics.

• Terminal 15 

• Generator load signal (PWM) 

• LIN bus. 

The electric PTC auxiliary heater has diagnostic capability for 
detecting faults such as: 

• Missing contact 

• Short circuit to ground and B+ 

The electronic system performs continuous self-diagnosis. This 
makes it possible to activate internal safety functions and make the 
diagnostic data available to the IHKA control unit via the LIN bus. 

The following items have diagnostic capability: 

• Presence of power supply, terminal 15 and power supply 
voltage measurement 

• Power output stage fault 

The following safety functions are provided with the aid of 
self-diagnosis: 

• PTC shut-off if the permitted operating voltage range is 
exceeded.

Diesel Engine Management 


In contrast to the ECE version of the M57D30T2 engine, the US 
version of the engine electrical system features following 
differences: 

• Engine control unit DDE7.3 

• Preheating system with LIN-bus link and ceramic heater 
plugs 

• Additional OBD sensors 

• Electrically operated swirl flap and EGR valve 

• Additional actuators and sensors for the low pressure EGR 
system. 

Engine Control Module 

The new DDE7.3 engine control module is used on the US 
version M57D30T2 engine. The DDE 7 version is used due to 
the fact that the DDE 6 engine control module was not sufficient 
to accommodate the addition of the SCR system as well as addi¬ 
tional OBD functions. 

DDE 7 will be used on future generations of diesel engines 
including the N57 which will be available sometime later. 




Sensors and Actuators 

In the M57D30T2 US engine, the modifications to the sensors and 
actuators are restricted to the air intake and exhaust system. 

Several new components have been added to this system. 

The table below provides an overview. It shows a comparison 
between the E70 US and E90 US and the ECE variant (EUR04).

OBD Monitored Functions 

The engine management has the additional task of monitoring all 
exhaust-relevant systems to ensure they are functioning correctly. 
This task is known as On Board Diagnosis (OBD). 

The malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) is activated if the onboard 
diagnosis registers a fault. The events specific to US diesel engines 
that cause the MIL to light up are described in the following. 

Diesel Oxidation Catalyst 

The oxidation catalytic converter is monitored with regard to its 
conversion ability which diminishes with aging. The conversion of 
hydrocarbons (HC) during cold start is used as the indicator as heat 
is produced as part of the chemical reaction and it follows a defined 
temperature progression after the oxidation catalytic converter. 

The exhaust gas temperature sensor after the oxidation catalytic 
converter measures the temperature. The DDE maps the tempera¬ 
ture progression during cold start and compares it to calculated 
models. The result determines how effective the oxidation catalytic 
converter is operating. 

A reversible fault is stored if the temperature progression drops 
below a predetermined value. If this fault is still determined after 
two successive diesel particulate filter regeneration cycles, an 
irreversible fault is stored and the MIL is activated. 

SCR Catalytic Converter 

The effectiveness of the SCR catalytic converter is monitored by 
the two NO x sensors. The nitrogen mass is measured before and 
after the SCR catalytic converter and a sum is formed over a 
defined period of time. The actual reduction is compared with a 
calculated value that is stored in the DDE. 


The following conditions must be met for this purpose: 

• NO x sensors plausible 

• Metering active 

• Ambient temperature in defined range 

• Ambient pressure in defined range 

• Regeneration of diesel particulate filter not active 

• SCR catalytic converter temperature in defined range 

(is calculated by means of exhaust temperature sensor before 
SCR catalytic converter) 

• Flow of exhaust gas in defined range. 

Monitoring involves four measuring cycles. A reversible fault is 
stored if the actual value is lower than the calculated value. If the 
fault is determined in two successive driving cycles, an irreversible 
fault is stored and the MIL is activated. 

Long-term adaptation is implemented, where the metered quantity 
of urea-water solution is adapted, to ensure the effectiveness of the 
SCR catalytic converter over a long period of time. To execute this 
adaptation procedure, the signal of the NO x sensor after the SCR 
catalytic converter is compared with a calculated value. If variations 
occur, the metered quantity is correspondingly adapted in the short 
term. 

The adaptations are evaluated and a correction factor is applied to 
the metered quantity. 

The operating range for the long-term adaptation is the same as 
that for effectiveness monitoring. 

A reversible fault is stored if the correction factor exceeds a defined 
threshold. If the fault is determined in two successive driving 
cycles, an irreversible fault is stored and the MIL is activated. 



Supplying Urea-water Solution 

A supply of a urea-water solution is required to ensure efficient 
operation of the SCR catalytic converter. 

Once the SCR catalytic converter has reached a certain tempera¬ 
ture (calculated by the exhaust gas temperature sensor before the 
SCR catalytic converter), the metering control system attempts to 
build up pressure in the metering line. 

For this purpose, the metering module must be closed and the 
delivery pump actuated at a certain speed for a defined period of 
time. 

If the defined pressure threshold cannot be reached within a certain 
time, the metering module is opened in order to vent the metering 
line. This is followed by a new attempt to build up pressure. 

A reversible fault is stored if a defined number of pressure build-up 
attempts remain unsuccessful. If the fault is determined in two 
successive driving cycles, an irreversible fault is stored and the MIL 
is activated. 

This monitoring takes place only once per driving cycle before 
metering begins. Continuous pressure monitoring begins after this 
monitoring run was successful. 

A constant pressure of the urea-water solution (5 bar) is required 
for the selective catalytic reduction process. The actual pressure is 
measured by the pressure sensor in the delivery module and 
compared with a minimum and a maximum pressure threshold. 

A reversible fault is stored if the limits are exceeded for a certain 
time. If the fault is determined in two successive driving cycles, an 
irreversible fault is stored and the MIL is activated. 

This monitoring run takes place while metering is active. 


Level Measurement in Active Reservoir 

A level sensor with three contacts at different heights is used for 
the active reservoir. The plausibility of the sensor is checked in the 
evaluator in that it checks whether the signals are logical. 

For example, it is improbable that the "Full" contact is covered by 
the solution while the "Empty" contact is not. In this case, the 
evaluator sends a plausibility error to the DDE. This takes place at 
a pulse duty factor of 30% of the PWM signal. A reversible fault is 
set. If the fault is determined in two successive driving cycles, an 
irreversible fault is stored and the MIL is activated. 

This monitoring procedure only takes place if the temperature in 
the active reservoir is above a defined value. 

If the line between the evaluator and at least one contact of the 
level sensor is interrupted, the fault is signalled to the DDE by a 
PWM signal with 40% pulse duty factor. A reversible fault is set. 

If the fault is determined in two successive driving cycles, an irre¬ 
versible fault is stored and the MIL is activated. 

Suitable Urea-water Solution 

The SCR system is monitored with regard to refilling with an incor¬ 
rect medium. This monitoring function starts when refilling is 
detected. Refilling detection is described in the section on the 
SCR system. 

Effectiveness monitoring of the SCR catalytic converter is used for 
the purpose of determining whether an incorrect medium has been 
used. An incorrect medium is detected if the effectiveness drops 
below a certain value within a defined period of time after refilling. 

A reversible fault is set in this case. If the fault is determined in two 
successive driving cycles, an irreversible fault is stored and the MIL 
is activated. 

In addition, the warning scenario with a remaining range of 200 mis 
is started.

NO x Sensors 

A dew point must be reached for effective operation and therefore 
also the monitoring of the NO x sensor. This ensures that there is 
no longer any water in the exhaust system that could damage the 
NO x sensors. 

A reversible fault is set if the following monitoring functions detect a 
fault at the NO x sensor. If the fault is determined in two successive 
driving cycles, an irreversible fault is stored and the MIL is activat¬ 
ed. 

• Detection signal or correction factor incorrect 

• Line break or short-circuit between measuring probe and con¬ 
trol unit of NO x sensor 

• Measured value outside the defined range for a certain period 
of time 

• Operating temperature is not reached after a defined heating 
time 

• The distance from the measured value to zero is too great in 
overrun mode (no nitrogen oxides expected) 

• During the transition from load to overrun mode, the signal of 
the NO x sensor does not drop fast enough from 80% to 50% 
(only NO x sensor before SCR catalytic converter) 


Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) 

During normal operation, the exhaust gas recirculation is controlled 
based on the EGR ratio. During regeneration of the diesel particu¬ 
late filter, it is conventionally controlled based on the air mass. 

The monitoring function also differs in this way: During normal 
operation a fault is detected when the EGR ratio is above or below 
defined limits fora certain period of time. 

This applies to the air mass during regeneration of the diesel par¬ 
ticulate filter. In order to monitor the high pressure EGR cooler, the 
temperature after the high pressure EGR cooler is measured with 
the bypass valve open and close with the engine running at idle 
speed. A fault is detected if the temperature difference is below a 
certain value. 

For the low pressure EGR cooler (only E70), the measured temper¬ 
ature after the low pressure EGR cooler is compared with a calcu¬ 
late temperature for this position. A fault is detected if the differ¬ 
ence exceeds a certain value. 

Each of these faults is stored reversible. If the fault is determined in 
two successive driving cycles, an irreversible fault is stored and the 
MIL is activated. 


• If, despite a peak in the signal of the NO x sensor before the 
SCR catalytic converter, at least a defined change in the signal 
of the NO x sensor after the SCR catalytic converter is not 
determined this is interpreted as implausible. 



Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) 

The diesel particulate filter is monitored by means of the differential 
pressure sensor. If the filter is defective, the differential pressure 
before and after the filter will be lower than for a new filter. 

Monitoring starts when the flow of exhaust gas and the diesel 
particulate filter temperature exceed certain values. A fault is 
detected when the differential pressure drops below a defined 
threshold fora certain period of time. 

Conversely, an overloaded/clogged diesel particulate filter is detect¬ 
ed when the differential pressure exceeds a defined value for a 
certain period of time. 

When regeneration of the diesel particulate filter is started, the time 
required until the exhaust temperature before the DPF reaches 
250°C is measured. This time is set to zero if the engine runs for a 
longer period of time at idle speed or in overrun mode. A fault is 
detected if a defined time is exceeded before the temperature of 
250°C is reached. 

In this way, the response characteristics of the increase in exhaust 
temperature for DPF regeneration are monitored. 

The system also monitors whether the exhaust gas temperature 
before the diesel particulate filter corresponds to the expected 
value after a defined period of time. If this is not the case although 
the control system has reached its limits, a fault is detected. 

Also in this case, each of these faults is stored reversible. If the fault 
is determined in two successive driving cycles, an irreversible fault 
is stored and the MIL is activated.

Swirl Flaps 

The US version of the M57 engine utilizes the previously known swirl flaps which are located in the intake manifold. The primary differ¬ 
ence is that the swirl flaps are now controlled electrically, rather than with vacuum. This method of actuation also provides a means of 
position feedback with the DDE system to comply with OBD requirements. An additional benefit of this method of control is a more 
precise positioning of the swirl flaps as needed. The flaps are map controlled using engine speed, engine load and coolant temperature.

Fuel System 


Fuel Supply Overview 


As with current gasoline fuel injection systems, there is an electric 
fuel pump located in the fuel tank. The fuel pump supplies the 
needed low pressure fuel to feed the mechanical high-pressure 
pump.

Electric fuel pump module (EKP) 


The fuel tank is eguipped with two chambers and, on modern 
vehicles, is made from plastic. The electric fuel pump on the 
diesel engines is driven by the EKP module. 

Similar to BMW gasoline engines, the fuel system on the vehicles 
eguipped with diesel engines share much of the same “low pres¬ 
sure” system components. 

However, there are some distinct differences with the diesel 
engine. 

These are: 

• The system includes a fuel return line 

• The breather system is significantly simpler 

• There is no carbon canister (AKF) and no fuel 
tank leakage diagnosis module (DMTL) 

• There is no pressure regulator 

• The fuel filter is not located in the fuel tank. 

The design layout of the fuel supply systems in the E70 and E90 
are described in the following. 

















Fuel Tank 

As with all modern BMW vehicles, the fuel tank is made from 
plastic and is installed in the optimum position to achieve the best 
possible weight balance in the vehicle. 

To accommodate these needs, the fuel tanks must be designed in 
such a way so that there is room for the driveshaft to pass through 
with out interference. 

So, the fuel tanks in the diesel vehicles feature the familiar “double¬ 
chamber” configuration. This design feature accommodates two 
delivery units which are located in the right and left fuel tank halves. 

The fuel pump (3) with intake filter (2) is a part of the right-hand 
delivery unit. The surge chamber including a suction jet pump (10) 
with pressure relief valve (11) and initial fill valve (1) as well as a 
lever-type sensor (G) complete this delivery unit. 

The suction jet pump (8), lever-type sensor (G), leak prevention 
valve (7) and air inlet valve (9) belong to the left-hand delivery unit. 

A line leads from the filler vent valve (H) to the filter (L). The fuel filler 
pipe is connected to this line via the non-return valve (K).

Fuel Tank Functions 

A pressure relief valve (B) is integrated in the fuel filler cap (A) to 
protect the fuel tank (E) from excess pressure. A non-return flap (C) 
is located at the end of the fuel filler neck. 

The non-return flap prevents the fuel from sloshing back into the 
fuel filler neck. The components in the fuel tank can be reached 
via the two service caps (F). The fuel fill level can be determined via 
the two lever-type sensors (G). The surge chamber (D) ensures that 
the fuel pump always has enough fuel available for delivery.

Fuel Delivery from Fuel Tank 

In the event of the surge chamber being completely empty, the 
initial filling valve (1) ensures that fuel enters the surge chamber 
while refuelling. 

The fuel reaches the fuel pump (3) via the intake filter (2), then 
continues through the delivery line (5) to the fuel filter. The fuel 
pump is located in the surge chamber. A pressure relief valve (4) is 
integrated in the fuel pump to prevent pressure in the delivery line 
from rising too high.

cannot run dry because, provided the system is not leaking, no air 
is able to enter it. In addition, after the fuel pump has switched off, 
the fuel pressure/temperature sensor is checked for plausibility. 

Fuel that is required for lubrication and the function of high pres¬ 
sure generation flows back into the fuel tank via the return line (7). 
The fuel coming from the return line is divided into two lines down¬ 
stream of the leak prevention valve (7). The non-return valve 
prevents the fuel tank from draining in the event of damage to lines 
on the engine or underbody. It also prevents the return line from 
running dry while the engine is off. 

One of the lines guides the fuel into the surge chamber via a suc¬ 
tion jet pump (10). The suction jet pump transports the fuel from 
the fuel tank into the surge chamber. If the fuel delivery pressure in 
the return line increases too much, the pressure relief valve (11) 
opens and allows the fuel to flow directly into the surge chamber. 

An air inlet valve is used in the E70. The air inlet valve (9) ensures 
that air can enter the line when the engine is off, preventing fuel 
from flowing back from the right-hand half of the fuel tank to the 
left. 

Instead of the air inlet valve (9) a non-return valve is used on the 
E90. The non-return valve ensures that, while the engine is off, 
fuel from the right-hand half of the fuel tank cannot flow back into 
the left-hand half. The return system remains completely filled with 
fuel. 

A further line branches off into the left-hand half of the fuel tank 
after the non-return valve (7) and transports the fuel into the surge 
chamber via the suction jet pump (8).

Air Supply and Extraction 

Fuel ventilation is ensured by means of the filler vent valve (H). 

The filler vent valve is located in the fuel tank and uses the connec¬ 
tion (I) to determine the maximum fill level (J). The filler vent valve 
contains a float that buoys upwards on the fuel when the vehicle is 
refuelled and blocks the filler ventilation. The fuel rises in the fuel 
filler and the fuel nozzle switches off. 

A roll-over valve is also integrated in the filler vent valve to block the 
ventilation line when a certain angle of incline is reached and 
prevents fuel from draining out if the vehicle were to roll over. 


The filter (L) prevents dirt or insects from entering the ventilation 
and blocking the line. 

If the ventilation line does become blocked, fuel consumption 
during operation would cause negative pressure and the fuel tank 
would be compressed and damaged. 

Fuel Filler Cap 

The fuel filler cap contains a pressure relief valve to ensure that, if 
there is a problem with fuel tank ventilation, any excess pressure 
that may form can escape and the fuel tank is not damaged. 


The non-return valve (K) prevents fuel from escaping via the venti¬ 
lation when the vehicle is refuelled. During operation, air can flow 
into the fuel filler pipe and the fuel can flow from the fuel filler pipe 
into the tank.

If excess pressure forms in the fuel tank, this causes the valve head 
(1) and with it the entire pressure relief valve (5) to be lifted off the 
sealed housing (6). The excess pressure can now escape into the 
atmosphere. The excess pressure spring (2) determines the 
opening pressure. 

The excess pressure spring uses a defined pressure to push the 
pressure relief valve onto the sealed housing and is supported by 
the brace (3).

Misfueling Protection 

A mechanical system has been developed in order to help prevent 
a mis-fueling situation. To make sure that the diesel vehicles are 
only refueled with the proper diesel fuel, a mechanical flap has 
been added to the fuel filler neck. 



As the following illustrations show, only a fuel nozzle with a diame¬ 
ter of approximately 24 mm can fit. If the diameter is approximately 
21 mm, the flap (4) does not open as the hinged lever (7) and the 
locking lever (2) cannot be pushed apart. 

If a diesel fuel nozzle is inserted, this pushes the locking lever (2) 
and the hinged lever (7) at the same time. The hinged lever is 
pushed outwards against the tension spring (3) and releases the 
flap (4). This is only possible, however, if the hinged lever cannot 
move freely and is also locked in position by the fuel nozzle. 

To open the protection against incorrect refuelling feature in the 
workshop, a special tool is reguired.

Fuel Pump 

Today's diesel vehicles are fitted with electric fuel pumps to deliver 
the needed fuel to the high pressure pump. The electric fuel pump 
is designed to deliver a sufficient amount of fuel to lubricate and 
cool the injectors and the high-pressure pump and to satisfy the 
maximum fuel consumption of the engine. 

It has to deliver the fuel at a defined pressure. That means that 
when the engine is idling or running at medium power, the fuel 
pump delivers several times more than the amount of fuel required. 
The fuel pump delivers approximately three or four times the 
volume of maximum possible fuel consumption. 



The electric fuel pump is located in the fuel tank. There it is well 
protected against corrosion and the pump noise is adequately 
soundproofed. 

The fuel pump on BMW diesel engines may either be a gear 
pump, a roller-cell pump or a screw-spindle pump. The following 
fuel pumps are used on USA vehicles: 

• E70 - Screw spindle pump 

• E90 - Gear pump (rotor type) 

The operating principle of each of these types of pump is 
described below. The pump itself is driven by the drive shaft (2) of 
the electric motor (3). The electric motor is controlled by the 
electrical connection (6) and sliding contacts (7). 

Passing first through the intake filter and then the remainder of the 
intake section (9), the fuel enters the impeller (1). The fuel is 
pumped through pressure chamber (8) on the electric motor, past 
the pressure connection (5) and onwards to the fuel filter and 
engine. 

If the fuel delivery pressure increases to an impermissible value, the 
pressure relief valve (4) opens and allows the fuel to flow into the 
surge chamber.

Fuel Pump - E90 

On the E90, the fuel pump is a gear type pump. The gear pump is 
comprised of an outer rotor (1) with teeth on the inside, and an 
inner rotor (4) with teeth on the outside. The inner rotor is driven 
by the drive shaft (5) of the electric motor. The outer rotor is pro¬ 
pelled by the teeth of the inner rotor and thus turns inside the 
pump housing. 

The inner rotor has one tooth fewer than the outer rotor, which 
means that, with each revolution, fuel is carried into the next tooth 
gap of the outer rotor. 

During the rotary motion, the spaces on the intake side enlarge, 
while those on the pressure side become proportionately smaller. 
The fuel is fed into the rotor pump through two grooves in the 
housing, one on the intake side and one on the pressure side. 
Together with the tooth gaps, these grooves form the intake 
section (6) and pressure section (3).

Screw-spindle Pump - E70 

With the screw-spindle pump, two screw spindles intermesh in 
such a way that the flanks form a seal with each other and the 
housing. In the displacement chambers between the housing and 
the spindles, the fuel is pushed towards the pressure side with 
practically no pulsation. 

In this way, the screw spindles pump fuel away from the fuel tank 
(5). The fuel is then fed to the engine (3) through the pump 
housing and the fuel delivery line.

Low Pressure Fuel System - E90 

The low pressure fuel systems differ between the E70 and E90. 
The E90 is a “speed regulated” system which means that the fuel 
pump speed is regulated by the EKP module based on request 
from the DDE. 

The fuel pump will be activated with the “ignition on” signal. If the 
engine is not started, the fuel pump will be switched off after a 
defined time period. When the engine is switched off, the fuel 
pump is switched off as well. 

Fuel Temperature Sensor 

The fuel temperature sensor is Fuel temperature sensor - E90 
located in the fuel feed line just 
before the high pressure pump. 

The sensor consists of a tem¬ 
perature dependent resistor 
with which works on the NTC 
principle. 

The fuel temperature sensor 
registers the fuel temperature 
just before the high pressure 
pump. The fuel temperature sen¬ 
sor is installed on the low pres¬ 
sure side of the fuel 
system. 

The density of the fuel changes as temperature changes. The DDE 
requires the fuel temperature for the purpose of precisely calculat¬ 
ing the start of injection and injection quantity. 

The fuel temperature sensor consists of a temperature-dependent 
measuring resistor made from semiconductor material that is inte¬ 
grated in a housing. The measuring resistor has a negative 
temperature coefficient (NTC). 


The digital diesel electronics compares the measured voltage with 
a characteristic curve that assigns a corresponding temperature to 
each voltage value. 

The various sensors and actuators are required for ensuring 
effective operation of the fuel system and engine. Apart from 
ensuring compliance with legal requirements, these components 
are also responsible for providing outstanding engine performance 
and the associated acoustics. 



Fuel Filter Heating - E90 

On the E90, the fuel filter heater is not controlled directly by the 
DDE. A pressure switch and a temperature sensor are located in 
the fuel filter housing. 

The fuel heater only works with the ignition switched on and when 
both of the following conditions are fulfilled: 

• Temperature drops below a defined value 

• A defined fuel delivery pressure is exceeded due to cold, 
viscous fuel. 

If the filter is clogged, a corresponding signal is sent via a diagnosis 
line to the DDE. This is the case when, despite a sufficiently high 
temperature, the fuel pressure upstream of the filter does not drop. 

The conditions for fuel filter heater operation are as follows: 

• The fuel heater is is switched ON when - the fuel pressure is 
greater than 6 bar AND the fuel temperature is less than 2°C. 

• The fuel heater is switched off when - the fuel pressure is less 
than 5.5 bar for a duration of greater than 5 minutes OR 

• the fuel temperature is greater than 12°C OR 

• during the starting process if the electronics in the fuel filter 
detect a battery voltage of less than 7.5 V for longer than 0.2 
seconds. 

The fuel heater is not activated by the DDE control module. 
However, the fuel heater reports a detected filter blockage via the 
signal DIAG_DKH to the DDE control module. The DDE control 
module then stores the fault.

Low Pressure Fuel System - E70 

The low pressure fuel system on the E70 is a “pressure regulated” 
system which uses the signal from the fuel pressure sensor located 
in the low pressure fuel line. 

The fuel pump operates with "ignition ON". If the engine is not 
started, the fuel is switched off at a specific pressure. When the 
engine is running, the fuel pump is regulated on-demand by the 
EKP module in response to a load signal from the DDE in order to 
ensure a uniform fuel pressure at the inlet to the high-pressure 
pump. 

The functions of the low pressure fuel system are integrated into 
the DDE control module. The DDE uses the pressure information 
from the combined fuel pressure-temperature sensor to determine 
the current actual pressure in the low pressure system. 

In order to maintain the approximate delivery pressure of 4.8 to 5.0 
bar, the DDE uses a number of input variables. The input variables 
relevant to determining the adjusting value are: 

• Actual pressure in the pre-supply system 

• Engine speed 

• Injection volume 

The adjusting value is sent from the DDE to the EKP module in the 
form of a CAN message. 

Fuel Pressure-temperature Sensor 

The fuel pressure-temperature sensor consists of two independent 
sensors combined in one housing. 

The fuel temperature sensor is reguired to precisely calculate the 
start of injection and injection quantity. The fuel pressure sensor 
registers the fuel pressure upstream of the high pressure pump. 
This fuel pressure is required for the purpose of controlling the fuel 
pump in the fuel tank. 


The fuel pump is also switched off when the engine is turned off 
and the fuel feed is depressurized. After the fuel pump has been 
shut down, the digital diesel electronics checks and evaluates the 
plausibility of the fuel pressure sensor. If a fault is detected, the 
corresponding fault code is stored in the fault code memory of the 
digital diesel electronics. 



The integrated fuel temperature sensor is identical to the fuel 
temperature sensor used in the E90. The fuel pressure sensor is 
also integrated in the housing. Both the fuel pressure sensor and 
the fuel temperature sensor features two separate connections in a 
common connector housing that has four pins. 

The fuel pressure sensor consists of resistors mounted on a 
diaphragm. The one side of the diaphragm has contact with the 
fuel so that the fuel pressure acts on the diaphragm. 

The greater the pressure, the more the diaphragm is deflected. 

The resistors on the diaphragm change their resistance in 
response to the mechanical stress. A bridge circuit and electronic 
signal processing circuitry in the sensor amplify the bridge voltage, 
compensate for temperature influences and linearize the pressure 
characteristic curve. 

The output voltage for the digital diesel electronics is in the range 
between 0 and 5 volts. As for the temperature sensor, a character¬ 
istic curve is stored in the digital diesel electronics that assigns a 
corresponding pressure to each voltage value. 


Fuel Filter Heating - E70 

The fuel filter heating operation is somewhat different in the E70. 
The E70 has a pressure-controlled fuel supply system. In this sys¬ 
tem, the fuel filter heater is actuated by the DDE. The DDE com¬ 
municates with the filter heater via the signal S_KSH. 

A combined fuel pressure and temperature sensor upstream of the 
high pressure pump is used. If reguired, the fuel filter is heated 
with an electrical heating element. The DDE switches the fuel filter 
heating on under the following conditions: 

• Temperature drops below a defined value 

• The reguired fuel pressure is not reached despite increased 
power intake of the electric fuel pump. 

The DDE recognizes a clogged filter when the target pressure 
upstream of the high pressure pump is not reached despite a 
sufficiently high fuel temperature and high current consumption of 
the electric fuel pump. 

The electrical power output of the fuel pump is higher than the 
stored adaptation value ’’electric fuel pump” plus an offset for more 
than 3 seconds. The offset is determined from a characteristic map 
and depends on the engine speed and fuel injection rate. 

The fuel filter heating is switched off again under the following con¬ 
ditions: 

• Activation time > 5 min or 

• Fuel temperature > 8°C or 

• Battery voltage is less than 9 volts for more than 30 seconds

High Pressure Fuel System 

The high pressure fuel system is mostly identical in design and 
function as compared to the European version. However, some 
components have been adapted to the different fuel specification. 


These components are: 

• High-pressure pump 

• Fuel rail 

• Fuel injectors. 

These adaptations are restricted to different coatings and materials 
on the inside.

Fuel Injectors 

Compared to a piezo fuel injector on a gasoline engine, the diesel 
injector operates guite differently. The concept of piezo electricity 
is the same, but applied in a different manner. 



On a gasoline engine, the piezo element is used to physically 
operate the injector pintle in an outward motion. Due to the very 
high pressures used in a diesel engine, the piezo element cannot 
be used to directly actuate the pintle. The pintle on a diesel fuel 
injector moves inward (away from the combustion chamber). 

Instead, the piezo element is used to trigger a relay valve in the 
actuator module. The injector is then hydraulically “imbalanced” 
which causes the pintle to open via the fuel rail pressure. 

The piezo-element (2) is located inside the actuator module (5). 
When controlled, it produces the movement necessary to open the 
relay valve. 

Circuited between the two elements is the coupler module (6), 
which functions as a hydraulic compensating element, e.g. to 
compensate for temperature-related length expansions. 

When the fuel injector is controlled, the actuator module expands. 
This movement is transferred to the relay valve (7) by the coupler 
module. When the relay valve opens, the pressure in the control 
chamber (1) drops and the nozzle needle opens. 

The benefits of the piezo-fuel injector are that they offer a consid¬ 
erably faster control response, which results in greater metering 
accuracy. In addition, the piezo-fuel injector is smaller, lighter and 
has a lower power consumption.

Injector Opening 

If the fuel injector is activated by the 
DDE, the piezo-element presses the 
control valve (2) down against the spring 
force via the coupler module (1) and 
closes the bypass (3). The fuel from the 
control volume (6) can then flow across 
the outlet (7) and the control valve. 

The pressure in the control 

volume drops and the nozzle needle (4) 

is opened by the fuel delivery pressure. 



Injector Closing 

If the injector current feed is set by the 
DDE, the piezo-element contracts and 
the coupler module is pressed back by 
the spring force. 

The spring in the control valve closes the 
valve and clears the bypass. Fuel now 
reaches the control volume via the 
bypass, outlet (7) and restrictor (5) and 
presses the nozzle needle down. The 
injector is closed and injection is finished. 






































Coupler Module 

The hydraulic coupler is surrounded by diesel fuel at a pressure of 
approximately 10 bar. The piezo-element acts on the upper 
plunger (1). 

Lower plunger (6) rests on control valve (9). The force of spring (7) 
and of spring (8) is set in such a way that, when closed, the piezo 
element and control valve (9) are connected free of play via the 
coupler module. 

The upper plunger (1) presses against coupler chamber (5) when 
the piezo-element is activated. 


The force of the piezo-element is increased since plunger (1) has a 
larger diameter than plunger (6). Plunger (6) opens the control 
valve (9). When the coupler chamber is pressurized during activa¬ 
tion, a small leakage guantity escapes via the clearance in the 
plunger guide into fuel return (2).

After injection or after the piezo-element has been switched off, the 
springs (7 and 8) balance out the play created by the leakage guan¬ 
tity and fuel is again drawn via the clearance in the piston guide 
into the coupler chamber. This balancing out process takes place 
so fast that the coupler chamber is completely filled again by the 
next injection cycle. 

A return pressure of approximately 10 bar is reguired for this 
purpose, which is achieved by the restrictor in the fuel return of the 
fuel injectors. The control valve is not operated and no fuel is 
injected when no pressure is applied in the fuel feed. 

Leakage Oil 

The piezo injectors reguire a certain amount of backpressure in the 
leakage circuit in order to operate properly. So, the leakage circuit 
on the 3rd generation common rail differs from the earlier versions. 

In past versions (such as 1st and 2nd generation common rail), the 
leakage oil circuit drained into the fuel return line. 

However, since the piezo injectors operate differently than the 
earlier solenoid valve injectors, the leakage circuit has been 
redesigned. 

A certain amount of leakage oil occurs in the diesel fuel injectors 
due to the design of the system. The reason for this is that the 
relay valve in the piezo-fuel injector needs a certain back pressure 
to work correctly. The relay valve requires about 10 bar to be pres¬ 
ent in the leakage circuit to prevent injector malfunctions. 

In order to maintain this pressure, a restrictor (11) has been 
installed between the injector(s) and the low pressure feed to the 
HP pump.

the fuel feed to the high pressure pump. 

There is a filter (2 and 4) on either side of restrictor (3) as the 
restrictor has no specific direction of flow. The filters ensure that 
the actual restrictor (3) does not become clogged. 














































































Fuel Injector Volume Adjustment 

Piezo-fuel injectors not only bear the hydraulic tolerances but also 
information concerning the stroke characteristics of the injector. 
This is a separate classification for the injector voltage calibration. 


This information is necessary due to the individual voltage reguire- 
ment of each fuel injector. The fuel injector is assigned to a voltage 
reguirement class. This replaces the seventh digit of the numerical 
combination on the injector for hydraulic adjustment. 


A piezo-fuel injector therefore has only six characters for the 
hydraulic adjustment (due to a more precise manufacture of the 
piezo-fuel injectors) and a seventh character for the injector voltage 
adjustment. 



Index 

Explanation

7 Character code for adjustment

Voltage adjustment 


Zero volume adaptation must be carried out on a continual basis 
due to the volume drift of the fuel injectors. 

At each cylinder, a small amount of fuel is injected during overrun 
mode. This volume continues to increase until a slight increase in 
engine speed is detected by the digital diesel electronics. 

The digital diesel electronic is thus able to detect when the respec¬ 
tive cylinder begins to work. The volume of fuel injected during 
zero volume adaptation is used by the digital diesel electronics as a 
value for the characteristic map of pre-injection. 

Zero volume adaptation takes place alternately from one cylinder to 
the next during the overrun phase at engine speeds from 1500 to 
2500 rpm and with the engine at operating temperature. 

Zero volume adaptation has no influence on fuel consumption as 
only very small guantity of fuel (about Imm^) is injected at one 
cylinder at a time. 


Volume Adjustment 

If the digital diesel electronics detects engine speed fluctuations, 
the actuation period of the fuel injectors is corrected based on 
these engine speed fluctuations. The volume adjustment adapts 
the injected volume of all cylinders with respect to each other. 

Zero Volume Adaptation 

The zero volume adaptation is a continual learning process. 

This learning process is reguired to enable precise pre-injection for 
each individual fuel injector. Accurate metering of the very low 
pre-injection volume is necessary for the fulfilment of exhaust 
emission regulations. 


Advanced Diesel Technology 

61 







62 

Advanced Diesel Technology 


Mean Volume Adaptation 

The mean volume (quantity) adaptation is a learning process in 
which the air/fuel ratio (lambda value) is corrected by the adjust¬ 
ment of the air mass or exhaust gas recirculation. Unlike the other 
processes, this process affects all fuel injectors equally rather than 
the individual fuel injector. 

An injection volume averaged across all cylinders is calculated from 
the lambda value measured by the oxygen sensor and the air mass 
measured by the hot-film air mass meter. This value is compared 
with the injection volume specified by the digital diesel electronics. 

If a discrepancy is detected, the air mass is adjusted to match the 
actual injection volume by an adjustment of the exhaust gas 
recirculating valve. The correct lambda value is set in turn. 

The mean volume adaptation is not an "instantaneous" regulation 
but an adaptive learning process. The injection volume error is 
taught into an adaptive characteristic map that is permanently 
stored in the EEPROM of the control unit. 

Replacing the following components will require a reset (clearance) 
of this mean volume adaptation characteristic map: 

• Hot-film air mass meter 

• Fuel injector(s) 

• Rail pressure sensor 

It is possible to reset the characteristic map with the BMW 
diagnosis system.

Diesel Emission Control Systems 


Legislation 

Since the first exhaust emission legislation for petrol engines came into force in the mid-1960s in California, the permissible limits for a 
range of pollutants have been further and further reduced. In the meantime, all industrial nations have introduced exhaust emission 
legislation that defines the emission limits for petrol and diesel engines as well as the test methods. 

Essentially, the following exhaust emission legislation applies: 

• CARB legislation (California Air Resources Board), California 

• ERA legislation (Environmental Protection Agency), USA 

• EU legislation (European Union) and corresponding ECE regulations (UN Economic Commission for Europe), Europe 

• Japan legislation. 

This legislation has lead to the development of different reguirements with regard to the limitation of various components in 
the exhaust gas. Essentially, the following exhaust gas constituents are evaluated: 

• Carbon monoxide (CO) 

• Nitrogen oxides (NO x ) 

• Hydrocarbons (HC) 

• Particulates (PM) 

It can generally be said that traditionally more emphasis is placed on low nitrogen oxide emissions in US legislation while in Europe the 
focus tends to be more on carbon monoxide. The following graphic compares the standard applicable to BMW diesel vehicles with the 
current standards in Europe. A direct comparison, however, is not possible as different measuring cycles are used and different values 
are measured for hydrocarbons. 

Although European and US standards cannot be compared 1:1 it is clear that reguirements relating to nitrogen oxide emissions are con¬ 
siderably more demanding in the US market. Diesel engines generally have higher nitrogen oxide emission levels than petrol engines as 
diesel engines are normally operated with excess air. For this reason, the challenge of achieving approval in all 50 states of the USA had 
to be met with a series of new technological developments.

Exhaust Gas Recirculation 

The recycling of exhaust gases is one of the methods used to 
reduce NO x in a diesel engine. By introducing exhaust gas into the 
intake stream, the amount of oxygen in the combustion chamber is 
reduced which results in lower combustion chamber temperatures. 

The EGR systems differ between the E70 and the E90. Both vehi¬ 
cles use the “high-pressure EGR”, but the E70 uses an additional 
“low-pressure EGR” system. The low pressure EGR system is 
required in the E70 due to it’s additional weight and higher opera¬ 
tional loads (i.e. towing etc.). 

Low Pressure EGR 

The known EGR system has been expanded by the low pressure 
EGR on the E70. This system offers advantages particularly at 
high loads and engine speeds. This is why it is used in the heavier 
E70 as it is often driven in the higher load ranges. 

The advantage is based on the fact that a higher total mass of 
exhaust gas can be recirculated. This is made possible for two 
reasons: 

• Lower exhaust gas temperature - The exhaust gas for the low 
pressure EGR is tapped off at a point where a lower tempera¬ 
ture prevails than in the high pressure EGR. Consequently, 
the exhaust gas has a higher density thus enabling a higher 
mass. 

In addition, the exhaust gas is added to the fresh intake air 
before the exhaust turbocharger, i.e. before the intercooler, 
where it is further cooled. The lower temperature of the total 
gas enables a higher EGR rate without raising the temperature 
in the combustion chamber. 


• Recirculation before the exhaust turbocharger - Unlike in the 
high pressure EGR where the exhaust gas is fed to the charge 
air already compressed, in this system the exhaust gas is 
added to the intake air before the exhaust turbocharger. 

A lower pressure prevails in this area under all operating condi¬ 
tions. 

This makes it possible to recirculate a large volume of exhaust 
gas even at higher engine speed and load whereas this is 
limited by the boost pressure in the high pressure EGR. 

Low pressure EGR system 














The following graphic shows the control of the EGR system with The low pressure EGR system is located on the right-hand side on 
low pressure EGR: the engine directly next to the diesel particulate filter and the low 

pressure stage of the turbo assembly. The exhaust gas is branched 
off directly after the diesel particulate filter and fed to the intake air 
before the compressor for the low pressure stage.

The low pressure EGR, however, is never active on its own but 
rather always operates together with the high pressure EGR. 


Added to this, it is only activated at a coolant temperature of more 
than 55°C. The low pressure EGR valve is closed as from a 
certain load level so that only the high pressure EGR valve is active 
again. This means the EGR rate is continuously reduced.

There is a fine meshed metal screen filter located at the exhaust 
gas inlet from the diesel particulate filter to the low pressure EGR 
system. The purpose of this filter is to ensure that no particles of 
the coating particularly in a new diesel particulate filter can enter 
the low pressure EGR system. 

Such particles would adversely affect the compressor blades of the 
exhaust turbocharger. 

The metal screen filter must be installed when fitting the low pres¬ 
sure EGR cooler to the diesel particulate filter otherwise there is a 
risk of the turbocharger being damaged.

The US engine is eguipped with the same variable twin turbo as 
the European version, however, the turbo assembly is modified due 
to the low pressure EGR. 

On the one hand, the inlet for the low pressure EGR is located on 
the compressor housing for the low pressure stage. On the other 
hand, the compressor wheels are nickel-coated to protect them 
from the exhaust gas. 






















High Pressure EGR 

The exhaust gas recirculation known to date is referred to here as 
the high pressure EGR in order to differentiate it from the low 
pressure EGR. 

Compared to the European version, the high pressure EGR is 
eguipped with the following special features: 

• Electric EGR valve with positional feedback 

• Temperature sensor before high pressure EGR valve 

• EGR cooler with bypass.

The electric actuating system of the EGR valve enables exact 
metering of the recirculated exhaust gas guantity. In addition, this 
quantity is no longer calculated based solely on the signals from 
the hot-film air mass meter and oxygen sensor but the following 
signals are also used: 

• Travel of high pressure EGR valve 

• Temperature before high pressure EGR valve 

• Pressure difference between exhaust gas pressure in the 
exhaust manifold and boost pressure in the intake manifold. 

This enables even more exact control of the EGR rate. 

The EGR cooler serves the purpose of increasing the efficiency of 
the EGR system. However, reaching the operating temperature as 
fast as possible has priority at low engine temperatures. 

In this case, the EGR cooler can be bypassed in order to heat up 
the combustion chamber faster. For this purpose, there is a bypass 
that diverts the flow of the exhaust around the EGR cooler. 

This bypass is actuated by a flap which, in turn, is operated by a 
vacuum unit. The bypass is either only in the "Open" or "Closed" 
position.

Selective Catalytic Reduction 

In order to comply with stringent EPA guidelines, the new Selective 
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system is installed in the new diesel 
vehicles from BMW. The M57D30T2 engine complies with the 
EPA Tier 2, Bin 5 reguirements. This allows the new diesel 
vehicles to be sold in all 50 states. 



The SCR system is a recently new development in the automotive 
industry, but this technology has been in use by coal fired power 
plants for many years. 

The term “selective” indicates that the reducing agent prefers to 
oxidize selectively with the oxygen contained in the nitrogen oxides 
instead of the oxygen present in the exhaust gas. 

The reducing agent is injected into the exhaust system where it is 
converted to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The resulting ammonia 
is used within a special catalyst in the exhaust stream. 

The resulting reaction converts the unwanted oxides of nitrogen 
into harmless nitrogen and water. 


The preferred reducing agent in an SCR system is ammonia (NH 3 ). 
However, ammonia by itself is toxic and would not be practical or 
safe to carry in the vehicle. So, an alternative would be a safer 
“carrier” substance which, in this case, is a urea/water compound. 

Urea, (NH 2 ) 2 CO, is commonly used as a fertilizer and is biologically 
compatible with groundwater and chemically stable for the environ¬ 
ment. This allows urea to be used as the reducing agent in the 
SCR system. The ammonia is then extracted from the urea during 
an “on-board” chemical reaction which takes place once the urea is 
injected into the exhaust system. 

The official name for the reducing agent is Diesel Exhaust Fluid or 
DEF. This is the name that will be used in the owner’s manual and 
in this training material. 

See note below: 

Important note on DEF 

In this training material, there are several terms which are in use 
for DEF. Some of these terms include reductant, reducing 
agent or urea/water solution. 

The technical name used industrywide is AUS32, which is a 
urea/water solution of which urea comprises 32.5% of the mix¬ 
ture. 

Another term which is used is AdBlue, which is the registered 
trademark for AUS32. However, there are other producers of 
AUS32. AdBlue is just one of them. 

The AdBlue trademark is currently held by the German 
Association of the Automobile Industry (VDA), who ensure 
guality standards are maintained in accordance with DIN 70070 
specifications. 




SCR Overview - Simplified 

Selective catalytic reduction is a system for reducing nitrogen 
oxides (NO x ) in the exhaust gas. For this purpose, a reducing 
agent (urea/water solution) is injected into exhaust gas downstream 
of the diesel particulate filter. 

The nitrogen oxide reduction reaction then takes place in the SCR 
catalytic converter. The urea-water solution is carried in two reser¬ 
voirs in the vehicle. The guantity is measured out such that it is 
sufficient for one oil change interval. 

The following graphic shows a simplified representation 
of the system:

The reason for using two reservoirs is that the urea-water solution 
freezes at a temperature of -11 °C (12.2°F). For this reason, the 
smaller “active” reservoir is heated but the larger passive reservoir 
is not. In this way, the entire volume of the urea-water solution 
need not be heated, thus saving energy. The amount in the active 
tank is sufficient, however, to cover large distances. 

The small, heated reservoir is referred to as the active reservoir. 

A pump conveys the urea-water solution from this reservoir to the 
metering module. This line is also heated. 

The larger, unheated reservoir is the passive reservoir. A transfer 
pump regularly conveys the urea-water solution from the passive 
reservoir to the active reservoir.

Level Sensors 

There are two level sensors in the 
passive reservoir. One supplies 
the "Full" signal and the other the 
"Empty" signal. 

The sensors make use of the con¬ 
ductivity of the urea-water solution. 
When these contacts are wetted 
with urea-water solution the circuit 
is closed and current can flow, 
thus enabling a sensor signal. 



The two level sensors send their signal to an evaluator. This evalu¬ 
ator filters the signals and recognizes, for example, sloshing of the 
urea-water solution and transfers a corresponding level signal to 
the digital diesel electronics. 


The "Full" level sensor is located at the top of the passive reservoir. 
Both contacts are wetted when the passive reservoir is completely 
filled and the sensor sends the "Full" signal. 


The "Empty" level sensor is located at the bottom end of the pas¬ 
sive reservoir. The reservoir is considered to be "not empty" for as 
long as the sensor is covered by urea-water solution. The evaluator 
detects that the passive reservoir is empty when no sensor signal is 
received. 


Transfer Unit 

The transfer unit pumps the urea-water solution from the passive 
reservoir to the active reservoir. There is a screen filter in the inlet 
port of the pump. 

This pump is designed as a diaphragm pump. It operates in a 
similar way to a piston pump but the pump element is separated 
from the medium by a diaphragm. This means there are no prob¬ 
lems regarding corrosion.

Venting 

The passive reservoir is eguipped with one operating vent (2 in the 
E90) and one filler vent. The operating vent is directed into the 
atmosphere. A so-called sintered filter tablet ensures that no impu¬ 
rities can enter the reservoir via the operating vent. This sintered 
tablet consists of a porous material and serves as a filter that allows 
particles only up to a certain size to pass through. 

The filler vent is directed into the filler pipe and therefore no filter is 
reguired.

Function Unit 

The so-called function unit is located in the active reservoir. It has 
the external appearance of a surge chamber and accommodates a 
heater, filter and a level sensor. The delivery unit is attached to it. 


The temperature sensor provides the signal for the heating control 
system. It is designed as an NTC sensor (negative temperature 
coefficient). The temperature sensor is integrated at the bottom 
end of the level sensor. 


Unlike a surge chamber in the fuel tank, the lower section of the 
function unit has slots. This chamber creates a smaller volume in 
the reservoir that scarcely mixes with the urea-water solution 
outside the chamber. 


There is a PTC heating element (positive temperature coefficient) 
in the base of the chamber that can heat up this smaller volume at 
a relatively fast rate. The intake line is also heated. In this way, the 
liquid urea-water solution can be made available for vehicle opera¬ 
tion even at the lowest temperatures.

The heating element in the chamber is connected to the heater for

supplies the current for this heating circuit. The power semicon¬

current that flows across the heating elements and can therefore 
monitor their operation.

Level Sensor 

The level sensor in the function unit provides the level value for the 
entire active reservoir. The level sensor in the active reservoir 
operates in accordance with the same principle as the level sen¬ 
sors in the passive reservoir. In this case, however, there is only 
one sensor with several contacts that extend at different levels into 
the active reservoir. 

The sensor makes use of the conductivity of the urea-water 
solution. A total of four contacts project into the reservoir. When 
these contacts are wetted with urea-water solution the circuit is 
closed and current can flow, thus enabling a sensor signal. 

Three contacts are responsible for signalling the different levels. 

The fourth contact is the reference, i.e. the contact via which the 
electric circuit is closed. This reference contact cannot be seen in 
the figure as it is located directly behind the "Empty" contact (3). 3': 

The level sensor sends its signal to an evaluator. This evaluator 
filters the signal and recognizes, for example, sloshing of the urea- 
water solution and transfers a corresponding level signal to the 
digital diesel electronics.

Delivery Unit 

The delivery unit is located on the active reservoir at the top end of 
the function unit. Among other things, the delivery unit comprises 
the pump that transfers the urea-water solution from the active 
reservoir to the metering module. The delivery unit is also heated 
by a PTC element.

The heating element in the delivery unit is connected to the heater 
for the metering line to form one heating circuit. A power semi¬ 
conductor supplies the current for this heating circuit. The power 
semiconductor is controlled by the DDE. The DDE can determine 
the current that flows across the heating elements and can there¬ 
fore monitor their operation. 


Pump 

The pump is a common part with the pump in the transfer unit. 
While the engine is running, it pumps the urea-water solution from 
the active reservoir to the metering module. It draws the metering 
line empty when the engine is turned off. 

Pressure Sensor 

The pressure sensor measures the pressure in the delivery line to 
the metering module. The value is transferred to the DDE. 

Reversing Valve 

The reversing valve ensures the delivery direction in the metering 
line can be reversed to empty the metering line while the pump 
delivers in the same direction. It is designed as a 4/2-way valve 
interchanges the metering line and intake line to the pump. 

The valve is not actuated in intervals and therefore has only two 
positions. Since power is permanently applied to the valve when it 
is actuated, the maximum actuation time is limited in order to avoid 
overheating.

Metering Module and Mixer 

The metering module is responsible for injecting the urea-water 
solution into the exhaust pipe. It features a valve that is similar to 
the fuel injector in a petrol engine with intake manifold injection.

Although the metering module does not have a heater, it is still 
heated by the exhaust system to such an extent that it even 
reguires cooling fins. 

The metering module is actuated by a pulse-width modulated 
(PWM) signal from the DDE such that the pulse duty factor deter¬ 
mines the opening duration of the valve. 

The metering module is eguipped with a tapered insert (6) that 
prevents urea-water solution residue drying up and clogging the 
valve. Its shape creates a flow that prevents urea-water solution 
from collecting on the walls of the exhaust system. Urea deposits 
on the insert are burnt off as it is heated to very high temperatures 
by the flow of exhaust gas.

The mixer mounted in the flange connection of the exhaust pipe is

It swirls the flow of exhaust gas to ensure the urea-water solution is 
thoroughly mixed with the exhaust gas. This is necessary to ensure 
the urea converts completely into ammonia. 























N0 X Sensors 

The nitrogen oxide sensor consists of the actual measuring probe 
and the corresponding control unit. The control unit communi¬ 
cates via the LoCAN with the engine control unit. 



In terms of its operating principle, the nitrogen oxide can be com¬ 
pared with a broadband oxygen sensor. The measuring principle is 
based on the idea of basing the nitrogen oxide measurement on 
oxygen measurement. 

The exhaust gas flows through the NO x sensor. Here, only oxygen 
and nitrogen oxides are of interest. In the first chamber, the oxygen 
is ionized out of this mixture with the aid of the first pump cell and 
passed through the solid electrolyte. 

A lambda signal can be tapped off from the pump current of the 
first chamber. In this way, the exhaust gas in the NO x sensor is 
liberated from free oxygen (not bound to nitrogen). 

The remaining nitrogen oxide then passes through the second 
barrier to reach the second chamber of the sensor. Here, the nitro¬ 
gen oxide is split by a catalytic element into oxygen and nitrogen. 

The oxygen released in this way is again ionized and can then pass 
through the solid electrolyte. The pump current that occurs during 
this process makes it possible to deduce the guantity of oxygen 
and the nitrogen level can be concluded from this guantity. 

The following graphic shows the functional principle of this 
measuring system.

Functions of the SCR System 

Selective catalytic reduction is currently the most effective system 
for reducing nitrogen oxides (NO x ). During operation, it achieves an 
efficiency of almost 100% and approximately 90% over the entire 
vehicle operating range. The difference is attributed to the time the 
system reguires until it is fully operative after a cold start.

Temperature sensor after DPF 


This system carries a reducing agent, urea-water solution, in the 
vehicle. The urea-water solution is injected into the exhaust pipe 
by the metering module upstream of the SCR catalytic converter. 

The DDE calculates the guantity that needs to be injected. 

The nitrogen oxide content in the exhaust gas is determined by the 
NO x sensor before the SCR catalytic converter. 

Corresponding to this value, the exact guantity of the urea-water 
solution required to fully reduce the nitrogen oxides is injected. 

The urea-water solution converts to ammonia in the exhaust pipe. 


In the SCR catalytic converter, the ammonia reacts with the 
nitrogen oxides to produce nitrogen (N 2 ) and water (H 2 O). 

A further NO x sensor that monitors this function is located down¬ 
stream of the SCR catalytic converter. 

A temperature sensor in the exhaust pipe after the diesel particu¬ 
late filter (i.e. before the SCR catalytic converter) and the metering 
module also influences this function. This is because injection of 
the urea-water solution only begins at a minimum temperature of 
200°C (392°F). 















Chemical Reaction 

The task of the SCR system is to substantially reduce the nitrogen 
oxides (NO x ) in the exhaust gas. Nitrogen oxides occur in two 
different forms: 

• Nitrogen monoxide (NO) 

• Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). 


NO N0 2 


Ammonia (NH 3 ) is used for the purpose of reducing the nitrogen 
oxides in a special catalytic converter. The ammonia is supplied in 
the form of a urea-water solution.

The urea-water solution is injected by the metering system into 
the exhaust system downstream of the diesel particulate filter. The 
reguired guantity must be metered exactly as otherwise nitrogen 
oxides or ammonia would emerge at the end. The following 
description of the chemical processes explains why this is the 
case. 

Conversion of the Urea-water Solution 

The uniform distribution of the urea-water solution in the exhaust 
gas and the conversion to ammonia take place in the exhaust pipe 
upstream of the SCR catalytic converter. 

Initially, the urea ((Nh^^CO) dissolved in the urea-water solution is 
released. The conversion of urea into ammonia takes place in two 
stages.

Thermolysis 

Explanation: 

During thermolysis, the urea-water solution is split 
into two products as a result of heating 

Initial Products: 

Urea (NH 2 ) 2 CO 

Result: 

Ammonia (NH 3 ) 

Isocyanic acid (HNCO) 

Chemical Formulas: 

(NH 2 ) 2 CO > NH 3 = HNCO 


Thermolysis: Urea converts to ammonia and isocyanic acid 



This means, only a part of the urea-water solution is converted into 
ammonia during thermolysis. The remainder, which is in the form 
of isocyanic acid, is converted in a second step. 


Hydrolysis 

Explanation: 

The isocyanic acid that was produced during thermoly¬ 
sis is converted into ammonia and carbon dioxide 
(C0 2 ), by the addition of water in the hydrolysis 

process. 

Initial Products: 

Isocyanic acid (HNCO) 

Water (H 2 0) 

Result: 

Ammonia (NH 3 ) 

Carbon dioxide (C0 2 ) 

Chemical 

Formulas: 

hnco + h 2 o>nh 3 + co 2 


Hydrolysis: Isocyanic acid reacts with water to form ammonia and carbon dioxide 


HNCO H 2 0 NH 3 CO 2 

The water required for this purpose is also provided by the 
urea-water solution. Therefore, following hydrolysis, all the urea is 
converted into ammonia and carbon dioxide. 
















N0 X Reduction 

Nitrogen oxides are converted 
into harmless nitrogen and 
water in the SCR catalytic 
converter. 



Reduction 

Explanation: 

The catalytic converter serves as a "docking" mecha¬ 
nism for the ammonia molecules. The nitrogen oxide 
molecules meet the ammonia molecules and the 
reaction starts and energy is released. This applies to 
NO in the same way as to N 02 -

It can be seen that each individual atom has found its place again 
at the end of the process, i.e. exactly the same elements are on the 
left as on the right. 

This takes place only when the ratio of the urea-water solution to 
nitrogen oxides is correct. Nitrogen oxides would emerge if too little 
urea-water solution were injected. 

By the same token, ammonia would emerge if too much urea-water 
solution were injected, resulting in unpleasant odor and possible 
damage to the environment.

The metering strategy is an integral part of the SCR control that 
calculates how much urea-water solution is to be injected at what 
time.

The NO x sensor, however, measures not only nitrogen oxides but 
also ammonia but cannot distinguish between them. If too much 
urea-water solution is injected, although the nitrogen oxides are 
completely reduced so-called "ammonia slip" occurs, i.e. ammonia 
emerges from the SCR catalytic converter. This in turn causes a 
rise in the value measured by the NO x sensor. The aim, therefore, 
is to achieve a minimum of the sensor value. 

This, however, is a long-term adaptation and not a short-term con¬ 
trol process as the SCR catalytic converter performs a storage 
function for ammonia. 


During normal operation, the signal from the NO x sensor before the 
SCR catalytic converter is used for the purpose of calculating the 
guantity. This sensor determines the guantity of nitrogen oxide in 
the exhaust gas and sends the corresponding value to the DDE. 

However, the NO x sensor must reach its operating temperature 
before it can start measuring. Depending on the temperature, this 
can take up to 15 minutes. Until then the DDE uses a substitute 
value to determine the amount of nitrogen oxide in the exhaust gas. 

A second NO x sensor is installed after the SCR catalytic converter 
for the purpose of monitoring the system. It measures whether 
there are still nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas. If so the injected 
guantity of the urea-water solution is correspondingly adapted.

Metering System Control 

The metering system control could be considered as the executing 
part. It carries out the reguirements set by the metering strategy. 

This includes both the metering, i.e. injection as well as the supply 
of the urea-water solution. 

The tasks of the metering system control during normal operation 
are listed in the following: 

Metering of the urea-water solution: 

• Implementation of the reguired target guantity of urea-water 
solution 

• Feedback of the implemented actual guantity of urea-water 
solution. 

Supplying urea-water solution: 

• Preparation of metering process (filling lines and pressure 
built-up) under corresponding ambient conditions (tempera¬ 
ture) 

• Emptying lines during afterrunning 

• Heater actuation. 

In addition, the metering system control recognizes faults, implausi¬ 
ble conditions or critical situations and initiates corresponding 
measures. 


Metering of the Urea-water Solution 

The metering strategy determines the guantity of urea-water 
solution to be injected. The metering system control executes this 
reguest. A part of the function is metering actuation that deter¬ 
mines the actual opening of the metering valve. 

Depending on the engine load, the metering valve injects at a rate 
of 0.5 Hz to 3.3 Hz. 

The metering actuation facility calculates the following factors in 
order to inject the correct guantity: 

• The duty factor of the actuator of the metering valve in order to 
determine the injection duration 

• Actuation delay to compensate for the reaction time of the 
metering valve. 

The signal from the pressure sensor in the metering line is taken 
into account to ensure an accurate calculation; the pressure, 
however, should remain at a constant 5 bar. 

The metering system control also calculates the guantity actually 
metered and signals this value back to the metering strategy. 

The metering guantity is also determined over a longer period of 
time. This long-term calculation is reset during SCR refilling or can 
be reset by the BMW diagnosis system. 



Supplying Urea-water Solution 

A supply of a urea-water solution is required for the selective cat¬ 
alytic reduction process. It is necessary to store this medium in the 
vehicle and to make it available rapidly under all operating condi¬ 
tions. In this case “making available” means that the urea-water 
solution is applied at a defined pressure at the metering valve. 

Various functions that are described in the following are required to 
carry out this task. 

Heater 

The system must be heated as the urea-water solution freezes at a 
temperature of -11 °C. 

The heating system performs following tasks: 

• To monitor the temperature in the active reservoir and the 
ambient temperature 

• To thaw a sufficient quantity of urea-water solution and the 
components required for metering the solution during system 
startup 

• To prevent the relevant components freezing during operation 

• To monitor the components of the heating system. 

The following components are heated: 

• Surge chamber in active reservoir 

• Intake line in active reservoir 

• Delivery module (pump, filter, reversing valve) 

• Metering line (from active reservoir to metering module). 

The heating systems for the metering line and delivery module are 
controlled dependent on the ambient temperature. 

The heater in the active reservoir is controlled as a function of the 
temperature in the active reservoir. 


The heating control is additionally governed by the following 
conditions:

Metering standby is delayed at a temperature below -9°C in the 
active reservoir, i.e. a defined waiting period is allowed to elapse 
until an attempt to build up pressure begins. 

This time is constant from -9°C to -16.5°C as it is not possible to 
determine to what extent the urea-water solution is frozen. 

At temperatures below -16.5°C, the heating time is extended until 
an attempt to build up the pressure is made. Heating the metering 
line generally takes place much faster. 

Therefore, the temperature in the active reservoir is the decisive 
factor for the period of time until an attempt to build up the 
pressure is undertaken. 

However, it is possible that the heating time for the metering line is 
longer at ambient temperature considerably lower than the temper¬ 
ature in the active reservoir. In this case, the ambient temperature is 
taken for the delay in metering standby.

Temperature in degrees Celsius 


The graphic shows that, with the same temperature signals, the 
delay time relating to the temperature in the active reservoir is 
longer than the delay caused by the ambient temperature. 

Only the times at temperatures below -9°C are relevant as they are 
shorter than 3 minutes at temperatures above -9°C. 3 minutes is 
the time that the entire system reguires to establish metering 
standby (e.g. also taking into account the temperature in the SCR 
catalytic converter). 


This is also the time that is approved by the EPA (Environmental 
Protection Agency) as the preliminary period under all operating 
conditions. This time is extended significantly at very low tempera¬ 
tures. The following example shows how the delay time up to 
metering standby is derived at low temperatures. 

Example: Ambient temperature: -30°C, temperature in active 
reservoir: -12°C The vehicle was driven for a longer period of time 
at very low ambient temperatures of - 30°C. The heater in the 
active reservoir has thawed the urea-water solution. 

The vehicle is now parked for a short period of time (e.g. 30 min¬ 
utes). When restarted, the temperature in the active reservoir is 
now -12°C. 

The delay time that is initiated by the temperature in the active 
reservoir is approximately 18 minutes while the delay time initiated 
by the ambient temperature is 25 minutes. Since the delay time 
initiated by the ambient temperature is longer, this will give rise to a 
longer delay. 

Now another condition comes into play. Only the end of the delay 
caused by the temperature in the active reservoir can enable 
metering. This means: 

• The delay time initiated by the temperature in the active reser¬ 
voir will have elapsed after 18 minutes. No enable is yet 
provided by the second delay caused by the ambient tempera¬ 
ture. A second cycle of 18 minutes now begins. 

• The delay time initiated by the ambient temperature will 
elapse after 25 minutes and will send its enable signal. 
However, this delay cannot enable metering. 

• The second cycle of the delay time caused by the tempera¬ 
ture in the active reservoir will have elapsed after 36 minutes. 
Since the enable from the delay caused by the ambient tem¬ 
perature is now applied, metering will be enabled. 
















Transfer Pumping 

So-called transfer pumping is required since two reservoirs are 
used for storing the urea-water solution. The term transfer pump¬ 
ing relates to pumping the urea-water solution from the passive 
reservoir into the active reservoir.

The solution is then pumped fora certain time in order to refill the 
active reservoir. The transfer pumping procedure is terminated if 
the "full" level is reached before the time has elapsed. 

If the passive reservoir was refilled, transfer pumping will only take 
place after a quantity of approximately 3 liters has been used up in 
the active reservoir. The entire quantity is then pumped over. 

The system then waits again until a quantity of approximately 
3 liters has been used up in the active reservoir before again 
pumping the entire quantity while simultaneously starting the incor¬ 
rect refilling detection function. 

This function determines whether the system has been filled with 
the wrong medium as it is present in high concentration in the 
active reservoir. 

Transfer pumping does not take place in the event of a fault in the 
level sensor system. 


The following conditions must be met for transfer pumping: 

• There is a urea-water solution in the passive reservoir 

• The ambient temperature is above a minimum value of -5°C 
for at least 10 minutes 

• A defined quantity (300 ml) was used up in the active reservoir 
or the reserve level in the active reservoir was reached.

Delivery 

The urea-water solution is delivered from the active reservoir to the 
metering module. This task is performed by a pump that is inte¬ 
grated in the delivery unit. The delivery unit additionally contains: 

• Heater 

• Pressure sensor 

• Filter 

• Return throttle 

• Reversing valve.

The pump is actuated by a pulse-width modulated signal (PWM 
signal) from the DDE. The PWM signal provides a speed specifica¬ 
tion for the purpose of establishing the system pressure. The value 
for the speed specification is calculated by the DDE based on the 
signal from the pressure sensor. 

When the system starts up, the pump is actuated with a defined 
PWM signal and the line to the metering module is filled. This is 
followed by pressure build-up. Only then does pressure control 
take place. 








































When the metering line is filled, the opened metering valve allows a 
small guantity of the urea-water solution to be injected into the 
exhaust system. 

During pressure control, i.e. during normal operation with metering, 
the pump is actuated in such a way that a pressure of 5 bar is 
applied in the metering line. Only a small part of the urea-water 
solution delivered by the pump is actually injected. 

The majority of the solution is transferred via a throttle back into the 
active reservoir. This means, the delivery pressure is determined 
by the pump speed together with the throttle cross section.

The solution is injected four times per second. The guantity is 
determined by the opening time and stroke of the metering valve. 
However, the guantity is so low that there is no noticeable drop in 
pressure in the metering line. 

Evacuating 

After turning off the engine, the reversing valve switches to reverse 
the delivery direction of the pump, thus evacuating the metering 
line and metering module. 

Evacuation also takes place if the system has to be shut down due 
to a fault or if the minimum temperature in the active reservoir can 
no longer be maintained. 

This is necessary to ensure no urea-water solution remains in the 
metering line or metering module as it can freeze. 

The metering valve is opened during evacuation.

Level Measurement 

There are level sensors both in the active as well as in the passive 
reservoir. However, these sensors are not continuous sensors as in 
the fuel system for example. They can determine only a specific 
point, to which a defined quantity of urea-water solution in the 
reservoir is assigned. 

Two separate level sensors are fitted in the passive reservoir, one 
for "full" and one for "empty". The signals from the level sensors 
are not sent directly to the DDE but rather to an evaluator. 

The active reservoir contains one level sensor that has various 
measuring points: 

• Full 

• Warning 

• Empty. 

Also in this case, there is an evaluator installed between the 
sensors and the DDE, which fulfils the same tasks as for the pas¬ 
sive reservoir.

This evaluator sends a plausible level signal to the DDE. It recog¬ 
nizes changes in the fill level caused, for example, by driving 
uphill/downhill or sloshing of the liquid as opposed to an actual 
change in the liquid level in the reservoir. 

Low level is therefore signalled when the corresponding sensor is 
no longer covered by the urea-water solution for a defined period of 
time. Once the level drops below this value, it can no longer be 
reached during normal operation. This means, the liquid sloshing 
on the sensor or driving uphill/downhill is no longer interpreted as a 
higher liquid level.

The level measurement system must also recognize when the 
active and passive reservoirs are refilled. This is achieved by 
comparing the current level with the value last stored. 

The level sensor signal after refilling corresponds to the signal 
while driving uphill. To avoid possible confusion, the refilling recog¬ 
nition function is limited to a certain period of time after starting the 
engine and driving off - as it can be assumed that refilling will only 
take place while the vehicle is stationary. 

A certain vehicle speed must be exceeded to ensure that sloshing 
occurs, thus providing a clear indication that the system has been 
refilled. 
























Refilling the system while the engine is running can also be detect¬ 
ed but with modified logic. The signals sent by the sensors while 
the vehicle is stationary are also used for this purpose. The vehicle 
must be stationary for a defined minimum period in order to make 
the filling plausible. 

When the urea-water solution is frozen, a level sensor will show the 
same value as when it is not wetted/covered by the solution. 

A frozen reservoir is therefore shown as empty. For this reason, the 
following sensor signals are used for measuring the level: 

• Ambient temperature 

• Temperature in active reservoir 

• Fleater enable. 

Level Calculation 

This function calculates the guantity of urea-water solution remain¬ 
ing in the active reservoir. The calculation is calibrated together 
with the level measurement. 

Every time the level drops below a level sensor the corresponding 
amount of urea-water solution in the reservoir is stored. The 
amount of urea-water solution actually injected is then subtracted 
from this value while the pumped guantity is added. 

This makes it possible to determine the level more precisely than 
that would be possible by simple measurement. In addition, the 
level can still be determined in the event of one of the level sensors 
failing. 

Since it is possible that refilling is not recognized, the calculation is 
continued only until the level ought to drop below the next lower 
sensor. 


Example: 

Once the level drops below the "full" level sensor, for example, from 
now on the guantity of used and repumped urea-water solution is 
taken into account and the actual level below "full" calculated. 

Normally, the level then drops below the next lower level sensor at 
the same time as determined by the level calculation. An adjust¬ 
ment takes place at this point and the calculation is restarted. 

If, however, a guantity of urea-water solution is refilled without it 
being detected, the actual level will be higher than the calculated 
level. The level calculation is stopped if it calculates that the level 
ought to have dropped below the next level sensor but the level 
sensor is still wetted/covered. 

Byway of exception, a defective level sensor can cause the calcula¬ 
tion to continue until the reservoir is empty.

SCR System Modes 

When the ignition is switched on, the SCR control undergoes a 
logical seguence of modes in the DDE. There are conditions that 
initiate the change from one mode to the other. The following 
graphic shows the seguence of modes which are subseguently 
described. 



INIT (SCR initialization) 

The control unit is switched on (terminal 15 ON) and the SCR sys¬ 
tem is initialized. 

STANDBY (SCR not active) 

STANDBY mode is assumed either after initialization or in the case 
of fault. AFTERRUN mode is assumed if terminal 15 is switched 
off in this state or a fault occurs. 

NOPRESSURECONTROL 

(waiting for enable for pressure control) 

NOPRESSURECONTROL mode is assumed when no faults occur 
in the system. In this mode, the system is waiting for the pressure 
control enable that is provided by the following sensor signals: 

• Temperature in catalytic converter 

• Temperature in active reservoir 

• Ambient temperature 

• Engine status (engine running). 

The system also remains in NOPRESSURECONTROL mode fora 
minimum period of time so that a plausibility check of the pressure 
sensor can be performed. 

PRESSURECONTROL mode is assumed once the enable is finally 
given. STANDBY mode is assumed if terminal 15 is switched off or 
a fault occurs in NOPRESSURECONTROL mode. 





































PRESSURECONTROL (SCR system running) 

PRESSURECONTROL mode is the normal operating status of the 
SCR system and has four submodes. 

PRESSURECONTROL mode is maintained until terminal 15 is 
switched off. A change to PRESSUREREDUCTION mode then 
takes place. A change to PRESSUREREDUCTION mode also 
takes place if a fault occurs in the system. 

The four submodes of PRESSURECONTROL are described in the 
following: 

• REFILL 

The delivery module, metering line and the metering module 
are filled when REFILL mode is assumed. The pump is actu¬ 
ated and the metering valve opened by a defined value. 

The fill level is calculated. 

The mode changes to PRESSUREBUILDUP when the 
reguired fill level is reached ora defined pressure increase is 
detected. 

PRESSUREREDUCTION mode is assumed if terminal 15 is 
switched off or a fault occurs in the system. 

• PRESSUREBUILDUP 

In this mode, the pressure is built up to a certain value. For this 
purpose, the pump is actuated while the metering valve is 
closed. 

If the pressure is built up within a certain time, the system 
switches to the next mode of METERINGCONTROL. If the 
reguired pressure built-up is not achieved after the defined 
period of time has elapsed, a status loop is initiated, and VEN¬ 
TILATION mode is assumed. 


If the pressure cannot be built up after a defined number of 
attempts, the system signals a fault and assumes PRESSUR¬ 
EREDUCTION mode. 

PRESSUREREDUCTION mode is also assumed when termi¬ 
nal 15 is switched off or another fault occurs in the system. 

VENTILATION 

If the pressure could not be increased beyond a certain value 
in PRESSUREBUILDUP mode, it is assumed that there is still 
air in the pressure line. 

The metering valve is opened for a defined period of time to 
allow this air to escape. This status is exited after this time has 
elapsed and the system returns to PRESSUREBUILDUP 
mode. The loop between PRESSUREBUILDUP and VENTI¬ 
LATION varies corresponding to the condition of the reducing 
agent. The reason for this is that a different level is established 
after REFILL depending on the ambient conditions. Repeating 
the ventilation function will ensure that the pressure line is 
completely filled with reducing agent. PRESSUREREDUC¬ 
TION mode is assumed if terminal 15 is switched off or a fault 
occurs in the system. 

METERINGCONTROL 

The system can enable metering in METERINGCONTROL 
mode. This is the actual status during normal operation. 

The urea-water solution is injected in this mode. In this mode, 
the pump is actuated in such a way that a defined pressure is 
established. This pressure is monitored. If the pressure pro¬ 
gression overshoots or undershoots defined parameters, a 
fault is detected and the system assumes PRESSURERE¬ 
DUCTION mode. These faults are reset on return to METER¬ 
INGCONTROL mode. 

PRESSUREREDUCTION mode is also assumed if terminal 15 
is switched off or another fault occurs in the system.

PRESSUREREDUCTION 

Metering enable is cancelled on entering PRESSUREREDUCTION 
mode. 

This status reduces the pressure in the delivery module, metering 
line and the metering module after PRESSURECONTROL mode. 
For this purpose, the reversing valve is opened and the pump actu¬ 
ated at a certain value, the metering valve is closed. 

PRESSUREREDUCTION mode ends when the pressure drops 
below a certain value. The system assumes NOPRESSURECON- 
TROL mode if the pressure threshold is reached (undershot) within 
a defined time. 

The system signals a fault if the pressure does not drop below the 
threshold after a defined time has elapsed. In this case or also in 
the case of another fault, the system assumes NOPRESSURE- 
CONTROL mode. NOPRESSURECONTROL mode is also 
assumed when terminal 15 is switched on. 

AFTERRUN 

The system is shut down in AFTERRUN mode. If terminal 15 is 
switched on again before afterrun has been completed, afterrun is 
cancelled and STANDBY mode is assumed. If this is not the case 
the system goes through the submodes of AFTERRUN. 

• TEMPWAIT (catalytic converter cooling phase) 

In AFTERRUN mode, TEMPWAIT submode is initially 
assumed if the system is filled. This is intended to prevent 
excessively hot exhaust gasses being drawn into the SCR 
system. 

The duration of the cooling phase is determined by the 
exhaust gas temperature. EMPTYING submode is assumed 
after this time, in which the exhaust system cools down, has 
elapsed. EMPTYING submode is also assumed if a fault 
occurs in the system. If terminal 15 is switched on in this sta¬ 
tus, STANDBY mode is assumed. 


EMPTYING 

The system assumes AFTERRUN_EMPTYING submode 
after the cooling phase. The pressure line and the delivery 
module are emptied in this submode. The urea-water solution 
is drawn back into the active reservoir by opening the revers¬ 
ing valve, actuating the pump and opening the metering valve. 

This is intended to prevent the urea-water solution freezing in 
the metering line or the metering module. The level in the 
metering line is calculated in this mode. 

PRESSURECOMPENSATION mode is assumed if the meter¬ 
ing line is empty. PRESSURECOMPENSATION mode is also 
assumed if a fault occurs in the system. If terminal 15 is 
switched on, STANDBY mode is assumed. 

PRESSURECOMPENSATION 
(intake line - ambient pressure) 

After the system has been completely emptied, PRES¬ 
SURECOMPENSATION submode is assumed. In this status 
the pump is switched off, the reversing valve is then closed 
followed by the metering valve after a delay. The time interval 
between switching off the pump and closing the valve 
prevents a vacuum forming in the intake line; pressure com¬ 
pensation between the intake line and ambient pressure takes 
place. 

After executing the steps correctly the system assumes WAIT- 
ING_FOR_SHUTOFF submode. WAITING_FOR_SHUTOFF 
is also assumed if a fault occurs in the system. If terminal 15 is 
switched on, STANDBY mode is assumed. 

WAITING_FOR_SHUTOFF (shutting down SCR) 

The control unit is shut down and switched off.

Warning and Shut-down Scenario 

The SCR system is relevant to the vehicle complying with the exhaust emission regulations - it is a prereguisite for EPA approval. 

If the system fails, the approval will be invalidated and the vehicle must no longer be operated. Avery plausible case leading to the system 
failure is that the urea-water solution runs out. 

Vehicle operation is no longer permitted without the urea-water solution, therefore, the engine will no longer start. To ensure the driver is 
not caught out, a warning and shut-down scenario is provided that begins at a sufficiently long time before the vehicle actually shuts down 
so that the driver can either conveniently top up the urea-water solution himself or have it topped up. 

Warning Scenario 

The warning scenario begins when the level drops below the "Warning" level sensor in the active reservoir. At this point, the active reser¬ 
voir is still approximately 50% full with urea-water solution. The level is then determined as a defined volume (depending on type of vehi¬ 
cle). 

From this point on, the actual consumption of the urea-water solution is subtracted from this value. The mileage is recorded when the 
amount of 2500 ml is reached. 

A countdown from 1000 mis now takes place irrespective of the actual consumption of the urea-water solution. The driver receives a 
priority 2 (yellow) check control message showing the remaining range. 

If the vehicle is eguipped with an on-board computer (CID - Central Information Display), instruction will also be displayed. The driver 
receives a priority 1 (red) check control message as from 200 mis. 

The following messages and indicators will be displayed:

Shut-down Scenario 

If the range reaches 0 mis, similar as to in the fuel gauge, three dashes are shown instead of the range. The check control message in the 
CID changes and shows that the engine can no longer be started. 

In this case, it will no longer be possible to start the engine if it has been shut down for longer than three minutes. This is intended to allow 
the driver to move out of a hazardous situation if necessary. 

If the system is refilled only after engine start has been disabled, the logic of the refill recognition system is changed in this special case, 
enabling faster refill. 

Exhaust Fluid Incorrect 

If the system is filled with an incorrect medium, this will become apparent after several hundred miles (kilometers) later by elevated 
nitrogen oxide values in the exhaust gas despite adequate injection of the supposed urea-water solution. The system recognizes an incor¬ 
rect medium when certain limits are exceeded. From this point on, a warning and shut-down scenario is also initiated that allows a 
remaining range of 200 mis. 

The exclamation mark in the symbol identifies the fault in the system. In this case, the message in the CID informs the driver to go to the

Refilling 

The active and passive reservoirs can be refilled with urea-water 
solution either by the service workshop or by the customer himself. 

The system can be refilled without any problems with the vehicle 
on an incline of up to 5° in any direction. In this case, 90% of the 
maximum possible fill is still achieved. 

The volume of the urea-water solution reservoir is designed such 
that the range is large enough to cover one oil change interval. 

This means the "normal" refill takes place as part of the servicing 
work in the workshop. If, however, the supply of urea-water solution 
should run low prematurely due to extraordinary driving profile, it is 
possible to top up a smaller guantity. 

Refilling in Service Workshop 

Refilling in the service workshop refers to the routine refill as part of 
the oil change procedure. This takes place at the latest after: 

• 13000 mis on the E90, 

• 11000 mis on the E70 or 

• one year. 

In this case, the system must be emptied first in order to remove 
older urea-water solution. This takes place via the extractor 
connections in the transfer line. Although a small residual guantity 
always remains in the reservoirs, it is negligible. 

Topping Up 

Any reguired guantity can be topped up if the urea-water solution 
reserve does not last up to the next oil change. Ideally, this guantity 
should only be as much as is reguired to reach the next oil change, 
as the system is then emptied. 


Diesel Exhaust Fluid 

The diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is a urea-water solution which acts 
as a the carrier for the ammonia that is used to reduce the nitrogen 
oxides (NO x ) in the exhaust gas. 

To protect persons and the environment from the effects of ammo¬ 
nia and to make it more easy to handle for transport and refuelling 
procedures, it is provided in an agueous urea solution for the SCR 
process. 

The recommended urea-water solution must meet certain 
standards for guality which are set forth in accordance with the 
DIN 70070/AUS32. 

The DEF is a high-purity, water-clear, synthetically manufactured 
solution consisting of 32.5% urea with the balance being water 
(67.5%). The urea-water solution used must correspond to this 
standard. 

Health and Safety 

It is an agueous solution which poses no special risks. It is not a 
hazardous substance and it is not a dangerous medium which is 
readily apparent after reviewing the Material Safety Data (MSDS) 
sheets. 

The urea-water solution is not toxic. If small amounts of the product 
come in contact with the skin while handling the urea-water solu¬ 
tion it is sufficient to simply rinse it off with ample water. In this 
way, the possibility of any ill effects on human health are ruled out. 

The urea-water solution can be broken down by microbes and is 
therefore easily degradable. The urea-water solution poses a 
minimum risk to water and soil. Refer to local laws regarding han¬ 
dling and disposal reguirements. 



Materials Compatibility 

Contact of urea-water solution with copper and zinc as well as their 
alloys and aluminum must be avoided as this leads to corrosion. No 
problems whatsoever are encountered with stainless steel and 
most plastics. 

Storage and Durability 

To avoid adverse effects on quality due to contamination and high 
testing expenditure, the urea-water solution should only be handled 
in storage and filling systems specifically designed for this purpose. 

In view of the fact that the urea-water solution freezes solid at a 
temperature of -11 °C and decomposes at an accelerated rate at 
temperatures above 25°C, the storage and filling systems should 
be set up in such a way that a temperature range from 30°C 
to -11°C is ensured. 

Provided the recommended storage temperature of maximum 
25°C is maintained, the urea-water solution meets the require¬ 
ments stipulated by the standard DIN 70070 for at least 12 months 
after its manufacture. 

This period of time is shortened if the recommended storage tem¬ 
perature is exceeded. The urea-water solution will become solid if 
cooled to temperatures below -11 °C. When heated up, the frozen 
urea-water solution becomes liquid again and can be used without 
any loss in quality. Avoid direct UV radiation. 

Service Concerns 

When servicing SCR system components, absolute cleanliness is 
important. When cleaning any components, particularly those 
which contain the urea-water solution (DEF), it is important to use 
only “lint-free” cloths. Any lint can contaminate or clog SCR sys¬ 
tem components rendering the system inoperative.

Glow-plug System 

The glow-plug system is responsible for providing reliable cold 
start properties and smooth operation when the engine is cold. 

The DDE control module sends the temperature requirement of 
the heater plug to the heating control unit. The heating control 
unit implements the request and actuates the heater plugs with a 
pulse-width modulated signal. 

The heating control unit additionally sends diagnosis and status 
information via the LIN-bus connection back to the digital diesel 
electronics.

The LIN-bus is a bi-directional data interface that operates in 
accordance with the master/slave principle. The DDE control unit 
is the master. 


Each of the six heating circuits can be diagnosed individually. 

When the heating control unit is switched on for the first time, the 
electrical resistance of the heater plugs is evaluated at the start of 
the heating process. A hot heater plug has a much higher resist¬ 
ance than a cold plug. If hot heater plugs are detected based on 
their resistance, less power is applied to the heater plugs at the 
start of the heating cycle. 






















































































If, on the other hand, cold heater plugs are detected, the maximum 
power is applied to the heater plugs at the start of the heating 
cycle. This function is known as dynamic repeat heating. This 
function avoids the situation where too much power is applied to a 
heater plug, which is already hot, as the result of a second heating 
cycle following shortly after the first, and therefore overheats. 

The DDE control unit determines the necessary heater plug 
temperature as a function of the following operating values: 

• Engine speed 

• Intake air temperature 

• Injected guantity 

• Ambient pressure 

• System voltage 

• Status signal, starter enable. 

The digital diesel electronics sends the reguired heater plug 
temperature to the heating control unit to activate heating. 

The heating system assumes various operating modes that are 
explained in the following. 

Preheating 

Preheating is activated after terminal 15 has been switched on. 

The heater system indicator in the instrument cluster is activated at 
a coolant temperature of < 10°C. 

Preheating is finished when: 

• The engine speed threshold of 42 rpm is exceeded (starter is 
operated) or 

• the preheating time has elapsed. The preheating time is 
dependent on the coolant temperature and is defined in a 
characteristic curve.

Start Standby Heating 

Start standby heating is activated when the preheating process is 
terminated by the preheating time elapsing. Start standby heating 
is terminated: 

• After 10 seconds or 

• when the engine speed threshold of 42 rpm is exceeded. 

Start Heating 

Start heating is activated during every engine start procedure when 
the coolant temperature is below 75°C. Start heating begins after 
the engine speed threshold of 42 rpm has been exceeded. 

Start heating is terminated: 

• After the maximum start heating time of 60 seconds has 
elapsed or 

• after the engine start operation has been completed or 

• when the coolant temperature of 75°C is exceeded.

Emergency Heating 

Emergency heating is triggered for 3 minutes in the event of 
communication between the DDE control unit and heating control 
unit failing for more than 1 second. 

The heating control unit then uses safe values so as to prevent 
damage to the heating system. 

Concealed Heating 

Preheating and start standby heating are activated as so-called 
concealed heating up to a coolant temperature of 30°C. 

Concealed heating is triggered a maximum of 4 times and is then 
not enabled again before the engine is restarted. 

Concealed heating is triggered by the following signals: 

• Driver's seat occupancy 

• Driver's seat belt buckle 

• Valid key 

• Terminal R 

• Clutch operated. 

Partial Load Heating 

Partial load heating can occur at coolant temperatures below 75°C 
after starting the engine. Actuation of the heater plugs depends on 
the engine speed and load, thus improving the exhaust gas charac¬ 
teristics. 

Actuation and Fault Detection 

The power output stages for heater plug actuation are located in 
the heater control unit. The heater control unit does not have its 
own fault code memory. Faults in the heating system detected by 
the heater control unit are signalled via the LIN-bus to the digital 
diesel electronics. 


The corresponding fault codes are then stored in the DDE fault 
code memory. 

To avoid damage, the heater control unit shuts down all heating 
activities when the permissible operating temperature of the heater 
control unit is exceeded. 

The ceramic heater plugs are designed for an operating voltage of 
7.0 to 10.0 V. A voltage of 10 V can be applied to heat up the plug 
at a faster rate during the heating process. A PWM signal is 
applied to the heater plugs for the purpose of maintaining the 
heater plug temperature. 

Conseguently, an effective voltage is established at the heater 
plugs that is lower than the system voltage. 

Note: The ceramic heater plugs are susceptible to impact 
and bending loads. Heater plugs that have been 
dropped may be damaged. 

Note: A maximum voltage of 7 V may be applied to the 
heater plugs when removed. Higher voltages 
without cooling air movement can irreparably 
damage the heater plugs.
