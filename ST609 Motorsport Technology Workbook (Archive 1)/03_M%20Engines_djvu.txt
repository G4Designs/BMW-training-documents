Motorsport Engines History 


Motorsport Engine History 

Since 1972, BMW M GmbH, the “motorsport” division of BMW 
has been turning out some of the most powerful and legendary 
engine packages in the auto industry. The letter “M” has been 
referred to as “the most powerful letter in the world”. Customers 
who are familiar with the “M” badge know that when the buy an 
M-car, they have come to expect something special under the 
hood. 



Ml 


S38 (M88) 

The first BMW motorsport engine was the in-line 6-cylinder 
known then as the M88. This engine was introduced with the 
legendary Ml in 1978. Since then, the M88 engine has been 
known as the S38 in production vehicles. In the Ml, the M88 
produced 277hp which was impressive for a 6-cylinder engine in 
1978. 

The S38 engine, which was a slightly “de-tuned” version of the 
M88, was first introduced into the US market in the E28 M5 in 
1988. The 256 hp S38 featured some of the BMW motorsport 
philosophy which is still in use today. 


Innovations such as individual throttles, 4 valves per cylinder, light¬ 
weight valvetrain and steel crankshaft are still in use on current M 
engines. 

The E24 M6 also took advantage of the S38 engine technology 
through its production life. The M6 was available in the US in 
1987 and 1988. 










































S14 

BMW produced a “Motorsport” version of the E30 which was intro¬ 
duced a year before the M5. The first M3 featured a Formula One 
derived race bred powerplant that came to be known as the SI 4. 
The SI 4 was a 2.3 liter, 4-cylinder engine capable of 192 hp at 
6750 rpm. Considering that this is a “naturally aspired” engine, 
a 4-cylinder engine producing 192 horsepower was impressive 
especially in 1987. 



The SI 4 engine was a further development of the 4-cylinder 
engine which was used to propel the BMW Brabham FI car to the 
1983 FI World Championship. The Formula 1 engine (Ml 2/MI 3) 
was derived from the “stock block” Ml 0 engine. The Ml 2/MI 3 FI 
engine displaced 1.5 liters, was turbocharged and capable of pro¬ 
ducing in excess of 1100 bhp. This is an impressive feat for an 
engine which was developed from a stock powerplant. The exten¬ 
sive research and development of the Formula 1 engine led to the 
SI 4 engine ultimate production of the SI 4.

S50 (US) 

The E30 M3 was discontinued in 1991. The next generation M3 
would not be available until 1995. The E36 M3 was based on the 
new 3 series coupe introduced in 1991. This was the first time 
that a 6-cylinder was available in the M3. 

The new S50 (US) engine was derived from the M50TU already in 
use at that time. The new M3 engine produced 240 hp and dif¬ 
fered considerably from the European version. The S50 (US) 
engine was only available for one year (1995). In order to comply 
with OBD II regulations, the S50 was discontinued in favor of the 
S52 in 1996. The S52 was a 3.2 liter engine using Siemens 
engine management. 



S52 

In 1996, the M3 received the new S52 3.2 liter engine which pro¬ 
duced 240 hp. This was the first OBDII compliant “M” engine and 
also the first to use Siemens engine management instead of 
Bosch. 

The engine was based on the M52 production engine and used 
much of the same technology as the previous (S50 US) engine. 
The S52 was also used in the “M” Roadster and Coupe. The S52 
would be in use until 2001, when it was replaced by the S54. 








S54 

The S54 would be the powerplant of choice for the 3rd generation 
M3. The new in-line 6-cylinder “M” engine marked a major leap in 
engine technology for that time. For the first time in a production 
“M” car, the S54 achieved the elusive goal of 100 hp per liter. With 
333 hp at 7900 RPM, S54 propelled the E46 M3 to 0-60 times of 
4.8 seconds. The engine is also installed in the M Roadster and M 
Coupe. 



The S54 was the first Motorsport 6-cylinder to use the “High- 
Pressure Double VANOS” system. 


Some of the other engine highlights include: 

• 11.5 to 1 compression 

• 6 individual throttle assemblies with electronic throttle control 

• A unique lightweight valve actuating mechanism 

• Forged steel crankshaft with “nitro-carburized” heat treatment 

• “Semi-dry sump” lubrication system 

• Light weight one-piece cylinder head 

• High-strength cast iron engine block 

Together with the Motorsport designed engine management sys¬ 
tem, the S54 also meets the required LEV emission standards as 
well.

S62 

Another first time achievement for the Motorsport division, was the 
introduction of the first V-8 “M” engine. The 5 liter S62 was also 
the most powerful production “M” engine with an output of 394hp. 

The S62 was first used in the third generation M5, the E39. Also, 
the S62 was used in the Z8 which marks only the second time in 
which an “M” engine was used in a non-”M” vehicle. The first time 
being the S70 in the E31 850Csi. 


Features of the S62 engine include: 

• 8 individual throttle controlled 
electronically via two throttle motors 

• Hi-pressure Double VANOS 

• Lightweight aluminum block and cylinder heads 

• Lightweight valvetrain 

• “Semi-dry sump” oiling system

Formula One Engine 

The S85 engine has benefitted greatly from the lessons learned in 
Formula 1. The FI counterpart of the S85 is known as the P84/5. 
This is a 3 liter V-10 which consists of approximately 5000 parts 
and requires around 100 hours of assembly time. 

The engine block and cylinder heads are constructed of aluminum 
alloy and are designed to withstand the demands and stresses of 
an FI race. The titanium connecting rods are just one example of 
components which allow the P84/5 to reach engine speeds of 
more than 19,000 RPM. 

Some interesting facts of the FI V-10: 

• During the design of the FI V-10 approximately 1000 
technical drawings are created. 

• The total engine weighs less than 195 pounds. 



M 



11 


• The exhaust temperature can reach up to 1620°F. 

• The air temperature in the pneumatic valve system can 
reach 450°F. 

• Before the recent changes in FI rules regarding engines, 
BMW produced about 200 engines per race season. 

• The P84/5 engine propels the FW27 FI car to 120mph in 
five seconds. 

• At 19,000 RPM the following events occur in one second - 
The engine rotates 316.7 revolutions, the ignition system fires 
1,583 times, 9,500 engine speed measurements are made, 
the pistons covers a distance of 75 yards and nearly 140 gal¬ 
lons of air are drawn into the engine.

M Engines 


S85 

For the first time in a road-going BMW, a Formula 1 inspired V-10 
has been developed for the new M5 and M6. The S85 engine 
benefits from the knowledge gained from FI racing development. 



The all aluminum V-10 produces in excess of 500 horsepower at 
7750 RPM. One of the concepts adapted from FI is the “High 
RPM Power Concept” which allows the S85 to achieve a maximum 
RPM of 8250. 

Other features of the S85 include a light alloy, 2-piece crankcase 
which uses a bedplate design for additional reinforcement. The 
familiar High-Pressure Double VANOS is carried over from previous 
BMW Motorsport engine designs. 

The S85 is naturally aspirated and “breathes” through 10 individual 
throttle assemblies which are actuated by two throttle motors (One 
per bank). 


Together with all of the other engine concepts in this design, the 
S85 propels the E6x M5 and M6 to sub-5 second 0-60 mph 
times. The M5 offers the best power to weight ratio in comparison 
with the other vehicles in it’s class.

S65 

For the first time ever a V8 engine has been fitted in a series pro¬ 
duction M3. The main concept behind this high-rewing, high per¬ 
formance engine with a sporty sound is the extremely light, rigid 
and robust construction which is capable of reaching extreme 
engine speeds of up to 8,400 rpm. The engine achieves an 
impressive 414 hp (roughly 100 hp per liter). 

The S65B40 is derived from its big brother, the S85B50. The main 
changes can be seen in the engine oil system, VANOS valve gear 
system and air intake system. Special consideration has also been 
given to engine weight optimization. 


The engine with all its assemblies is built in the special engine pro¬ 
duction area of the Munich BMW plant. 

The M engineers consider the high engine speed concept to be 
the most intelligent strategy of obtaining the maximum thrust from 
a vehicle. 

For example, in a modern formula 1 engine, the crankshaft works at 
up to 19,000 rpm (resulting in piston speeds of over 25 meters per 
second).

The actual thrust at the driven wheels is the decisive factor for car The S65B40 attains 8,400 rpm, and therefore a value that was pre¬ 
acceleration. This thrust is achieved by the engine speed, the viously only reserved for racing car engines or exotic custom vehi- 

torque and the short gear ratio. cles. 


This concept has been adopted for vehicles in the M range from 
motor sport. The fully variable M limited-slip differential means that 
the thrust is optimally distributed to the live axle. 


Furthermore, the S65B40 also includes the established M-specific 
features such as double VANOS, individual throttle butterflies and 
high-performance engine electronics (MSS60 control unit).

Technical workarounds by increasing the cylinder capacity or 
boosting become excessive, thus avoiding the increased engine 
weight and consumption often associated with these methods. 


The high engine speed concept helps to achieve dynamically agile 
handling and the maximum in sports driving performance charac¬ 
teristics. 


A maximum torque of 400 Newton meters at 3,900 rpm is 
reached. Approx. 85 percent (340 Nm) can be utilized beyond 
the enormous engine speed range of 6,500 rpm.

Note: For safety reasons, due to the engine dynamics when 
the vehicle is stationary (i.e. without a road-speed 
signal), the rev limit is set to 7,000 rpm to prevent the 
engine from over revving.

S85B50 Engine 


Engine Block and Bedplate 


Similar in design to the N52 engine, the S85 takes advantage of 
the additional stiffening properties of the 2-piece crankcase. 



The 10 cylinder crankcase uses the familiar Alusil construction 
which is split at the crankshaft centerline. The bedplate is 
machined together with the crankcase and is mounted to the 
upper section of the crankcase when the engine is assembled. 
This design contributes to improved torsional stiffness. Better 
engine acoustics are also attributed to the improved stiffness. 


Some of the other benefits of the bedplate include the ability to 
accommodate additional assemblies and to facilitate the assembly 
of the crankshaft main bearings. 


The bedplate assembly contains cast iron bearing bridges which 
take up additional forces from the pistons and connecting rods. 
The engine serial number is stamped on the bedplate assembly. 


Cutaway of S85 Engine 



The bedplate is secured to the upper section of the crankcase 
with the main bearing bolts. The positions are fixed with fitted 
sleeves. Strict adherence to the bolt tightening procedure is nec¬ 
essary to prevent engine failure. 

Cutaway of S85 Engine 

























Bedplate Sealing 

As with the N52 engine, the S85 uses the same technique for bed¬ 
plate sealing. There is a machined groove (1) in the upper part of 
the crankcase. A liquid sealant is injected into the groove through 
ports (2) on each side of the crankcase. 



Oil Pan 

The oil pan is an all aluminum one-piece design. Due to the con¬ 
figuration of the front subframe crossmember, the pan has a front 
and rear sump. The oil pan provides the mounting for the electric 
oil pumps and the oil lines. When removing and installing the oil 
pan, note the location of the oil pan bolts. There are 4 different 
types of bolts, each requiring a specific installation location. 


Crankshaft 

The S85 crankshaft is forged steel and has 5 crankpins (journal) 
each offset 72 degrees apart. The crankshaft is also “nitro-carbur- 
ized” for increased surface hardness. 

The sprocket for the primary 
chain drive is integrally cast as 
part of the crankshaft. Also, the 
drive sprocket for that VANOS 
high pressure pump is bolted to 
the crankshaft snout. 

The color codes for the main 
bearing classification are 
stamped onto the crankshaft. 


The connecting rods weigh 582 
grams +/- 2 grams. The rods are 
also of asymmetrical construc¬ 
tion which allows for a narrower 
connecting rod. The narrower 
rods contribute to the overall 
reduction in engine length. The 
rods can only be installed one 
way. Refer to repair instructions 
during installation. 





Connecting Rods 

The connecting rods are forged 
steel and use the “cracked” configuration on the “big end”. For 
weight reduction, the small end of the connecting rod is trapezoidal 
and uses a tapered piston pin.

M Engines 


Pistons 

The pistons are cast from aluminum alloy. To promote the opti¬ 
mum friction partner with the cylinder bore, the piston skirt is coat¬ 
ed. There is a galvanic ferrous layer at a thickness of approximately 
10 microns. There is an additional tin layer of 2 microns that act as 
the run-in layer. 

Cylinder Head and Valvetrain 

The cylinder head is an aluminum one-piece design to improve 
overall rigidity. The idle air port and secondary air channel are inte¬ 
grated into the head. 

The familiar 4-valve per cylinder arrangement is used on the S85. 
However there are some additional refinements carried over from 
racing applications. 


Cylinder Head Cover 

The cylinder head cover is cast aluminum with provisions for 
mounting the ionic current control units as well as the camshaft 
sensors and components for the crankcase ventilation system. 

Valves 

Both the intake and exhaust valves are designed as solid valves 
with a 5mm stem diameter. The reduced stem diameter not only 
reduces weight, but also improves airflow qualities. 

The intake valve is a one-piece design made from a steel alloy 
(X45CrSi9-3). In contrast, the exhaust valve is a two piece design. 
The stem is made from the same steel alloy as the intake valve and 
is friction welded to the valve head, which is made from different 
alloy (NiCr20TiAI). 




Note: It is important to note that the valve guides are 
not replaceable and the cylinder head cannot 
be machined. 









Valve Springs 

The valve springs are the conical design familiar from past engine 
designs. 



The single row keeper is also 50% 
lighter than the three row design. In 
addition, the single row design pro¬ 
vides less stress on the 5mm valve 
stems for increased reliability. 


Valve Keepers 

The valve keepers are a single row design rather than the three row 
design. The single row design is a “clamping type” which prevent 
the valve from turning during engine operation. The valve turning 
method is not needed due to the 
clean efficient combustion and close \ \ 

production tolerances. 




Hydraulic Valve Actuators (HVA) 

The HVA assemblies are differently configured from past designs 
to save weight and improve the frictional characteristics. The new 
tappet design is referred to as the “box” type tappet. This style of 
tappet has been used in racing applications. The box tappet does 
not rotate in the cylinder head, therefore a groove is milled to pre¬ 
vent rotation. A corresponding “anti-torsion” pin is part of the tap¬ 
pet.

M Engines 


Camshaft 

The camshaft is a “hollow chill” casting (GGG60). In contrast to 
previous designs, the camshaft sensor trigger wheel is cast as one 
piece with the camshaft. An Ml 2X1 thread is integrated into the 
camshaft for the VANOS gear mounting. 



Camshaft Drive 

The primary camshaft drive is provided by two timing chains to 
drive the intake camshafts (one chain for each intake camshaft). 
The exhaust camshafts are driven by a “gear-to-gear” connection 
between the intake camshaft sprocket and the exhaust camshaft 
sprocket. 



VANOS 

The VANOS system on the S85 is carried over from previous “M- 
engine” designs with some minor changes. The adjustment range 
of the intake camshafts is 60 degrees of crankshaft angle and the 
exhaust camshaft can be adjusted up to 37 degrees (crankshaft). 

The S85 VANOS system is operated on the “high-pressure” 
concept which uses up to 115 bar for VANOS operation. 

The VANOS high pressure pump is driven directly from the crank¬ 
shaft via a gear-to-gear connection. The pressurized oil is routed 
from the pump via two delivery lines to the two VANOS units. 

A “T-connection” provides high pressure oil to the pressure 
accumulator. (See arrow below)

VANOS Actuators 

Separate adjustment units are provided for each cylinder bank for 
the purpose of adjusting the VANOS gear mechanism. These 
adjustment units are known as the actuators. The VANOS high 
pressure pump supplies them with oil under high pressure. 

Since the exhaust camshaft is driven via a gear-to-gear connection, 
the intake and exhaust camshaft rotate in opposing directions, the 
intake is adjusted towards advance and the exhaust towards retard 
when the plunger extends. (See arrows.) 


The adjustment pistons are designed as double-acting cylinders 
and differ with regard to the adjustment range for the intake and 
exhaust camshafts. 

The stroke range on the exhaust side of maximum 14.25 mm cor¬ 
responds to 18.5° camshaft angle (37° crankshaft angle). The 
stroke on the intake side of maximum 25.25 mm corresponds to 
30° camshaft angle (60° crankshaft angle).

When extended into the two piston chambers, the adjustment 
pistons are subject to a system pressure of 115 bar. They there¬ 
fore extend only due to the different piston surface areas. 



Stroke range of adjustment piston 


The oil from the small piston chamber is transferred into the high 
pressure circuit. The proportional valve must be fully actuated in 
order to extend the adjustment piston. 




* + 


Adjustment piston extending 


The holding function and piston retraction are achieved by reduc¬ 
ing the oil feed on the side with the largest piston surface area by 
partly actuating the proportional valve. 

The reduced oil feed decreases the oil pressure, thus initiating a 
change in the forces exerted on the adjustment pistons. 



Adjustment piston retracting 


The retraction movement of the adjustment pistons is supported 
by the camshafts as they push back the spline shafts in the 
hydraulic units due to the helical gearing in the VANOS gear 
mechanism.

VANOS Gear Mechanism 

The VANOS gear mechanism (transmission) connects the crank¬ 
shaft with the intake camshafts via a chain sprocket. The intake 
VANOS gear mechanism also provides the drive mechanism for the 
exhaust camshaft via a gear-to-gear connection. The gear mecha¬ 
nism also permits "torsion" of the camshafts. The gear mecha¬ 
nisms for the intake and exhaust sides differ in terms of the exterior 
structure of the gear and chain drive while the adjustment mecha¬ 
nism on the inner side is identical. 


The gear mechanism is driven by the drive gearwheel that interacts 
with the helical gearing on the inner sleeve. The threaded connec¬ 
tions for the gearing connects the inner sleeve to the outer sleeve. 
With (wide) helical gearing, the inner sleeve acts on the bearing 
assembly for the drive gearwheel that is firmly secured to the 
camshaft with the central bolt.

The actuator (adjustment unit) is connected to the outer and inner sleeve by the screw connection of the gear mechanism. During adjust¬ 
ment, the inner sleeve and outer sleeve are pulled out of and pushed into the gear mechanism. 

The inner sleeve is turned by the helical gearing on the "fixed" drive gearwheel (timing chain drive). Due to the non-positive screw con¬ 
nection of the outer sleeve, this sleeve also turns. In connection with a further helical gear, the outer sleeve now turns the bearing for the 
drive gearwheel and in turn the camshaft connected with the central bolt. 

The gear units are mounted in their base position, i.e. pulled apart. The camshafts are adjusted when the gear units are pushed together. 
The drive gearwheel and bearing for the drive gearwheel are connected by a torsion spring to assist the return movement.

The mounting screws for the gear mechanism are tightened only 
lightly when assembling the actuators. As a result, no force is 
transmitted from the outer sleeve to the inner sleeve when sliding 
the actuators onto the cylinder head (to facilitate the sliding move¬ 
ment of the gear unit). Due to the "fixed" drive gearwheel, the 
outer sleeve turns in the direction of engine rotation. At the same 
time the "fixed" bearing for the drive gearwheel turns the inner 
sleeve opposite the direction of engine rotation. 

The exhaust camshaft is driven by the intake camshaft in connec¬ 
tion with a gear drive mechanism. The drive gearwheel is split in 
two in order to avoid gearing noises caused by a change in the 
driving tooth profile in connection with a change in load. A disc 
spring turns the two halves of the gearwheel in opposing directions 
(functional principle similar to dual-mass flywheel) so that both 
tooth profiles of the exhaust gearwheel always rest on the intake 
gearwheel under all load conditions.

VANOS High Pressure Pump 

The high pressure pump is designed as a radial piston pump with 
five pump plungers. It is driven via a gear mechanism directly by 
the crankshaft. To avoid gearing noise, when mounting the sprock¬ 
et of the high pressure pump, the coated part must face towards 
the crankshaft without any clearance. The correct gear clearance is 
then established automatically by the coating scraping off. 


The high pressure pump receives its oil supply from the bedplate. 
An 80 micron fine filter is installed in the transition hole from the 
bedplate to the high pressure pump. This filter has the sole pur¬ 
pose of holding back any impurities that may accumulate during 
series production and is not replaced during vehicle operation. 



M Engines 

29 
















































A feed valve in the high pressure pump ensures a constant supply 
of oil over the entire pressurized engine oil range. 


30 

M Engines 



The high pressure pump consists of the fixed stator about which 
the rotor rotates. Five moving plungers are mounted in the rotor. 
The stator and rotor are installed off-center in the pump housing. 
The plungers are guided radially as the rotor rotates thus producing 
the pump stroke motion.

The pressure relief valve integrated in the high pressure pump 
opens in response to pressure peaks in the high pressure system 
and opens up a bypass to the oil pan. 

The oil pressurized at 115 bar is routed via three delivery lines to 
the two VANOS control units and to the pressure accumulator.

Lubrication System 

The S85 is equipped with a quasi-dry sump. For this reason, a 
suction pump is used to pump the oil out of the oil pan in the area 
ahead of the rack and pinion power steering gear into the rear oil 
sump. From here, a controllable slide valve pump conveys the oil 
at a maximum pressure of 5 bar into the oil filter. A thermostat that 
enables the path to the engine cooler is additionally located in the 
oil filter head. 

The oil is then routed from the oil filter into the engine. Here it is 
divided over three lines to the two cylinder heads and to the 
crankcase. 


A special feature of this system are the two electrically driven oil 
pumps that are located on the left and right of the oil pan. The 
electric oil pumps start up at a transverse acceleration of 0.8 G and 
pump the oil from the cylinder heads which, under these centrifu¬ 
gal force conditions, would otherwise no longer flow back into the 
oil pan. 

The crankcase is ventilated by a cyclone separator in the intake air 
manifold. The return flow line from the oil separator and the con¬ 
densation return flow lines from the intake air manifolds are routed 
along the 6-10 cylinder bank of the crankcase into the oil sump. 









Oil Pumps 

Due to the race-inspired design of the S85 engine, the lubrication 
system has been adapted to meet the oiling needs during all oper¬ 
ating conditions. 

The primary oil pump is driven from a chain connected to the high 
pressure VANOS pump (which is driven via the gear-to-gear con¬ 
nection with the crankshaft). The oil pump housing accommo¬ 
dates two oil pumps. One of the pumps is a duocentric design 
which pumps oil from the front oil sump to the rear oil sump. This 
ensures that oil is in the rear sump at all times especially during 
hard braking. 



The other pump is a slide-valve design which has a variable dis¬ 
placement capability. The slide valve pump takes the oil from the 
rear sump and conveys it to the oil filter at a variable pressure of up 
to 5 bar. 



Duocentric Oil Pump 



Slide Valve Oil Pump 


M Engines 

33

M Engines 


The pump outlet is determined by the eccentricity of the pendulum-type slide valve. No oil is delivered when the pump runs centrally 
with respect to the rotor as all pump chambers are the same size. 

The slide valve is displaced by an inclined piston. This piston is in equilibrium between the piston spring and the engine oil pressure. 

The greater the engine oil pressure, the more the piston is pressed against the spring and the more the slide valve turns in the direction 
of 0 delivery. 



Low pressure scenario 


High pressure scenario 








































































Electric Oil Pumps 

When cornering at high speeds, the centrifugal force forces the 
engine oil into the outer cylinder head so that it can no longer flow 
back into the oil pan on its own. 

It must therefore be pumped off by the respective oil pump and 
returned to the oil sump. The electric oil pumps are activated by 
the engine control unit which determines the cornering speed with 
a yaw rate sensor. 

The electric oil pumps are protected by heat shields from the heat 
radiated from the exhaust manifolds. 


Oil Filter Housing 

A thermostat that opens the path to the engine oil cooler is mount¬ 
ed in the head of the oil filter housing. 

The filter housing is located behind the front bumper on the right 
side, near the secondary air pump. 

The underbody panels must be removed during an oil service to 
access the oil filter. 



Oil Spray Nozzles 

Double-hook oil spray nozzles are used on the S85 for the purpose 
of cooling the piston crown. The oil spray nozzle is equipped with 
an integrated pressure control valve. 

Opening pressure: 1.8 to 2.2 bar 

Closing pressure: 1.3 to 1.9 bar

Cooling System 

The cooling system uses the cross-flow technique, however there 
are some changes over previous systems. For instance, each 
cylinder head has its own radiator feed and the coolant thermostat 
is located in the return flow line. 

The radiator is divided into an upper and lower water tank. Coolant 
emerges from the Bank II (6-10) cylinder head through the upper 
water tank. Bank I (1 -5) flows through the lower water tank. 

The split cooler design makes it necessary to provide three bleeder 
opening and two bleeder lines to ensure adequate self-bleeding of 
the system. 

The tap-off point for the heating system is located at the rear of the 
cylinder heads. The heating return line and the line to the expan¬ 
sion tank merge at a “T-connection” ahead of the water pump. 



Radiator 

The radiator of the S85 is divided into an upper and a lower tank. 
The lower tank serves the purpose of cooling the coolant from 
Bank I (Cyl 1 -5) while the upper water tank is responsible for cool¬ 
ing the cylinder Bank II (Cyl 6-10). 

Due to the split design, it has been possible to reduce the pressure 
drop in the radiator from approximately 3 bar to approximately 1.4 
bar. 

Thermostat 

Due to the two-part cooling concept, the thermostat has been relo¬ 
cated to the return line. It is designed as a conventional thermostat 
that opens at a temperature of 79°C. 

The coolant from the cylinder head enters the outlet for the radiator 
feed and from here it is routed both via the double o-ring carrier 
into the thermostat as well as into the coolant supply hoses. 

Water Pump 

The water pump is belt driven and it is located directly below the 
thermostat housing. 








Throttle Valves 

10 individual throttle valves control the air supply for the S85. The 
individual throttle valves of each cylinder bank are operated sepa¬ 
rately by an actuator unit and operating shaft. The actuator motors 
operate independently. 

The throttle valves are set with respect to each other (as on S54). 
There are no facilities for the synchronization of the cylinder banks 
with respect to each other as well as for setting the full load stop. 
The necessary corrections are undertaken by the engine manage¬ 
ment (see section entitled Engine Management MS S65). 



M 


Idle Control 

The idle speed is controlled by two idle speed actuators that route 
the intake air from the intake air manifolds directly into the idle air 
port of the respective cylinder head. Each cylinder bank is con¬ 
trolled individually.

Secondary Air System 

In order to comply with LEV II standards, the S85 uses a secondary 
air system. The secondary air system helps reduce HC emissions 
during the cold start period. The catalyst warm-up time is also 
reduced. 

The secondary air is injected into the exhaust ports via pressure 
controlled diaphragm valves on the cylinder heads. The air from 
the secondary air pump is routed through channels in the cylinder 
heads. 



Exhaust System 

The S85 is equipped with stainless steel exhaust manifolds. The 
manifolds are “hydroformed” and feature equal length tubes with a 
wall thickness of 0.8 mm. The tubes are configured as a 5-into-1 
design with one “near-engine” catalyst per cylinder bank. 

There are 2 pre-catalyst oxygen sensors for mixture control which 
are Bosch LSU 4.9. The two post-catalyst 02 sensors are Bosch 
LSF25.

S65B40 Engine 


Engine Block with Bedplate Construction 

The construction and materials used on the E65 engine of the 
E9X M3 are identical to the S85 engine on the M5/M6. 



The upper low-pressure die-cast crankcase is made from an 
aluminum-silicon alloy. 

The cylinder bores are formed using exposed hard silicon crystals, 
rendering the use of cylinder liners unnecessary. 

The lower crankcase (bedplate) is also constructed using die-cast 
aluminum. Due to the extreme forces, grey cast iron inlays are 
used to reinforce the bedplate construction. 

These also limit crankshaft bearing clearances over a greater tem¬ 
perature range and thus have a positive effect on the oil flow rate.

Crankshaft 


Connecting Rods 


The five-bearing crankshaft is forged from a single piece, including 
the two double-chain gears for driving the valve train. The gear 
wheel for the oil pump drive is flange mounted. 

The E65 crankshaft possesses high torsional strength at a relative¬ 
ly low weight. 

The crank pin offset is 90° and the cylinder spacing is 98mm. 

The crankshaft end play is controlled by a thrust bearing located at 
the fifth main bearing. 

The diameter of the main bearing journal is 60 mm. 

For design reasons, the firing order 1 -5-4-8-7-2-6-3 was chosen 
for the S65, instead of the 1 -5-4-8-6-3-7-2 firing order more com¬ 
monly employed in BMW V8 engines. 



The high tensile steel connecting rods are cold cracked. 

The upper (small end) section of the connecting rod has a 
trapezoidal shaped design for weight reduction while the large end 
of the connecting rod is asymmetrically ground to reduce the total 
length of the engine. This means that the instalation of the 
connecting rods is direction-specific. 

Note: The identification marking of the bearing shells is 
engraved on the crankcase and on the first crank 
web. For further information, see the service 
documentation available on TIS or ISTA. 


Pistons 


The piston design is the same as the S85 piston. 

Pistons are manufactured from a cast aluminum alloy and weigh 
approximately 480 grams including wrist pin and piston rings. 

As on the S85 the pistons have a galvanized iron coating 
[Ferrostan] and a running-in layer containing tin. 


The installation position of the 
pistons is direction-specific.

Two oil pumps are installed in the S65 engine; the oil return pump, 
which is driven via a gearwheel by the crankshaft, and the volume 
flow-controlled main oil pump, driven via chain drive by the oil 
return pump. 

In the S85, the VANOS high pressure pump is installed instead of 
the S65 oil return pump, and the S85 oil return pump is contained 
in a housing together with the main oil pump (tandem pump). 

Since there is no space to install a tandem pump in the S65, the oil 
return pump has been moved from the main oil pump housing and 
installed instead of the VANOS high-pressure pump. This allows 
the pump drive principle (crankshaft => gearwheel => pump => 
chain => pump) to be maintained. As in the S85, the volume flow- 
controlled main oil pump is a hinged-valve oil pump with a feed 
capacity adjusted to suit the VANOS low-pressure system. 

The duocentric design of the oil return pump ensures that oil is 
always available at the inlet pipe of the main oil pump in the rear 
area of the oil pan, even when braking sharply from high speeds. 

The electrical oil return pumps installed in the S85 for scavenging 
the cylinder heads are no longer required, which results in a further 
weight saving. This is made possible by the lower number of cylin¬ 
ders, modification of the oil return routes, and the large capacity of 
the oil pan. 

The oil pan has a capacity of 8.3 liters (S85 9.3 liters). 

The oil supply is also guaranteed at extreme longitudinal and lateral 
accelerations of up to 1.4 times the normal gravitational accelera¬ 
tion. 

The oil filter housing is installed on the engine.

Cylinder Head 

The cylinder head is constructed from a single piece of aluminum 
alloy. To reduce the number of sealing faces, the secondary air 
channel has been integrated back into the cylinder head. 

The design of the cylinder head is based on the S85 engine. 
Compared to the S85, changes have been made in the front of the 
engine, the VANOS system and the timing chain. 


Compared to the S85, the intake and exhaust tracts airflow has 
been optimized. The integrated idle air channel has been discon¬ 
tinued and replaced by an idle air bar for each cylinder bank. 

As in the S85, the camshafts are manufactured as a hollow-cast, 
one-piece construction with integrated sensor gears.

Hydraulic Bucket Tappet 

As on the S85, the S65 uses weight-optimized valves with a 5mm 
stem diameter and bucket tappets with hydraulic valve clearance 
adjustment. 

The convex camshaft contact surface and the integrated rotational 
lock of the hydraulic tappets provide excellent camshaft following 
with limited valve rotation. This results in effective valve lift charac¬ 
teristics with the smallest possible tappet diameter and a reduction 
in valve train total mass, (ideal for high engine speeds).

Camshaft Drive 

As in the S85, the intake camshafts are driven by chain drive and 
the exhaust camshafts are driven by a gearwheel drive. This means 
that the intake and exhaust camshafts always have an opposite 
direction of rotation. In contrast to the S85, which works with 
two single-roller chains between the crankshaft and the intake 
camshafts, in the S65, two double-roller chains are used. 

This is because of the higher chain drive load in the V8. 

The VANOS adjustment units are an integral component of the 
valve control and are mounted on the relevant camshaft by a 
central bolt.

VANOS 


The compact double VANOS system fitted to the S65 engine 
operates at normal oil pressure, unlike the S85 engine (which uses 
high oil pressure). 

The low-pressure system means that the high-pressure pump, 
additional pressure lines and reservoir are unnecessary. This 
results in a space saving as well as a weight reduction of approxi¬ 
mately 8.4 kg/18.5 lb. The use of low pressure VANOS is made 
possible by the considerably stronger torque variations at the 


S65B40 VANOS

V 


camshaft compared to the 10 and 6-cylinder engines, 
particularly in the lower engine speed range. The low-pressure 
system uses these torque variations to adjust the overall VANOS 
gear ratio. 

The oil is directed to the sealed oil chambers 3 and 4 (see below) 
of the VANOS adjustment unit. 

When the chambers are pressurized with oil pressure, one cham¬ 
ber allows the camshaft to advance while the other chamber allows 
the camshaft to retard.

The VANOS oil pressure is supplied by the engine’s main oil pump. 
The VANOS oil flow is controlled by one multi-way valve for each 
camshaft. These VANOS multi-way valves are controlled by the 
MSS60 and are directly installed in the cylinder head. 

As in the S85, the VANOS adjustment unit of the intake camshaft 
drives the VANOS adjustment unit of the exhaust camshaft by 
means of a constantly meshed gear.

At zero pressure, a locking pin (2) (see below) holds the VANOS 
unit in the “normal” or engine start position. 

The spiral-wound spring (3) is also used for coordinating the 
adjustment time between the advance and retard adjustment. In 
contrast to other BMW engines, the spiral wound spring for the 
intake and exhaust sides is mounted in the opposite working 
direction, since the camshafts in the S65 rotate in the opposite 
direction. 

The design principle of the M VANOS hydraulic motor is based on 
the VANOS system in current BMW engines and is optimized for 
the S65 in terms of oil supply, drainage diameters and in rotor sur¬ 
face area.

The setting angle of the intake camshaft is 58° in relation to crank¬ 
shaft rotation. The exhaust camshaft has a setting angle of 48° in 
relation to crankshaft rotation. As in the S85 engine, this VANOS 
also reaches an adjustment rate of 360° camshaft per second. 


Note: The VANOS adjustment unit must NEVER be 

disassembled, once apart they must be replaced. 
Always follow the proper service and repair 
instructions.

Individual Throttle Body System 

The design principle of the S65 individual throttle valve air intake 
system is the same as the S85 and consists of eight individual 
throttle valve assemblies and two electrical throttle valve actuators. 
One electric throttle valve positioner activates four individual throttle 
butterflies of one cylinder bank, which are mechanically coupled. 
The throttle valve position for each cylinder bank is recorded using 
a double throttle valve sensor on the shared throttle body shaft. 


A signal is sent directly to the throttle valve actuator responsible for 
this cylinder bank. The throttle valve actuator can therefore inde¬ 
pendently adjust the throttle valve position specified by the 
MSS60. 

The second signal is sent to the MSS60 for checking purposes. 

For communication with the MSS60, the two electrical throttle 
valve actuators use a shared DK-CAN bus (DK-CAN).

Air Intake System 

The combustion air enters the engine via three flow-optimized air 
guides. An air inlet is located on the left side of the hood (driver 
side). To maintain an optical balance in the appearance of the 
engine hood, another intake grill is located on the right side, but 
this is blind and does not perform any function. 

The second air inlet is located behind the kidney grills of the BMW 
kidney. 

The third air inlet is located on the lower left corner of the front 
bumper. 

The S65 has a large, single-piece intake air collector that combines 
both cylinder banks. 



A cylindrical air filter element (4) with an enlarged surface area is 
used. 

The filtered airflows into the intake manifold, through eight inte¬ 
grated individual inlet pipes and into the individual throttle valve 
assemblies. 

To optimize air resistance, no air-mass sensor is installed in the 
intake area. 

The airflow is determined using a model based calculation from 
the opening of the throttle valve assemblies and the idle speed 
actuator; The VANOS adjustment position, engine speed, air tem¬ 
perature and the atmospheric pressure are also factors. 

For safety reasons, an additional pressure sensor is mounted in the 
idle speed system (see idle speed control).

Idle Control System 

One common idle speed actuator for both cylinder banks controls 
the air supply at idle speed and at low engine loads. The idle 
speed actuator is located in the V formed by the two cylinder 
banks, and controls the idle air supply using a throttle valve. The air 
enters the shared bar for each cylinder bank via the relevant air 
ducts, and from there is guided into each throttle body below the 
throttle valve. 

The idle speed actuator receives control instructions from the 
MSS60 via its own local CAN bus (LoCAN). 

To ensure emergency operation in the event of the failure of one or 
both throttle valve sensors (even without the hot film air-mass sen¬ 
sor), an additional pressure sensor is integrated on the idle air bar 
(as in the S54B32HP (M3 CSL)). This allows evaluation of the 
pressure conditions behind the throttle valves. This pressure is 
also used for the plausibility check of filling and load in normal 
operation.

Secondary Air System 

The secondary air pump is mounted on the rear of the engine in 
the "V" of the cylinder banks. The secondary air is guided into the 
relevant exhaust channel via a check valve and an air channel inte¬ 
grated in the cylinder head. 

An upstream secondary air pump hot-film air mass sensor meas¬ 
ures the secondary airflow. The structure and function are the 
same as the system in the E60 M5. 

Oil Separators 

The oil separators are bolted onto the cylinder head covers. The 
connection between the oil separator and the intake manifold is not 
screwed but plugged. This reduces the risk of incorrect assembly. 

As is typical for the M series, no crankcase pressure control is 
mounted/integrated. 
















Cooling System 

The mechanical coolant pump was taken from the S85. 

The water pump belt pulley has been adapted due to the reduced 
water flow rate in the S65 compared with the S85. It has a larger 
diameter, which has allowed a reduction in pump speed. 

A one-piece crossflow radiator is used to cool both banks, unlike 
the S85 engine which has a two-piece radiator, one part for each 
bank.

The main belt drive drives the coolant pump and the generator, 
while the auxiliary belt drive drives the air conditioning compressor 
and the power-assisted steering pump. 

The generator and the coolant pump are in the same position as in 
the S85. The coolant pump is identical to the S85, but has a larger 
belt pulley. 



Fuel System 

The fuel tank is based on the series production E92 tank, although 
the shape has been changed to accommodate the exhaust system. 
Both in tank units are newly designed. The fuel pump is installed in 
the right side unit, and the pressure regulator is installed in the left¬ 
side unit in front of the fuel filter. 


The ventilation lines have been adapted, while all other lines have 
been taken from the E92 335i. The US release is fitted with a tank 
leakage diagnosis unit.

Exhaust System 

The exhaust pipes of the M vehicles are manufactured using the innovative internal high pressure forming technology (IHU). Using the IHU 
technology, the seamless stainless steel exhaust pipes are formed under a pressure of up to 800 bar. This results in extremely thin wall 
thicknesses of between 0.65 and 1.0 millimeters, which means both the weight of the exhaust system and the response characteristics of 
the catalytic converters can be optimized. At the same time, the IHU technology enables unprecedented styling and even more efficient 
geometric tolerances. 


The largest possible pipe cross-sections are used, thus minimizing 
flow resistance. The complete exhaust system is manufactured in 
stainless steel and has a dual flow. 

The 4-in-1 exhaust manifold in each cylinder bank, as used in 
motor sport, has a length and cross-section designed to enable 
optimal use of dynamics in the exhaust flow and to avoid unneces¬ 
sary exhaust backpressure. 

The exhaust system has one quick responding metal catalytic con¬ 
verter close to the engine per exhaust line, (approx. 20 cm behind 
the exhaust manifold), followed by the metal main catalytic convert¬ 
er. The front silencer and the final muffler shared by both exhaust 
lines with a volume of 35 liters are constructed in an absorption 
design. 

The lambda oxygen sensors are located before and after both 
engine-side catalytic converters. The exhaust temperature sensor 
installed in previous M models is no longer required and is 
replaced by an internal calculation model in the control device. 

The S65 fulfills the requirements of the LEV 2 classification. 

Note: At maximum operating temperatures, the entire 
exhaust system can expand in length by 35 mm.

M Engines 


The S54B32 engine is an in-line 6 cylinder power plant. This 
3246 cc displacement engine is used in the M Roadster and M 
Coupe. 

The S54B32 is a 4-valve per cylinder dual VANOS naturally aspi¬ 
rated engine with high torque and high-rev concepts. High torque 
is developed by a large volume engine at low engine rpm and a 
long total gear ratio. 


High-revs are achieved with a small displacement “lightweight” 
(internal components) engine and short total gear ratio. This pow¬ 
ertrain provides the best of both worlds by using a 3.2 Liter in-line 
6 cylinder configuration coupled to a 6 speed manual transmis¬ 
sion.

Engine Block 

The S54 engine block is cast iron in order to absorb the high 
forces produced by the crankshaft (combustion pressure and high 
engine rpm). 

The engine block has cast provisions for 3 Knock Sensors and the 
Crankshaft Position/RPM Sensor (on the intake side). 

The cylinder bores are 87 mm in diameter and are spaced 91 mm 
on center. 

The “bare” block weighs approximately 105 lbs. (48 kg). 



Crankshaft and Bearings 

The S54 crankshaft is forged steel with 12 counterweights and a 
91 mm stroke. The crankshaft is supported by 7 (60 mm diameter) 
main bearings with 49 mm diameter connecting rod journals. 

The “thrust” bearing is a multi-piece shell assembled as a unit and 
is located on the number 6 main journal of the crankshaft. 



Bearing Clearance 

• Main 0.02 - 0.05 mm 

• Thrust (end play) 0.08 - 0.16 mm

Connecting Rods and Bearings 


Pistons and Piston Rings 



The S54 uses reinforced forged steel “cracked” 


The “cracked” connecting rod refers to the cap which is split off 
leaving rough surfaces on both the cap and the rod. 

Centering of the cap on the rod is carried out through the structure 
of the split which eliminates the alignment sleeves. Pairing codes 
are stamped into the rod to ensure proper installation of the cap. 


The S54 uses graphite coated cast aluminum (full slipper skirt) 
pistons with valve recesses. 

The piston diameter is 86.965 
mm, weighs approximately 470 
grams with a compression ratio of 
11.5:1. 

Install the pistons with the arrow 
pointing towards the front of the 
engine. 

A Special Tool (ring compressor) is 
required to install the pistons. 

The pistons are cooled by oil spra; 
nozzles that are bolted into the 
crankcase. 



The S54 connecting rods are weight-optimized (+/- 4 grams). Only 
one set of connecting rods (the same weight class) is available to 
maintain balance. 


The connecting rod bolts must 
be angle torqued (refer to Repair 
Instructions and Technical Data). 
The bolts can not be replaced 
separately, if damaged; the con¬ 
necting rod must be replaced 
(supplied with new bolts). 

The S54 connecting rod bear¬ 
ings use end mounted locating 
tabs. 



The nozzles are “tapped” into the 
main oil gallery and delivers a con¬ 
stant oil spray to the underside of 
the pistons. 

The wrist pins are 21 mm in diam¬ 
eter and have tapered ends (inside 
diameter) for weight reduction. 
































Testing Oil Pressure 


Oil Pump 

The S54 oil pump is two stage, supply and scavenge. The pump is _ . , 

driven by the crankshaft with a single row chain. ^he 01 P ressure IS tested at the oil filter housing using the Special 

Tool #90 88 6 114 390 (adapting retainer bolt and pressure gauge 
The oil pump has two separate chambers, the scavenge chamber as shown in the Repair Instructions). 

(1) draws oil from the pickup at the front of the oil pan. The oil is 
transferred from the pump through a small pipe to the main sump 
at the rear of the oil pan (2). 

The supply chamber (3) draws oil from the main sump through a 
large pipe (4) to supply oil to the main gallery. The main gallery cir¬ 
cuit returns to the pump housing which contains the oil pressure 
control piston. 



The adapter retainer bolt replaces the oil filter housing cover retain¬ 
ing bolt and provides an adapter fitting for the oil pressure gauge.

The crankcase blow-by vapors are “purged” by intake manifold vac¬ 
uum. The vapors are drawn from the cylinder head cover (4) 
through the inlet of the Oil Separator (6). The Labyrinth (3) sepa¬ 
rates the oil from the vapors, and the condensate (oil) returns to the 
oil pan through the return line (9). The vapors exit the Oil Separator 
through the outlet hose (7) to the intake manifold to be inducted 
into the combustion chambers. 


Crankcase Ventilation 


The S54 features a non-pressurized sealed crankcase ventilation 
system for the blow-by vapors. 


When the engine is running, intake manifold vacuum will close the 
Check Valve in the return line (8). When the engine is not running, 
the Check Valve will open. This allows any condensation (oil) that 
have collected in the intake manifold to drain back to the oil pan 
through the dipstick tube. 

The cylinder head cover is sealed by a perimeter seal, spark plug 
port seals and sealing washers under the retaining bolts. 

These individual seals must all be properly installed to prevent oil 
and vacuum leaks.

Cylinder Head 

The S54 features an aluminum cross-flow cylinder head that hous¬

The combustion chamber reveals the 4 valve per cylinder arrange¬ 
ment and the optimized (flow enhanced) intake and exhaust ports. 
The spark plugs are centrally located in the combustion area for the 
most effective power and reduced emission outputs. 


To remove the cylinder head, the camshafts must first be removed 
to access the cylinder head bolts (refer to the Repair Instructions). 
The timing chain guide rail bolt (1) must also be removed (see 
below) and the special sealing washer must be replaced. 

To pressure test the cylinder head, a new Special Tool 
(Pressure Tester Adapter Kit) is required. 

Note: Cylinder head machining is not permitted. 





Camshaft Drive 

The camshafts are driven by the crankshaft using a double-roller 
timing chain. 

The chain is routed from the crankshaft over a guide rail to the 
intake and exhaust camshaft sprockets. A two piece hydraulically 
tensioned guide rail lubricates (three oil holes) and “self adjusts” 
the chain.

Camshafts 


The S54 cast iron overhead camshafts are hollow and are 
strengthened by heat treating the journals and cam lobes. 
The duration and lift (12 mm) of the lobes are the same on 
both camshafts. 





The camshafts are not interchangeable, therefore they should be 
marked before disassembly. 


The camshafts must be removed and 
installed with the press fixture 
(Special Tool as shown in the Repair 
Instructions). 


The camshafts are “timed” with the 
bridged location tool (pinned into 
camshaft as shown in the Repair 
Instructions). 


The camshaft lobes have oil grooves 
that provide lubrication from the 
camshaft journals to the lobes and 
the valve fingers. 






























The first camshaft bearing journal also serves as the thrust bearing 
(unmarked). 

This two-piece bearing flange is forged to support VANOS axial 
loads. 

The thrust bearing flange is bolted to 
the face of the cylinder head. This 
component is not separately available 
because the journals are machined 
with the cylinder head. 

Valve Train 


The shims (arrow) are available in sizes from 1.72 to 2.52 mm 
at 0.04 mm increments 


The camshaft lobe actuates the valve finger (rocker arm) which 
rotates on a finger (rocker) shaft. The valve finger is secured by a 
spring clip and contacts the valve clearance shim (9 mm diameter) 
to open the valve. 




The adjustable valve clearance set by various shim thickness is: 

• Intake 0.18 - 0.23mm 

• Exhaust 0.28 - 0.33mm 

Note: Set With Engine Temperature < 35° C/95°F 

Two feeler gages and a holder with a magnetic tip (Special Tools) 
are required to adjust the valve clearance. The cam lobe must be 
rotated away from the valve finger for maximum clearance. 

To access the valve clearance shim, remove the finger securing 
clip. Slide the finger away from the valve spring to expose the shim. 
Use the magnetic tip holder to extract the shim.

The valve fingers are identical but must be marked for location 
when previously used. 

Lubrication for the slide contact is provided from the camshafts 
(lobe grooves) and an inlet hole (arrow) allows lubrication for the 
finger pivot journal. 


Both finger shafts are hollow, the exhaust shaft is unique because it 
supplies oil to the cam-shaft bearing journals. 

The exhaust shaft receives oil from the main oil gallery through the 
transfer hole (arrow). 

The intake camshaft is lubricated directly from the main oil gallery. 




Valves 


The intake and exhaust valves are lightweight in design to reduce 
reciprocating mass. 

The valve specifications are: 

• Intake 35 mm 

• Exhaust 30.5 mm 

• Stem-Intake / Exhaust 6.0 mm 



Valve Springs 

The valve spring assembly consists of two progressive wound valve 
springs. 

The springs are marked for correct installation due to progressive 
winding (paint stripes facing down towards cylinder head). 



The exhaust valve stems are sodium filled to enhance cooling. 


CAUTION!!! 


Consult the Repair Instructions before 
performing any repairs and for proper 
disposal of sodium filled valves.

VANOS 


Performance, torque, idle characteristics and exhaust emissions 
reduction are improved by variable camshaft timing (VANOS). 

The S54 engine uses double VANOS to adjust the spread angles 
of the intake and exhaust camshafts. 

This system uses a high pressure (100 Bar) control system that 
ensures responsive and accurate camshaft adjustments to meet 
the high performance requirements of the M3.

Engines 


VANOS Unit 

The Vanos unit is mounted directly on the front of the cylinder 
head. 



The VANOS unit contains the hydraulically actuated mechanical 
drives (1), the electronically controlled oil pressure regulating sole¬ 
noids (2) and the 100 Bar pressure regulating valve (3). 

The view of the VANOS unit shows the inlet oil supply pressure 
reducing valve (4) and the radial piston high pressure output pump 
driven by the exhaust camshaft (5). 

The VANOS solenoid electrical assembly (re-moved from the 
VANOS unit) contains four solenoids. 

Two solenoids are required for each adjusting piston circuit, one for 
advancing and one for retarding the camshaft timing. The solenoids 
are controlled by the DME (ECM). 























The adjustment shafts contain two sets of splines. The straight 
splines engage with the camshaft sleeves and the helical spline 
engage with the chain driven cam sprocket. 



The camshaft sleeves are bolted to the end of the camshafts and 
engage with the straight spline of the adjustment shaft shown 
above. 


The chain driven sprocket and spacer sleeve assembly is shown to 
the right (one assembly per camshaft). The sprocket engages with 
the helical splines of the adjustment shaft. 

The exhaust sprocket assembly has two drive “lugs” that must be 
aligned with the radial piston pump during installation. 




M Engines

M Engines 


VANOS mechanical operation is dependent on oil pressure applied 
to position the control pistons. The double VANOS camshafts are 
infinitely adjustable within the mechanical travel limits of the drive 
gears. 

When oil pressure is applied to the control piston, the piston moves 
causing the splined adjustment shaft to move. The straight splines 
slide within the camshaft sleeve. The helical splines rotate the 
camshaft drive sprocket changing the position in relation to the 
camshaft position which advances/retards the camshaft timing. 


The default (mechanical stop) camshaft position without VANOS 
influence is: 

• Intake Camshaft = Retarded (130° spread angle) 

• Exhaust Camshaft = Advance (83° spread angle) 

The VANOS enhanced camshaft spread angles are: 

• Intake 70-130 

• Exhaust 83-128 


The total adjustment range of the camshafts are 60° for the intake 
and 45° for the exhaust. 



















Oil is supplied from main gallery through the front of cylinder head 
(arrow) to the inlet pressure reducing valve. 



The pressure reducing valve supplies oil to the radial piston high 
pressure pump. It is located between the cylinder head and the 
VANOS unit. 




The valve ensures the oil pressure supply to the VANOS pump is 
0.5 Bar regardless of the varying pressure from the main oil pres¬ 
sure gallery. The pressure reducing valve is pressed into the 
VANOS unit and secured by an “o-ring”. 



M 


The 100 Bar pressure regulating valve is mounted in the VANOS 
unit. This valve regulates the pressure produced by the radial 
piston high pressure pump. 

Note: The 100 Bar pressure regulating valve is NOT 
adjustable. 



The 100 Bar pressure accumulator ensures that there is a suffi¬ 
cient volume of oil under pressure to adjust the camshafts under all 
engine operating conditions. 

The accumulator is Nitrogen charged and is located on the exhaust 
side of the engine behind the A/C compressor. It is connected to 
the VANOS unit by a high pressure line.

VANOS system hydraulic operation: 

• When the engine starts, oil from the main engine oil pump is 
fed under pressure to the pressure reducing valve. 

• The oil pressure is dropped to approximately 0.5 Bar and fed 
to the radial piston high pressure oil pump. 

• The pump is driven by the exhaust camshaft and the 100 Bar 
pressure is built up by the pressure regulating valve. The vol¬ 
ume of pressurized oil is stored in the accumulator supplying 
both adjustment pistons. Both pistons are held in the default 
position by the high pressure oil. 

• At the same time the high pressure oil is available at the inlet 
solenoids of both adjustment pistons. 

• VANOS adjustment is carried out by the ECM pulsing the inlet 
and outlet solenoids to allow pressurized oil to the back side 
of the adjustment pistons. The surface area on this side of the 
piston is larger so that the oil pressure is greater and the 
adjustment piston will move causing the valve timing to 
change. 

• The piston is connected to the adjustment shaft. As the pis¬ 
ton moves, the shaft turns the helical splines varying the 
camshaft sprocket position in relation to the camshafts. 


CAUTION!!! 


The VANOS system is under high 
pressure (100 Bar). Always consult the 
Repair Instructions before performing 
any repairs.

Workshop Hints 

When installing the intake camshaft, a visual “sight” is the cam 
lobes on cylinder number 1 should be pointing horizontally inwards 
(as shown on the right). 

When installing the exhaust 
camshaft, the cam lobes for cylinder 
number 1 should be pointing hori¬ 
zontally inwards (refer to Repair 
Instructions for detailed graphics). 


The VANOS function test can be performed by using Special 
Tools: 



• #90 88 6 126 411 

• #90 88 6 126 050 

• Regulated Compressed Air (2-8 bar) 



Note: Refer to the Repair Instructions for the VANOS 
function test procedures.

Intake Air Plenum 

The intake air plenum is designed for maximum volume required for 
the S54 engine. The air filter housing and intake manifold are dif¬ 
ferent on the M roadster and M coupe as compared with the M3 
due to the under hood dimensions. 

The flow characteristics of the one-piece plastic shell is enhanced 
by internal “funnel” cones to direct the intake air to the throttle 
housings. 

The plenum is attached to the throttle housings by rubber sleeves. 
A Special Tool (clamp pliers) is required to secure the one-time use 
clamps. 



E46 M3 air plenum shown 


Intake Air System 



The S54 uses six individual throttle housings operated by an EDR 
actuator (1 electronic throttle control). For low engine speed (low 
load) and idling, intake air is provided by an idle air actuator (2). The 
valve regulates airflow through an external air distribution pipe to 
the individual throttle housings. Fuel tank vapor intake is regulated 
by the Evaporative Emission Valve (3). 

Note: Refer to the Repair Instructions for the procedure to 
adjust and synchronize the throttle housings. 


















Fuel Supply 



The fuel is supplied through a Non Return Fuel Rail System. This 
system is used on the S54 for LEV compliancy. 

The fuel supply pressure is controlled by the 5 Bar fuel pressure 
regulator integrated in the fuel filter assembly. The regulator is 
influenced by engine vacuum via a hose connected to the external 
air distribution pipe. The fuel exits the fuel pressure regulator sup¬ 
plying the fuel rail and the injectors. The E46 M3 fuel filter assem¬ 
bly is located under the left front floor area (next to the frame rail). 

The fuel return line is located on the filter/regulator assembly which 
directs the unused fuel back to the fuel tank. The fuel tank hydro¬ 
carbons are reduced by returning the fuel from this point instead of 
from the fuel rail. 


Clutch Assembly 

The S54 clutch assembly is specially designed to transfer the high 
torque to the driveline and dampen vibrations throughout the rpm 
range. 

The clutch assembly consists of: 

• Hydraulically Dampened Dual-Mass Flywheel 

• Diaphragm Type Pressure Plate and Drive Disk 

Exhaust System 


The US S54 uses two high performance stainless steel exhaust 
manifolds. The catalytic converters are integral with each exhaust 
manifold. 



Each exhaust manifold/catalyst contains a pre (1) and post (2) oxy¬ 
gen sensor. The sensors require a Special Tool (crescent wrench 
with swivel adapter) for removal. 


The E46 M3 exhaust system is a dual channel up to the muffler. By 
using the M-mobility kit, additional clearance is provided for the 40 
liter half-shell muffler with four outlets. The M roadster and M 
coupe have separate dual mufflers.
