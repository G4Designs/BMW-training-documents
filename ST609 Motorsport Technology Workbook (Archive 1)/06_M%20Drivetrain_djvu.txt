History 


In 1996, BMW M introduced a manual transmission that was 
capable of shifting gears automatically without the use of a con¬ 
ventional clutch pedal or mechanical shifter lever. The system 
was called the SMG I. Derived from Formula 1 racing technology; 
SMG stands for Sequential Manual Gearbox. 

The U.S. received the first SMG in the 2001 E46 M3. This sys¬ 
tem was referred to as SMG 2. The six- speed manual gearbox 
manufactured by Getrag, operated in automated “A” mode and 


performed similar to an automatic transmission or in sequential 
“S” mode, which allows the operator to shift manually through 
the gears. 

In sequential mode, the driver shifts up and down through the 
gears by simply operating the shifter lever or a pair of paddle 
shifters mounted on either side of the steering wheel. Individual 
gear selection is realized by electrical/hydraulic actuation of both, 
the gearbox selector forks and the (conventional) clutch assembly. 



E46 M3 SMG 2 Shift/Clutch Mechanism 


M Drivetrain

M Drivetrain 


Every function of the system is realized via a network of sensors 
and actuators that are monitored by the SMG 2 and Digital Motor 
Electronics modules through the use of its own SMG Controller 
Area Network (CAN) Bus. 

With the development of the E60 M5 and later the E63/E64 M6 
BMW introduced the SMG 3. This is a seven speed sequential 
gearbox with Drivelogic referred to as the SMG Getrag 247 
Gearbox. (See E60 M5 section of M Drivetrain.) 

BMW also offered a ZF version of the SMG 3 gearbox on some 
non M vehicles like the E46, E60 550i, E64 645i and E85 Z4. 


The most exciting and latest version of the sequential gearbox from 
BMW is the new M Double-Clutch Transmission with Drivelogic 
(M DCTDrivelogic). Designed by Getrag and introduced in the US 
with the launch of the E93 M3. This seven speed, double wet 
clutch transmission takes SMG to the next level. 

M DCT has five driving programs in Automatic Mode and six driv¬ 
ing programs in Sequential Mode. A new electronic gear selector 
lever and steering wheel paddle shifters move seamlessly through 
the pre-selected gears to enjoy uninterrupted drive torque. 

M DCT combines the smoothness and comfort of an automatic 
with the direct connection to the engine of the manual transmis¬ 
sion.

E60 M5 SMG 3 












E60 M5 


The SMG 3 was developed for the M5 and is designated SMG 
Getrag 247. The E60 M5 and the E63/E64 M6 use the 7-speed 
sequential M gearbox (SMG 3). 

The SMG 3 is the first sequential M gearbox that has been specif¬ 
ically developed for automated operation. Previous sequential 
gearboxes were conventional manual transmissions with an adapt¬ 
ed hydraulic gearshift unit attached. 

The central gearshift shaft has been replaced by individual selec¬ 
tor rods. The hydraulic gearshift unit is a part of the gearbox cas¬ 
ing and is no longer designed as an add-on part. 



Compared to the SMG 2 the gearshift times have been shortened 
by 20%. 

Essentially, these shorter gearshift times have been achieved by: 

• The use of individual selector rod operation. 

• The use of carbon fiber friction cones in the synchronizer 
rings that facilitate shorter synchronization times through their 
higher load bearing capacity. 

• Redesigning the transmission pinion placement (first gear 
ainion is not next to second gear pinion - they do not share 
:he same synchronizer). 

The power is transmitted from the engine to the gearbox via a 
dual-mass flywheel supplied by “LUK” and a two-disc dry clutch 
supplied by “Fichtel und Sachs”. 

The system also has the following special features: 

• Launch control 

• Hill ascent assistant 

• Drivelogic 

• Tire teach-in function, 

Initialization procedures (designed to ensure the system functions 
precisely) may be necessary after performing work on the vehicle 
that is not directly related to the gearbox.

Components 

SMG Getrag 247 Gearbox 

A special feature of this gearbox is that the main shaft is mounted 
in three bearing assemblies. The third bearing assembly has been 
realized by an end shield bolted in the gearbox casing.

Powerflow 

The diagram below illustrates the powerflow of the gearbox. 


Gearshift Pattern 

Besides the gearbox being designed solely for a sequential shifting 
mechanism, the shift pattern would make it impractical for manual 
shifting. (A manual shift version of SMG-3 is impossible.)

Gear Recognition Hall Sensors 

The engaged gear is determined in a contactless arrangement by 
means of the Hall sensors on the actuators of the individual selec¬ 
tor rods. The position of the working pistons is detected. 

Oil Temperature Sensor 

The gearbox oil temperature is determined indirectly via the 
hydraulic oil temperature sensor as both temperatures have a linear 
deviation with respect to each other. 

The SMG control unit uses this temperature value to operate the 
electric gear oil pump. 

Oil Pressure Sensor 

The hydraulic pressure sensor is located inside the hydraulic unit. 

It is used to determine operating pressure values. 

Normal operating pressure is 75 Bar (90 bar is only used during 
the learn-in/adaptation) 

Input Speed Sensor 

The gearbox input speed is determined by a Hall sensor. This sen¬ 
sor acquires the speed at the tooth flanks of the gear wheel on the 
countershaft. 

Clutch 

The E60 M5 utilizes a two disc dry clutch setup to transfer power 
from the engine to the gearbox.

Selector Lever 

The tasks of the selector lever are: 


The shift speed and therefore the shift hardness are preselected in 
sequential mode. 


• to select the ranges D-N-R 

• to change the operating modes D <-> S 

• to activate launch control 

• to activate the tow start function 


The shift points can be influenced by the setting in Drive mode. 

Steering Angle Sensor 

The signal is tapped off from the CAN. This value influences the 
automatic function of the gearbox (gearshift suppression). 


Eight Hall sensors determine the selector lever positions which are 
sent individually to the transmission control. 

All selector lever positions are based on a redundant design where 
a sensor switches to ground and the corresponding redundant 
sensor switches in positive direction to ensure reliable detection 
even in the case of failure. 

Gearshift Lever 


Gearshift Paddles 

The gearshift paddles can be used to perform the following func¬ 
tions: 

• upshift and downshift (+/-) 

• change of operating mode from "D" to "S" 

• Manual initiation of wheel circumference teach-in function (the 
hill ascent assistant no longer needs to be activated manually). 



Drivelogic Switch 

The Drivelogic selector switch can be used to choose between six 
gearshift programs in sequential mode and five shift programs in 
Drive mode.

Longitudinal Acceleration/Gradient Sensor 

The longitudinal acceleration and gradient values are determined 
by the longitudinal acceleration sensor in the rightfootwell. This 
signal is used for the purpose of calculating the gradient. 

For redundancy, the SMG control unit receives the signal from 
the brake light switch and the brake light test switch. 

The signal from the brake light switch is used for: 

• Shift lock function 

• Brake detection 

• Engine start 

• Disengaging gear 

• DSC activation 

The signal is made available via the CAN. 

Wake-Up 

The SGM control unit assumes standby mode as soon as the vehi¬ 
cle is unlocked. As a result, the hydraulic unit generates sufficient 
pressure to disengage the clutch if necessary. 

Hood Contact Sensors 

Two Hall sensors mounted on the hood latches determine the 
hood status. 

Similar to the E46 M3 eguipped with an SMG gearbox, the driver is 
warned if the hood is open. The vehicle can only start off if the 
hood contact status are both closed. If the status cannot be deter¬ 
mined, the vehicle will not engage into gear. 


Door Contact 

Information on the door status is sent via the CAN to the SMG con¬ 
trol unit. The gear is automatically disengaged when the door is 
opened. 

This signal should not be confused with the wake-up signal. 

Engine Speed 

For redundancy reasons, this signal is made available via the CAN- 
bus as well as a hardwire signal. It is used to control the clutch and 
to establish whether the engine is running. 

Within the safety concept, the engine speed signal is used to mon¬ 
itor the current status. 

Reverse Light 

The redundant sensor system of the 1/R selector rod detects 
reverse gear when engaged and correspondingly informs the trans¬ 
mission control. The transmission control informs the lights switch¬ 
ing center that reverse gear is engaged. 




Hydraulic System 

A DC motor drives the hydrostatic pump. The pump conveys the 
hydraulic oil via a nonreturn valve into a pressure system while 
energy is stored in a hydraulic accumulator. 

The operating pressure is 75 bar. The maximum pressure is 90 bar 
which is applied only during initialization procedures. 

The maximum shift force is approx. 2,500 N. 

Inside the hydraulic unit are the following components: 

• Pressure Accumulator 

• Hydraulic Pressure Sensor 

• Solenoid Valve for the Clutch 

• Pressure Limiter Valve 

• Regulator Block 

• Clutch Slave Cylinder with PLCD Sensor 

• Expansion Tank 

• Hydraulic Pump with Electric Motor 

• Check Valve 

• Hydraulic Temperature Sensor 

• Filter

Pressure Accumulator 

The pressure accumulator is fitted on the bottom left of the trans¬ 
mission. The pressure accumulator supplies enough hydraulic 
power for the gearshift. 

Hydraulic Pressure Sensor 

The hydraulic pressure sensor is fitted directly to the hydraulic 
block of the hydraulic control unit. The hydraulic pressure sensor 
reports the current hydraulic pressure to the SMG control unit. The 
hydraulic pump is switched on and off accordingly. 

Solenoid Valve for the Clutch 

The solenoid valve for the clutch is used for actuating the clutch 
slave cylinder. 

Hydraulic Pump with Electric Motor 

The hydraulic pump with electric motor builds up to 90 bar system 
pressure for the gearshift. The hydraulic pump with electric motor 
is actuated via the SMG control unit. 

Hydraulic Temperature Sensor 

The hydraulic temperature sensor measures the temperature of the 
hydraulic fluid at the hydraulic pump. 

The signal is used for actuation of the transmission functions in the 
SMG control unit. The signal is transmitted by a direct wire from 
the hydraulic temperature sensor to the SMG control unit. 


Pressure Limiter Valve 

The pressure limiter valve prevent the oil pressure in the hydraulic 
control unit from becoming too high. 

Regulator Block 

The regulator block is installed in the center of the transmission 
housing close to the clutch housing. 

The regulator block consists of the following components: 

• 4 shift travel valves for actuating the hydraulic shift cylinders 

• 2 pressure control valves for modulation of the shift force 

• 4 hydraulic shift cylinders for moving the shift rods in the longi¬ 
tudinal axis 

• 4 transmission position sensors for recording the selected 
gear (shift rod sensor R/1 is designed as a double version.) 



Clutch Slave Cylinder 

The clutch slave cylinder consists of two pistons and a spring 
between the two piston elements. 

The second piston is moved hydraulically. The second piston 
makes it possible to bleed the clutch slave cylinder in installed 
position without having to open any screws. 

A PLCD sensor (Permanent-magnetic Linear Contactless 
Displacement) is arranged separately in the housing of the clutch 
slave cylinder. This sensor determines the exact position of the 
release piston.

PLCD Sensor 


PLCD Sensor 

The PLCD sensor essentially consists of a special core made of 
soft magnetic material. 

The entire length of the core is enclosed by a coil (primary coil) 
with a further, short evaluator coil at each end. 

A permanent magnet approaching the sensor causes local mag¬ 
netic saturation and therefore virtual division of the core. 

A voltage, depending on the position of the saturated area, is 
induced in the evaluator coils when an appropriate alternating cur¬ 
rent is applied to the primary coil. Conseguently, the length of the 
virtual parts of the core and therefore the position of the saturated 
area can be determined in this way. 

The SMG control unit powers the sensor and correspondingly 
processes, evaluates and converts the signals. 

The alternating voltage necessary for the measurement is supplied 
by the ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) integrated in 
the PLCD sensors. 

Expansion Tank 

The expansion tank ensures that there is always sufficient hydraulic 
fluid available for the system. 

Check Valve 

The check valve at the outlet to the hydraulic pump prevents the 
hydraulic pressure from reducing when the hydraulic pump is inac¬ 
tive. 

Filter 

A filter is installed at the inlet end of the hydraulic pump. The filter 
prevents impurities from entering the solenoid valve (functional fail¬ 
ure). It is not necessary to clean the filter.

Drivelogic 

Each time you change between the Sequential Mode and the Drive 
Mode, the driving program last selected in the respective mode is 
active. The exception to this, is after the first change from the 
Sequential to the Drive Mode. In this case, driving program 3 
is active. 


In Drive Mode 

Five driving programs, from relaxed 1 to sporty/highly dynamic 
5 are available for selection. 

In Sequential Mode 

You can choose from six driving program from balanced/dynamic 
1 to sporty/purist 6. 

Each time the engine is started, driving program 3 is activated. 

The sporty/purist driving program 6 is only available with the DSC 
Dynamic Stability Control deactivated. When DSC is activated, 
the system switches from driving program 6 to 5. 

Note: To maintain vehicle stability, always drive with the 
DSC switched on when possible. 



Transmission program selection button is located next to the shifter. 




























Special Functions 


Tow-Start 

The following procedure must be implemented to activate this 
function: 

• With the brake pedal depressed, turn the ignition key to 
terminal 15, 

• select position "N", 

• tow-start/push-start the vehicle, 

• shift selector lever to "S+" and hold in this position. 

The transmission control engages the gear corresponding to 
the speed and activates the clutch. 

Hill Ascent Assistant 

Compared to the SMG 2, the hill ascent assistant function has now 
been automated. 

This means the hill ascent assistant no longer needs to be selected 
manually with the minus shift paddle on the steering wheel and the 
brake depressed as was the case with the SMG 2. It is now acti¬ 
vated automatically when the transmission system recognizes any 
position other than "N". 

The hill ascent assistant in the SMG 3 is now an active system that 
makes use of the DSC to control the vehicle via the wheel brakes 
on uphill/downhill gradients (clutch load reduction). 

Note: Further information on the hill ascent assistant can 
be found in the Chassis and Suspension Section 
under "DSC". 



Hill Hold Feature (similar to regular production E60 - shown) 

Launch Control 

Launch control has been carried over from the E46 M3. 

Clutch Overload Protection (KUS) 

The clutch overload protection function (KUS) protects the clutch 
from thermal overload. 

The clutch overload protection function makes use of an arithmetic 
logic in the SMG control unit that can calculate the thermal load of 
the clutch based on the slip and contact force. 

In the first stage, the clutch overload protection function reduces 
the slip at the clutch. The customer would refer to this as a "harsh 
gearshift". 

The anti-jolt function is activated as a further protection measure. 
As a result, the thermal input at the clutch discs is reduced and the 
driver's attention is drawn to the overload situation. 

If the temperature continues to increase, a warning is triggered in 
order to repeatedly draw the driver's attention to the overload situa¬ 
tion. Start-off in 2nd gear is automatically inhibited when the gear¬ 
box warning is triggered in order to minimize the clutch slip.

Service Information 

Initialization 

As on the SMG 2, the SMG control unit must newly adapt and 
store various parameters after a component has been replaced in 
the area of the clutch or gearbox as well as after programming. 

Clutch Teach-In Function 

This function is used to adapt the clutch to the characteristics 
stored in the control unit. The clutch grab point is taught-in with 
the engine running. 

The clutch is released, and after the input shaft has stopped, initial¬ 
ly, the clutch moves quickly close to the grab point and then slowly 
approaches the grab point. 

This procedure is terminated if a transmission input speed is 
already measured during the fast approach phase as there is 
obviously a fault in the system (e.g. bleeding). 

If a valid value is measured during the slow approach of the clutch 
towards the grab point this value is stored in the SMG control unit. 

Teaching in the Axle Difference 

The teach-in function for the axle difference must be initiated man¬ 
ually after a change in the dynamic rolling circumference (tire 
change, snow chains, etc.) of one or several wheels on the vehicle 
to ensure correct operation of the transmission control system. 

These differences are also adapted automatically but with a con¬ 
siderable time delay. This function is initiated manually as follows: 

• Vehicle speed between 30 and 150 km/h 

• Transmission in position "N" 

• Brakes not applied 

• Pull both shift paddles on steering wheel for 2 seconds 


Pressure Accumulator Preload 

A function for checking the accumulator preload is available for 
service applications. 

The diagnostic procedure evaluates the time required to discharge 
the accumulator. The pressure sensor of the hydraulic unit is used 
to measure the pressure. 

The SMG control unit still measures the time required for filling. If a 
shorter period of time is required to reach the cutoff pressure this 
indicates that the nitrogen, which the accumulator must contain as 
the preload medium, has leaked out of the accumulator. 

The shut-off valve on the pressure accumulator is monitored sepa¬ 
rately. 

Adaptations 

It is necessary to check the gearbox mechanism after replacing a 
gearbox, components of a gearbox or the SMG control unit. The 
following adaptations are provided in the ISTA/GT1 diagnostic 
equipment. 

The most important adaptations in the gearbox are: 

• Shift range mid-points 

• Valve characteristics 

• Transmission characteristics 

• Longitudinal acceleration sensor offset 

Shift Range Mid-Points 

This function ensures a gear can be disengaged without previous 
adaptation of the transmission characteristics. 




Valve Characteristics 

The shift range valves in the hydraulic system are designed as pro¬ 
portional valves. Due to the tolerance scatter in series production, 
it is necessary to teach in the offset current of these valves. 

The current at which the corresponding selector rod begins to 
move is determined. This value is stored as the offset current in 
the SMG control unit. 

The current consumption of the proportional valves is determined 
in both switching directions. 

Transmission Characteristics 

In this adaptation phase, the selector rods are moved to the end 
positions and the actual values determined. 

The measured values indicate whether a gear is engaged. 

The selector rod for reverse gear is additionally monitored by a 
redundant sensor whose values are also stored. 

In addition, the hydraulic pressure is read off at this selector rod 
and the selector rod is monitored to ensure it remains in the end 
position. 

Longitudinal Acceleration Sensor 

The measured value of the longitudinal acceleration sensor has a 
constant offset. This value is determined when the vehicle is at rest 
in horizontal position and therefore the longitudinal acceleration is 
zero. 

The actual values are permanently sampled. As soon as a sample 
value deviates by more than a reference value, external influences 
are assumed and the adaptation procedure is terminated to ensure 
no falsified acceleration values are measured during vehicle opera¬ 
tion.

M DCTTransmission 


BMW has introduced the new generation of sequential transmis¬ 
sions. The M Double-Clutch Transmission with Drivelogic 
(M DKG) GS7D36SG is available as an option on the entire 
E9x M3 series and is referred to as M DCT Drivelogic. 

The M double-clutch transmission combines the benefits of a 
sequential M transmission with that of an automatic. Like the 
SMG, it can be used in automatic mode "Drive" and in manual 
mode "Sequential". 

There are 5 Drivelogic programs in automatic “Drive” mode and 
6 Drivelogic programs in “Sequential” mode. In sequential mode 
shifting can either be done with the new electronic sports shift 
lever, exclusive to the BMW M3, or with paddle shifters on the 
steering wheel. The main characteristic of this system is that 


there is no longer an interruption in driving force during the shift¬ 
ing operation from gear to gear. 

Shifting is controlled by the M DCT electronics and executed by 
the M DCT hydraulic components. These are combined into one 
mechatronics module and integrated into the transmission. The 
M DCT has a dedicated system to directly lubricate all of the rele¬ 
vant transmission components. The transmission oil temperature 
is regulated by a special two stage cooling system. 

An electric automatic parking lock has been integrated into the 
system. Selection of the driving programs and gears are con¬ 
trolled using the (M GWS) electric gear selector switch. Different 
driving modes and settings can be selected through the controller 
and the fifth settings menu of the CID (option dependent).

Principle of Operation 

The M DCT consists of two sub-transmissions, each with its own 
clutch. Clutch 1 with sub-transmission 1 and clutch 2 with sub¬ 
transmission 2. Sub-transmission 1 consists of the gears 1, 3, 5, 7 
and Reverse while sub-transmission 2 consists of gears 2, 4 and 6. 
This means that the your next gear is always pre-selected in the 
other sub-transmission, regardless of whether you are shifting up 
or down (with the exception of "R"). 

For example, while still in the acceleration phase of the currently 
selected gear, if on sub-transmission 1 the next logical gear on 


sub-transmission 2 is engaged in advance, in a process similar to 
the Shift Overlap function of an automatic transmission. 

Precise control of the clutches when upshifting will allow the driv¬ 
ing force to be transferred very quickly and smoothly from sub¬ 
transmission 1 to sub-transmission 2 without an interruption in 
driving power. This results in significant benefits not only for the 
available driving force but also in terms of shift comfort. 

By combining the seamless driving force and comfort of the auto¬ 
matic with the direct connection to the engine as a manual, M DCT 
provides the benefits of both transmissions.

Operation and Power Flow 

Operation 

The driving force is guided into the transmission by a central input 
shaft (1) through wet clutches 1 and 2, which are integrated into 
the transmission. 

Clutch 1 (2) transmits the power to inner input shaft 1 (5). 

Clutch 2 (3) transmits the power to inner input shaft 2 (4). 

The torque is then transferred to the output shaft (8) via the 
countershaft (6). 


The constant gears (7) are always engaged regardless of the gear 
selected. The countershaft and the output shaft are also always 
engaged. 

The respective gear pairs are selected via the sliding clutches (9). 

The 7th gear is the direct gear, the sliding clutch connects inner 
input shaft 1 directly to the output shaft. 

The parking lock (10) is located directly on the output shaft.

The greater portion of the driving force is still being transferred by 
clutch 1. The pressure on clutch 1 is still significantly higher than 
the increasing pressure on clutch 2. 


Shifting Operation From 1st to 2nd Gear 

The following is a diagram demonstrating the shifting operation 
from 1st to 2nd gear with regulated transmission of the driving 
force between clutch 1 and clutch 2. 


2nd gear is already pre-selected, while the driver accelerates in first 
gear (not shown). During the first phase, clutch 2 begins to engage 
as clutch 1 begins to disengage.

During the second phase, the driving force is distributed propor¬ 
tionally to clutch 2, which is engaging and clutch 1 which is disen¬ 
gaging. In this diagram both clutches have nearly the same pres¬ 
sure. 


During the 3rd phase, clutch 2 carries the greater portion of the 
driving force, while clutch 1 disengages further. The pressure on 
clutch 2 is now significantly higher than the decreasing pressure on 
clutch 1.

Automatic Parking Lock 

This is the first time that an inte¬ 
grated automatic parking lock has 
been used in an M vehicle. 

When the engine is turned off, 
there is no mechanical connection 
between engine and drive wheels 
(clutches are at zero pressure and 
disengaged).

There is no parking lock button on 
the selector lever of the M GWS. 

The parking lock position is deter¬ 
mined by the M DCT electronics. 

The parking lock is engaged with 
the use of a parking lock electro¬ 
magnet. This electromagnet is built into the gear selector switch 
housing and is activated directly by the M DCT electronics. It 
transfers its movement (stroke) to a Bowden cable. The parking 
lock Bowden cable transfers the movement directly to the external 
parking lock lever on the transmission and then to the inner parking 
lock lever.

The parking lock disengages hydraulically in the transmission. To 
engage the parking lock using the electromagnet, the parking lock 
hydraulic components must be at zero pressure. 

The parking lock will always be automatically engaged once the 
engine has been turned off, except in "N". 

When in "N", the parking lock is engaged: 

• when vehicle remote control is not in the ignition lock 
(Comfort Access) 

• when removing the remote control from the ignition lock 

• 30 minutes after the engine has been turned off. 

Note: At the carwash, before stopping the engine you must 
deliberately shift to "N" and leave the transmitter in 
the ignition lock. (With Comfort Access it must 
remain in the car or be inserted in the ignition lock). 


Emergency Release of Parking Lock 

In an emergency, the parking lock can be released by operating 
the emergency release mechanism. This is achieved releasing 
the mechanical connection between the GWS and M DCT. 
(See “Service Information”) 


CAUTION!!! 


If the parking lock is released the 
vehicle may roll. 


Mechatronics Module 

The mechatronics module integrated into the M DCT transmission 
housing consists of the M DCT electronics and the M DCT 
hydraulic components. 

The selector rod position sensors are mounted directly on the M 
DCT electronics. The speed sensors for inner input shafts 1 and 2 
are integrated in the upper position sensors. 

The parking lock sensors are integrated in the second position 
sensor from the bottom.

Owner's Manual for the vehicle and in the Repair 
Instructions.

The eight individual gears are engaged by four hydraulic cylinders 
and four individual selector rods. The selector rod positions are 
detected without the need for direct contact with the use of the 
selector rod position sensors. 



View of selector rod side of M DCT mechatronics module 



Torque Intervention 

The M DCT mechatronics module sends a torque requirement to 
the engine control module on the PT-CAN in order to achieve a 
torque intervention when shifting gear under load or when coast¬ 
ing. This is negative when upshifting so that the engine speed is 
reduced. When downshifting the torque intervention is positive, in 
order to increase the engine speed. Gear shifting is supported by 
the engine control module through this torque intervention strategy. 

LIN-bus Module 

There is a LIN-bus connection in the M DCT electronics for redun¬ 
dant communication with the gear selector switch (GWS). 

M DCT Transmission Sensors 

The following sensors are mounted in the transmission and their 
signals are sent directly to the M DCT electronics: 

• Input shaft 1 speed (Hall) sensor monitors rotation and 
direction of transmission shaft 1. 

• Input shaft 2 speed (Hall) sensor without rotation direction 
detection for the transmission shaft 2. 

• Clutch oil pressure (Piezo) sensors for clutch 1 and 2. 

• 3 temperature sensors (NTC), one for the ejected clutch oil 
and two redundant temperature sensors for the M DCT elec¬ 
tronics. 

• 4 linear (Hall) sensors monitor the selector rod position. 

• 1 double (redundant) parking lock (Hall) sensor. 

The oil sump temperature is measured using a complex tempera¬ 
ture map and checked against the temperature of the clutch oil by 
the M DCT electronics.

M-Gear Selector Switch (M GWS) 

The double clutch transmission in the E9x M3 has an M specific 
gear selector switch. It is operated in a similar way to the one in 
the E6x M5/M6 with the sequential transmission (SMG).

The M GWS consists of the selector lever with indicator, the hous¬ 
ing with control module and the external but electrically connected 
Drivelogic program selector button. 


Selector Lever Indicator and Function 

The shift pattern, driving program, gear selection indicator on the 
selector lever are all similar to that of the E6x M5/M6 with SMG. 
The main difference is that the selector lever on the gear selector 
switch in the E9x M3 no longer snaps into the "N" and "R" posi¬ 
tions, instead it only snaps into "R". 

The M GWS selector lever is self centering as it returns back to its 
normal starting position on its own, after the driver selects the 
desired gear. Reverse gear is an exception; because once the 
shifter lever is moved left and into the "R" position the gear must 
be manually unselected by the driver. 

The shift pattern, driving program, gear selection indicator on the 
selector lever are all displayed in red, depending on the position of 
the selector lever and driving program selected. 

The indicator displays the currently selected driving program and 
the gear selection options. The indicator consists of the locating 
light that indicates the shift pattern and the function indicator lamp. 
These are two different red position LEDs that show the currently 
selected driving program and the gear selection options. 

The function indicator lamp in the M GWS is controlled by the M 
DCT electronics. The function indicator lamp is monitored, read 
back and compared with the required indicator for plausibility. 

In addition to the PT-CAN connection; there is a LIN-bus connec¬ 
tion built in to the M GWS for redundant communication with the 
M DCT electronics. 

Note: For further information regarding the M-Gear 

Selector Switch refer to the M DCT training material 
available in TIS and ICP or the vehicle’s owners man¬ 
ual. 











Selector Lever in the Start Position 


Except for when in the position "R", the selector lever always 
returns to the start position. When starting the engine the parking 
lock is always engaged and the clutches are both disengaged (zero 
oil pressure). The engine can be turned on regardless of the gear it 
was in when it was turned off. 


The selector lever indicator is 
displayed in red when in the start 
position. Driving program "D" 
Drive (automatic gear mode) is 
selected by briefly pushing the 
selector lever to the right, caus¬ 
ing the M DCT, when in auto¬ 
matic gear mode, to change 
gears automatically into first 
(second) gear. The selector 
lever indicator "D/S" option is 
also displayed in red to indicate 
the start position. 



M GWS selector lever during and 
after starting the engine 


The M GWS one-touch function 
is pushed to the right once to 
start automatic gear mode 



Driving Program "S" (Sequential Mode) 

By pressing the selector briefly to the right a second time the M 
DCT changes from automatic to sequential mode "S". 

If, while driving in 2nd to 6th gear, the driving program "S" is select¬ 
ed, then in addition to the "D/S", the "+" and will light up in red. 

The driver can now change to the next higher gear by briefly 
moving the selector lever backwards a notch or downshift by 
moving it briefly forward a notch. 

A desired gear shift may only be executed within the range of 
permissible engine speeds. There is no automatic up-shifting 
once the maximum speed has been reached. 

In automatic “Drive” mode, as soon as the selector lever is moved 
towards the front, the back or a shift paddle on the steering wheel 
is activated, the M DCT switches to sequential mode.

twice to start sequential mode

In sequential mode there are two additional indicators, one for 1 st 
gear and one for 7th gear. 


Downshifting 

In 1 st gear the is no longer lit 
up in red, because it is no longer 
possible to downshift. 



M GWS in sequential mode

Gear Selection "N" Neutral 

The driver can consciously shift 
into neutral by pressing the 
selector lever briefly to the left. 

"N" will light up in red in the 
selector lever indicator. This is 
useful for example in a carwash. 


Note: At the car wash, before stopping the engine you 

must deliberately shift to "N" and leave the transmit¬ 
ter in the ignition lock. (With Comfort Access it must 
remain in the car or be inserted in the ignition lock). 



Upshifting

If the engine is turned on while 
the selector lever position is in 
"R", the start position of the 
selector lever will flash red at one 
second intervals. This signals 
the driver that the Reverse gear 
is selected and that he must first 
return the shift lever to the (self 
centering) start position, in order 
to select a new gear or driving 
program. 



Gear Selection "R" Reverse Gear 

When in this shift position, reverse gear is selected and the "R" will 
light up in red. 










M GWS Shifter Sensor System 

The selector lever position is detected with the use of Hall sensors. 
These are available mostly in groups of 2 or 4. In total there are 14 
Hall sensors. This ensures maximum fault handling and diagnostic 
capacity. 


The M GWS wake up is done by a high signal on the PT-CAN 
wake-up line. 

The M GWS itself has no active wake-up capabilities. The indica¬ 
tor on the selector Lever is active as soon as bus communication is 
active on the PT-CAN or the LIN-bus.

Interface to the M DCT 

The selector lever position is transmitted through the PT-CAN and 
a LIN-bus. In the event of a failure of one of the two communica¬ 
tion lines, a signal is still sent to the M DCT.

Drivelogic Program Selection 

The controls and indicators in the vehicle are similar to the SMG 2 
and SMG 3 vehicles. 

The Drivelogic program switch gives you the option of choosing 
between six driving programs in sequential mode and five driving 
programs in drive mode. 

The selected driving program is displayed as a barchart in the 
instrument cluster. 

In sequential mode the switching speed is affected which has a 
direct effect on the shifting firmness. 

The sixth shift program can only be selected when the DSC 
function is de-activated. 

In drive mode the shift points and the shifting speed are affected, 
as a higher shift program means a higher gear changeover speed 
and thus a higher shifting speed. 

In addition to the Drivelogic program selection, the shift time is also 
dependent on the position of the accelerator pedal and how quickly 
it is operated.

Lubrication System 


Pressure and Flow Regulation 

A gear driven pump is integrated into the M DCT transmission and 
is responsible for circulating the oil through the unit. 

The transmission oil pump is driven by a gear on the drive input 
side which connects to the center input shaft of the M DCT. 

The engine must be running for the oil pressure to build up.

Oil intake side (oil supply) 


Note: Because transmission oil pressure cannot be built 
up when the engine is not running, a M DCT vehicle 
should never be push-started. 

The operating pressure is determined by a regulated control valve 
depending on the load and the function selected. The system is 
protected by a pressure relief valve in the pump. 

The pressure is regulated according to the following priorities: 

• Clutch engagement and disengagement 

• Gearchanges 

• Cooling the clutch 

• Lubrication cycle 

The transmission oil pressure should be high enough to: 

• Be able to engage the clutches reliably. 

• Allow the gear selector rod to reach the reguired 
control shift speed. 

The normal operating pressure range is between 5 and 20 bar, 
although it can be increased up to 30 bar if necessary to maintain 
proper transmission operation. 

At maximum shifting force, the pressure reguired to operate the 
selector rods can be the same as the operating pressure. 

The pressure reguired for the clutches is limited to 18 bar. The 
clutch is regulated by an integrated proportioning valve. 

Overpressure protection is ensured by a pressure relief valve. 

Clutch cooling is map-controlled using a proportional valve. 

Note: The M DCT Drivelogic transmission has a new long¬ 
term rated oil, DCT Oil-1, which requires no replace¬ 
ment unless specified for a repair. 




















Oil-spray Lubrication 

The M DCT transmission applies direct lubrication with the use of 
an internal lubricating pipe fitted with individual nozzles and aimed 
at pre-determined areas of the gear train.

Hydraulic Emergency Operation 

If there is a fault, the M DCT has a hydraulic emergency operation 
mode. For example, if the power supply fails, the active gear 
remains selected and the active clutch engaged. This makes it 
possible to drive to the next possible vehicle storage location or 
parking area. The clutch disengages only when the engine speed 
goes below the minimum rpm and then it remains disengaged.

Two-stage Transmission Oil Cooling 

Oil to Coolant Cooling 

The M DCT transmission oil cooling circuit consists of an oil to 
coolant heat exchanger, an oil to air heat exchanger, a transmission 
oil thermostat and the relevant cooler lines. The oil to coolant heat 
exchanger is part of the engine cooling system of the vehicle. 
Mounted on the transmission housing it allows the oil to flow 
directly from the M DCT into the oil to coolant heat exchanger. 

Engine coolant directly from the cylinder head is pumped to the oil 
to coolant heat exchanger by the auxiliary coolant pump and then 


circulated back to the engine cooling system. The M DCT elec¬ 
tronics can switch on the auxiliary coolant pump as needed. The 
auxiliary coolant pump, which is normally used to enhance the effi¬ 
ciency of the heating system, is used here to warm up the M DCT 
transmission. This design shortens the warm up time and main¬ 
tains the transmission oil in the desired operating temperature 
range. 

After the oil to coolant heat exchanger has brought the temperature 
of the transmission oil to above 95°C/203°F, an oil thermostat 
directs the transmission oil to the oil to air heat exchanger located 
at the front of the vehicle.

Oil to Air Cooling 

An oil thermostat is used to direct the oil flow through the oil to air 
heat exchanger. There is a by-pass passage in bore of the oil ther¬ 
mostat which is located between the supply and the return flow 
from the oil to air heat exchanger. 

■ Oil “Warm-up” 

When the oil temperature is below 95°C (203°F), the oil by-pass 
passage is opened by the thermal control valve in the oil thermo¬ 
stat. Oil flows out of the oil to coolant heat exchanger directly 
through the oil thermostat and back into the M DOT. This by-pass- 
es the oil to air heat exchanger completely and allows the system to 
reach operating temperature. 



The M DCT oil thermostat closes at an oil 
temperature below 95 °C 


■ Oil “Cooling” 

When the oil temperature is above 95°C (203°F), the oil by-pass 
passage is closed by the thermal control valve in the oil thermostat. 
The hot oil is now directed to the oil to air heat exchanger for cool¬ 
ing before it flows back into the M DCT. 

This design enhances the overall thermal efficiency of the oil to air 
heat exchanger while maintaining the proper transmission oil oper¬ 
ating temperature. 



The M DCT oil thermostat opens at an oil 
temperature above 95 °C 


Note: In the event that the transmission oil temperature 
increases above the allowable limit, the engine 
torque is reduced and the maximum rpm is limited 
as a safety measure. 











Service Information 

Parking Lock 

The parking lock Bowden cable does not need to be adjusted. 

Parking Lock Emergency Release 


The emergency release is described in detail in the vehicle’s 
Owner's Manual and in the Repair Instructions. 

Note: Releasing the parking lock using the emergency 
release can cause a fault code entry in the M DCT 
electronics. 


To manually release the electrical parking lock: 

• Removed the shifter boot is to gain access to the release 
mechanism. 


• Using the screw driver from the vehicle tool kit or (similar tool), 
unclip the release mechanism cover. 

• Insert the screw driver/tool in the release mechanism to the 
left of the shifter. 


• Move the release toward the rear of the vehicle and observe 
the shifter indicator light illuminate the “N” position. 



CAUTION!!! 


The vehicle will roll with the emer¬ 
gency parking lock released. 


CarWash 

At the carwash, before stopping the engine, you must actively 
switch to "N". Vehicles with “Comfort Access” must leave the 
transmitter in the vehicle or in the ignition lock. 

Transmission Oil 

■ M DCT Oil Type 

"BMW DCT Oil-1" is a long-term oil that was especially designed 
for the M DCT transmission. 

■ Oil Change Interval 

The M DCT Drivelogic transmission has a new long-term rated oil, 
DCT Oil-1, which requires no replacement unless specified for a 
repair. (See SI B 00 01 07) 

Transmission Oil Cooling 

In the event that the transmission oil temperature increases above 
the allowable limit, the engine torque is reduced and the maximum 
rpm is limited as a safety measure. 


CAUTION!!! 


Because system oil pressure cannot 
be built up when the engine is not 
running, push starting a M DCT 
vehicle is not recommended.

Variable M Differential 


The variable M differential from the E46 M3 is utilized in the E60 
M5 as well in the E9x M3. The variable, rev-sensing locking 
differential on the rear axle delivers a key traction advantage, 
even in very demanding driving situations. 

For example: When the friction coefficients (surface trac¬ 
tion) for the two drive wheels are very differ¬ 
ent from each other. 

By utilizing the internal sheer pump, the locking effect between 
the left and right wheels can be up to 100%. This markedly 
improves handling and stability, enhancing both safety and driving 
enjoyment. 

Sporty drivers in particular enjoy the advantages of the differential 
lock which enhances the positive aspects of rear-wheel drive 
when driving at higher speeds and on surfaces with poor traction. 

E46 Rear Axle Differential 

The rear axle differential was developed specifically for the E46 
M3. The rear axle differential is designated “210” (ring gear diam¬ 
eter in mm). 

The mounting points of the rear axle carrier for the differential 
have been modified compared to the E46/2. 

The rear axle differential is bolted to the rear axle carrier at two 
mounting points on the rear axle differential casing. 

The rear axle carrier is connected to the body at the same points 
as the E46/2. For all BMW vehicles, this mounting arrangement is 
known as double-flexible rear axle mounting. 


The cover of the rear axle differential is made of pressure die cast 
aluminum. Special arranged cooling fins reduce the temperature 
of the oil in the differential. 

The technical innovations of the variable M-differential lock devel¬ 
oped by BMW M in cooperation with GKN Viscodrive GmbH. 



E46 M3 Differential 





Variable M-differential Lock 

To date, torque-sensing limited slip differentials with a constant 
basic locking torque have been used in M vehicles. The differential 
lock value for current M vehicles is 25%. However, if traction is very 
low, e.g. on snow, the advantages with this differential lock concept 
are limited due to the restricted support torque. 

A variable differential lock was used for the first time in the E46 M3. 
Compared to the conventional torque-sensing differential lock, the 
variable M-differential lock is capable of providing traction 
advantages even under extreme conditions. 

When there is a speed difference between both wheels, a shear 
pump located on the ring gear side generates a pressure. A work¬ 
ing piston transmits this controlled pressure on the basis of the 
differential speed of the drive wheels to the multi-disc clutches so 
that the drive torque is transmitted to the wheel with the most 
“grip”. 


The pump pressure and locking power increase as the speed 
difference between the two wheels increase. If the differential 
speed between both wheels decreases, the pump pressure is also 
reduced and the locking power diminishes. 

The Pump Unit 

The pump unit is sealed (cannot be dismantled) and is filled with 
high viscosity silicone oil. 

As a result of the speed difference between the drive wheels, shear 
forces occur in the silicone oil in the pump unit between a channel 
filled with silicone oil and a pump disc located above it. 

These shear forces generate a pressure that is dependent on the 
differential speed of the drive pinions. 

The pressure is built up by a piston (max. 38 bar on E46 M3) that 
presses the multi-disc clutches together achieving a variable 
differential lock effect dependent on the differential speed.

Principle of Operation 

The conveyor belt model illustrates the functional principle of the 
shear pump. As the conveyor belt moves, the viscous friction in 
the laterally sealed shear channel conveys the fluid in the direction 
of movement. 



By transferring the operation principle to a rotary system, the con¬ 
veyor belt becomes a displacement disc driven by the Hub. The 
shear channel is then a circular groove in the control disk. The con¬ 
trol disk is located in the pump housing. 

Transfer ports that are connected to outlet holes in the pump hous¬ 
ing are provided at the ends of the shear channel. 


Silicone oil is conveyed through the outlet holes from the equaliza¬ 
tion chamber (fluid reservoir) into the pressure chamber. Piston 
exerts a pressure on the friction discs. 

The arrows shown below represent the flow of silicone oil between 
the displacement disc and the control disc. The silicone oil is trans¬ 
ferred from the reservoir on the outside of the pump housing to the 
pressure chamber between displacement discs and the piston. 

The arrangement of the pump elements and specific routing of the 
silicone oil in a gap between the piston and displacement disc 
ensures the pressure generated acts on the piston.
