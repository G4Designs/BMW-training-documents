Introduction 


Forthe first time in the US market, BMW is introducing the avail¬ 
ability of Real Time Traffic Information (RTTI). RTTI offers real time 
information on traffic conditions as well as dynamic rerouting if a 
destination is entered in the navigation system. 

This feature will be introduced on vehicles equipped with a CCC 
based navigation system in the following 2007 model vehicles: 
E70 X5, E60/61/63/64, and E9x models. 

Unlike other automobile manufacturers that charge a recurring 
monthly fee for RTTI, or require customers to pay for an additional 
satellite radio service, BMW has included RTTI as part of the cost 
of the navigation system. There are no activation fees or recurring 
monthly charges to BMW customers for 4 years. 

BMW's new RTTI service will be available in as many as 44 major 
metropolitan markets through Clear Channel's Total Traffic 
Network, Clear Channel Radio's award-winning programming and 
technology service. It delivers Real Time Traffic Information direct¬ 
ly to vehicles over its extensive network of FM radio stations. 

With the help of Clear Channel's broadcast network, customers 
no longer have to search for traffic reports on radio stations to be 
in-the-know about traffic situations. 



Up-to-date traffic information is compiled from a variety of sources 
including FM radio stations, highway-embedded sensors, video 
monitors on bridges and roadways, and local traffic monitoring 
centers. 

Traffic data is then streamed to a dedicated tuner in the car's radio 
and transferred directly to the navigation system. 

Customers can receive traffic updates from a variety of stations, 

24 hours a day, seven days a week. The radio does not have to be 
turned on nor does it interfere when the customer is listening to 
other entertainment sources such as a C D or iPod. 

If a destination is entered in the navigation system, the best route 
is calculated with consideration to the traffic incidents and poten¬ 
tial delays. 

In addition to alerting the driverto where the traffic is, if the delay 
is calculated to be more than 5 minutes then the navigation sys¬ 
tem will offer alternative routes around the congestion, either 
automatically or at the choice of the driver. 

The following highlights of the Real Time Traffic Information 
service provide benefits to the customer and help BMW drivers 
avoid traffic delays: 

• Navigation system provides dynamic alternate routes auto¬ 
matically while in route guidance mode. 

• Navigation system provides last exit warnings with detour 
option if delay is more than 5 minutes. 

• Traffic incidents are displayed as icons on the map display, 
or in a list format sorted by distance from current location. 

• Traffic incidents on a planned route are highlighted by a 
yellow diamond. 

• There is no activation fee or monthly subscription fee 

• Satellite Radio option is not required

Components 


The RTTI system has been fully integrated by utilizing control 
modules already present in a vehicle equipped with a CCC based 
navigation system. 

The systems and components interfaced with are: 

• CarCommunication Computer (CCC) 

• Central Information Display (CID) 

• Audio Amplifier 

• FM Antenna (utilizing the diversity module) 

• Designated FM Tuner (inside CCC) 

CarCommunication Computer 

The RTTI system utilizes the digitize maps starting with the 
2007.1 version DVD. 

The system also utilizes the double tunerfeature of the CCC to 
constantly receive traffic messages whenever RTTI is enabled. 

Because of the double tuner, the system is capable of receiving 
traffic information even if the audio source selected is in the 
FM or AM band. 





















Principles of Operation 


Real Time Traffic Information is delivered to the vehicle over a 
comprehensive network of FM radio stations managed by Clear 
Channel Broadcasting, the nation's #1 FM broadcasting compa¬ 
ny; operating an extensive network of over 1200 FM stations in 
United States. ClearChannel's Real Time Total Traffic Network is 
operational 24 hours, 7 days per week. 

0 nee enabled by the driver in the settings iM enu, the traffic 
receiver is always on and receives data in the background regard¬ 
less of the driver's audio entertainment operating status or source. 

Real Time traffic information is received by a dedicated tuner with¬ 
in the radio and the service is available whenever the vehicle is 
within range of signal in a covered market. 

The symbol, TI+(TI from 3/07) is displayed on the lower status 
bar of the navigation screen whenever a traffic signal is available. 
The traffic information events are updated every 4 minutes auto¬ 
matically by the service provider. To further ensure best in class 
service, most markets have redundant or backup transmission 
capabilities. 

OtherTechnology 

Until now current OEM traffic services were only available viaXM 
and Sirius. Both providers utilize data provided by a NAVTEQ traf¬ 
fic database; this database uses multiple external vendors who 
supply the data. These services are primarily aftermarket driven 
supporting such devices Alpine, Siemens, Garmin and TomTom. 

This service would require a monthly service charge for both the 
satellite radio as well as the traffic information. 


Enabling the Service 


The RTTI feature has to be enabled on the vehicle using the fifth 
menu of the iDrive concept using the following path: 


Settings =>Traffic info 



The lower portion of the Traffic Info page displayed on the CID 
menu will show the available FM radio stations that are broadcast¬ 
ing RTT I compatible traffic information. 


The user can select the desired station or allow the second tuner 
in the CCC to automatically select the station for them by using 
the iDrive controller. 


Note: It is recommended that the radio should be set to 
"Auto" so that the system will receive data from the 
station with the strongest received signal. 


Note: NAVTEQ navigation data is separate from NAVTEQ 
traffic data.

be displayed without a symbol in the middle. 

This is due to the screen resolution not allowing 
more than one warning icon to be displayed. 
Zooming out allows fora greater detail to be dis¬ 
played.

Utilizing RTTIto its Fullest Potential 

The RTTI system can display traffic incidents on the map in the 
following three ways: 

• No destination entered 

• Destination entered with dynamic (automatic) route 
compensation 

• Destination entered 

No Destination Entered 

RTTI can be utilized even if a destination is not entered in the 
navigation menu by displaying the map (as long as RTTI is 
enabled in the fifth (settings) menu). 

All the incident icons will be displayed in white. 

Destination Entered 

To enable the RTTI feature if a destination is selected the only 
prerequisite is that RTTI is enabled in the fifth (settings) menu. 

The icons will be displayed in two distinct colors (white or yellow) 
dependent on whetherthe incident is in the planned route.

Dynamic routing is the most advanced level of using the RTTI 
service, with this option the system will automatically route the 
vehicle around delay incidents without notifying the driver, no 
pop-up warnings will ever be displayed. 


To enable the RTTI feature when a destination is selected, select 
Dynamic Route under Route Criteria in the Navigation menu.
