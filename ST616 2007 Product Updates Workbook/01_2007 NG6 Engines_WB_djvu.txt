New NG6 Engines for 2007 



Previously in 2005, BMW introduced the beginning of a new gen¬ 
eration of six cylinder engines with the N52. Now, for the 2007 
model year, BMW has 3 new variations of the NG6 engine family. 

The first of the new engines is the N54, which will debut in the 
new 3-series coupe in September 2006. The N54 engine is 
turbocharged and uses the second generation of direct injection 
(Dl 2). This engine will powerthe new 335i coupe in the fall of 
2006. 


The N52 will eventually be replaced by the new N52KP. The N52 
KP engine is an improved and cost optimized version of the N52. 
The N52 KP will be available in the 328i and xi coupe from 
September and will replace the N52 in various models. 



N52 Engine 

(N51 similar in appearance) 


Finally, the N51 which is a SULEV II compatible engine, will be 
phased into selected production models from 9/06. The N51 
features many of the same features of the previous SULEV engine 
(M56) including a "Zero Evap" system.

New NG6 Versions 

The new N54 engine is designated the "N54B3000". The "0" in 
the engine designation indicates the "upper” output range. 

The last digit, which is a "0", indicates the first version in this range 
of engines (N54). If the N54 engine is updated, then the last digit 
will change to a "1" rather than the former "TU" suffix. 

The N52KP, which replaces the N52, will have three possible 
variants as shown below: 

N52B3001 


N52B30M1 


N52B30U1 


New Vehicles for 2007 

The new engine variants will be initially installed into some new and 
updated vehicles for 2007. The new E92 coupe will be available 
with the N54B3000 (335i) and the N52B30M1 (328i). 



The N52B30O1 will be initially available in the E83 LCI (X3 3.0si) 
from 9/2006 and the new E70 (X5 3.0si)from SOP. 


All of the N52KP engines have a last digit of "1", which indicates 
that "KP” engines are an updated version of the N52. There are 
three variants, the upper output (0), the medium output (M) and 
the lower output (U). Each engine has specific characteristics and 
power output. The "0" engine has 260 horsepower, while the "M 
version has about 230 horsepower. The "U" engine is a possible 
future variant with 215 horsepower. 



The N51 engine uses the designation - "N51B30M0”. This 
engine is SULEV II compliant with 230 horsepower. 



















Engine Mechanical Overview 


Crankcase 

As far as the physical appearance and dimensions, the crankcase 
on the N54 is the same as the N52. The main change is in the 
materials, the N54 uses an all aluminum alloy crankcase. There is 
also cast iron cylinder liners similar to the previous M 54 engine. 

The reason for using the all aluminum configuration is to be more 
compatible with the increased torque output and cylinder pressure 
in the N54. 



N54 crankcase - all aluminum alloy 


The N54 engine continues to use the "two-piece” crankcase 
featuring the "bedplate” design. 


The N52KP and N51 engines continue to use the composite 
magnesium/aluminum alloy engine from the existing N52. 



Note: The N54 engine 
has a different bolt pat¬ 
tern on the 

transmission mounting 
(bellhousing) area. 
Therefore, a new special 
tool is needed to mount 
the engine to an engine 
stand. The new tool has 
slots which will accom¬ 
modate all NG6 engines 



2007 NG6 Engines Workbook

2007 NG6 Engines Workbook 


Bolts 

Although, the N54 engine has an all aluminum crankcase, many of 
the bolts are still aluminum as on the N52. This is to reduce any 
potential confusion between steel and aluminum bolts. Some 
bolts, for example, are steel such as the cylinder head cover bolts. 
This is possible, due to the plastic cylinder head cover. 



The N52KP and N51 engines use the same aluminum bolt config¬ 
uration as the N52 engine, with little change. The cylinder head 
cover bolts are like the N54 - steel, due to the plastic cylinder head 
cover. 

The same rules apply to the 
handling of aluminum bolts as 
in the past. 

Strict adherence to repair 
instructions is required to 
ensure proper connections. 

Be sure to follow the proper 
torque/tightening angle 
sequence as outlined in the 
"tightening torques" section of 
TIS. 



Cylinder Head Cover 

As stated before, the cylinder head cover used on all of the new 
NG6 engines is made from plastic. However, the design differs 
between the engines due to engine equipment. 


For example, the N54 engine does not use Valvetronic and 
therefore does not need the accommodation for the VVT motor. 
Also, the crankcase ventilation system is different on the N54. 
Some of the crankcase venting components are integrated into the 
cylinder head cover such as the cyclone separator. 

The N52KP and N51 engines have the same cylinder head cover. 
The cover also includes some of the crankcase venting system 
components. 



Note: Some engines with plastic cylinder head covers 
may have aluminum bolts. 









Cylinder Head 

Each of the new NG6 engines has a unique cylinder head design. 
Due to some of the technical requirements, the cylinder heads are 
not interchangeable between these engines. The cylinder head 
from the N52KP is carried overfrom the N52 with little change. 

The cylinder head from the N54 engine does not have Valvetronic. 
The design ofthe engine also requires accommodation ofthe 
"direct" fuel injector in the the combustion chamber. Most of the 
external dimensions are the same as the N52 to accommodate 
accessories and ancillary components. 

The N51 engine is a SULEV II compliant design which has a lower 
compression ratio. The combustion chamber design has been 
modified to work in conjunction with the N51 piston to achieve the 
required emission goals. 



Valvetrain 

The valvetrain on the N52 introduced in 2006, used 5 mm valve 
stems on both the intake and exhaust. To increase durability, the 
exhaust valve stems were increased to 6 mm from 6/06 production. 

All ofthe new NG6 engine have adopted the 6 mm valve stem for 
the exhaust, the intake stem remains at 5mm. The valves are of 
the "solid" type design (not Sodium filled). The diameter ofthe 
valve head is engine specific. 

Camshafts 

The lightweight hydroformed camshaft will still be used on the 
NG6 engines. Be aware that some engines may use the "cast" 
camshaft design. This is for supply and production reasons. 

Cast and hydroformed camshafts are completely interchangeable. 
For example, a replacement camshaft may differfrom the original. 
This is no problem, they will fit and work properly without any 
modifications.

VANOS 

The infinitely variable Bi-VANOS system is still in use on all NG6 
engines. The VANOS system still retains the use of the lightweight 
VANOS adjusting units introduced on the N52. The only change 
to the system is that the N54 engine uses different spread ranges 
for compatibility with turbocharged engine operation.

Note: Do not mix up the intake and exhaust VANOS units. 
They appear similar, but have different spread ranges. 
Improper installation can result in valvetrain damage. 


Valvetronic 

The N51 and N52KP engines retain the already proven Valvetronic 
system from the N52. The only change for 2007 is an optimized 
VVT motor which has already been in production from 5/06. 

The N54, on the other hand, does not use the Valvetronic system. 
Valvetronic is designed to reduce pumping losses and improve 
engine efficiency. The turbocharging system on the N54 is also 
designed to reduce pumping losses and increase engine efficiency. 

Therefore, there is no need to have both systems on one engine. 

In summary, the efficiency of the N54 is gained through exhaust 
turbocharging and direct injection ratherthan Valvetronic. 

Valvetronic II - used on N52, N52KP and N51 























Gaskets and Seals 


C ranks haft Drive C omponents 


Head Gasket 

The head gasket design on 
the N54 is unique to that 
engine. 

It features a multi-layer steel 
design. There is no silicone 
rubber perimeter "shelf” as on 
the N52. This is not needed 
due to the aluminum block on 
the N54. 

The N52KP and N51 engines 
are still using the head gasket 
that is familiar from N52. 



Oil Pan Gasket 

All ofthe new NG6 engine use 
the same oil pan gasket as 
introduced on the N52. 

The oil pan gasket design is 
compatible with the N54, 
therefore it was not necessary 
to create an additional part. 

Bedplate Sealing 

The N54 continues to use the 
injected sealant method for 
the bedplate. 



Crankshaft 

The crankshaft on the N52KP and N51 remains a cast iron design. 
This crankshaft is carried over from the N52. 

The additional torque generated by the N54 requires the use of a 
forged steel crankshaft. 

Piston and Connecting Rods 

Due to the design requirements of each ofthe new NG6 engines, 
the piston design is unique to each version. For instance, the N54 
is turbocharged and direct injected and requires a piston which 
meets the design requirements for compression and mixture 
formation. 

The N51 engine need a piston which has lower compression and 
meets the SULEV II requirements foremission compliancy. 

The N52KP and N52 engines both use the same piston design. 

The connecting rods on the new engines use a thicker beam 
design which has been in production on the N52 since 6/06. The 
N54 has a special connecting rod with M9 bolts instead ofthe M8 
bolts on the other engines. 

Torsional Vibration Damper 

The vibration damper has been updated to improve the damping of 
first order vibrations. The damper is secured with new bolts and 
has a revised tightening procedure. The procedure differs from the 
N52 and should therefore not me mixed up. Damage to the belt 
drive can result from improper tightening procedures.

Intake Manifold 


Intake Manifold - N54 


The plastic intake manifold from the N52 is carried over to the new 
NG6 engines. However, the 3-Stage DISA version of the intake 
manifold is only used on the "0” version (high output). 

The current N51 engine is designated as a medium output "M" 
version at 230 hp and does not require the 3-stage DISA. The 
same applies to the "M ” version of the N52KP engine as well. 

There are small modifications to these intake manifolds due to the 
fact that the crankcase ventilation system has been updated. 

As far as the N54 engine is concerned, the intake manifold is 
designed specifically forthe turbocharging system. The N54 does 
not require DISA as turbocharging supplies the necessary torque 
increase when needed.

C rankcase Ventilation 

One ofthe major changes on the new NG6 engines is that the 
crankcase ventilation system has been upgraded and improved. 
This applies to all ofthe new NG6 versions (N52KP, N51 and N54). 

There are two distinct versions of crankcase ventilation. One type 
is unique to the N54 and the other applies to N51 and N52KP. 

The N52, which is still in production continues to use the "external" 
crankcase ventilation system with the electrically heated crankcase 
ventilation valve/cyclone separator. 


Crankcase Ventilation System on N52 



Crankcase Ventilation (N51 and N52KP) 

The crankcase ventilation system on the N51 and N52KP has 
been modified as compared to the N52. The system is integrated 
into the plastic cylinder head cover. 

The crankcase gases are regulated by a crankcase ventilation valve 
similarto the design used on the N62. The crankcase vent valve is 
currently part ofthe cylinder head cover and is not replaceable as a 
separate component. 

Oil separation is carried out via a "labyrinth" system and two 
cyclone separators which are incorporated into the cylinder head 
cover. By having the system components integrated into the 
cylinder head cover, the crankcase gases are heated by the engine 
rather than an electric heater as on the N52. However, there is still 
one electric heating element at the manifold inlet. 

Once the liquid oil is separated from the crankcase vapors, the oil is 
allowed to drain back through check valves back into the engine.

Integrated 
cyclone separator

Crankcase vent valve 





Crankcase Ventilation (N54) 

Since the N54 is a turbocharged engine, the crankcase ventilation 
system has to meet certain design requirements. For example, 
when the engine is in turbocharged mode, the increased manifold 
pressure should not have an adverse effect on the crankcase 
venting. This is why, there is no crankcase ventilation valve in the 
system. 

The system consists of four small cyclone separators which are 
integrated into the plastic cylinder head cover. The flow of 
crankcase gases is metered through a series of restrictions which 
control the ultimate crankcase pressure. 


Cyclone Separator Operation 



One ofthe main operating principles behind the crankcase venting 
system on the N54 is that there are two strategies - one for the 
turbocharged mode and onefor"non-turbocharged" operation 
such as decel. These strategies are dependent upon the intake 
manifold pressure.

Air Management 


Air Management N52KP and N51 

As far as the air management system on the N52KP and N51 
engines is concerned, the previous intake manifold system on the 
N52 is carried over. Depending upon application, the engines will 
use the 3-stage DISA orthe single stage (No DISA) intake mani¬ 
fold. 

For more information on the DISA system referto the previous 
training material in the training course "ST501 - New Engine 
Technology”. 



Throttle Valve 

All variants of the new NG6 engines receive the new EGAS 08 
throttle by Siemens/VDO. The new throttle uses a plastic throttle 
valve and magneto-resistive feedback to the ECM. 

The previous system used a potentiometer, whereas the new 
throttle uses a "contactless" system featuring magneto-resistive 
technology which is familiar from the eccentric shaft sensor on 
Valvetronic systems. 



The magneto-resistive sensors are integrated into the housing 
cover. The sensors are also non-wearing. 

For plausibility, the one sensor outputs the analog signal in the 
range from 0.3 to 4.6 V and the other sensor inverts it again from 
4.6 to 0.3 V. 

Consequently, the contact force is 10 times greater than that of a 
conventional plug connector. 

Note: It is possible to twistthe connector before plugging 
it in. This can cause damage to the harness and 
connector. 








Air Intake Ducting 

With regard to the N54 engine, the air intake ducting plays a 
significant role due to the requirements of a turbocharged engine. 

In principle, the energy of the escaping exhaust gases is utilized to 
"pre-compress” the inducted fresh air and thus introduce a greater 
air mass into the engine. This is only possible if the air intake 
ducting is "leak-free” and installed properly.

It is important to note, when carrying out work on the air-intake 
ducting, it is important to ensure that the components are installed 
in the correct position and that all pipes are connected with tight 
seals. 

A leaking system may result in erroneous boost pressure. This 
would be detected by the engine management system and will ulti¬ 
mately result in "limp-home” operation. There would also be a 
noticeable reduction in engine power. 

For some of the ductwork, there are special tools to ensure proper 
connections.

The fresh air is drawn in via the air cleaner (10) and the charge-air 
suction lines (6 +18) by the compressors of turbochargers (23 + 
24) and compressed. 

Because the turbochargers can get very hot during operation, they 
are connected with the engine's coolant and engine-oil circuits. 
The charge air is greatly heated when it is compressed in the 
turbocharger, making it necessary for the airto be cooled again in 
an intercooler (16). 


The compressed and cooled charge air is routed from the inter¬ 
cooler via the throttle valve (12) into the intake manifold. 

The system is equipped with several sensors and actuators in 
order to ensure that the load of fresh air is optimally adapted to the 
engine's respective operating conditions. How these complex 
interrelationships are controlled is discussed in the following 
sections.

2007 NG6 Engines Workbook 


Exhaust Gas Turbocharging 

The turbocharger is driven by the engine's exhaust gases, i.e. 
exhaust gases underpressure are routed by the turbocharger 
turbine and in this way delivers the motive force to the compressor, 
which rotates on the same shaft. 

It is here that the induction air is precompressed in such a way that 
a higher air mass is admitted into the engine's combustion cham¬ 
ber. In this way, it is possible to inject and combust a greater quan¬ 
tity of fuel, which increases the engine's power output and torque. 

The turbine and the compressor can rotate at speeds of up to 
200,000 rpm. The exhaust inlet temperature can reach a maximum 
of 1050°C. Because of these high temperatures, the N54 engine's 
turbochargers are not only connected with the engine-oil system 
but also integrated in the engine-coolant circuit. 

It is possible in conjunction with the N54 engine's electric coolant 
pump even after the engine has been switched off to dissipate the 
residual heat from the turbochargers and thus prevent the lube oil 
in the bearing housing from overheating.

Bi-turbocharging 

Utmost importance is attached to turbocharger response in the 
N54 engine. A delayed response to the driver's command, i.e. the 
accelerator-pedal position, is not acceptable. The driver therefore 
must not experience any so-called "turbo lag". 

This requirement is met in the N54 engine with two small tur¬ 
bochargers, which are connected in parallel. Cylinders 1, 2 and 3 
(bank 1) drive the first turbocharger (5) while cylinders 4, 5 and 6 
(bank 2) drive the second (2). 

The advantage of a small turbocharger lies in the fact that, as the 
turbocharger runs up to speed, the lower moment of inertia of the 
turbine causes fewer masses to be accelerated, and thus the 
compressor attains a higher boost pressure in a shorter amount of 
time.

Boost-pressure Control 

The boost pressure of the turbochargers is directly dependent on 
the flow of exhaust gas which reaches the turbocharger turbines. 
Both the velocity and the mass of the exhaust-gas flow are directly 
dependent on engine speed and engine load. 

The engine-management system uses wastegate valves to control 
the boost pressure. These valves are operated by vacuum-pressure 
actuators, which are controlled by the electro-pneumatic pressure 
transducers via the engine-management system.

The vacuum pressure is generated by the permanently driven vac¬ 
uum pump and stored in a pressure accumulator. The system is 
designed to ensure that these loads and consumers do not have a 
negative influence on the brake-boost function. 

The exhaust-gas flow can be completely or partially directed to the 
turbine wheel with the wastegate valves. When the boost pressure 
has reached its desired level, the wastegate valve begins to open 
and direct part of the exhaust-gas flow past the turbine wheel. 

This prevents the turbine from further increasing the speed of the 
compressor. This control option allows the system to respond to 
various operating situations. 

In the idle phase, the wastegate valves of both turbochargers are 
closed. This enables the full exhaust-gas flow available to be 
utilized to speed up the compressor already at these low engine 
speeds. 

When power is then demanded from the engine, the compressor 
can deliverthe required boost pressure without any noticeable time 
lag. In the full-load situation, the boost pressure is maintained at a 
consistently high level when the maximum permissible torque is 
reached by a partial opening of the wastegate valves. In this way, 
the compressors are only ever induced to rotate at a speed which 
is called for by the operating situation. 

The process of the wastegate valves opening, removes the drive 
energy from the turbine such that no further increase in boost pres¬ 
sure occurs, which in turn improves overall fuel consumption. 

At full-load the N54 engine operates at an overpressure of up to 
0.8 bar in the intake manifold. 















Blow-off Control 

The blow-off valves in the N54 engine reduce unwanted peaks in 
boost pressure which can occur when the throttle valve closes 
quickly. They therefore have an important function with regard to 
engine acoustics and help to protect the turbocharger compo¬ 
nents. 

A vacuum pressure is generated in the intake manifold when the 
throttle valve is closed at high engine speeds. This leads to a 
build-up of high dynamic pressure after the compressor which 
cannot escape because the route to the intake manifold is blocked.

This leads to a "pumping up" of the turbocharger which means 
that: 

• a clearly noticeable, disruptive pumping noise can be heard, 

• and this pumping noise is accompanied by a component¬ 
damaging load being exerted on the turbocharger, since high- 
frequency pressure waves exert axial load on the turbocharger 
bearings. 

The blow-off valves are mechanically actuated spring-loaded 
diaphragm valves which are activated by the intake-manifold pres¬ 
sure as follows: 

In the event of a pressure differential before and afterthe throttle 
valve, the blow-off valves are opened by the intake-manifold pres¬ 
sure and the boost pressure is diverted to the intake side of the 
compressor. The blow-off valves open starting from a differential 
pressure of 0.3 bar. This process prevents the disruptive and 
component-damaging pumping effect from occurring. 

The system design dictates that the blow-off valves are also 
opened during operating close to idle (pressure differential 
Pcharger/Psuction =0.3 bar). However, this has no further effects 
on the turbocharging system. 

The turbocharger is pressurized with the full exhaust-gas flow at 
these low speeds and already builds up a certain level of induction¬ 
airprecharging in the range close to idle. 

If the throttle valve is opened at this point, the full boost pressure 
required is very quickly made available to the engine. 

One of the major advantages of the vacuum pressure-actuated 
wastegate valves is that they can be partially opened in the 
mid-range in order not to allow excessive induction-air precharging 
to the detriment of fuel consumption. In the upper load range, they 
assume the required control position corresponding to the 
necessary boost pressure.

Charge-airCooling 

Cooling the charge air in the N54 engine serves to increase power 
output as well as reduce fuel consumption. The charge air heated 
in the turbocharger by its component temperature and by com¬ 
pression is cooled in the intercooler by up to 80°C. 

This increases the density of the charge air, which in turn improves 
the charge in the combustion chamber. This results in a lower level 
of required boost pressure. The risk of knock is also reduced and 
the engine operates with improved efficiency. 



Load Control 

Load control of the N54 engine is effected by means of the throttle 
valve and the waste gate valves. 

The throttle valve is the primary component in this process. The 
wastegate valves are actuated to bring about a fine tuning of the 
boost pressure. At full load the throttle valve is completely open 
and load control is undertaken by the wastegate valves. 











































Controlled Variables 

The following variables, among others, influence control of the N54 

engine's boost 

pressure: 

• Intake-air temperature 

• Engine speed 

• Throttle-valve position 

• Ambient pressure 

• Intake-manifold pressure 

• Pressure before the throttle valve (reference variable) 

The electropneumatic pressure transducers are activated by the 
engine control uniton the basis of these variables. The result of this 
activation can be checked from the boost pressure achieved, which 
is measured before the throttle valve. 

There follows a comparison of the boost pressure achieved with 
the setpoint data from the program map, which can if necessary 
give rise to an activation correction. The system therefore controls 
and monitors itself during operation. 

■ Limp-home Mode 

In the event during operation of malfunctions, implausible values or 
failure of any ofthe sensors involved in turbocharger control, activa¬ 
tion of the wastegate valves is shut down and the valve flaps are 
thus fully opened. Turbocharging ceases at this point. 


The list below sets out those components orfunctional groups of 
the N 54 engine in which a failure, a malfunction or implausible val¬ 
ues result in boost-pressure control being deactivated. 

The driver is alerted to a fault of this type via an EML indication. 

• High-pressure fuel system 

• InletVANOS 

• ExhaustVANOS 

• Crankshaft sensor 

• Camshaft sensor 

• Boost-pressure sensor 

• Knock sensors 

• Intake-air temperature sensor 

One principle of vehicle repair is particularly important in this 
respect: 

It is important to focus on the causes 
rather than the effects. 

With regard to diagnosis ofthe turbocharging system, always 
check the basics first. Look at such items as the vacuum hoses, 
the solenoids and the vacuum reservoir. 

Don't overlook the fundamentals. Check compression, fuel system 
pressure (low and high), secondary ignition components etc. 

The turbochargers are usually the last item to fail, but often one of 
the first items to be replaced.

2007 NG6 Engines Workbook 


Turbocharger Diagnosis 

There are three "Golden Rules" to adhere to when diagnosing 
concerns on the N54 engine: 

1. When diagnosing cases of smoke from the exhaust, it is 
important to avoid unnecessary replacement of the 
turbochargers. Smoke can be caused by oil consumption 
such as the crankcase ventilation system. Always evaluate the 
crankcase venting system completely before condemning any 
turbocharger components. Also, any engine is also subject to 
the usual causes such as valve guide wear or piston ring 
issues as on non-turbocharged engines. 

2. Turbocharger damage is usually caused by- 

• Insufficient lubrication and subsequent bearing and seal 
failure. 

• Foreign bodies can damage the turbine and/or impeller. 

• Oil contamination 

• Restricted air filter 

• Ensure that all ductwork connections are tight and "leak- 
free". This situation can also result in engine noise. 

3. Do not make any alterations or modifications to the 

turbocharger. Do not make any adjustments to the boost Note: No Modifications to the turbochargers are permitted. 

control linkage or any part of the turbocharger. Higher than 
normal boost pressure may have adverse and detrimental 
effects on the engine. Any modification will cause the engine 
management to enter in the "limp-home" program and will 
reduce performance and engine reliability.

Some new NG6 engines use a digital HFM. The output ofthe sensor is converted to a digital signal.This eliminates the need forsignal 
conversion in the ECM. The signal corresponds proportionally to changes in air mass. The N54 engine uses a virtual HFM. The signal 
is "calculated" in the ECM from various parameters such as engine speed, intake air temperature, throttle position etc.

supply components are also carried over with regard to the EKP 
module, fuel pump etc. 



N54 Engine 

The N54 engine uses the new High Precision Injection (HPI) 
system. The HPI system is a "direct"fuel injection system which 
represents the second generation "Dl" system from BMW. The 
first generation was on the N73 engine from 2003. 


The N73 engine used a "wall guided" method of injection which 
used a recess in the piston to aid in mixture formation. The HPI 
system on the N54 uses a "spray guided" process which allows 
the mixture to form and ignite without the aid of any "walls" (i.e 
piston, cylinder wall etc.). 

The spray guided system allows for more efficiency by cooling the 
cylinder charge without excessive cooling of the associated 
engine components. The wall guided system cools the piston 
crown which reduces thermal efficiency. 

The HPI system also uses the new "piezo-electric"fuel injectors 
which are a vital components of the spray guided process. These 
new injectors open in an outward direction, which forms a precise 
tapered spray pattern. 

With the aid of high system pressure (200 bar), the HPI system is 
now capable of providing new levels of efficiency which were not 
achievable with previous manifold injection systems.

HPI Function 

The fuel is delivered from the fuel tank by the electric fuel pump via 
the feed line (5) at an "feed” pressure of 5 bar to the high pressure 
pump. The feed pressure is monitored by the low-pressure sensor 
(6). The fuel is delivered by the electric fuel pump in line with 
demand. 

If this sensorfails, the electric fuel pump continues to run at 100 % 
delivery with terminal 15 ON. 

The high pressure pump is driven "in-tandem” with the vacuum 
pump which is driven by the oil pump chain drive assembly. 

The fuel is compressed in the permanently driven three-plunger 
high-pressure pump (8) and delivery through the high-pressure line 
(9) to the rail (3). The fuel accumulated under pressure in the rail in 
this way is distributed via the high-pressure lines (1) to the piezo 
injectors (2). 

The required fuel delivery pressure is determined by the engine- 
management system as a function of engine load and engine 
speed. The pressure level reached is recorded by the high-pres¬ 
sure sensor (4) and communicated to the engine control unit. 

Control is effected by the fuel-supply control valve (7) byway of a 
setpoint/actual-value adjustment of the rail pressure. Configuration 
of the pressure is geared towards best possible consumption and 
smooth running of the N54 engine. 200 bar is required only at 
high load and low engine speed.

High Pressure Pump Function and Design 

The fuel is delivered via the supply passage (6) at the admission 
pressure generated by the electric fuel pump to the high-pressure 
pump. From there, the fuel is directed via the fuel supply control 
valve (4) and the low-pressure non-return valve (2) into the fuel 
chamber (14) of the plunger-and-barrel assembly. The fuel is 
placed underpressure in this plunger-and-barrel assembly and 
delivered via the high pressure non-return valve (9) to the high 
pressure port (7).

The high-pressure pump is connected with the vacuum pump via 
the drive flange (11) and is thus also driven by the chain drive, 
i.e. as soon as the engine is running, the three plungers (12) are 
permanently set into up-and-down motion via the pendulum disc 
( 10 ). 

Fuel therefore continues to be pressurized for as long as new fuel 
is supplied to the high-pressure pump via the fuel-supply control 
valve (4). The fuel-supply control valve is activated by means of the 
engine management connection (3) and thereby admits the 
quantity of fuel required. 

Pressure control is effected via the fuel-supply control valve by 
opening and closing of the fuel supply channel. The maximum 
pressure in the high-pressure area is limited to 245 bar. 

If excessive pressure is encountered, the high-pressure circuit is 
relieved by a pressure-limiting valve via the ports (8 and 5) leading 
to the low-pressure area. 

This is possible without any problems because of the non-com¬ 
pressibility of the fuel, i.e. the fuel does not change in volume in 
response to a change in pressure. The pressure peak created is 
compensated for by the liquid volume in the low-pressure area. 

Volume changes caused by temperature changes are compensat¬ 
ed for by the thermal compensator (1), which is connected with the 
pump oil filling. 

































































































Pressure Generation in High-pressure Pump 

The plunger (2) driven by the pendulum disc presses oil (red) into 
the metal diaphragm (1) on its upward travel. The resulting change 
in volume of the metal diaphragm thereby reduces the available 
space in the fuel chamber. The fuel thereby placed under pressure 
(blue) is forced into the rail. 


The fuel-supply control valve controls the fuel pressure in the rail. 

It is activated by the engine management system via a pulse-width 
modulated (PWM) signal. 


Depending on the activation signal, a restrictor cross-section of 
varying size is opened and the fuel-mass flow required forthe 
respective load point is set. There is also the possibility of reducing 
the pressure in the rail.

Limp-home Mode 

If a fault is diagnosed in the system, such as e.g. failure of the high- 
pressure sensor, the fuel-supply control valve is de-energized; the 
fuel then flows via a so-called bypass into the rail. 

In the event of HPI limp-home mode, turbocharging is deactivated 
by an opening of the wastegate valves. 

Causes of HPI limp-home mode can be: 

• Implausible high-pressure sensorvalues 

• Failure of the fuel-supply control valve 

• Leakage in the high-pressure system 

• Failure ofthe high-pressure pump 

• Failure ofthe high-pressure sensor

Fuel System Safety 

Working on this fuel system is only permitted after the engine has 
cooled down. The coolant temperature must not exceed 40 °C. 
This must be observed without fail because otherwise there is a 
danger of fuel sprayback on account ofthe residual pressure in the 
high-pressure system. 

When working on the high-pressure fuel system, take particular 
care to ensure conditions of absolute cleanliness and follow the 
work sequences described in the repair 
instructions. Even the tiniest contaminant's and damage to the 
screw connections on the high-pressure lines can cause leaks.

Piezo Fuel Injectors 

It is the outward-opening piezo-injector that renders possible 
spray-directed direct injection and thus the overall innovations of 
the N54 engine. Due to the fact that only this component ensures 
that the injected fuel spray cone remains stable, even under the 
prevailing influences of pressure and temperature in the combus¬ 
tion chamber. 

This piezo-injector permits injection pressures of up to 200 bar and 
extremely quick opening of the nozzle needle. In this way, it is pos¬ 
sible to inject fuel into the combustion chamber under conditions 
released from the power cycles limited by the valve opening times. 

The piezo-injector is integrated together with the spark plug 
centrally between the inlet and exhaust valves in the cylinder head. 
This installation position prevents the cylinder walls or the piston 
crown from being wetted with injected fuel. A uniform formation of 
the homogeneous air/fuel mixture is obtained with the aid of the 
gas movement in the combustion chamber and a stable fuel spray 
cone. 



The gas movement is influenced on the one hand by the geometry 
of the intake passages and on the other hand by the shape of the 
piston crown. 

The injected fuel is swirled in the combustion chamber with the 
boost air until a homogeneous mixture is available throughout the 
compression space at the point of ignition. 

Note: When working on the fuel system of the N54 engine, it is 
important to ensure that the ignition coils are not fouled by fuel. 

The resistance of the silicone material is significantly reduced by 
heavy fuel contact. This can cause secondary ignition misfires. 

• Before performing any repairs to the fuel system, remove the 
ignition coils without fail and protect the spark-plug slot 
againstthe ingress offuel with a cloth. 

• Before refitting the piezo-injector, remove the ignition coils and 
ensure conditions of absolute cleanliness. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced. 

Injector Design and Function 

The piezo-injector essentially consists of three sub-assemblies. 
The expansion of the energized piezo-element lifts the nozzle 
needle outwards from its valve seat. To be able to counter the 
different operating temperatures with comparable valve lifts, the 
injector has a thermal compensating element. 

The nozzle needle is pressed outwards from its tapered valve seat. 
This opens up an annular orifice. The pressurized fuel flows 
through this annular orifice and forms a hollow cone, the spray 
angle of which is not dependent on the backpressure in the 
combustion chamber.

The spray cone (1) of a piezo-injector can diverge during operation 
(2). Due to the formation of soot inside the engine, such diver¬ 
gence is perfectly normal and acceptable to a certain extent. 

If, however, spray divergence reaches the stage where it begins to 
spray the spark plug wet, the spark plug may incur damage.

This may result in damage which can effectthe spray pattern. 
Any divergence in the spray pattern can cause damage to the 
spark plug orthe engine itself. 


Note: Replace the Teflon sealing ring when fitting and removing the 
piezo-injector. This also applies when an injector that has just 
been fitted has to be removed again after an engine start. A piezo¬ 
injector provided with a new Teflon sealing ring should befitted 
as quickly as possible because the Teflon sealing ring could swell 
up. Please observe the repair instructions and follow without fail. 

When fitting, make sure that the piezo injector is correctly seated. 
The hold-down element for securing the piezo-injectors must rest 
on both injectortabs, otherwise the necessary force is not 
applied to the piezo-injector.

Injection Strategy 

Injection of the fuel mass required for the operating situation can 
take place in up to three individual injections. Which option is used 
in the relevant operating situation is dependent on engine load and 
speed. Here, the actual time resulting from the engine speed 
available for metering the fuel is an important framework quantity. 

A special situation during the operation of any engine is the range 
in which a high load occurs at low engine speed, so-called "Low 
End Torque" operation. In this operating situation, the required fuel 
mass is metered to the engine in three individual injections. 


In order to bring the catalytic converters up to operating tempera¬ 
ture as quickly as possible, the N54 engine has a catalyst-heating 
mode for when the engine is started from cold. In this mode, 
combustion heat is intentionally introduced into the exhaust train 
and not used first and foremost to develop power output. 

The point of ignition is moved to 30° (crankshaft degrees) after 
TDC. The main quantity of the required fuel is injected before T DC 
and mixed with the boost air. The piston is situated afterTDC in its 
downward travel such that the air/fuel mixture is already expanding 
again, which reduces the ignitability of the mixture. 


This results in a highly effective mixture formation which in the final 
analysis has the effect of both increasing power output and saving 
fuel.

Explanation 

1

In orderto ignite the mixture reliably, a small residual quantity of fuel 
is injected 25° afterTDC and this guarantees an ignitable mixture 
at the spark plug. This small fuel quantity therefore provides for 
ignition of the residual charge in the combustion chamber. 

This operating mode is set by the engine-management system 
after a maximum period of 60 seconds from engine starting but is 
terminated if the catalytic-converter response temperature is 
reached earlier.

Piezo Element 

The movement of the nozzle needle in the injector is generated no 
longer by a solenoid coil but rather by a piezo-element. 

A piezo-element is an electromechanical converter, i.e. it consists 
of a ceramic material which converts electrical energy directly into 
mechanical energy (force/travel). A familiar application is the piezo 
cigarette lighter - when a piezo-crystal is pressed, voltage is 
generated until a spark flashes over and the gas ignites.

Explanation 

1 

Piezo crystal - not energized

Piezo element - in multiple layers (stacked) 


In the case of the piezo-actuator, voltage is generated so that the 
crystal expands. In order to achieve greater travel, it is possible to 
design a piezo-element in several layers. 

The actuator module consists of layers of the piezo-ceramic 
material connected mechanically in series and electrically in 
parallel. The deflection of a piezo-crystal is dependent on the 
applied voltage up to a maximum deflection; the higherthe voltage, 
the greater the travel. 


Injector Adjustment 

When the injectors are manufactured, a multitude of measurement 
data is recorded at specific points in the factory. In this way, the tol¬ 
erance ranges for injector-quantity adjustment are determined and 
specified in a six-digit number combination. 

Information on the lift performance of the injector is also added for 
injector voltage adjustment. Injector adjustment is required 
because of the individual voltage demand of each piezo actuator. 
An allocation is made to a voltage demand category, which is 
included in the number combination on the injector. 

These data items are transmitted to the ECM. During engine 
operation, these values are used to compensate for deviations in 
the metering and switching performance. 

Note: When replacing an injector, it is absolutely essential¬ 
ly to carry out an injector adjustment. 











Injector Control and Adaptation 

The fuel mass required for the operating situation is injected by the 
piezo-injector into the combustion chamber. This mass can be 
influenced by three correcting variables: 

• the rail pressure 

• the injector opening time 

• and the injector opening lift 

The injector opening time and the injector opening lift are activated 
directly at the piezo injector. The opening time is controlled via the 
ti signal and the opening lift via the energy quantity in the activation 
of the piezo-injector. 

Injector Adaptation 

The fuel masses and injection cycles determined from the 
load/speed map are included in a pilot-control program map. Here, 
while further framework parameters are taken into consideration, 
the energy quantities and injector opening times required to acti¬ 
vate the injectors are determined. 

The N54 engine can be safely and reliably operated with these 
program-map values. 


Optimization 

For optimization of: 

• Emission values 

• Smooth running 

• Fuel consumption 

• Power output 

the controlled variables of energy quantities and injector opening 
times are continuously monitored. This occurs on a bank-selective 
basis by way of lambda closed-loop control. 

The residual oxygen in the exhaust gas is measured in each case 
for cylinder bank 1 and cylinder bank 2. This measurement result 
is compared with the values expected from the set correcting 
variables. The result of a deviation is that the injector opening sig¬ 
nal is adapted. This adaptation is stored in the control unit and is 
therefore available for subsequent engine operation. 

However, these stored values are lost when the system is flashed 
and must be relearned. A further adaptation of the injector activa¬ 
tion takes place depending on time and use. This cylinder-selec¬ 
tive adaptation involves a check of the residual-oxygen content with 
a conclusion as to the cylinder causing the situation. To this end, it 
is necessary for part of the exhaust-gas flow not to be swirled in the 
turbocharger. Forthis reason, the flap ofthe wastegate valve must 
be fully opened, i.e. swung out ofthe exhaust-gas flow. 

This wastegate-flap position extends beyond its normal opening 
position in engine operation. Based on the result of this cylinder- 
selective monitoring, the energy quantity is adapted if necessary to 
activate the injectors. 

Furthermore, the cylinder-selective adaptation includes if necessary 
an adaptation ofthe injector opening signal based on smooth 
running monitoring ofthe N54 engine. Overall adaptation ofthe 
injectors is limited to a 15% additional quantity.

Ignition Management 


Most of the ignition system components have remained the same 
for all NG6 engines for 2007. There are some minor changes to 
the ignition coils that apply to all versions. The coils have been 
optimized for more durability. 

Spark Plugs 

The spark plugs forthe N51 and N52KP remain the same as N52. 
However, the N54 uses a completely new spark plug from Bosch. 
The spark plug design consists of a 12mm thread which contrasts 
from the 14mm design on the N52 which prevents any possibility 
of improper installation. 


The hex on the spark plug is also a 12 point design which requires 
a special tool. The tool (socket) has a "thinwall” design to facilitate 
access in the confined area of the N54 cylinder head. 



Spark Plug Diagnosis (N54) 

Due to the proximity of the spark plug to the fuel injector nozzle, 
any divergence in the fuel spray may cause possible spark plug 
damage. This makes sparkplug diagnosis an important part of 
N54 service concerns. Information gained by the spark plug 
diagnosis may indicate possible fuel injector faults. Spark plug 
replacement interval has been reduced to 45,000 miles forthe 
N54. 

The illustrations below can be used to assist in diagnosis:

for low mileage for high mileage

diversion

Emissions Management 


The N54 and N52KP meet ULEV II requirements for 2007. There 
are not many changes to the emission systems on these engines. 
The N54 engine has 2 underbody catalysts in addition to the 
"near engine" catalysts already in use from the N52. 

The N51 engine, however, is a SULEV II compliant engine which 
meets the 2007 requirements. In addition to the 5 existing 
SULEV states of California, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, and 
Vermont - four states have been added for 2007. These states 
include, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Oregon and Washington 
State. 

The N51 emissions measures include: 

• Secondary Air System with mini-HFM 

• Radiator with "Prem-air” coating 

• Lower compression ratio (10:1) via modified combustion 
chamber and pistons 

• Underbody catalyst in addition to "near engine" catalyst 

• Activated carbon air filter in air filter housing 

• Steel fuel lines with threaded fittings and sealed fuel tank 

• Crankcase ventilation system integrated into cylinder head 
cover 

• Purge system piping made from optimized plastic 

Note: The SULEV II information above is only preliminary 
and is accurate as of 8/06. Additional information 
will be released as it becomes available.

Performance Controls 


Cooling System 


The cooling system of the N54 engine consists of a radiator circuit and an isolated oil cooling circuit. The fact that there is an isolated 
oil-cooling circuit ensures that heat is not introduced via the engine oil into the engine's coolant system. 

















































































There is a significantly greater quantity of heat on account of this 
engine's increased power of 75.5 kW/l in comparison with other 
3-liter spark-ignition engines. 

This boundary condition is satisfied by the engine cooling system 
with its increased performance. This increase in power was to be 
realized in spite of some factors less advantageous to cooling. 

Factors to be mentioned here are: 

• Approximately 15% less flow area is available on account of 
the intercooler located below the radiator. 

• The already small amount of space provided by the engine 
compartment is further limited by the accommodation of 
further components. 

• Because the exhaust turbochargers are cooled by the coolant, 
an additional quantity of heat is introduced into the system via 
these turbochargers. 

Measures for increasing cooling-system performance: 

• Coolant pump with increased power - 400 W/9000 l/h 

• Separation of water and engine-oil cooling 

• Radiator with increased power 

• Electric fan with increased power 600W for all gearbox variants 

The structure of the coolant circuit is the same as that of the N52 
engine. The engine is flushed through with coolant in accordance 
with the cross-flow concept. Cooling output can be influenced as a 
function of load by activating the following components: 

• Electric fan 

• Electric coolant pump 

• Map thermostat

It is also possible that an N54 engine equipped with an automatic 
gearbox to utilize the lower area of the radiator to cool the gearbox 
by means of the gearbox oil cooler. This is achieved as in the N52 
engine with control sleeves, which are introduced into the radiator 
tank. 

Engine-oil Cooling 

The N54 engine is equipped with a high-performance engine oil 
cooler. The pendulum slide pump delivers the oil from the oil sump 
to the oil filter. A thermostat flanged to the oil filter housing admits 
the oil to the engine-oil cooler. The engine oil cooler is located in 
the right wheel arch in the E92.The thermostat can reduce the 
resistance opposing the oil by opening the bypass line between the 
feed and return lines of the engine oil cooler. This ensures that the 
engine warms up safely and quickly.

2007 NG6 Engines Workbook 


Radiator 

Design measures have been used to increase the performance of 
the radiator itself. The performance of a radiator is dependent on 
its radiation surface. However, the intercooler location had to be 
underneath the radiator, and this meant that is was necessary to 
compensate for the smaller flow area available. 

Compared with the N52 engine, the radiator used in the N54 
engine has a block depth which has been increased to 32 mm. 

In addition, the water pipes are situated closertogetherthan in 
previously used radiators. The upshot of this is an increase in the 
utilizable radiation surface. 

Electric Coolant Pump 

The coolant pump of the N54 engine is an electrically driven cen¬ 
trifugal pump with a power output of 400W and a maximum flow 
rate of 9000 l/h. This represents a significant increase in power of 
the electric coolant pump used in the N52 engine, which has a 
power output of 200 W and a maximum flow rate of 7000 l/h. 

The power of the electric wet-rotor motor is electronically 
controlled by the electronic module (3) in the pump. The electronic 
module is connected via the bit-serial data interface (BSD) to the 
MSD80 engine control unit. 

The engine control unit uses the engine load, the operating mode 
and the data from the temperature sensors to calculate the 
required cooling output. 

Based on this data, the engine control unit issues the correspon¬ 
ding command to the electric coolant pump. The electric coolant 
pump regulates its speed in accordance with this command. 

The system coolant flows through the motor of the coolant pump, 
thus cooling both the motor as well as the electronic module. The 
coolant lubricates the bearings of the electric coolant pump.

Note: The same rules apply to all electric coolant pumps. 
The pump must be filled with coolant when removed 
for service to prevent any corrosion. Also, the pump 
impeller must be turned by hand before installation 
to ensure the pump is not seized.

2. With regard to the N54 engine, circle the TRUE statements 

and cross out the statements which are NOT true: 

• The HPI injection system is "spray guided" 

• The piezo-injectors are "ground controlled" 

• The fuel volume from the injectors is determined by the 
amount of injector opening 

• The "blow-off" valves are controlled electrically by the 
DM E 

• The load control on the N54 is controlled by the throttle 
valve and the fuel injectors 

• In deceleration mode, the crankcase blow-by gases are 
directed to the intake manifold directly 

• The injection pressure is approximately 200 bar 

• The HDP pump is driven from a additional lobe on the 
exhaust camshaft 

• The MSD80 engine management system uses an idle 
control valve to regulate idle speed on the N54 

• Both wastegates are open at idle 

• The compression ratio on the N54 is 10.2 to 1 

• The HDP pump is a "vane-type" pump 

• The piezo injectors allow multiple injection events 

• The crankcase ventilation system on the N54 has cyclone 
separators integrated into the cylinder head cover
