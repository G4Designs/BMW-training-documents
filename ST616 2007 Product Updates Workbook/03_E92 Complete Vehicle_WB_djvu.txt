Workshop Exercise - Walk Around Body 


Let's walk around the E92 and try to identify the visible features 
that BMW has implemented here that differ from the E 90 and 
from past 3 Series coupes. 


What distinctive features do you notice in the interior? 


What body styling features are noticed immediately? 


Why did BMW incorporate a seat belt extender in the design of the 
E92 interior? 


Which body components are made from Thermo-plastic? 


How is the exhaust different from the E90? What is the difference between the normal seat adjustment speed 

and the Easy-Entry seat adjustment speed? 


Open the door and inspect the interior. 

How many passengers does the E92 accommodate? 




CAS3 EWS4 


With the launch of the E92, we have a new electronic vehicle 
immobilizer. The Car Access System 3 with the new generation 
of electronic vehicle immobilizer EWS4 was introduced in E92 
vehicles with the N52/N54 gasoline engine. 

The vehicle immobilizer consists of the ID transmitter which is 
identical forthe vehicle and therefore to CAS3. CAS3 exchanges 
data with the DM E via the CAS-bus and cancels the vehicle 
immobilization function. 

The EWS4 is a new development and uses a new, modern 
encryption method. A 128 bit long secret key is assigned to each 
vehicle and stored in the BMW database. 

This secret key is known only to BMW.The secret key is pro¬ 
grammed and locked in the CAS and in the DM E control unit. 
Once entered in the control unit, the secret key can no longer be 
changed or deleted. This therefore means that each control unit is 
assigned to a specific vehicle. 

One control unit in the system sends an encrypted code to anoth¬ 
er control unit forthe purpose of checking the authorization. In 
turn, this control unit sends back a corresponding code. 

Replacement of Control Units 

The procedure described below must be followed in orderto 
replace a defective control unit (CAS/DM E).The required control 
unit is ordered together with the necessary vehicle data (VIN) from 
the Parts Department. 

A new "blank" control unit is programmed with the corresponding 
program data forthe vehicle and the secret key from the BMW 
database, locked and sent to the dealer. 


Note: No alignment procedure is necessary as in earlier 
E WS systems. S ince the control units are assigned 
to the specific vehicle, replacement with a unit from 
anothervehicle is not possible. 

The electronic vehicle immobilizer consists of several compo¬ 
nents. In the E92 these components are the CAS3 and the DM E 
M SV80/M SD80. 

The CAS3 contains the software forthe EWS4 and, with corre¬ 
sponding identification of the ID transmitter, the enable of terminal 
R, 15 and 50 forthe starter. The enable forthe ignition and fuel 
injection systems is done by the DME. 

Both control units are connected by the K-CAN, the junction box 
serving as the gateway and the PT-CAN. Data is also exchanged 
on the CAS-bus.The data is always transmitted parallel via both 
bus systems. The signals that arrive first are used. 

The DME activates the fuel injection relay for the power supply of 
the fuel injectors. The DM E features a direct line to the starter 
relay in the CAS in orderto initiate the start procedure and, if nec¬ 
essary, to terminate it, in the event of a PT-CAN fault or a faulty 
signal, like no engine speed signal. 


The new control unit is installed in the vehicle and started.

Start Enable 

The start procedure is enabled by means of a special request and 
response procedure known as challenge-response.The DME gen¬ 
erates a random number in a random generator and sends it as the 
challenge to the CAS .The CAS and the DM E contain the same 
secret key and both control units use the same calculation algo¬ 
rithm. The CAS now calculates the result from the received random 
number, the secret key and the algorithm. The result is sent as the 
CAS response to the DME. During this time, the DM E now calcu¬ 
lates the same random number with the secret key and the algo¬ 
rithm and already knows the result. The response of the CAS is 
compared with the result of the DME. Start is enabled if the result 
is identical. 

Time-based Query 

As from terminal R orterminal 15 ON, a query (challenge- 
response) is performed as long as the engine is not yet running. 

A fault code is entered in the CAS if no DM E response is received 
approximately 10 seconds afterthe start of the query or if the 
response deviates. 


Key Memory Expansion in CAS3 

The data memory of the remote key in vehicles equipped with 
CAS3 is increased from 256 bytes to 512 bytes. 

The benefit of this key memory expansion forthe customer is that 
more accurate information on the time and scope of the workshop 
visit can be provided as part of the service acceptance procedure. 

The following system network information can be read out from the 
identification transmitter with the key reader in the service work¬ 
shop.

Energy Management 


As in the current models, an energy management system is also 
used on the BMW 3 Series Coupe to ensure a balanced energy 
supply in the vehicle. The energy management functions are inte¬ 
grated in the power management system that is implemented in 
the form of software in the Engine Control Module (ECM/DME). 
The power management, the components and the various func¬ 
tions of the system differ depending on the equipment configura¬ 
tion of the vehicle. 

Two energy management control systems are installed: 

• Basic Power Management BPM 

• Advanced Power Management APM. On vehicles equipped 
with advanced power management modifications have been 
made in the terminal shut-down system through relay 30g 
and 30g_f. 

Advanced Power Management APM 

Advanced power management APM is used on vehicles featuring 
certain options. 

The advanced power management has been expanded by the 
intelligent battery sensor IBS.The IBS provides precise informa¬ 
tion on the condition of the battery. For example, the battery tem¬ 
perature is no longer calculated but measured directly by the IBS. 


In addition to the change in the idle speed and the specified 
charging voltage target value, the system includes the following 
functions that differ from the BPM. 


• Electric load reduction 

• Electric load shut-down 


• Systems network diagnosis 

• Battery diagnosis.

Terminal Shut-down Identification 

Note: To provide clear identification of the terminal shut¬ 
down function, the control units are identified with 
colored triangles. The identification and assignment 
to the individual terminals is shown in the illustration 
on page 18. 

Electric load shut-down terminal 30g relay 
Time-dependent shut-down 

The E92 is equipped with a terminal 30g relay for switching off the 
power supply to the majority of the control units. Most convenient 
electric loads such as the radio are switched off after 30 minutes 
by terminal 30g in orderto maintain the starting capability of the 
battery. 

Power to the terminal 30g relay is activated by the car access sys¬ 
tem for an extra 60 minutes if a telephone or auxiliary heating sys¬ 
tem is installed in the vehicle. 

Electric load shut-down terminal 30g_f relay 
Fault-dependent shut-down 

The terminal 30g_f relay is installed in the junction box of the E92 
only when one of the following equipment options is ordered: 

• M-Audio system controller(M-ASK) 

• Car communication computer 

• Telephone (US vehicles) 


The terminal 30g_f relay is a bi-stable relay and is always in the ON 
state under normal conditions. It switches off the connected elec¬ 
tric loads only in the case of fault. The switching status is retained 
even when no power is applied. 

The terminal 30g_f relay is activated by the junction box control 
unit and switches off the connected electric loads if a fault occurs. 

The calculations required for activating the terminal 30g f relay 
take place in the ECM/DM E and in the junction box. 

The following activities are monitored in the junction box control 
unit: 

• Unauthorized wake-ups within the bus system 

• Sleep mode preventers (control units that constantly 
keep the bus systems active) 

Note: The battery values are constantly read out and 

evaluated in the Engine Control Module (ECM/DME). 
The relay is also switched off when the starting capa¬ 
bility limit of the vehicle battery is reached.

Seat Belt Extender 


In line with its concept and design, the E92 Coupe features large 
doors. As a result, the B-pillarwith the reversal point forthe seat 
belt is located further towards the rear relative to the seat position. 
This makes the seat belt difficult to reach forthe driver orfront 
passenger. 

Forthis reason, an electrically operated seat belt extender is 
installed on the E92.The seatbelt extender extends and moves 
the seat belt out of its rest position at the B-pillarby approximately 
25 cm in the direction of the driver and front passenger. This 
makes it considerably easier and more convenient for the driver 
and front passenger to fasten the seat belt. 



Note: The side curtain airbags are now riveted, on the 
E92. Refer to the most current repair procedure 
information found in TIS. 


System Function 

The seatbelt extender system essentially consists of the footwell 
module with the masterfunctionality and the two seat belt exten¬ 
der controllers connected via the UN-BUS. 

The footwell module receives the terminal status from the car 
access system via the K-CAN. The footwell module receives fur¬ 
ther important information from the airbag control unit via the K- 
CAN.The information contains the status of the seat belt contacts 
and of the seat occupancy detection facility on the front passen¬ 
ger seat. 

The footwell module evaluates this information together with the 
determined status of the door contacts and decides whetherthe 
seat belt extenders are extended or retracted. 

The footwell module informs the seat belt controllers of this deci¬ 
sion via the LIN-bus. 

The corresponding seat belt controller activates the seat belt 
extender motor and extends or retracts the toothed rack of the 
seat belt extender. The seat belt controller evaluates the Hall sig¬ 
nals forthe speed and end position and informs the footwell mod¬ 
ule of the position. 

The functions of the seat belt extender are uniform throughout the 
world. Only a difference is made between the driver and front pas¬ 
senger in terms of functionality. 

The driver and passenger doors must be closed the key in the 
ignition orthe ignition on forthe seat belt extenders to operate.

System Components 

The system consists of the following components: 

• Controller for driver's seat belt extender GB FA 

• Controllerfor passenger's seat belt extender GBBF 

• Driver's seat belt extender 

- Seatbelt extender motor 

- Hall sensor 

- End position sensor 

• Front passenger's seat belt extender 

- Seatbelt extender motor 

- Hall sensor 

- End position sensor 

• Footwell module with sensors and LIN-bus connection 

• J unction boxfor power supply 

• Airbag control unit for sensor information 

Seat Belt Extender Controller 

The universal control unit that is also used in other systems is 
used as the controller for the seat belt extender. 

The controller for the seat belt extenders is connected via the 
LIN-bus to the footwell module.This LIN-bus has a data rate 
of 19.2 Kbit/s. 

The controllers for the driver/passenger seat belt extenders are 
identical and differ in terms of their ground coding. 

The control unit is connected by means of three plugs. Plug con¬ 
nector (1) is used forthe power supply and ground coding. This 
plug connector also features the LIN-bus connection. 


Plug connector (2) connects the end position sensor. Plug connec¬ 
tor (3) connects the motor and the speed Hall sensor. (See graphic 
on the following page.) 

The controller is located behind the side trim panel along with the 
seatbelt extender. The controller is constantly monitoring the 
extension and retraction of the seatbelt extender and it's designed 
to shutdown in the event of overvoltage (16V) or under voltage 
(9V) condition. 

S eat B elt Extender M otor 

The seat belt extender motor is a DC motor. The motor is connect¬ 
ed to the toothed rack by means of a step-down gear mechanism. 
A Hall sensor, mounted on the seat belt extender motor measures 
motor's speed. 

A Hall signal is generated for each revolution of the motor. Based 
on the number of Hall signals, the control unit always knows the 
exact position of the seat belt extender. The Hall pulses are added 
as the seat belt extender extends and the motor is switched off on 
reaching the maximum number of pulses. This represents the 
"extended" end position. 

When the seat belt extender is retracted, power is applied to the 
motor until the magnet in the toothed rack reaches the end posi¬ 
tion sensor.The system is initialized by reaching the end position. 
Initialization is performed every time the seat belt is retracted.

Blocking Detection 

If, during extension, the Hall signals are not received for 250ms, this situation is interpreted as blocking of the extender and the motor is 
switched off. The seat belt extender motor is reversed and the toothed rack retracted. 

The motor is driven for 1 second if the toothed rack is blocked. This procedure is repeated up to three times. The motor is then no longer 
activated. 

A renewed attempt to drive the motor is made only on reactivation of the system (door contact and terminal R). The system must be 
checked by a BMW dealer workshop if the system is actually blocked mechanically.

Exterior Lighting 


Compared to the E90, several changes have been made in 
the exterior lighting system of the E92: 

• The E92 is equipped with standard bi-xenon headlights. 

• Adaptive headlights with cornering lights are available 
as an option. 

• Standard daytime running light function, realized by the 
parking light corona rings. 



Welcome Lights 

The welcome lights are also a new function. The interior 
lights are activated for 20 sec. when the vehicle is unlocked 
but also the parking light corona rings, the tail lights, license 
plate lights,the doorhandle area lights and side markers. 

Note: The welcome lights operate only in automatic 
and are not activated when the light switch is in 
theO position. This provides the customer with 
the option of deactivating the system if he/she 
does not wantthis function. 

Daytime Running Lights 

The daytime running lights function is realized by the two 
corona rings in the headlights and activation of the tail lights 
and license plate lights. 

The corona rings light brighter during the day to realize the 
daytime running lights function. The brightness of the coro¬ 
na rings is reduced to that of the side lights when the low 
beam headlight is switched on by the rain/light sensor or by 
switch position 2. 




Note: Non serviceable LEDs are used for the front headlamp 
side marker and on the tail lamp, LEDs are integrated 
to fiberoptic strips to realize the rear parking light. 


E92 Complete Vehicle Workbook

E92 Complete Vehicle Workbook 


The corona rings are always switched on at terminal 15 ON.The 
corona rings are activated pulse width-modulated. The pulse width 
modulation ensures the daytime running lights and parking light 
function can be realized with one lamp bulb. 

Light distribution in headlight fordaytime running 
lightfunction 

The daytime running light uses the same corona rings as the side 
lights. Both corona rings feature a common H8 bulb.The H8 lamp 
bulb is activated differently depending on the side light or daytime 
running light function.The inner ring is illuminated from the rear by 
reflectors. The outer rings around the headlight are supplied via 
fiberoptic glass rods.The lightfromthe H8 bulb is directed by mir¬ 
rors into the fiberoptic glass rods. 

Deactivating the daytime running lights function 

The function can be deactivated if required by the customer. On 
vehicles equipped with a central information display, the function 
can be deactivated in the "Light settings" menu.The function is 
deactivated in the instrument cluster on vehicles with no CID.

Cornering Lights 

Cornering lights will be introduced forthe first time with the launch 
of the E92.They represent an expansion of the functions of the 
adaptive headlights. In addition to the adaptive headlight, the cor¬ 
nering light illuminates the area in front of and to the side the vehi¬ 
cle. 

The cornering light is integrated in the headlight where the previ¬ 
ous high beam lamp was located.The light beam is reflected to the 
side bythe special shape ofthe deflectorand the position of the 
H3 bulb. The cornering light cannot be ordered as a separate 
option as it is an added function of Adaptive Headlights (SA 524) 

The special arrangement ofthe mirrorsurface in the reflectorand 
the special shape ofthe lens deflect the light beams to the side 
while preventing forward dazzle. 

The cornering lights illuminate when the respective turn signal is 
operated and orthe steering angle sensor indicates a turn below 
40mph. 

The angle ofthe steering wheel to activate the cornering light dif¬ 
fers depending on the type of steering system used (power steer¬ 
ing or active steering), steering gear and steering gear ratio. The 
steering wheel lock to activate the cornering light when the vehicle 
is stationary is between approximately 40° and 75° depending on 
the type of steering. 

Flash to pass does not affect the cornering light nor does the haz¬ 
ard function activate it. 


Note: Both cornering lights come on when the reverse gear 
is selected to help illuminate the way.

Switch-on conditions forthe cornering lights 

The corresponding cornering lights will illuminate depending on 
the following criteria: 

• The selection of the turn signal below 65kph/40mph 

• Steering angle input while driving below 65kph/40mph 

• With vehicle stationary and engine running a steering angle of 
40° to 70°, depending on the steering system 

• With reverse gear engaged both cornering light will illuminate 


Switch-off conditions forthe cornering lights 

The cornering lights switches off in the following conditions: 

• Adaptive headlight off 

• Direction indicator off 

• Directional constantly on above 40kph/25mph 

• Steering angle is reduced (by5°-10° after switch-on condi¬ 
tion with vehicle stationary) 

• Steering angle increased while driving above 70kph/43mph 

• While drifting (Steering lock and yaw rate in opposite direc¬ 
tions) 

• While turning at a traffic light there is a 4 sec time out 

• Headlight temperature too high (headlight protection) 

• Reverse gear disengaged

Bus Systems 


With the adoption of the bus systems from the E90 with the junc¬ 
tion box as the gateway and the footwell module as a further con¬ 
trol unit with many functions, the system overview of the bus sys¬ 
tems are, to a large extent identical. 

The E90/E92 bus systems differ only slightly by the addition of 
new control units. The following changes have been made in the 
various bus systems: 

Changes in PT-CAN 

The transfer case control unit is installed in vehicles equipped with 
the xDrive all-wheel drive system option.The DSC is replaced by 
the DXC.The DXC performs the functions of the DSC and has 
been expanded to include additional all-wheel drive functions. 

Changes in MOST 

IBOC (In-Band On-Channel), a terrestrial digital radio, has been 
newly added 

Changes in K-CAN 

Further exterior lighting functions have been implemented in the 
footwell module.These functions include : 

• Daytime driving lights 

• Welcome light 

• Cornering light on vehicles with active headlight 

The tire pressure monitoring system TPM S replaces the tire fail¬ 
ure indicator RPA to conform to US legal requirements. 

The EWS 4 has been implemented in the CAS 3 on gasoline 
engine vehicles. 


A 4-channel PDC forthe rear is offered in the E92. There is no 
PDC button in the center console. 

A new addition is the front passenger seat module SMBF for eval¬ 
uating the Hall sensor of the seat forward/backward adjustment 
facility on vehicles with electrically adjustable seats forthe rear 
compartment easy entry function. 

Changes in LIN-bus 

New features in the LIN-bus include the two control units forthe 
driver and front passenger seat belt extender. 


Note: There are no changes in the F-C AN system 
northe Bit-serial Data interface (BSD).
