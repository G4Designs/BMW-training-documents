N20 Engine 
1. Introduction 


BMW has decided to bring back the 4-cylinder engine to the US market. The last BMW 4-cylinder en¬ 
gine in the US was the M44, this lasted until 1999 and was installed in the E36 318is/318ti/Z3. Since 
then BMW in the US has not had a 4-cylinder engine. The N20 engine represents the new generation 
of BMW 4-cylinder gasoline engines. It will gradually be phased in on a number of BMW models start¬ 
ing in September 2011. The N20 will replace the N52 6-cylinder naturally aspirated engines. The N20 
engine is equipped with the latest technology, such as TVDI (Turbocharged Valvetronic Direct Injec¬ 
tion) in conjunction with a TwinScroll exhaust turbocharger. As a whole, it is closely related to the N55 
engine, this is why constant reference is made to the N55 engine in this document. 


1.1. History 

The history of BMW 4-cylinder engines began back in 1927 with the BMW 3/15. From that point on, 
apart from an interruption stretching from 1936 to 1962, the 4-cylinder gasoline engines have again 
and again been the precursors to new technologies and have often also been forerunners. Thus, the 
M31 engine (predecessor of the M10 engine) was the world's first 4-cylinder production engine to fea¬ 
ture a TwinScroll exhaust turbocharger, already achieving back in 1973 a power output of 125 kW /167 
bhp from a displacement of 2 liters. In motorsport the crankcase of the Ml 0 with a displacement of 1.5 
liters produced the first Formula 1 world champion with a turbocharged engine. In motor racing perfor¬ 
mance figures of up to 1350 bhp from a displacement of 1.5 liters were achieved, figures which to date 
have only been achieved by BMW.

1.4.2. Engine identification 

The engines have an identification mark on the crankcase to ensure proper identification and classifi¬ 
cation. 

With the N55 engine, this identification was subject to a further development, with the previous eight 
positions being reduced to seven. The engine number can be found on the engine below the engine 
identification. This consecutive number, in conjunction with the engine identification, allows proper 
identification of each individual engine.

2.1.1. Engine block 

The engine block is made from diecast aluminium AISi9Cu3 along with the crankcase and the bed¬ 
plate. A new coating for the cylinder wall is being used for the first time by BMW. Its referred to as elec¬ 
tric arc wire spraying. 

The cooling jacket has also been optimized to improve cooling between the cylinders, this is due to 
the requirements of a turbocharged engine.

Compensation openings 

The crankcase features large milled longitudinal ventilation holes. These ventilation holes improve the 
pressure compensation of the oscillating air columns created by the up and down strokes of the pis¬ 
tons. 

Additional openings on the intake side on the bearing seat between the cylinders also improve 
crankcase pressure.

Cylinder 

An iron wire is used in the electric arc wire spraying process to coat the aluminium cylinder bores. High 
voltage is used to ignite an electric arc at both ends of the wire. The temperatures generated in the 
process are in the region of 3000 °C / 5432 °F. The high temperatures melt the wire, which is contin¬ 
ually fed by the wire feed unit. The molten iron is blasted onto the cylinder wall surface at pressure via 
the central and secondary compressed-air supplies. 

The liquid iron adheres to the aluminium surface through: 

• Mechanical bonding: 

Molten particles penetrate as a result of high kinetic energy and capillary action into depres¬ 
sions and undercuts, where they solidify to create a positive connection.

Advantages: 

• Spray particles adhere with the base metal 

• Ideal for thick coatings or large surfaces 

• Greatest application rate per hour of all the thermal spraying processes 

• The spray coating can barely be distinguished in terms of color from the base metal 

• The low-oxide spray coating can be processed during manufacturing like a solid material 

• High tensile strength and lower contraction strain 

• Micro-porous surface reduces friction 

• Coating properties such as coating hardness or surface quality can be determined 

• All materials can be added as coatings, such as for example ferrous/nonferrous alloy on cast 
iron 

• Low thermal stress thanks to optimized heat transfer. 


A 

The low coating thickness of about 1 mm produces optimum heat transfer but does not allow rework¬ 
ing of the cylinder bore surface in service. 

If a cylinder is determined out of specification the entire engine block must be replaced. 


2.1.2. Cylinder head gasket 

A three-layer spring steel gasket is used for the cylinder head gasket. A stopper plate (2) is welded on 
in the area of the cylinder bores in order to achieve sufficient contact pressure for sealing. All the lay¬ 
ers are coated, the contact surfaces with the cylinder head and the engine block having a partial fluo- 
rocaoutchouc (elastomer) coating with non-stick coating.

2.1.3. Cylinder head 

The cylinder head in the N20 engine is similar to the cylinder head in the N55. The 3rd generation Val- 
vetronic system introduced in the N55 is also used in the N20 engine. 

The classic VANOS with separate solenoid valve in the N55 engine has been replaced in the N20 en¬ 
gine by a central VANOS with integrated solenoid valve. The benefit of this system is a reduced num¬ 
ber of oil passages in the cylinder head. 

As in the N55 engine the N20 also uses TVDI technology. 

A_ 

The combination of exhaust turbocharger, Valvetronic and direct fuel injection is known as Turbo 
Valvtronic Direct Injection (TVDI).

2.1.4. Cylinder head cover 

Design 

The cylinder head cover is a new development. All the components for crankcase ventilation and the 
blow-by ducts are integrated. A pressure control valve prevents an excessive vacuum from being gen¬ 
erated in the crankcase. Ventilation is performed via different ducts depending on whether the engine 
is running in turbocharged or normal mode. 

In normal mode, ventilation is performed via the pressure control valve at about. 38 mbar.

Blow-by duct to the intake ports in the cylinder head 


The blow-by gases pass through the opening in the intake side area of cylinder one to the three spring 
tab separators. The oil in the blow-by gas is separated by the spring tab separators, and flows along 
the walls down through a non-return valve and back into the cylinder head. The blow-by gas cleaned 
by the oil now passes, depending on the operating state, into the air intake system. 

Function 

In naturally aspirated mode, the non-return valve in the blow-by duct of the cylinder head cover is 
opened by the vacuum pressure in the air intake system and the blow-by gases are drawn off via the 
pressure control valve. The vacuum pressure simultaneously closes the second non-return valve in the 
duct to charge-air suction line. 

The blow-by gases are routed directly into the cylinder head intake ports via the passages integrated 
in the cylinder head cover. 

A purge air line, which is connected to the fresh air pipe ahead of the turbocharger and to the 
crankcase, routes fresh air via a non-return valve directly into the crankcase. The greater the vacuum 
in the crankcase, the higher the air mass introduced. This purging prevents the pressure control valve 
from icing up by reducing moisture in the system.

Once in boost mode the pressure in the intake plenum rises, it is no longer possible for the blow-by 
gases to be introduced via this route. A non-return valve in the blow-by duct of the cylinder head cover 
closes the duct to the intake plenum and thereby protects the crankcase against excess pressure. 

The now greater fresh-air demand generates a vacuum in the fresh air pipe between the turbocharg¬ 
er and the intake silencer. This vacuum is sufficient to open the non-return valve in the cylinder head 
cover and draw off the blow-by gases directly without regulation. The pressure control valve (17) is by¬ 
passed in this mode, since only a low vacuum is generated which does not have to be limited.

2.1.5. Oil sump 

The oil sump is made from plastic for rear wheel drive vehicles and cast aluminium for xDrive models. 
For xDrive vehicles the oil sump has been modified due to the input shafts and attachment points for 
the axle drive. 

The oil pump with the counterbalance shafts covers the entire oil sump and thereby protects the 
crankshaft against “oil splashing”. The oil flowing back through the oil return passages is routed di¬ 
rectly into the oil sump and therefore cannot come into contact with the crankshaft.

Crankshaft 

The crankshaft of the N20 engine has a stroke of 89.6 mm and is made of the material C38modBY. It is 
a forged crankshaft with four balance weights and weighs 13.9 kg/30.6 lbs. 



N20 engine, crankshaft 


Crankshaft bearings and rod bearings 

The crankshaft is supported by five bearings. The thrust bearing is located in the middle at the third 
bearing position. The thrust bearing is only designed for 180° and is located in the bearing seat. The 
bearing in the bearing cap does not assume any axial guidance. Lead-free two-material bearings are 
used.

The same procedure for calculating the correct bearing size by using the crankcase and crankshaft 
codes (introduced with the N55 engine) is also used for the N20. 

The identification markings for the bearings are stamped on the crankcase and on the crankshaft. If 
the crankshaft is to be fitted with new bearings refer to the repair instructions for more information 
on the procedure to determine the correct bearing size/color.

Pin offset 

Pistons always require a running clearance. The running clearance means that there is always a cer¬ 
tain degree of lateral movement (piston slap) as the piston changes direction from up-stroke to down- 
stroke. The greater the force acting on the piston and the greater the running clearance, the greater 
the piston slap. 


31 




N20 Engine 
2. Engine Components 

Pin offset involves advancing the time when the piston changes between the compression and power 
stroke to the lower pressure range before top dead center. This results in a reduction of noise and fric¬ 
tion. 

Pin offset refers to the displacement of the wrist pin axis from the cylinder center line of the piston. 

A positive offset indicates offset to the major thrust face, a negative offset denotes offset to the mi¬ 
nor thrust face. The major thrust face refers to that side of the piston on which the piston rests in the 
combustion stroke on its way to bottom dead center(see arrow of III). Minor thrust is the piston's thrust 
against the opposite cylinder wall during the compression stroke (see arrow of I). 

The following graphic shows a conventional crankshaft drive without pin and crankshaft offset.

Thrust force 


As the graphic shows, in a conventional crankshaft drive assembly the wrist pin boss, the connecting 
rod and the center of crankshaft rotation are in line at top dead center (TDC). Because of this arrange¬ 
ment, the piston is forced against the minor thrust face (B) during the up-stroke. At TDC the forces are 
compensated because the pressure on the minor thrust face decreases as the crankshaft rotates away 
from TDC and the piston tilts towards the major thrust face (A). Because there is already high pressure 
at TDC, this abrupt change of face causes a noise which is referred to as piston slap. 

Pin offset can be effected towards the major thrust face (positive) and also towards the minor thrust 
side (negative). Major-thrust-face pin offset is also referred to as noise offset. 

Minor-thrust-face pin offset is also referred to as thermal offset. In this position the sealing effect of 
the piston rings is improved.

Because the noise can be heard during the change of faces, technical measures are used to shift this 
change of faces as far as possible to a range (piston position) in which the acting forces are lower. This 
is done in current BMW engines by offsetting the wrist pin towards the major thrust face. 


The offset is about. 0.3 - 0.8 mm in conventional engines and is therefore virtually imperceptible to the 
eye. This is also the reason why the pistons have a directional marking at the top. Incorrect installation 
may result in extreme noise similar to that generated by piston damage.

Thrust force 


The piston rests against the minor thrust face during the up-stroke. A neutral piston position is already 
achieved before TDC by offsetting the wrist pin. This is the case when the center lines of the cylinder 
and of the big and small connecting rod eyes are parallel to each other. Already before TDC the pis¬ 
ton changes from the minor thrust face to the major thrust face. In this phase the force on the piston 
is still low. Due to the off-center support of the piston, the force acting on the piston from above has a 
higher lever arm on the one face than on the other. In this way, the piston is already tilted during the up¬ 
stroke, resulting in contact with the major thrust face at the upper edge. In its subsequent movement 
the piston again travels straight ahead, so that the piston rests completely on the major thrust face. 

The change of faces is much quieter than in a conventional crankshaft drive. 

The downside of pin offset is that there is a slight increase in friction on the major thrust face. This mi¬ 
nor downside, however, is made up for by the reduced noise. 

Crankshaft offset 

A crankcase with crankshaft offset is used for the first time by BMW. 

Crankshaft offset denotes the offset of the crankshaft axis from the cylinder center line. This offset can 
effect on both the major thrust face and the minor thrust face. A positive offset denotes offset to the 
major thrust face, a negative offset denotes offset to the minor thrust face. 

Crankshaft offset can basically be effected in both directions, but up to now only the variation in the 
positive direction (A) has been used.

The following graphic clearly shows that positive crankshaft offset, when compared with positive pin 
offset, has an opposed effect on piston rocking. Thus piston rocking occurs much later and in the 
range of a high cylinder pressure.

A combination of positive crankshaft offset and negative pin offset is used in the N20 engine. 

Both negative and positive pin offset affect the piston rocking behavior. In response to the distribution 
of forces during piston rocking, this occurs later and more quietly.

Advantages 

In an engine with crankshaft offset, the connecting rod in the power cycle is in a roughly perpendicu¬ 
lar position (following graphic, right side) in contrast to an engine without crankshaft offset (following 
graphic, left side). This measure significantly reduces the thrust force (5) and the friction of the piston 
on the cylinder wall which result is increased efficiency. The crankshaft offset in the N20 engine is thus 
considered one more BMW EfficientDynamics measure.

2.2.2. Connecting rod 

Connecting rod 

The connecting rod of the N20 engine has an inside diameter of 144.35 mm. A new feature is the spe¬ 
cially formed hole in the small end of the connecting rod. This formed hole is machined wider on the 
lower edges of the wrist pin bushing/bore. This design evenly distributes the force acting on the wrist 
pin over the entire surface of the rod bushing and reduces the load at the edges, as the piston is forced 
downward on the power stroke. 


42

2.2.3. Piston with piston rings 

A full slipper skirt piston manufactured by the company FM is used. The piston diameter is 84 mm. 
The first piston ring is a steel-nitrided plain compression ring. The second piston ring is a stepped 
compression ring. The oil scraper ring is a steel band ring with a spring, which is also known as an MF 
system ring. 

As previously discussed the wrist pin axis has a negative offset to the minor thrust face. 

An installation position arrow is featured on the piston. This arrow always points on installation in the 
engine longitudinal direction facing the timing chain. It is necessary to install the piston in the correct 
position, since asymmetric valve reliefs and different strengths on the intake and exhaust sides will re¬ 
sult in valve and cylinder wall damage.

2.3. Camshaft drive 

The camshaft drive design is similar to previous engines. The oil pump is gear driven via the coun¬ 
terbalance shafts. To ensure that the counterbalance shafts are correctly positioned in relation to the 
crankshaft, a secondary chain drive is used which is also equipped with a chain tensioner. The sec¬ 
ondary chain is a tooth-type chain.

2.4. Counterbalance shafts 

The purpose of the counterbalance shafts is to improve the engine's smooth running and acoustic 
performance. This is achieved using two counter-rotating shafts which are fitted with balance weights. 

The counterbalance shafts are driven by the crankshaft via a tooth-type chain. The tooth-type chain 
requires the use of special gears on the crankshaft and the counterbalance shafts. The tooth-type 
chain optimizes the rolling of the drive chain on the sprockets, thereby reducing noise.

Counterbalance shaft sprocket 


Before removing and installing the counterbalance drive sprocket the lower counterbalance shaft must 
be secured with a 4.5 mm thick alignment pin, special tool #2212 825 to securely position the coun¬ 
terbalance shafts with the crankshaft. A seal plug which is inserted in the locating hole must be re¬ 
moved for this purpose. This seal plug prevents oil from flowing into the counterbalance shaft chamber 
during operation, a situation which would cause oil foaming. It is thus imperative that this seal plug be 
re installed during final assembly. The excess oil in the chamber is carried along by the rotation of the 
balance weights and returned via a discharge opening to the oil sump.

Intake and exhaust valves 

The intake and exhaust valves are carry-over parts from the N55 engine. The intake valve has a stem 
diameter of 5 mm. The exhaust valve has a stem diameter of 6 mm, because it is hollow and sodium 
filled. The exhaust valve seats are made from hardened material and the intake valve seats are induc¬ 
tion-hardened. 

Valve springs 

The valve springs used for the intake and exhaust valves are different. The intake valve springs have al¬ 
ready been used in the N52, N52TU and N55 engines. The exhaust valve springs are familiar from the 
N51, N52, N52TU, N54 and N55 engines. 

2.5.2. Valvetronic 

A_ 

The Valvetronic comprises fully variable valve lift control and variable camshaft control (double 
VANOS), which makes the closing time of the intake valve freely adjustable. 

Valve lift control is performed on the intake side, while camshaft control is performed on both the in¬ 
take and exhaust sides. 

Throttle-free load control is only possible if: 

• the lift of the intake valve 

• and camshaft adjustment of the intake and exhaust camshafts are variably controllable. 


Result: 

The opening and closing times and thus the opening period and the lift of the intake valve are freely 
adjustable. 


VANOS 

The VANOS system has been modified. This modification now provides for even faster VANOS unit 
setting speeds. The modification has also further reduced system failure. The following comparison of 
the VANOS systems of N55 and N20 engines shows that fewer oil passages are necessary.

The locking pin ensures that the VANOS unit is locked in a set position when in the depressurized 
state. The spiral or torsion spring (not shown here) is designed to compensate the middle camshaft 
friction, because without the spring the VANOS adjusts much faster to “retarded” (with friction) than 
to “advanced” (against friction). The locking effect is provided by the oil pressure, which when the ac-

tuator is nonregistered always forces the VANOS unit into the locking position (where the locking pin 
engages and blocks the VANOS unit). The timing can be adjusted in this way. This is important when 
the engine is started to ensure exact timing. The locking pin is simultaneously supplied with the oil 
pressure available for timing advance via oil passages in the VANOS unit. If the camshaft is to be “ad¬ 
vanced”, the locking pin is then forced by the applied oil pressure against the locking spring towards 
the cartridge and the locking cover is released for VANOS adjustment.

VANOS central valve 


The VANOS unit is secured to the camshaft by the VANOS central valve. The oil flow into the VANOS 
unit is simultaneously controlled by this VANOS central valve. The system is actuated by a solenoid 
actuator (which presses its own plunger against the plunger (4) of the VANOS central valve) thereby 
switching this valve. 

The oil flow is controlled by means of the plunger. In the illustration below the plunger is shown ex¬ 
tended. The large graphic shows the flow of oil from the main oil passage into the VANOS unit, while 
the small graphic shows the flow of oil from the VANOS unit into the cylinder head.

The system uses Valvetronic III, which is already used in the N55 engine.

3. Oil Supply 

The oil supply in the N20 engine is very similar to that in the N55 engine. There are only a few changes 
to the design and some differing details. Due to the complexity of this system, it will be discussed 
again in greater detail here. 

The special features of the oil supply in the N20 engine are: 

• Map-controlled oil pump 

• New pendulum-slide oil pump 

• New VANOS valves 

• Chain tensioner for counterbalance shaft and oil pump drive 

• Raw oil cooling 

• New combined oil pressure and temperature sensor.

3.2. Oil pump and pressure control 

A variable-volumetric-flow sliding block oil pump is also used in the N20 engine. Despite its shape be¬ 
ing modified, its function is familiar to that of the N63 and N55 engines. Although these two engines 
share a similar oil pump, they differ in how they are controlled. While the oil pump in the N63 engine is 
volumetric-flow-controlled, in the N55 and N20 engines its map-controlled. 


3.2.1. Oil pump 

The oil pump is connected to the counterbalance shaft housing. The oil pump is located at the fly¬ 
wheel side of the engine, but is driven at the front of the engine by the crankshaft via a chain. The 
chain sprocket connects to the oil pump via a long shaft. This shaft forms part of the first counterbal¬ 
ance shaft which rotates in the same direction as the crankshaft. The rotational speed is stepped down 
from the counterbalance shaft for the oil pump via a pair of gears.

As already mentioned, the function of the slide oil pump has not changed. The main difference is that

As in all newer generation slide oil pumps the oil acts directly on the slide mechanism. The higher the 
pressure here, the more the sliding block is forced against the spring in the direction of the center of 
the pump, which reduces the volumetric displacement. This reduces the pump delivery rate and lim-

its the pressure in the system. In this way, it is possible to achieve purely hydraulic/mechanical control 
of the volumetric flow, allowing sufficient operating pressure to be set. This pressure is determined by 
the strength of the main spring in the oil pump which acts on the sliding block. 

As with the N55 the N20 engine features a map control valve which the DME activates to influence the 
pump delivery rate. 

The oil pump cannot be replaced separately. The entire unit including the counterbalance shafts must 
be replaced if the oil pump fails. 

3.2.2. Control 

Controlling the delivery rate of the oil supply pump is crucial component of the BMW EfficientDynam- 
ics strategy. Essentially, engineers attempt to design a pump with regard to its power input as small as 
possible in order to keep engine losses as low as possible. On the other hand, the pump must also be 
designed in such a way as to deliver sufficient volume and pressure under all operating conditions. A 
conventional, non-variable pump would therefore have to be designed in accordance with the second 
standpoint, i.e. large enough to be able to deliver sufficient amounts of oil at all times. However, this 
means that the pump may deliver far too much oil volume and pressure over a large portion of its ser¬ 
vice life and thereby draw more energy than necessary from the powertrain. For this reason, more and 
more pumps are now variable in design and their control is becoming increasingly more fine-tuned. 
Thus the conventional pump was followed by volumetric flow control, which was subsequently extend¬ 
ed to included map control. 

Volumetric flow control 

The N20 uses a vane type oil pump. The core of this variable-volumetric-flow oil pump is the sliding 
mechanism. It can be displaced with respect to the pump shaft to vary the pump's delivery rate.

Sliding block

Suction side 


In the maximum delivery setting the sliding block is positioned off-center with respect to the pump 
shaft. In this way, an increase in volume occurs on the suction side and correspondingly a decrease in 
volume occurs on the pressure side. This generates high pump capacity. 

When the sliding block is displaced towards the pump shaft, the pump volume is reduced. Therefore, 
the pump capacity is reduced until finally the minimum delivery is reached. 

The position of the sliding block is dependent on the oil pressure in the pump's control oil chamber. 
This pressure pushes on the sliding block against the force of a spring. When the pressure is low in the 
control chamber, the sliding block is off-center and the delivery rate is high. When the pressure is high 
in the control chamber, the sliding block is displaced towards the center of the pump and the delivery 
rate decreases. 

With pure volumetric flow control, the pressure in the control oil chamber corresponds to that in the 
main oil passage. In this way, it is possible to maintain a relatively uniform pressure irrespective of the 
necessary volumetric flow. One reason for large differences in the necessary volumetric flow in the oil 
circuit is the VANOS variable camshaft timing control system. In the VANOS units the oil is used not 
only for lubrication purposes but also for hydraulic actuation of the cams. A large oil volume is thus 
necessary during the adjustment phase, which causes the pressure in the system to drop. The falling 
pressure causes the sliding block in the oil pump to be displaced in the direction of higher delivery. In 
this way, a higher volumetric flow is made available and the pressure drop is compensated for. 

As already mentioned, the pressure that is set in the oil system is dependent on the force of the spring 
which counteracts the pressure in the control oil chamber. With a softer spring, the sliding block can 
be displaced more easily, i.e. with a lower pressure, towards the center. With a harder spring, more 
pressure is required to reduce the volumetric displacement of the pump. Thus the appropriate spring 
was calculated and selected to properly operate the N20 oil system. 

Map control represents a further fine-tuning of volumetric flow control. 

Map control 

Map control is used to influence the pressure in the control oil chamber of the pump. Two valves are 
involved in this process, a solenoid valve called the map control valve and a hydraulic valve which al¬ 
so acts as a fail-safe. This “fail safe” valve is referred to as an emergency valve or a second-level mode 
control valve. 

The map control valve is located on the left side of the engine (bolted to bedplate) and channels the oil 
pressure from the main oil passage to the control oil chamber within the pump. Its purpose is to influ¬ 
ence pump volume output by gradually and smoothly reducing the oil pressure in the control oil cham¬ 
ber. 


75 






N20 Engine 

3. Oil Supply 



Map control valve 

The further it reduces the pressure, the more volume is delivered by the oil pump as the sliding block 
moves further off center. However, this mode does not produce a positive effect on energy saving. 
Therefore the main spring in the oil pump which acts on the sliding block is softer than the one used 
in a purely volumetric-flow-controlled system. In other words, the sliding block can be moved to a cen¬ 
tred position very easily, as the pump switches to minimum delivery. In this way, there are lower pres¬ 
sure conditions in the oil system, which in turn translates into less energy spent to drive the oil pump. 
Where necessary, the pressure in the control oil chamber can now be reduced by the map control valve 
which also reduces the delivery rate. 

The second stage of map control is a hydraulic valve which is located in the oil pump housing. This 
valve is also referred to as an emergency valve.

This is 3/2-way valve is used to channel the main oil pressure into the oil pump's control oil chamber. 
The oil from the main oil passage forces a plunger back against a spring until the passage to the oil 
pump control chamber is opened. The oil pressure from the map control valve acts on the other end of 
the plunger. The pressure in the map control valve port counter acts the main oil passage pressure to 
fine tune the oil pressure within the oil pump's volume control chamber which in turn varies the oil de¬ 
livery rate of the pump.

In map control mode oil pressure acts on both ends of the plunger. The oil pressure directly from the 
main oil passage acts against the emergency valve spring. At the same time the oil pressure released 
by the map control valve acts on the other end, i.e. along with the emergency valve spring. 



N20 engine, hydraulic 3/2-way valve with map control 

The plunger remains constantly in its end position during map control. To displace the plunger, there 
would have to be a pressure of 5.5 bar in the main oil port to counter act the spring. This never arises 
in map control mode, since the maximum set pressure in the system is 4.5 bar in the circuit. In this set¬ 
ting the emergency valve forms a connection between the map control valve and the oil pump's con¬ 
trol oil chamber (the valve is closed to the main oil duct). 



N20 engine, simplified oil circuit with map control 


The pump delivery rate is controlled by the pressure in the pump's control oil chamber which in turn is 
determined directly by the DME via the map control valve. 

Map control is the oil system's standard operating mode. It is always engaged when there are no faults 
in the system and the operating conditions do not exceed or drop below certain values (see below). 

Up to now map control system would manage without the emergency valve. This is however a second 
stage of map control - a kind of fail safe mode. 


79

If the map control valve is deactivated, the chamber at the end of the spring in the emergency valve 
is depressurized. Because the plunger is now only being held by the spring the main oil pressure dis¬ 
places it and makes its way into the pump's control chamber. A pressure difference of 5.5 bar is re¬ 
quired to switch the emergency valve into this position. 



N20 engine, emergency valve with “second-level control” 


In this mode the pressure is channelled from the main oil passage directly into the oil pump's control 
oil chamber. 



N20 engine, simplified oil circuit in emergency mode 

There is no control in emergency mode because the oil pressure is limited to max. 5.5 bar and there is 
no oil is admitted into the oil pump's control oil chamber below this level. 

The map control valve is closed at zero current. Therefore, should the map control valve fail, the sys¬ 
tem is automatically in emergency mode, guaranteeing pressure limitation to 5.5 bar. As already men¬ 
tioned, map control mode is the normal mode. There are, however, several reasons why the DME will 
switch to emergency mode. 

Emergency mode is applied in the following conditions: 

• Map control valve faulty 

• Oil pressure sensor faulty 

• Outside temperature less than - 20 °C/- 4 °F 

• High engine oil or coolant temperature 

• Driving profile (e.g. high engine revs for a long time)

3. Oil Supply 


The oil pressure sensor signal allows the DME to identify whether the emergency valve is stuck. If this 
is the case, the DME attempts to free the emergency valve by applying a varying pressure build-up. If 
the emergency valve is stuck in the “closed” position, it is possible to continue map control. If, howev¬ 
er, the emergency valve is stuck in the “open” position, a sufficient pressure build-up is no longer pos¬ 
sible. The oil pressure indicator light is activated and the engine must be shut down immediately. 


Summary 


By applying oil pump map control, it is possible to deliver an oil supply to match demand and to reduce 
the average pressure level in the oil circuit. This ensures that the oil pump has a lower energy require¬ 
ment. 

The map control valve controls the pressure in the system and in turn allows the delivery rate to be 
controlled by the DME. 

The following diagram shows (in simplified form) the pressure curves plotted against engine speed for 
different oil pumps.

The diagram illustrates the advantage of controlled oil pumps. When a sufficient oil pressure is 
reached, the delivery rate of the oil pump can be reduced. Lower pressure is synonymous with fu¬ 
el saving. Thus the map-controlled oil pump offers the greatest advantage here, since it can be con¬ 
trolled regardless of engine speed. At partial load, for example, only lower pressures are required, be¬ 
cause the crankshaft main bearings have to bear less load. Accordingly, a lower oil pressure can be set 
in the partial load range, which illustrates even more clearly the advantage over the volumetric-flow- 
controlled oil pump. 

The oil pressure in map mode ranges between 1.5 and 4.5 bar. 

The emergency valve has been integrated in the system as a fail safe and to facilitate a higher pressure 
in certain conditions. For example if the map control valve fails, it ensures the necessary pressure is 
built up and the oil pump pressure control at 5.5 bar. 

3.2.3. Pressure-limiting valve 

Additionally available to control the oil pump is a pressure-limiting valve, which is often also known as a 
cold-start valve.

3. Oil Supply 

The pressure-limiting valve is located in the oil pump housing and in the oil circuit as the first compo¬ 
nent after the pump. It opens at a pressure of roughly 12 to 13 bar and discharges the oil directly into 
the oil sump. It is necessary at low temperatures and when the oil has a higher viscosity. In these situ¬ 
ations the pressure-limiting valve prevents damage to components, in particular to the oil filter module 
and its seals. This is relevant at temperatures of below -20 °C / -4 °F, since map control is already ac¬ 
tive above this temperature. 


3.3. Oil filtering and cooling 

The N20 engine has a similar plastic oil filter housing as the N55 engine, to which the engine oil-to- 
coolant heat exchanger is also directly mounted. This entire unit is known as the oil filter module.

3.3.1. Oil cooling 

In the N20 engine the engine oil-to-coolant heat exchanger is located in the oil circuit ahead of the 
oil filter. This is known as raw oil cooling, in contrast to clean oil cooling. This is due to the lead-free 
crankshaft and connecting rod bearings. Because these components are extremely sensitive to dirt 
particles, this arrangement brings the oil filter even closer to just before the bearing positions. The im¬ 
portance is even greater should auxiliary engine oil coolers be used in later models, as here there is al¬ 
ways the risk of dirt getting into the oil circuit after an accident. 

Permanent bypass 

The N20 engine does not have a heat exchanger bypass valve. Instead, like the N55 engine, it has a 
so-called permanent bypass. This is a permanently open bypass around the engine oil-to-coolant heat 
exchanger. The bypass incorporates a flow restrictor to ensure that the majority of the oil flows through 
the engine oil-to-coolant heat exchanger.

3.3.2. Oil filtering 

The full-flow oil filter used in the N20 engine. Instead of a non-return valve, a non-return diaphragm is 
mounted directly on the filter element. The function of this diaphragm is to prevent the oil filter from 
draining after the engine is shut down.

Index 

Explanation

Oil filter

Non-return diaphragm 


The non-return diaphragm is made of rubber and is raised by the oil pressure to admit oil into the fil¬ 
ter. When the engine is shut down and the oil pressure drops, the non-return diaphragm uses its shape 
and elasticity to seal off the oil duct. The engine oil is unable to flow out of the filter. The non-return di¬ 
aphragm is part of the oil filter and is therefore automatically replaced each time the filter is changed. 

The N20 engine has a filter bypass valve which can open a bypass around the filter if, for example, the 
engine oil is cold and has a higher viscosity. This occurs if the pressure difference between before and 
after the filter exceeds about. 2.5 bar. The permissible pressure difference has been increased from 
2.0 to 2.5 bar in order to protect the lead-free crankshaft and connecting rod bearings. This ensures 
that the filter is bypassed much less frequently and any dirt particles are reliably filtered out.

3.4. Oil monitoring 

3.4.1. Oil pressure and temperature sensor 


N20 engine, oil pressure and temperature sensor 

A new combined oil pressure and temperature sensor is used. The pressure signal is required for oil 
pump map control, the temperature signal for engine heat management. 

The sensor is exposed in the main oil passage to the oil pressure prevailing there and the oil tempera¬ 
ture. Thus, what is measured is no longer the oil temperature in the oil sump, but instead the actual oil 
temperature in the engine. 

Combined pressure and temperature sensors usually have four connections (power supply, ground, 
temperature signal, pressure signal). The oil pressure and temperature sensor has only three connec¬ 
tions. The temperature and pressure signals are not transmitted on separate wires. Instead, the sensor 
outputs a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) signal. This PWM signal is split into three fixed cycles. The 
first cycle is for synchronization and diagnosis, the second transmits the temperature, and the third the 
pressure. The duration of the “high level” of a respective cycle determines the value.

For the temperature signal: 

• 128 ps (3.125 % pulse width) = -40 °C/-40 °F 

• 3968 ps (96.875 % pulse width) = 160 °C/320 °F 

For the pressure signal: 

• 128 ps (3.125 % pulse width) = 0.5 bar (absolute) 

• 3968 ps (96.875 % pulse width) = 10.5 bar (absolute) 

The times indicated are nominal values. Actually the durations of each cycle and of the respective high 
level are measure and compared with each other. The resulting pulse width produces the respective 
measured value. 

The actual oil pressure can be measured by installing special tool # 2 212 823. Please refer to the re¬ 
pair instructions. 

3.4.2. Oil level monitoring 

The established thermal oil level sensor is used to monitor the oil level and the oil temperature. 


3.5. Oil spray nozzles 

As with previous BMW engines those components which cannot be reached directly by an oil passage 
are lubricated and/or cooled by oil spray nozzles. 

3.5.1. Piston crown cooling 

The oil spray nozzles for piston crown cooling are used in the N20 engine. They incorporate a non-re¬ 
turn valve to enable them to open and close only from a specific oil pressure. 

As well as cooling the piston crowns, they are also responsible for lubricating the wrist pins, which is 
why it is very important for them to be precisely aligned.

The oil spray nozzles for piston crown cooling in the N20 engine must be correctly positioned using a

There are two different variants of oil spray nozzle for piston crown cooling for the N20 engine, de¬ 
pending on their arrangement in the engine. One variant for cylinders 1 and 3 and one variant for cylin¬ 
ders 2 and 4. 


3.5.2. Chain drive 

The chain drive in the N20 engine is divided into an upper section (the camshaft drive) and a lower 
section (the oil pump drive). 

Camshaft drive 

The timing chain is lubricated by an oil spray nozzle located in the chain tensioner. There is an opening 
in the tensioning rail through which the oil can be sprayed for this purpose.

Oil is sprayed onto the chain through the chain tensioner for the counterbalance shaft and oil pump 
drive. This is however not necessary for lubrication, since the chain is immersed in the oil sump. In this 
case, this helps the oil to drain from the chain tensioner. 

3.5.3. Camshaft 

The lobes on the camshaft are also lubricated via oil spray nozzles. For the intake camshaft there are 
fine grooves in the gates which are supplied with oil from the screw hole.

When fitting the guide block it is essential to work in absolutely clean conditions, as any soiling could 
block the oil spray nozzles. Lubrication of the cam lobes would no longer be guaranteed and could re¬ 
sult in damage to the valvetrain. 


For the exhaust camshaft, the cylinder head features an oil pipe which sprays oil through small holes 
directly onto the cam lobes. Accordingly, there are eight holes for lubricating the exhaust valve lobes 
and an extra hole for lubricating the triple cam which drives the high-pressure fuel pump.

nozzle. This nozzle must be correctly aligned when fitted. However, this does not require the use of a 
special tool. Instead the nozzle has to be carefully and noticeably engaged in the designated guide on 
the Valvetronic servomotor.

4. Cooling 

The cooling system is very similar to the N55 engine. In the N20 engine an engine oil-to-coolant heat 
exchanger is used to cool the engine oil. The cooling system is controlled (e.g. electric coolant pump, 
map thermostat and electric fan) by the heat management coordinator in the DME.

4.2. Heat management 

The N20 engine has the same heat management functions in the DME, as the N55. This allows inde¬ 
pendent control of the electric cooling components of electric fan, map thermostat and coolant pump. 

4.2.1. Coolant pump 

The N20 engine has an electric coolant pump, as is the case with many BMW engines. Its nominal 
power consumption is 400 W. 



N20 engine, coolant pump 


A_ 

If the coolant pump is removed but is to be reused, it is important to ensure that it is set down still filled 
with coolant. Drying out may cause the bearings to stick. Not following this procedure can possibly 
cause the coolant pump not start, which in turn may result in damage to the engine. 

Before installing, turn the pump impeller manually to ensure that it moves freely.

4.2.2. Map thermostat 

The N20 engine is fitted with a conventional map thermostat which has the following technical data in 
non-electrically controlled mode: 


Setting of map thermostat 

Coolant temperature 

Starts to open 

97 ±2 °C / 206 ±2 °F 

Fully open 

109 °C / 228 ±2 °F 


In addition, an electric heater in the map thermostat can be used to make the thermostat open at a 
lower coolant temperature. 

4.2.3. Heat management function 

The heat management determines the current cooling requirement and controls the cooling system 
accordingly. Under certain circumstances the coolant pump can even be shut down entirely, for exam¬ 
ple in order to heat the coolant more quickly in the warm-up phase. The coolant pump continues to 
deliver when the engine is stopped and very hot or to cool the exhaust turbochargers. The cooling out¬ 
put can therefore be requested independently of the engine speed. The heat management is able in 
addition to the map thermostat to activate the coolant pump using different program maps. The en¬ 
gine management is thus able to adapt the coolant temperature to the driving situation. 

The following temperature ranges are adjusted by the engine management: 

• 109 °C / 228 ±2 °F= Economy operation 

• 106 °C / 222 ±2 °F= Normal operation 

• 95 °C / 203 ±2 °F= High operation 

• 80 °C /176 ±2 °F= High operation and current supply to the map thermostat. 

If the engine control unit identifies the ’’Economy” operating range on the basis of running perfor¬ 
mance, the engine management adjusts to a higher temperature (109 °C / 228 °F). In this temperature 
range the engine is to be operated with a relatively low fuel requirement. Internal engine friction is re¬ 
duced at higher temperature. The temperature increase therefore favors the lower fuel consumption in 
the low load range. In ’’High and current supply to the map thermostat” operation the driver would like 
to utilize the engine's optimum power development. The temperature in the cylinder head is reduced 
to 80 °C /176 °F for this purpose. This reduction improves volumetric efficiency, which results in an 
engine torque increase. The engine control unit can now, adapted to the relevant driving situation, ad¬ 
just a specific operating range. It is therefore possible to influence consumption and power output via 
the cooling system. 

System protection 

If the coolant or engine oil is subject to excessive temperatures during engine operation, certain func¬ 
tions in the vehicle are influenced in such a way that more energy is made available for engine cooling. 

The measures are split into two operating modes: 

• Component protection

4.3. Internal engine cooling 

As in the N55 engine, the coolant passages in the cylinder head also surround the injectors, which are 
cooled in this way. 

Unlike the N55 engine, the N20 engine has no grooves on the block deck between the cylinders. In¬ 
stead, the N20 engine has bore holes between the cylinders, two on each side, which meet in the mid¬ 
dle.

5.2.1. Hot-film air mass meter 

The N20 engine is equipped with a hot-film air mass meter, which is very similar to that in the N74 en¬ 
gine. 

It can generally be said that the quality of air mass determination by measurement using a hot-film air 
mass meter and by calculation of the substitute value (of intake air temperature, charging pressure, en¬ 
gine speed, etc.) is to be considered as equal in the current state of development. The calculated sub¬ 
stitute value is nevertheless used for engine load control. This value is however regularly adjusted with 
the value of the hot-film air mass meter in order to compensate for tolerances which arise on account 
of the complex flow mechanics conditions in the air intake system. The more sophisticated the mix¬ 
ture preparation method (Valvetronic, High Precision Injection (especially in conjunction with stratified 
charge mode), TVDI), the more important it is to adjust the substitute value with the hot-film air mass 
meter. TVDI is currently the most sophisticated mixture preparation method. For this reason, all TVDI 
engines are also equipped with a hot-film air mass meter. 

The use of a hot-film air mass meter also offers the opportunity of extended diagnoses, e.g. for tank or 
crankcase ventilation, as these systems create a deviation in the air mass. 

A 

Failure or disconnection of the hot-film air mass meter does not immediately result in emergency en¬ 
gine operation. However, impaired mixture preparation and therefore poorer emission values are possi¬ 
ble, which is why the emissions warning lamp lights up. 


5.2.2. Intake manifold 

As in the N55 engine, the Digital Engine Electronics (DME) is mounted on the intake manifold. Howev¬ 
er, there are differences. First, the DME is located on the intake manifold and not under it. Second, the 
intake manifold is not open after the DME is removed. Located between the intake manifold and the 
DME is a metal plate which conducts heat away from the DME this plate is cooled by the intake ports 
of the intake manifold.

Located directly behind the throttle valve, at the entry to the intake manifold, is the intake manifold 
pressure sensor. On closer inspection, it can be seen to be a combined pressure and temperature sen¬ 
sor. The temperature signal is therefore not read out. The reason for using this sensor lies in the con¬ 
cept of common parts. It is better to use the same sensor which is also used as the charge air temper¬ 
ature and pressure sensor and simply not to read out the temperature signal than to introduce a sepa¬ 
rate sensor. 


5.3. Exhaust turbocharger 

The N20 engine features an exhaust turbocharger with TwinScroll technology. It includes at the tur¬ 
bine inlet two separate ports in which the exhaust gas is routed from two cylinders to the turbine 
vanes.

The turbocharger has a familiar design with an electric blow-off valve and a vacuum-controlled waste- 
gate valve. 

5.3.1. Function of TwinScroll exhaust turbocharger 

The designation TwinScroll denotes an exhaust turbocharger with a twin-scroll turbine housing. In this 
way, the exhaust gas from two cylinders in each case is routed separately to the turbine. In the N20 en¬ 
gine (as is usual in 4-cylinder engines) cylinders 1 and 4 and cylinders 2 and 3 are brought together. In 
this way, so-called pulse charging is used to greater effect. 

Pressure and pulse charging 

Two principles of forced induction are used in engines with exhaust turbochargers - pressure and 
pulse charging. Pressure charging means that the pressure ahead of the turbine is approximately con¬ 
stant. The energy which drives the exhaust turbocharger is obtained from the pressure difference be¬ 
fore and after the turbine. 

In the case of pulse charging, the pressure before the turbine is high-speed and greatly fluctuating, or 
pulsating by the discharge of the exhaust gas from the combustion chamber. The pressure increase 
results in a pressure wave which strikes the turbine. In this case, the kinetic energy of the exhaust gas 
is used, whereby the pressure waves drive the turbocharger. 

Pulse charging provides for a fast response by the turbocharger, especially at low speeds, because 
pulsation is at its strongest here, whereas in the case of pressure charging the pressure difference be¬ 
tween before and after the turbine is still low. 

In actual fact, both priciples are always used in exhaust turbochargers in passenger car engines. The 
proportion of pulse charging is higher or lower, depending on the size factors, the exhaust port guides 
and the number of cylinders. 

Dependence on the number of cylinders 

In a single-cylinder engine there is an exhaust cycle every two revolutions of the crankshaft. Theoreti¬ 
cally, exhaust gas is therefore discharged for 180° every 720° crank angle. The graphic below shows in 
highly simplified form the pressure conditions before the exhaust turbocharger in a single-cylinder 
engine.

As can be seen here, every 720° CA there is a pressure wave which strikes the turbine. This pulse ac¬ 
celerates the turbine. 

The next graphic shows the pressure conditions before the turbine in a 4-cylinder engine.

Because each cylinder had its exhaust cycle after two full crankshaft revolutions, there are four pres¬ 
sure waves within the 720° CA. Because of the firing interval, they are distributed evenly at an interval 
of 180° CA. The pressure waves are superimposed here. While the pressure of one cylinder decreas¬ 
es, the pressure of the next cylinder is already increasing. 

This produces a superimposed pressure before the turbine, as the next graphic shows.

Because of the superimposition, the pressure difference from minimum to maximum is clearly lower. In 
this way, the pulse by the pressure wave on the turbine also decreases. In this cases, the proportion of 
pulse supercharging in the exhaust turbocharger is lower. 

One way of preventing this in a 4-cylinder engine is the TwinScroll exhaust turbocharger. By splitting 
the four cylinders into two ports, the pressure conditions of a 2-cylinder engine are depicted in the two 
ports in each case, as the following graphic shows.

Here too the pressures of the two cylinders are superimposed. However, cylinders 1 and 4 and 2 and 3 
are combined in the two ports. Because of the firing order of a 4-cylinder engine, there is in each case 
an interval of 360° CA between the exhaust cycles of a port. Thus, in spite of this superimposition, 
there is a large pressure difference and the kinetic energy of the exhaust gas can be better utilized. 

A specially shaped exhaust manifold is used to combine the exhaust pipes from cylinders 1 and 4 and 
2 and 3. 

In the turbocharger these two ports run on separately from each other up to the turbine. The Twin- 
Scroll exhaust turbocharger differs from a conventional exhaust turbocharger in that the turbine hous¬ 
ing separates in two forming a ring channel around the turbine.

The exhaust manifold is identical in design to that of the N55 engine. It is air-gap-insulated and welded 
to the turbocharger. The exhaust manifold in the N20 engine is a four-into-two type, which is neces¬ 
sary for the special function of the TwinScroll turbocharger. Here the exhaust outlet pipes of cylinders 
1 and 4 and 2 and 3 are combined in each case into one port.

Oxygen sensors 

The Bosch oxygen sensors used are familiar from previous engines: 

• Pre oxygen sensor: LSU ADV 

• Post oxygen sensor: LSF4.2. 

The pre oxygen sensor is located ahead of the primary catalytic converter, as close as possible to the 
turbine outlet. Its position has been chosen so that all the cylinders can be recorded separately. The 
post oxygen sensor is positioned between the first and second ceramic monoliths.

N20 Engine 
6. Vacuum System 

The vacuum system of the N20 engine is comparable with that of the N55 engine. As well as supplying 
the brake servo, it is needed primarily to activate the wastegate valve on the turbocharger. In addition, 
the exhaust flap is actuated by vacuum in the N20 engine.

6. Vacuum System 

The vacuum pump as usual is designed to have two stages so that the majority of the generated vac¬ 
uum is made available to the brake servo. A vacuum reservoir is used to provide sufficient vacuum for 
actuating the wastegate valve. This reservoir is permanently attached to the engine cover. 

A 

Disconnect the vacuum line before removing the engine cover, as otherwise there is a risk of damage.

N20 Engine 
7. Fuel Preparation 

The N20 engine uses high-pressure injection, which was introduced in the N55 engine. It differs from 
high-precision injection (HPI) in that it uses solenoid valve injectors with multi-hole nozzles instead of 
the piezoelectric type. 


7.1. Overview 


The following overview shows the fuel preparation system of the N20 engine. It essentially corre¬ 
sponds to the systems with direct fuel injection familiar in BMW models.

Solenoid valve injector 


Bosch high-pressure fuel injectors with the designation HDEV5.2 are used. The high pressure pump is 
already known from the 8 and 12 cylinder engines. An innovation in the N20 engine is the fact that the 
high-pressure lines from rail to injector are now no longer screwed at the rail end, but welded. Anoth¬ 
er feature when compared with established BMW fuel systems is the omission of the fuel low-pressure 
sensor. 

A_ 

Work on the fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. The coolant tem¬ 
perature must be below 40 °C /104°F, to avoid risk of injury due to spray back from residual 
pressure in the high-pressure fuel system. 

When working on the high-pressure fuel system, it is essential to adhere to conditions of ab¬ 
solute cleanliness and to observe the work sequences described in the repair instructions. 
Even the slightest contamination and damage to the threaded fittings of the high-pressure 
lines can cause leaks. 

When working on the fuel system of the N20 engine, it is important to ensure that the ignition coils 
are not wet with fuel. The resistance of the insulating silicone material is greatly reduced by sustained 
contact with fuel. This may result in arcing on the spark plug connection and thus in misfires. 

• Before making any modifications to the fuel system, remove the ignition coils and protect the 
spark plugs by covering with a cloth 

• Before reinstalling the solenoid valve injectors, remove the ignition coils and ensure that the 
cleanest possible conditions are maintained. 

• Ignition coils heavily saturated by fuel must be replaced. 


7.2. Fuel pump control 

As already mentioned, there is no fuel low-pressure sensor in the N20 engine. The fuel pressure is cal¬ 
culated by monitoring pump speed and load. 


7.3. High-pressure pump 

The Bosch high-pressure pump, familiar from the N63 and N74 is used. This is a single-plunger pump 
which is driven from the exhaust camshaft via a triple lobe on the cam. 


112 









N20 Engine 
7. Fuel Preparation 

For further information on the high-pressure pump, please refer to the N63 and N74 engine training in¬ 
formation available on TIS and ICR 


7.4. Injectors 

The Bosch HDEV5.2 solenoid valve injector is an inward-opening multi-hole valve unlike the out¬ 
ward-opening piezo injector used in HPI engines. The HDEV5.2 is also characterized by high variability 
with regard to spray angle and spray pattern, and is configured for a system pressure of up to 200 bar. 

These injectors are already used in the N55 engine. However, their operating principle is the same as 
that of the injectors used in the N73 engines. 

Note: The N73 HDEV control modules contain pulse width modulated final output stages 
with high performance capacitors to transform the system voltage up to 85 to 100 volts. See 
ST042 E65 Complete Vehicle /N73 engine training material available on TIS and ICP.

A magnetic field is generated when the coil is energized. This magnetic field lifts the nozzle pintle 
against spring pressure off the valve seat and opens the discharge holes of the injector nozzle. The 
high pressure in the rail forces the fuel through discharge holes at high speed into the cylinder. To ter¬ 
minate injection, current is shut off, the nozzle pintle is forced closed by spring force back onto the 
valve seat. 


114 

















































N20 Engine 
7. Fuel Preparation 

The valve opens and closes at very high speed and ensures a constant opening cross-section during 
the opening period. The injected fuel quantity is dependent on the rail pressure, the back pressure in 
the combustion chamber and the opening period of the injector. 

For further information on injector activation, refer to the section entitled Engine Electrical System of 
this training material. 

Unlike the injectors previously used, the solenoid valve injectors of the N55 and N20 engines have 
long and relatively sensitive stems made necessary by the shape of the cylinder head. Each stem is 
made of plastic on the outside but on the inside there is a metal tube serves as a fuel line. 

A 

The stems of the solenoid valve injectors can only withstand 6Nm of torque which translates 
to 2000 N of tensile force. It is essential when removing and installing the injectors to follow 
the specific procedure set out in the repair instructions, along with the use of special tool #0 
496 885 for injector removal. If this tool is not used the injectors will be damaged.

8. Fuel Supply 

The fuel supply is vehicle-specific. Hardly any changes have been made to the already existing mod¬ 
els. Therefore only the tank ventilation system on the engine will be described in greater detail here.

Similar to the N55 

8.1.1. Two-stage tank ventilation 

The two-stage tank venting is used on the N20 engine. This sophisticated system is made necessary 
by the TVDI technology, because in this case sufficient vacuum in the intake manifold is much less 
common. This was introduced with the N55 engine.

However, a suction jet pump is additionally used in view of the fact that sufficient vacuum cannot al¬ 
ways be guaranteed in the clean air pipe. In order to drive this pump, the line to the suction jet pump 
is connected before the throttle valve. This creates a connection between the charge air pipe and the 
clean air pipe. In turbocharged mode the pressure in the charge air pipe is always higher than in the 
clean air pipe, which generates in this line a flow to the clean air pipe.

The line from the tank vent valve is connected to this suction jet pump. The venturi effect ensures that 
the carbon canister is safely purged. 

Non-return valves on both lines from the tank vent valve ensure that there is no return flow into the 
tank vent valve in the event of excess pressure in these lines. 

8.1.2. Two-stage tank ventilation with shutoff valve 

The two stage tank ventilation has a second electrical valve which is very similar in design to the tank 
vent valve. This is known as a shutoff valve.

The shutoff valve serves to diagnose the second point of admission and is designed to close off the

9.2. Engine control unit 

The N20 engine features Digital Engine Electronics from Bosch with the designation MEVD17.2.4. It 
is closely related to the DME of the N55 engine (MEVD17.2) and is also engine-mounted on the intake 
manifold.

Do not attempt trial and error replacement of control units. 

Because of the electronic immobilizer, a trial and error replacement of control units from other 
vehicles must not be attempted under any circumstances. An immobilizer adjustment cannot 
be reversed. 


The N20 engine DME (MEVD17.2.4) is designed to be mounted on the engine's intake manifold on an 
aluminium heatsink plate. The DME is cooled through the heatsink plate by the air flowing through the 
intake manifold. It is important for the DME to be correctly mounted on the heatsink plate (tightening 
torque, good level contact) so as to ensure heat transfer to the plate and thereby cool the DME. 

The connection concept is identical to the MEVD17.2 in the N55 engine. There is a logical division into 
six modules.

9.2.1. Overall function 

The Digital Engine Electronics (DME) is the computing and switching center of the engine manage¬ 
ment system. Sensors on the engine and the vehicle deliver the input signals. The signals for activat¬ 
ing the actuators are calculated from the input signals, the nominal values calculated using a comput¬ 
ing model in the DME control unit and the stored program maps. The DME control unit activates the 
actuators directly or via relays. 

The DME control unit is woken up via the wake-up line (terminal 15 Wake up) by the Car Access Sys¬ 
tem (CAS). 


125 





















N20 Engine 

9. Engine Electrical System 

The after-run starts after terminal 15 OFF. The adaptation values are stored during the after-run. The 
DME control unit uses a bus signal to signal its readiness to “go to sleep”. When all the participating 
control units have signalled their readiness to “go to sleep”, the bus master outputs a bus signal and 
the control units terminate communication five seconds later. 

The printed circuit board in the DME control unit accommodates two sensors: a temperature sen¬ 
sor and an ambient pressure sensor. The temperature sensor is used to monitor the temperature of 
the components in the DME control unit. The ambient pressure is required for calculating the mixture 
composition.
