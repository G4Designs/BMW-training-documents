E83/53/61 Panorama Glass Sunroof 

One of the highlights of the X3 is a fully automatic, two-part panorama glass sunroof with 
an area of almost one square metre. Its front window section can be fully opened while 
both window sections can also be tilted rearward. The panorama glass sunroof affords an 
outstanding view for the rear occupants and, when fully opened, lends the vehicle the 
impression of being almost a Convertible.

Floating Headliner 

The floating headliner consists of two parts con¬ 
trolled by a Bowden Cable. 

The headliner is interlocked to the function of the 
glass roofs. The headliner must be opened 
before the glass sunroof will open. On closing the 
glass sunroof must be closed before the headlin¬ 
er can be closed. 

Glass Covers 

Two glass covers are installed in the panorama 
sunroof. Six. bolts secure the front glass to the 
frame and four bolts secure the rear glass. 

Power Supply and K-Bus Interface 

The MDS acts as the power supply module for 
both the sunroof motor and the headliner motor. 
Communication with the rest of the car is through 
the K-Bus. The MDS receives and transmits K- 
Bus messages.

Wind Deflector 

The wind deflector is cable operated by the rear (headliner) motor. 


System Operation 

Operation of the panorama sunroof is similar to the conventional slide/tilt sunroof. It func¬ 
tions both as a tilting sunroof and a slide/tilt sunroof. The rear glass only tilts, the front 
glass slides and tilts. Rear tilt is possible only when the front glass is also tilted.The 
GM5RD signals the MDS for convenience opening and closing of the panorama glass 
sunroof. 

The panorama glass sunroof is operated as follows: 

• Headliner and glass sunroof Closed. 

• Headliner closed, front and rear glass in tilt position (Headliner goes to vent position). 

• Headliner open, sunroof closed. 

• Headliner open, sunroof opened manually. 

• Headliner open, sunroof opened to comfort position (Via one touch opening). 

• Headliner open, sunroof opened fully (Beyond comfort position).

Floating Headliner 


Opening 

On opening the front part of the headliner 
moves over the rear part of the floating headlin¬ 
er. The special feature of the floating headliner 
is that it can be opened fully without the sun¬ 
roof being open or tilted. 

Vent Mode 

When the panorama glass sunroof is moved 
into the tilt position, the floating headliner is 
moved into the vent position. 

The vent position reduces the suction effect at 
high road speeds. 



Wind Deflector 

The wind deflector is regulated according to road speed. When the sunroof is opened the 
wind deflector remains in the down position until road speed is seen by the MDS. Then 
the wind deflector is placed in the extended position. At roads speeds greater than 
140km/h (84mph) it is retracted to an intermediate position. If the road speed drops 
below 10Okm/h, the wind deflector is again raised.

Initialization 


Initialization must be performed on the panorama glass sunroof anytime the MDS looses 
positioning of the glass panels or the headliner or if the any component of the sunroof 
assembly is replaced. 

The control button is pressed and held in the position to tilt the sunroof. Initialization 
begins approximately 15 seconds after pressing the button. The initialization process may 
take over 2 minutes to perform. 

Note: The control button MUST be held in the tilt position during the entire ini¬ 
tialization process. Failure to hold the button will result in the initializa¬ 
tion procedure to be cancelled. 

During initialization the panorama sunroof will operate as follows: 

• Both sunroof panels enter tilt position(Headliners enter Vent Mode) 

• Both Headliners open 

• Both sunroof panels lower 

• The front sunroof panel opens then closes 

• Both Headliners close 

Anti-Trapping Protection 

Both the covers and the floating headliners are fitted with anti-trap protection. If the MDS 
detects something in the path, the appropriate motor is stopped and activated in the 
reverse direction. 


Service Notes 

The motors may be replaced individually. An initialization procedure is required after 
replacing one or both of the motors 

The MDS control unit my be replaced separately. The panorama glass sunroof must be 
recoded and initialized after MDS replacement.

E91 Panorama Sunroof 

All E91 Sports Wagons sold in the US will be equipped with a panorama sunroof. The 
E91 panorama sunroof is an internally operating slide/tilt sunroof with two glass lids and 
two floating roofliners. 

The glass surface area of the E91 sunroof has increased by 140% when compared with 
the sunroof on the E46 Sports Wagon. This improves the sense of space felt by both the 
front and the rear passengers. 



Panorama Sunroof (E91) 



Single Panel Sunroof (E46/3) 

The E91 panorama sunroof is based on that of the E83 with a slight yet significant 
change. The 50 mm wide ventilation gap on the floating roofliners is at the front and not 
in the middle as on the E83. 

The wind deflector is operated by a mechanism controlled via the floating roofliner motor. 
This wind deflector is controlled as a function of vehicle speed. 

In this way, both lower-frequency drumming (at approx. 70 km/h) and higher-frequency 
whistling (above 120 km/h) are suppressed. 

This is achieved by the net wind deflector, which adopts different heights and therefore 
counteracts the interference noise.

Individual Components of Panorama Sunroof

Panorama Sunroof 



Glass Panels / Roofliners 

Both glass lids can be removed from the E91 panorama sunroof. The retaining screws 
must also be released if the lids are adjusted. 

The two floating roofliners can then also be removed. When the panorama sunroof casing 
is installed, the two electric motors and the wind deflector can still be installed and 
removed. 

Motors 

The panorama sunroof uses two motors for operation. One motor is used solely for the 
operation of the glass panels and the other controls the roofliners and wind deflector. 

The motors are identical and thus can be interchanged for diagnostic purposes but 
should always be left in their original position. This is due to the wear pattern on the 
motor drive to the bowden/screw cable that drives the sunroof components. 

Each motor contains two Hall sensors offset by 90 degrees with respect to each other. 

Tis enables the MDS control unit to accurately detect rotation, speed of rotation, and 
direction of rotation. This signal is also used to detect a possible trapping condition.

Multi Drive Sunroof (MDS) Control Unit 

A separate control unit is installed for the panorama glass sunroof functions. The panora¬ 
ma glass sunroof control unit (multi drive sunroof MDS) controls and monitors the electric 
motors and thus the movement of the panorama glass sunroof. 

The MDS is installed in the headliner behind the panorama glass sunroof. It can be 
accessed from the rear of the vehicle. 

Roof Function Center (FZD) control unit 

The FZD is used to receive the sunroof switch status and convert it to a signal that can 
be transmitted to the MDS control unit over the K-CAN. The roof function center control 
unit also houses the sunroof switch. 


Roof Function Center Control Unit (FZD) 

Footwell Module (FRM) 

The FRM transmits the status of the driver’s lock cylinder for convenience open/close 
features. 

Junction Box 

The JB supplies the MDS control unit power via a KL30g circuit for panorama sunroof 
motor operation. 

Car Access System 2 

The CAS2 enables or disables the operation of the panorama sunroof by sending termi¬ 
nal status signals to the MDS control unit via the K-CAN. 

Dynamic Stability Control Unit 

The DSC control unit is responsible for making the vehicle speed signal available to the 
MDS control unit for wind deflector operation.

Principles of Operation 

The panorama sunroof operation has been almost entirely adapted from the E61 Sports 
Wagon and X3/X5. 

The only difference in operation is that when the sunroof glass panels are placed in the 
vent mode, the floating headliner does not vent from the middle. Instead the sunroof 
headliner slides back from the front section similar to conventional single panel sunroofs.
