E90/E91 xDrive 


Introduction 


The new 3 Series Sports Wagon satisfies the standards of style, flexibility and perfor¬ 
mance - far in excess of sheer driving pleasure. It combines first class driving dynamics 
with versatile functionality. 

It will be introduced in the US as a 325xiT in September 2005. Variants will be available 
in March 2006. 

The technical basis of the E91 is the E90, the 3 Series Sedan, with which the Sports 
wagon is virtually identical up to the B-pillar.Therefore, what has already been said about 
the 3 Series Sedan also applies to the Sports Wagon: It is - when compared with the 
previous model (E46) - stronger and bigger, and the E91 has above all become more 
functional. 

Like the Sedan, the E91 has sporty proportions thanks to its long engine bonnet and a 
striking swage line rising along the entire side of the caras an expression of powerful 
dynamics. 

The roof line of the Sports Wagon is like a Coupe and the roof spoiler is integrated in 
these lines. Roof rails are standard.

Engines 

Initially the E91 Sports Wagon will only be offered as a 325xiT with later configurations 
to follow. 

The new BMW N52-generation inline six cylinder engines deliver incomparable agility 
with more power but less weight and lowerfuel consumption. VALVETRONIC and dou¬ 
ble VANOS are additional features of this engine which, in the E91 as already in the E90, 
is combined exclusively with 6-speed gearboxes. 

xDrive All-Wheel-Drive System 

Initially the E91 Sports Wagon will only be offered in an all wheel drive version. At the 
same time, the all-wheel-drive system will also be making its debut in the new 3 Series 
Sedan (September2005). 

The system and function are already familiar from the X3, X5 and 5 Series. Some com¬ 
ponents such as e.g. the propeller shafts have been geometrically adapted to the altered 
space conditions in the 3 Series.
