Introduction 


The new Z4, successor to the E85 Z4 Roadster and E86 Z4 Coupe, is the first BMW 
Roadster to have a retractable hardtop. With its long engine compartment lid, large 
wheel apertures, long wheelbase and sguat overhang it features all typical elements 
of a BMW Roadster. The vehicle’s manufacturing has been moved from Spartanburg, 
South Carolina to the Regensburg, Germany plant. 

These features are further enhanced by the flat front section, the pronounced shoulder 
line and rear end. In addition, the engine compartment lid that extends over the wheel 
arches, the large BMW radiator grill, the side gills, the black A-pillar, the contoured roof 
and rear lights with innovative light technology further cement the characteristic accents 

The two-piece, electrohydraulically operated retractable hardtop made of lightweight 
aluminum panels takes approximately 20 seconds to open or close fully automatically. 
The compact stowage of the roof elements in the luggage compartment allows for a 
flat, Roadster-characteristic rear design and a luggage compartment volume between 
180 and 310 liters (6.3 and 10.9 cubic feet). Large window areas together with the 
heated glass rear window provide an optimum all-round field of view. 

All models are eguipped with Efficient Dynamics measures and thus no compromise 
has been made in terms of acceleration, performance and fuel economy. At launch in 
May 2009, the E89 is offered as tow model variants. 

Z4 sDrive35i - N54B3000 ( 300 hp / 300 Ib-ft) 

Z4 sDrive30i - N52B30O1 ( 255 hp / 220 Ib-ft) 

Both model variants come standard with a manual 6 speed transmission but if the 
automatic transmission option is desired, two transmissions are available. For the Z4 
sDrive30i, there is the familiar GA6HP19Z (TU) transmission. For the Z4 sDrive35i, 
the sports automatic with double clutch (DCT) GS7D36SG transmission that was first 
utilized in the fourth generation M3 is available. 

The new BMW Z4 is equipped with a three level dynamic driving control as standard. 
This allows the driver to change the accelerator pedal characteristics, gearshift program 
and shift speed of the optional automatic gearbox, DSC response and the optional 
adaptive M running gear with the touch of a button. 

Head and elbow clearance as well as ease of entry have been greatly improved com¬ 
pared to the predecessor model. The low seat position near the rear axle creates the 
typical ride experience of a BMW Roadster.

Retractable Hardtop 


The retractable hardtop consists of two aluminum roof panels. They are operated by 
means of an internal linkage. The retractable hardtop and the rear module are driven 
hydraulically. The hydraulic system consists of 6 hydraulic cylinders that are supplied with 
pressure by the hydraulic unit via the hydraulic lines. The cylinders are always actuated in 
pairs. The retractable hardtop is equipped with a headliner without tensioning cables.

System Components 


Microswitches and Hall Sensors 

The various positions of the retractable hardtop and of the rear module are detected by 
8 microswitches and 4 Hall sensors and signalled to the convertible top module CTM. 

All microswitches and Hall sensors receive their voltage supply from the convertible top 
module and have diagnostic capabilities. 

After loss of terminal 30 or after emergency operation, the retractable hardtop can still be 
operated without the need for re-initialization. The microswitches and Hall sensors ensure 
the convertible top module reliably detects the position of the retractable hardtop. 

Buttons for Operating the Hardtop 

Two buttons are provided in the center con¬ 
sole for the purpose of operating the 
retractable hardtop. These buttons are wired 
to the convertible top module. When a button 
is pressed, the convertible top module 
receives the information and executes the 
corresponding command. Movement of the 
retractable hardtop or side windows stops if 
the button is released while the hardtop is 
moving. Operation is indicated by a red LED 
in one button and a green LED in the other. 

The convertible top module actuates the 
LEDs via the K-CAN. 

The green LED in the button lights up during the opening/closing operation. The red LED 
signals an operating error or incorrect conditions (e.g. luggage compartment partition not 
in lower position). The red LED flashes as soon as the retractable hardtop is in an inter¬ 
mediate position and not operated. The LED flashing does not indicate a fault. The flash¬ 
ing LED draws attention to the fact that the vehicle cannot be driven in this situation. 

A fault code that cannot be read out is stored under following conditions: 

• Terminal R On while the button is pressed 

• When the button is pressed for longer than 20 seconds after roof operation 
has concluded. 

The retractable hardtop is then temporarily inoperative. The retractable hardtop 
can be operated again after pressing the Open button once. 



20 

E89 Complete Vehicle 


Convertible Top Module 

The Convertible top module (CTM) is the central electronic control unit for all functions of 
the retractable hardtop. The convertible top module is installed on the right in the luggage 
compartment. The convertible top module controls the retractable hardtop, the rear mod¬ 
ule, the automatic soft close system and the drive unit for locking the hardtop. 

The CTM also controls the hydraulic pump and the six hydraulic cylinders byway of the 
three valves in the hydraulic unit. The K-CAN connects the convertible top module to 
other control units. Information on outside temperature, driving speed and rear lid status 
etc., is received via the K-CAN. The convertible top module ends a signal to the car 
access system (CAS) when the retractable hardtop is opened or closed. The car access 
system is the master for the power windows. In certain situations, the convertible top 
module outputs information in the form of check control messages in the instrument 
cluster.

Drive for Locking the Retractable Hardtop 

The drive unit, consisting of an electric motor with gear mechanism, locks and unlocks 
the retractable hardtop with the cowl panel at the upper windscreen frame. The convert¬ 
ible top module actuates the electric motor. The drive unit is arranged in the middle. The 
retaining hooks on the right and left are moved by a rotary plate and push rods. The two 
Hall sensors ’cowl panel locked and unlocked’ monitor the locking procedure. 

When the retractable hardtop is opened, the drive unit locks the hardtop on the base 
plate in the rear module. This is a crash-lock function, which prevents the retracted hard¬ 
top from folding forward in the event of a crash.

Hydraulic Unit 

The hydraulic unit is located in a pan in the luggage compartment floor. The movement 
direction of the retractable hardtop and rear module are determined by corresponding 
valve positions and the direction of rotation of the hydraulic pump. The direction of rota¬ 
tion of the hydraulic pump is controlled by two relays. 

The hydraulic pump generates an operating pressure from 150 to 200 bar. 

The temperature in the hydraulic pump is measured to avoid the pump overheating dur¬ 
ing freguent use of the retractable hardtop. Two cables connect the temperature sensor 
ground-free to the convertible top module. A line break (open circuit) results in a fault 
code being entered in the fault code memory. At from a temperature of 90°C, hardtop 
closing movement already started is continued up to the secure end position. The move¬ 
ment of the retractable hardtop is stopped immediately at a temperature of 105°C. 

The movement can be continued after the temperature has dropped below 90°C. 

The hydraulic unit is protected by a 50 amp slow-blow fuse. 

Other than topping the hydraulic system off, the hydraulic fluid does not require any 
servicing. Add only the approved hydraulic fluid to the mark on the reservoir. 



Hydraulic Unit Location 


Note: Excessive noise during top operation may be due to aerated hydraulic 
lines. If excessive operating noise is heard during operation, the 
retractable hardtop should be opened and closed several times in order 
to automatically bleed the hydraulic system via the fluid reservoir. 


23 

E89 Complete Vehicle 









Instrument Cluster - KOMBI 

The instrument cluster provides the outside temperature (bus signal). The instrument 
cluster uses the check control symbol to show check control messages relating to the 
retractable hardtop. 

Footwell Module - FRM 

The footwell module FRM actuates the front power window regulators. The side windows 
must be lowered in order to open the retractable hardtop (bus signal to convertible top 
module). 

Junction Box Electronics - JBE 

The junction box electronics JBE actuates the rear power window regulators. The side 
windows must be lowered in order to open the retractable hardtop (bus signal to convert¬ 
ible top module). The junction box electronics provides the signal indicating whether the 
rear lid is closed (bus signal). 

The power distribution box in the junction box supplies terminal 30g to the convertible 
top module. The convertible top module additionally receives terminal 15 from the car 
access system. This still enables adequate communication with the BMW diagnosis sys¬ 
tem when, for example, the voltage supply from the junction box is interrupted. 

Car Access System - CAS 

The car access system is the master control unit for the power window regulators. On 
request of the convertible top module, the car access system lowers or raises the side 
windows. In addition, the car access system prevents the rear lid from being opened and 
movement of the power windows when the retractable hardtop is in an intermediate posi¬ 
tion. The car access system controls the auto-remote opening function for the retractable 
hardtop. The signals from the remote control are received by the remote control receiver 
and sent to the car access system. 

Antenna Diversity 

The convertible top module sends a corresponding signal to the antenna diversity mod¬ 
ule depending on whether the retractable hardtop is closed or open. The antenna diversi¬ 
ty function then correspondingly switches over the antennas. 


24 

E89 Complete Vehicle 



Principles of Operation 

The following options are available for operating the hardtop: 

• Using the button (close and open) 

• Using the key in the lock cylinder in the driver’s door handle (close and open) 

• Using the remote control (open only) 

• Using the ID transmitter with Comfort Access option (close, as long as the ID trans¬ 
mitter is within range of the comfort access antennas and open as with the remote 
control). 

Operating Pre-Conditions 

The retractable hardtop can be opened and closed using the button in the center 
console only if the following conditions are met: 

• Terminal R ON 

• Outside temperature above -12°C 

• Boot lid closed 

• Vehicle stationary (driving speed < 0.7 km/h) 

• Luggage compartment partition in lowest position 

• Lateral inclination of vehicle <11° 

• Power windows initialized 

• Battery voltage > 11.5 V 

• Less than five successive opening/closing operations 

• Hydraulic fluid temperature for opening < 90°C and for closing < 105°C 

• Electrical system check successful 

• Production, transport and workshop mode (FeTraWe) not set. 

It is not possible to open and close the retractable hardtop while driving. Due to the high 
current consumption of the retractable hardtop of up to 40 amps, the hardtop should only 
be operated when the battery charger is connected or the engine is running. 

Note: The rear power window regulators do not have an anti-trap system. 
There is also no one-touch function for closing the rear windows. 


25 

E89 Complete Vehicle 




Opening the Retractable Hardtop 

The retractable hardtop is normally operated by pressing the open or close button in the 
center console. The hardtop moves for as long as the button is pressed. The green LED 
in the button lights up while the retractable hardtop is moving. Movement of the 
retractable hardtop, rear module or side windows is stopped immediately if the button is 
released while the retractable hardtop is moving. The red LED then flashes in the button. 

Movement of the hardtop can be resumed by pressing the button again. Movement of 
the side windows can be resumed within 10 seconds. If one of the conditions is not met, 
the red LED will light continuously. 

The convertible top module checks the conditions for opening the retractable hardtop 
when the Open button in the center console is pressed. If the check is successful, the 
hardtop is opened as follows: 

• Lower side windows (if closed or in intermediate position) 

• Release hardtop at cowl panel 

• Switch off heated rear window (takes place via junction box electronics) 

• Unlock and open rear module 

• Roof panel 2 is released and packed over roof panel 1 

• Stow roof panel package in rear module and lock 

• Close and lock rear module 

• Close side windows. 

The hardtop is closed automatically in the reverse order. 

Operating Conditions with Comfort Access 

The following functions can be performed only when the ID transmitter 
is less than 4 m away: 

• Open 

• Close 

• Easy Load feature 


26 

E89 Complete Vehicle 




Automatic Soft Close System 

The automatic soft close function is installed as standard to conveniently close the rear 
[trunk] lid. The automatic soft close system consists of two drive units. The drive units 
lock the rear lid on the left and right on the rear module carrier. This increases the stability 
of the rear end. 



Automatic soft close drive (1) 


Each trunk lid latch assembly has a microswitch. These two microswitches are operated 
when the rear lid locks on the left and right have reached the lock strikers. The signals are 
hard wired to the junction box electronics which then makes the signal available to the 
convertible top module via the K-CAN-bus. The convertible top module then actuates the 
two drive units of the automatic soft close system until the rear lid is locked. 

Manually shutting the rear lid would make closing via the automatic soft close system 
unnecessary. For safety reasons, steps must be taken to ensure that the rear lid is com¬ 
pletely closed. For this reason, the drive units of the automatic soft close system are still 
actuated. 

Both drive units feature a repeat interlock to avoid overheating. The repeat interlock 
allows the automatic soft close system to be actuated up to 20 times (counter up to 
20 increments). The automatic soft close system is then inhibited electrically for approxi¬ 
mately 2 minutes.

Check Control Messages 

It is not possible to open or close the retractable hardtop in certain situations. In such 
cases, corresponding messages are shown in the instrument cluster in the form of check 
control messages. 

A short message and additional information are shown on vehicles eguipped with a cen¬ 
tral information display (CID). The check control messages provide explanatory informa¬ 
tion relating to the red LED in the button that lights up in the case of fault. An active 
check control message is shown every 5 seconds.

Convenient Loading Function of Rear Lid 

The retractable hardtop can be opened and closed using the ID transmitter on vehicles 
equipped with the Comfort Access option. 

The new auto-remote function for loading and unloading provides fast access to the lug¬ 
gage compartment when the retractable hardtop is down. This function makes it easier to 
load larger items of luggage for instance. The auto-remote function is activated as fol¬ 
lows: 

• Briefly press the rear lid button on the remote control 

• Then, press and hold the rear lid button on the remote control (no more than one 
second may pass between releasing and pressing the rear lid button). 

Initially, the rear module is unlocked and fully opened. The roof package is swivelled out 
of the luggage compartment. The rear module is then closed and locked. The rear lid is 
unlocked by the automatic soft close system. The boot lid opens a little. The auto-remote 
functions via the remote control conform to national market specifications. 

Emergency Opening of Rear Lid 

As there is no lock cylinder and Bowden cable assembly, the rear lid cannot be released 
in the event of the rear lid lock being defective. At the same time, movement of the 
retractable hardtop is inhibited by the unknown status of the rear lid. 

The lid can be opened if the Bowden cable (emergency glow in the dark) handle can be 
reached from the through load compartment. 

The rear lid can also be forced to open by using the diagnostic tester. The rear lid activa¬ 
tion via the JBE component activation function. This activation request ignores all status 
that would typically inhibit rear lid operation such as top position. 

Emergency Actuation of the Retractable Hardtop 

An emergency actuation facility for releasing the retractable hardtop by the customer is 
not possible. Emergency actuation is, however, possible in the service workshop. The 
emergency actuation procedure is described in detail in the repair instructions.

MOST Direct Access Port 


Because the vehicle is based on a 2000BN vehicle and is equipped with a MOST-bus, 
MOST direct access port is also installed in the E89. The MOST direct access port is 
located on the left in the footwell. 

The two connected plugs must be taken from the common connector (A). The two plugs 
are then connected together (B). The integrated communication optical module ICOM 
can now be connected in the usual way to the joined plug.

Multiple Restraint System 7 

The 7th generation multiple restraint system MRS is a consistent further development of 
the multiple restraint systems fitted in BMW vehicles. 

The multiple restraint system detects an accident situation that is critical for the occu¬ 
pants and activates the necessary restraint systems. The restraint system is activated 
selectively depending on the severity and type of accident. 

Passenger Seat Occupancy Detection 

The new passenger seat occupancy detection system introduced on the E89 consists of 
a seat occupancy pad with integrated capacitor plate. The previous generation occupan¬ 
cy (OC3) detection was realized via the use of pressure sensors attached to the seat 
cushion. 

In the new capacitive sensing passenger occupancy detection system, an electrical field 
is generated across the capacitor plate and vehicle ground. The seat occupancy mat is 
connected to an electronic evaluator. The occupancy status is classified based on the 
evaluation of the electrical field. 

A person sitting down on the seat changes the electrical field. The change is registered 
by the electronic evaluator and the corresponding status is determined. The electronic 
evaluator sends the status information cyclically to the MRS control unit. Data exchange 
takes place by means of a hardware link. The seat occupancy detection function monitors 
the inputs and outputs. Possible fault statuses are stored in the fault code memory of the 
MRS control unit.

E89 Chassis and Suspension 



The handling and agility of the E89 are outstanding in this vehicle class. This is achieved 
by the rear wheel drive, an optimum steering response and outstanding traction in all load 
situations. It has been possible to optimally match the front axle kinematics and steering 
as no allowances had to be made for drive influences. An axle load distribution between 
50:50 and 44:56 has been achieved in all load situations.

Double-joint Spring Strut Front Axle 

A modified version of the double-joint spring strut front axle known from the E8x and E9x 
series vehicles is used in the E89. Adaptations were necessary due to the available space 
and the modified suspension geometry. 

The graphic uses colors to show an overview of the common parts, modified compo¬ 
nents and new components in the E89 compared to the E85 and compared to the E9x 
and E8x models for the front axle. 

Some components have been fully adopted, others have been adapted and optimized to 
the changed conditions while other components are a complete new development. In the 
same way as the E8x and E9x models, the E89 is based on the well-known principle of 
the double--joint spring strut front axle. The well-proven principle of the central link rear 
axle from the E85 is retained for the rear axle.

Dynamic Driving Systems 
Differentiation 

The dynamic driving systems are differentiated in three directions of action and are 
assigned to the individual dynamic systems corresponding to their main direction of 
action: 

• Longitudinal dynamics systems 

- Dynamic stability control (DSC) 

- Electromechanical parking brake (EMF) 

• Transverse dynamics systems 

- Electromechanical power steering (electronic power steering EPS) 

• Vertical dynamics systems 

- Adaptive M chassis and suspension 

Changes and New Features 

The parking brake on the E89 is designed as an electromechanical parking brake EMF. 
The EMF on the E89 differs from the known EMF systems in that it is integrated in the 
brake calliper. Competitors are already using this system in series production.

The E85 was equipped with a single-joint spring strut front axle. To optimize the suspen¬ 
sion properties, the E89 is equipped with a double-joint spring strut front axle. The rea¬ 
sons are explained in the following. 


42 

E89 Complete Vehicle 






















Kingpin Offset 

The kingpin offset (scrub radius) of the E89 is greater compared to that of the E85. The 
reason for this is that the front axle has been adopted from production line 2 (1 Series 
and 3 Series). 


On the single-joint spring strut front axle of the E85 
the position of the wheel control joint largely deter¬ 
mines the size of the kingpin offset. Since the king¬ 
pin offset should be as small as possible, the wheel 
control joint must be located as far towards the out¬ 
side as possible. This however results in problems 
concerning the package space for the brake disc 
and brake calliper. On the double-joint spring strut 
front axle the position of the control arm and tension 
strut with respect to each other determines the size 
of the kingpin offset. 

The pivot points of the control arm or wishbone and tension strut at the swivel bearing 
can therefore be selected such that no space problems are encountered for the brake 
system. 

While these aspects still retain their validity, a larger kingpin offset than on the single-joint 
spring strut front axle is now used. The reason for this is that common parts from produc¬ 
tion line 2 are used as far as possible but the track width has increased compared to the 
1 Series and 3 Series. Among other measures, this was achieved by changing the rim 
offset, thus, of course, also increasing the kingpin offset. 



Determining the lower pivot point 


The effects of increased susceptibility to interference caused by a larger kingpin offset 
were eliminated by an optimized and modified elastokinematics system and tuned to 
such an extent that an improvement was achieved compared to the E85. As a result, the 
response of the E89 to steering movements is slightly more indirect at high speeds and 
very direct at speeds up to 100 km/h. The vehicle handling is very balanced up to the limit 
range and therefore has outstanding control properties.

Both tension struts are mounted with hydraulic bushings on the front axle carrier. In addi¬ 
tion, the distance of the tension strut and control arm pivot points at the swivel bearing 
largely determines the vertical force lever arm. The further the joints of the tension strut 
and control arm are from each other at the swivel bearing, the greater the recovery force 
initiated by the vehicle weight. 

On the single-joint spring strut front axle, the distance is zero as the two joints of this axle 
have merged to form one. The resulting advantage of the double-joint spring strut front 
axle is improved directional stability in the high speed range and a lower tendency to 
steering instability in the lower speed range (less susceptible to torsional vibration in the 
steering wheel). 

Compared to that of the control arm, the ball joint (guide joint) of the tension strut is 
raised at the swivel bearing, thus providing effective anti-dive control. A further advantage 
of this arrangement is that this tension strut mount on the axle carrier can be arranged at 
approximately the same level with respect to the mounting at the swivel bearing and does 
not have to be lowered. This is of particular benefit to a large overhang angle. In addition, 
it is possible to lower the control arm mount on the axle carrier side, thus enabling a lower 
roll center. 

The single-joint axle features only one type of cross brace as the axle carrier. The double¬ 
joint spring strut front axle on the other hand features a frame which additionally provides 
significant stiffening of the front end.

Central-link Rear Axle 

An adapted version of the rear axle known from the E85 with the development designa¬ 
tion HA 3 is fitted in the E89. 

The central link rear axle is an intricately constructed, weight and space saving, multi-link 
rear axle. The wheels are controlled by two control arms and one semi-trailing arm that is 
mounted at the central point on the body. The precise interaction between the semi-trail¬ 
ing arm and control arm ensures that the wheels remain in the best possible position with 
respect to the road surface, thus providing outstanding directional stability. The flexible 
link bearings ensure exceptional driving stability while cornering, providing the vehicle 
with excellent rolling and acoustic comfort. 

The designation HA 3 does not refer to the three links but rather is a continuation of the 
development designation at BMW. The central link rear axle optimizes the following prop¬ 
erties: 

• Directional stability 

• Alternating load response 

• Self-steering response 

• Lane change stability 

• Transition response from cornering to straight ahead 

• Rolling comfort.

Brakes 


The function and weight of the service brake have been improved. Aluminum floating cal¬ 
liper brakes and aluminum frame calliper brakes are fitted on the front axle. Lightweight 
brake discs are used on the front axle of both top models. Outstanding stability was 
achieved by the corresponding dimensioning. The brake pad control principle as well as 
the brake callipers and brake discs secure the long-term properties in terms of surface 
protection, corrosion protection and unsusceptibility to soiling.

Parking Brake 

For the first time at BMW, the E89 is equipped with an electromechanical parking brake 
integrated in the brake calliper. The use of the electromechanical parking brake offers the 
following advantages: 

• Operation by means of a button ergonomically positioned in the center console 

• Reliable application and release of the electromechanical parking brake (EMF) under 
all conditions 

• Dynamic emergency braking function also at low friction ensured by the control sys¬ 
tems (ABS) 

• No parking brake lever means additional storage space in the area of the center con¬ 
sole.

Principles of Operation 

The EMF control unit receives the driver’s choice to apply the parking brake from the 
EMF button on the center console. The vehicle status is determined via the link to the 
electrical system and the bus systems and the control unit decides whether all conditions 
for applying the brake are met. If this is the case, the two EMF actuators on the rear brake 
callipers are actuated.

Due to the self-locking characteristics of the spindle, the tension is retained even when 
no power is applied, thus firmly holding the vehicle. On reaching the reguired force, the 
applied brake status is indicated by a red indicator lamp in the instrument cluster and an 
additional red LED in the EMF button.

Function of the EMF Actuator 


The EMF actuator is mounted on the brake calliper and pushes directly on the back of 
the “normally” hydraulically operated brake piston.

Connection to spindle 


The force is transmitted via electric motor (2) and drive belt (3) to a two-stage planetary 
gear train (4). Spindle (4) shown in the following graphic is driven by spindle connection 
(6). Spindle (4) in the spindle nut with anti-twist lock (2) in brake piston (3) provides the 
self-locking effect. The force is transmitted via the spindle and spindle nut with anti-twist 
lock to brake piston (3). As in hydraulically operated systems, the brake piston acts on the 
brake pads that are forced against the brake disc. Due to the self-locking effect of the 
spindle in the spindle nut with anti-twist lock, the tension is retained and the vehicle is 
held firmly even when no power is applied.

Brake Piston 


The brake fluid can flow via grooves (1) past the spindle nut to ensure the brake system is 
completely bled. The screw-in travel is limited by spindle stop (5). This therefore prevents 
tightening and blocking when in open state.

The driver can apply the parking brake by pulling the EMF button. The operating direction 
is the same as that of the mechanical handbrake lever. 

The signal from the EMF button is read by the EMF control unit. The EMF control unit 
individually activates the EMF actuators at the wheel brake. 


62 

E89 Complete Vehicle 







The parking brake can be applied in any logical terminal status. Applying the parking 
brake at terminal 0 is made possible by connecting terminal 30 to the EMF control unit. 
The EMF control unit is woken up when the driver operates the EMF button at terminal 
0. In turn, the EMF control unit wakes the other control units in the vehicle. Only then 
does the EMF control unit receive the important information on the stationary status of 
the vehicle. In addition, the change status of the parking brake can be indicated after 
waking the control unit. 


The parking brake applied status is indicated by a red LED in the EMF button and by the 
EMF indicator lamp in the instrument cluster. If the parking brake is already applied, 
pulling the EMF button again will have no effect.

Rolling Monitor with Parking Brake Applied 

This monitoring function is designed to prevent the vehicle from rolling with the parking 
brake applied. The rolling monitor is always activated when the status of the parking brake 
changes from released to applied and ends after a defined period of time after this status 
change. 


The function ends: 


• when a fault occurs that prevents mechanical retensioning 

• when the vehicle assumes sleep mode, the control unit is switched off or reset. 

The DSC uses a signal as the input variable for rolling detection. The tension at the EMF 
actuators is immediately increased as soon as this signal indicates that the vehicle is 
starting to roll during rolling monitoring. During the retensioning phase, the tensioning 
force is increased until the vehicle no longer rolls or a maximum tensioning force is 
reached. 


Temperature Monitoring 

The task of the temperature monitoring function is to compensate for the loss of force 
that occurs when the hot brake disc cools down. Temperature monitoring is activated 
when the temperature exceeds a defined value as the status of the parking brake 
changes from released to applied. 

The DSC control unit calculates the brake disc temperature at the individual wheels and 
sends the corresponding value to the EMF control unit. During the status change, the 
higher temperature of the two brake discs is taken for the temperature monitoring func¬ 
tion. A characteristic map contains the corresponding temperature ranges with the asso¬ 
ciated retensioning times. 


63 

E89 Complete Vehicle 



The corresponding retensioning times in the characteristic map are activated depending 
on the temperature during the status change. The tension is increased once when the 
first retensioning time is reached. The tension is then increased again after the second 
retensioning time has elapsed and increased yet again after the third. The characteristic 
map may also contain the value 0 for one or several retensioning times. In these cases, 
the corresponding increase in tension does not take place. The function ends under fol¬ 
lowing conditions: 

• Occurrence of a fault that prevents retensioning 

• The control unit is switched off or reset 

• The last retensioning step has already been executed. 

Releasing the Parking Brake 

The EMF button is pushed down to release the parking brake. For the parking brake to 
actually release terminal 15 must additionally be on and at least one of the following con¬ 
ditions must apply: 

• Brake pedal pressed or 

• Parking lock of automatic gearbox engaged or clutch pedal pressed 
(only vehicle with manual gearbox). 

This prevents the vehicle from inadvertently rolling if, for example, the EMF button is 
pressed by another occupant instead of the driver. The LED in the EMF button and the 
EMF indicator in the instrument cluster go out when the parking brake is released. 

Activation of the EMF actuator causes the spindle to rotate. The rotation of the spindle 
causes the spindle nut to move a short defined distance from the brake piston. 

Dynamic Emergency Braking 

Two operating units for the brake are required by law. Besides the brake pedal, the sec¬ 
ond operating unit in the E89 is the EMF button in the center console. Pulling the EMF 
button while driving triggers dynamic emergency braking with a defined sequence via the 
DSC system. This function is intended for emergencies when the driver can no longer 
slow down the vehicle using the brake pedal. Other occupants can also stop the vehicle 
in this way should, for example, the driver suddenly become unconscious. 

During dynamic emergency braking, hydraulic braking pressure is built up at all four wheel 
brakes. The DSC functions are fully active and the brake lights come on. This is an impor¬ 
tant advantage compared to a manual parking brake. 

Dynamic emergency braking takes place only for as long as the driver is pulling the EMF 
button. The deceleration initiated by the DSC is increased in ramps. The EMF indicator 
lamp in the instrument cluster is activated during dynamic emergency braking. In addi¬ 
tion, a check control message is given together with an acoustic signal in order to warn 
the driver of this adverse situation. 


64 

E89 Complete Vehicle 



The DSC control unit prioritizes if the driver attempts to slow down the vehicle by simul¬ 
taneously pressing the brake pedal and pulling the EMF button. The higher deceleration 
reguest is implemented. If dynamic emergency braking is continued until the vehicle 
comes to a stop, the parking brake will remain applied even after the EMF button is 
released. The EMF indicator lamp in the instrument cluster remains active. The driver 
can then release the parking brake (see Releasing the Parking Brake). 


Parking Brake Fault 

The EMF indicator lamp in the instrument cluster lights yellow to indicate a fault in the 
parking brake. A check control message is also output.

Emergency Release 

No parking brake emergency release function is provided for the customer. The parking 
brake can be released using the BMW diagnosis system or the EMF actuators are 
removed and the spindle is turned back manually. 


Changing Brake Pads 

To change the brake pads, the EMF actuator must be in the fully opened position so that 
the brake piston can be pushed back. The BMW diagnosis system can be used to actu¬ 
ate the EMF actuators and assume the fully opened position. This position is necessary 
to change the brake pads. Installation mode is set automatically on reaching the installa¬ 
tion position.

For safety reasons, the parking brake cannot be activated for as long as the 
EMF control unit is in installation mode. If the EMF button is pulled, the EMF 
indicator lamp in the instrument cluster will flash yellow. 


65 

E89 Complete Vehicle 





Installation mode can be cancelled in two ways: 

• By carrying out the service function Reset Installation Mode with the aid of ISTA 

• By driving the vehicle and exceeding a programmed minimum speed. 

After being changed, the brake pads must be bedded-in. This is necessary to ensure the 
brake pad and brake disc pairing assumes the specified friction parameters. Only then will 
the reguired braking force be reached. 

The exact procedure for bedding-in the service brakes is described in the 
Repair Instructions. The instructions must be followed exactly. 

Brake Test Rig Recognition 

The EMF control unit recognizes the brake test rig based on a plausibility check (wheel 
speed comparison) and assumes brake test rig mode. The following target positions are 
assumed in succession by pulling the EMF button several times: 

• Brake pads applied 

• Force 1 for brake test rig 

• Force 2 for brake test rig 

• Target force. 

The EMF indicator lamp flashes slowly when brake test rig mode is activated and the 
EMF actuators are released. 

The EMF indicator lamp begins to flash fast when brake test rig mode is activated and 
EMF actuators are partially applied. 

The EMF indicator lamp lights permanently when brake test rig mode is activated and 
EMF actuators are fully applied. 

The parking brake can be released on the brake test rig without pressing the brake pedal 
or clutch pedal. 

Brake test rig mode is automatically cancelled on exiting the brake test rig. The mode is 
also deactivated by pressing the EMF button or if a fault occurs.

Suspension and Damping 
Basic Suspension Setup 

The spring struts on the front axle are made of steel and are connected in a clamp 
arrangement to the aluminum wheel carrier. Two-tube gas-pressurized dampers are used. 
The piston rods on the front axle are hollow. The piston in the shock absorbers are coat¬ 
ed with PTFE (colloquially also known as Teflon). 

The coil springs on the front and rear axle have been are optimized in terms of their ten¬ 
sion and weight. To ensure a constant ride height is achieved depending on the engine 
and vehicle eguipment, as on all BMW vehicles, different springs are used that are adapt¬ 
ed to the specific vehicle weight. 

Stabilizer bars are used on the front and rear axles. For weight reasons, the stabilizer bar 
on the front axle is of a tubular/hollow design. 

Adaptive M Chassis and Suspension 

The adaptive M suspension setup is lower by 10 mm. Four continuously adjustable 
shock absorbers in the optional Adaptive M chassis and suspension achieve variable 
damping forces to suit the driving situation by means of coupled tension/compression 
stage adjustment (continuous electronic damper control EDC-K). The shock absorbers 
are automatically set harder (more dynamic/sporty) or softer (more comfortable) corre¬ 
sponding to the driving situation. 

In contrast to the E70/E71 and F01/F02 a bus system is not used in the E89 for data 
transfer. The VDM control unit is responsible for controlling the vertical movements. On 
the E89, the EDC-K function is integrated in the VDM control unit. The E89 does not fea¬ 
ture any other vertical dynamics systems. 

The EDC-K system on the E70/E71 and F01/F02 is known as vertical dynamics control. 
The designation was changed because the actuator units for the dampers are controlled 
by satellites on the shock absorbers and data transmission from the VDM control unit to 
the satellites takes place via FlexRay. 

Also on the E89, the damper control can be influenced by means of the dynamic driving 
control switch on the center console. Two characteristic curves are used, which, in addi¬ 
tion to a comfortable characteristic (normal) additionally enable another distinctly sports- 
orientated characteristic (sport).

Function 

The input parameters such as road condition, vehicle load and driving style are registered 
directly by the system and used to activate the corresponding characteristic map as 
reguired. This results in improved damping over a broad range with distinct comfort and 
safety advantages. 


71 

E89 Complete Vehicle 
























The aim of EDC is to clearly increase vibration comfort (vehicle movement) without com¬ 
promising on driving characteristics (wheel-related movement) and safety. Three acceler¬ 
ation sensors register the driving dynamics of the vehicle and send the data each over a 
separate data line to the VDM control unit. Sensors register the following values: 

• Vehicle speed 

• Vertical acceleration 

• Longitudinal acceleration and deceleration 

• Steering angle 

• Ride height. 

The EDC valves are set to the hard position when no power is applied (failsafe position). 
The EDC valves are actuated by the VDM control unit and are set towards soft. The VDM 
control unit contains adaptive controllers with four output stages and converts the signals 
corresponding to a defined characteristic map. For this purpose, the four EDC valves on 
the shock absorbers are actuated independently (wheel-individual). 

An EDC valve externally mounted on each shock absorber is responsible for controlling 
the oil flow in the tension and compression stages (damping). The shock absorbers are 
automatically set harder (increases dynamics) or softer (increased comfort) corresponding 
to the driving situation. In the event of the VDM control unit failing, the power supply to 
the EDC valves is disconnected and they are closed mechanically by springs, thus fixing 
the EDV valves in the hard position. 

The dynamic driving switch makes it possible to additionally influence the control system. 

Sensors 

Additional sensors and information from existing systems are reguired to ensure the EDC 
operates correctly. 

For instance, the EDC receives information on the vertical acceleration as the springs 
compress and recoil from the three additionally installed acceleration sensors. The accel¬ 
eration sensors are fitted on the front left, front right and rear right. The acceleration sen¬ 
sors on the front and rear axles make it possible to register the movement of the vehicle 
body with respect to the road surface. 

The steering column switch cluster makes available the rate of change in the steering 
angle in the form of a signal on the PT-CAN. The signal for the front left and front right 
wheel speed is also made available on the PT-CAN. The signal is provided by the DSC 
control unit. 

The DSC sensor makes available the longitudinal acceleration signal on the PT-CAN. The 
ride-height values are registered by a ride-height sensor on the front axle and on the rear 
axle and are also made available.

Dynamic Driving Systems 
Overview 

Fundamentally, the dynamic driving systems can be divided into three acceleration axes. 
The X-axis denotes the longitudinal dynamics, the Y-axis the transverse dynamics and the 
Z-axis the vertical dynamics. All dynamic driving systems act on one or several axes. The 
following overview shows the dynamic driving systems available for the E89 together with 
the effective axes.

Vertical Dynamics Management VDM 

Electronic clamper control EDC is used as the vertical dynamic system in the E89. The 
EDC function is integrated in the VDM control unit. The sales designation for the E89 is 
Adaptive M suspension. 

Dynamic Cruise Control DCC 

The option SA544 Cruise Control with Brake Function (also known as also known as 
Dynamic Cruise Control) is available for the E89. 

Dynamic Driving Control in the E89 

Compared to the E85/E86, the new dynamic control in the E89 has two new features: 

• All dynamic driving systems available in the vehicle are influenced in full. 

• Three levels are available. The status of the dynamic stability control is also taken 
into account thus making two further levels possible. 

Dynamic Driving Switch 

The E85/E86 was eguipped with a SPORT button that influences several systems. 

The SPORT button switched the steering, automatic transmission and accelerator 
pedal between a standard mode and a sports mode. This made it possible to match 
these three systems more effectively in the two available modes. As a result, the cus¬ 
tomer experienced a vehicle trimmed to a sports driving style without compromise in 
sports mode. 

Dynamic driving control is activated by a new dynamic driving switch and the DTC button 
arranged directly in front of it. Dynamic driving control combines the activation of many 
vehicle drive and dynamic driving functions. 

The overall vehicle then assumes the characteristics that the driver expects in the select¬ 
ed drive range. With this bundling of functions, the vehicle characteristic can be set con¬ 
siderably more pronounced and less compromising. In response, the large number of, in 
part, unfeasible individual combinations is avoided (for example: sports steering and com¬ 
fort-orientated damping).

In addition to the indicator in the instrument cluster, an assistance window also appears in 
the CID when the DTC button or dynamic driving switch is pressed. The newly selected 
mode is shown here and explained by an additional text. 

Modes and Their Effects 

The entire vehicle has a coherent response due to the fact that the individual systems are 
switched jointly and in a co-ordinated manner. This configuration avoids unfeasible com¬ 
binations. For instance, this configuration rules out a sports accelerator pedal characteris¬ 
tic together with an extremely comfort-orientated shift program of the automatic transmis¬ 
sion. The following table shows the possible combinations and the five available modes.

Electric Power Steering (EPS) 


The main difference between hydraulic and electric power steering systems is in the 
method of generating the power assistance force that reduces the amount of force that 
the driver has to apply to the steering wheel. 

Hydraulic power steering systems feature a pump that is driven either by a belt running 
off the engine or by an electric motor. The pump is part of a hydraulic system which gen¬ 
erates the fluid pressure/flow that is used to produce the power assistance for steering. 

Electric power steering systems produce the power assistance force directly by means 
of an electric motor that transmits its torgue either to the steering column or the steering 
gear. Therefore, such systems generally reguire extra gearing to connect the electric 
motor to the existing steering system components. 

Otherwise, the basic design of the steering system is the same (e.g. rack-and-pinion 
steering gear for both hydraulic and electric power steering systems). 

The steering characteristics, e.g. amount of steering force reguired, progression of steer¬ 
ing force, feedback from the roadwheels, are subject to strict development specifications 
that have resulted in continual optimization of the hydraulic power steering systems so 
far used. The new electric power steering systems have to match up to the outstanding 
steering characteristics of BMW vehicles BMW owners have come to experience. 

Versions of Electric Power Steering 

The table below categorizes EPS systems on the basis of the mounting position of the 
servo unit consisting of electric motor and reduction gearing. With the advent of EPS, 
the method of generating the power assistance for steering changes from hydraulic to 
electrical means.

Distinction from Active Steering 

The electric motor of an EPS system is capable of superimposing additional force in 
addition to the force applied by the driver. The EPS is able to determine the level and tim¬ 
ing of that force independently of such factors as the engine speed. 

The rigid link between the steering wheel and the front wheels remains unchanged with 
electric power steering. The gear ratio of the rack is fixed, so the position of the steering 
wheel is always directly related to the position of the front wheels. 

The electric motor in an active steering system, by contrast, is capable of superimposing 
a steering angle (which changes the ratio between steering wheel and front wheels) but 
not a steering force. 

The steering train of an active steering system is split by a double planetary gear. This 
enables the active steering to alter the steering angle of the roadwheels without it being 
felt by the driver through the steering wheel. 

In order for the wheels to adopt the total steering angle produced by the steering wheel 
position plus the superimposed adjustment, a bracing force is reguired: the driver has to 
hold the steering wheel firmly. A pump unit is also reguired. This can only be of the 
hydraulic type on active steering systems. Only hydraulic pump units are currently capa¬ 
ble of providing the combination of high positioning force and positioning speed. 

Features 

The use of electric power steering provides many advantages for the BMW customer, the 
environment and the BMW Group. 

Interacting with the well-proven suspension concepts, a unigue combination of driving 
comfort and dynamics is achieved. The steering properties (e.g. the level of steering 
torgue assistance and damping) can be finely tuned by correspondingly programming the 
electrical system while ensuring optimum adaptation to the different vehicle philosophies. 

Thus, despite the use of identical mechanical components, the system will be capable of 
perfect adaptation to future BMW models. 

Where more precise steering and better handling characteristics are desired for a more 
sports-style model, it can be achieved by reducing the amount of power assistance. 

Although the driver then has to apply slightly more force to the steering wheel, the feed¬ 
back from the roadwheels gives the more "direct" feel desired. 

By contrast, a greater degree of power assistance can be programmed for models whose 
steering characteristics are to be more comfort-orientated. 

With the disappearance of the hydraulic system (consisting of pump, hoses, cooler, fluid, 
etc.), assembly of the steering on the production line is more efficient for the manufactur¬ 
er. The EPS steering system is supplied as a pre-assembled unit and fitted to the vehicle 
as such. In addition, the EPS also eliminates the environmental hazard of hydraulic fluid 
leakage. 

79 

E89 Complete Vehicle 



Because the electric motor is activated only when required (when steering but not when 
driving straight ahead) fuel consumption is reduced and the effective power output of the 
combustion engine increased when compared to a conventional hydraulic power steering 
system.

two steering systems.

Features of Electric Power Steering 

Improved Handling Dynamics 

• Steering characteristics perfectly adapted to vehicle model 

• Active return to center 

• Linear dynamics benefits of up to 2 kW 

Greater Driving Comfort 

• Steering train isolated from suspension vibration while still transmitting the important 
road feedback (different road surface conditions) to the driver 

• Improved isolation of interference from the road surface (less steering judder) 

• Electronically controlled, speed-dependent power-assistance (e.g. greater when 
parking) 

Greater Driving Safety 

• Servotronic function: EPS assists the driver to hold the correct line, particularly at 
high speeds, by providing a lower level of power assistance than at low speeds. 

• Steering wheel backlash is reduced by active speed-dependent damping. This func¬ 
tion also reduces the vehicle's tendency to slew in response to abrupt steering

System Components 


The main components of the EPS system are the: 

• Steering torque sensor 

• EPS control unit 

• Electric motor with position sensor 

• Reduction gear 

• Steering rack 


Steering Torque Sensor 


The steering torque sensor provides the EPS control unit with information about the 
steering torque applied by the driver in the form of an input signal. The EPS control unit 
uses that signal and other input signals to calculate the power assistance torque and 
operates the electric motor accordingly. The torque produced by the electric motor is 
added by way of the reduction gear to the steering torque applied by the driver. The total 
torque is converted by the steering rack into steering force at the front wheels.

Rotation of the input shaft (3) and ring magnet (5) is detected and electronically analysed 
by the sensor unit (1). The fundamental sensing principle applied is called the Hall effect. 

As the rigidity of the torsion bar (2) inside the input shaft is known, the electronic circuitry 
can calculate the amount of torque applied from the degree of twist. 

The steering torque is then digitally transmitted to the EPS control unit via a direct cable 
connection. 


85 

E89 Complete Vehicle 
















The sensor signal is provided with redundant back-up (a second identical sensor) so that 
system availability in the event of sensor failure is improved. If an unacceptable degree of 
divergence between the two sensors is detected during operation, the system continues 
to operate on the basis of the more plausible of the two signals and full EPS functionality 
is maintained. 

If the fault status remains present at the end of the driving cycle, a fault memory entry is 
generated and the EPS does not operate when the next driving cycle starts. 

EPS Control Unit 

As well as the control circuitry, the EPS control unit also contains the power electronics 
for operating the electric motor. 

The power electronics includes a multiple output relay that turns off the power supply to 
the motor windings in the event of a fault. Breaking the circuit allows the motor shaft to 
rotate freely. Fault conditions in which the motor would electrically lock up are avoided. 

There is a temperature sensor integrated in the control unit that is required for detecting 
overload situations.

The housing of the EPS control unit (and the electric motor) is located in a position 
exposed to large temperature fluctuations and high external moisture levels. Therefore, 
there is a diaphragm made of Goretex on the housing that egualizes the pressure differ¬ 
ence between the inside and outside of the housing but still prevents moisture intrusion 
at that point. 

On the EPS control unit and electric motor housing there are also the following EPS elec¬ 
trical connections: 

• Power supply for the EPS 

• Bus connection (PT-CAN inc. wake-up line) 

• Power supply and signal line for steering torgue sensor 

Electric Motor with Position Sensor 

The essential function of the electric motor is to generate the reguired torgue calculated 
by the EPS control unit. 

The type of electric motor used is a brushless DC motor (made by Siemens). 

Although it is powered by direct current, its method of operation is based on that of an 
AC synchronous motor. The power electronics in the EPS control unit convert the power 
supply voltage (DC voltage) into phase voltages so as to produce a rotating field at the 
phase windings. 

Only this type of motor combines the following characteristics that are decisive for use in 
an EPS system: 

• High efficiency • Low wear 

• Long service life • High thermal load capacity 

• Small external dimensions • Constantly high torgue over a wide speed range 

The electric motor is almost exclusively operated in the speed range throughout which its 
torgue is constant. Only in rare cases involving extremely high rates of steering angle 
change applied by the driver does the speed briefly reach the point at which the torgue 
curve falls away with increasing motor speed. Very aware drivers may perceive this as 
reduction of power steering assistance. In contrast with hydraulic power steering, where 
the drop is noticeable as an abrupt stiffening, the change is progressive with EPS, which 
is generally perceived as more pleasant. 

The maximum power consumption (transient) is 85 A so that at a rated voltage of 12 V a 
peak output of approximately 1 kW results. The fuse in the trunk that protects the power 
circuit against shorting has an appropriately high rating for that high current draw.

Hydraulic power steering pump - relationship of torque to steering angle rate of change 


In contrast with the peak output, the average output required for delivery of EPS functions 
is very low. It is only between approx. 20 W and 40 W (depending on driving profile) 
because the electric motor is only supplied with power on demand, e.g. when cornering 
but not when travelling in a straight line (without having to use the steering). 

Demand-based operation of the electric motor is the main reason why the fuel consump¬ 
tion of vehicles with EPS is around 0.2 I /100 km less than that of vehicles with hydraulic 
power steering. And on the other hand, the power that would otherwise be required to 
constantly drive the power steering pump is now almost entirely available as additional 
motive power for the vehicle. Depending on the situation, there can be a linear dynamics 
gain of up to 2 kW. 

A second important component is actually on the circuit board of the EPS control unit but 
is located directly adjacent to the electric motor shaft: the motor position sensor. In that 
way the motor position sensor can directly signal the electric motor's rotor position to the 
EPS control unit. As the electric motor is rigidly connected to the steering rack by means 
of the reduction gearing, the EPS control unit can deduce the position of the roadwheels 
and the steering angle from the rotor position. 

After first calibrating the straight-ahead position with the aid of the signal from the steer¬ 
ing angle sensor, the motor position sensor signal is subsequently used for the EPS func¬ 
tions (e.g. "active steering-wheel return"). The reason for this is the higher resolution of 
the motor position sensor signal. 


88 

E89 Complete Vehicle 





















The sensing principle applied by the motor position sensor is identical with that used by 
the steering torgue sensor. Both consist of Hall-effect sensor units adjacent to which 
there is a rotating magnet. The steering torgue sensor is designed to detect small 
degrees of twist, while the motor position sensor must detect large amounts of rotation (a 
complete revolution must be measurable). The motor position sensor is also duplicated, 
though in this case the duplicate unit has a different resolution in order to be able to pick 
up both fast and slow movements effectively. 

Reduction Gear 

The reduction gearing transmits the torgue generated by the electric motor to the steer¬ 
ing rack, thereby applying steering force to the front wheels. 

The overall transmission ratio is approximately 20 revolutions of the electric motor to one 
revolution of the steering wheel. That low gearing ratio combined with the high torgue of 
the electric motor makes it possible to generate the required steering rack forces. 

The low ratio combined with the rotating mass of the electric motor also has a damping 
effect on feedback from the road and roadwheels (as described in the section "Active 
damping"). 

The reduction gearing consists of the belt drive and reciprocating ball (screw) drive.

The electric motor shaft drives the small gearwheel (8) of the belt drive directly. Via the 
toothed drive belt (6) and the large gearwheel (9), the nut (4) of the ball screw drive is 
made to rotate. 

That nut contains a return channel (2) and mechanisms at either end of the bearing race 
for feeding the ball bearings into (3) and out of (1) the ball screw thread of the steering 
rack (5). Thus, the ball bearings circulate within a "closed system". 

As the nut cannot move along the steering rack, the ball bearings moving along the ball 
screw thread exert an axial force on the steering rack. 

The reduction gearing is inseparably attached to the electric motor. Repairs or adjust¬ 
ments to it as a separate component are not possible. 

The reduction gearing and its components (including the drive belt) are designed to last 
for the life of the vehicle. 

If the gaiter at the end of the steering rack is damaged, water can get into the reduction 
gear housing and therefore into the steering gear as well. That water will cause corrosion 
and, overtime, loud noises when steering. 

Nevertheless, power steering assistance from the EPS continues to be provided even in 
such cases. 

In order that large amounts of water do not remain in the steering gear(e.g. after driving 
through deep water), a water drain valve has been fitted at the lowest point of the reduc¬ 
tion gear. 

Note: If a defective bellows (boot) is discovered, it should be replaced so as to 
prevent water entering the steering gear. At the same time as replacing 
the gaiter, the water drain valve at the lowest point of the reduction gear 
should also be replaced and is included in the repair kit.

Steering Rack 

The steering rack of the EPS system has the same function as that of a hydraulic power 
steering system. 

It converts the steering force applied by the driver combined with the power steering 
assistance provided by the EPS into a force applied to the track rods. Ultimately, that 
results in steering movements by the front wheels. 

The design and dimensions of the steering rack are such that the design of the other 
vehicle components only reguired marginal adjustments in order to enable the use of 
electric power steering. 

In particular, the points of attachment to the wheels byway of the track rods and with the 
steering column are absolutely identical with those used up to now with the hydraulic 
power steering. 

The track rod also has the same gearing ratio. 

Accordingly, the gearing ratio of the steering system as a whole is identical regardless of 
the power assistance method used. 

As with hydraulic power steering systems, there is a thrust piece at the point where the 
pinion engages in the rack. It guides the rack and also serves as a means of adjusting the 
entire unit at the factory. 

The thrust piece in this EPS system acts purely as a spring mechanism without a 
hydraulic bearing. 

Note: Adjustment of the steering rack and pinion using the thrust piece is a 
once-only operation carried out during production. That adjustment 
cannot and must not be performed at a dealership!

DME Functions Used by EPS 


Intelligent Alternator Control 

With the advent of "intelligent alternator control" (IGR) on the DME as an additional 
means of C02 reduction, the alternator voltage is adjusted according to the driving 
situation and battery charge level. Therefore, there will be periods in which the electrical 
system voltage is at the level that has been normal up to now (approximately 13.8 V). 
However, there will also be situations in which the voltage drops to around or just below 
12 V. 

The EPS components, and in particular the electric motor, are rated for a power supply of 
12 V. At that level, the reguirements in terms of maximum steering power assistance and 
speed are satisfied. 

If the maximum EPS output were demanded at an alternator voltage of 12 V, the high 
current draw by the electric motor would produce a voltage drop on the EPS power 
supply line. The conseguence would be an EPS input voltage of substantially below 
12 V and, therefore, a reduced level of steering power assistance. 

In order to prevent such an undesirable situation occurring, there is an additional IGR 
function for the EPS that is implemented without additional exchange of signals with 
the EPS and comprises the following features: 

• Observation of whether an operating status exists in which high EPS output is 
reguired. 

- The bus signals indicating steering angle rate of change and road speed are 
monitored for that purpose. A high level of EPS output is identified when the 
steering angle rate of change is high at the same time as the road speed is low. 

• Action: Increase of alternator output and temporary increase of electrical system 
voltage when high EPS output is detected. 

This function ensures that the power supply at the EPS input terminals always provides 
at least the rated voltage of 12 V regardless, to a great extent, of other variables. 

Note: Detecting statuses involving high EPS output and raising the electrical 
system voltage constitute a control cycle that is completed within 2 
seconds at most. As it is also an infrequent situation, it is unlikely that 
it will be the subject of customer complaints. If a particularly observant 
customer complains of momentarily reduced power steering assistance, 
this control cycle may possibly be the cause. If there are repeated 
complaints, performing a diagnosis on the power supply is advisable. 


95 

E89 Complete Vehicle 



Speed-dependent Power Steering Assistance 

The Servotronic function that is only achievable by means of additional system complexi¬ 
ty on hydraulic steering systems is implemented in the form of software on the electric 
power steering system and is therefore available with EPS. 

The customer expects the lightest and smoothest steering movement possible when 
maneuvering or parking into spaces. Less sensitive steering setup is reguired when dri¬ 
ving at high speed so that the vehicle can be kept on course more effectively. 

Based on the sensor signals indicating the vehicle's road speed and the steering torgue 
applied by the driver, the EPS provides a high level of power steering assistance at low 
speeds and when stationary (maximum convenience). 

At high speeds on the other hand, the EPS demands greater steering force from the dri¬ 
ver by reducing the level of power steering assistance. This helps the driver to hold a con¬ 
stant line. 

As can be seen from the graph, the level of power assistance is computed on the basis 
not only of vehicle speed but also of the steering torgue applied by the driver. If the driver 
applies a small amount of turning force to the steering wheel, the assistance from the 
EPS also initially remains at a relatively low level. This produces excellent self-centering 
characteristics, i.e. the steering does not react over-sensitively from the straight-ahead 
position. 

If the driver applies greater force to the steering wheel, there is a smooth transition to a 
steeper curve gradient. As a result, the driver obtains the expected high degree of assis¬ 
tance when making abrupt steering movements or tight maneuvers. 

The characteristics described here have been adopted by the EPS from the familiar 
hydraulic steering systems. 

The transition between the curves is not abrupt but progressive. The EPS calculates 
appropriate transitional levels where necessary. 

The steering characteristics of the EPS is influenced by the driver as in other vehicles by 
pressing the driving dynamics button.

Active Steering-wheel Return 

In addition to the natural self-centering characteristics inherent in the steering and sus¬ 
pension systems, this function assists steering-wheel return by appropriate operation of 
the electric motor. 

The following signals are reguired for this purpose: 

• Road speed 

• Steering torgue applied by driver 

• Steering angle and 

• Steering angle rate of change 

However, the steering angle signal is only reguired for calibration with the electric-motor 
position sensor in order to determine the target position for steering-wheel return (steer¬ 
ing angle egual to zero). Thereafter, the active steering-wheel return function uses the 
electric-motor position sensor signal as it has a higher resolution than the steering angle 
sensor signal and thus enables more precise control. 

If the steering-angle sensor signal is not available, e.g. due to a fault on the SZL, the 
active steering-wheel return function cannot operate. The other EPS functions remain 
active. Customers may possibly describe the resulting vehicle behavior as "pulling to one 
side" because the steering wheel does not return to the straight-ahead position as pre¬ 
cisely as usual. 

The necessity for activation of the active steering-wheel return function arises when, for 
example, the driver allows the steering wheel to slip when exiting a corner. The signal val¬ 
ues reflecting that situation which the EPS uses to detect the situation are: 

• Steering angle clearly not egual to zero and 

• Steering torgue applied by driver approximately egual to zero 

The electric motor is then operated by the EPS so as to generate a return force that 
produces smooth return of the steering wheel to a position close to the straight-ahead 
position. 

Note: If a customer complains of the car "pulling to one side" the possible 

causes to be considered include not only a mechanical problem with the 
suspension/steering but also a signal or communication fault between 
the EPS and the steering column switch cluster/steering-angle sensor. 

In such a situation, the EPS is unable to provide the active steering 
wheel return function and this may be perceived by the customer as the 
vehicle "pulling to one side". 

Therefore, before checking the wheel alignment, the EPS fault memory 
should be checked and, if necessary, the stored testing sequence fol¬ 
lowed in order to make certain the signal from the steering-angle sensor 
is present.

The clearly perceptible improvement compared with the self-centering characteristics of 
hydraulic power steering systems is evident from the graph below. 

The electric power steering returns to the center position more dynamically and 
precisely. This applies to all electric power steering systems used by BMW because 
they all incorporate the active steering-wheel return function. 

The self-centering characteristics of an EPS system without active steering wheel return 
shown on the graph are for comparison purposes only. They reveal themselves to be 
inferior to those of a hydraulic power steering system. This is due to the greater inertia 
of the electric motor and reduction gearing. 

However, all EPS systems used by BMW incorporate active steering-wheel return and 
therefore offer the benefits described above.

Active Damping 

The undesirable steering-wheel movements to be damped can be produced either by 
inadvertent steering input by the driver or feedback from the road/roadwheels. 

Damping Roadwheel Feedback 

The design of the front suspension (double link Macpherson strut suspension) on its own 
ensures that vertical wheel movements produce very little lateral force on the track rods. 

Due to the low ratio of the reduction gear by which the electric motor is connected to the 
steering rack, the inertia of the electric motor also has a damping effect on the forces and 
movements transmitted from the roadwheels to the steering wheel. Those mechanical 
damping effects are supplemented by an electronic damping function on the part of the 
EPS. It analyses the movements of the steering rack (using the signals from the electric- 
motor position sensor) and operates the electric motor accordingly in response. 

This means that feedback from external forces is transmitted in controlled amounts to the 
steering wheel so that, on the one hand, the driver obtains sufficient information about 
the nature of the road surface, but on the other, undesirably extreme steering wheel back¬ 
lash is prevented. 

Damping Steering Input from Driver 

Particularly at high speeds, unintentional jerky movements of the steering wheel by the 
driver have a negative effect on vehicle handling stability. So-called "snatching" of the 
steering wheel can, under certain circumstances, cause the vehicle to start rocking, which 
can lead to snaking and the driver ultimately losing control of the vehicle if corrective 
action is not taken quickly enough. 

The EPS detects such steering input and operates the electric motor so as to substan¬ 
tially damp the movements, particularly at high speeds. As a result, vehicle rocking is pre¬ 
vented.

Damping of Steering Input by EPS 



100 

E89 Complete Vehicle 













































Active Roadwheel Feedback 

Partly due to the damping effect of the inertia of the electric motor, an EPS system can 
inherently not provide as direct feedback about the nature of the road surface as a 
hydraulic power steering system. 

In order to obtain virtually identical roadwheel feedback characteristics on vehicles with 
EPS, the EPS analyses information that describes the vehicle's dynamic handling situa¬ 
tion. From that information, the EPS computes additional "EPS road surface data". As a 
result, the driver obtains better roadwheel feedback characteristics which are very similar 
to those of a hydraulic power steering system. 

Control 

The EPS status control function makes the overriding decision as to whether operation of 
the electric motor is permissible or not. It produces a clearance signal that is sent to the 
EPS function that is co-ordinating the subordinate specified settings of the control and 
modulation functions. 

The conditions for allowing operation are the following: 

• Ignition must be switched on 

• Engine must be running 

• There must be no EPS input signal faults or EPS internal faults present 
The response to detected faults described below represents an exception. 


101 

E89 Complete Vehicle 



Status Shutdown in the Event of Faults 

A primary aim in the development of the EPS was to ensure that vehicle response in the 
event of faults would remain manageable by the driver. Therefore, under no circum¬ 
stances must a sudden high steering force in either direction be allowed to occur. For that 
reason, the EPS has numerous monitoring functions for detecting faults on the sensors, 
actuators and associated systems that are involved in EPS operation. 

All fault statuses in which reliable and correct control of the electric motor is not possible 
result in the disabling of motor operation and, therefore, shutdown of the EPS functions. 

The conseguence of that is that the driver no longer benefits from the convenience of 
power-assisted steering. More importantly, however, incorrect control of the electric 
motor is prevented. 

Note: The loss of power steering assistance in the event of faults constitutes 
an intended system response on the part of the EPS. 

Although such a response may be slightly unnerving for the driver, the 
vehicle remains fully steerable with greater physical effort. 

Loss of power steering assistance in the event of faults occurs both with electric and 
hydraulic power steering. The two systems thus also behave in a similar manner in 
response to faults. 

In such a fault situation, a yellow warning lamp lights up on the instrument 
cluster. The driver is also notified of the fact that power steering assistance 
from the EPS is no longer available by display of the appropriate Check 
Control symbol together with the explanatory message on the Central 
Information Display. 



102 

E89 Complete Vehicle 



Co-ordination of Specified Settings 

The specified settings for the control and modulation functions for operating the electric 
motor are co-ordinated at a central point by the EPS software. If a clearance signal from 
the status control function is present, the individual specified settings are normally added 
together and signalled as a total value. 

In certain transitional situations the specified settings are filtered before they are signalled. 
The following are examples of such cases: 

• The EPS goes into operation after the engine is started. The power assistance 
torgue is increased progressively until the desired level is reached. 

• The EPS reduces the power steering assistance for function-related reasons (see 
also the section "Supplementary functions"). 

In the event of a fault the control signal for the electric motor is abruptly cancelled instead 
of being filtered in order to prevent incorrect operation as guickly as possible. 

Supplementary Functions 

The functions described below are encountered only rarely in special operating situa¬ 
tions. The information given here can help to distinguish those special operating statuses, 
which do not reguire repairs, from genuine faults when handling complaints from cus¬ 
tomers. 

Protection Against Overload 

The EPS reduces the degree of power steering assistance if the temperature of EPS 
components becomes too high. By limiting motor operation, the amount of heat generat¬ 
ed by the EPS itself is also limited, thereby protecting the components against excessive 
thermal stress. 

This action starts to come into effect from a temperature of approximately 100°C and 
escalates to the point where power steering assistance is reduced to zero at a tempera¬ 
ture of 115°C. 

Upwards of a certain degree of function restriction, the warning light on the instrument 
cluster is switched on (see the section "Shutdown in the event of faults") and a fault reg¬ 
istered in the fault memory. 

In addition to reducing power steering assistance, the EPS also reguests higher electric 
fan output from the DME in order to produce a greater cooling effect. 

This type of overload can occur at high ambient temperatures combined with simultane¬ 
ous high degrees of steering activity, especially when stationary. 

Another overload situation can occur if an attempt is made to turn the front wheels 
against a solid obstacle (e.g. a kerbstone). If this situation occurs repeatedly at short inter¬ 
vals, the degree of power steering assistance is similarly reduced. This firstly protects the 
EPS components against excessive mechanical stresses, and secondly signals to the dri¬ 
ver that there is a solid object preventing the wheels turning.

The EPS detects such situations by comparing the control signals to the electric motor 
with the motion of the motor. 

Note: The EPS reduces the power steering assistance in overload situations. If 
customer complaints are received, the customer should be questioned 
as to the situation in which the symptoms occurred before commencing 
any repair work. 

If necessary enlighten the customer as to the way in which these protec¬ 
tive functions operate. 

End Stop as Software Function 

Although the EPS steering gear also incorporates mechanical end stops, there is afunc- 
tion that steeply reduces the level of power assistance shortly before the mechanical end 
stops are reached. Although the driver will perceive this as increased steering resistance, 
it makes turning the wheels to full lock much smoother overall. 

In addition, this function reduces the stresses on mechanical and electrical components 
of the steering system and thus contributes to the achievement of long service life com¬ 
bined with reliable operation.

Service Information 


Brakes 

For safety reasons, the parking brake cannot be activated for as long as the EMF control 
unit is in installation mode. If the EMF button is pulled, the EMF indicator lamp in the 
instrument cluster will flash yellow. 

The exact procedure for bedding-in the service brakes is described in the Repair 
Instructions. The instructions must be followed exactly. 

Adaptive M Chassis and Suspension 

For standardization reasons, the continuous electronic damper control on the E89 is 
simply referred to as EDC. 

A detailed functional description of the EDC van be found in Background Material E65 
Dynamic Driving Systems from April 2001. 

Dynamic Driving Systems 

Cruise control with brake function is described in detail in the Participant’s Manual E90 
Dynamic Driving Systems. 

Dynamic driving switch 

The yellow DSC indicator and warning lamp and the DTC button have new symbols. 
Beginning with the F01/F02, these new DSC symbols will replace those previously used. 

Replacing an EPS System 

The EPS components consisting of steering torque sensor, EPS control module unit, 
electric motor with position sensor, reduction gear and steering rack form a single unit 
(often referred to as "EPS steering rack assembly") that can only be replaced as a com¬ 
plete unit. To do so, the unit has to be disconnected from the track rods and the lower 
end of the steering column. 

After a new EPS steering rack is fitted, a front wheel and tracking alignment check is 
required. The commissioning sequence involves coding the EPS to match the vehicle 
model and the diagnosis function for learning the end-stop positions. 

Intelligent Alternator Control and EPS 

Detecting statuses involving high EPS output and raising the electrical system voltage 
constitute a control cycle that is completed within 2 seconds at most. As it is also an 
infrequent situation, it is unlikely that it will be the subject of customer complaints.

If a particularly observant customer complains of momentarily reduced power steering 
assistance, this control cycle may possibly be the cause. If there are repeated complaints, 
performing a diagnosis on the power supply is advisable. 

Active Steering Wheel Reset 

If a customer complains of the car "pulling to one side" the possible causes to be consid¬ 
ered include not only a mechanical problem with the suspension/steering but also a sig¬ 
nal or communication fault between the EPS and the steering column switch clus¬ 
ter/steering-angle sensor. In such a situation, the EPS is unable to provide the active 
steering wheel return function and this may be perceived by the customer as the vehicle 
"pulling to one side". 

Therefore, before checking the wheel alignment, the EPS fault memory should be 
checked and, if necessary, the stored testing sequence followed in order to make certain 
the signal from the steering-angle sensor is present. 

Protection Against Overload 

The EPS reduces the power steering assistance in overload situations. If customer com¬ 
plaints are received, the customer should be questioned as to the situation in which the 
symptoms occurred before commencing any repair work. 

If necessary enlighten the customer as to the way in which these protective functions 
operate. 

Shutdown in the Event of Faults 

The loss of power steering assistance in the event of faults constitutes an intended sys¬ 
tem response on the part of the EPS. 

Although such a response may be slightly unnerving for the driver, the vehicle remains 
fully steerable with greater physical effort. 

Electrical Connections 

If the EPS steering rack assembly has to be replaced, only the power supply and bus 
connection have to be disconnected and not the connection for the steering torque sen¬ 
sor. 

If a customer complains of inadequate power steering assistance, it can be due to a volt¬ 
age drop across the power supply connection. 

Therefore, in such cases the power supply connection should be checked for corrosion.

Step-down Gear 

If a defective gaiter is discovered, it should be replaced so as to prevent water entering 
the steering gear. At the same time as replacing the gaiter, the water drain valve at the 
lowest point of the reduction gear should also be replaced and is included in the repair 
kit. 

Corrosion on the moving parts of the steering gear does not normally result in heavy 
steering. Instead, corrosion is freguently a cause of noises from the steering mechanism. 

If customers complain of loud steering noises and if they are definitely attributable to the 
EPS steering rack, the complete EPS steering rack assembly must be replaced.
