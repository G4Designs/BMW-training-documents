History 

Z8 (E52) Complete Vehicle 

The father of the Z8 is considered to be the legendary 507. Series 1 and Series 2 of the 
507 were produced from November 1956 to March 1959. 43 Series 1 vehicles were pro¬ 
duced and 209 Series 2 (shown below). 

The vehicle was built on a box-section frame with frame side members and tubular cross 
members. The body was made of light alloy material. 

The V8 engine boasted 3.2 litre displacement and 150 DIN bhp at 5000 rpm. Acceleration 
from 0 to 100 km/h was between 8 and 10 seconds depending on the axle transmission 
ratio. The specified top speed was 220 km/h. The 507 had a curb weight of 1220 kg. 

The 507 was aimed at the sporty sections of elite society. In 1958 (Series 2) the vehicle cost 
was 29,950.00 DM.

HISTORY/E52 




Introduction 


The Z8 is a two-seater sports car fol¬ 
lowing the tradition of the 507. The 
vehicle design is a combination of clas¬ 
sic style elements and modern BMW 
technology. 


The complete body of the Z8 is made of 
aluminum. The body is produced in the 
Dingolfing plant and the vehicle is then 
finished built as a limited production in 
Munich plant. 



The Z8 is designed as a classic roadster 
featuring a long hood, short overhang, 
rear-wheel drive and a soft top. Clearly 
seen above and right, it also features 
design elements typical of BMW road¬ 
sters such as the standard grilles on the 
front fenders. 


Typical for a roadster, the interior is both 
compact while at the same time setting 
new design standards.
