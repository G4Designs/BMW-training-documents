Body Shell 

Purpose of the System 

• The aim of BMW development was to achieve a high degree of rigidity in 
combination with low weight. This objective was achieved by using aluminum 
in a space frame design. 

• The body of the Z8 roadster has been developed as a solid aluminum structure 
that combines an aluminum space frame with bolt on aluminum outer skin paneling. 
This design therefore renders necessary repair methods specific to aluminum. 

• The aluminum outer skin panel consists of aluminum-magnesium-silicon alloy. 
The body framework is made up of extruded sections. The entire frame work has a 
weight of 225kg (496 lbs.). 

• The bodyshell of the Z8 consists of a total of 287 parts, of which 87 parts 
are extruded sections. 

Factors of the outstanding rigity of the Z8:

Components 

Frame - Structural Views 


The side and top view shown to 
the right reveals the formation of 
the frame “Y” structure. 

The “Y” structure enhances 
strength in the Z8 application. 

The depth of the side rail adds to 
the center strength, as well as 
accomodating the floor pan. 





Using the “Y” structure provides 
the additional strength needed to 
compensate for the lack of a roof 
(open roadster). 

The transmission tunnel is also a 
critical frame rail structure. 

This method of construction pro¬ 
vides two additional frame rails 
for center support which 
enhances structural rigidity. 

The illustration on the right high¬ 
lights the triangulation pieces that 
reinforce the “Y” structure.

The frame and floor pan assem¬ 
bly illustration on the right 
shows additional triangulation 
reinforcement pieces. 

The rear support beam provides 
additional floor pan support as 
well as torsional rigidity. 



Shown on the right is the wind¬ 
shield frame structural mount¬ 
ing and engine compartment 
bulkhead assembly.

Bodyshell/E52 













The aluminum “space frame” 
with joint connection is high¬ 
lighted on the right. 

To offer support for the front 
“clip” to the engine compart¬ 
ment bulkhead (preventing 
upward flex), the frame with a 
joint connection is used. 


Critical in race car construc¬ 
tion for strength and rigidity is 
the use of “triangulation”. 



The left front frame with joint 
connection (actual) is shown 
here on the right. 

Triangulation can clearly be 
seen here to reinforce the 
upper front “clip” rails which 
support the strut towers. 


This type of reinforcing pro¬ 
vides excellent support for the 
aluminum frame.

Bodyshell/E52 









The front structure illustration 
on the right highlights the addi¬ 
tional frame support behind 
the front bumper assembly. 

The mounting points for the 
bumper impact absorbers can 
be seen here. 



The engine compartment 
structure shown in this actual 
view reveals the massive frame 
rail size. 



Bodyshell/E52 









The aluminum strut tower 
structure can be seen here on 
the right which is supported by 
two channel braces that con¬ 
nect with the upper support rail. 

This method of construction 
reduces weight in the inner 
fender well area. 

An additional strengthening 
plate for the frame rail is visible 
here. 



The left rear floor section 
shown here reveals the inner 
frame rail mounting to the rear 
support beam. 

The roll bar supports are inte¬ 
gral in the main structure.

rear strut tower support and 
the integral roll bar mount¬ 
ing. 



The left rear frame structure 
shown on the right highlights 
the upswept rear frame rail 
and the mounting point for 
the rear impact absorber.

The luggage compartment view 
on the right reveals the spacious 
trunk. 

The fuel tank (731) is forward 
mounted in this compartment. 

Also shown is the massive rear 
support structure and mounting 
for the bumper impact 
absorbers. 



The luggage compartment floor 
insert is a bolt in plastic tray that 
holds the battery, tool kit, and 
antenna amplifier. 

The view on the right also shows 
the BST cable and high amp 
fuses.

Components 

Body - Panel Views 


The outer “skin” body panels are 
all bolt on, minimizing repair time 
and cost. 

The picture on the right repre¬ 
sents the entire body shell and 
frame structure assembly. 



In addition to the bolt on 
panels shown in this illus¬ 
tration, compound outer 
panels such as door, hood, 
and trunk skins are bonded 
to their support frames.

The illustration on the right is the 
integrated flexible front bumper 
assembly. 

Notice the impact absorbers are 
not shown, but they mount to 
the structural support and into 
the frame rails. 



Pull out (unsnap) the grille panel 
to access the tow hook mount¬ 
ing point. 


The threaded tow hook is stored 
in the tool kit. 

Shown on the right is the instal¬ 
lation position.

The rear bumper assembly with 
heat insulators is shown to the 
right. The AM/FM/ Telephone 
antenna is located across the 
flexible panel. 


Notice the impact absorbers are 
not shown, but they mount the 
rear bumper assembly to the 
rear frame rails. 


The exhaust tips are attached to 
the rear bumper assembly. 



To access the rear tow hook 
mounting, push on release tab of 
the split reflective lens as indicat¬ 
ed in this picture. 

The threaded tow hook is locat¬ 
ed in the tool kit. 


The exhaust tip can also be seen 
here which is attatched to the 
bumper assembly.

Rollbar 


The fixed rollbars are made of high strength extruded aluminum sections. 

The rollbar is fitted in a sleeve, to which it is insulated by a cushion of vulcanized material. 

This vulcanized material can deform under heavy load allowing the rollbar to move within a 
predetermined range. Therefore; the rollbar can reduce forces to the head in the event of a 
rear end collision. 

To ensure the body mounts are not damaged by the very firm rollbar under extreme load, 
the rollbar features defined deformation points at which it can kink without sheering.

The rollbar is connected to the body mount by a sleeve.

Rollbar Mounting 


To remove the roll bars, gently slide the 
chrome base covers up as shown on the 
right. Unsnap the cover panel from the top 
and fold down to remove. 


Remove the mounting bolts, four 10 mm 
on the outside (shown on the right), and 
one 13 mm on the inside (shown below), 
of the roll bars. 



The roll bar has been removed from the 
mounting sleeves to allow visibility of the 
single mounting bolt on the right, and the 
four bolt locating plate on the left. 

Note: The mounting bolts exert a certain 
force (determined by the tightening 
torque) on the extruded section of the roll- 
bar. Be sure to engage the pins on the 
locating plate in the roll bar before fighting.

Repair Concept 

• The Z8 requires special attention when body repair is needed due to the all 
aluminum construction. It is important to note that body repair methods on 
aluminum widely differ from those methods used on steel. 

• Please, review the following information on Repair Concept and share the 
information with other BMW Center personnel. This information reflects 
engineering and design, repair work in general, and our recommendation 
for implementation. 


• With consideration for engineering, repair equipment availability, quality 
requirements, know how, investment outlay, three levels of repair are outlined: 


Level 1 - “light duty’’ repair: scratches 

dents 

bolt on panel replacement 
paint work 

Level 2 - “medium duty” repair: frame rail sectioning 

the use of epoxy bonding and riveting 
repairs requiring frame/body fixtures 
repairs requiring dimensioning tools 


Level 3 - “heavy duty” repair: frame rail replacement 

structural panel/support replacement 
repairs requiring welding 

repairs requiring the use of frame/body fixture tools 
level 2 and 3 require specific tools, equipment, and training 


16 

Module Name/E52 



Implementation 

Level 1 is straight forward and can be performed by a competent BMW body repair 
facility, or BMW approved sublet partner repair facility. 

Due to the complexity, skill, tools and equipment required for Level 2 and 3 repairs it is 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to have the vehicle repaired at one of the BMW 
authorized repair centers: 

BMW of North America, Inc. 

Montvale, NJ 

BMW Performance Center 
Greer, SC 

BMW of North America, Inc. 

Oxnard, CA 

Quality repairs are need to maintain sound structural integrity and value 
preservation of the Z8 as well as all other BMWs. 

The locations listed above are recommended as they have the specialized 
equipment required and factory collision repair technicians, possessing the skill 
need to perform proper Z8 repairs. 


Please, refer to any Aftersales announcements such as the Service Information 
Bulletins for outlined specific details.
