Convertible Top 

Purpose of The System 

The Z8 Convertible top is a semi-automatic electro-hydraulic system that opens and clos¬ 
es the soft top using hydraulic cylinders and an electric motor. It consist of the convertible 
module (CVM) which monitors and controls the complete operation of the soft top system. 
The CVM interacts with the General Module which controls the window operation when 
lowering or raising the soft top. A hard top is standard equipment. 

Convertible Top Features 

• Electro/Hydraulic Operation 

• Servo Assisted Electric Lock 

• Flexible, Easy to Replace Rear Window (Zip Out) 

• Inner Headliner 

• Emergency Operation

Top Construction 

Top and Frame 


The convertible top consists of 
three layers : 

The outer layer is fabric with a 
replaceable (zip-out) rear win¬ 
dow. 

A middle fleece liner is 

installed between the fabric 
and inner liner for sound and 
weather insulating purposes. 


To assist the frame in tension¬ 
ing when the top is closed, 
the top has tensioning straps 
and cables for additional sup¬ 
port, which is indicated by the 
arrows on the right. 

The inner liner is similar to 
the E46iC and is attached to 
the top frame so that it 
stretches tight when the top is 
closed. 

The pull handle with integral 
Hall sensor which is (required 
for the final closing procedure) 
is also shown on the right.

Underneath the fabric, the front bow houses the 
latching assembly. This assembly consists of a drive 
motor, closing handle (hall sensor) and two 
mechanical latches. The right hand latch consist 
of three hall sensors.

Pre-Conditions for Soft Top Operation 

• Ignition switched on 

• Vehicle stationary (0 road speed) 

• Switch must be continually pressed 


Procedure To Open The Top 


Press and hold convertible top switch to "open 
Windshield latch is released automatically 
The side windows are lowered (via K-bus to GM V) 



The convertible top is lowered into the convertible top compartment 
Sound system is automatically equalized (road noise compensation) 
Windows will raise if the switch is continually pressed after the top is stored 


Procedure To Close The Top 

• Press and hold convertible top button to "close" 

• The side windows are lowered (via K-bus to GM V) 

• The convertible top is raised out of the convertible top compartment 

• Release "close" convertible top button 

• Squeeze/pull the recessed handle (windshield latches lock the bow) 

• Windows will raise if the squeeze/pull handle is continually pressed after the top is raised

Hydraulic Unit 


The hydraulic unit is a self con¬ 
tained unit with a sealed reser¬ 
voir that is sleeved around the 
pump assembly. 

The end of the hydraulic unit 
contains a distribution block 
where the hydraulic lines are fit¬ 
ted. 

The hydraulic unit is located in 
the left rear fender well. 

The pump motor is controlled 
by the CVM III. 

The CVM III simply reverses the 
polarity (through the relays) to 
reverse the pump motor opera¬ 
tion. 


Hydraulic Cylinders 

The convertible top is operated 
by two hydraulic cylinders 
(which reduces stress from the 
top frame). 

They are located behind each 
seat under the rear interior trim 
panels. 

The hydraulic lines are routed 
into the body behind the dri¬ 
ver’s seat.

Electrical Operation 

Top Operation 

The convertible top operation is controlled by the Convertible Top Module (CVM III). The 
control switch is located in the center console, next to the shift handle. During operation 
the convertible top warning light will be “on”. If the top is stopped in mid operation, or if 
a fault occurs, the warning light will “flash”. The top will not operate if there is road speed 
present. 

Top Lowering Sequence 

Top Switch Pressed “Open” 

• The CVM activates the latching drive motor, which releases and open the latches. 

• The latch hall sensor confirms the release of the latches by sending a signal 
to the CVM. 

• The CVM signals the GM to lower the windows (if closed) for approx. 1.5 sec. 

• The CVM activates the pump motor relay (1) and the hydraulic pump pressurizes the 
hydraulic cylinders to pull the soft top open. 

• The soft top will then be folded into the storage compartment. 

• When the soft top is in the storage compartment, the Top-down hall sensor 
signals the CVM to deactivate the hydraulic pump. 

• The CVM will then activate the latching drive motor to “fold in” the latches. 

Top Raising Sequence 

Top Switch Pressed “Closed” 

• The CVM activates the latching drive motor, which releases and opens the latches. 

• The latch hall sensor confirms the release of the latches by sending a signal to 
the CVM. 

• The CVM activates the pump motor relay (2) and the hydraulic pump runs in the 
reverse direction, pressurizing the hydraulic cylinders to raise the soft top frame. 

• The soft top is raised to the point that the Top-up hall sensor signals the CVM 
to stop the pump motor. 

• At this point the soft top is slightly open, the driver must reach into the 
recessed handle and squeeze and pull down at the same time. 

• The pull handle hall sensor will trigger the CVM to activate the latching drive motor to 
lock the top frame/bow to the windshield frame.

Emergency Closing Operation 

• In the event of an electric/hydraulic malfunction, the top can be raised manually 

• To raise the top, the bow latches must be released 

• Remove the access cover from the inner bow cover, and using the tool from the tool 


kit, manually crank the bow latches open. 



• Once the latches have been fully released, the top can be manually raised 

(the latches will then need to be manually latched) - a slight bleed off time is required 

• The convertible top can not be manually lowered 

• This system does not require an initialization after the emergency procedure has been 
performed

Review Questions 


1. In the event of a malfunction, how is the convertible top manually raised? 


2. What hydraulic components are used for the convertible top operation? 


3. What other systems interact with the CVM and why?
