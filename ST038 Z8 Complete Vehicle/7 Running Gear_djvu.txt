RUNNING GEAR 


Model: E52 

Production Date: 03/00 


Objectives of the Module 

After completing this module, you should be able to: 

• To identify which suspension components are aluminum on the Z8. 

• To list the spring and sway specification increases for handling. 

• To describe the braking system enhancements.

Front Axle 


The Z8 front suspension is designed as a dou¬ 
ble pivot with spring over strut. 


The axle principle of the E39 and E38 models 
has been re-engineered in order to achieve 
the desired sports and roadster-specific char¬ 
acteristics. 

The front axle carrier is a welded aluminum 
structure consisting of extruded sections 
and reinforcement panels. 

The front axle carrier is connected to the body 
by 6 bolted points. 

The tension struts are also forged aluminum. 



Hydraulic rubber mounts have been installed 
(tension rod bushings) in order to reduce axle 
vibration. 


The struts are clamped to the spindle hub 
unit. 

The upper pivot bearings (plates) are made of 
aluminum. 

Suspension 

The front struts are equipped with gas 
pressure shock absorbers. 

The spring tuning is approx. 18% stiffer 
than on sedans. Due to the harder spring 
tuning, the spring compression range is 
70 mm. 

The anti-sway bar is 27 mm in diameter. 
This suspension design allows a low hood line 
to be achieved.

Steering 

The Z8 is equipped with power assisted 
rack and pinion steering. 

The steering gear is located in front of the 
wheel center and subframe cross mem¬ 
ber. This combination ensures correct 
steering characteristics and steering line 
accuracy. 

The variable ratio of the steering gear 
provides a responsive feel under all driv¬ 
ing conditions. 

The Z8 is not equipped with Servotronic. 

Rear Axle 

The concept of the Z8 rear axle is known 
from the E38. The rear axle carrier is made 
of steel, similar to the carrier installed in 
the E38. 

The rear axle is connected to the body by 
large-volume rubber mounts. Ball bearings 
are used in the lower control arm pivots, 
allowing for the hard longitudinal and 
transverse acceleration forces. 

Suspension 

Struts with centrally positioned springs are 
fitted on the rear axle. 

The spring tuning is approx. 25% 
harder than on the E38 sedan. The 
spring compression range is 80 mm. 

A 14 mm diameter anti-sway bar is 
standard.

Brakes 

• The Z8 features a 2-circuit vacuum boosted brake system with a front/back split 
arrangement. The brake system has been adopted and modified from the E38 
security vehicle. 

• The front brakes are designed as a dual-piston floating calipers, and the rear 
brakes are single-piston floating calipers. 

• The rotors feature a special coating (Geomet), improving corrosion resistance.

• Only run flat tires are used with emergency running characteristics (refer to after sales 
publications for details). 

• The Z8 is not equipped with a spare tire or M-mobility kit. 

The DWS tire pressure warning system is standard. This system has a new acronym on 
the Z8, but is based on the RDW from the E39 M5. For specific details refer to the 
ST037 M5 handout.
