History 

Z8 (E52) Complete Vehicle 

The father of the Z8 is considered to be the legendary 507. Series 1 and Series 2 of the 
507 were produced from November 1956 to March 1959. 43 Series 1 vehicles were pro¬ 
duced and 209 Series 2 {shown below). 



___ 


■HUP . 1 





The vehicle was built on a box-section frame with frame side members and tubular cross 
members. The body was made of light alloy material. 

The V8 engine boasted 3.2 litre displacement and 150 DIN bhp at 5000 rpm. Acceleration 
from 0 to 100 km/h was between 8 and 10 seconds depending on the axle transmission 
ratio. Tine specified top speed was 220 km/h. The 507 had a curb weight of 1220 kg. 

The 507 was aimed at the sporty sections of elite society. In 1958 {Series 2) the vehicle cost 
was 29,950.00 DM.

Introduction 

The Z8 is a two-seater sports car fol¬ 
lowing the tradition of the 507. The 
vehicle design is a combination of clas¬ 
sic style elements and modern BMW 
technology. 


The complete body of the Z8 is made of 
aluminum. The body is produced in the 
Dingolfing plant and the vehicle is then 
finished built as a limited production in 
Munich plant. 



The Z8 is designed as a classic roadster 
featuring a long hood, short overhang, 
rear-wheel drive and a soft top. Clearly 
seen above and right, it also features 
design elements typical of BMW road¬ 
sters such as the standard grilles on the 
front fenders. 


Typical for a roadster, the interior is both 
compact while at the same time setting 
new design standards.

Body Shell 

Purpose of the System 

• The aim of BMW development was to achieve a high degree of rigidity in 
combination with low weight. This objective was achieved by using aluminum 
in a space frame design. 

• The body of the 28 roadster has been developed as a solid aluminum structure 
that combines an aluminum space frame with bolt on aluminum outer skin paneling. 
This design therefore renders necessary repair methods specific to aluminum. 

• The aluminum outer skin panel consists of aluminum-magnesium-silicon alloy. 
The body framework is made up of extruded sections. The entire frame work has a 
weight of 225kg (496 lbs.). 

• The bodyshell of the Z8 consists of a total of 287 parts, of which 87 parts 
are extruded sections. 

Factors of the outstanding rigity of the Z8: 


The fastest way to a convertible: head off 


coupe root off! convertible 



The best way to a convertible: use head 


coupe 


roof down! convertible 



0^-0 


Optimization of the tunnel frame structure means: 


Straight-ahead driving: good good 

Bumps: good good 

Cornering: poor good 

Torsion: poor good 

Longitudinal rigity: poor good 



The aluminum space frame structure of the 28 was evolved from this

Frame - Structural Views 


The side and top view shown to 
the right reveals the formation of 
the frame “Y" structure. 

The “Y” structure enhances 
strength in the Z8 application. 

The depth of the side rail adds to 
the center strength, as well as 
accomodating the floor pan. 





i r. •i 




Using the “Y” structure provides 
the additional strength needed to 
compensate for the lack of a roof 
(open roadster). 

The transmission tunnel is also a 
critical frame rail structure. 

This method of construction pro¬ 
vides two additional frame rails 
for center support which 
enhances structural rigidity. 

The illustration on the right high¬ 
lights the triangulation pieces that 
reinforce the “Y” structure.

Triangulation can clearly be 
seen here to reinforce the 
upper front “clip" rails which 
support the strut towers. 


This type of reinforcing pro¬ 
vides excellent support for the 
aluminum frame. 


The aluminum “space frame” 
with joint connection is high¬ 
lighted on the right. 


To offer support for the front 
“clip” to the engine compart¬ 
ment bulkhead (preventing 
upward flex), the frame with a 
joint connection is used. 


Critical in race car construc¬ 
tion for strength and rigidity is 
the use of “triangulation”.

Rollbar 


he fixed rollbars are made of high strength extruded aluminum sections. 

" he rollbar is fitted in a sleeve, to which it is insulated by a cushion of vulcanized material. 

This vulcanized material can deform under heavy load allowing the rollbar to move within a 
predetermined range. Therefore; the rollbar can reduce forces to the head in the event of a 
rear end collision. 

To ensure the body mounts are not damaged by the very firm rollbar under extreme load, 
the rollbar features defined deformation points at which it can kink without sheering.

Rollbar Mounting 

To remove the roll bars, gently slide the 
chrome base covers up as shown on the 
right. Unsnap the cover panel from the top 
and fold down to remove. 


Remove the mounting bolts, four 10 mm 
on the outside (shown on the right), and 
one 13 mm on the inside (shown below), 
of the roll bars. 






The roll bar has been removed from the 
mounting sleeves to allow visibility of the 
single mounting bolt on the right, and the 
four bolt locating plate on the left. 

Note: The mounting bolts exert a certain 
force (determined by the tightening 
torque) on the extruded section of the roll- 
bar. Be sure to engage the pins on the 
locating plate in the roil bar before fighting.

Repair Concept 


• The Z8 requires special attention when body repair is needed due to the all 
aluminum construction. It is important to note that body repair methods on 
aluminum widely differ from those methods used on steel. 

• Please, review the following information on Repair Concept and share the 
information with other BMW Center personnel. This information reflects 
engineering and design, repair work in general, and our recommendation 
for implementation. 


• With consideration for engineering, repair equipment availability, quality 
requirements, know how, investment outlay, three levels of repair are outlined: 

Level 1 - “light duty" repair scratches 

dents 

bolt on panel replacement 
paint work 

Level 2 - “medium duty” repair: frame rail sectioning 

the use of epoxy bonding and riveting 
repairs requiring frame/body fixtures 
repairs requiring dimensioning tools 


Level 3 - "heavy duty” repair: frame rail replacement 

structural panel/support replacement 
repairs requiring welding 

repairs requiring the use of frame/body fixture tools 
’level 2 and 3 require specific tools, equipment, and training 


16 

Module Name/E52 







Implementation 

Level 1 is straight forward and can be performed by a competent BMW body repair 
facility, or BMW approved sublet partner repair facility. 

Due to the complexity, skill, tools and equipment required for Level 2 and 3 repairs it is 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to have the vehicle repaired at one of the BMW 
authorized repair centers: 

BMW of North America, Inc. 

Montvale, NJ 

BMW Performance Center 
Greer, SC 

BMW of North America, Inc. 

Oxnard, CA 

Quality repairs are need to maintain sound structural integrity and value 
preservation of the Z8 as well as all other BMWs. 

The locations listed above are recommended as they have the specialized 
equipment required and factory collision repair technicians, possessing the skill 
need to perform proper Z8 repairs. 


Please, refer to any Aftersales announcements such as the Service Information 
Bulletins for outlined specific details.

Top Construction 



Top and Frame 

The convertible top consists of 
three layers: 

The outer layer is fabric with a 
replaceable (zip-out) rear win¬ 
dow. 

A middle fleece liner is 
installed between the fabric 
and inner liner for sound and 
weather insulating purposes. 


To assist the frame in tension¬ 
ing when the top is closed, 
the top has tensioning straps 
and cables for additional sup¬ 
port, which is indicated by the 
arrows on the right. 

The inner liner is similar to 
the E46iC and is attached to 
the top frame so that it 
stretches tight when the top is 
closed. 

"he pull handle with integral 
Hall sensor which is (required 
for the final closing procedure) 
is also shown on the right.

tained unit with a sealed reser¬ 
voir that is sleeved around the 
pump assembly. 

1 he end of the hydraulic unit 
contains a distribution block 
where the hydraulic lines are fit¬ 
ted. 

The hydraulic unit is located in 
the left rear fender well. 

The pump motor is controlled 
by the CVM III. 

The CVM III simply reverses the 
polarity (through the relays) to 
reverse the pump motor opera¬ 
tion. 


Hydraulic Cylinders 

The convertible top is operated 
by two hydraulic cylinders 
(which reduces stress from the 
top frame). 

They are located behind each 
seat under the rear interior trim 
panels. 

The hydraulic lines are routed 
into the body behind the dri¬ 
ver's seat.

Electrical Operation 


Top Operation 

The convertible top operation is controlled by the Convertible Top Module (CVM III). The 
control switch is located in the center console, next to the shift handle. During operation 
the convertible top warning light will be “on". If the top is stopped in mid operation, or if 
a fault occurs, the warning light will “flash". The top will not operate if there is road speed 
present. 


Top Lowering Sequence 

Top Switch Pressed “Open" 

• he CVM activates the latching drive motor, which releases and open the latches. 

• The latch hall sensor confirms the release of the latches by sending a signal 
to the CVM. 

• The CVM signals the GM to lower the windows (if closed) for approx. 1.5 sec. 

• The CVM activates the pump motor relay (1) and the hydraulic pump pressurizes the 
hydraulic cylinders to pull the soft top open. 

• The soft top will then be folded into the storage compartment. 

• When the soft top is in the storage compartment, the Top-down hall sensor 
signals the CVM to deactivate the hydraulic pump. 

• The CVM will then activate the latching drive motor to “fold in" the latches. 

Top Raising Sequence 

Top Switch Pressed "Closed” 

• The CVM activates the latching drive motor, which releases and opens the latches. 

• The latch hall sensor confirms the release of the latches by sending a signal to 
the CVM. 

• The CVM activates the pump motor relay (2) and the hydraulic pump runs in the 
reverse direction, pressurizing the hydraulic cylinders to raise the soft top frame. 

• The soft top is raised to the point that the Top-up hall sensor signals the CVM 
to stop the pump motor. 

• At this point the soft top is slightly open, the driver must reach into the 
recessed handle and squeeze and pull down at the same time. 

• The pull handle hall sensor will trigger the CVM to activate the latching drive motor to 
lock the top frame/bow to the windshield frame.

Convertible Top/E52 


Emergency Closing Operation 

• In the event of an electric/hydraulic malfunction, the top can be raised manually 

• To raise the top, the bow latches must be released 




• Remove the access cover from the inner bow cover, and using the tool from the tool 
kit, manually crank the bow latches open. 










Once the latches have been fully released, the top can be manually raised 

(the latches will then need to be manually latched) - a slight bleed off time is required 


• The convertible top can not be manually lowered 


• This system does not require an initialization after the emergency procedure has been 
performed

Instrument Cluster 

Purpose of the System 

The instrument cluster displays status information about different operating systems in the 
vehicle. The information is received using Dial gauges, LCD display, Warning LEDs and 
Gong tones. 


• Z8 instrument cluster is based on the E39 technology (base version). Due to the 
limited space available in the Z8, the indicator instruments have been separated from 
the electronics. The resulting indicator modules are connected with the electronic 
control (instrument cluster module) through a separate wiring harness. 

• The instrument cluster consists of 7 modules, 4 modules with pointer instruments 
(stepper motor driven) and 3 modules with displays and control. The instrument 
cluster control module (IKE) contains the necessary electronics to control the modules. 


• The IKE is connected to the vehicle wiring harness and contains the three bus 
interfaces - Diagnosis bus, K-bus, and Can-bus.

Instruments, Indicators and Displays 

Speedometer 

The speedometer module is equipped with different indicators corresponding to the coun¬ 
try-specific variant. The distance pulse for indicating the road speed comes from the DSC 
control module. The input to the DSC ill originates from the rear left wheel speed sensor. 

Tachometer 

The tachometer is controlled by the IKE (rpm signal supplied by the ECM). The engine 
speed information is made available to the other control units via the K-bus. 

Clock 

The time is indicated by a classic looking analog clock (refer to control knob for setting). 

Fuel Gauge 

The level in the fuel tank is measured with a lever-type sensor that is connected to the IKE 
using a dedicated ground terminal and sensor circuit. The level sensor does contain a 
reserve contact. The fuel reserve warning light is activated by the IKE based on the low level 
of the sensor. The "fuel reserve" signal is additionally output as information for the engine 
management. The level sensor is designed for the shape of the tank by the resistance char¬ 
acteristic curve and IKE coding data. 

Coolant Temperature Gauge 

The coolant temperature is measured in the Engine Control Module (ECM) and is sent via 
the CAN-bus to the IKE for the instrument modules. The coolant temperature information 
is also provided to other systems on the K-bus. The IKE also determines the coolant tem¬ 
perature with a separate NTC sensor. This temperature is indicated in the coolant temper¬ 
ature gauge during the initialization phase of the CAN-bus. To prevent “heat surge” from 
affecting the gauge after a hot engine restart, the IKE buffers this circuit. If the IKE detects 
a higher temperature on restart compared to when the engine was switched off, the value 
stored at "engine off” is indicated. The current value will be displayed approximately 20 sec¬ 
onds after restart. 

Coolant Overheat Warning 

The IKE activates on the coolant overheat warning light for 2 seconds when the igni¬ 
tion is switched on (pre-drive check). It is then controlled by the engine control module via 
the CAN-bus. If the coolant overheat warning light is activated by the engine control mod¬ 
ule, this CAN message is made available to other modules on the K-bus. The IKE receives 
the value via the CAN-bus and If the maximum value is reached, the gauge needle is moved 
in the center of the red warning zone.

Interior Features/E52 


Service Interval Display (SIA4) 

The Service interval Display (SIA4) is a consumption-dependent distance-based inspection 
display with the ability to indicate remaining distance. It serves the driver and the workshop 
as an indication showing when an engine oil service or distance based inspection is due. 
The current Service Interval status is indicated as from ignition "terminal 15 ON" for uptolO 
seconds after reaching a minimum engine speed of 400 rpm. The SIA4 data is also stored 
in the light check module (LCM). The SIA4 can be reset like current BMW models. Each 
reset can be carried out independent of each other, oil service or distance inspection reset. 

Total Distance and Trip Odometer 

The current trip odometer reading is shown in the display from ignition terminal R "ON". 
When terminal R is switched "OFF” the odometer reading (total mileage) can be displayed 
for approx. 25 seconds by pressing the trip odometer reset button and then releasing it. 
The total distance is made available on the K-bus which is stored in the IKE and in the LCM. 

Ambient Temperature 

The IKE determines the current outside temperature based on the outside temperature sen¬ 
sor (NTC resistor). The outside temperature sensor has a dedicated ground and sensor cir¬ 
cuit to the IKE. The "outside temperature” information is transferred from the instrument 
cluster on the bus and is displayed by the multifunction radio (MIR). When the ignition is 
switched off, the outside temperature sensor is read in timed minute intervals by the IKE. 
For this purpose, the IKE is activated for a short time, it makes available the "outside tem¬ 
perature" information and then switches off again (sleep mode). 

Instrument Light Dimming 

The instrument lights and the digital display lighting are dimmed in different ways. The pulse 
width modulated signal (58g) from the LCM is used for instrument light dimming. With the 
lights switched off, the brightness information from the phototransistor (integrated in the 
speedometer) is used for the purpose of controlling and adapting the lighting of the digital 
display to the ambient conditions. With the lights switched on, the lighting intensity can be 
additionally varied with the dimmer within a limited range. In this case, the ambient light 
information provided by the phototransitors has priority in controlling the intensity of the 
lights.

Warning and Indicator Lights 

General information: light emitting didoes (LEDs) are used to backlight all warning light 
symbols. Two-colored LEDs are used for symbols that can light up red or yellow. 

General Brake Warning Light 

Illuminated red when: 

• Parking brake applied with ignition switched on. 

• Brake fluid low level warning via bus signal from the LCM. 

• Malfunction signal on CAN-bus from DSC to the IKE. 

• Electronic brake pressure distribution (EBV) failure warning from DSC control unit. 
Illuminated yellow when: 

• Malfunction warning on CAN-bus brake assistant from DSC control unit. 

During the pre-drive check, the warning light is illuminated red and yellow for 1 second pro¬ 
vided the function for the brake assistant is coded, otherwise the warning light will be illu¬ 
minated only in red for 2 seconds. If the parking brake is applied, only the red warning light 
will be illuminated. 

The warning light can light up yellow only when there is no warning for red. The DSC 
switches on the yellow warning light via the CAN-bus if the DSC detects a mal¬ 
function in the brake assist. 

Seat Belt Indicator Light 

The seat belt indicator light is activated when ignition terminal 15 is switched "ON". The 
LCM sends a K-bus signal until the seat belt is latched (contact is opened). 

Indicator Lights 

Direction indicator, high beam, and the rear fog light indicator lights are switched by means 
of a corresponding bus message from the LCM to the IKE. 

Charge Indicator Light 

The warning light is activated by the compact alternator when there is no charging output 
to the IKE.

Oil Light 

The red warning light is activated by the oil pressure switch. 

The yellow warning light is activated by a K-bus message from the LCM to the IKE. The 
engine control module (ECM) evaluates the signal from the oil level sensor in the engine and 
sends a CAN message to the IKE. 

The IKE converts the message and passes it on to the LCM via the K-bus. The LCM com¬ 
pares the signal to coded data and sends a K-bus message to the IKE. The IKE activates 
the oil level warning with priority given to the oil pressure warning. 

The oil indicator light is illuminated yellow under following conditions: 

Oil level sensor defective: The oil level sensor is monitored by the ECM, and if a defect is 
detected, a message is sent to the LCM that is stored in fault memory. The LCM switches 
on the oil indicator light (yellow for oil level warning) for 30 seconds via the K-bus. This fault 
is set with ignition "ON", engine speed and oil pressure must have been detected. 

Low oil level detected: Low oil level is detected by the ECM only when the engine is run¬ 
ning and a message is sent to the LCM. This information is stored in the LCM and activates 
the yellow oil level indicator light for approximately 30 seconds after the ignition has been 
switched off. 

Oil loss recognized: Oil loss is detected by the ECM only when the engine is running. 
Consequently, the LCM immediately switches on the yellow oil level indicator light. 

ABS Indicator Light 

The warning light is activated by the ABS/DSC system. The warning light must also be 
activated if a signal line is interrupted. 

The circuit logic is: 

• Low signal (ground) = warning light off. 

• High signal (system voltage) = warning light on. 

• High signal (high resistance, break) = warning lamp on, recognizes a break or interruption 
in the signal line. 

SRS Indicator Light 

The SRS warning light is activated by a ground signal from the SRS control module for 
pre-drive check as well as system faults.

Interior Features/E52 


I 



Service Engine Soon Light 

The "Service Engine Soon" warning light is activated by the ECM via the CAN bus. The light 
is illuminated for pre-drive checks as well as emission related faults. 

Warning Light for Automatic Stability Control (DSC) 

The "ASC" warning light is switched by the DSC system via the CAN-bus. As a function 
check after switching on the ignition, the DSC switches on the warning light for a limited 
period of time (pre-drive check). 

Warning Light for Tire Pressure Warning (DWS) 

The tire failure warning light is switched by a corresponding bus message from the tire pres¬ 
sure warning system (DWS) to the IKE. As a function check, the warning light is activated 
for 2 seconds (pre-drive check). 

The "EML" warning light is activated by the ECM via the CAN bus. If EML message is not 
received on the CAN-bus from the ECM to the IKE, the warning light is switched on for 1.5 
seconds after switching on the ignition (emergency running value). 

Brake Lining Warning Light (BBV) 

The brake lining warning light is located in the left direction indicator and is activated by 
the IKE. As a function check, the warning light is switched on for approx. 2 seconds after 
the ignition is switched on (pre-drive check). The sensors consist of a circuit loop in the rear 
right and front left brake pads (connected in series). When the brake pad is worn, the cir¬ 
cuit loop is interrupted (recognized by the IKE) and the warning light is activated. The warn¬ 
ing is cancelled if the interruption is not detected for 30 seconds after ignition "ON" with the 
engine not running. 

Convertible Top Warning L ght 

The convertible top warning light is activated by the Convertible Top Module (CVM III) via a 
circuit line. The warning light illuminates when the convertible top is operated, and flashes 
if the convertible top is not locked in either end position. 

Lights On Warning 

'he audible warning for the lights “ON” and the indicator clock is installed in the gseedome- 
ter module. The "lights ON" warning sounds for 8 cycles (one cycle = 500 ms "ON" / 500 
ms "OFF) when the ignition is switched off, the driver's door is opened for the first time and 
the instrument lights are switched on. The message to trigger the "lights ON" warning is 
read via the K-bus and is controlled by the IKE. 



Interior Featurea/E52 


Ignition Key Warning 


The "ignition key warning" function is activated by the IKE. Based on a K-bus message, the 
LCM triggers the audible warning. The ignition key warning is triggered when the ignition is 
switched off and the driver's door is opened. The warning is immediately cancelled if the 
IKE receives a message from the LCM. 

Acoustic Cycle for Direction Indicators 


The acoustic generator for the direction indicators and the lights “ON" warning is installed 
in the speedometer module. The IKE activates the acoustic relay synchronously with the 
left and right direction indicator lights as well as the direction indicators. The "direction indi¬ 
cator" information comes from the LCM via the K-bus that also controls the synchroniza¬ 
tion. If a bulb failure is detected in a direction indicator, the IKE is informed by a K-bus mes¬ 
sage. Both indicator lamps are activated at twice the normal cycle frequency. 


Gong 


The IKE controls the tone 3 (T3) in the gong. An acoustic warning is output for the seat belt 
warning, ignition key warning, hand brake warning, tire pressure warning and speed 
warning. Depending on the type of warning, a short tone 3 (T3) is output repeatedly or only 
once. 


Acoustic seat belt warning: an acoustic seat belt warning is possible only in 
conjunction with a driver's seat belt buckle contact. The warning is activated by the LCM 
via the K-bus. When the belt contact is opened, the IKE activates the gong tone 3 (T3) 
intermittently for a maximum of 6 seconds after switching on the ignition. The gong is 
deactivated if the seat belt is buckled before this period of time has elapsed. 

Acoustic ignition lock warning: the ignition key warning is triggered for a maximum of 60 
seconds if the driver's door is opened with the ignition switched off. 

Acoustic speed warning: a speed warning is triggered by the IKE. If the speed threshold is 
exceeded, a short tone 3 (T3) sounds in the gong. If the speed drops below this threshold 
by more than 5 km/h, the tone will be triggered again upon exceeding the threshold. 

Acoustic parking brake warning: a parking brake warning is triggered at the gong as soon 
as the handbrake is applied and a road speed of more than 3 km/h is 
detected. The intermittent tone sounds for as long as the warning condition is applied or 
maximum 20 seconds. 

Acoustic tire pressure warning: the tire failure warning light is activated via the K-bus from 
the tire pressure warning system to the IKE. An acoustic warning in the form of the single 
tone 3 gong is triggered provided the ignition is switched on.

Workshop Hints 

Replacing the IKE 

The four examples described in the following section outline the procedure, conditions, and 

measures to ensure trouble-free repair of the instrument cluster. 

Example 1: the IKE is defective and the LCM is OK. 

• Replace the IKE (new part). 

• The manipulation dot is set with the ignition switched on. 

• The manipulation dot is set as the vehicle identification number in the LCM differs 
from the vehicle identification number in the IKE. 

• Re-encode the IKE. 

• Encode the IKE in accordance with the central encoding code. 

• Encode the vehicle identification number in the IKE. If the vehicle identification 
number is not encoded in the IKE, the total distance will not be recorded either in 
the IKE or in the LCM. 

• Switch the ignition off and on again. The manipulation point goes out, the 
IKE adopts the total mileage and the SIA4 data from the LCM. The infor 
mation exchange between the IKE and the LCM for joint data storage (SIA 
data, total mileage, vehicle identification number) is taken over. 

Example 2: the IKE is OK and the LCM is defective. 

• Replace the LCM (new part). 

• The manipulation dot is set with the ignition switched on. 

• The manipulation dot is set if the vehicle identification number in the LCM differs from 
the vehicle identification number in the IKE. 

• Re-encode the LCM in accordance with the central encoding code. 

• Encode the vehicle identification number in the LCM, the total distance will not 
be recorded in the LCM as long as the vehicle identification number is not 
encoded in the LCM. 

• Switch ignition off and on again. The manipulation dot goes out, the LCM adopts the 
total mileage and the SIA4 data from the IKE. The information exchange between 
the IKE and the LCM for joint data storage (SIA data, total 

mileage, vehicle identification number) is taken over.

Interior Featureo/E52 




JKH 


• T nr imw 




wNitoi 


Example 3: the IKE and the LCM need to be replaced. 

Note: Replace both control modules at the same time only when necessary (total mileage 

recording will be irretrievably lost). 

• Replace the IKE and LCM with the battery disconnected (new parts). 

• When the ignition is switched on, the manipulation dot is set and the total mileage 
is set to zero. The previous total mileage is irretrievably lost. 

• Encode the IKE and LCM in accordance with the central encoding code. 

• Encode the vehicle identification number in the IKE and in the LCM. 

• Switch ignition off and on again. The manipulation dot goes out, the LCM adopts the 
total mileage and the SIA4 data from the IKE. The information exchange 
between the IKE and the LCM for joint data storage (SIA4 data, total mileage, 
vehicle identification number) is taken over. 

Example 4: the IKE or the LCM is to be replaced as a "diagnostic test”. 

Note: Although, in principle, replacing one of the two control units as a test is possible, it 

should be avoided. 

• The IKE or the LCM from another vehicle is installed for testing purposes. 

• When the ignition is switched on, the manipulation dot is set and the IKE 
continues to record the total mileage. The total mileage is only recorded in the 
IKE as long as the vehicle identification number differs. There is no total 
mileage transfer to the LCM.

Control Panel - Connections 


A total of 3 plug connections 
are integrated in the IHKS 
control module. 

The forth is a separate con¬ 
nection to the blower switch. 



The IHKS control module 
is located on the back of 
the control panel. 

The Z8 IHKS can be coded and 
diagnosed via the DIS/MoDIC. 



Blower Setting 

The blower control is designed as a 5-stage switch (including off). When the blower switch 
is set to the zero position all flaps are closed and the refrigerant circuit is switched off 
automatically. 

' he IHKS features "ram air compensation in which the fresh air flap is increasingly closed 
as the vehicle speed increases thus making it dependent on the type of top used (hardtop 
or soft top). The fresh air flap is operated by a high speed stepper motor. The IHKS receives 
information (via the K-bus) as to whether the soft top is open or closed.

Air Distribution 

The air flow is adjusted by a 360° potentiometer. The 
flaps are controlled by 3 stepper motors (bus) that oper¬ 
ate the defroster, face vent and foot well flaps. Flap 
control is dependent on the position of the air distribu¬ 
tion knob as well as the position of the temperature 
knob. 

Different characteristic curves are used for the maxi¬ 
mum warm setting and the maximum cold setting. If the 
temperature control knob is anywhere between these 
two settings, the new flap position is set.

Flap setting 


The stepper motors for flap operation execute a position run after ignition terminal 15 has 
been switched off. The fresh air and defroster flaps are completely opened, and all other 
flaps are closed. 

The temperature setting flap is the only flap that remains unchanged. This procedure 
lasts approximately 15 seconds. 

The IHKS performs a calibration run after every 20th time the ignition is switched off or 
after an interruption in memory power. The flap end positions serve as reference points. 

A total of five (200 Hz) stepper motors with M-bus activation and one (500 Hz) high 
speed fresh air motor are used.

Auxiliary Water Pump 

An auxiliary water pump is installed to ensure the necessary water flow rate at low engine 
rpm. 

The auxiliary water pump is switched on when the following conditions are fulfilled: 

• Water valve is opened (de-energized) 

• Engine rpm < 2000 rpm 

• Engine temperature > 32 °F 

• Start procedure completed (terminal 50) 

The auxiliary water pump is switched off when, apart from the engine speed that must 
exceed 2500 rpm, at least one of the above conditions is not fulfilled. 


23 

Internor Features/E52 



Temperature Control 

The rotary knob locks in both end positions. The temperature is set by means of a mixing 
flap that is operated by a stepper motor (bus). The temperature control potentiometer 
can be turned through an angle of 240°. 

The water valve is closed when the control knob is set in the minimum position. From the 
10 o'clock position (potentiometer value) on, the water valve is opened and the auxiliary 
water pump switched on. 

Air Conditioning 

The air conditioning is requested by a combination switch. The IHKS activates the A/C 
compressor magnetic clutch, and cool air flows from the evaporator. With the aid of 
a temperature mixing flap, this air is blended with warm air from the heater core. 

To prevent the evaporator surface from icing up, the evaporator temperature sensor sig¬ 
nals the IHKS to deactivate the compressor clutch. The switching threshold is 
set at approximately 1 °C (34 degrees F). 

Idle Speed Compensation 

The Engine Control Module (ECM) compensates the idle speed to ensure smooth opera¬ 
tion of the engine at idle. 

The IHKS will signal the ECM for idle speed compensation when at least one of the 
following conditions occurs: 

• Rear window defogger switched on (hardtop fitted) 

• Blower set to max. position 

• Air conditioning switched on 


Filling Station Effect 

The filling station effect corresponds to the heater core “hot soak”, because the water 
valve is sprung open with out power. In order to avoid this effect, after ignition 
terminal 15 is switched off, power is still applied to the water valve for 5 minutes. 


24

Characteristic Map Cooling 

Characteristic map cooling is not used in the Z8 with the S62 B50 engine. 

Defroster Function 

he defroster function has priority over other functions. It has the task of defrosting the 
windshield as fast as possible. 

The following functions are activated for this purpose: 

• The temperature is set to maximum warm. 

• The blower speed is set to the highest stage. 

• Defroster flaps fully open. 

• All other air distribution flaps are closed. 

• The fresh air flap is fully opened (recirculated air closed). 

• The water valve is opened. 

• The auxiliary water pump is switched on. 


Rear Window Defogger 

This function is active only in conjunction with the hardtop. During the defrost phase the 
heating is fully powered for 17 minutes. 

If the defrost phase is not sufficient to completely defrost the rear window the 
heating can be activated for a further 5 minutes by pressing the rear window 
defogger button again. 

If the heating is switched off for any reason the timer is stopped so that defrosting can 
continue from exactly this point when switched on again. 

The rear window defogger is completely deactivated when the unloader function is active 
(starting the vehicle).

Auxiliary Fan 

The auxiliary fan stage (speed) is determined from the refrigerant pressure sensor signal. 
The IHKS signals the ECM via the K-bus, and the ECM will activate the auxiliary fan. The 
fan stage (speed) is generally set to 0 at vehicle speeds above 50 mph (ram air). 



K-bus Interface 

This interface transmits data such as the vehicle speed, engine speed and diagnosis 
between the IHKS control unit and the IKE. 

The K-bus is also used to transmit compressor load values as well as auxiliary fan request 
from the IHKS through the IKE then over the can line to the ECM.

Diagnosis 

All inputs and outputs are monitored by the iHKS control module. Faults are stored in the 
EEPROM after terminal 15 has been switched off. Faults that occur sporadically can be 
deleted by the IHKS control module after successful self-repair. However, the entry "spo¬ 
radic fault" is retained. 

Unlike previous IHKS systems, the 28 version is diagnoseable via DIS/MoDIC.

Vehicle Electrical System 


Purpose of the System 

The state of the art Z8 electrical system satisfies all of today's demanding requirements. 
The Z8 electrical system is developed from the E46 concept. 



The Z8 electrical system concept with its stringent power and weight requirements that 
BMW places on all sports cars was considered in wiring harness production. 

The wiring harness is divided into three sections: 

(Telephone provisions can be provided optionally) 

1. Main wiring harness (repair kits for left front, right front and right rear) 

2. Audio/navigation (left rear, no repair kit)

Purpose of the System 

The ZKE V system is a new variant Central Body Electronics system unique to the Z8. 
Many of it’s features and functions operate similarly to previous BMW ZKE systems with 
minor changes, added features, and refinements. 

The following functions are directly controlled by the General Module V (GM V): 

• Windshield wiping/washing and headlight washing 

• Central locking with power trunk/fuel filler door release 

• FZV Keyless Entry 

• Power window control 

• Anti-theft warning (DWA) 

The following functions are included as body electrical systems but are not 
directly controlled by the GM V: 

• Driver and Passenger seat electrical adjustment (no control module - switch con¬ 
trolled) 

• Side Mirror - adjustment/heating (also includes windshield washer jet heating) 

• Electrochromic rearview mirror 

• MRS III 

ZKE V introduces the following changes and new features: 

• Similar to the E46 GM V, the Z8 GM V controls it’s respective peripheral 
components directly (no P-Bus). It communicates with other pertinent 
control modules via the K-bus as does the E38/E39 GM V. 

• The GM V is responsible for the Car/Key Memory feature. Key memory provides 
the added convenience of identifying users of the vehicle. Whenever the vehicle 

is locked or unlocked via the FZV keyless entry system, a unique key identification 
signal (key number) is transmitted to the General Module. 


7 

Central Body Elect ronics/E 52 







































The Central Locking system of ZKE V controls the door lock, trunk lock, fuel filler flap, 
glove box, telephone storage compartment, and DWA. 

The familiar single/double locking strategy is maintained from previous systems with 
the introduction of a new style door lock mechanism combined with dual actuator 
motors (similar to E46). 

The new style actuators are sealed, self contained units with no replaceable parts. 

The door lock actuator use hall effect sensors in place of pin contacts and microswitches 
to provide: 

• Door lock key position (driver’s door only), 

• Door open/closed status (replaces door jamb switch). 


The Driver’s door lock location is the only 
point outside of the vehicle where the key 
can mechanically control all of the central 
locking system functions. 

Shown to the right is the lock cylinder is 
protected by a spring loaded cover. 


The central locking switch is located in 
the center console. 

Locking the vehicle from the central switch 
(indicated by the arrow on the right) "single 
locks” the vehicle except for the fuel filler flap, 
glove box, and telephone storage com¬ 
partment. 



The passenger door is fitted with a manual locking knob which can lock the door if the 
vehicle battery were to fail. Simply slide the knob downward and close the door. It can 
not be opened from the outside. In this position, the door can be opened from the inside 
by pulling the inside door handle (2x).

• The Z8 can be locked with the top down. When the vehicle is locked with the 
exterior mechanical key or FZV, the doors, glove box and telephone storage 
compartment are locked. Locking the glovebox with a "master Key" will also lock 
out the trunk and telephone storage compartment. The Navigation and cd changer 
storage compartments can be mechanically locked with a “master key”. 



• The trunk can be unlocked remotely with the key (FZV) but does not lock/unlock the 
entire vehicle. The trunk can be opened by depressing the trunk button in the left kick 
panel. The mechanical release is located in the Navigation storage compartment. 

• GM V and EWS 3.3 interface via the K bus to monitor double lock status and to initiate 
double lock override. This feature allows the doors to be opened from the inside if an 
accepted EWS key is switched on in the ignition when double locked. 

• The selective unlocking feature of the E38/E39 is maintained on the ZKE V. 
A single unlock request from the driver’s door with the key or via the remote 
transmitter unlocks the driver’s door only. A second unlock request unlocks the 
passenger door. 

• Car/Key memory coding allows the “single’’ locking to be activated after the vehicle is 
driven off. 

• The Multiple Restraint System (MRS III) control module provides a switched 
signal to the GM in the event of an accident. The signal is an output function of the 
MRS control module and becomes active when MRS determines a crash has 
occurred. When active, the GM unlocks the door lock actuator, switches on the 
interior lights and signals the LCM via the K bus to activate the hazard warning 
flasher. Once the crash signal is active, the GM will not respond to lock requests 
from the system until the ignition switch is cycled or a front door is opened. 

• Continuous locking/unlocking will initiate a timed arrest of the locking system. The GM 
counts each time the locks are actuated. After approximately 12 cycles, the timed 
arrest is active. The timed arrest is deactivated one actuator cycle for every 8 seconds until 
the counter is reset to 0. The timed arrest is overridden if a crash signal is received from 
the MRS III. 


10 

Central Locking/E52 






The driver’s door lock provides the following familiar signals to the General Module: 

• Lock / Unlock 

• DWA arm/disarm 

• Convenience closing and opening signals 

• Provides a mechanical link to manually lock/unlock 
the actuator in the event of a failure. 

• The GM monitors these key positions over two wires. 

The signals are generated by two hall effect sensors 
(Hall Sensor 1 & 2) located in the actuator. 


Hall sensor 1 & 2 is not included in the 
passenger door actuator. 

When the key is turned, a plastic cylinder in the lock actuator is simultaneously 
rotated by the lock tumbler extension rod. An asymmetrical shaped magnet is 
incorporated in the plastic cylinder, which when rotated changes the magnetic 
influence on the hall sensors. The presence of a magnet in close proximity to the 
sensing surface of either hall sensor creates a coded input over the two wires that the 
GM uses to determine the key position. 

• Magnet in front of sensor, current flow through the sensor is <5 mA ( 0 ). 

• Magnet rotated away from sensor, current flow through the sensor is >12 mA (1). 

Hall effect sensors improve the actuator reliability since they are impervious to moisture and 
there are no wear contacts. 

• Key in the neutral position, both sensors are simultaneously influenced by the 
magnet - 0 / 0 . 

• Key turned to the unlock position from neutral, hall sensor #1 magnet segment moves 
away from hall sensor -1/0. 

• Key turned to lock position from neutral, hall sensor #2 magnet segment moves away 
form hall sensor - 0 / 1 . 





Centra! Locking/E52 











I 




There are two motors incorporated in each actuator that provide two separate 
functions: 

• Single lock/unlock function. Also known as central lock, this motor controls the 
mechanical lock mechanism when the central lock button is pressed to single 
lock the vehicle. The lock mechanism is fully locked at this point but can still by 
opened from the interior by pulling an interior door handle twice or by pressing 
the central lock button again. When single lock function is activated, the 
fuel filler flap actuator, glove box, and telephone storage compartment is not 
locked. 

• Double lock/unlock function. Also known as central arrest, this motor is 
activated only when the vehicle is locked from the outside at the driver’s door lock 
with a key or when the GM receives a lock request from the FZV system. In this case 
the double lock motor is activated simultaneously with the single lock motor. The 
function of the double lock motor is to mechanically offset an internal rod 
disabling it from unlocking the vehicle from the interior. This prevents the doors 
from being unlocked by any means except from an unlock request at the driver’s 
door or via the FZVremote key. 


Note: This component has been disassembled to provide functional understand¬ 
ing. This component does not contain any replaceable parts and will void it’s war 
ranty if disassembled. 


Central Locking/E52 









Door Contact Hall Sensor 

Also included in the drivers door actuator is a third hall effect sensor. This sensor signals 
the door open/closed status to the GM. This sensor replaces the doorjamb mechanical 
switch of previous systems. The rotary latch plate position activates the door contact hall 
sensor. 

• When the door latch is closed, current flow through the sensor is <5 mA ( 0 ). 

• When the door is open, current flow through the sensor is >12 mA (1). 

The passenger side door actuator only includes this hall effect sensor (hall sensor 3). Hall 
sensors 1 & 2 are not required. 


Fuel Filler Flap Remote Unlock 

The fuel filler flap can be opened from inside the vehicle by pressing the remote 
button (combined with the trunk button) when the vehicle is unlocked or single locked 
from the central lock button. 


The remote fuel filler flap button is locked out when the GM detects a vehicle speed signal 
> 4 MPH via the K-bus. 



Trunk Remote Unlock 

The trunk can be opened from inside the 
vehicle by pressing the remote trunk button 
when the vehicle is unlocked or single locked 
from the central lock button. The trunk can also 
be opened from the remote key (FZV). 

The remote trunk button is locked out 
when the glove box is locked in the 
hotel setting and/or when the GM detects 
a vehicle speed signal > 4 MPH via the 
K-bus.

Windshield Wiping/Washing System 

Model: E52 

Production Date: 03/00 to Present 


Purpose of the System 

The Z8 windshield wiping/washing system is very traditional in operation, however an 
aggressive sport "look" has been given to the wiper arm mounting and 
articulation. The wiper arm mounting posts are positioned outboard on 
the windshield cowling. 


The windshield wiping/washing 
system is similar to the E38/E39 
system. 


All wiping/washing functions 
are controlled by the GM V. 


Output control of the wiper motor 
is through a windshield wiper dou¬ 
ble contact relay, which is located 
under the carpet below the glove- 
box. 

The system has four wiping 
stages with interval wiping The 
wiping stage inputs are coded 
signals through a two wire link with 
a combination of high/low inputs 
as on previous systems. 



14 

Wipe Wash/E52 




ME2 



Wmsi 






■pH 




The wiping stages include 

Single: Holding the wiper switch down in the single position provides a ground 
signal to activate the slow speed circuit providing wiper operation until the switch is 
released. 

Intermittent: The intermittent wiping is activated by placing the switch in the first “up” 
position. Switching off the ignition in this position raises the wipers to the "service 
position”. 

• The intermittent wiping intervals are dependent on the road speed. 

• As road speed increases, the wiping interval delay is decreased. 

Slow (I) and Fast (II): The stage I and stage II wiping speeds are also affected by road 
speed. The factory encoded settings are the same as previous systems: 

• Stage I automatically switches to intermittent when the vehicle is stopped, and 
resumes stage I when vehicle speed is present. 

• Stage II automatically switches to stage I when the vehicle is stopped, and 
resumes stage II when vehicle speed is present.

Windshield/Headlight Washing 


Windshield Washing: Pulling the Windshield Wiper Switch rearward doses the “wind¬ 
shield wash” contacts and provides a switched ground input to the GM. The GM acti¬ 
vates the windshield washer pump directly via a power output final stage transistor. The 
wiper motor is also activated to wipe the glass clean. 

Windshield/Headlight Washing: Pushing the windshield wiper switch forward requests 
windshield/headlight washing, regardless of the headlights being switched on or off. The 
signal activates the headlight washer relay which powers the headlight washer pump 
(nozzles are pressure opened) for 2 cycles. A time “arrest” (3 min.) will prevent unneces¬ 
sary washing (which can be overridden by cycling the ignition). This system uses a com¬ 
mon reservoir, located in the rear of the right front fender (5.3 L).

Antitheft Warning System 


Purpose of the System 

The 28 is equipped with the familiar DWA that has traditionally protected BMWs with 
Antitheft Warning. In addition, DWA offers a superior protection package because 
the system uses pre-existing ZKE components. 

The General Module utilizes existing components and/or circuits as part of the DWA 
system: 

• Door Lock Hall Effect Sensor Contacts (door open/closed). 

• Trunk Actuator Switch Contact (monitored for closed trunk).

Door Contacts 

As mentioned in the Central Locking Section, the door lock contact hall effect 
sensors provide status of door open/closed. 

• When the door latch is closed, current flow through the sensor is <5 mA (0). 

• When the door is open, current flow through the sensor is >12 mA (1). 

The GM will activate the siren if a door open signal becomes active when the DWA is 
armed. 




Trunk Actuator Switch Contacts 

The trunk switch contact is located in the trunk lock 
actuator assembly. When closed, the trunk contact 
provides a ground signal to the GM signifying a 
"closed trunk". The GM will activate the siren if 
the trunk switch contact ground signal opens 
when the DWA is armed (except when using 
FZV). 




Hood Contact Switch 

Located on the left side engine compartment, the hood contact switch provides a ground 
signal to the GM signifying an open hood. 

The plunger of this switch can be pulled up past a detente causing the switch 
contact to open (service position). This feature can be used to simulate a closed hood 
with the hood open when diagnosing the DWA system. 

DWA LED 

As on other BMWs, the DWA indicator is located in 
the rear view mirror. The LED is provided with 
constant battery voltage (KL 30). The GM provides 
a switched ground signal providing the various 
blinking signals used to convey DWA status to the 
vehicle operator (covered further on). 




20 

DWA/E52 

















Tift Sensor 


Located in the Navigation storage compartment, the tilt sensor is an electronic 
sensing device with the sole purpose of monitoring the vehicle's parked angle when 
DWA is armed. This sensor is a new, one third smaller, solid state version (E46 similar). 



The sensor requires three signal wires to perform its function: 

• KL 30 - Constant battery voltage 

• Signal "STDWA"; switched ground input signal provided by the GM indicating DWA 
armed/disarmed status. The tilt sensor is used as a splice location for the STDWA 
signal to the Siren and FIS interior protection sensor. 

• Signal "NG"; switched ground output signal provided to the GM. 

The signal is used for two purposes: 

1. As a momentary acknowledgment that the tilt sensor received STDWA and is 
currently monitoring the vehicle angle. 

2 . If the tilt sensor detects a change in the vehicle's angle when DWA is armed, 
signal NG is switched to inform the GM to activate the siren. 

When the tilt sensor receives the STDWA signal from the GM it memorizes the 
vehicle's parked angle. The angle of the vehicle is monitored by the solid state 
electronics. Once armed, if the angle changes, the tilt sensor provides a switched ground 
signal to the GM to activate DWA.

Alarm Siren 

• The DWA siren is installed in the vehicle cowl under the micro-filters, his location pro 
vides a secure position with loud acoustic output. 

• The siren contains electronic circuitry for producing the warning tone when the alarm 
is triggered. The siren also contains a rechargeable battery that is used to power the 
siren when the alarm is triggered. 

• The rechargeable battery will allow the siren to sound if it or the vehicle's battery is 
disconnected. The siren battery is recharged, from the vehicle’s battery when DWA is 
not in the armed state. 

• The siren has four wires connecting it to the system; KL 30, KL 31, Signal 
STDWA (arm/disarm signal from GM), and Signal A/G(activate siren output signal to 
the GM) 

• The arm/disarm output signal from the GM (STDWA) is provided to the Tilt sensor, 
SDR module and the siren simultaneously. The arm/disarm signal is a switched 
ground that signals the components of DWA armed/disarmed status. 

• The activate siren signal (NG is high whether DWA is armed or disarmed). If a 
monitored input activates the alarm, the high signal to the siren is switched to a 50% 
duty cycle at the GM. The control circuitry in the siren activates the siren driver. 

If the DWA is armed and the battery is disconnected the siren 
recognizes the normally high “NG" signal as suddenly going low, the siren is also 
activated. 


DWA Arming/Disarmtng 

• The DWA is armed every time the vehicle is locked from the outside with the door 
lock cylinder or FZV key. 

• The LED in the rear view mirror flashes as an acknowledgment along with the exterior 
lights and a momentary chirp from the siren. 

• The GM monitors all required input signals for closed status (door dosed, trunk 
closed, etc.) The inputs must be in a closed status for a minimum of 3 seconds for 
the GM to include them as an activation component. Change of status remonitors the 
inputs. 

Example: Hood being left open, then closed after the alarm has been set on. 

• If the DWA is armed a second time within 10 seconds, the tilt sensor and 
interior protection (SDR) are also excluded as alarm activation components. This 
function is useful if the vehicle is transported on a train or flat bed truck to 
prevent false alarm activations. 









22 

DWA/E52 





While armed the trunk can be opened with out the alarm being triggered as follows: 

• If opened with the trunk remote button via the FZV, the GM prevents the alarm from 
activating. When the trunk is returned to the closed position, it is no longer considered 
as an activation signal. 

Panic Mode Operation: When the trunk button is pressed and held, the GM is 
signaled to activate the siren for the Panic Mode. The panic mode is function with either 
an armed or disarmed DWA system. 


Emergency Disarming 

Emergency disarming occurs automatically if a key is used to turn the ignition switch on 
and the EWS III accepts it. The EWS III signals the GM to unlock the doors and deactivate 
the DWA. 


Alarm Indication 

When the alarm is triggered, the siren will sound for 30 seconds. At the same time the 
parking and high beam lights will flash for 5 minutes. The GM signals the the LCM via the 
K bus to flash the lights. 

Following an alarm trigger, the system will reset and trigger again if further 
tampering is done to the vehicle.

Interior/Map Light Unit 

The overhead interior/map lights are contained in the rear view mirror, consisting of 2 lights. 
The lights are controlled by the GM automatically or by momentarily "twisting’' the inte¬ 
rior light switch (DWA indicator) located on the rear view mirror. 



The switch provides a momentary ground signal that the GM recognizes as a request to 
either turn the lights on (if off) or turn the lights off (if on). 

If the switch (DWA indicator) is held for more than 3 seconds, the GM interprets the 
continuous ground signal as a request to turn the interior light circuit off (workshop mode) 
as on previous systems. 

The workshop mode is stored in memory and will not come back on even if the GM 
is removed from it's power supply and reconnected. The switch must be activated 
to turn the lights back on. 

The lights can be used individually as reading/map lights. Each light is mechanically 
controlled by depressing it's corresponding on/off switch. 

The power supply for the map lights is supplied by the GM through the Consumer Cut Off 
circuit.

■ 


Front Footwell Lights 

In each front footwell, there is also a courtesy light. These lights are only operated when 
the GM provides power to the interior lighting circuit. 


Rear Compartment Lights 

Lights are installed behind the seats to allow 
visibility for the Navigation/cd changer compart¬ 
ments. 


Door Lighting 

The doors are equipped with exit access lighting, 
as well as "red” safety lights when the doors are 
opened. 

The inside door handles are back lit with an led. 


Night Lights 

The night lights are are located above the rear view mirror on the windshield frame. They 
provide a subtle illumination of the center console when the headlights are switched 
on. 

Load Cutout Lights 

The remaining lights can be switched on regardless of the ignition position: 

• Reading lights 

• Glovebox light 

• Engine compartment lights 

• Luggage compartment lights 

The B+ power supply is provided by the GM V. To ensure against battery draw if the 
lights are left on, the GM V will deactivate the circuit 16 minutes after the ignition ter¬ 
minal “R” is switched off. The lights will be switched on again when ignition terminal “R” 
or "15” is switched on in addition to an input to the GM V - opening a door, hood, 
unlocking the door. 



28 

Interior Light$/E52 
















Automatic Control Function 


The GM provides 12 volts (linear application providing soft on feature) to the interior 
lighting circuit when the one of the following input signal statuses change: 

• Interior light switch 

• Door contact hall sensor active (door opened) 

• An Unlock request from the driver's door key lock hall sensors are received. 

This only occurs if the ignition switch is off. 

• An Unlock request is from the FZV keyless entry system is received via the K bus. 

This only occurs if the ignition switch is off as well. 

• The ignition switch is switched off (within 32 seconds) and the vehicle exterior lights 
(LCM) have been on for a minimum of 2 minutes prior. This information is provided 
to the GM via the K bus. 

• Active crash signal from the MRS III control module. 

• Lock button of FZV key is pressed with the vehicle is already locked (interior search 
function). 


The GM gradually reduces the full 12 volt power supply (linear reduction providing soft off) 

until the lights are off when the following input signal statuses change: 

• Interior light switch 

• Immediately after the ignition switch is turned to KL R with the driver's door hall 
sensor door contact closed. 

• When the vehicle is locked (single or double) with the door contacts closed. 

• When the vehicle door contacts are closed. The lights remain on for 20 seconds 
and then go to soft off. 

• After the interior search function is activated, the lights will automatically turn off 
(soft off) after 8 seconds. 

• After 16 minutes with a door contact active (open door) and the key off, the lights are 
switched off (consumer cutoff function).

Outside Mirror Adjustments 


Purpose of the System 

The outside mirrors can be electrically adjusted to a desired position. The Mirror 
adjust/window combination switch allows the driver to adjust the mirrors 
(up/down - left/right). This switch contains a slide switch that will "toggle" control from the 
left to right mirror. 

The mirrors contain 2 motors and traditional heating elements . The Z8 does not 
have mirror memory, and the reverse gear input has no affect on the right mirror.

CENTRAL BODY ELECTRONICS 
Remote RF (Keyless) Entry 

Model: E52 

Production Date: 03/00 


Purpose of the System 

The Z8 keyless entry system’s operation is carried over from the E38/E39. A minor 
change occured with the location of the FZV receiver module location. 

• The receiver is located in the interior rear view mirror. 

• The receiver produces a digital signal based on the transmitter command and sends it 
to the GM for processing. 

• The GM then carries out all remote lock features, window convenience 

opening feature and DWA arming/disarming functions. 

• The frequency at which the key transmits the radio signal to the receiver is 
315 MHz. 

• The system is also used to convey the key being used to lock/unlock the vehicle. 



31 

Remote Entry/E52 



System Components 

FZV Key 

• New appearance with blue and white BMW roundel. 

• New button arrangement (larger buttons) with sequential operation (enhanced 
operating convenience) 

• Rechargeable battery replaces replaceable batteries. Charged by EWS ring antenna. 

• The key housing is encapsulated and can not be opened. 

• The LED has been omitted. 

• Key is used in Z8, E46, E38 and E39 vehicles. 

Features of the kevless entry system include: 

• Up to 4 radio-control keys can be 
operated in conjunction with one vehicle. 

• Locking/unlocking of doors, trunk, fuel 
filler lid. 

• Selective unlocking of driver’s door 
(as with key in lock). 

• Arming/dis-arming of DWA alarm system. 

• Remote unlocking of the trunk only. 

• Comfort opening of windows 

• Interior lighting activation (search mode). 

• Panic mode alarm activation. 

• Automatic correction for up to 1000 
erroneous activation signals. 

• Low transmitter battery fault code 
storage in the GM. 

• An EEPROM is used to store the key 
data. The data is no longer lost when the bat 
tery is replaced and initialization is not 
required. 

• Keys delivered with a four color label 
sheet containing four different colored 
labels for each of the four possible FZV keys. 



32 

Remote Entry/E52 









FZV Key Rechargable Battery 

From KL R, the battery inside the key head is charged inductively by the EWS ring 
antenna via a coil antenna integrated in the key. The charging process is 
controlled by electronic circuitry integrated in the key. 

• The service life of a radio-control key used under normal conditions corresponds to the 
vehicle lifespan. 

• If the FZV keys are not used (ie: stored in a drawer), the battery will be 
dicharged after approx. 1.5 years. 

• The time required to fully charge a discharged battery is approx. 30 hours. 

• The remote control can be operated about 15 times after a charging period of 
approx. 30 minutes (driving time). 

The key data is stored in a transponder chip. The transponder chip is a wireless read and 
write EEPROM. It is powered via the ring coil at the steering lock. Power is applied 
electromagnetically when the key is in the ignition switch from KL R. 

The power supply is used both for data transfer as well as for charging the battery. This has 
been made possible by new development of the transponder chip. 

As with previous systems, every press of an FZV key also provides the battery charge 
condition. When the FZV electronics receives a low power condition message 
three successive times, the GM sets a fault indicating a low battery within a specific 
key. The LCM is also informed via the bus system and alerts the driver via an instrument 
cluster matrix message. 

If the battery is recharged (used operate car), the fault will be automatically deleted when 
five successive messages are received indicating a charged battery condition. The 
new battery has no affect on the EWS III communication function! 


33 

Remote Ertfry/E52 



Remote Key Initialization 

The initialization of the FZV keys is required to establish the Lock/Unlock signal 
synchronization with the GM. The initialization procedure provides the GM with a key 
identification number and a "rolling code” for each key. If the initialization is not 
performed, the GM will not respond to the key signals. 

Up to 4 remote keys can be initialized. They must be initialized at the same time. 
Key initialization is only possible with the vehicle unlocked. 


Procedure: 



1. Close all doors and have all keys available. 

2. Using key number 1, turn the ignition switch to KLR, 
then switch off within 5 seconds and remove the first key. 

3. Within 30 seconds of turning the ignition switch to “off” 
press and hold the arrow button. 

4. While holding the arrow button, press and release 
“tap”) the roundel button three times within 10 seconds. 

5. Release both buttons. The GM will immediately lock 
and unlock the doors signaling a successful initialization. 

6. If additional keys need to be initialized repeat steps 3-5 
within 30 seconds. 

7. Switching the ignition to KL R completes the 
initialization. 


SERVICE NOTE: 

The key memory function of the GM responds to the key identification number of each 
key. If the keys are not initialized in the same order prior to initialization, the key memory 
functions activated by the keys will not be assigned correctly. Always initialize the keys in 
the same order.

Power Windows 



Purpose of the System 

The Z8 power window is very unique. Features of the system operation includes: 

• Control of the window motors is carried out directly by the GM. 

• One-touch window operation in both directions (passenger side down only). 

• Window lowering/raising when the doors are opened and closed. 

• Cable type window regulators. 

• Driver’s side combination window/power mirror switch 

• Convenience closing/opening of the windows from the driver's lock cylinder or 
convenience opening only from the FZV remote key 

• Window operation with the ignition switched off until a door is opened or 16 
minutes has elapsed after the key is switched off 

• Window load switching is through relays integral of the GM. The GM V monitors 
the current draw for end limit position. The maximum run time for the window 
motors is limited to 8 seconds. This allows the motors to be switched off if the 
end limit load sensing fails. 



35 

Power Wind0ws/E52 



Slide Switch Window Switch 


New Style Window Switches 

The Z8 power window switch design is a new rocker type switch. The switch 

provides the GM V with the familiar coded ground signaling strategy as previous two wire 

switches. 

Pushing a switch to the first detent and holding provides a single ground signal on one 
wire requesting the GM to operate the window motor in the down direction. When 
released, the ground signal is removed and the window motor stops. 

Momentarily pushing the switch to the second detent and releasing provides an 
additional ground signal on the second wire requesting the “one touch mode”, operating 
the window motor automatically. The motor runs the window down until it reaches it's 
end stop. 

The switch functions in the same manner for the upward run of the window motor {driver 
side only)but the ground signal sequencing is reversed. 

The drivers side switch block contains a slide switch for the mirrors, this also affects the 
windows. If the slide switch is set to the left, the left window will be controlled. If the slide 
switch is set to the right, the right window will be controlled. If the slide switch is set to 
the middle position, both windows will be controlled from the driver's window switch.

Power Window Motors 


The window motors are mounted on the cable regulators. The window motor control cir¬ 
cuit consists of two wires for operating the motor in both directions. 

The motors are activated by relays in the GM. The relays provide either power or ground 
depending on the direction of window travel. 

The GM controls the polarity of the based on a request to run the window (window 
switch, Convenience Opening/Closing). 

The windows are run to their limit stops which is detected by an amperage increase in 
the control circuit. Additionally, the window run cycle is limited to an 8 second duration if 
in case the amperage increase is not detected or there is a malfunction with the regula¬ 
tor. 


Window Motor Limit Stop Function 

If the repetitive window activation (up/down) exceeds one minute, the GM deactivates the 
internal relays and disregards any further input requests. The GM provides motor activa¬ 
tion after a short duration but not for the full one minute monitoring cycle. 

Over time, the GM slowly reverses the stored count of activation until the stored number 
equals 0.

Electronic Steering Lock (ELV) 



Purpose of the System 

On historical cars and race cars the starter has a remote button separate from the igni¬ 
tion switch. 

In the Z8, this operating concept has been enhanced by the latest technology in the form 
of the electronic steering lock system (ELV). 

The advantages of this system are that the steering lock and ignition switch can be 
relocated in a safe location (security), the starter button is located in an ergonomical¬ 
ly optimum position for the driver, and the steering column lock is released by EWS 
recognition. 





38 

ELV/E52 
















System Components 


The ELV unit is mounted on the steering 
column as shown to the right. It is 
secured with sheer bolts, and is not ser¬ 
viceable. The ELV must be replaced as a 
unit 

The ELV assembly contains the control 
module and steering lock mechanism. 

The steering lock consist of the mechani¬ 
cal locking motor to engage or release 
the locking plate, and the safety release 
actuator (solenoid) to maintain the locking 
plate position in the event of power loss 
during operation.

Multiple Restrain System - MRS III 


Purpose of the System 

The Z8 is equipped with the Multiple Restraint System (MRS III) which employs the use 
of “SMART” technology. Smart technology refers to the control module’s programming 
which allows for the deployment of the airbags, in stages, depending on the severity of 
the impact. Two stage airbags are used for both the driver and passenger which allows 
for a softer cushioning effect when the bags are triggered at lighter impacts. 

MRS III control modules are manufactured by either Bosch or Temic. While the functional 
operation of both modules are the same. The control modules are not interchangeable 
from a replacement standpoint. Always refer to the EPC parts system to ensure that the 
proper module is installed in the vehicle. 


In addition to the use of two stage airbags for the driver and passenger, the 
following features are also included in the MRS III system: 

• The MRS 111 control module is linked to the K-Bus for coding and diagnosis. 

• The MRS III includes a fuel pump cut off feature in the event of an airbag deployment. 

• Inert gas generators are now used for all air bags and seat belt tensioners. 

• The inert gas is a mixture of hydrogen (13.5%) and oxygen (86.5%). 


45 

Multiple Restrain System/E52 


System Component 

MRS III Control Module 

The control module is mounted in the center console area on the driveshaft tunnel. 

The control module contains the processing electronics (Smart Technology) for 
triggering of all air bags and pyrotechnic devices installed in the vehicle. 

Two electronic deceleration sensors are installed in the module for crash or impact 
detection. 



Satelite Sensors 

The satellite sensors are mounted behind the driver's and passenger’s seats underneath 
the Navigation and cd storage compartments. The function of the sensors is to detect 
the severity of side impacts and signal the MRS III control module, through a pulse mod¬ 
ulated signal, in the event of a crash. The control module uses this input signal along with 
its internal impact sensor signal to determine the deployment of the side/head airbags. 

As with the control modules, the satellite sensors are manufacturer specific. The Temic 
sensors have a three wire connector which will not interchange with the Bosch sensors. 
Only two of the wires are used for the satellite sensor’s operation. The signal for deploy¬ 
ment of the bags is carried over the power wire of the sensor. 



46 

Multiple Restrain Sy$tem/E52 







Driver’s Front Air Bag 

With the MRS III system, the driver’s front airbag becomes a two stage bag similar to the 
passenger’s front side bag, introduced on the 1999 model E38/E39S. The complete 
assembly is mounted beneath the cover in the center of the steering wheel as with 
previous airbags. The assembly now contains the inert gas generator chamber and 
two ignition stages (ignitors). 

The airbag consists of: 

• Accumulator/gas generator 

• Two ignition capsules 

• Propellant gas -13.5% hydrogen 

86.5% oxygen 


To remove the airbag - compress the spring latches 
through the two access holes (at the bag base, next 
to the steering wheel spokes). 



Passenger’s Front Air Bag 

The passenger’s front airbag is the same unit as installed on E38/E39 vehicles as of 9/98 
production. 


The passenger’s airbag consists of: 



• Pressure accumulator/gas generator 

• Two ignition capsules - for two stage activation 

• Propellant gas of - 13.5% hydrogen 

86.5% oxygen 


Side Air Bags (Thorax) 


The side airbags continue to be mounted in the door 
panels on the doors. Deployment of the side airbags 
is dependent on the triggering thresholds pro 
grammed in the MRS III control module, based on the 
inputs from the satellite sensors and internal crash sensor. 
The side airbags use the same cold gas inflation method 
as the driver’s and passenger’s front bags.

Multiple Restrain System/E52 









System Operation 


As with previous systems, the triggering thresholds are programmed in the MRS III 

control module. These thresholds are determined by BMW through crash and vehicle 

testing during the design and development of the vehicle. These thresholds will vary 

depending on the vehicle size and design. 

There are several different thresholds for airbag and safety restraint deployment including: 

• Belt pre-tensioner threshold for activation of the seat belt tensioners. 

• Airbag threshold #1 - the first level of activation for the two stage front 
airbags, always deployed first when the front triggering threshold is reached. 

• Airbag threshold #2 - the second level of the two stage front airbags, can 
be deployed simultaneously or after a time delay, depending on the severity of 
the impact. 

• Rear crash threshold - for activation of the seatbelt tensioners with a rear impact. - 

• Battery safety terminal threshold - for activation of the BST with airbag deployment. 

• Side airbag threshold - for deployment of the side (thorax) airbags. 


Triggering Thresholds - Two Stage Air Bags 

The programming of the MRS III includes four triggering thresholds for the two stage front 
airbags. The triggering of the front airbags is also dependent on whether the seat belts 
are connected and if the front passenger seat is occupied.

• If the signal from the SBE is defective on triggering, the MRS III will deploy as if the 
seat is occupied. 

• If the signal from the seat belt contacts are defective, the MRS III will deploy as if the 
belts were not buckled. 


Triggering Threshold - Side Air Bags 

The triggering thresholds for the side airbags is dependent on the signals from the satel¬ 
lite sensors and the crash sensor in the MRS III control module. The triggering thresholds 
are independent of the belt tensioners. 


Triggering Threshold - Belt Tensioner 

The triggering of the belt tensioners is dependent on the signal from the seat belt contact 
and the severity of the impact as detected by the control module. 


Triggering Threshold - Battery Safety Terminal 

The BST will deploy in a frontal impact at threshold 2 or greater. The threshold for BST 
activation with a side impact is programmed separately in the side deployment criteria. 
The BST will also be deployed when the rear impact threshold is exceeded. 


Triggering Threshold - Fuel Pump Shut Down 

New to the MRS III system is the link via the K-Bus/CAN Bus to the Engine Control Module 
for deactivation of the fuel pump. The MRS III will signal the DME over the K-Bus through 
the IKE and CAN Bus to shut off the fuel pump in the event that any crash threshold is 
exceeded.

CONTROL 


Diagnosis 

Diagnosis and troubleshooting of the MRS III system is fault driven and can be accessed 
using the DIS Tester or MoDiC. The control module performs a self test of the system 
every time the ignition is switched on (this includes the satellite sensors and seat 
occupancy sensor). Any faults with the system will cause the warning lamp in the 
instrument cluster to remain illuminated after the engine is started. 

Installation of a new or replacement control module requires ZCS coding also using the 
DIS or MoDiC. 

When servicing or replacing any MRS III components, always follow precautionary 
measures outlined in the repair manual of TIS. this includes disconnecting the 
battery prior to any repair or maintenance work being performed. 

All airbag components are part number specific by model and require verification in the 
EPC to ensure the correct component is being installed.

Light Technology 


Purpose of The System 

As a technical innovation in addition to the classic appearance, neon light technology is 
used in the Z8 for the external light systems. Neon light technology is used for the 
direction indicator, brake light and reversing light functions. 

Neon tubes are used in the tail lights and direction indicator lights instead of light bulbs. 
The neon tubes are activated by means of special ignition control units controlled by 
the LCM. 

Fiber optic technology is used for the side indicator lamps (same principle as E38 
entrance area lighting). 

The remaining vehicle light systems in the Z8 use the xenon light for the low beam head¬ 
light and halogen light for the high beam headlight. 

As on other new BMW models, all light functions are controlled by a central light con¬ 
trol unit (LCM). Car memory allows Day time and “follow me home” lighting (pull the high 
beam stalk back briefly).

These lights are red. They have the dual function of direction indicators and stop lights. 
The outer brake lights also have the dual function of direction indicators and stop 
lights. 

The dual function is used when braking with the direction indicators active. 

• Direction indicator and hazard lights have priority over brake lights. 

• The light monitoring (LCM) has been extended to incorporate the outer brake lights. 


Note: Neon light fault codes can be read out from the LCM via the DIS/MoDIC. 



Light Technoiogy/E52 






















Neon Technology 

Background 

Neon (symbol Ne) produces a glow in a vacuum electric-discharge tube and is used 
extensively in the familiar advertising displays. 

A neon light is a glass bulb or tube containing neon (gasseous element) at low pressure, 
and two metallic electrodes. To make a neon light, the tube is bent while warmed, to the 
desired shape and sealed at both ends. During the sealing process, electrodes are 
added at each end. An access port is left near one end and a vacuum is applied to the 
interior of the tube. After the air and humidity has been removed, the neon gas is added 
under low pressure and the tube is sealed. 

The light produces a reddish-orange glow when an electric current (applied across the 
electrodes) is raised in voltage to the point at which it ionizes the gas in the tube. The 
voltage at which the light glows varies with the design of the tube. When the glass tube is 
ionized, the voltage drop across the tube is constant, regardless of the amount of current 
flowing through the tube. The neon glows with an even intensity throughout the length of 
the tube. 

A variant of this is the glass tube containing ionized neon at very low pressure. The tube 
shines with a brilliant red glow if a high-voltage alternating current is applied to the elec¬ 
trodes sealed in the ends of the tube. 


With chemistry and electrical changes, neon lights can produce an amber color, This 
allows the application for front turning/parking lights.

Neon Benefits 

The use of neon lighting provides several advantages to automobile manufacturers and 
consumers: 

* Light failures caused by shock and vibration are minimized, because neon operates 
without a filament. 

* The average life of the light is considerably higher as compared to incandescent bulbs. 

* Styling of the light includes a more uniform distribution of light across the lense, and 
neon tubes can be bent to conform to the contour of the vehicle. 

* Amber neon allows the use of a clear lense (for vehicle color schemes). 


* Neon enhances safety because of the extremely fast ignition time of the light (instant¬ 
aneous braking signal), allowing other drivers more time to react. 



The neon lights are activated directly by the LCM. The neon tubes have ignition control units 
on each housing. 

Note: Due to extremely high internal voltage, internal testing is not permitted. Please refer 
to the repair information before testing or servicing.

Side Direction Indicator - Fiber Optics 

The side directional indicator lighting is provided by halogen bulb light sources in each 
base of the “A” pillars, and fiber optic tubing. The light sources are controlled directly by 
the LCM, when the directional signal is activated. 

Light Source Modules: Mounted in each “A” pillar base, behind the lower dash trim, are 
the light source modules. The light source modules are made up of the housing, halogen 
bulb and reflector. 



The reflector holds the bulb and focus the bulbs light into the housing. The bulbs are are 
available for individual replacement (P/N 63 31 8 371 610). 

Fiber Optic Light Conductor Cable: The fiber optic cables carry the light to their respective 
light housing in each front fender (through the engine compartment bulkhead).

Light Control Module - LCM 


The neon and fiber optic lights are directly activated by the LCM. 

The LCM is located behind the carpet and protection plate on the passenger’s side, 
below the glovebox. 

The LCM is diagnoseable via DIS/MoDIC, and requires coding when replaced (refer to 
IKE section). 




Light Technology/E52 












Xenon Lights 

• The automotive industry/press often identify xenon lighting systems as HID (high 
intensity discharge) systems. Xenon headlight technology was first introduced to the 
US market exclusively on the E32 750iL in 1993. BMW xenon headlight systems have 
evolved and their availability as optional equipment has spread through out the model 
lineup. 

• Blue/White in color and using ellipsoidal technology Xenon headlights pro 
vide improved night time visibility in all driving conditions compared with traditional 
Halogen bulb headlights. 



Xenon High Intensity Discharge Bulbs 

* Xenon bulbs are identified as D2S(D=Discharge). Xenon bulbs illuminate when an arc 
of electrical current is established between two electrodes in the bulb. 

• The xenon gas sealed in the bulb reacts to the electrical excitation and 
heat generated by the current flow. The distinct bluish/white brilliant light is the 
result of the xenon gas reacting to the controlled current flow. 


58 

Light Technology/E52 


vi : > : : 


Phases of Bulb Operation 

Starting Phase: The bulb requires an initial high voltage starting pulse of 18-25kV to 
establish the arc. 

Warm Up Phase: Once the arc is established the power supply to the bulb is regulated to 
2.6A generating a lamp output of 75 watts. This is the period of operation where the 
xenon gas begins to brightly illuminate. The warm up phase stabilizes the environment in 
the bulb ensuring continual current flow across the electrodes. 

Continuous Phase: Once the warm up phase is completed, the system switches to a 
continuous mode of operation. The supply voltage for the bulb is reduced and the 
operating power required for continual bulb illumination is reduced to 35 watts which is 
less than a conventional halogen bulb. 


Functional Description 

• To regulate the power supply to the bulbs, additional components are required. The 
xenon control modules (1 per light) receive operating power from the lighting control 
module (LCM) when the headlights are switched on. The xenon control modules 
provide the regulated power supply to illuminate the bulbs through their phases 
of operation. 

• The igniters establish the electric arcs. Integral coils generate the initial high voltage 
starting pulses from the control module provided starting voltage. Thereafter 
they provide a closed circuit for the regulated power output from the control modules.

Xenon Bulb Monitoring 

• Xenon bulb function is monitored by the Lighting Control Module (LCM). The 
bulbs are only "hot" monitored. Cold monitoring is not possible since the lighting 
control module is not in direct control of the xenon bulb. For this reason cold moni 
toring for low beam headlights is encoded off in the lighting control module for 
Xenon headlight equipped vehicle. 

• The lighting control module detects xenon bulb failure via a reduction in current flow 
to the xenon control module. When a bulb fails, the xenon control module’s current 
consumption drops to 60mA indicating unsuccessful xenon bulb illumination. The 
lighting control module then posts the appropriate display message. 


Diagnosis 

• Xenon control modules are not connected to the diagnostic link. However, the vehicle 
specific Lighting Control Module (LCM) does incorporate xenon headlight specific 
diagnosis up to the xenon control module. 


Xenon Headlight Testing 

Warning: Xenon headlight control systems generate high output voltage. Prior to headlight 
removal or testing observe the vehicle warning labels and be cautious by following 
safeguards to prevent accidental injury. 

Refer to SI 04 33 96 for detailed adapter introductory information.

Headlight Beam Throw Control - LRA 


• LRA automatically adjusts the vertical positioning of the headlights to maintain 
optimum headlight beam positioning for maximum driving visibility and to prevent 
undue glare for oncoming motorists. The system compensates for vehicle load angle 
changes (ie: diminishing reserve of gasoline in fuel tank during a long journey, over 
loaded cargo weight, etc.) 

• LRA has been available on BMW vehicles (refered to as LWR) in other markets for 
quite some time. Starting with the 1999 model year all US market vehicles with Xenon 
Lights incorporate LWR as standard equipment, now included in the new Z8 (refer to 
1999 Model Update for specifics). 

• LRA monitors the vehicle’s loaded angle via two hall effect sensors mounted to the 
front and rear suspension members. When an adjustment is necessary, LRA 
simultaneously activates two stepper motors (one in each headlight assembly). 

• The stepper motors drive a threaded rod that moves the lower edge of the 
headlight carrier plate forward and backward (depending on driven direction). 

The upper edge of the headlight carrier plate is fixed on a pivot. The pivoting 
movement adjusts the vertical position of the headlight beam. 



Control Module 

The LRA control module is located behind the glovebox. The control module connects to 
a single, harness connector. The control module has diagnostic capabilities and commu¬ 
nicates with the DIS/MoDiC via the K bus - IKE gateway to the D bus.

The S62B50 is a 4-valve per cylinder dual VANOS naturally aspirated engine with high 
torque and high-rev concepts. High torque is developed by a large volume engine at low 
engine rpm and a long total gear ratio. High-rev is achieved with a small displacement 
lightweight” (internal components) engine and short total gear ratio. This powertrain pro¬ 
vides the best of both worlds by using a 5 Liter 32 valve V8 configuration coupled to a 6

System Components 
Engine Block 


Cylinder Bank Numbering 
From Engine Front 


The S62 engine block is manufactured from Alusil as 
aluminum alloy pressure die-casting. The cylinder walls 
are finished by an etching process only. 

The water cooling passageways of the block incorpo¬ 
rate a connection in the “V" of the block for an oil/water 
heat exchanger. 

The bore of the block is 94 mm. This along with a 
stroke of 89 mm gives the S62 engine a displacement 
of 5 liters. There is 3 mm between the cylinder bores 
of the engine. The “bare” block weighs approximately 
71 lbs. (32 kg.) 



Crankshaft and Bearings: The crankshaft is 
forged steel with five main bearing journals (70 
mm diameter) and the thrust bearing on number 
five journal. 


The S62 bearings are identified by the “triple 
classification” system. The bearing shell thick¬ 
ness is marked by "notches” in the crankcase 
and paint markings on the counterweights of 
the crankshaft (refer to the Repair Instructions 
for details). 

Bearing Clearance: 



2. Thrust (end play) 0.085 - 0.257 mm 

__ 


The main bearing caps are secured by four 
bolts each. The outer bolts are “splayed” 
(angled) out to the block adding greater 
strength and support. 

The adjustable hex head must be threaded in 
for installation and then “preloaded” to the block 
(refer to the Repair Instructions for details). 




M Engines - S62B50 













The thrust bearing (#5) is constructed of two 
radial shells and four shims (example shown on 
the right). 

The shim tab must align with the notch in the 
bearing cap. 

Refer to the Repair Instructions for details on 
installing the shims in the engine block. 

The torsional vibration damper is specifically 
designed for the higher engine rpm. 

The damper is secured by 4 “stretch" bolts (#2 
in the diagram, one time use only) which must 
be angle torqued (refer to Repair Instructions 
and Technical Data). 

Note the installation location for the crankshaft 
postion locating special tool (arrow). 




Connecting Rods and Bearings: The S62 

uses reinforced forged steel “cracked” connect¬ 
ing rods with a 53 mm journal diameter. 

The “cracked” connecting rod refers to the cap 
which is split off leaving rough surfaces on both 
the cap and the rod. 



Centering of the cap on the rod is carried out through 
the structure of the split which eliminates the alignment 
sleeves. Pairing codes are stamped into the rod to 
ensure proper installation of the cap. 

The S62 connecting rods are weight-optimized (+/- 4 
grams). Only one set of connecting rods (the same 
weight class) is available to maintain balance. 

The connecting rod bolts are “stretch" type (one time 
use only) which must be angle torqued (refer to Repair 
Instuctions and Technical Data).

Pistons and Piston Rings: The S62 uses short skirt 
design pistons that are coated with a Ferrostan/tin plat¬ 
ing for use with the Alusil block. The piston diameter is 
94mnn. 


The pistons are cooled with oil spray jets, mounted in 
the crankcase. The compression ratio is 11.0 : 1 and 
requires premium unleaded fuel for optimum perfor¬ 
mance. 


The pistons for cylinder bank 1-4 are different from 
cylinder bank 5-8 due to the wrist pin off set. The rele¬ 
vant cylinder bank number is engraved into the piston 
crown using laser technology.

The pistons are cooled by oil spray nozzles that are 
bolted into the crankcase. 

The nozzles are “tapped” into the main oil gallery and 
delivers a constant oil spray to the underside of the pis¬

Engine Oil System 


The oil supply system of the S62B50 engine is specifically designed for the M5 and 28. Due 
to the sport nature and the ability for high speed cornering (transverse acceleration) of up 
to 1.2g, the engine oil could be forced (and trapped) into the outer edge of the cylinder head 
and the rear area of the oil sump. m • - - - 


The main oil pump function is to supply the 
engine with the required volume of oil for all of 
the lubrication needs. 


To prevent oil starvation from occurring during 
these driving situations, two additional scav¬ 
enging oil pumps are installed within the main oil 
pump housing (integral unit).

The two additional pumps only supply the oil 
sump with the scavenged oil.

Solenoid 


Each additional oil pump incorporates a sole¬ 
noid changeover valve that is connected to two 
scavenging tubes routed to the rear section of 
the oil pan and the outer edge of the cylinder 
head. 


The scavenging tubes in the oil pan crossover 
so that the right side pump draws from the rear 
left side of the pan and the left pump from the 
right side of the pan. 


The solenoid changeover valves must be 
removed before attempting to remove the oil 
pan. The valves insert directly into the scavenge 
pump housing through the oil pan. 


The upper oil pan for the Z8 is been modified 
due to the engine and crossmember “clear¬ 
ance" relationship. 


The upper oil pan is contoured around the oil 
pump drive at the front of the engine (arrow). 


M Engines - S62850 













Scavenge Oil Pump(s) Operation: While dri¬ 
ving straight ahead, the two oil pumps draw oil 
from the rear of the oil pan to supply the main oil 
pump pick up. 

The solenoids are de-activated in this situation. 



When cornering at forces > 0.9g, one solenoid 
will be activated by the ECM to draw oil from the 
cylinder head while the second solenoid will 
continue to draw oil from the rear of the pan. 

The ECM receives the signal from the DSC 
Control Module (based on cornering G-force) 
over the CAN Bus line. 



Oil Cooling: The S62 engine is equipped with 
an oil-to-coolant heat exchanger. It is mounted 
in the “V” of the block and serves to heat the oil 
during engine warm up and cool the oil during 
normal driving. Oil and coolant passageways 
are cast into the block. Formed “O” rings are 
used to seal the the heat exchanger. The 
coolant return is through external pipes back to 
the thermostat housing. 



mm 


A differentia! pressure control valve is integrated 
into the heat exchanger on the oil side. The 
valve opens an oil bypass in the event that the 
exchanger should become clogged or at very 
low start temperatures. This ensures that the 
engine will receive sufficient lubrication under all 
driving conditions.

The crankcase blow-by vapors are “purged” by 
intake manifold vacuum. The blow-by vapors 
flow into the intake through two cyclone sepa¬ 
rators. 


The separators are mounted at the left and right 
sides of the intake manifold. The oil conden¬ 
sates are separated and flow directly back to 
the oil sump through feed/return hoses into the 
front timing case covers. 


The crankcase ventilation system is completely 
sealed. Care must be taken when reinstalling 
the cyclone separators in the intake manifold to 
ensure that the radial seal is fully seated. 


If oil collects in the intake manifold, drainage is 
provided from two points at the back of the 
intake manifold lower plenum. 


The drainage points “tee” into an integral return 
passage cast in the intake manifold base as 
shown. An outlet fitting at the front of the mani¬ 
fold connects to a drain hose that allows the oil 
to drain back to the crankcase. 


Drain Outlet 


Engine Cooling 


The S62 coolant flows from the water pump into the block. From here it passes through the 
heat exchanger and cylinder heads. The coolant cross flows through the cylinder heads. 


The coolant returns from the heat exchanger and two return 
pipes from the cylinder heads back into the thermostat hous¬ 
ing. Vehicle heating is also taken from the coolant return pipes 
in the "V” of the block and returns back into the water pump 
housing. 


The S62 engine uses a conventionally heated thermostat (2) 
that opens at 79 0 C and is mounted on top of the waterpump 
housing.

Cylinder Heads 


The S62 features aluminum cross- 
flow cylinder heads designed as 
single components that house the 
camshafts and valve train. 


The four valve (per-cylinder) head 
is a single piece construction. 


The camshaft bearing journal caps 
are machined with the cylinder 
head and are marked intake/ 
exhaust and numbered for loca¬ 
tion. 


HVA {hydraulic compensators) are used to actu¬ 
ate the valves. Valve adjustment is not required. 


The cylinder head uses a cross flow coolant 
design. The coolant enters from the block on the 
exhaust side and exits through three openings 
between the cylinders on the intake side. 


The coolant returns through an external water 
manifold (1) on each cylinder head to the ther¬ 
mostat housing. 


The spark plugs are centrally located in the com¬ 
bustion area for the most effective power and 
reduced emission outputs. 


Refer to the Repair Instructions using the Special (Jci 
Tools for cylinder head pressure testing. 


The cylinder head gasket is a steel version 


Note: Cylinder head machining is not permitted.

Valve Train 

Camshaft Primary Drive: Primary drive is pro¬ 
vided by a double-roller chain from the crank¬ 
shaft to the intake camshafts on both banks. 

The chain is guided by a centrally positioned V- 
shape deflection rail. Additionally, a straight rail 
is used on cylinder bank 5-8 and a curved 
chain tensioner rail with a hydraulic “self adjust¬ 
ing” tensioner on cylinder bank 1 -4. 



Camshaft Secondary Drive: Secondary drive 
is from the intake camshaft to the exhaust cam¬ 
shaft by a single roller chain (arrow). The chain 
is tensioned by a hydro-mechanical “self ad¬ 
justing” tensioner (between the sprockets). 

The oil supply for the chain tensioner also sup¬ 
plies the VANOS hydraulic units through a pres¬ 
sure control valve. 



Camshafts: The four S62 cast iron overhead 
camshafts are hollow and are strengthened by 
heat treating the journals and cam lobes. 

Each camshaft is supported by five bearings 
that are marked intake/exhaust and numbered 
for location. 

The camshafts feature recesses that allow the 
cylinder head bolts to be removed without 
removing the shafts (head bolts 1 through 10 
shown on the right).

For installation and timing procedures, the 
camshafts are held in position by locking pins 
{Special Tools) that are inserted into the front 
camshaft bearing caps on both cylinder heads 
(as shown on the right). 




When performing camshaft timing, a visual 
“sight” is provided on the front cam journal sup¬ 
port cap and in the camshaft journal (for both 
intake and exhaust). 


The two grooves should line up to verify correct 
timing. 


Using an open end wrench to turn camshafts will 
allow the locking pins to be inserted with ease. 
Refer to the Repair Instructions for details on 
camshaft removal, installation and timing. 


Caution: Remove locking pins before rotating 
camshafts! 



mm 


An impulse wheel is mounted on the end of each , intake 
camshaft for position detection (VANOS opera¬ 
tion). The impulse wheels are secured by a 
removeable bolt (1). 


The intake camshaft impulse wheels have 6 lugs 
and the exhaust camshaft impulse wheels have 
7 lugs (including one large lug).

The S62 valves use single conical (tapered) 
valve springs and HVAs (hydraulic compen¬ 
sators) to actuate the valves. Valve adjustment 
is not required. 



The springs are marked for correct installation due to the “cone” shape (paint stripes fac¬ 
ing down towards cylinder head). 


Notes:

M Engines - S62B50 




VANOS 


Performance, torque, idle characteristics and exhaust emissions reduction are improved by 
variable camshaft timing (VANOS). The S62 engine uses a double VANOS system for valve 
timing on both the intake and exhaust camshafts. 



The S62 uses a high pressure (100 Bar) control system that ensures quick and reliable 
adjustments of the camshafts to meet the high performance requirements of the M 
Engines. The VANOS units are mounted directly on the front of the cylinder heads. 


Each VANOS unit contains: 

• High pressure radiaJ oil pump (driven by the 
intake Camshaft) 

• Two inlet solenoids 

• Two outlet solenoids 

• Two adjustment pistons 

• Two hydraulically actuated adjustment shafts 



Two solenoids are required for each adjusting piston circuit, one for advancing and one for 
retarding the camshaft timing. The solenoids are controlled by the ECM.

The adjustment shafts contain two sets of 
splines that engage with: 




Camshaft Sleeves (Straight Splines) 


Chain Driven Sprocket (Helical Splines)

The adjustment shafts have a total stroke of 25 


mm. 


The camshaft sleeves are bolted to the end of 
the camshafts and engage with the straight 
spline of the adjustment shaft shown above. 


The chain driven sprocket and spacer sleeve 
assembly is shown to the right (one assembly 
per camshaft). The sprocket engages with the a 

helical splines of the adjustment shaft shown yg J 

above. 


The intake camshaft sprocket assembly has two 
drive "lugs” that must be aligned with the radial 
piston oil pump during installation. 


16 

M Engines - S62B50 




nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnonnnnnnnnoonnono-nn oooc 



VANOS mechanical operation is dependent on oil pressure applied to position the control 
pistons. The double VANOS camshafts are infinitely adjustable within the mechanical trav¬ 
el limits of the drive gears. 

When oil pressure is applied to the control piston, the piston moves causing the splined 
adjustment shaft to move. The straight splines slide within the camshaft sleeve. The helical 
splines rotate the camshaft drive sprocket changing the position in relation to the camshaft 
position which advances/retards the camshaft timing. 



The total adjustment range of the camshafts is 60‘ (as referenced! 1 to the crankshaft)

100 Bar Pressure Regulating Valve: The 100 

Bar pressure regulating valve regulates the pres¬ 
sure produced by the radial piston high pressure 
oil pumps. 


18 

M Engines ■ S62B50 


Oil is supplied from the main gallery through the 
front of cylinder head (arrow) to the inlet pres¬ 
sure reducing valve. 


Pressure Reducing Valve: The pressure 
reducing valve supplies oil to the radial piston 
high pressure oil pump. It is located between 
the cylinder head and the VANOS unit. 


The 100 Bar pressure regulating valve is mount¬ 
ed in the center of the cylinder block “V” on the 
thermostat housing. 


The valve ensures that the oil pressure for 
VANOS operation is maintained at 100 bar. One 
pressure regulator is used for both cylinder 
banks. 


Note: The 100 Bar pressure regulating valve is 
not adjustable. 
























VANOS Accumulator: The VANOS accumulator 
ensures that there is a sufficient volume of oil under 
pressure to adjust the camshafts under all engine oper¬ 
ating conditions. 

The accumulator is Nitrogen charged and is located on 
the front of the 5 - 8 bank of the engine. It is connected 
to the VANOS oil pressure circuit by a high pressure 
line. 



VANOS Accumulator with Electrical Shutoff Valve: 

The VANOS accumulator with an electrical shutoff valve 
was phased into production on 2001 MY S62 engines. 

This production change addresses the customer com¬ 
plaint of a rattling noise (from the VANOS units) in the 
first few seconds after starting the engine. The VANOS 
hydraulics can cause rattling noises after the engine 
start due to the varying torque of the camshaft before 
sufficient VANOS oil pressure has built up. 

When the engine is stopped, the oil runs out of the 
high-pressure chamber in the adjustment cylinder. This 
can cause the VANOS adjustment piston to move freely 
against the housing during startup. 



The shutoff valve prevents this because it will close (without electrical power) to reserve a 
volume of oil under pressure in the accumulator when the igniton is switched off. Upon the 
next engine start, the valve will be opened by the ECM allowing the stored accumulator 
release to “prime" the VANOS assemblies with pressurized oil. 

This noise has no effect on the engine's power output or durability. 

The affected vehicles are: Manufacturing period: 

• E39 (M5), E52 (Z8) • From the start of series production up to November 2000 

In case of customer complaint on vehicles produced before 12/2000, Refer to the Service 
Information Bulletin. A shutoff valve may be retrofitted to the VANOS accumulator. 

Note: There are two different retrofit kits depending on the vehicle production date. 

• Retrofitting on vehicles from start of series production until August 2000. 

• Retrofitting on vehicles from September 2000 until November 2000. 


19 

M Engines - S62B50 
























Pressure 



VANOS system hydraulic operation: 

• When the engine starts, oil from the main engine oil pump is fed under pressure to the 
pressure reducing valves. 

• The oil pressure is dropped to approximately 0.5 Bar and fed to the radial piston high 
pressure oil pumps. 

• The pumps are driven by the intake camshafts and the 100 bar pressure is built up by 
the pressure regulating valve. The volume of pressurized oil is stored in the accumulator 
supplying both adjustment pistons. Both pistons are held in the default position by the 
high pressure oil. 

• At the same time the high pressure oil is available at the inlet solenoids of both adjust¬ 
ment pistons. 


20 

M Engines - S62650 





nnnnoooonnnnonnonoooO0nn000nn0000n0n0nn^0n 



• VANOS adjustment is carried out by the ECM pulsing the inlet and outlet solenoids to 
allow pressurized oil to the back side of the adjustment pistons. The surface area on this 
side of the piston is larger so that the oil pressure is greater and the adjustment piston 
will move causing the valve timing to change. 


• The piston is connected to the adjustment shaft. As the piston moves, the shaft turns 
the helical splines varying the camshaft sprocket position in relation to the camshafts. 

From 12/00 Production Date 


• When the ignition is switched “off" the shutoff valve will close (without electrical power) to 
reserve a volume of oil under pressure in the accumulator, Upon the next engine start, 
the valve will be opened by the ECM allowing the stored accumulator release to "prime” 
the VANOS assemblies with pressurized oil. 


CAUTION! 

• The VANOS system is under high pressure (100 Bar). 

• The VANOS accumulator stores pressurized oil, do not energize the Shutoff VaJve when 
the oil circuit (lines) is open! 

• Consult the Repair instructions before performing any repairs.

Intake Air Plenum: The large intake air plenum is designed for the maximum volume 
required for the S62 engine. Inside the intake plenum, each throttle valve has its own air 
funnel which is bolted to the individual throttle housing. 





The air funnel positions are defined by the 
shape of the plenum. The funnels for cylinders 
1 and 5 face rearward and the remaining fun¬ 
nels face inward. 


The lower plenum is sealed to the upper cover 
by a perimeter gasket and four “o-rings” on the 
center support towers. 


Caution: Remove attaching nuts and store 
away from intake plenum before lifting funnels 
from the throttle housings so they do not fall 
into the throttle housings! 














Intake Air System: The S62 engine uses eight individual throttle housings that are bolted 
directly to the cylinder heads. To ensure smooth and stable engine operation all eight throt¬ 
tles must be synchronized for an even distribution of the intake air. 



One bank of four shown 
















Refer to the Repair Instructions for the procedure to adjust and synchronize the throttle 
housings. 



22 

M Engines - S62B50 









Electronic Throttle Motor (EDR): All eight 
throttles are activated by one electric throttle 
motor (EDR). 

The EDR motor is mounted in the “V” of the 
block and controls the throttles through two 
linkages. The ECM controls the EDR to open 
and close the throttle valves. 

The throttle valves are fitted with mechanical 
return springs to close them when the EDR is 
not energized. 



Idle Speed Actuator: A separate idle speed 
actuator (ZWD 5) is used to supply the idle air to 
all cylinders. The actuator supplies air to the 
base of the throttle housings which bypasses 
the throttle valves (plates) to maintain engine 
idle speed. 

The idle speed actuator is mounted in the “V” of 
the block and is connected to the throttle valves 
through large air pipes linked between each 
throttle housing. 




Fuel Supply: The fuel is supplied through a Non Return Fuel Rail System. This system is 
used on the S62 for TLEV compliancy. The fuel supply pressure is controlled by the 5 Bar 
fuel pressure regulator integrated in the fuel filter assembly (pressure test fitting at this 
point). The E39 M5 fuel filter assembly is located under the left front floor area (next to the 
frame rail). 


The fuel exits the fuel pressure regulator supply¬ 
ing even fuel distribution to all fuel injectors due 
to a connection feeding both fuel rails. 


The fuel return line is located on the filter/regu¬ 
lator assembly which directs the unused fuel 
back to the fuel tank. The fuel tank hydrocar¬ 
bons are reduced by returning the fuel from this 
point instead of from the fuel rail. 


23 

M Engines - S62B50 














The Non Return Fuel Rails are secured to the 
throttle housings by two bolts (for each shown 
to the right #1). 

The fuel rails provide even distribution and a vol¬ 
ume of fuel for the injectors. 


Clutch Assembly: The S62 clutch assembly is 
specially designed to transfer the high torque to 
the driveline and dampen vibrations throughout 
the rpm range. 


The clutch assembly consists of: 



The incremental wheel is mounted to the fly¬ 
wheel for the engine speed, reference and Mis¬ 
fire Detection. The self adjusting clutch (SAC) 
has lower release forces for easier clutch oper¬ 
ation (less pedal effort required). 





1 FH3 073 



Procedures for checking and replacing the seif adjustment dutch including the Special 
Tools are found in the Repair instructions. 


Exhaust System: The exhaust manifolds are stainless steel with an air gap insulation that 
allows the converters to warm up rapidly and reach their operating temperature. 



Two metal monolith catalytic converters are 
used with pre and post catalyst oxygen sensors 
for OBD II compliance. 

The left side catalyst contains an Exhaust Gas 
Temperature Sensor on vehicles produced up 
to 9/2000. Vehicles produced >9/2000 do not 
have this sensor. Refer to the Service Infor¬ 
mation Bulletin on modifying early production- 
vehicles.

nnnnnnnnoonnnnnnnonnonooonnoooononoooonooooooo 



The exhaust is combined in the one piece cen¬ 


tral silencer with two outlet openings at the rear 
which lead to the two main silencers. 


Main Silencers: Four main silencers with indi¬ 
vidual outlets are used on the M5 to comply 
with international noise emission regulations. 




Due to the positioning and space requirements 
for the silencers, the floor pan of the luggage 
compartment is redesigned and the spare 
wheel has been eliminated. 

The battery is mounted in the luggage compart¬ 
ment floor between the rear silencers as shown 
on the right. 

The Z8 uses two rear silencers with individual 



outlets 


For production purposes, the stainless steel 
exhaust system is a one piece component after 
the exhaust manifolds. 


For repair purposes, the system is separated 
and sleeved in sections at specific points.

Running Gear/E52 



Front Axle 

The Z8 front suspension is designed as a dou¬ 
ble pivot with spring over strut. 

The axle principle of the E39 and E38 models 
has been re-engineered in order to achieve 
the desired sports and roadster-specific char¬ 
acteristics. 

The front axle carrier is a welded aluminum 
structure consisting of extruded sections 
and reinforcement panels. 

The front axle carrier is connected to the body 
by 6 bolted points. 

The tension struts are also forged aluminum. 

Hydraulic rubber mounts have been installed 
{tension rod bushings) in order to reduce axle 
vibration. 

The struts are clamped to the spindle hub 
unit. 

The upper pivot bearings (plates) are made of 
aluminum. 

Suspension 

The front struts are equipped with gas 
pressure shock absorbers. 

The spring tuning is approx. 18%stiffer 
than on sedans. Due to the harder spring 
tuning, the spring compression range is 
70 mm. 

The anti-sway bar is 27 mm in diameter. 
This suspension design allows a low hood line 
to be achieved. 





Running Gear/E52 




Steering 




The Z8 is equipped with power assisted 
rack and pinion steering. 

The steering gear is located in front of the 
wheel center and subframe cross mem¬ 
ber. This combination ensures correct 
steering characteristics and steering line 
accuracy. 

The variable ratio of the steering gear 
provides a responsive feel under all driv¬ 
ing conditions. 



The Z8 is not equipped with Servotronic. 


Rear Axle 

The concept of the Z8 rear axle is known 
from the E38. The rear axle carrier is made 
of steel, similar to the carrier installed in 
the E38. 

The rear axle is connected to the body by 
large-volume rubber mounts. Ball bearings 
are used in the lower control arm pivots, 
allowing for the hard longitudinal and 
transverse acceleration forces. 

Suspension 

Struts with centrally positioned springs are 
fitted on the rear axle. 



The spring tuning is approx. 25% 
harder than on the E38 sedan. The 
spring compression range is 80 mm. 

A 14 mm diameter anti-sway bar is 
standard.

arrangement. The brake system has been adopted and modified from the E38 
security vehicle. 

• The front brakes are designed as a dual-piston floating calipers, and the rear 

brakes are single-piston floating calipers. 

• The rotors feature a special coating (Geomet), improving corrosion resistance.

BMW ALPINA ROADSTER V8 



































































BMW ALPINA ROADSTER V8 


This new Z8 is not only from BMW, but also from ALPINA. Located in the Upper Bavarian 
town of Buchloe, ALPINA was established in 1964 as an official and approved "ennobler" 
of BMW automobiles - and with that word, we unabashedly translate directly from the 
German word Veredler, which tells us that ALPINA is not concerned merely with making 
BMWs go faster and look racier. 

Instead, ALPINA's tradition is to take production BMWs and make them even more appeal¬ 
ing to connoisseurs of automotive finery. Performance finery, we must add, as ALPINA's 
treatments include not merely cosmetic modifications but also a palette of powertrain and 
chassis refinements that consistently enhance BMW models' already formidable road capa¬ 
bilities within a context of thorough engineering and mature character. 

With this latest creation, which amounts to an exclusive and unique ALPINA re-interpreta¬ 
tion of the Z8 roadster, the team of automotive ennoblers has added its unique touch to an 
already classic creation, and has done so with the skill and maturity of the seasoned auto¬ 
motive gourmet. The BMW ALPINA ROADSTER V8 incorporates change not just for the 
sake of change and exclusivity - although of course it offers exclusivity in great measure - 
but rather as a specific, targeted refinement in the direction of greater comfort.

BMW ALPINA ROADSTER V8 











What ALPINA has created - and how 


; 

1 


ALPINA has transformed the Z8 in a thoroughly 
logical way, consistent with its own long-stand¬ 
ing principles and the tastes preferences. 

Toward an understanding of the ALPINA trans¬ 
formation of the Z8, it is helpful to look at the 
ways in which the ALPINA roadster differs from 
the original Z8 - whose limited production con¬ 
cludes today with a total of approximately 5,000 
units having been largely handbuilt. 



Engine 

Most dramatically, the BMW ALPINA ROADSTER V8 replaces the Z8's BMW M engine 
(5.0 liters, 394 horsepower, elaborate individual throttles for each of the eight cylinders 
and many other racecar-like engineering characteristics) with a performance-developed 
version of BMW's "regular" V-8 engine. 

Remarkably, the 4.8-liter ALPINA engine comes 
to wrthin 19 hp of the BMW M unit (375 hp, vs. 

394), does so at lower rpm levels, and (this is 
key) is thus suited to teaming with an automat¬ 
ic transmission. 

Its power peak comes at 5800 rpm, vs. 6600; 
its torque peak occurs at the same 3800 rpm 
but is actually higher: 383 Ib-ft. (vs. 368 Ib-ft). 

The ALPINA engine delivers at least 368 Ib-ft. all 
the way from 3100 to 5000 rpm. 

The cast-aluminum cylinder heads' intake and exhaust ports are polished, the entire hand 
assembled engine, differs from the existing M62 V-8 engine variations as follows: 

• The cylinder block, as cast by BMW in Alusil (aluminum-silicon alloy), has 93.0-mm cylin¬ 
der bores. This is 1.0 mm greater than those of the 4.4i engine, and shared with the X5 
4.6is engine. 

• The crankshaft, with 89.0-mm stroke, is almost identical to that of the M5/Z8 engine; this 
stroke is 6.3 mm greater than that of the 4.4 engine, and 4.0 mm greater than that of 
the 4.6. The combination of 93.0-mm bore and 89.0-mm stroke produces a

displacement of 4837 cc, vs. the 4.4's 4396 and the 4.6's 4619. 

• ALPINA-specific lightweight aluminum pistons from Mahle, the famous German produc¬ 
er of pistons and other internal engine components. 

• ALPINA-specific connecting rods, camshafts and valves. 

• ALPINA-specific intake manifold, with increased volume and more sensitive air-mass 
sensors. 



Transmission 

In another significant departure from the original 
Z8, and in harmony with the new engine, the 6- 
speed manual transmission is replaced by a 
special BMW ALPINA automatic transmission. 

Based on the 5-speed ZF unit employed in V8- 
powered 5 and X5 Series models, the ALPINA 
version differs in several major aspects: 

• In addition to up and downshifting by "tipping" the shift lever rearward or forward, the dri¬ 
ver can also shift by pressing "+" and buttons near the steering-wheel rim. 



•1st and 2nd gears are strengthened to handle the engine's higher torque. (Up to now, 
the largest, highest-torque V-8 teamed with this transmission has been that of the X5 
4.6is.) 

• Directly in front of the driver, a transmission display instrument indicates the range (P, R, 
N, D), mode (Automatic or Manual) and the gear currently engaged. 

• Transmission software is unique to this unit. 

• Under wide-open throttle in its Automatic mode (D), the unit upshifts at 5800 rpm, the 
engine's power peak. In its Manual mode (M), shifting is under the driver's control but it 
will upshift at 6500 rpm to prevent engine overspeed. 


Wheels and Tires 




Also dramatic: special BMW ALPINA 20-inch wheels, with five clusters of four spokes each. 
With 9.0-in. width at the front and 10.0 at the rear, these wheels are an inch wider at the 
front and carry Y-rated performance tires of dimensions 255/35R-20 at the front and 
285/30R-20 at the rear. Z8 wheels and tires are 18-inchers, the tires being 245/45 at the 
front and 275/40 at the rear.

Y-rated performance tires are a departure from Z8 practice too. The Z8 wears W-rated run- 
flat (also performance) tires; the ALPINA's tires balance their lower profile (which implies firm 
sidewalls) against Z8's higher-profile, but still relatively stiff run-flat sidewalls. (20-in. run-flat 
tires would have been unacceptably harsh-riding.) At the bottom line, sensitive drivers will 
find the BMW ALPINA ROADSTER V8 to deliver increased riding comfort with at least com¬ 
parable handling. 

For the eventuality of a flat tire, the ALPINA model employs the BMW Mobility System, 
familiar from BMW M models. BMW Mobility consists of a container of rapid sealant, an 
integrated micro-compressor, and a hose to connect the compressor to the damaged tire. 
All this is carried in a trunk recess near the right rear wheel, designed into the Z8 right from 
the start. The system can seal punctures up to approximately 1/4 in. across. 


Interior 



Retaining the Z8's power telescopic adjustment, the BMW ALPINA ROADSTER V8 adopts 
a different steering wheel, with three leather-and-metal-finished spokes in place of the Z8's 
"banjo" spokes. An ALPINA logo replaces the BMW emblem on the steering wheel's cen¬ 
ter hub. 


The cockpit is upholstered in Soft Nappa (distinctive from the 
Z8‘s Nappa), with special piping and ALPINA logos in the 
upper seatback. Three color schemes are offered: 
Black/Black, Black/Crema and Black/Sport Red. 


As its name implies, the ALPINA interior's Soft Nappa leather is somewhat more pliant than 
the Z8's already luxurious Nappa leather. The three color combinations correspond to three 
of the Z8's four; special piping, the ALPINA steering wheel and the ALPINA logos in the 
seat upholstery add further distinction. 

So does the plaque between the seats, which documents each vehicle’s production num¬ 
ber. And at night, in place of the Z8‘s soft red lighting emanating from the instrument cen¬ 
ters, it's blue - blue being a traditional ALPINA identifier. (The dials themselves are ALPINA 
too, and have red pointers.)
