Driver Information 




Instrument Cluster 


The instrument cluster in the Z4 has a sporty appearance in line with a roadster. The instru¬ 
ment cluster is very compact. The needle instruments are integrated in 2 housing attach¬ 
ments. The two needle instruments for the speedometer and the tachometer are thus the 
predominant visual features. 

The needle instruments for the fuel gauge and the coolant temperature gauge are integrat¬ 
ed in the tachometer. The speedometer incorporates an LC display, which shows e.g. 
the total mileage (odometer), the trip distance (trip odometer), the time, the on-board com¬ 
puter functions and the SIA service interval indicator. 

Between the large needle instruments are the indicator and warning lamps and the program 
and gear display. The program and gear display is only featured in vehicles with automatic 
transmissions and SMG sequential manual gearboxes. 

The instrument cluster is the central gateway in the bus network.

Instrument-cluster plug connection 

The 26-pin plug connection is located on the 
reverse side of the instrument cluster. 


New system features/modifications 

The main feature of the instrument cluster in the Z4 is its new design: 

• The indicator and warning lamps between the needle instruments. The coolant 
temperature gauge and the fuel gauge are integrated in the tachometer. 

• Additional indicator and warning lamps (e.g. Electric Power Steering EPS) are 
integrated. 

• The automatic gearbox or Sequential Manual Gearbox SMG has a liquid-crystal display 
for indicating the gear. 

• The instrument cluster of the Z4 has a gateway function between the bus systems (as 
in the E46) K bus, PT-CAN bus and diagnosis bus. 

• The lighting of the instrument cluster is controlled by means of the K bus. 

• The instrument cluster has a modified voltage supply with undervoltage detection. 

• The acoustic alarms and test functions have been expanded.

Driver Information 







System Components 


The instrument-cluster system comprises the following components: 

• Needle instruments 

• Indicator and warning lamps 

• LC display 

• Program and gear display for automatic gearbox and SMG Sequential Manual Gearbox 

• Acoustic generator for outputting acoustic alarms 

• Acoustic generator for outputting turn-signal flasher rate 

• Two setting buttons, integrated in instrument cluster 

• Connected components which serve to activate the displays/ indications in the instru¬ 
ment cluster (see system overview/system schematic) 


Display areas 

The instrument cluster is divided 
into the following display areas: 

• Needle instruments 

• Indicator and warning lamps 

• LC display 

• Program and gear display for 
automatic gearbox and SMG 
Sequential Manual Gearbox 



Instrument-cluster lighting 


The speedometer and the tachometer are illuminated by slit light between the dial face and 
the graduated dial. The brightness of the dial-face, needle and display illumination (dim¬ 
ming) is determined by the LSZ light switch center. The lights ON signal is transmitted from 
the LSZ light switch center to the instrument cluster (via the K bus). The dimming signal is 
also transmitted via the K bus. The LSZ evaluates the following input signals to control dim¬ 
ming: 

• Dimmer (knurl in light switch center) 

• Photoelectric cell for ambient brightness (in light switch center) 


Because the dimming signal is sent via the K bus, there is no need for terminal 58g.

Driver Information 




Instrument Cluster Power Supply 

An integrated power supply unit (switching controller) delivers the supply voltage to the 
instrument cluster. The lighting of the instrument cluster is therefore not dependent on the 
vehicle electrical system and no fluctuations in brightness can occur in the event of distur¬ 
bances in the electrical system. 

Undervoltage detection 

The instrument cluster incorporates an undervoltage-detection facility. Undervoltage detec¬ 
tion is performed in the instrument cluster with the aid of a comparator (software-based 
voltage comparison). 

Note: 

Overvoltage in the electrical system is also detected. In the event of a system voltage > 16 
volts, it is possible for: 

• Inputs and outputs to be deactivated 

• Indicator and warning lamps to be deactivated or dimmed for the duration of the over 
voltage 

Coolant temperature gauge 

In the event of coolant overtemperature, a warning sound is issued when the red indicator 
and warning lamp lights up. The signal is delivered by the DME via the PT-CAN bus. 

Fuel gauge 

The indicator lamp is activated when the fuel reserve drops below a threshold coded at the 
plant (standard = 8 liters). 

Indicator Lamps 

There are a total of 24 indicator and warning lamps in the instrument cluster of the new Z4. 
The following two lamps are new additions to the established lamps: 

• Indicator lamp for EPS: The Electric Power Steering system is used in the new Z4 for 
the first time. 

• Indicator lamp for lamp monitoring: This lamp indicates lamp failure in the headlights, 
rear lights and brake lights and is activated by the light switch center. 

The instrument cluster receives input signals through the following channels: 

• Via the K bus 

• Via the PT-CAN bus 

• Directly from the sensors

Driver Information 
























Predrive Check 


The Predrive Check is a test of important indicator and warning lamps. In the Predrive 
Check, these indicator and warning lamps are activated for 2 seconds with terminal 15 ON. 
All the indicator and warning lamps are deactivated at the end of the Predrive Check. 

LC Display 

The LC display is located between the speedometer and the tachometer. With terminal 15 
OFF, run-on operation is possible provided the SMG is still transmitting CAN telegrams. 

The LC display is integrated in the speedometer. It has been adapted to the E85 instrument 
cluster and operates in the same way as that of the E46.

Program and Gear Display 

In cars fitted with an automatic gearbox (5HP19) or an SMG Sequential Manual Gearbox, 
the program and gear display is featured in a separate LC display. 



Acoustic generators 

Depending on the incident, the acoustic alarms 
are output once or intermittently. 

The following acoustic alarms are new: 

• Coolant overtemperature 

• Fuel-reserve threshold 


1. Acoustic Relay 

2. Internal Speaker

Driver Information 









Seat Belt Reminder 


The seat-belt reminder for USA is activated with terminal 15 ON if the seat-belt contact is 
not closed. The acoustic alarm is intermittent and lasts for max. 6 seconds. After this time 
has elapsed, only the indicator and warning lamp remains lit. 

Setting Buttons 



2 setting buttons are 
located between the 2 
large needle instruments. 

1. S/R for Set/Reset 

2. Clock 


The left button (S/R for Set/Reset) is used to reset the trip odometer reading, to call up the 
test functions and to call up the reset menu for the service interval indicator. 

The right button (clock symbol) is used to set the time and to switch the service interval 
indicator (remaining distance/service date or vice versa). (To set clock, press and hold but¬ 
ton #2 until hour flashes, then tap to change hour, press and hold again until minutes 
appear.) 

System functions 

Bus network 

The instrument cluster is the central gateway (interface) for the bus network: 

The bus systems PT-CAN bus, K bus and diagnosis bus and the byteflight are intercon¬ 
nected in the instrument cluster. 

The byteflight is connected via the Safety and Information Module SIM (= gateway) to the 
K bus.

Instrument cluster as gateway 



The instrument cluster is the interface between K bus, PT-CAN bus and diagnosis bus. The 
instrument cluster communicates with other control units in the car via the K bus (single¬ 
core) or the PT-CAN bus (two-core). 


On-board computer 


The on-board computer functions are the same as those of the E46. A new feature in the 
E85 is the possibility of combining time and outside temperature in the display depending 
on the equipment specification. 

On-board computer display in navigation-system on-board monitor 

In cars equipped with the High navigation system, the on-board computer functions are 
displayed in the pop-up on-board monitor (Central Information Display CID). 

The "Distance to junction" navigation data is displayed in parallel in the instrument cluster. 

Settings (e.g. units or reset) which are made at the navigation system controls using the 
rotary pushbutton are sent by bus telegram to the instrument cluster. 

The date can be set at the navigation-system controls. The date is administered in the 
instrument cluster and shown in the onboard monitor.

Driver Information 









Redundant data storage (RDA) 

The kilometer reading/mileage and the data of the SIA service interval indicator are stored 
redundantly in the following control units: instrument cluster, LSZ light switch center and 
EWS electronic immobilizer.The above-mentioned data are thus retained when the control 
units are replaced. 

Notes for Service 


Test functions 


The test functions are used by service mechanics to check the coding. They also provide 
help in troubleshooting without the diagnostic tester. 

The test functions are only shown in the instrument-cluster LC display. 

The test functions are activated by pressing the left setting button in the instrument cluster 
(S/R, 5 seconds) with terminal R or terminal 15 ON. In addition, the test functions can still 
be called up by pressing the left setting button (S/R for Set/Reset) in the instrument cluster 
with simultaneous activation of terminal R. 

The test functions are shown in the odometer and trip-odometer display areas in the top 
line of the display. 

The display of the on-board computer function is retained in the bottom display line. 



E85 Test Functions

Visual system test 

In the visual system test, all the indica¬ 
tor lamps and lights - with the excep¬ 
tion of the ABS warning lamp - are acti¬ 
vated briefly. The needle instruments 
are moved from the lower to upper stop 
and back again. 


Diagnosis 

Component replacement and trial replacement There are three possible combinations for 
replacing the instrument cluster/light switch center: 

• Instrument cluster faulty, light switch center OK 

• Light switch center faulty, instrument cluster OK 

• Light switch center and instrument cluster must be replaced 

Simultaneous replacement of the light switch center and the instrument cluster must be 
avoided. The odometer reading will be lost. In principle it is also possible to carry out a trial 
replacement of the instrument cluster/light switch center. 

Car & key memory 

There are different car-memory functions for the E85 with regard to the display of units in 
the instrument cluster.
