Cooling Module 

The E85 cooling system uses a 
cooling module similar to the E46. 

On the E85, the cooling module is 
separated by a partition (radiator 
core support) from the engine. 

1. Partition (structural/core support) 

2. Cooling module 


The cooling module contains the following cool¬ 
ing system components: 

1. Cooling radiator 

2. Coolant expansion/reservoir tank 

3. Air conditioning condenser 

4. Electric fan (suction or puller type) 

• Automatic transmission fluid radiator (only if equipped) 

Coolant Expansion Tank 

When filling the coolant expansion tank, the engine can be almost completely filled with 
coolant and self bled. The heater core return flows directly into the coolant expansion tank. 

This prevents air pockets in the heating system and ensures trouble-free bleeding of the 
cooling system.

Principle of Operation 
Cooling System Function 

The concept of the cooling system in the E85 M54 ensures high coolant temperature in the 
crankcase which reduces the friction between cylinder walls and pistons, reducing fuel con¬ 
sumption. The increase of coolant temperature in the crankcase is achieved by flowing the 
coolant mainly through the cylinder head. 

A low coolant temperature in the cylinder head has a positive effect on the entire torque 
characteristics of the engine: Low temperatures in the cylinder head lead to a high engine 
charge (air and fuel) and a rise in the anti-knock limit. In addition, a low coolant tempera¬ 
ture in the cylinder head improves the durability of the components. This concept is referred 
to as the partial engine flow cooling concept (MTK). 

The coolant is fed by the water pump via a cast-on feed duct to the rear end of the cylin¬ 
der head and from there towards the front to the coolant outlet (radiator outlet if engine 
warmed up). The water jacket in the crankcase is connected to the flow in the cylinder head 
via bore holes in the crankcase and through the cylinder head gasket. This means that only 
a part volume of the coolant flows through the crankcase. 

The MTK principle leads to a significant temperature increase in the crankcase with virtual¬ 
ly unchanged temperature in the cylinder head. 


Map-controlled Thermostat 

The effect of the MTK cooling concept is additionally supported in the M54 by control of 
the coolant temperature using the map thermostat. With low load, the map thermostat sets 
a high coolant temperature that has a favorable effect on fuel consumption. At full load 
and/or high engine speed, the coolant temperature is lowered to protect the components.

Exhaust System 


The E85 exhaust system is designed for the sporting engine sound of a roadster. The 
exhaust systems for the M54B25 and M54B30 engines are identical. The exhaust system 
consists of the following components: 

• Exhaust manifold (with catalytic converter, cylinders 1 -3) 

• Exhaust manifold (with catalytic converter, cylinders 4-6) 

• Front silencer 

• Center silencer 

• Rear silencer (with tailpipes). 

Each exhaust manifold forms a component together with the catalytic converter housing. 

In the catalytic converter housing, a metal 
monolith pre-catalytic converter and a 
metal monolith main catalytic converter 
are arranged in sequence. 

1. Oxygen sensors (primary oxygen sensors, 

Bosch LSH-25) 

2. Lambda sensors (secondary oxygen sensors, 

Bosch LSH-25) 

3. Catalytic converter housing (cylinders 1-3) 

4. Catalytic converter housing (cylinders 4-6) 



The front silencer has a volume of 3.4 litres. The center silencer has a volume of 1.5 litres. 
The rear silencer has a volume of 22.7 litres. The two oval tailpipes and the rear silencer 
form one component. In order to absorb oscillations and noises, the rear silencer is fitted 
with a rubber damper.

2. Center silencer 

3. Rear silencers

Secondary Air System 


For use in the E85, the M54 secondary air pump has a high output supply rate (45 kg/hour). 


1. Air filter 

2. Secondary air pump (SLP) 

3. Secondary air valve (SLV) 



The electrically driven secondary air pump is mounted to the body in the engine compart¬ 
ment (in the area of the right-hand strut tower). To draw in secondary air, the SLP has an 
integrated air filter element. The air filter element is maintenance-free during the service life 
of the vehicle. 

After the engine is started, the ECM activates the secondary air pump relay to provide 
power to the secondary air pump. It remains on until the engine has taken in a certain 
amount of air. The ON period may be a maximum of 90 seconds and depends on the fol¬ 
lowing engine operating conditions: 

• Coolant temperature (from -10 °C to approximately 60 °C) 

• Air mass 

• Engine speed 

The secondary air valve is mounted to the side of the cylinder head. The SLV is opened by 
the pressure generated by the secondary air pump. The secondary air is led through a pipe 
to the secondary air ducts. The SLV closes as soon as the secondary air pump switches 
off, preventing emission “back flow” to the secondary air pump.

Fresh Air System 


The fresh air system of the E85 is specifically configured for the M54 engine and on the 
M54B30 engine, there is an integrated Motor Sound System (MSS). 


1. Connection of MSS at front bulkhead 

2. Motor Sound System (MSS) 

3. Suction jet pump, brake power assistance 

4. Electronic throttle valve (EDK) 

5. Air-cleaner housing 

6. Intake air guidance 



Motor Sound System (MSS) 

The Motor Sound System is a membrane system for modulating and transmitting the intake 
system pressure pulses to the passenger compartment. This generates a sporting sound 
that is typical of a roadster. 

In this market segment, BMW is the first manufacturer to deliberately transmit pressure 
pulses from the intake system to generate sound in the passenger compartment. The MSS 

is only installed on the M54B30 engine. 


1. Connection of MSS at front bulkhead 

2. Housing 

3. Upper support 

4. Lower mounting 

5. Connection to the intake system

Structure of the Engine Sound System (MSS) 



45-03-05 


1. Housing with support 

5. Rotating element 

2. Membrane 

6. Housing 

3. Thrust piece 

7. Sound channel 

4. Tensioning spring 

8. Sealing sleeve 
- in bulkhead 


The sound generator is connected by a membrane (2) to the column of air in the intake 
manifold. The pressure pulse is transmitted into the passenger compartment via this mem¬ 
brane, which also ensures a “sealed” intake system. 

A clamping mechanism ensures a constant preload on the membrane for even acoustics, 
balancing out temperature and material aging influences on the membrane. The tensioning 
spring (4) generates an axial motion of the plunger (3) by turning the rotating element (5). 
The plunger continuously tensions the membrane. 

Note: There are foam inserts in the sound channel (7). These must not be removed during 
repairs, because the noise generated in the vehicle interior will increases to an unaccept¬ 
able level.

Suction Jet Pump 


The suction jet pump ensures the necessary vacuum in the brake booster so that the brak¬ 
ing force is retained for a certain period even after the intake system vacuum depletes. Two 
non-return valves are integrated in the suction jet pump for brake power assistance. 


1. Connection to intake boot 

2. Suction jet pump 

3. Connection to intake manifold 

4. Venturi pipe 

5. Connection to brake booster 



45-03-05 


The suction jet pump works according to the Venturi principle: generation of a pressure dif¬ 
ference by increasing the flow speed. This means that the suction jet pump creates a high¬ 
er vacuum for the brake booster than that already present in the intake system. 


Ancillary Components and Belt Drive 

The ancillary components and the belt drive of the M54 engine are slightly modified for the 
E85. The viscous fan and power steering pump are eliminated. Depending on the vehicle 
equipment, alternators with 90 A or 120 A are used in the E85. 


1. Belt pulley, crankshaft 

2. Ribbed V-belt (main drive) 

3. Coolant pump 

4. Tensioning roller (main drive) 

5. Deflection pulley 

6. Alternator 

7. Deflection pulley 

8. Ribbed V-belt (air conditioner drive) 

9. Air conditioning compressor 

10. Tensioning roller (air conditioner drive)
