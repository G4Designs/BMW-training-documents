1. Introduction 


For customers with especially high performance demands, BMW M GmbH now offers the extreme 
sports car successor based on the BMW M4 Coupe, the BMW M4 GTS. Like its predecessor, the E92 
BMW M3 GTS, the BMW M4 GTS is also suitable for driving at club sport events. The BMW M4 GTS 
is produced by the BMW M GmbH manufacturing facility and is offered as a perfectly matched and 
individually produced package. The modifications for club sport use include the drive, chassis and 
suspension technology, vehicle electrical system as well as exterior and interior body equipment. 

The market introduction of the BMW M4 GTS will take place in March 2016. 

With its exclusive offering for motor sports enthusiasts, BMW M GmbH continues a tradition that was 
already established with the earlier generations of the BMW M3. The outstanding sporty potential of 
the BMW M4 Coupe has been exploited and consistently further developed once more. Customers 
benefit from the extensive know-how of the company in the field of development and production of 
racing vehicles. Thank to targeted modifications to improve performance and safety, the BMW M4 
GTS is ready for driving on the race track in club sport competition and at the same time offers the 
possibility of vehicle type approval for street use. The driver can thus make his way to the race track 
in his own sports vehicle or can also use the car to drive to work. 

This BMW Sports Coupe based on the F82 is intended for the ECE, US and Asian markets. Production 
of left and right-hand drive vehicles is planned. The first vehicle will be built at the start of 2016 and 
production will end after approx. 700 units worldwide are produced. The vehicles will be built on the 
production installations on the basis of the F82 and then finished and fine-tuned by a supplier (EDAG 
Engineering GmbH). 



F82, BMW M4 GTS 


Consistently purist design, adjustable aerodynamic elements, increased performance through 
water injection for the turbocharged six-cylinder high-rewing in-line engine, as well as chassis and 
suspension technology designed to meet the demands of driving on the race track mean that the 
BMW M4 GTS occupies a leading position among high-performance vehicles designed for club sport 
events. 

The visual differentiation in comparison with the BMW M4 Coupe includes exterior components 
finished in matt black such as the BMW kidney grille and roof strips as well as the side gill elements 
in dark-anodized chrome on the BMW M4 GTS (BMW M4 Coupe in chrome). 

Only the differences of the F82 M4 GTS in comparison with the F82 M4 Coupe will be described here.

The bodyshell largely corresponds to the series body of the F82 M4 Coupe. Special mounting points 
are required to fit the GTS-specific equipment. These include: 

• Mounting for the roll bar front right and left 

• Mounting for the roll bar at rear right and left 

• Heel panels for mounting the rear bench cover at front 

The GTS-specific mounts are welded onto the bodyshell.

3.2.1. Front view 

The bumper panel in the M-specific design corresponds to the bumper panel of the F82 BMW M4 
Coupe. In order to optimize the air flow and downforce adaptation corresponding to demands, the 
F82 M4 GTS is equipped with a motor sports-oriented front splitter to increase the downforce in the 
front area of the vehicle. The front splitter is weight-optimized and is made of carbon-fiber-reinforced 
plastic. It is bolted together with the bumper panel in exposed carbon look and is always provided with 
an "Acid Orange" outer edge regardless of the chosen vehicle exterior color. 

The frame and the double-bridge longitudinal bars of the BMW M kidney grille are finished in high- 
gloss black as standard for the F82 M4 GTS and are provided with the M4 model designation.

Hood 

The hood is made of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic on the F82 M4 GTS. 



F82 GTS, CFRP hood 

This hood structure makes it possible to achieve strength properties that are normally only possible 
with a steel design. However, the hood of the F82 M4 GTS is made of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic 
and weighs 25% less than the hood made of aluminium on the F82 M4. The CFRP hood thus also 
contributes to the lightweight construction concept of the new F82 M4 GTS. 

The hood also performs engine cooling tasks with its F82 M4 GTS-specific openings and its 
aerodynamic design additionally supports the downforce at the front end.

In order to optimize the air flow and permit downforce, the F82 M4 GTS is equipped with motor 
sports-oriented rear wing spoiler as well as a diffuser at the rear. These contribute to the aerodynamic 
properties of the vehicle to match the specific track profile and other conditions when it is used on the 
race track.

Rear spoiler winglets US design 

The rear spoiler system is based on the spoiler used on the E90 BMW 320si used in the World Touring 
Car Championship WTCC. 



F82 GTS, rear spoiler winglets US version 


A_ 

Note: In the US there is a specification for the minimum viewable angle for the center mounted 
brake light, so the positioning of the rear spoiler winglets had to be repositioned so the 
visibility of the brake light was not impaired. Therefore, the winglets on all US spec vehicles 
will be the reverse of the ECE vehicles. This has no functional difference for the aerodynamics 
of the rear spoiler.

F82 GTS, rear spoiler winglets ECE version, shown in race position 2 


The rear spoiler of the F82 M4 GTS is made of Carbon-Fiber-Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) and is 
supported by aluminium brackets. The trunk is made of Sheet Molded Compound (SMC) and was 
modified for the rear spoiler. The rear spoiler can be fixed in 3 different positions: 

• Street setting drilled hole 1 

• 2 different race track settings, drilled hole 2 & 3 


20 






F82 GTS Complete Vehicle 

3. Body 



Street setting on rear spoiler 


In general, if the front spoiler is extended from the street position, the inclination angle of the rear 
spoiler should also be raised. Otherwise, a safe vehicle balance is not guaranteed at higher speeds. 


The proper settings for the rear spoiler during street use as well as the recommendations for motor 
sports settings and tightening torques are described in the Supplementary Owner's Handbook of the 
F82 M4 GTS. 


A 

Adjustments to the rear spoiler must be performed only when the trunk is closed. When undoing the 
screws, it must be ensured that the rear spoiler does not tip down. 


Rear lights in organic LED technology (OLED) 

The rear lights of the F82 M4 GTS are called BMW Organic Light. Organic light-emitting diodes, so- 
called OLEDs, are used. The OLEDs are composed of thin films of organic molecules that create light 
with the application of electricity. 


21 







F82 GTS Complete Vehicle 

3. Body 



F82 GTS, OLED rear light 

These LEDs are innovative and sustainable light sources which generate light from organic material 
and also highly energy efficient. In contrast to standard LEDs, OLEDs provide homogeneous light over 
the full area. Individual activation of OLED segments makes it possible to create a completely new light 
graphic designs. On the BMW M4 GTS, OLED technology is used both for the tail lights and for the 
turn indicators. 

3.2.4. Exterior colors 

The F82 M4 GTS is offered exclusively in the exterior color “Frozen Grey metallic”. 

The customer can additionally order three alternative colors: 

• Alpine White 

• Black Sapphire metallic 

• Mineral Grey metallic 

With all exterior colors, certain components are also partially highlighted in “Acid Orange” 

(e.g. wheels, splitter, roll bar).

3.3. Interior 


3.3.1. Driving area and steering wheel 

The vehicle curb weight of the F82 M4 GTS is around 3,610 pounds. For this reason, lightweight 
design was consistently used for many components in the interior. Unnecessary parts such as the rear 
bench seat was removed and replaced by lightweight covers. The individual measures are described in 
the chapter "Interior". 

M driving area 



F82 GTS, driving area 


The F82 M4 GTS has a center console in lightweight construction with Alcantara covering and

M leather steering wheel 

The M steering wheel in Alcantara with multifunction capability is designed with a magnesium frame 
and is based on the steering wheel of the F82 BMW M4 Coupe. Above the thumb rests are the M 
gearshift paddles with M gearshift logic: downshift on left, upshift on right. A marking was provided 
at the top center to highlight the 12 o'clock position of the steering wheel. This makes it easier to 
recognize the center position of the steering wheel when performing rapid steering wheel movements. 

Two MDrive buttons Ml and M2 are integrated in the left multifunction button pad on the F82 BMW

Seat bench 

A rear seat bench and the corresponding seat belts were removed. Since the F82 M4 GTS is designed 
as a club sport vehicle, the rear bench is not needed. The following components are used instead: 

• a rear partition wall is made of Glass-Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) with Alcantara covering 

• the rear seat bench cover is made of GFRP with Alcantara covering 

• a special floor cover in the rear footwell

Coupe. 

3.3.4. Rear parcel shelf 

The storage shelf used in the F82 M4 GTS is the Top HiFi system version from the F82 BMW M4 
Coupe. This is necessary because the door speakers and speakers in the rear side trim panels are not 
installed due to the new door trim panels and side trim panels. 

3.3.5. Sound insulation 

For weight reasons, the sound insulation for the vehicle interior in the F82 M4 GTS has been reduced 
to the minimum.

4.1. S55B30T0 engine 

The familiar S55B30T0 engine from the F82 BMW M4 Coupe is used. By using water injection, it 
was possible to increase the power to 493 HP and the torque to 600 Nm/443 Ib-ft. It was possible to 
adopt the S55 engine-specific technology, such as the crankcase in closed-deck design, LDS-coated 
cylinder walls, Valvetronic and twin turbocharging based on the mono-scroll concept with electric 
wastegate control, from the S55B30T0 engine. 



F82 GTS, engine S55B30T0 


The technical measures are the use of water injection to increase power as well as ensuring the oil 
supply when the vehicle is subjected to longitudinal and lateral acceleration forces of 1.4 g. A titanium 
rear silencer in lightweight construction is used. Like on the F82 BMW M4 Coupe, this is equipped 
with electric exhaust flaps. The M-typical twin exhaust tailpipes are made of titanium. 

4.1.1. Engine mechanics 

In comparison with the S55 engine in the F82 BMW M4 Coupe, the S55 engine in the F82 M4 GTS 
features a modified bedplate. The reinforced bedplate is taken from the competition package of the 
S55 engine. The bedplate from the competition package has a higher rigidity in order to meet the 
demands of the higher torque curve of the S55 competition engine.

4.1.2. Oil supply 

The S55 engine of the F82 M4 GTS is equipped with a longer oil-level sensor. This is necessary since 
the oil quantity of the S55 engine in the F82 M4 GTS was increased compared with the S55 standard 
engine. The oil quantity in the oil sump in the S55 engine of the F82 M4 GTS is 6.5 liters compared 
with 6.0 liters in the S55 engine for the F82 BMW M4 Coupe. It was necessary to increase the oil 
quantity in order to maintain the oil supply with further increased g forces of up to 1.4 g produced by 
longitudinal and transverse acceleration in permanent race track operation. Since the oil-level sensor 
used in the S55 engine for the F82 M4 GTS is restricted by the available installation space, 
an additional shim is fitted between the oil-level sensor and oil sump. 

4.1.3. Service information 

Like on the F80/F82 and F83, the engine oil is currently replaced at 2,000 km /1200 miles (running- 
in check). After this, the running-in check must be reset with the BMW workshop system Integrated 
Service Technical Application, ISTA.

4.1.4. Water injection 

Background 

In the middle of the 1930’s and at the start of the 1940’s in the last century, various attempts were 
already being made in the field of aeronautics to achieve a simple and effective increase in the 
performance of combustion engines through turbocharging which could be implemented quickly on 
demand when requested by the pilot. It was possible to effectively meet this requirement by means of 
water injection. Since water as a medium also contains bound oxygen and helps cool the combustion 
chamber, the use of water permits the charge to be increased by the charging pressure in the cylinder 
so that more power can be generated in a combustion engine. The targeted injection of water, which 
can also be mixed with alcohol, made it possible to achieve a short-term increase in the output power 
of the combustion engines by over 40% from a certain charging pressure. This was necessary in 
particular when the aircraft was climbing or flying at a high altitude where there was already low air 
pressure. The targeted injection of water or water mixture into the combustion engine then made it 
possible for the pilot to achieve a short-term increase in power. 

After this, water injection was used only very rarely for many decades, until it was again discovered in 
the 1980’s of the last century as a way of achieving a short-term increase in power in Formula 1 cars. 
This method is still used today in motor sports.

Function 

The distilled water (referred to as "water" below) is carried in a separate supply tank in the vehicle. 

At a certain operating point (e.g. charging pressure, load, engine speed), the water is drawn in from 
the supply tank by a pump. The drawn in water is delivered via a line to one or more water injectors. 
The water injectors, which can be installed in the intake plenum for the intake air, inject finely atomized 
water so that it can be supplied via the intake channels to the combustion chamber. 

With water injection, the engineers exploit the physical property of water whereby it takes the energy 
required for evaporation from the surrounding area. When the water is injected into the intake plenum 
as a fine spray mist, its evaporation results in significant cooling of the intake air by approx. 25 °C / 77 
°F. As a result, the final compression temperature in the combustion chamber and the knock tendency 
is reduced. This means that the turbo engine can be operated with a higher charging pressure and 
earlier ignition point. 

Advantages 

• Efficiency: Cooling by means of water injection makes it possible to achieve a reduction in 
combustion temperature in high load ranges. This permits a homogeneous fuel-air mixture 
and increased efficiency at full load. 

• Emission behavior: Lower combustion temperatures reduce the production of pollutants, 
particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx). 

• Reduced knock tendency: The risk of uncontrolled combustion (so-called knocking) 
is reduced by the reduction in combustion temperature. 

• Higher compression: A lower knock tendency makes it possible to increase the 
compression. This results in optimized efficiency also in the upper partial load range. 

• Dynamic: An earlier ignition point and higher charging pressure increase the engine power 
and torque by up to ten percent. An additional increase in power is achieved by the higher 
oxygen content in cool intake air. 

• Fuel compatibility: Optimized power output even when using fuel with a lower octane 
number (RON 95). Turbo engines with direct water injection can be used worldwide. 

• Thermal load: The cooling effect of water injection reduces temperature influences on the 
pistons, valves, catalytic converter and turbocharger.

Integration 

On the F82 M4 GTS, the water supply is ensured by means of a 5-liter /1.3 gallon water tank. 

The water tank with cover is located together with the water pump and valve block in a carrier under 
a cover in the luggage compartment floor at the rear of the vehicle.

Bulkheads are installed in the water tank. These bulkheads prevent strong water movements in the 
water tank under extreme driving conditions. In addition, a non-return valve prevents the water from 
flowing away from the water pump extraction point in the water tank. This allows the water supply 
to be guaranteed down to a minimum quantity of 300 ml in the water tank. If the temperature should 
fall below freezing, additional expansion chambers in the upper part of the water tank enable volume 
compensation of the water upon freezing. This prevents the water tank from being damaged by the 
water freezing when the tank is full.

A filling level indicator and temperature sensor monitors the water level and water temperature in the 
water tank. If the water in the water tank falls below the minimum fill quantity of < 1.0 liter / 0.2 gallons, 
the CC message “Water injection: Tank reservoir level” is displayed to the driver.

Water injection is no longer available if the water level in the storage tank drops below the minimum 
level of 300 ml /10 ounces. The engine power will then be lowered to the standard power of the S55 
engine along with a check control message in the cluster. 

The water is supplied from the pump to the water injectors by a line that is routed in the underbody of 
the F82 M4 GTS. Three water injectors are installed in the intake air plenum. These injectors atomize 
the water in the intake air plenum that is mixed with air that enters the combustion chamber, there is 
one injector for every 2 cylinders.

A pump generates the required pressure. A valve block performs water distribution to the water 
injectors and back to the water tank. A pressure sensor in the feed line in the valve block monitors

The valve block for water injection contains two 3/2-way valves which control the water flow to the 
water injectors and back to the water tank. The two valves are required since the running direction of 
the water pump cannot be reversed. The flow direction of the water is therefore controlled by means of 
the two 3/2-way valves. 

The water pump, shutoff valve and 3/2-way valves are activated via two electric relays, which are 
correspondingly activated by the DME. 

The shutoff valve ensures that: 

• the water tank is separated from the system, so that no water 
can run back into the system after draining. 

• the pressure in the system can be maintained.

In rest state, when water injection is not active, the relays for controlling the pump, shutoff valve and 
3/2-way valves are not activated by the DME and are de-energized. 


Prerequisites 

The following prerequisites must be met so that water injection can be activated: 

• The engine must be running. 

• The engine must be at operating temperature. 

• The ambient temperature must be > 5°C / 41 °F. 

• The water tank must be filled with "distilled water". 

• The fill quantity of the water tank must be > 300 ml /10 oz. 


System filling and pressure maintenance 

If the above prerequisites are met, the system is filled after the engine is started until a pressure of 
10 bar is reached. When requested by the DME, the relay for the water pump and shutoff valve is 
energized by the DME. The water pump is switched on and the shutoff valve is opened. The water 
pump then draws in water from the water tank and pumps it at a pressure of 10 bar to the water 
injectors via the 3/2-way valves and the pressure sensor. When a pressure of 10 bar has been reached, 
the DME switches off the water pump and closes the shutoff valve. The shutoff valve maintains the 
pressure of 10 bar in the system.

System active 

If the engine is operated in a load range (full load) and engine speed range (> 5000 rpm) that justifies 
water injection, the DME requests this. When requested by the DME, the relay for the water pump and 
shutoff valve is energized by the DME. The water pump is switched on and the shutoff valve is opened. 
The water pump then draws in water from the water tank and pumps it with a pressure of 10 bar via 
the 3/2-way valves and the pressure sensor to the injectors, which are activated and are opened by the 
DME. All three water injectors are operated at a pressure of 10 bar. 

The quantity of the water to be injected is controlled by the DME on the basis of a stored characteristic 
map, which provides the DME information on the load request, engine speed and charging pressure 
currently present. 

The pressure sensor permanently monitors the water pressure in the lines to the water injectors.

If water injection is no longer required at the request of the DME, the water pump is switched off, 
along with the shutoff valve and water injectors by the relay. 

The shutoff valve holds the water in the water pump and in the valve block up to the closed water 
injectors. This means that it is not necessary to fill the entire system again when water injection is 
activated once more. 

System draining 

The system is drained at the request of the DME if the engine is switched off or if the ambient 
temperature falls below 5 °C / 41 °F. 

When requested by the DME, the relay for the water pump and shutoff valve is energized. Since the 
running direction of the water pump cannot be reversed, the relay for the two 3/2-way valves and the 
water injectors is also energized at the same time.

As a result of the changed position of the two 3/2-way valves, the water is drawn out of the system and 
delivered back to the water storage tank with the same direction of rotation of the water pump.

When the engine is switched off and the water injection system is drained, operating noises occur 
which may be heard by the customer. These operating noises cannot be avoided due to the operating 
principle of the system. 


Component protection 

A pressure limiting valve limits the water pressure in the system to protect all components in the event 
of a malfunction (e.g. obstruction) in the valve block or in the downstream components such as lines 
and water injectors.

Water consumption 

The water consumption depends greatly on the vehicle operating conditions and varies 
correspondingly. As a rule of thumb, a consumption of 0.6 / - 1 liter per 100 km or 0.15 gallons - 0.26 
gallons per 62 miles can be expected on the race track. In the case of dynamic driving (engine speed 
> 5000 rpm and high load) in everyday use, it will probably be necessary to top up with water at only 
every 5th refuelling operation. 


Notes 

When filling the water injection system, only commercially available distilled water (demineralized - 
decalcified) must be used for the F82 M4 GTS. Other fluids or mixtures with alcohol is not approved by 
BMW. 


The 10 pm fine filter in the valve block can be removed and installed using the hexagon screw. The fine 
filter should be replaced at every 2nd oil service/20,000 miles.

4.3. Fuel supply 

The suction strainer on the electric fuel pump was optimized for the F82 M4 GTS. This was necessary 
to guarantee reliable fuel supply even under conditions with high lateral and longitudinal acceleration 
forces. The other fuel supply components of the S55 engine in the F82 M4 GTS are common parts 
with the production vehicles. 


4.4. Exhaust system 

A separate exhaust system is used in the F82 M4 GTS after the catalytic converter near the S55 
engine. The center silencer installed in the F82 BMW M4 Coupe is not installed on the F82 M4 GTS. 

The exhaust system was designed for minimum exhaust gas pressure. Thanks to this dethrottling of 
the exhaust system, it was possible to further optimize gas exchange efficiency. The exhaust system 
was also optimized in terms of lightweight construction. As a result, it was possible to reduce the 
weight of the system by 20% compared with the exhaust system in the F82 BMW M4 Coupe.

The rear silencer and the M-typical exhaust tailpipes are made of weight-optimized titanium (system 
supplier Eberspacher). In addition, the exhaust tailpipes have a purist titanium design and are 
embossed with the "M" designation. 

The electrical exhaust flaps are activated directly by the DME by a pulse-width modulated signal.

The exhaust flap can be opened by a pulse-width modulated signal of 10 % and closed with 90 % 
pulse width modulation. The end positions are the mechanical limit positions of the exhaust flap, 
intermediate settings are not intended. The exhaust flap can be moved to the factory position for the 
installation by a pulse-width modulated signal (PWM) of 50 %. In order to ensure that the desired 
position is held even if the electric exhaust flap controller is not actuated for a long period, current is 
supplied again every 320 s +/-10%. This acts in the direction of the limit position (duration of current 
supply: 50 ms +/- 5 ms). 

Functional input variables for the calculation of the exhaust flap setting are: 

• Vehicle speed 

• Accelerator pedal angle 

• Position of driving experience switch 

• Engine temperature 

• Gear mode 

There is a always a flow through the two tailpipe pairs by the bypass pipe (1) regardless of the flap 
position. Therefore, no varying blackening of the two tailpipe pairs occurs, which is typical of vehicles 
with exhaust flaps. In addition, the exhaust flaps in the tailpipe pairs are not visible through the exhaust 
tailpipes. 


4.5. M DCT Drivelogic 

For power transmission, the F82 M4 GTS uses the M double-clutch transmission M DCT Drivelogic 
also optionally available for the F82 BMW M4 Coupe without any design modifications. The shift 
characteristic of the 7-speed M DCT Drivelogic was made even more suitable for motor sports driving 
and matched specifically to the F82 M4 GTS.

The number of driving programs is the same as for the F82 BMW M4 Coupe. 

After each change between Sequential mode and Drive mode the last selected driving program 
is active. 

After each engine start driving program 1 is active in Drive mode. 

Drive mode 

Three driving programs are available for selection: 

1: Efficient drive 
2: Dynamic drive 
3: Sport drive

Sequential mode 

Three driving programs are also available here for selection: 

1: Comfortable gear shifts 
2: Sporty, fast gear shifts 

3: Maximum shift speed and the requirement for the activation of the launch control 

4.5.2. Launch Control 

Launch Control enables optimal acceleration when driving off on a smooth roadway. 


A 


Launch Control should generally not be used during the first 5,000 km / 3100 miles when running 
in the vehicle (also see section Driving tips in the Owner's Handbook). 

The 2,000 km /1200 miles running-in check must have been completed and reset/confirmed with 
the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA) (do not reset via the instrument cluster service 
function, as otherwise the launch control is not enabled). 

Premature wear occurs as a result of the high load on the vehicle components when using Launch 
Control. 

Pre-configuring 


Sequence 

Precondition/Action 

1 . 

The vehicle must be stationary with the engine running at idle speed and 
at operating temperature (approx. 10 km / 6 mile warm-up drive). 

2. 

Deactivate Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). 

3. 

The Sequential mode and the third Drivelogic driving program are selected. 

4. 

Slightly press and hold the brake pedal with your left foot. 

5. 

Fully depress the accelerator pedal and hold in position. 

6. 

A flag symbol appears in the M instrument cluster (if not, check instructions 
and steps 1 - 5). 

7. 

An engine speed for pulling away of approx. 3,000 rpm is set. This can be 
modified up or down by a maximum 500 rpm in 100 rpm increments using 
the operating elements of the cruise control. 

8. 

Rapidly release the brake pedal within 3 s. 


55 










F82 GTS Complete Vehicle 

4. Drive 


Effect 


The Launch Control shifts independently up to the maximum speed with the shortest possible 
shifting times and shift points optimized for driving performance as long as the driver keeps 
the accelerator pedal fully depressed and a time limit of 22 seconds is not exceeded for 
acceleration. 

The start flag in the instrument cluster remains active. 


Automatic deactivation 

• The driver releases (even if only temporary) the accelerator pedal from the fully depressed 
position during acceleration or the acceleration phase reaches a duration of 22 seconds. 

Activation of Launch Control is not possible if one of these pre-configuration conditions is not met. 

The start flag goes out with every deactivation and the automatic forced upshift is cancelled. 

A defined distance must be travelled before each new activation of Launch Control. 

Also at excessive transmission oil temperature (e.g. repeat Launch Control or race-like start), activation 
is blocked up until an acceptable temperature threshold is reached. 

4.5.3. Wheelspin start 

A_ _ 

A wheelspin start should generally not be used during the first 5,000 km / 3100 miles when running 
in the vehicle (see also the chapter Driving tips in the Owner's Handbook). 

The 2,000 km /1200 miles running-in check must have been completed and reset/confirmed with 
the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA) (do not reset via the instrument cluster service 
function, as otherwise the wheelspin start function is not enabled). 

Premature wear occurs as a result of the high load on the vehicle components when using the 
wheelspin start function. 


Preheating/Precooling 

Sequence 

Precondition/Action 

1 . 

The vehicle must be stationary with the engine running at idle speed and 
at operating temperature (approx. 10 km / 6 mile warm-up drive). 

2. 

Deactivate Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). 

3. 

Select sequential or automated mode. 

4. 

Fully depress the accelerator pedal and hold in position. 


56 








F82 GTS Complete Vehicle 

4. Drive 


Effect 

• The vehicle accelerates with maximum power and with corresponding wheel slip, 
depending on the surface. 

• In sequential mode, the driver must shift up manually so that he does not drive against the 
speed limiter. 

• In the case of automated upshifts, the M DCT carries out the upshifts independently. 

In addition to the Launch Control and wheelspin start functions, the M DCT also offers additional 
M functions such as Stability Clutch Control (opening the clutch to stabilize the vehicle in the event 
of oversteer) or "Creep on Demand" (from vehicle standstill, the driver activates the "creep mode" 
familiar from automatic transmissions by touching the accelerator pedal). 

4.5.4. Emergency gearbox release 

A 

The emergency gearbox release is not available like on the F80/F82 and F83. For towing of the vehicle, 
please observe the information in the Owner's Handbook for the vehicle. 


4.5.5. Service information 

Transmission oil circuit 

Maximum cleanliness must be ensured if work has to be performed on the oil circuit of the twin-clutch 
gearbox, e.g. after an accident, or if the oil circuit has to be opened due to a repair. This includes: 

• Carefully clean the external oil circuit areas before disassembling the components or opening 
the oil circuit. 

• Immediately close off openings and lines after disassembly without delay using clean, original 
seal plugs. Do not use unsealed components or replacement parts of the oil circuit without 
checking for cleanliness and where possible competent repair. 

• The workbay at which a M DCT is opened must be absolutely clean and protected against dirt 
contamination, also during work interruptions. For example by using appropriate, clean and 
lint-free cloths. Refer to page 81 

Lifetime oil filling 

As for the F80/F82 and the F83 with M DCT Drivelogic, no transmission oil change is currently 
planned at 2,000 km /1,200 mile (running-in check) or at every third engine oil change. 

Repair/Part exchange 

Depending on the type of repair, the data status of the M DCT must be read out beforehand and read 
in again after the component has been replaced (e.g. replacement of mechatronics module). 

Depending on the type of repair (e.g. dual clutch change), the "Neutral" gear selection position must 
be selected before the engine is stopped.

4.6.1. Active M differential 

This electronically/electromechanically controlled rear axle differential lock was developed especially 
for the F10 BMW M5 and is now also used in the F82 M4 GTS. 

The M rear axle differential, size HAG 220 (crown wheel 0 220 mm), is used with a M rear axle 
differential lock. The system designation is “regulated rear axle differential lock" and the control unit 
designation is GHAS (German acronym for Geregelte Hinter Achsgetriebe Sperre). 

The gear ratio of the rear axle differential HAG 220 is 3.462:1. 

This M rear axle differential II can be identified by an aluminium oil sump mounted from below and an 
electric motor which is visible from the outside.

Demand-controlled lock 

The lock is a demand-controlled rear-axle differential lock which is active in the following situations: 

• Acceleration/pullaway. 

• Differential speed at the rear axle for straight-ahead driving under 
load due to various coefficients of friction, left/right. 

• Dynamic cornering. 

• Power oversteer (drifting). 

• Stabilization in coasting/overrun mode. 

Further information on the active M differential is provided in the Technical Training Manual ST 1402 
F80/F82 Complete Vehicle. 

4.6.2. Service information 

• After replacement of the GHAS control unit, it is necessary to perform encoding (activation of 
vehicle-related characteristic curve) and then initial calibration. The fault memory must then be 
deleted. 

• After the replacement of the entire M rear axle differential a calibration must be performed and 
then the fault memory must be deleted. 

• For a replacement of the electric motor, electric motor plus intermediate gear or oil 
temperature sensor, only the fault memory must be deleted. 

The final drive transmission oil is currently replaced at 2,000 km /1,200 mile (running-in check) and at 
every 5th engine oil change. After this, the running-in check must be reset with the BMW workshop 
system Integrated Service Technical Application, ISTA.

5. Chassis and Suspension 

5.1. Front axle and rear axle 

In order to optimally transfer the outstanding engine performance to the road in every driving situation 
and also under extreme conditions, the F82 M4 GTS also features chassis and suspension technology 
that has been developed on the basis of extensive motor sports competence and experience. In terms 
of components and mounting, its chassis and suspension is based on the front and rear axle design of 
the F82 BMW M4 Coupe. 

In deviation from this, an adjustable chassis developed especially for the F82 M4 GTS is installed. The 
adjustable chassis is built by KW Automotive GmbH according to the specifications of M GmbH and 
features dampers where the rebound and compression stages can be adjusted separately from each 
other. The adjustable chassis is bolted together with the body at the front using support rings. 

The damper geometry and damper components on the front and rear axle with springs were adapted 
for use in the F82 M4 GTS and are provided with M-specific tuning. 

The following components were adapted for the F82 M4 GTS: 

• Twin-tube gas-oil pressure shock absorbers at the front and rear with adapted tube geometry. 

• Valve block geometry for adjusting compression and rebound. 

• Specific support bearings at the front in sealed uniball design with fixed camber and castor 
angles. 

• Specific support bearings at rear. 

• Rear bottom shock absorber eye screwed via a sealed uniball bearing. 

• Separate swivel bearing at front to accommodate the shock absorber tube. 

• Specific front anti-roll bar links adapted to shock absorbers. 

• Specific spring geometry of the coil springs at front and rear. 

• Stiffening plate cover made of CFRR

5.2. Adjustable high-performance chassis and suspension 

The chassis and suspension features the following additional adjustment options for an individual 
motor racing setup: 

• Freely adjustable damping technology with 16 exact clicks for rebound adjustment. 

• Freely adjustable damping technology with 6 clicks in the low-speed range for 
compression adjustment. 

• 14 clicks in the high-speed range for compression adjustment. 

• Continuously adjustable lowering of the front and rear axles (threaded spring struts 
on front axle/springs with height adjustment facility and damper on rear axle). 


5.2.1. Stepless lowering 

The factory setting is optimal for both street operation and driving on race tracks (Nordschleife- 
Nurburgring). The factory settings must always be adjusted for operation on public roads. The factory 
setting is marked by so-called C clips. The C clips are installed between the lower edge of the spring 
cup and "race track setup" blocking ring. These clips can be removed in order to lower the chassis. If 
the C clips have been removed and the chassis adjusted away from the factory setting, this no longer 
corresponds to the approval for operation on public roads. A height adjustment automatically results in 
a change in camber and toe. 

The vehicle height can be lowered by 15 mm at the front and 12 mm at the rear. It is necessary to undo 
the spring cup of the dampers to perform adjustment on the rear axle. This is due to the self-locking 
thread and a residual spring stress with the installed damper. If the "race track setup" blocking ring 
is removed, this may result in the vehicle being lowered by an inadmissible amount. The blocking 
ring is secured by means of a break away screw. The "race track setup" blocking ring is adjusted by 
BMW M GmbFI and is provided with a break away screw. As a result, the ring can be removed only with 
difficulty or with force. In order to perform correct adjustment if the blocking ring has been removed, 
a new "race track setup" blocking ring is required. Adjustment must then be performed on a chassis 
and suspension measuring stand (alignment rack) in accordance with the procedure for spring - spring 
strut replacement.

5.2.2. Rebound 

Effects of rebound on drivability 

The rebound setting has a direct influence on the working speed of the piston rod when the 
suspension spring is recovering during the rebound process. In other words, it controls how quickly 
the suspension spring relaxes back to its initial position. The cross-sections of the rebound valves in 
the piston rod are opened further for softer handling and closed for a firmer setup. 


66 



F82 GTS Complete Vehicle 

5. Chassis and Suspension 

• Low rebound forces improve ride comfort at slow driving speeds, but reduce stability and 
steering precision when driving fast, particularly with a corresponding setting. 

• High rebound forces further improve handling at the front axle. This makes handling generally 
safer. However, high rebound forces may also reduce tire grip. Ride comfort is greatly 
restricted with high rebound forces. 

A__ _ 

Under no circumstances must the vehicle be driven with one axle at the maximum hard setting and the 

other axle at the maximum soft setting. 


Rebound adjustment 

The knurled wheel supplied with the F82 M4 GTS is fitted at the top of the front shock absorber to 
adjust the rebound. Rebound adjustment at the rear is performed at the upper end of the piston rod 
using the integrated knurled wheel. Adjustment is performed from closed position (max. hardness) 
towards the soft setting. Closed condition is reached when the knurled wheel is turned clockwise (+) 
in hard direction until it reaches the limit position (number "0" on the knurled wheel). The effective 
adjustment range is 0 -16 clicks in soft direction. The rebound damping is made softer by turning the 
wheel counter-clockwise (- opening). 



F82 GTS, supplied knurled wheel for front rebound adjustment 


A 

The knurled wheel operates a precision-engineered valve. Do not under any circumstances attempt to 
exceed the end of the adjustment range with force. This will damage the adjustment mechanism and 
necessitate exchange of the complete shock absorber. 


The F82 M4 GTS is delivered with a basic rebound setting. If the shock absorbers are reset to the 
basic rebound setting, the values described in the Supplementary Owner's Handbook apply. 


67 







F82 GTS Complete Vehicle 

5. Chassis and Suspension 

5.2.3. Compression stage 

Effects of compression on drivability 

The compression setting allows regulation of the immersion speed of the piston rod via the 
bottom valve (compression valve) of the shock absorber. If the compression valves are opened, the 
compression is reduced and the vehicle dives more quickly in response to steering wheel movements. 
The compression is increased if the compression valves are closed. The piston rods then dive more 
slowly and the vehicle becomes more stable. The compression setting thus affects the vertical force 
excitation of the vehicle. 

The compression setting has a decisive influence on the handling and drivability of the vehicle. 

The basic principle applies: 

• A harder compression setting on the front axle makes the vehicle steering more precise 
and aggressive. A soft compression setting favours more good-natured drivability. 

• A harder compression setting on the rear axle makes the vehicle more stable in the event 
of changes in direction and also counteracts an oversteering tendency. In contrast, a soft 
compression setting allows the rear end to self-steer more. 

• Excessive compression results in uncomfortable rolling behavior and reduces grip. 

However, due to the digressive properties of the pressure valve, a hard setting does not influence 
the compression behavior when driving quickly over shoulders or ground waves. 

A 

Under no circumstances must the vehicle be driven with one axle at the maximum hard setting 
in combination with the other axle at the maximum soft setting. 


Low-speed/high-speed compression stage 

The low-speed range of the compression stage influences the damping strength during compression 
at low piston rod speeds (max. 0.2 m/s). The high-speed compression range applies to all faster 
speeds of the damper piston rod. 

Compression adjustment 

The compression is adjusted at the lower end of the separate valve at the front and rear by means of 
two knurled wheels marked with “Lowspeed” and “Highspeed”. Both speed ranges can be adjusted 
separately from each other. Adjustment is performed from closed position (max. hardness) towards 
the soft setting. Closed condition is reached when the knurled wheel is turned clockwise (+) in 
hard direction until it reaches the limit position. The effective adjustment range is 0 - 6 clicks in the 
“Lowspeed” range towards soft and 0 -14 clicks in the “Highspeed” range towards soft. 

The compression damping is made softer by turning the wheel counter-clockwise (-). 

A 

The knurled wheel operates a precision-engineered valve. Do not under any circumstances attempt to 
exceed the end of the adjustment range with force. This will damage the adjustment mechanism and 
necessitate exchange of the complete shock absorber. 


68 






F82 GTS Complete Vehicle 

5. Chassis and Suspension 

The F82 M4 GTS is delivered with a basic compression setting. If the shock absorbers are reset to the 
basic compression setting, the values described in the Supplementary Owner's Handbook apply. 

Further information on use and maintenance of the chassis and suspension is also provided in the 
Supplementary Owner's Handbook. 


5.3. Wheel alignment 

The following test conditions must be observed before wheel alignment: 

• Only wheel and tire combinations approved by BMW fitted on the vehicle. 

• Tread depth in accordance with specification. The tread depth may differ between 
left and right by a maximum of 1 mm to 2 mm on each axle. 

• Tire pressure in accordance with specification (see label on vehicle). 

• All chassis and suspension components must be technically fault-free. 

• Condition of suspension and shock absorbers OK: visual inspection for breakage, etc. 


A 


A wheel alignment can be performed only taking into account the correct ride heights and wheel loads.

5.3.2. Procedure 

1. Adjust damping levels on front axle. 

Rebound (support bearing): Turn knurled wheel to closed position, then open to basic setting as 
described in the Supplementary Owner's Handbook. 

Compression (damper, bottom): Turn knurled wheel to closed position, then open to basic setting 
as described in the Supplementary Owner's Handbook. 


69 








F82 GTS Complete Vehicle

2. Adjust damping levels on rear axle. 

Rebound (support bearing): Turn knurled wheel to closed position, then open to basic setting as 
described in the Supplementary Owner's Handbook. 

Compression (damper, bottom): Turn knurled wheel to closed position, then open to basic setting 
as described in the Supplementary Owner's Handbook. 

3. Check ride heights 

Drive vehicle from platform and carry out short test drive to relieve the axle mounting. After pre¬ 
adjustment as described above, the following ride height should be obtained on the vehicle: 

• Front suspension: setpoint value 624 mm ± 2 mm tolerance adjustable via the spring cups 
(settling of vehicle taken into account). 

• Rear suspension: setpoint value 631 mm ± 2 mm tolerance adjustable via the spring cups 
(settling of vehicle taken into account). 

The vehicle can be measured according to the repair instructions only if the ride height is correct - 
otherwise operations must be repeated as describe above and the ride heights corrected by adjusting 
the spring cups. 

Note: 

• Front axle height adjustment - pitch 2 mm per thread turn. Adjustment of 1 mm at the spring 
strut results in a height change on the body of 1 mm. 

• Rear axle height adjustment - pitch 2 mm per thread turn. Adjustment of 1 mm at the 
mounting plate results in a height change on the body of 1.6 mm. 


4. Carry out wheel load optimization 

• Place vehicle on wheel load weighing scales. 

• Load driver's seat with 80 kg /176 lbs. 

• Vehicle with full fuel tank. 

If the cross weight (front left-rear right/front right-rear left) is within ± 15 kg / 33 lbs, wheel alignment 
can be performed according to the repair instructions and the current nominal values. 

If the cross weight is outside the tolerance, the wheel loads must be adjusted correctly by adjusting 
the spring cups, taking into account the ride height tolerances ± 2 mm. Correction should preferably 
be carried out on the rear axle. 

5. Carry out wheel alignment on the front and rear axles. 

• Front axle single wheel toe 5’± T 

• Rear axle single wheel toe 9’± T 

• Rear axle camber-2° ± 10’ 


70 



F82 GTS Complete Vehicle 

5. Chassis and Suspension 

6. Adjust wheel loads 

• Place vehicle on wheel load weighing scales. 

• Load driver's seat with 80 kg /176 lbs. 

• Vehicle with full fuel tank. 

Adjustment of the cross weight (front left-rear right/front right-rear left) to ± 15 kg / 33 lbs and within ± 
2 mm ride height tolerance. 

If the cross weight is outside the tolerance, the wheel loads must be adjusted correctly by adjusting 
the spring cups, taking into account the ride height tolerances ± 2 mm. Correction should preferably 
be carried out on the rear axle. 

7. Lock the blocking rings on the front axle 

After correct wheel alignment, the blocking rings or ring on the front axle must be turned to the limit 
position at the bottom of the C clip. When the blocking ring is in the limit position, tighten the tear-off 
screw to finally secure the set screw until the tear-off screw tears off. This secures the blocking ring to 
prevent manipulation and prevents further lowering of the vehicle by the customer. 

Undo spring cup by approx, a Va turn so that it is easier to remove the spacer rings again later. 

8. Lock the blocking rings on the rear axle 

Lower corresponding rear axle side by removing the bottom fixing screw of the shock absorber eye. 
Take out the thread unit with the spring cup, blocking ring and vehicle mount. Fit C clip and turn the 
blocking ring to the limit position. When the blocking ring is in the limit position, tighten the tear-off 
screw to finally secure the set screw until the tear-off screw tears off. This secures the blocking ring to 
prevent manipulation and prevents further lowering of the vehicle by the customer. 

Undo the spring cup by approx, a Va turn so that it is easier to remove the spacer rings again later. 

Fit the thread unit with spring cup, blocking ring, C clip and vehicle mount in the vehicle again. Screw 
together the rear axle side with the bottom shock absorber eye again. 

A_ 

If chassis and suspension components were replaced which make it necessary to replace or open 
the blocking ring, the new blocking ring must be secured again by a tear-off screw after correct wheel 
alignment.

The M carbon ceramic brake, familiar from the F82 BMW M4 Coupe as optional equipment, is fitted as 
the standard brake system on the F82 M4 GTS. Motor sports-oriented braided steel brake hoses are 
also used. 

The M Carbon ceramic brake system is also called the C/SiC brake system. 

Depending on the situation, this offers a further increase in active safety vis-a-vis the M Compound 
brake. In a direct comparison it also offers: 

• Even more direct/spontaneous use of brake force. 

• Maximum heat resistance even with continuous sporty operation. 

• Higher fading stability. 

• Greatly reduced wear on the brake discs. 

• 7 kg /15 lbs weight reduction of rotating wheel masses. 

• Increased suitability for winter driving conditions thanks to corrosion resistance.

and with activated driving dynamics systems. 

The Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires are similar to a pure sport tire in terms of design, structure and 
rubber compound, but have a dominant influence on the excellent drivability of the F82 M4 GTS 
thanks to their very heat-resistant rubber compound.

more potential for longitudinal and lateral acceleration and for precision steering than comparable 
standard tires. They have an asymmetrical tread pattern with a high positive pattern share (large 
contact surface = few recesses). The tires wet performance is reduced. The customer must be 
informed about this by an additional sheet as an appendix to the purchase contract when purchasing 
the F82 M4 GTS. The Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires have the following properties and advantages: 

• High tread depth Improved grip and later hydroplaning tendency while driving on normal 
roads. 

• Two-component technology Two different rubber compounds on the outside and inside of 
the tire tread surface. The outer side tire compound consists of highly linked elastomers which 
offer optimum grip and abrasion protection in tight corners. The tire inner side comprises hard 
elastomers which improve steering precision and offer optimum grip on wet road surfaces.

The following must be observed before intensive race track use: 

• Always check the condition of the tires for wear and possible damage. 

• Warm up the tires by driving moderately for a few laps. 

• The optimum tire pressure of the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 is between 2.0 bar (29 psi) and 
2.9 bar (42 psi) at the front and rear. 

• Never drive with a tire pressure of less than 2.0 bar (29 psi). 

Observe the following after race track use and before driving on public roads: 

• Adjust the tire pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacture on the cold tire. 

• Allow the tire to cool down before making corresponding tire pressure adjustments. 

• Always check the condition of your tires to make sure that they comply with the legal 
regulations for use on public roads. 

• If the driving dynamics systems were deactivated, activate these again. 

TIRE PRESSURE RECOMMENDATIONS 

The correct tire pressures for approved tire sizes can be found on the door post of the driver's door. 
Further information on tire pressures is provided in the Supplementary Owner's Handbook. The 
pressure specifications apply for tires at ambient temperature. 


A 

ATTENTION 

• If the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires are not used for an extended period, it is recommended 
to remove the wheels from the vehicle and to reduce the tire pressure to half the usual value. 

• The tires should be stored in a clean, dry and dark location in accordance with the 
recommendations from Michelin and at temperatures above 0 °C / 32 °F. 

• The use, storage or handling of Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires at ambient temperatures 
below minus -10 °C /14 °F should be avoided. Elements of the rubber compound may be 
damaged under these conditions. This will impair the performance characteristics of the 
tire and may even cause cracks or breaks in the tire tread which make further use of the tire 
impossible. 

• Never use a tire that has cracks, breaks or other damage on the tire tread or sidewalls. In case 
of doubt, the customer should consult BMW Service.

5. Chassis and Suspension 

• In the case of intensive race track use, the tires or tire casing may become damaged after 
extended driving and frequent driving over the curb. 

• The tires must be checked carefully if they have been frequently driven over curb or the 
vehicle has left the track. In such a case, it is necessary to remove the tire from the wheel in 
order to inspect both the outer and inner sides of the tire. 

• A visual check of the tires must be performed after every “run” and before returning to the 
track.

6.1. Active Sound Design ASD 

The Active Sound Design ASD is not installed in the F82 M4 GTS. 


6.2. Heating and air conditioning system 

The integrated 1/1 single zone heating/air conditioning system is used in the F82 M4 GTS. 

The integrated 2/1 zone automatic heating/air conditioning system is not available for the F82 M4 GTS 
for weight reasons. 

In the zone specification the first number denotes the number of controllable temperature zones 
(temperature selector wheels) and the second number the number of controllable airflow volume and 
air distribution zones (separate fan settings). 


6.3. Radio and speaker system 

The radio and speaker system was also reduced to a minimum for weight and concept reasons. 

As a result, 2 central bass speakers are used under the front seats. These are supplemented by 2 mid¬ 
range speakers on the left and right of the storage shelf supported by 2 tweeters which complete the 
audio system in the F82 M4 GTS.

7. Information for Service 

7.1. F82 M4GTS 

• At the vehicle handover, the customer must sign a handover record which informs him about 
the special features of the F82 BMW M 4 GTS. The customer must confirm the content of this 
handover record with his signature. In the handover record, the customer is informed, among 
other things, about reduced comfort in the areas of drive system and chassis and suspension 
as well as about the deviating conditions for use of the F82 M4 GTS. 


7.2. Replacement part orders 

• The complete replacement parts supply for the F82 M4 GTS is done through the central BMW 
Group Parts organization. As usual, the vehicle must be identified via the Electronic Parts 
Catalogue with the vehicle identification number. The GTS-specific parts are also output via 
the EPC with the part number for the F82 M4 GTS. 

• Replacement part supply for specific parts of all predecessors of the F82 M4 GTS is handled 
through BMW M GmbH. Supplementary part numbers for the M3 GTS and CRT can be 
obtained from the ASAP “Aftersales Assistance Portal”. All BMW M4 common parts can be 
identified directly in the Electronic Parts Catalogue and ordered from the central BMW Group 
Parts organization. 


7.3. Body 

• The prescribed settings of the front spoiler for street use as well as the recommendations for 
motor sports settings and tightening torques are described in the Supplementary Owner's 
Handbook. 

• The prescribed settings of the rear spoiler for street use as well as the recommendations for 
motor sports settings and tightening torques are described in the Supplementary Owner's 
Handbook of the F82 M4 GTS. 

• In general, the further the front spoiler is extended, the larger the inclination angle of the rear 
spoiler should be. Otherwise, a safe vehicle balance is not guaranteed at high speeds. 

• Adjustments to the rear spoiler must be performed only when the trunk is closed. When 
undoing the screws, it must be ensured that the rear spoiler does not tip down. 


7.4. Seat belts 

• The six-point seat belts for driver and front passenger must be fitted only for race track 
operation. Separate instructions for use/installation instructions for the six-point seat belts are 
required. 

• Three-point seat belts are installed from the factory and must be used for street operation.

7.5. S55B30T0 engine 

• Like on the F80/F82 and F83, the engine oil is currently renewed at 2,000 km /1200 mile 
(running-in check). After this, the running-in check must be reset with the BMW workshop 
system Integrated Service Technical Application ISTA. 

• Changed engine oil fill quantity for the S55 engine in the F82 M4 GTS. The fill quantity for an 
engine oil change with filter is 7 liters. Engine oil fill quantity without filter exchange 6.5 liters. 


7.6. Water injection 

• When the engine is switched off and the water injection system is drained, operating noises 
occur which may be perceived by the customer. These operating noises cannot be avoided 
due to the operating principle of the system. 

• When filling the water injection system, only commercially available distilled water 
(demineralized - decalcified) must be used for the F82 M4 GTS. Other fluid, mixtures or 
mixtures with alcohols are not approved by BMW. 

• The 10 pm fine filter in the valve block can be removed and installed by means of the hexagon 
screw. The fine filter should be replaced at every 2nd oil service/20,000 miles. 

• The water injection system can be diagnosed via the DME. The current information and 
specifications in the documents in the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA) must be 
observed in each case. 

• The water consumption depends greatly on the vehicle operating conditions and varies 
correspondingly. As a rule of thumb, a consumption of 0.6 / — 1 liter per 100 km or 0.15 
gallons - 0.26 gallons per 62 miles can be expected on the race track. In the case of dynamic 
motorway driving (engine speed > 5000 rpm and high load) in everyday use, it will probably be 
necessary to top up with water at only every 5th refuelling operation. 

• If water injection is no longer available, the engine power will then correspond to the standard 
power of the S55 engine. 

Further information on use and maintenance of the water injection system is provided in the 
Supplementary Owner's Handbook. 


7.7. M DCT 

Maximum cleanliness must be ensured if work has to be performed on the oil circuit of the twin-clutch 
gearbox, e.g. after an accident, or if the oil circuit has to be opened due to a repair. This includes: 

• Carefully clean the external oil circuit areas before disassembling the components or opening 
the oil circuit. 

• Immediately close off openings and lines after disassembly without delay using clean, original 
seal plugs. Do not use unsealed components or replacement parts of the oil circuit without 
checking for cleanliness and where possible competent repair. 

• The workbay at which an M DCT is opened must be absolutely clean and protected against 
dirt contamination. If interrupted during repairs, clean and lint free cloths must be used to 
protect exposed components.

F82 GTS Complete Vehicle 

7. Information for Service 


As for the F80/F82 and the F83 with M DCT Drivelogic, no transmission oil change is currently 
planned. 

Depending on the type of repair, the data status of the M DCT must be read out beforehand and read 
in again after the component has been replaced (e.g. replacement of mechatronics module). 

Depending on the type of repair (e.g. dual clutch change), the "Neutral" gear selection position must 
be selected before the engine is stopped. 

The emergency gearbox release is not installed like on the F80/F82 and F83. For towing away, please 
observe the information in the Owner's Handbook of the vehicle. 


7.8. Launch Control and wheelspin start 

• The Launch Control and wheelspin start functions should generally not be used during the 
first 5,000 km / 3,100 miles when running in the vehicle (see also the chapter Driving tips in 
the Owner's Handbook). 

• The 2,000 km /1,200 mile running-in check must have been completed and reset/confirmed 
with the Integrated Service Technical Application (ISTA) (do not reset via the instrument 
cluster service function, as otherwise the Launch Control and wheelspin start functions are 
not enabled). 

• Premature wear occurs as a result of the high load on the vehicle components when using the 
Launch Control and wheelspin start functions. 


7.9. Active M differential 

• For a replacement of the GHAS control unit an encoding (activation of vehicle-related 
characteristic curve) and then an initial calibration are necessary and then the fault memory 
must be deleted. 

• After the replacement of the entire M rear axle differential a calibration must be performed and 
then the fault memory must be deleted. 

• For a replacement of the electric motor, electric motor plus intermediate gear or oil 
temperature sensor, only the fault memory must be deleted. 

• The final drive differential oil is currently replaced at 2,000 km /1,200 miles (running-in check) 
and at every fifth engine oil change. After this, the running-in check must be reset with the 
BMW workshop system Integrated Service Technical Application ISTA. 


7.10. Adjustable high-performance chassis and suspension 

• Under no circumstances must the vehicle be driven with one axle at the maximum hard 
damper setting in combination with the other axle at the maximum soft setting. 

• The knurled wheel for damper adjustment operates a precision-engineered valve. Do not 
under any circumstances attempt to exceed the end of the adjustment range with force.

7. Information for Service 

This will damage the adjustment mechanism and necessitate the exchange of the complete 
shock absorber. 

• The F82 M4 GTS is delivered with a basic compression and rebound setting. If the shock 
absorbers are reset to the basic compression and rebound setting, the values described in the 
Supplementary Owner's Handbook apply. 

• A hook wrench for lowering and a knurled wheel with hexagon for adjusting the damper 
are included in the toolkit for this purpose. 

• Further information on use and maintenance of the adjustable high-performance chassis and 
suspension is provided in the Supplementary Owner's Handbook. 


7.11. Wheel alignment 

• Awheel alignment can be performed only by taking into account the correct ride heights and 
wheel loads. 

• If chassis and suspension components were replaced which make it necessary to replace or 
open the blocking ring, the new blocking ring must be secured again by a break off screw after 
correct wheel alignment. 


7.12. Tires 

• If the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires are not used for an extended period, it is recommended 
to remove the wheels from the vehicle and to reduce the tire pressure to half the usual value. 

• The tires should be stored in a clean, dry and dark location in accordance with the 
recommendations from Michelin and at temperatures above 0 °C / 32 °F. 

• Use, storage or handling of Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires at ambient temperatures below 
minus -10 °C / +14 °F should be avoided. Elements of the rubber compound may be damaged 
under these conditions. This will impair the performance characteristics of the tire and may 
even cause cracks or breaks in the tire tread which make further use of the tire impossible. 

• Never use a tire that has cracks, breaks or other damage on the tire tread or sidewalls. In case 
of doubt, the customer should consult BMW Service. 

• In the case of intensive race track use, the tires or tire casing may become damaged after 
extended driving and frequent driving over the curb. 

• The tires must be checked carefully if they have been frequently driven over curb or the 
vehicle has left the track. In such a case, it is necessary to remove the tire from the wheel in 
order to inspect both the outer and inner sides of the tire. 

• A visual check of the tires must be performed after every “run” and before returning to the 
track. 

• The correct tire pressures for approved tire sizes can be found on the door post of the 
driver's door. Further information on tire pressures is provided in the Supplementary Owner's 
Handbook. 

• Further information on use and maintenance of the tires is provided in the Supplementary 
Owner's Handbook.
