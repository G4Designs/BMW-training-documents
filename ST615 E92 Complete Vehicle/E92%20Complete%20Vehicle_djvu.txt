Introduction 



The third generation of the 3 Series Coupes is here, developed on the basis of the E90 
and honoring the long line of BMW coupes of the past with its sporty new 2 door body 
styling. The use of lighter and stronger body components, more powerful engines and 
enhanced features make this coupe stand out among its competition.

The 335i will replace the 330i and it gets the new N54 twin turbo, direct injected engine 
with 300hp and 300ft/lb. The 328i will replace the 325i and will come with a further 
developed N52 engine with increased horse power to 230hp and torque to 200ft/lb. 
There is also a N51 SULEV engine that will be available only with automatic transmission. 


• The front fenders and rocker panel covers are fabricated from Thermo-Plastic mater¬ 
ial to promote weight distribution 

• Upgraded brakes on 335i: front disc diameter increased from 13.0 (330i) to 13.7 in. 

• New lighting features like Bi-Xenon headlamps standard the addition of Welcome 
lights (a BMW first) that greet the driver as the vehicle is opened. Adaptive head¬ 
lights with Cornering lights help illuminate around the dark corners as well as 
Daytime running lights with corona rings promote daytime vehicle visibility. 

• Vehicle security is enhance with the use of EWS4 immobilizer.

Body Structure 

A stronger and lighter body is constructed of a combination of different types of materials 
including many metals of different composition and even Plastic. This increases rigidity 
and provides more structural support where needed with out scarifying vehicle overall 
weight. The passive safety principle is based on retaining the passenger cell with 
dynamic deformation zones. 

• Carrier structures with a high load bearing capacity 

• Optimum utilization of deformation ranges 

• Extremely rigid passenger cell 

• Effective restraint systems

Fenders and Rocker Panel Covers 



Fenders and Rocker Panel Covers 

Like the 6 Series, Thermo Plastic is used in the 
construction of the two front fenders and rocker 
panels covers, to promote weight distribution. 

This plastic injection method of fabricating parts 
allows for more freedom of design than ever possi¬ 
ble with the stamping method. The resulting com¬ 
ponents are not only lighter they are less expensive 
to produce. 

This plastic compound has been enhanced to sup¬ 
port the refinishing process, in that it doesn’t need 
to rest before we paint it for it retains its shape bet¬ 
ter and the mounting holes are slotted to compen¬ 
sate for possible expansion. 


Note: The use of these components results in 
a 20 lb overall reduction of the vehicle 
body weight, that enhances fuel 
economy and performance.

Door Construction 



Doors 

The doors are longer than a 6 Series, but lighter than the E46. This was achieved by the 
use of Tailored Blanks in their construction. 

With its shell construction the weight of the frameless steel door of the E92 has been 
reduced by 2.5 kg compared to the predecessor model (E46 Coupe) despite product- 
specific improvements. 

• Stiffer hinge design layout minimizes the lowering effect of the door in response to 
force application. 

• Holding forces of the door retainer that prevent the door swinging back when 
opened have been increased in the two arrest positions, i.e. initial and main arrest 
positions. 

• The dent rigidity of the outer skin panel has been increased compared to that on the 
E46 Coupe. 

• Two side impact carriers in each door reduce intrusion in the event of side impact so 
that the occupants are protected from serious injuries in the area of the legs, pelvis 
and torso. 

The lighter weight of the E92 doors compared to those of the E46 Coupe were achieved 
primarily by the use of tailor blanks in the inner door panel. (Metal plates of different thick¬ 
nesses are joined by laser welding to achieve a lighter and stronger component) 

The high rigidity of the door and the passive safety for the occupants are achieved by 2 
side impact carriers, of which the upper carrier has a double groove section and the lower 
carrier a single groove section to provide higher strength levels. In addition, a crash pad in 
the E92 (Europe version) reduces the load in the pelvic area in the vent of side impact. 
Expanded foam on the side impact carriers additionally increases the dent rigidity of the 
door outer skin panel.

Car Access System 3 with EWS4 


With the launch of the E92, a new electronic vehicle immobilizer. The EWS4 features an 
ultramodern encryption method with a 124 bit secrete key. Start enable involves a spe¬ 
cial check procedure. A random number is generated in the DME and sent to the CAS. 
The CAS calculates the result from the random number and the secrete key and sends it 
back to the DME. The DME performs the same calculations and therefore already knows 
the result. Start enable takes place when both results are identical. 

The car access system 3 with the new generation of electronic vehicle immobilizer 
EWS4 was introduced in E92 vehicles with the N52/N54 gasoline engine. 

The vehicle immobilizer consists of the ID transmitter which is identical for the vehicle 
and therefore to CAS3. CAS3 exchanges data with the DME via the CAS-bus and can¬ 
cels the vehicle immobilization function. 

The EWS4 is a new development and uses a new, modern encryption method. A 128 
bit long secret key is assigned to each vehicle and stored in the BMW database. 

This secrete key is known only to BMW. The secrete key is programmed and locked in 
the CAS and in the DME control unit. Once entered in the control unit, the secrete key 
can no longer be changed or deleted. This therefore means that each control unit is 
assigned to a specific vehicle. 

One control unit in the system sends an encrypted code to another control unit for the 
purpose of checking the authorization. In turn, this control unit sends back a correspond¬ 
ing code. 

Replacement of Control Units 

The procedure described below must be followed in order to replace a defective control 
unit (CAS/DME). The reguired control unit is ordered together with the necessary vehicle 
data (VIN) from the Parts Department. 

A new "blank" control unit is programmed with the corresponding program data for the 
vehicle and the secrete key from the BMW database, locked and sent to the dealer. 

The new control unit is installed in the vehicle and started. 

Note: No alignment procedure is necessary as in earlier EWS systems. Since 
the control units are assigned to the specific vehicle, replacement with 
a unit from another vehicle is not possible.

E92 Complete Vehicle 

















































The electronic vehicle immobilizer consists of several components. In the E92 these 
components are the CAS3 and the DME MSV80/MSD80. 

The CAS3 contains the software for the EWS4 and, with corresponding identification of 
the ID transmitter, the enable of terminal R, 15 and 50 for the starter. The enable for the 
ignition and fuel injection systems is done by the DME. 

Both control units are connected by the K-CAN, the junction box serving as the gateway 
and the PT-CAN. Data is also exchanged on the CAS-bus. The data is always transmitted 
parallel via both bus systems.The signals that arrive first are used. 

The DME activates the fuel injection relay for the power supply of the fuel injectors. The 
DME features a direct line to the starter relay in the CAS in order to initiate the start pro¬ 
cedure and, if necessary, to terminate it, in the event of a PT-CAN fault or a faulty signal, 
like no engine speed signal. 


11 

E92 Complete Vehicle 



EWS4 Immobilizer 



Start Enable 

The start procedure is enabled by means of a special request and response procedure 
known as challenge-response. The DME generates a random number in a random gen¬ 
erator and sends it as the challenge to the CAS. The CAS and the DME contain the 
same secrete key and both control units use the same calculation algorithm. The CAS 
now calculates the result from the received random number, the secrete key and the 
algorithm. The result is sent as the CAS response to the DME. During this time, the DME 
now calculates the same random number with the secrete key and the algorithm and 
already knows the result. The response of the CAS is compared with the result of the 
DME. Start is enabled if the result is identical. 

Time-based Query 

As from terminal R or terminal 15 ON, a query (challenge-response) is performed as long 
as the engine is not yet running. A fault code is entered in the CAS if no DME response is 
received approx. 10 seconds after the start of the query or if the response deviates.

Key Memory Expansion in CAS3 

The data memory of the remote key in vehicles equipped with CAS3 is increased from 
256 bytes to 512 bytes. 

The benefit of this key memory expansion for the customer is that more accurate informa¬ 
tion on the time and scope of the workshop visit can be provided as part of the service 
acceptance procedure. 

The following system network information can be read out from the identification trans¬ 
mitter with the key reader in the service workshop.

Electric steering column adjustment ELV dropped on US vehicles with manual 
transmission. 

Legal Requirements 

The US regulation (FMVSS114) reguires that vehicles must be eguipped with a key- 
based locking system that prevents either steering or forward propulsion under the vehi¬ 
cle's own power or both. This reguirement can be met either by a steering wheel lock 
ELV or by an electronic vehicle immobilizer EWS. 

In addition, the regulation also states that on 
vehicles with automatic transmission and a park 
position, the ignition key or ID generator can only 
be removed when the selector lever is locked in 
the park position (Interlock). 

Emergency release of the selector lever in the 
case of an electrical defect, is permitted on vehi¬ 
cles without ELV only if the emergency release 
facility is operated with the key. 

Manual Transmission Vehicles 

Based on the specified legal reguirements, an 
electronic vehicle immobilizer EWS is sufficient 
on manual transmission vehicles and the ELV 
can be dropped. 

Automatic Transmission Vehicles 

The ELV cannot be dropped on automatic transmission vehicles as these vehicles do not 
feature an emergency release facility for the selector lever with the key. 

In the case of failure of the vehicle electrical system, the selector lever on automatic 
transmission vehicles can be released by operating the emergency release facility. The 
emergency release is accessible after removing the selector lever cover. The selector 
lever is released by pressing the pawl (1).

Exterior Lighting 


Compared to the E90, several changes have been made in the exterior lighting system 
of the E92: 

• The E92 is eguipped with standard bi-xenon headlights. 

• Adaptive headlights with cornering lights are available as an option. 

• Standard daytime running light function, realized by the parking light corona rings. 

Welcome Lights 

The welcome lights are also a new function. The interior lights are activated for 20 sec. 
when the vehicle is unlocked but also the parking light corona rings, the tail lights, 
license plate lights, the door handle area lights and side markers. 

Note: The welcome lights operate only in automatic and are not activated when 
the light switch is in the 0 position.This provides the customer with the 
option of deactivating the system if he/she does not want this function. 




15 

E92 Complete Vehicle 







Daytime Running Lights 


The E92 is equipped with bi-xenon headlights as standard. The daytime running lights 
function is introduced in connection with the bi-xenon headlights.The daytime running 
lights serve as an additional safety feature as the vehicle can be better seen. 


The daytime running lights function is 
realized by the two corona rings in the 
headlights and activation of the tail 
lights and license plate lights. 

The corona rings light brighter during 
the day to realize the daytime running 
lights function.The brightness of the 
corona rings is reduced to that of the 
side lights when the low beam head¬ 
light is switched on by the rain/light 
sensor or by switch position 2. 

The corona rings are always switched 
on at terminal 15 ON. The corona rings 
are activated pulse width-modulated. 
The pulse width modulation ensures 
the daytime running lights and parking 
light function can be realized with one 
lamp bulb. 



Note: In the event of a defective bulb in the tail lights, after removal, the bulb 
carrier must be fitted in the tail light housing otherwise the function of 
the new bulb cannot be checked due to the lack of ground connection. 


16 

E92 Complete Vehicle 




Light distribution in headlight for daytime running light function 

The daytime running light uses the same corona rings as the side lights. Both corona 
rings feature a common H8 bulb. The H8 lamp bulb is activated differently depending on 
the side light or daytime running light function. The inner ring is illuminated from the rear 
by reflectors. The outer rings around the headlight are supplied via fiber optic glass rods. 
The light from the H8 bulb is directed by mirrors into the fiber optic glass rods. 

Deactivating the daytime running lights function 

The function can be deactivated if reguired by the customer. On vehicles eguipped with a 
central information display, the function can be deactivated in the "Light settings" 
menu.The function is deactivated in the instrument cluster on vehicles with no CID. 

Cornering Lights 

Cornering lights will be introduced for the first time with the launch of the E92.They rep¬ 
resent an expansion of the functions of the adaptive headlights. In addition to the adaptive 
headlight, the cornering light illuminates the area in front of and to the side the vehicle. 
The cornering light is integrated in the headlight where the previous high beam lamp was 
located The light beam is reflected to the side by the special shape of the deflector and 
the position of the H3 bulb. The cornering light cannot be ordered as a separate option 
as it is an added function of Adaptive Headlights (SA 524). 




17 

E92 Complete Vehicle 








Advantages of the Cornering Light 

The cornering light makes it possible to recognize people or traffic situations earlier in the 
turning area. As the following example shows, pedestrians are recognized before the 
vehicle actually turns . This function represents a considerable increase in safety for the 
driver and other road users. 



The special arrangement of the mirror surface in the reflector and the special shape of 
the lens deflect the light beams to the side while preventing forward dazzle. 



The angle of the steering wheel to acti¬ 
vate the cornering light differs depend¬ 
ing on the type of steering system used 
(power steering or active steering), 
steering gear and steering gear ratio. 
The steering wheel lock to activate 
the cornering light when the vehicle 
is stationary is between approximately 
40° and 75° depending on the type of 
steering. 


Flash to pass does not affect the cor¬ 
nering light nor does the hazard func¬ 
tion activate it. 


The cornering lights illuminate when the 
steering angle sensor indicates a turn 
below 40mph. 


respective turn signal is operated and or the 


Note: Both cornering lights come on when the reverse gear is selected to help 
illuminate the way.

Switch-on conditions for the cornering lights 

The corresponding cornering lights will illuminate depending on the following criteria: 

• The selection of the turn signal below 65kph/40mph 

• Steering angle input while driving below 65kph/40mph 

• With vehicle stationary and engine running a steering angle of 40° to 70° 
depending on the steering system 

• With reverse gear engaged both cornering light will illuminate 


Switch-off conditions for the cornering light 

The cornering light switches off in the following conditions: 

• Adaptive headlight off 

• Direction indicator off 

• Directional constantly on above 40kph/25mph 

• Steering angle is reduced ( by 5°-10° after switch-on condition with 
vehicle stationary) 

• Steering angle increased while driving above 70kph/43mph 

• While drifting (Steering lock and yaw rate in opposite directions) 

• While turning at a traffic light there is a 4 sec time out 

• Headlight temperature too high (headlight protection) 

• Reverse gear disengaged

Interior and Lighting 


The interior lights package of the E92 has been expanded by two functions. 


The E92 has two rear compartment footwell lights 
that facilitate entry in the rear compartment. The 
E92 also features ambient linear lighting in the 
doors and side trim panels. 

The door and side trim panels are illuminated indi¬ 
rectly by fiber optic cables from the strip. 

An LED provides the light source for the fiber optic 
cables. The fiber optic cable is made of plastic with 
small notches from which the light emits. The 
length of the fiber optic cable and the number of 
notches provide area lighting over the door and side 
trim panel. 





The interior differs from that of the 
E90 and the E46 in that the E92 is a 
four passenger vehicle. 

Like the E46 convertible the E92 also 
incorporates the easy-entry feature 
that facilitates the entry and exit of the 
rear of the vehicle by using an electric 
motor to move the seats forward and 
back on its rails. 

The most distinctive feature is the 
addition of driver and passenger side 
electric seat belt extenders, making 
the seat belts more accessible to the 
occupants due to the larger door and 
the position of the B-pillar, which 
makes reaching the seat belt difficult. 



22 

E92 Complete Vehicle 







Seat Belt Extender 


In line with its concept and design, the E92 Coupe features large doors. As a result, the 
B-pillar with the reversal point for the seat belt is located further towards the rear relative 
to the seat position. This makes the seat belt difficult to reach for the driver or front pas¬ 
senger. 


For this reason, an electrically operated seat belt extender is installed on the E92. The 
seat belt extender extends and moves the seat belt out of its rest position at the B-pillar 
by approximately 25 cm in the direction of the driver and front passenger. This makes it 
considerably easier and more convenient for the driver and front passenger to fasten the 
seat belt. 




23 

E92 Complete Vehicle 








System Function 

The seat belt extender system essentially consists of the footwell module with the master 
functionality and the two seat belt extender controllers connected via the LIN-BUS. 

The footwell module receives the terminal status from the car access system via the K- 
CAN. The footwell module receives further important information from the airbag control 
unit via the K-CAN. The information contains the status of the seat belt contacts and of 
the seat occupancy detection facility on the front passenger seat. 

The footwell module evaluates this information together with the determined status of the 
door contacts and decides whether the seat belt extenders are extended or retracted. 

The footwell module informs the seat belt controllers of this decision via the LIN-bus. 

The corresponding seat belt controller activates the seat belt extender motor and extends 
or retracts the toothed rack of the seat belt extender. The seat belt controller evaluates 
the Hall signals for the speed and end position and informs the footwell module of the 
position. 

The functions of the seat belt extender are uniform throughout the world. Only a differ¬ 
ence is made between the driver and front passenger in terms of functionality. 

The driver and passenger doors must be closed the key in the ignition or the ignition on 
for the seat belt extenders to operate. 



24 

E92 Complete Vehicle 




















System Components 

The system consists of the following components: 

• Controller for driver's seat belt extender GBFA 

• Controller for passenger's seat belt extender GBBF 

• Driver's seat belt extender 

- Seat belt extender motor 

- Hall sensor 

- End position sensor 

• Front passenger's seat belt extender 

- Seat belt extender motor 

- Hall sensor 

- End position sensor 

• Footwell module with sensors and LIN-bus connection 

• Junction box for power supply 

• Airbag control unit for sensor information 

Seat Belt Extender Controller 

The universal control unit that is also used in other systems is used as the controller for 
the seat belt extender. 

The controller for the seat belt extenders is connected via the LIN-bus to the footwell 
module. This LIN-bus has a data rate of 19.2 Kbit/s. 

The controllers for the driver/passenger seat belt extenders are identical and differ in 
terms of their ground coding. 

The control unit is connected by means of three plugs. Plug connector (1) is used for the 
power supply and ground coding. This plug connector also features the LIN-bus connec¬ 
tion. 

Plug connector (2) connects the end position sensor. Plug connector (3) connects the 
motor and the speed Hall sensor. (See graphic on the following page.)

The controller is located behind the side trim panel along with the seat belt extender. The 
controller is constantly monitoring the extension and retraction of the seat belt extender 
and it’s designed to shut down in the event of overvoltage (16V) or under voltage (9V) 
condition. 

Seat Belt Extender 

The driver/passenger seat belt extenders are identical in terms of design but is supplied 
as a left-hand and right-hand variant for mounting purposes. 

The seat belt extender consists of the following components: 

• Seat belt extender motor with gear unit 

• Hall sensor, motor 

• End position sensor 

• Toothed rack 

• Belt guide 

• Chrome cover

Seat Belt Extender Motor 

The seat belt extender motor is a DC motor. The motor is connected to the toothed rack 
by means of a step-down gear mechanism. A Hall sensor, mounted on the seat belt 
extender motor measures motor’s speed. 

A Hall signal is generated for each revolution of the motor. Based on the number of Hall 
signals, the control unit always knows the exact position of the seat belt extender. The 
Hall pulses are added as the seat belt extender extends and the motor is switched off on 
reaching the maximum number of pulses. This represents the "extended" end position. 

When the seat belt extender is retracted, power is applied to the motor until the magnet 
in the toothed rack reaches the end position sensor. The system is initialized by reaching 
the end position. Initialization is performed every time the seat belt is retracted. 

Note: Only the chrome cover or the complete seat belt extender can be 
replaced for repair purposes. 


27 

E92 Complete Vehicle 


















Blocking Detection 

If, during extension, the Hall signals are not received for 250ms, this situation is interpret¬ 
ed as blocking of the extender and the motor is switched off. The seat belt extender 
motor is reversed and the toothed rack retracted. 

The motor is driven for 1 second if the toothed rack is blocked. This procedure is repeat¬ 
ed up to three times. The motor is then no longer activated. 

A renewed attempt to drive the motor is made only on reactivation of the system (door 
contact and terminal R). The system must be checked by a BMW dealer workshop if the 
system is actually blocked mechanically.

Diagnosis 

Diagnosis of the controller for the seat belt extender or of the seat belt extender itself 
takes place through the footwell module. If there is a fault, e.g. a defective Hall sensor, the 
controller of the seat belt extender sends this status via the LIN-bus to the footwell mod¬ 
ule. The footwell module stores the fault code and communicates with the diagnosis tool. 

Coding 

After replacing the controller for the seat belt extender it must be encoded by the footwell 
module via the LIN-bus. It is not possible to address the LIN-bus control units direct.

Easy-Entry Function 


The electrically adjustable seats (comfort and sport) installed in the E92 are equipped 
with a rear compartment easy-entry function to facilitate entry in the rear compartment. 
For this purpose, an adjustment switch is provided on the upper end of the backrest in 
order to move the seat forward and backward at double the speed of the regular seat for¬ 
ward/ backward adjustment function. By mechanically releasing the seat backrest, it can 
be additionally tilted forward to create sufficient space for convenient entry. 



When entering the rear compartment, the customer can move the seat forward with the 
adjustment switch. By mechanically releasing the seat backrest, it can be additionally tilt¬ 
ed forward to create sufficient space for convenient entry. 

After entering the vehicle, the seat backrest is tilted back and the seat can be moved 
back using the adjustment switch. The seat moves back and assumes the previous 
position. The previous position is determined by means of a Hall sensor on the seat 
forward/backward adjustment motor. The signals are read into the driver/passenger 
seat module and correspondingly evaluated. 

For this reason, a front passenger seat module is installed on vehicles equipped with 
electrically adjustable seats. The front passenger seat module has no memory function.

Easy-Entry Function 



Front Seats 

The seat mechanism is designed such as to allow the customer to fold the backrest for¬ 
ward and push the seat in forward direction when accessing the rear seat. The backrest 
then remains locked in the frontmost position. When the seat is pushed back, it returns 
exactly to its original position and releases the backrest in this position. The electrically 
adjustable seat is moved forward by means of a switch located above the grip handle for 
moving the backrest forward. The seat moves at double the normal speed of the seat for¬ 
ward/backward adjustment.

Changes to the BUS Network 


With the adoption of the vehicle systems network from the E90 with the junction box as 
the gateway and the footwell module as a further control unit with many functions, the 
system overviews of the vehicle systems network are, to a large extent identical. 

The E90/E92 vehicle systems networks differ only slightly by the addition of new control 
units. The following changes have been made in the various bus systems: 

Changes in PT-CAN 

The transfer case control unit is installed in vehicles eguipped with the xDrive all-wheel 
drive system option. The DSC is replaced by the DXC. The DXC performs the functions 
of the DSC and has been expanded to include additional all-wheel drive functions. 

Changes in MOST 

IBOC In-Band On-Channel, a terrestrial digital radio, has been newly added. 

Changes in K-CAN 

Further exterior lighting functions have been implemented in the footwell module. These 
functions include : 

• Daytime driving lights 

• Welcome light 

• Cornering light on vehicles with active headlight 

The tire pressure monitoring system TPMS replaces the tire failure indicator RPA to con¬ 
form to US legal reguirements. 

The EWS 4 has been implemented in the CAS 3 on petrol engine vehicles. 

A 4-channel PDC for the rear is offered in the E92. There is no PDC button in the center 
console. 

A new addition is the front passenger seat module SMBF for evaluating the Hall sensor 
of the seat forward/backward adjustment facility on vehicles with electrically adjustable 
seats for the rear compartment easy entry function. 

Changes in LIN-bus 

New features in the LIN-bus include the two control units for the driver and front passen¬ 
ger seat belt extender. 


Note: There are no changes in the F-CAN system nor the Bit-serial Data 
interface (BSD).
