Wheel Alignment Procedures 


Introduction 


In this training module, the propertechniques for wheel alignment will be discussed and 
practically applied. In previous training modules, the fundamentals of basic suspension 
geometry and BMW suspension systems were learned. These skills, along with the 
objectives in this training module, should allow the technician to achieve accurate and 
consistent alignment results. 

It is crucial, when performing an alignment that the vehicle tracks in a straight line and 
the steering wheel is properly centered. This can only be accomplished by following the 
proper procedures and taking the necessary precautions during the alignment process. 

Before starting any alignment, it is crucial to perform a road test and a comprehensive 
vehicle inspection. During the road test, any irregularities should be noted. Check for 
any "pulling" or "wandering". Note any excessive play in the steering wheel etc. Also, 
check for any unusual behavior during braking. 

M ost importantly, this is an opportunity to verify any customer complaints. Afterthe 
alignment is complete, perform a final road test to make sure that all complaints have 
been rectified. 



Note: The intent ofthis training module is to emphasize proper BMW align¬ 
ment procedures. There is no specific reference to any particular brand 
of alignment equipment. Additional training (by the equipment manu¬ 
facturer) may be necessary to complete a successful alignment with the 
equipment used.

Alignment Procedures 


The following procedure is an outline to follow based on BMW procedures. The actual 
alignment procedures will vary depending upon the alignment equipment being used. 
Referto the alignment equipment manufacturers procedures for specific information. 

The steps listed below should be followed as closely as possible to perform a quality 
alignment. 

• Vehicle Inspection - The vehicle inspection should include a road test before 
and afterthe alignment. Note any concerns during the pre-alignment road test 
and verify that the concern has been rectified during the post-alignment road test. 

• Install Specified Weight - Check Group 32 Technical Data in TIS to determine 
the "Normal Position/ Inspection Conditions". Install Specified weight in vehicle 
and compensate forfuel by adding extra weight if needed. 

• Install Alignment Sensors - Install the necessary alignment sensors as perthe 
recommended procedures outlined by the alignment equipment manufacturer. 

• Compensate Sensors - Depending upon the type of alignment sensors being 
used, compensation may not be necessary. Compensation may require the vehicle 
to be lifted from the alignment rack. If so, be sure to remove the pins from the front 
and rear slip plates. If the sensors do not need to be compensated, the next step 
can be ignored. 

• LowerVehicle and J ounce - M ake sure the pins are removed from the slip 
plates. Lowerthe vehicle back onto the alignment rack and jounce the vehicle. 

This will insure that the suspension has settled. 

• Check Ride Height - Check ride height using metric tape measure. Ride height 
specifications can be found in Technical Data in TIS. Front ride height specs can 
be found under group 31 and rear can be found under group 33. Always check ride 
height after compensating the sensors. This will avoid having to check the ride 
heighttwice. 

• Perform Alignment - There and various types of alignment equipment used in 
BMW workshops. Referto the equipment manufacturers instructions for the next 
steps of the alignment. 

When performing an alignment of a vehicle equipped with air suspension (EHC), disable 
the system by removing the fuse forthe air supply system. This will insure that the ride 
height will stay consistent. 

Also, there will be additional steps required forvehicles equipped with Dynamic Stability 
Control (DSC). The steering angle sensors must be calibrated (adjusted). Failure to do 
so will cause DSC fault lamps to illuminate. 

Note: There are also special procedures forvehicle equipped with Active 
Steering. Active Steering in an optional system which is currently 
available on the E60, E63, E64 and the E90.

Vehicle Inspection 


Before attempting to align any vehicle, it is important to inspect the vehicle completely to 
insure there are no damaged or loose suspension components. Regardless of the age or 
mileage of the vehicle, a complete inspection should be performed. The following items 
should be checked thoroughly: 

• Tires and Wheels - Check tires for wear patterns that could indicate suspension 
problems. Make sure the tires are the correct size and type. Checkforthe correct 
inflation pressures. Look for wheel/rim damage which could indicate possible impact 
damage. 

• Wheel bearings - Check to make sure there is no excessive wheel bearing play. 
This needs to be addressed for safety reasons, but loose wheel bearings will affect 
the quality of the alignment as well. 

• Steering Linkage - Check the tie rods, center link, idler arm and pitman arm. 

On vehicles with rack and pinion steering, checkfor loose inner/outer tie rods etc. 

On vehicles with a center link, make sure the center link is level (see BM W TIS 
Repair Instructions). Check flexible coupling between steering shaft and rack and 
pinion assembly (or steering box). 

• Suspension Components - Check Struts/Shocks for leakage or damage. 

Check springs and perform ride height measurements. 

• Subframe - Check the front and rear axle carriers. Look for bent/twisted subframes. 
Checkthe crossmembers for evidence of shifting or displacement. Check 

the mounting bolts for "clean spots" which could indicate shifting or movement. 

• Brakes - Check braking system by road testing the vehicle. A road test could help 
to identify brake related issues such as pulling or brake induced vibrations. 

• Drivetrain - While road testing the vehicle, observe and vibrations and/or noises 
and try to isolate the cause. Noises and vibrations under acceleration (ratherthan 
coasting) maybe an indication of drivetrain issues. 

Road Testing 

Whenever possible, a vehicle should be road tested before and after an alignment. 

If time allows, drive on various road surfaces and note the vehicle behavior. Checkfor 
brake pull when stopping. And most importantly, note the position of the steering wheel 
before and afterthe alignment. These are important steps to avoid comebacks and 
unnecessary return visits.

Identification of Suspension 

When performing an alignment, the suspension variant must be identified. This insures 
that the correct alignment specifications are used and the ride height is correct. There 
are numerous suspension variants, there is the standard "series" production suspension, 
the "low slung" sports suspension, "M Sport Package" and the "Poor Road Surface" 
package. The latterterm is for Eastern Europe, this is not used in the US. 

There are various methods for determining the the suspension variant used. Referto 
repair instructions in Group 32 for more information. 

The following is a summary of some common models: 

• E38 - The "Sports" suspension variant is identified by paint markings on the front 
springs or by a front sway bar diameter of greater than 21.5 mm. 

• E65/E66 - There is no additional identification needed to determine suspension 
variant (atthis time). Check option codes to determine Sport suspension option. 

• E39 - There is a symbol (or code) located on the front strut assembly. There is a 
chart in repair instructions to match to the symbol found. 

• E36 - There is an auxiliary spring located on the front strut assembly. There is a 
measurement that needs to be made to determine suspension variant. Referto 
repair instructions for additional details. 

• E46 - There is a symbol (or code) located on the front strut assembly. There is a 
chart in repair instructions to match to the symbol found. 

• E83 - The sway bar diameter differs between "Sport" and "Non-Sport" versions. 
The "Non-Sport" sway bar is 23.5mm and the "Sport" version is 24.5mm. 

• E60/E61 - There is no additional identification needed to determine suspension 
variant (atthis time). Check option codes to determine Sport suspension option. 

• E63/E64 - There is no additional identification needed to determine suspension 
variant (atthis time). Check option codes to determine Sport suspension option. 

• E90 (E9X) - There is no additional identification needed to determine suspension 
variant (atthis time). Check option codes to determine Sport suspension option. 

• E53 (X5) - There is no additional identification needed to determine suspension 
variant (atthis time). Check option codes to determine Sport suspension option.

Ride Height Measurement 

When performing alignments on BMW vehicle, the ride height must be set and checked 
before proceeding with any measurement or adjustments. Ride height is measured from 
the lower edge of the wheel rim to the lower edge of the wheel housing. Ride height 
specifications are in millimeters. The specifications can be found in Technical Data. The 
front axle ride height is in Group 31 and the rear axle ride height is in Group 33. In order 
to obtain the correct specification, the vehicle and suspension type must be identified. 

Ride height specifications depend upon rim size (15", 16 ", 17 " etc.), engine size and 
the type of suspension. Depending upon the year and models, there can be up to four 
different types of suspension packages: 

• Series - Standard production vehicle 

• Low Slung Sports Suspension - This is used on vehicle with Sports Package 
Option. 

• Rough Road Package - For Eastern European Rough roads. Not used in US. 

• M Sports Package - Used on Motorsport vehicles orthose with M Package Option. 

The example shown below is the front ride height specification for an E39. This is found 
in Group 31 (Technical Data). The rear ride height can be found in group 33.

Ride Height 

When measuring ride height, measure from the lower edge of the wheel rim to the lower 
edge of the wheel opening. Use a metric tape measure with divisions of 1 mm. 



Z3 Ride Height 

When checking the ride height on the Z3, use special tool 313 010 to check the front 
ride height. The special tool is a substitute forthe lower edge of the wheel opening. 
Since the hood on the Z3 makes up part of the wheel opening, this tool is needed for 
more accurate results. 














Vehicle Loading 

In orderto obtain the correct ride height, the vehicle must be loaded with the specified 
weight. The normal specified weightfor most vehicles is as follows: 

• 68 kg. in each front passenger seat 

• 68 kg in the rear seat 

• 21 kg in the trunk 

• Fuel tank full. 

In Technical Data, there are two terms used to describe the position of the vehicle during 
alignment. There is the "Normal Position" and the "Design Position". The Normal 
Position refers to a vehicle without any weight added. The Design Position is a vehicle 
with the specified weight already added. 

Not all vehicle need to be weighed down. Usually, M otorsport vehicles are measured 
without any weight. Always checkTIS underTechnical Data Group 32. The propertest 
conditions can be found under "Normal Position/Inspection Conditions”. 

If the vehicle fuel tank is not full, compensate by adding weight in the trunk. Fuel is 
approximately 7 pounds (about 3.2kg) per gallon. For example: If the vehicle has an 18 
gallon tank and it is 1/2 full, add about 63 lbs. (about 28kg.) 


Note: Be aware that some alignment equipment manufacturer do not require 
the vehicle to be loaded down with weight. This depends entirely on the 
type of equipment and software version in use.

Alignment S ensor Mounting 

There are two types of alignment sensor mounting, this depends upon equipment used. 
Thefirsttype is the "Rim Clamp" Method which "clamps" on the edge of the wheel rim. 

Since this method used the wheel (rim) for reference, the sensor is not "true" to the 
actual suspension components. Therefore the sensor needs to be "compensated" or 
adapted to the wheel. This allows any wheel runout or mounting irregularities to be 
factored into the alignment process and ensure accurate alignments. 



The second type is the "Beissbarth" type clamp, this method allows the clamp to be 
indexed to the rotor hub through holes in the wheel rim. The clamp hold on to the tire 
tread with a spring loaded clamp. The "Beissbarth" clamping method does not have to 
be compensated due to the fact that the clamp is actually mounted to the rotor hub, 
theoretically this method eliminates the need for compensation. Always rememberthat 
the holes in the rim should be clean and free of excessive rust, this could cause irregular 
mounting and inaccurate alignment results.

Alignment S pecifications 

The alignment specifications can be found in Technical Data underGroup 32. There is a 
slight difference in terminology between this information and the information found on 
most alignment equipment. The following text should be helpful in understanding the 
different terms used. The alignment specifications are shown on the opposing page: 

• FrontToe - The Total Toe specification represents the left and right toe specs 
added together. Toe is measured in degrees and minutes. 

• FrontCamber- Camber is also measured in degrees and minutes. Camberis 
adjustable only a some vehicles. The maximum amount of Camber adjustment is 
approximately .5 +/- degrees. 

• Track Differential Angle with 20° lockon inside wheel - This angle is also 
known as "Toe Out on Turns". With the inside wheel turned to 20 degrees on the 
front turn plates, the difference in the toe angle should be as specified. 

• Caster - Caster must be measured by sweeping the wheel through an arc of 10-20 
degrees. (M ost alignment equipment requires at least 20 degrees). Ride height is 
crucial to this specification. If the vehicle is too high or low in the rear, the Caster 
measurement will be affected. Caster is NOT a "live angle”, the wheels must be 
"re-sweeped"to check the measurement again. Although Caster is NOT adjustable, 
it should always be checked to insure there is no "hidden damage". 

• Front Wheel Displacement - More commonly known as "Setback”, this is a mea¬ 
surement of the angle formed between the front axle to the Geometric Axis. The 
front axle centerline should be at 90 degrees to the Geometric Axis. A quick check 
of setback is to look to see if the wheel is centered in the wheel opening. Setback is 
a good diagnostic angle, if the Caster is off, the Setback measurement could 
indicate the cause. Look for bent suspension components or damaged suspension 
carrier/subframe. 

• Maximum Wheel Lock - Also known as "Maximum Steering Angle".This is the 
maximum angle of the wheels when turned to the inward and outward lock position. 
When this measurement is out of specification, check to see if the steering rack or 
steering box is centered. This can cause a hazardous condition and premature tire 
wear. 

• RearToe - J ust as with front toe, this is the combined measurement of the rear left 
and right toe. RearToe is also measured in Degrees and Minutes. 

• RearCamber- RearCamberis always slightly negative on BMW vehicles. 

Rear Camber adjustable on some models. 

• Geometrical Axis Deviation - The Geometrical Axis Deviation is also known as 
the "Thrust Angle". The optimum angle is zero degrees. The Thrust Angle is the 
angle formed between the Geometric Centerline and the Thrust Line which is the 
imaginary line which bisects the reartoe angle. A Thrust Angle of Zero Degrees is 
Optimal.

Wheel Alignment Procedures 






Explanation of Angles 

Depending upon the type of alignment equipment used, the specifications can be 
expressed a number of ways. The specifications for BMW vehicles are in degrees and 
minutes. Whenever possible, set the alignment equipment to read in degrees and 
minutes ratherthan inches etc. Some types of alignment equipment will have this option, 
this is more desirable than trying to convert from inches to degrees etc. 

The alignment angles are expressed in degrees and minutes. For example: 

6° 30' is expressed as 6 degrees, 30 minutes. 

There are 360 degrees in a circle and 60 minutes to each degree. Each minute is also 
subdivided into increments of 60 seconds, but adjustments this fine are rarely used.

Additional Special Tools 

When performing an alignment on a vehicle equipped with AFS (E6X only), the steering 
shaft needs to be held in place to prevent any movement when setting toe. Initially, a 
special tool was developed forthis procedure. Special tool # 32 4 150 was used to 
clamp onto a frame rail and then clamp the steering shaft to a fixed position. 

Subsequently, this special tool was redesigned and improved. Therefore, the original 
special tool (32 4 150) was upgraded with the installation of special tools 32 4 154 and 
32 4 155. Referto SIB 04 05 04 for more information. 



Note: E90 vehicles equipped with AFS do not require the special tool to hold 
the steering shaft.
