OBD II FUNCTION: Overview (On Board Diagnosis) 

Since the 1996 model year all vehicles must meet OBD II requirements. OBD II requires the 
monitoring of virtually every component that can affect the emission performance of a vehi¬ 
cle plus store the associated fault code and condition in memory. If a problem is detected, 
the OBD II system must also illuminated a warning lamp (Malfunction Indicator Light - MILD 
“Check Engine Light”” located on the vehicle instrument panel to alert the driver that a mal¬ 
function has occurred. In order to accomplish this task, BMW utilizes the Engine Control 
Module (ECM/DME) as well as the Automatic Transmission Control Module (EGS/AGS) and 
the Electronic Throttle Control Module (EML) to monitor and store faults associated with all 
components/systems that can influence exhaust and evaporative emissions.

OVERVIEW OF THE NATIONAL LOW EMISSION 
VEHICLE PROGRAM 


Emission Reduction Stages: 

While OBD II has the function of monitoring for emission related faults and alerting the oper¬ 
ator of the vehicle, the National Low Emission Vehicle Program requires a certain number 
of vehicles produced (specific to manufacturing totals) currently comply with the following 
emission stages; 

TLEV: Transitional Low Emission Vehicle 
LEV: Low Emission Vehicle 
ULEV: Ultra Low Emission Vehicle. 


Prior to the National Low Emission Vehicle Program, the most stringent exhaust reduction 
compliancy is what is known internally within BMW as HC II. The benefit of exhaust emis¬ 
sion reductions that the National Low Emission Vehicle Program provides compared with 
the HC II standard is as 
follows: 


Cold Engine Startup - 50 0 F 


TLEV- 50% cleaner. 
LEV- 70% cleaner. 
ULEV-84% cleaner.

Engine Management Systems 


























OBD II FUNCTION: DRIVING CYCLE 

As defined within CARB mail-out 1968.1: 

"Driving cycle" consists of engine startup and engine shutoff. 

"Trip" is defined as vehicle operation (following an engine-off period) of duration and dri¬ 
ving style so that all components and systems are monitored at least once by the diagnostic 
system except catalyst efficiency or evaporative system monitoring. This definition is sub¬ 
ject to the limitations that the manufacturer-defined trip monitoring conditions are all moni¬ 
tored at least once during the first engine start portion of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP). 

Within this text the term "customer driving cycle" will be used and is defined as engine 
start-up, operation of vehicle (dependent upon customer drive style) and engine shut-off. 


7 

Engine Management Systems 



FEDERAL TEST PROCEDURE (FTP) 

The Federal Test Procedure (FTP) is a specific driving cycle that is utilized by the EPA to 
test light duty vehicles and light duty truck emissions. As part of the procedure for a vehi¬ 
cle manufacturer to obtain emission certification for a particular model/engine family the 
manufacturer must demonstrate that the vehicle(s) can pass the FTP defined driving cycle 
two consecutive times while monitoring various components/systems. Some of the 
components/systems must be monitored either once per driving cycle or continuously. 

1. Components/systems required to be monitored once within one driving cycle: 

• Oxygen Sensors 

• Secondary Air Injection System 

• Catalyst Efficiency 

• Evaporative Vapor Recovery System 

NOTE: Due to the complexity involved in meeting the test criteria within the FTP defined 
driving cycle, all tests may not be completed within one "customer driving cycle". The 
test can be successfully completed within the FTP defined criteria, however customer 
driving styles may differ and therefore may not always monitor all involved compo¬ 
nents/systems in one "trip". 

Components/systems required to be monitored continuously: 

• Misfire Detection 

• Fuel system 

• Oxygen Sensors 

• All emissions related components/systems providing or getting electrical connections to 
the DME, EGS, or EML.

The diagnostic routine shown above will be discontinued whenever: 

• Engine speed exceeds 3000 RPM 

• Large fluctuations in throttle angle 

• Road speed exceeds 60 MPPI 


NOTE: The driving criteria shown can be completed within the FTP required ~11 miles in a 
controlled environment such as a dyno test or test track. 


A "customer driving cycle" may vary according to traffic patterns, route selection 
and distance traveled, which may not allow the "diagnostic trip" to be fully com¬ 
pleted each time the vehicle is operated.

OBD II FUNCTION: "CHECK ENGINE" (MIL) LIGHT 

In conjunction with the CARB/OBD II regulations the "CHECK ENGINE" light (also referred to 
as the Malfunction Indicator Light - MIL) is to be illuminated: 

• Upon the completion of the second consecutive driving cycle where the previously fault¬ 
ed system is monitored again and the emissions relevant fault is again present. 

• Immediately if a catalyst damaging fault occurs (see Misfire Detection). 

The illumination of the check engine light is performed in accordance with the Federal Test 
Procedure (FTP) which requires the lamp to be illuminated when: 

• A malfunction of a component that can affect the emission performance of the vehicle 
occurs and causes emissions to exceed 1.5 times the standards required by the (FTP). 

• Manufacturer-defined specifications are exceeded. 

• An implausible input signal is generated. 

• Catalyst deterioration causes HC-emissions to exceed a limit equivalent to 1.5 times the 
standard (FTP). 

• Misfire faults occur. 

• A leak is detected in the evaporative system 

• The oxygen sensors observe no purge flow from the purge valve/evaporative system. 

• Engine control module fails to enter closed-loop operation within a specified time interval. 

• Engine control or automatic transmission control enters a "limp home" operating mode. 

• Key is in the "ignition" on position before cranking (Bulb Check Function). 

Within the BMW system the illumination of the check engine light is performed in accor¬ 
dance with the regulations set forth in CARB mail-out 1968.1 and as demonstrated via the 
Federal Test Procedure (FTP). The following information provides several examples of when 
and how the "Check Engine" Light is illuminated based on the "customer drive cycle" (DC): 


10 

Engine Management Systems 



1. A fault code is stored within the respective control module upon the first occurrence of 
a fault in the system being checked. 

2. The "Check Engine" (MIL) light will not be illuminated until the completion of the second 
consecutive "customer driving cycle" where the previously faulted system is again mon¬ 
itored and a fault is still present or a catalyst damaging fault has occurred. 

3. If the second drive cycle was not complete and the specific function was not checked 
as shown in the example, the engine control module counts the third drive cycle as the 
“next consecutive" drive cycle. The check engine light is illuminated if the function is 
checked and the fault is still present. 

4. If there is an intermittent fault present and does not cause a fault to be set through mul¬ 
tiple drive cycles, two complete consecutive drive cycles with the fault present are 
required for the Check Engine light to be illuminated. 

5. Once the "Check Engine" light is illuminated it will remain illuminated unless the specif¬ 
ic function has been checked without fault through three complete consecutive drive 
cycles. 

6. The fault code will also be cleared from memory automatically if the specific function is 
checked through 40* consecutive drive cycles without the fault being detected or with 
the use of either the DIS, MODIC or Scan tool. 

* NOTE: In order to clear a catalyst damaging fault (see Misfire Detection) from memo¬ 
ry, the condition under which the fault occurred must be evaluated for 80 consecutive 
cycles without the fault reoccurring. 

With the use of a universal scan tool, connected to the "OBD" DLC an SAE standardized 

DTC can be obtained, along with the condition associated with the illumination of the 

"Check Engine" light. 

Using the DIS or MODIC, a fault code and the conditions associated with its setting can 

be obtained prior to the illumination of the "Check Engine" light.

OBD II DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES (DTC) 


The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) established the Diagnostic Trouble Codes used 
for OBD II systems (SAE J2012). The DTC’s are designed to be identified by their 
alpha/numeric structure. The SAE has designated the emission related DTC’s to start with 
the letter “P” for Powertrain related systems, hence their nickname “P-code”. 

For example: P 0 4 4 0 


P-Powertrain, B-Body, C-Chassis- 1 

DTC Source; 0-SAE, 1-BMW - 

System; 0-Total System- 

1 -Air/Fuel Induction 

2- Fuel Injection 

3- Ignition System or Misfire 

4- Auxiliary Emission Control 

5- Vehicle Speed & Idle Control 

6- Control Module Inputs/Outputs 

7- Transmission 

• DTC’s are stored whenever the Check Engine Light (MIL) is illuminated. 

• A requirement of CARB/EPA is providing universal diagnostic access to DTC’s via a 
standardized Diagnostic Link Connector (DLC) using a standardized tester (scan tool). 

• DTC’s only provide one set of environmental operating conditions when a fault is stored. 
This single "Freeze Frame" or snapshot refers to a block of the vehicles environmental 
conditions for a specific time when the fault first occurred. The information which is 
stored is defined by SAE and is limited in scope. This information may not even be spe¬ 
cific to the type of fault.

The table represents 
the stored information 
that would be avail¬

Scan Tool Connection (to 6/00) 


Starting with the 1995 750iL, and soon 
after on all 1996 model year BMW vehi¬ 
cles, a separate OBD II Diagnostic Link 
Connector (DLC) was added. 

The DLC provides access for an aftermar¬ 
ket scan tool to all emission related control 
systems (DME, AGS/EGS and EML). This 
diagnostic communication link uses the 
existing TXD II circuit in the vehicle through 
a separate circuit on the DLC when the 20 
pin cap is installed.

Model: E39,E46,E52,E53 

Production Date: E46 from 6/00 

E39,E52,E53 from 9/00 


For model year 2001 the E39, E46 and E53 will eliminate the 20 pin diagnostic connector 
from the engine compartment. The 16 pin OBD II connector located inside the vehicle will 
be the only diagnosis port. 


The E38 and Z3 will continue to use the 20 pin connector. 


The 16 pin OBD II connector has been in all 
BMWs since 1996 to comply with OBD II 
regulations requiring a standardized diagnostic 
port. 

Previously before 2001, only emissions relevant 
data could be extracted from the OBD II 
connector because it did not provide access to 
TXD (D-bus). The TXD line is connected to pin 
8 of the OBD II connector on vehicles without 
the 20 pin diagnostic connector. 




The cap to the OBD II connector contains a 
bridge that links KL 30 to TXD and TXD II. This 
is to protect the diagnostic circuit integrity and 
prevent erroneous faults. 

The OBD II connector is located in the drivers 
footwell to the left of the steering column of 
E39, E46 and E53 vehicles.

BMW FAULT CODE (DIS/MoDiC) 


• BMW Codes are stored as soon they occur even before the Check Engine Light (MIL) 
comes on. 

• BMW Codes are defined by BMW, Bosch, and Siemens Engineers to provide greater 
detail to fault specific information. 

• Siemens systems - (1) set of (4) fault specific environmental conditions are stored with 
the first fault occurrence. This information can change and is specific to each fault code 
to aid in diagnosing. A maximum of (10) different faults containing (4) environmental con¬ 
ditions can be stored. 

• Bosch Systems - a maximum of (4) sets of (3) fault specific environmental conditions are 
stored within each fault code. This information can change and is specific to each fault 
code to aid in diagnosing. A maximum of (10) different faults containing (3) environ¬ 
mental conditions can be stored. 

• BMW Codes also store and displays a "time stamp" when the fault last occurred. 

• A fault qualifier gives more specific detailed information about the type of fault (upper 
limit, lower limit, disconnection, plausibility, etc.). 

• BMW Fault Codes will alert the technician of the current fault status. He will be advised 
if the fault is actually still present, not currently present or intermittent. The fault specif¬ 
ic information is stored and accessible through DIS or Modic. 

• BMW Fault Codes determine the diagnostic output for BMW DIS and Modic.

SIEMENS ENGINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 


This Siemens system is designated as MS42.0. 


Siemens MS42.0 was developed to 
meet the needs of Low Emission 
Vehicle (LEV) compliancy and OBD 
II. This system also includes control 
of the Motor-driven Throttle Valve 
(MDK). 

The ECM uses a pc-board single¬ 
processor control unit in the new 
SKE housing. Mounted in the E-Box 
(next to brake master cylinder). The 
MS 42.0 ECM is flash programma¬ 
ble as seen with previous systems. 


ECM hardware includes: 



Modular plug connectors featuring 5 connectors in the SKE housing with 134 pins. 


Special features: 

• Flash EPROM which is adaptable to several 
M52 LEV engines and has the capability to 
be programmed up to 13 times 



• Connector 1 

• Connector 2 

• Connector 3 

• Connector 4 

• Connector 5 


= Supply voltages and grounds 
= Peripheral signals (oxygen sensors, CAN, etc.) 
= Engine signals 
= Vehicle signals 
= Ignition signals 


• Once a control unit is installed and coded to a vehicle it cannot be swapped with anoth¬ 
er vehicle for diagnosing or replacement (because of EWS 3.3). A new ECM must be 
installed if necessary.

SCOPE OF INPUT FUNCTIONS 
BOSCH OXYGEN SENSORS 


The MS42.0 system uses Bosch LSH 25 oxygen sensors that function basically the same 
as previously used (in Bosch systems). The voltage range is between 0 - 800 mV. 




pre 02 sensor 


post 02 sensor 


The location has changed, the pre-cat sensors are mounted on top of the exhaust mani¬ 
folds. The catalysts are now integral with the exhaust manifolds. 


PRE-CATALYST SENSORS 



19 

Engine Management Systems 




OXYGEN SENSOR SIGNAL INFLUENCE ON INJECTOR “OPEN” TIME 


The ECM monitors the: 

• Amplitude of the signal (highest voltage or range sensor is producing) 

• Switching time of the signal (how fast from lean to rich) 

• Frequency of complete cycles (how many within a period of time) 

These characteristics provide info to the ECM that reflect the overall condition of the sen¬ 
sor. 

POST CATALYTIC CONVERTER SENSOR SIGNAL 


The post catalyst 02 sensors monitor the efficiency of the catalyst as a requirement of OBD 
II. This signal also provides feedback of the pre-catalyst sensors efficiency and can cause 
the ECM to “trim” the ms injection time to correct for slight deviations. 


Bosh Systems: 

• If the catalyst is operating efficiently, most of the 
remaining oxygen in the exhaust gas is burned 
(lack of 02 - “constant lean signal”). 

The sensor signal fluctuates slightly in the higher 
end of the voltage scale. 

• If the post sensor shows excessive fluctuations 
(which echo the scope pattern of the pre sensor), 
this indicates that the catalytic converter is not 
functioning correctly and cannot consume the 02 
(fault set). 



0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5 8 


Time 



Time 


• If the post sensor fluctuations move out of the normal voltage “window”, this indicates 
that the pre sensor is not performing properly due to slight deterioration. These systems 
can also “trim” the ms injection time to compensate for this. 


The constantly changing oxygen sensor input to the ECM is needed to correct the ms 
injection time to ensure that the ideal air/fuel ratio is maintained. 


20 

Engine Management Systems 




CAMSHAFT SENSOR 

-INTAKE AND EXHAUST CAMSHAFTS 


The "static" Hall sensors are used so that the camshaft positions are recognized once igni¬ 
tion is “on” - even before the engine is started. 

The function of the intake cam sensor: 

• Cylinder bank detection for preliminary injection 

• Synchronization 

• Engine speed sensor (if crankshaft speed sensor fails) 

• Position control of the intake cam (VANOS) 

The exhaust cam sensor is used for position control of the exhaust cam (VANOS) 

If these sensors fail there are no substitute values, the system will operate in the fail-safe 
mode with no VANOS adjustment. The engine will still operate, but torque reduction will be 
noticeable. 


NOTE: Use caution on repairs as not to bend the impulse wheels 





CRANKSHAFT SENSOR 


The crankshaft sensor is a dynamic Hall-effect sensor (mounted through the engine block), 
the signal is sent the moment the crankshaft begins to rotate. 

The pulse wheel is mounted directly to the crankshaft.

MISFIRE DETECTION 


As part of the CARB/OBD regulations the engine control module must determine if misfire 
is occurring and also identify the specific cylinder(s) and the severity of the misfire event, 
and whether it is emissions relevant or catalyst damaging. In order to accomplish these 
tasks the control module monitors the crankshaft for acceleration losses during firing seg¬ 
ments of each cylinder based on firing order. 

Misfire Detection Example: M52 (6 Cyl.) with Siemens System 

The misfire/engine roughness calculation is derived from the differences in the period dura¬ 
tion (T) of individual increment gear segments. Each segment period consist of an angular 
range of 120° crank angle that starts 78° before Top Dead Center (TDC). 


Increment gear wheel segment period measurement: 
120°CA 



• If the combustion process in all cylinders is functioning correctly, the period duration of 
each segment will be identical (i.e. TO = T1 = T2 = T3 = T4 = T5). 

• If a misfire is encountered in a cylinder, the period duration (T) of that cylinder will be 
extended by a fraction of a millisecond (i.e. T3 > TO, T1, T2, T4, T5). 

• All measured values of T are evaluated within the DME, corrected based on sensor adap¬ 
tation and compared to a set of predetermined values that are dependent on engine 
speed, load and engine temperature. 

If the expected period duration is greater than the permissible value a misfire fault for the 
particular cylinder is stored in the fault memory of the DME. Depending on the level of mis¬ 
fire rate measured the control unit will illuminate the "Check Engine" light, may cut-off fuel 
to the particular cylinder and may switch lambda operation to open-loop. All misfire faults 
are weighted to determine if the misfire is emissions relevant or catalyst damaging. 


23 

Engine Management Systems 



EMISSIONS RELEVANT: 

During an interval of 1000 crankshaft revolutions the misfire events of all cylinders are 
added and if the sum is greater than a predetermined value a fault will be set identifying the 
particular cylinder(s). The Check Engine light will be illuminated during and after the sec¬ 
ond cycle if the fault is again present. 

CATALYST DAMAGING: 

During an interval of 200 crankshaft revolutions the misfire events of all cylinders are added 
and if the sum is greater than a predetermined value a fault will be set identifying the par¬ 
ticular cylinders(s). The “Check Engine” lamp: 

• On vehicles with a Siemens Control Module (M52 engines) - the lamp will immediately go 
to a steady illumination since fuel to the injector(s) is removed. Fuel cut-off to the cylin¬ 
der will resume after several (» 7) periods of decel if crankshaft sensor adaptation is suc¬ 
cessfully completed or the engine is shut-off and restarted. 

• On vehicles with a Bosch Control Module (M44, M62 & M73 engines) - the lamp will blink 
as long as the vehicle is operated within the specific criteria under which the fault 
occurred. Fuel to the misfiring cylinder is not cut-off as long as the “Check Engine” light 
is blinking. 

In each case the number of misfire events permitted is dependent on engine speed, load 
and temperature map. 

The process of misfire detection continues well after the diagnostic drive cycle requirements 
have been completed. Misfire detection is an on-going monitoring process that is only dis¬ 
continued under certain conditions. 


Misfire detection is only disabled under the following conditions:

SCOPE OF OUTPUT FUNCTIONS 
VANOS CONTROL 

With the introduction of double VANOS, the valve timing is changed on both the intake and 
the exhaust camshafts. 

Double VANOS provides the following benefits: 

• Torque increase in the low to mid (1500 - 2000 RPM) range without power loss in the 
upper RPM range. 

• Less incomplete combustion when idling due to less camshaft overlap (also improves 
idle speed characteristics). 

• Internal exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in the part load range (reduces NOx and post¬ 
combustion of residual gasses in the exhaust) 

• Rapid catalyst warm up and lower “raw” emissions after cold start. 

• Reduction in fuel consumption 

Double VANOS consists of the following parts: 

• Intake and exhaust camshafts with helical gear insert 

• Sprockets with adjustable gears 

• VANOS actuators for each camshaft 

• 2 three-way solenoid switching valves 

• 2 impulse wheels for detecting camshaft position 

• 2 camshaft position sensors (Hall effect) 

The “initial” timing is set by gear positioning (refer to the Repair Instructions for details) and 
the chain tensioner. As with the previous VANOS, the hydraulically controlled actuators 
move the helical geared cups to regulate camshaft timing. The angled teeth of the helical 
gears cause the pushing movement of the helical cup to be converted into a rotational 
movement. This rotational movement is added to the turning of the camshafts and cause 
the camshafts to “advance” or “retard”. The adjustment rate is dependent oil temperature, 
oil pressure, and engine RPM. 


27 

Engine Management Systems 




NOTE: With extremely hot oil temperatures Vanos is deactivated (Powerloss). If the oil is 
too thick (wrong viscosity) a fault could be set. 

When the engine is started, the camshafts are in the “fail-safe” position (deactivated). The 
intake camshaft is in the RETARDED position - held by oil pressure from the sprung open 
solenoid. The exhaust camshaft is in the ADVANCED position - held by a preload spring in 
the actuator and oil pressure from the sprung open solenoid. 

After 50 RPM (2-5 seconds) from engine start, the ECM is monitoring the exact camshaft 
position. 

The ECM positions the camshafts based on engine RPM and the throttle position signal. 
From that point the camshaft timing will be varied based on intake air and coolant temper¬ 
atures. 

The double VANOS system is “fully variable”. When the ECM detects the camshafts are in 
the optimum positions, the solenoids are modulated (approximately 100-220 Hz) maintain¬ 
ing oil pressure on both sides of the actuators to hold the camshaft timing. 

CAUTION: The VANOS MUST be removed and installed exactly as described in the Repair 
Instructions! 

NOTE: If the VANOS camshaft system goes to the fail-safe mode (deactivated) there will 
be a noticeable loss of power. This will be like driving with retarded ignition or starting from 
a stop in third gear.

The dual VANOS in conjunction with the variable intake manifold provides an additional 
emission control feature. 

Because of the improved combustion, the camshaft timing is adjusted for more overlap. 
The increased overlap supports internal exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) which reduces 
tailpipe emissions and lowers fuel consumption. 

During the part load engine range, the intake camshaft overlap opens the intake valve. This 
allows limited exhaust gas reflow the intake manifold. 

The “internal” EGR reduces the cylinder temperature thus lowering NOx. This feature pro¬ 
vides EGR without the external hardware as seen on previous systems.

ELECTRIC FAN 

The electric cooling fan is controlled by the ECM. The ECM uses a remote power output 
final stage (mounted on the fan housing) 

The power output stage receives power from a 50 amp fuse (located in glove box above 
the fuse bracket). The electric fan is controlled by a pulse width modulated signal from the 
ECM. 

The fan is activated based on the ECM calculation (sensing ratio) of: 

• Coolant outlet temperature 

• Calculated (by the ECM) catalyst temperature 

• Vehicle speed 

• Battery voltage 

• Air Conditioning pressure (calculated by IHKA 
and sent via the K-Bus to the ECM) 


Activation of the electric fan: 

When the vehicle is first started the fan is activated briefly (20% of maximum speed), then 
it is switched off. This procedure is performed for diagnostic purposes. 

The voltage generated by the fan when it slows down (it becomes a generator at this time) 
must meet the power output stages programmed criteria. This will confirm the RPM of the 
fan, if this is not met the signal wire from the output stage is switched to ground and a fault 
is set in memory. 

NOTE: If the ECM indicates a fault check the fan for freedom of movement 

After the initial test has been performed, the fan is brought up to the specified operating 
speed. At 10% (sensing ratio) the fan runs at 1/3 speed. At a sensing ratio of between 90- 
95% the fan is running at maximum speed. Below 10% or above 95% the fan is stationary. 

The sensing ratio is suppressed by a hysteresis function, this prevents speed fluctuation. 
When the A/C is switched on, the electric fan is not immediately activated. 

After the engine is switched off, the fan may continue to operate at varying speeds (based 
on the ECM calculated catalyst temperature). This will cool the radiator down form a heat 
surge (up to 10 minutes).

The fuel circuit changeover (run¬

operation from the previous sys¬ 
tem. The attached fuel pressure 
regulator no longer controls fuel 
pressure influenced by vacuum 
supply. 

The ECM now determines the fuel 
quantity compensation for mani¬ 
fold vacuum changes. This is 
based on throttle position sensor, 
air mass meter, load, etc. for pre¬ 
cise compensation.

SECONDARY AIR INJECTION 

This ECM controlled function remains unchanged from 
the previous Siemens MS 41.1 system, however there 
is a hardware change. 

The Air Injection Inlet Valve mounts directly to the cylin¬ 
der head, with a passageway machined through the 
head. This eliminates the external Air Injection manifold 
distribution pipes to the exhaust manifolds. 



SECONDARY AIR INJECTION MONITORING 

In order to reduce HC and CO emissions while the engine is warming up, BMW imple¬ 
mented the use of a Secondary Air Injection System. Immediately following a cold engine 
start (-10 - 40°C) fresh air/oxygen is injected directly into the exhaust manifold. By inject¬ 
ing oxygen into the exhaust manifold: 

• The warm up time of the catalyst is reduced 

• Oxidation of the hydrocarbons is accelerated 

The activation period of the air pump can vary depending on engine type and operating 
conditions.

33 

Engine Management Systems 














The Secondary Air Injection System is monitored via the use of the pre-catalyst oxygen sen¬ 
sors). Once the air pump is active and is air injected into the system the signal at the oxy¬ 
gen sensor will reflect a lean condition. If the oxygen sensor signal does not change with¬ 
in a predefined time a fault will be set and identify the faulty bank(s). If after completing the 
next cold start and a fault is again present the "Check Engine" light will be illuminated. 

Example: Secondary Air Injection Monitoring (Siemens System) 

During a cold start condition air is immediately injected into the exhaust manifold and since 
the oxygen sensors are in open loop at this time the voltage at the pre catalyst sensor will 
reflect a lean condition) and will remain at this level while the air pump is in operation. Once 
the pump is deactivated the voltage will change to a rich condition until the system goes 
into closed loop operation. 

System Operation: 

The pump draws air through its own air filter and delivers it to both exhaust manifolds 
through a non-return (shutoff valve). The non-return valve is used to: 

1. Control air injection into the exhaust manifold - A vacuum controlled valve will open the 
passageway for air to be injected once a vacuum is applied. 

2. Prevent possible backfires from traveling up the pipes and damaging the air pump when 
no vacuum is applied. 

The control module activates the vacuum vent valve whenever the air pump is energized. 
Once the vacuum vent valve is energized a vacuum is applied to the non-return valve which 
allows air to be injected into the exhaust manifold. A vacuum is retained in the lines, by the 
use of a check valve, in order to allow the non-return valve to be immediately activated on 
cold engine start up. When the vacuum/vent valve is not energized, the vacuum to the 
non-return valve is removed and is vented to atmosphere.

FUEL INJECTOR VALVES 


The fuel injectors which are supplied by Siemens 
Inject at an angle (dual cone spray pattern). The tip 
of the injector is fitted with a directional angle "plate" 
with dual outlets. The lower portion of the injector 
body is now jacketed in metal. The ECM control of 
the injectors remains unchanged from the previous 
Siemens MS41.1 system. 


ENGINE/VEHICLE SPEED 
LIMITATION 

For engine/vehicle speed limitation, the ECM will 
deactivate injection for individual cylinders, allowing 
a smoother limitation transition. This prevents over¬ 
rev when the engine reaches maximum RPM (under 
acceleration), and limits top vehicle speed (approx. 
128 mph).

RZV IGNITION SYSTEM 


The Siemens MS42.0 system uses a multiple spark ignition function. The purpose of mul¬ 
tiple ignition is: 


• Provide clean burning during engine start up and while idling (reducing emissions). 


• This function helps to keep the spark plugs clean for longer service life (new BMW 
longlife plugs). 



Multiple ignition is active up to an engine speed of approximately 1350 RPM (varied with 
engine temperature) and up to 20 degrees after TDC. 


Multiple ignition is dependent on battery voltage. 
When the voltage is low, the primary current is 
also lower and a longer period of time is required 
to build up the magnetic field in the coil(s). 


• Low battery voltage = less multiple ignitions 

• High battery voltage = more multiple ignitions 


The 240 ohm shunt resistor is still used on the 
MS42.0 system for detecting secondary ignition 
faults and diagnostic purposes.

RESONANCE/TURBULENCE INTAKE SYSTEM 


On the M52 TU, the intake manifold is split into 2 groups of 3 (runners) which increases low 
end torque. The intake manifold also has separate (internal) turbulence bores which chan¬ 
nels air from the idle speed actuator directly to one intake valve of each cylinder (matching 
bore of 5.5mm in the cylinder head). 

Routing the intake air to only one intake valve causes the intake to swirl in the cylinder. 
Together with the high flow rate of the intake air due to the small intake cross sections, this 
results in a reduction in fluctuations and more stable combustion.

RESONANCE SYSTEM 


The resonance system provides increased engine torque at low RPM, as well as addition¬ 
al power at high RPM. Both of these features are obtained by using a resonance flap (in 
the intake manifold) controlled by the ECM. 

During the low to mid range rpm, the resonance flap is closed. This produces a long/sin¬ 
gle intake tube for velocity, which increases engine torque. 

During mid range to high rpm, the resonance flap is open. This allows the intake air to pull 
through both resonance tubes, providing the air volume necessary for additional power at 
the upper RPM range. 

When the flap is closed , this creates another “dynamic” effect. For example, as the intake 
air is flowing into cylinder #1, the intake valves will close. This creates a “roadblock” for the 
in rushing air. The air flow will stop and expand back (resonance wave back pulse) with the 
in rushing air to cylinder #5. The resonance “wave”, along with the intake velocity, 
enhances cylinder filling. 

The ECM controls a solenoid valve for resonance flap activation. At speeds below 3750 
RPM, the solenoid valve is energized and vacuum supplied from an accumulator closes 
the resonance flap. This channels the intake air through one resonance tube, but increas¬ 
es the intake velocity. 

When the engine speed is greater than 4100 RPM (which varies slightly - temperature influ¬ 
enced), the solenoid is de-energized. The resonance flap is sprung open, allowing flow 
through both resonance tubes, increasing volume.

IDLE SPEED CONTROL 


The ECM determines idle speed by controlling an idle speed actuator (dual winding rotary

The basic functions of the idle speed control are: 


• Control the initial air quantity 
(at air temperatures <0 C, 
the MDK is simultaneously 
opened) 

• Variable preset idle based on 
load and inputs 

• Monitor RPM feedback for 
each preset position 

• Lower RPM range intake air 
flow (even while driving) 

• Vacuum limitation

• Smooth out the transition from acceleration to deceleration 


Idle speeds will vary (idle speed stabilization): 

• During the warm up phase • When Air conditioning is activated 

• When a drive gear is selected • When heating the passenger compartment 

• At all electric fan speeds • If nominal RPM is modified (idle speed increase) by 

DIS service function (if applicable) 

Emergency Operation of Idle Speed Actuator: 

If a fault is detected with the idle speed actuator, the ECM will initiate fail-safe measures 
depending on the effect of the fault (increased air flow or decreased air flow). 

If there is a fault in the idle speed actuator/circuit, the MDK will compensate to maintain idle 
speed. The EML lamp will be illuminated to inform the driver of a fault. 

If the fault causes increased air flow (actuator failed open), VANOS and Knock Control are 
deactivated which noticeably reduces engine performance.

CRUISE CONTROL 


Cruise control is integrated into the ECM because of the MDK operation. 

Cruise control functions are activated directly by the multifunction steering wheel to the 
ECM. The individual buttons are digitally encoded in the MFL switch and is input to the ECM 
over a serial data wire. 

MFL 



INSTRUMENT CLUSTER 


The ECM controls vehicle speed by activation of the Motor Driven Throttle Valve (MDK) 

The clutch switch disengages cruise control to prevent over-rev during gear changes. 

The brake light switch and the brake light test switch are input to the ECM to disengage 
cruise control as well as fault recognition during engine operation of the MDK. 

Road speed is input to the ECM for cruise control as well as ASC/MSR regulation. The vehi¬ 
cle speed signal for normal engine operation is supplied from the ABS module (right rear 
wheel speed sensor). The road speed signal for cruise control is supplied from the ABS 
module. This is an average taken from both front wheel speed sensors, supplied via the 
CAN bus.

INTAKE (VACUUM) JET PUMP 


The intake jet pump function is controlled by the MS42 ECM. The purpose is to provide suf¬ 
ficient vacuum for the brake booster in all operating conditions. 

The additional vacuum compensation is activated by the ECM when the idle speed actua¬ 
tor is regulated for: 

• A/C compressor "ON" 

• Drive gear engaged (if the transmissions in fail-safe, the jet pump will always be operat¬ 
ing) 

• Engine warm up <70°C 

The ECM controls the Intake Jet Pump by activating the Solenoid Control Valve. Additional 
Vacuum Enhancement is applied to the brake booster when the control circuit is "deacti¬ 
vated" (solenoid sprung open). Vacuum Enhancement is limited to the brake booster when 
the control circuit is "activated" (solenoid powered closed).

PURGE VALVE 


The purge valve (TEV) is activated at 10 Hz by the ECM to cycle open, and is sprung

TORQUE INTERFACES 


If torque reduction or increase is required for ASC/DSC/MSR/AGS, the ECM will regulate 
engine power in the following manner: 

• If less torque is required, the ignition timing is reduced (fast intervention), the idle speed 
actuator and MDK reduce intake air. 

• If increased torque is required (MSR), the idle speed actuator and MDK increase intake 
air. 

The data required for engine torque manipulation is relayed via the CAN bus.

LEAKAGE DIAGNOSIS PUMP (LDP) 


The location of the LDP and charcoal canister have changed. This combination assembly 
is located under the right rear trunk floor. 


EVAPORATIVE FUEL SYSTEM PRESSURE LEAK DIAGNOSIS MS42.0 

The LDP is capable of detecting a leak as small as 0.5 mm. 

The LDP is a unitized component that contains the following: 

• Vacuum chamber 

• Pneumatic pump chamber 

• DME activated vacuum solenoid 

• Reed switch providing a switched voltage feedback signal to the DME 

The LDP assembly is only replaceable as a complete unitized component, however, it is 
separate from the charcoal canister. 



46 

Engine Management Systems 


LDP OPERATION 


During every engine cold start, the following occurs: 


• The LDP solenoid is energized by the ECM 


• Engine manifold vacuum enters the upper chamber of the LDP to lift up the spring 
loaded diaphragm pulling ambient air through the filter and into the lower chamber of 



• The solenoid is then de-energized, spring pressure closes the vacuum port blocking the 
engine vacuum and simultaneously opens the vent port to the balance tube which 
releases the captive vacuum in the upper chamber. 

• This allows the compressed spring to push the diaphragm down, starting the “limited 
down stroke”. 

47 

Engine Management Systems 



































































































































































• The air that was drawn into the lower chamber of the LDP during the upstroke is forced 
out of the lower chamber and into the evaporative system. 

• This electrically controlled repetitive up/down stroke is cycled repeatedly building up a 
total pressure of approximately +25mb in the evaporative system. 



• After sufficient pressure has built up (LDP and its cycling is calibrated to the vehicle), the 
leak diagnosis begins and lasts about 100 seconds. 

• The upper chamber contains an integrated reed switch that produces a switched high- 
low voltage signal that is monitored by the ECM. The switch is opened by the magnetic 
interruption of the metal rod connected to the diaphragm when in the diaphragm is in 
the top dead center position. 

• The repetitive up/down stroke is confirmation to the ECM that the valve is functioning.

The ECM also monitors the length of time it takes for the reed switch to open, which is 
opposed by pressure under the diaphragm in the lower chamber. The LDP is still cycled, 
but at a frequency that depends upon the rate of pressure loss in the lower chamber. 

• If the pumping frequency is below parameters, there is no leak present. 

• If the pumping frequency is above parameters, this indicates sufficient pressure can not 
build up in the lower chamber and evaporative system, indicating a leak. 



A fault code can be recorded by each ECM indicating an evaporative system leak. Upon 
test completion, the ECM releases the ground path to the LDP and the internal spring push¬ 
es the diaphragm for the “full down stroke”. 

At bottom dead center, the diaphragm rod opens the canister vent valve. This allows for 
fresh air intake from the filter for normal purge system operation. 

The LDP is diagnosable with the DIS including a service function activation test.

TIME (seconds) 


• On cold engine start up, the pump is activated for the first 27 seconds at 
approximately 1.6 - 2.0 Hz. This pumping phase is required to pressurize the 
evaporative components. 

• Once pressurized, the build up phase then continues from 27-38 seconds. The ECM 
monitors the system through the reed switch to verify that pressure has stabilized. 

• The measuring phase for leak diagnosis lasts from 38-63 seconds. The pump is acti¬ 
vated but due to the pressure build up under the diaphragm, the pump moves slower. 
If the pump moves quickly, this indicates a lack of pressure or a leak. This registers as 
a fault in the ECM’s. 

• From 63-100 seconds the pump is deactivated, allowing full down stroke of the 
diaphragm and rod. At the extreme bottom of rod travel, the canister vent valve is 
pushed open relieving pressure and allowing normal purge operation when needed.

MOTOR DRIVEN THROTTLE VALVE 


The MDK control function 
has been integrated into the 
ECM. The purpose is for pre¬ 
cision throttle operation, 
OBD II compliant for fault 
monitoring, ASC/MSR con¬ 
trol, and cruise control. This 
integration reduces extra 
control modules, wiring, and 
sensors. 



The MDK control function is integrated into the Siemens MS42.0 ECM. The ECM carries 
this function out by regulating the engine throttle valve. 

The engine throttle valve performs the following functions: 

• Precision intake air control 

• ASC control 

• MSR control 

• Cruise control 

• Preset position during engine start up (if temperature is < 0°C) 

The new engine throttle valve (MDK) differs from the familiar EML in the following points: 

• The accelerator pedal potentiometer (PWG) is now integrated in the MDK housing. 

• A throttle cable is used to actuate the throttle potentiometers and also serves as a back¬ 
up to open the throttle plate (full control) if the MDK system is in fail-safe.

c 

The throttle cable (foot pedal controlled) is connected to a pulley on the side of the MDK/ 
The pulley is linked by springs to one end of the throttle shaft, the MDK electric motor is 
attached to the other end of the throttle shaft. 

With the pulley linked by springs to the throttle shaft, this allows ASC intervention to over¬ 
ride the driver’s set throttle position. 

As the pulley and shaft are rotated, the twin potentiometers (integral in the MDK housing, 
driver’s wish) are sensing the requested load. A twin potentiometer is used for back up 
redundancy (fail-safe). 

The MS42.0 ECM will actuate the MDK motor pulse width modulated in both directions at 
a basic frequency of 600 Hz) which positions the throttle plate. 

The second twin potentiometers feedback the actual throttle plate position, allowing the 
ECM to verify correct throttle position. Again, twin potentiometers are used for back up

MDK EMERGENCY OPERATION 


If a fault is detected in the system, the following modes of operation are: 

• Emergency operation 1 - Faults which do not impair safety, but which adversely affect 
the functioning of the MDK. 

• Emergency operation 2 - Applies when faults are encountered which might impair safe 
driving operation. 

• Emergency operation of idle speed actuator. 


EMERGENCY OPERATION 1 

• Activation of the EML warning lamp. 

• MDK is deactivated, the throttle valve is opened mechanically by the springs and throt¬ 
tle cable. 

• To maintain vehicle control, the MDK opening is compensated for by closing the idle 
speed actuator and retarding the ignition (engine power reduction). 

• Engine power is further limited by fuel injector cutout. 

Emergency operation 1 limits the dynamic operation if one or more of the potentiometers 
fail. The engine can slowly reach maximum speed with limited power. The EML light will 
be illuminated to alert the driver of a fault. 


EMERGENCY OPERATION 2 

If another fault is encountered in addition to emergency operation 1 or if the plausibility is 
affected, emergency operation 2 is activated by the ECM. 

An example of plausibility fault would be that the pulley position does not match the MDK 
position and the associated airflow. 

Emergency operation 2 can also be initiated by simultaneously pressing both the acceler¬ 
ator pedal and the brake pedal, or if a fault is encountered in the brake light switch diag¬ 
nosis.

Engine Management Systems 



When in emergency 2 operation mode, there is an engine speed limitation (slightly above 
idle speed) in addition to the measures for emergency operation 1. 

In emergency operation 2, the engine speed is always limited to 1300 RPM if the brake is 
not applied, and approximately 1000 RPM if the brake is applied. 

The vehicle speed is limited to approximately 20-25 mph. The reason for limiting the vehi¬ 
cle speed is if the MDK is wide open, the vacuum assist is insufficient for the brakes. 

The emergency operation functions are inactive when: 

• Ignition is switched off, main relay is deactivated, and engine is started again 

• A fault is not detected 

• Brake pedal is not depressed 

• The throttle valve is in the idle speed setting 


FURTHER SAFETY CONCEPTS 

The MDK safety concept can detect a jammed or binding throttle valve as well as a bro¬ 
ken link spring. This fault is detected by the ECM monitoring the feedback potentiometers 
from the MDK in relation to the pulse width modulation to activate the MDK motor. 

Emergency operation functions if the throttle valve is jammed: 

• Engine speed limitation depending on driver’s wish potentiometers and the MDK posi¬ 
tion. 

• Limited vehicle speed if MDK is wide open. 

• The ECM will alternate between 0 - 100% sensing ratio to “shake” the MDK loose. 

In the event of a fault, the DIS or MODIC must be used to interrogate the fault memory, and 
clear the fault once the proper repair has been performed.

INTAKE AIR FLOW CONTROL 

Under certain engine parameters, the MDK throttle control and the idle speed actuator 
(ZWD) are operated simultaneously. 

The ECM detects the driver’s wish from the twin potentiometers monitoring the cable/pul- 
ley position. 

This value is added to the idle speed control value and the total is what the ECM uses for 
MDK activation. The ECM then controls the idle speed actuator to satisfy the idle air “fill”, 
in addition, the MDK will also be activated = pre-control idle air charge. Both of these 
functions are utilized to maintain idle RPM. 

The MDK is electrically held at the idle speed position, and all of the intake air is drawn 
through the idle speed actuator. Without a load placed on the engine (<15% load), the 
MDK will not open until the extreme upper RPM range. 

If the engine is under load (>15%), the idle speed actuator is open and the MDK will also 
open. 

In the upper PWG range (approximately >60%), the MDK is switched off. The throttle 
valve is opened wider exclusively by the pulley via the spring linkage. 

At the full throttle position, “kickdown” is obtained by depressing the accelerator pedal 
fully. This will overwind the pulley, but the spring linkage will not move the throttle plate 
past 90 degrees of rotation. 


NOTE: If the MDK is defective, it is replaced as a unit and is not internally serviceable.
