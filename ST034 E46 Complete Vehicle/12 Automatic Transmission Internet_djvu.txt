COMPONENTS 


Transmission Cases and Pan: 

Made of aluminum alloy, the cases are light weight. The single piece oil pan is made of sin¬ 
gle wall sheet metal. It includes a drain plug on the bottom surface at the rear.

The oil pan is mounted to the main case by 20 bolts. Oil pan sealing integrity is ensured 
by a controlled compression gasket. Cross tightening is required to ensure an even seal. 
Final torque of pan bolts is 10-12 Nm. 


Torque Converter: 


The 4 element torque converter consists of the Turbine, Rotor, 
Stator with one way clutch and Lock up clutch. Similar in 
function to previous torque converters, this unit’s lock up 
clutch is: 

• Fully disengaged 

• Variable engagement providing precise slippage, 

• Fully engaged (locked) 

The various clutch application hydraulic pressures are regulat¬ 
ed by the control module activated torque converter lock up 
solenoid. 

The torque converter is manufactured specifically for the 
model it is installed in and is part number specific.

Automatic Transmissions 





Vane Pump: 

The A5S 360R uses a vane pump to provide the transmission main line oil supply for opera¬ 
tion and cooling requirements. The pump rotor is mechanically driven by the torque convert¬ 
er oil pump drive tangs at 1:1 engine speed rotation providing pump operation. 


The rotor with 13 vanes is located in a recess on 
the rear surface of the bell housing covered by the 
pump cover plate. The rotor and vanes are 
placed inside a slide mechanism. As the rotor 
spins, the vanes “sweep” the oil from the pump 
intake to the output along the mating surface of 
the vane ends and the interior surface of the slide. 

The slide is mounted on a pivot pin. As it pivots, it 
changes the eccentricity of the rotor to slide mating 
surface changing the pump output volume. 

The slide’s position is influenced by a calibrated 
spring and hydraulic input pressure from the main 
pressure regulator solenoid in the valve body. 

The benefit of changing the slide position is to optimize pump output volume to meet the 

needs of the operating conditions. 

• Max volume during 
engine startup. This 
condition provides a 
fast priming action 
of the pump for 
immediate lubrica¬ 
tion and hydraulic 
pressure for opera¬ 
tion. 

• Regulated output 
volume for varied 
driving conditions. 

Maximum volume is 
not required at all 
times. 


The GS 20 regulates the pump output volume as well as main line pressure regulation

Electro/Hydraulic Valve Body: 


Located in the oil sump, the valve body is the electro/hydraulic control center for regulating 

and distributing pressurized transmission fluid for activating the various clutches, torque 

converter variable lock up, and regulation of main line oil pressures. 

Sub components of the valve body assembly include: 

• Manual valve 

• One main pressure regulator solenoid (Pressure Regulator Force Motor Solenoid - "GM 
term") 

• One torque converter regulator solenoid (also serves the Reverse Lock out function) 

• Three MV shift solenoids (When activated in a coded sequence provide shifts for 1 -2,2- 
3,3-4,4-5) 

• The spool valves and springs for controlling apply pressures, activating shifts, regulat¬ 
ing torque converter lock up, etc. 

• Four accumulator chambers for "cushioning" the transmission fluid apply pressure dur¬ 
ing upshifts 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5.

Accumulator Chambers: 


The accumulator chambers are similar in function to "fluid dampers". The accumulators are 
used to improve shift quality by absorbing apply pressures on the multiplate clutches pro¬ 
viding a cushioned clutch engagement. 



Clutch apply fluid pressure 
directed to an accumulator 
piston and helped by a 
spring force opposes an p^ofpuMP^ 
accumulator fluid line pres¬ 
sure creating an action 
similar to a shock 
absorber. 

The apply pressure pushes the clutch piston 
against the steel/friction plates causing ini¬ 
tial engagement. 



Once the clearance between the clutch plates is taken up by the piston travel and the 
plates begin complete engagement the fluid pressure builds very rapidly. 


The accumulator is connected to the clutch 

apply circuit which at this 

point starts to absorb the line pressure ^. r 

.... .. .. FROM OIL PUMP 

rapidly building pressure. 

The accumulator piston 
moves upward accommo¬ 
dating the high pressure 
fluid causing a delayed 
complete engagement.

Multi plate Drive and Brake Clutches: 


Located in the main case are four drive 
and five brake clutches. When cush¬ 
ioned hydraulic control pressure is 
applied, the clutches engage smoothly 
with a slight delay. 

The valve body activates the various 
drive and brake clutches in a coded 
sequence to transmit engine drive 
torque to the planetary gear set provid¬ 
ing the various output shaft ratios. 

The clutches are multiplate units with 
both steel and friction plates. The fric¬ 
tion plates are single sided.

Free Wheel Clutches (Sprag Type) 

Free wheel clutches spin freely in one 
direction and lock in the opposite 
direction. 

They consist of an inner race, an 
outer race and the sprag assembly. 

The sprag assembly contains individ¬ 
ual, asymmetrically shaped wedges 
(sprags). 

• When the inner race is driven, the 
sprags allow free wheel rotation. 
There is no effect on the outer 
race. 



• When the outer race is driven, the 
sprags wedge between the inner 
and outer races causing them to 
lock. The inner race is then driven 
by the outer race. 

Free wheel clutches are used to: 

• hold components stationary, 

• drive components when driven 

• free wheel, allowing power to spin 
the inner or outer race without an 
output reaction. 


(OUTER RACE) 
SPRAG RACE ASSEMBLY 



The A5S 360R utilizes four Free Wheel clutches to perform various shifting and component 
holding functions during the delayed, cushioned multi plate clutch engagement preventing 
an interruption in the power flow during upshifts. 


The clutches are identified as FW1, FW2, FW3 and FW4.

Planetary Gearset (Ravigneaux) 

Based on the Ravigneaux design, the A5S 360R planetary gearset is made up of two sec 
tions; front & rear. It functions as a single integral assembly with a common planetary car 
rier and a set of common long planetary gears. It consists of the following components: 

• Two separate ring gears, 

• Two separate input sun gears (one front, one rear) 

• One set of three long planetary gears common to both sections (front-rear). 

• One set of three short planetary gears (rear) 

• One set of three short planetary gears (front) 

• One common planetary carrier. 

The gearset has three possible torque inputs: 

1. Planetary carrier 

2. Front input sun gear 

3. Rear input sun gear 

Three possible reaction components: 

1. Planetary carrier 

2. Front ring gear 

3. Front input sun gear 

and one torque output: 

1. Rear ring gear.

Transmission Fluid Heat Exchanger: 



A transmission fluid heat exchanger is 
located on the bottom edge of the radia¬ 
tor. 

Transmission fluid inlet and outlet hose 
fittings are located on the driver’s side of 
the transmission. 

The heat exchanger provides two func¬ 
tions: 


• After initial start up, the transmission 
fluid is warmed up by the engine 
coolant as it passes through the heat 
exchanger. The heat exchanger is 
controlled by an integral thermostat 
which regulates the transmission fluid 
flow into the radiator exchanger. In 
this state the heat exchanger acts as 
a transmission oil heater. 


• During operation at higher temperatures, the hot transmission fluid loses heat to the 
engine coolant when it passes through the heat exchanger and into the core of the radi¬ 
ator.

Automatic Transmissions 


A5S 360R POWER FLOW 


The GS 20 module controls the hydraulic valve body through electrical activation of the var¬ 
ious solenoids. Electrical activation is based on a programmed operation map and trans¬ 
mission operating conditions (vehicle speed, engine load, throttle position, range selection, 
AGS program logic, etc). 

Engine torque is transferred by the various drive clutches when activated. The various 
torque paths enter the planetary gearset as input. Simultaneously, the planetary gearset 
is provided with reactionary input (held components) from the various brake clutches and 
Free Wheel clutches. 

The output result is five forward drive gears with progressive ratios and a single reverse 
gear.

TRANSMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM (GS 20) 


The A5S 360R automatic transmission is 
controlled by the GS 20 control module. 
The acronym (GS) comes from the German 
word "Getriebesteurung ", meaning 
Gearbox Control. 

The design, program development and 
manufacturing of the GS 20 control system 
is the result of the combined efforts of 
BMW, Siemens and GM. 

The GS 20 control module is located in the 
E box in the engine compartment. It utilizes 
the 134 pin, "SKE" (standard shell con¬ 
struction), modular connector, enclosure.

GS 20 INPUT SIGNALS 


Power Supply and Grounds: 

The GS 20 receives: 

• KL 30 (constant battery power), 

• KL 15 (terminal 15 of the ignition switch) 

• KL 87 (operating power from the Engine Control Main Relay) 

• KL 31 (ground connection for the control module electronics and peripheral component 
operation) 

The GS 20 monitors the power/ground inputs for shorts (B+ and B-), open circuits and bat¬ 
tery voltage levels (high and low). 


Range Selector Switch: 

The switch is mounted inside the transmission main case on the dri¬ 
ver’s side. This location provides precise monitoring of the Manual 
valve position and is sheltered from the harsh environment under the 
vehicle external of the main case. Adjustment is not required. 

The range selector switch has 6 wires. The GS 20 provides the switch with 12 volts on one 
wire (pin 2 of connector X70004). 


Depending on the range selector posi¬ 
tion, the switch provides coded high 
signals over five wires to the GS 20. 
The addition of the fifth wire (pin 1) is 
new compared with previous four wire 
range selectors providing a redundant 
P/N signal circuit.

Electronic Brake and Brake Test Switch: 

The GS 20 monitors the brake pedal position to activate sport mode, down hill recognition 
and for the shift lock operation. The control module receives both the brake and brake test 
hall effect sensor signals. When pressed; 

• the brake light switch pulls a standing voltage in the GS 20 low, 

• the brake test switch provides a high signal to a circuit monitor in the GS 20. 

18 

Automatic Transmissions 




Kick Down Switch: 

When the throttle pedal is pressed fully to 
the floor, the kick down switch closes pro¬ 
viding a ground signal to the GS 20. 

The GS 20 recognizes the ground as a 
request to provide an immediate down shift 
and to switch to the AGS sport mode shift¬ 
ing program. 

Transmission Fluid Temperature Sensor: 

Located in the transmission oil sump, the NTC oil temperature sensor’s 
ohmic value decreases as the temperature increases. The GS 20 monitors 
the fluid temperature by sensing the voltage drop across the sensor caus¬ 
ing a standing monitor voltage to "bleed" to ground. Rise and fall of the 
standing voltage value is a direct correlation of the fluid temperature. 

Detection of high fluid temperature modifies the torque converter regulation control and 
modifies the shift program to aid in reducing transmission fluid temperature. 

If the signal becomes impaired, the GS 20 applies a substitute temperature value based on 
Engine Temperature via CAN and stores a specific fault code. 

Transmission Input and Output Speed Sensors: 

The transmission speed sensors (turbine and output shaft) are analog induc¬ 
tive sensors that produce an AC sine wave similar to an ABS/ASC wheel 
speed sensor. The AC signal frequency is proportional to the rotation speed 
of the monitored components . 

• The turbine speed sensor scans a pulse wheel attached to the forward clutch housing. 

• The output shaft speed sensor scans a pulse wheel attached to the rear ring gear. 

The GS 20 monitors these signals along with the engine speed signal (CAN) to calculate 
transmission slip ratio for plausibility and for the adaptive pressure control function. 

The sensors are monitored for plausible signals, opens and shorts. Specific fault codes are 
stored for defects with these sensors. 





19 


Automatic Transmissions 



GS 20 OUTPUT CONTROL SIGNALS 


Valve Body Solenoid and Pressure Regulator Control 



The GS 20 activates the 3 shift solenoids by individual switched 
ground output control signals. 



The Main Oil Pressure and Torque Converter Lock up regulators are 
controlled by a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) control to ground. 

PWM control modulates the hydraulic control pressures based on the 
current AGS shift program and maintains adaptive pressure control. 


Shift Lock Solenoid Control: 


The shift lock feature prevents the uninten¬ 
tional movement of the shifter from Park or 
Neutral. 

When KL 15 is switched on, the shift lock is 
engaged, when the brake pedal is pressed, 
the GS 20 releases the ground control cir¬ 
cuit of the shift lock solenoid unlocking the 
shift gate. Additionally, above 2500 RPM, 
the selector lever remains locked in Park 
even if the brake pedal is applied. 



P/N Signal: 


As an output function, the GS 20 provides the EWS 3.3 with a switched high/low signal for 
P/N status. 


• p or N = high 

• all other ranges = low. 

The EWS 3.3 provides the P/N safety feature preventing the starter motor from operating 
unless the shifter is in P/N (high signal). 

Back Up Light Relay Control: 

As an output function, the GS 20 provides a switched ground to activate the control circuit 
of the back up light relay when the range selector is in R. The Back Up Light Relay pro¬ 
vides power directly to the back up lights. The lighting circuit is also used as a high signal 
indicating Reverse status for PDC, NAV and the electro chromatic rearview mirror systems. 

20 

Automatic Transmissions 



CAN BUS COMMUNICATION: 


The E46 utilizes the now familiar “twisted pair” CAN bus wiring configuration for drivetrain 
and instrument cluster communication interface. The MS 42.0 to GS 20 link is a dedi¬ 
cated CAN circuit. The MS 42.0 is the gateway for data exchange between the GS 20 and 
Mark 20 El (traction control) and the Instrument cluster. 


INSTRUMENT 
CLUSTER 



CAN bus data exchange for the GS 20 
includes: 

• Engine Speed (input), 

• Engine Temperature (input), 

• Accelerator pedal position and 
application (input), 

• Engine intervention signalling (input and 
output) 

• Shift delay for traction control and warm 
up phase (input) 

• Active shift program (output) 

• Cruise control requirements (input) 

• Turn recognition (input) 

• Current Range and program selection (output) 

• Torque Converter lock up signalling (output) 

• Transmission fault indication lamp (output) 

• etc..

GS 20 Program Features Overview 

AGS (ADAPTIVE TRANSMISSION CONTROL) 


The GS 20 adaptive transmission control feature automatically selects suitable shifting pro¬ 
grams based on driving style, selected range, monitored signal activity and road/environ¬ 
mental conditions. Advantages to the AGS shift control include: 

• Shift points adapted to the driving style 

• Improved safety - no unwanted up shifting while in a tight curve, 

• Automatic determination and selection of the winter program for better driveaway trac¬ 
tion and reduced shift activity. 

• Improved comfort - Starting in second gear in stop and go traffic. 

The AGS can be divided into two functional groups: 


1. Driver influenced features 

2. Features that react automatically to the driving style and environmental conditions. 


DRIVER INFLUENCED FEATURES OF AGS 


The adaptive drive program is based primarily on throttle input from the MS 42.0 control 
module via the CAN bus. The calculated rate of pedal position change influences the selec¬ 
tion of the shift points. 


Moderate movement 
causes moderate 
downshifts while a 
quick application of 
the throttle initiates a 
downshift. 

The GS 20 also 
monitors braking 
and kickdown 
request.

KICK DOWN EVALUATION 


Economical driving: Shifter in D. Drive with slow application of throttle. This provides low 
and comfortable shift points providing high fuel efficiency. 


Quick accelerator pedal activity automatically leads the GS 20 into the intermediate power 
mode. Based on this input data, the AGS automatically selects a sporty shift strategy. 

Sport: Shifter in "D", shift points are higher to take advantage of the full engine perfor¬ 
mance. The sport program is also immediately activated by a kick down request or exces¬ 
sive braking. 

22 


Automatic Transmissions 


















The AGS driving programs are not adapted on a long term basis - nor is it stored 
in the GS 20 control module memory when the ignition key is switched off. 

The GS 20 continuously monitors the driving style and adapts to meet the current 
driver requirements. 

AGS FEATURES THAT REACT TO OPERATING CONDITIONS 

Stop and Go Driving: This feature is activated by a defined sequence of shifts which are 
as follows: 

• Upshift from first to second - followed by a downshift from second to first - followed by 
another upshift from first to second. This is then followed by the vehicle coming to a 
complete stop. 

After this sequence, the transmission will stay in second gear. The GS 20 AGS program 
has recognized stop and go driving and this function prevents excessive shifting during 
heavy traffic conditions. The second gear start is cancelled when: 

• The throttle pedal movement exceeds limits (quick step on the pedal) 

• The range selector is moved to P, N or R. 

Curve Recognition: This feature is activated when the GS 20 detects a variation of front 
wheel speeds via the CAN bus. The Mark 20 El control module broadcasts the wheel 
speed sensor signals and their speed variations for any control module programmed to 
monitor this condition. When curves are recognized, the GS 20 inhibits up shifting until the 
front wheel speed signals equalize indicating the vehicle is driving straight ahead. This fea¬ 
ture enhances the vehicle handling characteristics when cornering at higher speeds. 

Winter Drive Program: Wheel slip is calculated by the GS 20 based on wheel rotation 
data provided by the traction control system via CAN bus. The GS 20 modifies shift char¬ 
acteristics to match winter mode for better traction. When active, the transmission will 
start in second gear and the shift points are lowered. The purpose of this program is to 
improve the drivability of the vehicle with slippery road conditions. 

Cruise Control Program: When cruise control is activated, the MS 42.0 control module 
communicates this status via the CAN bus. The GS 20 activates a program suitable for 
active cruise control operation preventing pendulum locking/unlocking of the torque con¬ 
verter and minimizes up/down shifting. Additionally, the MS 42.0 can request a downshift if 
the vehicle speed exceeds the set speed limit when coasting downhill. 

Hill Recognition Program: The GS 20 activates this feature when it detects a high engine 
load condition at lower road speeds. When the vehicle is traveling up hill the shift points 
are raised to prevent repetitive up/down shifting. 

23 


Automatic Transmissions 



NON AGS FUNCTIONS 

The following features are part of the GS 20 automatic control system - but not AGS spe¬ 
cific control features. 

Manually Selected Extra Sport Program: Longer delay shift pattern with higher engine 
RPM. This program is similar to the AGS detected sport program but requires the driver to 
move the range selector from D to 4th gear or lower. 

This program automatically returns to AGS shift program selection when the shifter is 
returned to the D position. 

Engine Warm Up Cycle: Based on the detected engine coolant temperature (CAN), the 
shift points are raised during cold engine operation. This is implemented to speed up the 
warm up cycle of the catalytic converter. 

Downshift protection: If the driver moves the range selector to a lower gear at higher 
vehicle speeds, the GS 20 delays the down shift until the road speed drops below a pro¬ 
grammed value. This feature protects the powertrain from unnecessary loads ensuring long 
life operation.

ADAPTIVE HYDRAULIC PRESSURE CONTROL: 


The GS 20 monitors engine speed via the CAN bus along with the transmission input and 
output speed signals simultaneously to determine the slip ratio and slip time during a shift. 
Slip ratio and slip time are influenced by production related differences between transmis¬ 
sions and by aging. 

The comparison of target & real slip allow the GS 20 to perform the adaptive pressure con¬ 
trol function by modifying the PWM control of the main pressure regulator solenoid increas¬ 
ing the clutch apply pressures to compensate for internal slip. The adaptive pressure con¬ 
trol function optimizes the shift quality and increases the life span of the clutch plates. 

The adaptive pressure control feature is not an AGS function. 



Clearing adaptation values with the DIS or 
MoDiC only clears this pressure control 
adaptation values. Clearing these values 
can lead to bad shift quality until the shift 
pressure is again optimized by the adapta¬ 
tion.

EMERGENCY PROGRAM (SAFETY MODE) 


If a malfunction causes the GS 20 to activate the Emergency Program, the 
transmission fault indicator and the Check Engine Light in the instrument cluster 
both illuminate (CAN signal activation) and electronic control terminates. 



The transmission shifts manually in the following sequence: 

• For range selector lever positions D, 4, 3 or 2, Fifth gear is immediately activated (no 
electrical control). P, R and N positions operate normally. 

• Torque converter lock up clutch is not functional 

• Reverse lock out is also not functional. 


If the vehicle is stopped and restarted with this condition, the vehicle drives normally until 
the condition that initially caused the Emergency Program activation is once again detect¬ 
ed. 


If the initial problem was a power down of the GS 20 control module, the transmission will 
shift manually in the following sequence: 

• For range selector lever position D, 4, 3 or 2, Fourth gear is immediately selected. P, R 
and N positions operate normally. 

• Torque converter lock up clutch is not functional 

• Reverse lock out is also not functional.

SERVICE AND REPLACEMENT PARTS 


For a severely malfunctioning A5S 360R transmission, the service procedure is to exchange 
it with a replacement core once an authorization has been obtained. However, there are 
replacement parts available for Limited Service Repairs. 

Transmission Identification: 

As with all BMW transmissions, an identification plate is attached to the transmission hous¬ 
ing. The plate provides a two character alpha code signifying identification. 

Refer to the alpha code when ordering a replacement transmission. This code must be 
checked against the parts system verifying the code is correct for the specific vehicle and 
for possible code/part number supersession. 



The ID plate of the A5S 360R pro¬ 
vides the following data:

GS 20 PROGRAMMING: 

The control module must be programmed to update resident program data in an existing 
or after replacing a defective GS 20 control module. As with previous systems, the fault 
memory must be cleared and the system fully functional. 

Connect a battery charger to the vehicle prior to programming to ensure adequate voltage 
supply during the programming procedure. When programming is completed, clear the 
system adaptation values using the DIS or MoDiC. 

Always make sure the programming software is the latest version. 


31 



BASIC TROUBLESHOOTING 

• Always personally verify the customer complaint. 

• Always verify that the complaint is truly a system malfunction. 

• Perform a Quick Test to determine if the vehicle systems have logged fault codes. 

• Call up the faulted system or appropriate test schedule to verify the correct control 
module is installed in the car. 

• Follow the Diagnostic Information System (DIS) on screen instructions and perform all 
tests as specified. 

• Use the DIS and fault symptom diagnostic procedures as trained. 

• Follow the appropriate test module procedures for systems that malfunction but fail to 
set faults in memory. 

• To get a thorough understanding of automatic transmission issues, a GM or ZF 
Technical Specialist must be contacted whenever a vehicle is brought into the workshop 
with an automatic transmission related concern. Always have the printouts of fault 
codes stored in the DME and EGS and the transmission serial number available when 
calling. 

• If there is no Service Information Bullitin published which addresses the specific 
complaint, do not make any repairs to a 5 speed automatic transmission prior to 
contacting a GM or ZF Technical Specialist. Contacts may be made by calling the 
BMW Technical Plotline: 1-800 472-7222

1.2 Converter 
clutch 


As in all automatic transmissions, power is transmitted via 
the torque converter with converter clutch and via the drive 
and brake clutches to the planetary gear and on to the 
output flange. 

The basic functions of the torque converter and the torque 
converter clutch are described in the training manual "BMW 
Automatic Transmission: Design and Function". 

The features in which the torque converter and torque 
converter clutch differ from the A5S310Z are as follows. 

- The weight of the torque converter has been reduced and 
the converter clutch has no torsion dampers, so the mass 
moment of inertia has been optimised. 

- No torsion damper in the torque converter clutch, further 
optimising the mass moment of inertia. 

- This transmission permits oil flow to continue when the 
torque converter clutch closed. This reduces the oil 
temperature in the torque converter. 

The torque converter clutch linings have small ducts to 
permit this flow of oil. 

- The torque converter clutch is closed in third, fourth and 
fifth gears. As in the A5S440Z, clutch closure is slip- 
controlled. 

Control is in the speed range from approximately 
25 km/h to approximately 120 km/h, depending on the 
load situation. The torque converter clutch is always 
closed at speeds in excess of 120 km/h. 

- The torque converter clutch for the 2.8 litre has two 
linings (as in the A5S440Z). The version for 2.5 litre and 
2.0 litre models has only one lining. This lining is on the 
torque converter housing, not (as in the A5S310Z) on the 
clutch.

1.3 Oil pump The basic clutch functions are described in the training 

manual "BMW Automatic Transmission: Design 
and Function". 

The delivery rate of the oil pump has been increased from 
16 cm per revolution to 24 cm per revolution. This higher 
delivery rate means that a controlled converter clutch can 
be used. 

The pump draws in oil via a filter and discharges the pres¬ 
surized oil via a flow control valve which returns excess oil 
not needed at high engine speeds to the pump intake side. 
The flow control valve directs the pressurized oil via the 
main pressure valve in the hydraulic shift unit. This valve 
regulates the oil pressure and returns excess oil to the 
intake duct, releasing energy to increase pressure on the 
intake side in the same way as the flow control valve. This 
increase in pressure prevents cavitation and reduces noise.

“1.4 Clutches The basic clutch functions are described in the training 

manual "BMW Automatic Transmission: Design 
and Function". 

The ring-type multi-disc clutches A-B-E and F are drive 
clutches which transmit engine power to the planetary gear 
set. Clutches C-D and G are brake clutches which brace the 
torque against the transmission case. 

Shifts from first to second gear are assisted by a freewheel. 
In these shifts, therefore, there is no clutch overlap. 

Shifts from second to third, from third to fourth and from 
fourth to fifth are overlap shifts. This means that one clutch 
must continue to transmit drive at reduced main pressure 
until the other clutch engages. 

The transmission dispenses with brake bands, which has 
led to improved shift quality.

Tolerance limits for the dished-spring forces were reduced 
for all clutches, so fill-pressure tolerance is down. The gap 
is now set by the snap ring so fill volume tolerances are 
narrower. The increase in wear reserves boosts operational 
dependability and transmission durability.

1.6 Planetary The basic functions of the planetary gear set are described 

. in the training manual "BMW Automatic Transmission: 

gGar set Design and Function". 

As in the A5S310Z, the A5S325Z transmission uses a 
Ravigneau planetary gear set. 

The bearings of the planetary gears have been improved in 
this transmission (e.g. double bearings for short planet 
gears and cage bearings for long planet gears). These 
design modifications reduce gear noise and improve driving 
characteristics. 

Tail planetary gear set 

The tail planetary gear set consists of a sun gear with its 
four planet gears, a planet spider and a ring gear.

weight 


At approximately 79.0 kg, the A5S325Z is about 5 % lighter 
than the A5S310Z. This increases fuel economy.

control 
system 


The basic functions of the electronic-hydraulic control 
system are described in the training manual 
"BMW Automatic Transmission: Design and Function". 


Hydraulic shift unit 


The A5S325Z has three solenoid valves and four electrical 
pressure control valves to control the shift unit. Two of the 
pressure control valves are for gear shifts. One controls the 
modulation pressure and one operates the torque converter 
clutch. Controlled converter clutch operation would not be 
possible without a pressure control valve.

1.12 Electronic 
control unit 


A new control unit is used for A5S325Z transmissions. This 
control unit has also been fitted to A5S440Z transmissions 
since model year '98. The new control unit has a modular 
plug-in system with five chambers. Not all the plug modules 
are used in the automatic transmission control unit. The 
ground connections in module 1 are longer. This ensures 
that these pins are the first to make contact when the plug 
is pushed onto the control unit.

These new high-end standard control units have shorter 
access times on account of a new, more powerful 32-bit 
processor with 256 k memory and a program run time of 
approx. 10 ms. The old control units had an 8-bit processor 
with 64 k memory and a run time of approx. 24 ms. 

The new control units exclude the possibility of skip down¬ 
shifts, for example from fifth to third. Downshifts can only be 
sequential through the gears. 

The control units optimise shift quality. The transmission 
reacts faster to load changes when, for example, the driver 
allows the car to coast and then immediately presses the 
accelerator pedal to the floor. Under these conditions, the 
A5S310Z transmission shifted up a gear and then shifted 
back down. The A5S325Z transmission cancels the upshift, 
so the transmission remains in the original gear. Shift 
transition control, too, has been improved, and clutch 
draining and filling are better matched. These measures 
have considerably enhanced levels of shift comfort.

1.13 Registering 
turbine speed 


A Hall sensor (1) registers turbine speed (spider speed) in 
the A5S325Z transmission. The magnetic pole wheel (3) at 
cylinder A (4) rotates at turbine speed and generates a pulse 
frequency. This pulse frequency is registered by the Hall 
sensor through the non-magnetic bowl (2). 


This innovation enables speed to be measured much more 
accurately than was the case with the A5S310Z trans¬ 
mission. 

Synchronisation, in turn, can be calculated to a much finer 
degree of precision. Shift quality benefits accordingly.

1.14 Programming Flashcode programming is the same as that used for the 

GS 8.55 control unit for the A5S440Z automatic trans¬ 
mission. The programming procedure is largely an adapta¬ 
tion of digital engine management programming with 
features tailored to electronic transmission control. As in 
digital engine management, flashcode control units can be 
programmed 14 times. 


Note: The adaptation values always have to be 

deleted once the electronic transmission 
control unit has been programmed. The control 
unit has to re-adapt after the adaptation values 
have been deleted. The control unit adapts 
automatically when the car is on the road. 

It is, however, advisable to perform a test run 
covering upshifts and downshifts through all 
the gears. 

The CAN bus is interrupted during pro¬ 
gramming, with the result that a CAN error 
is stored in the control units connected 
(ABS/ASC, DME etc.). Programming should 
always be followed by diagnosis to clear 
the fault memories of all the control units 
connected to the CAN bus.

1.15 Modifications 
to adaptive 
transmission 
control 


How adaptive transmission control for A5S325Z trans¬ 
missions differs from the implementation for A5S31OZ 
transmissions. 


The basic function of adaptive transmission control is 
described in the training manual "Adaptive transmission 
control unit". 


Adaptive transmission control is the same as that imple¬ 
mented for the A5S440Z transmission. This transmission 
therefore, has two adaptation modes for the A and S pro 
grams. 


A program 

Basic shift characteristic XE and shift characteristic E 
are selected in the A program. 

It is not possible to switch to the S or XS shift 
characteristics. 


S program 

Basic shift characteristic S and performance-oriented 
shift characteristic XS are selected in the S program. 

It is not possible to switch to the XE or E shift 
characteristics.

Review Questions 


1. How does the vane pump of the A5S 360R transmission regulate fluid volume? 


2. What type of signal is used to control the pressure regulator solenoid? What happens 
to the fluid pressure if the control signal is switched off? 


3. Describe how the transmission fluid heat exchanger operates. 


4. How can the AGSATCM module be distinguished from the DME/ECM? 


5. Why does the AGS module monitor the brake pedal switch? 


6. If no repairs are performed to the transmission, why is clearing the adaptation values not 
recommended? 


7. What steps must be performed before determining a transmission needs to be 
replaced?_ 


8. What is the difference between the torque converter lockup clutch between the two 
engine displacements?_
