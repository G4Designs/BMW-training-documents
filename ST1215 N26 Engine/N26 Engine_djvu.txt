Introduction 


N26 Engine 

The N26 engine is the third generation of the BMW SULEV engines used in the US 
market. The N26 shares many technical features with the current N20 engine. This 
engine is currently available in the F30 328i as of 3/2012. The new N26 engine is the 
first turbocharged SULEV gasoline engine worldwide that requires no secondary air 
system. 

This not only means that the BMW Group is complying with the requirements of the 
world’s most stringent exhaust emission legislation, but also underlines the fact that 
the term “premium” is being defined by the many facets of substantiality to an ever 
increasing extent. Twin Power Turbo technology enables dynamic performance and 
achievement of low fuel consumption while adhering to the most stringent exhaust 
emission limits.

N26 Engine Features 

The N26 engine also shares many features with the N20 engine, such as the cylinder 
head, valvetrain, engine block, crankshaft, pistons. Over 95% of the N26 engine is carried 
over from the N20. 

By using the latest technology TVDI (Turbocharged Valvetronic Direct Injection) in 
conjunction with a TwinScroll exhaust turbocharger, it is now possible to decrease 
emissions substantially, while at the same time maintaining the same power output 
as the N20.

* Valve train 

Same as N20 

* Camshaft 

Same as N20 

* Belt drive 

Same as N20 

* Oil supply 

Same as N20 

* Crankcase ventilation 

The N26 engine uses the same crankcase ventilation principle as N20 engine. The 
main difference is that the pressure regulating valve is now welded to the cylinder 
head cover. This is now considered hydrocarbon emissions tight. 

* Cooling system 

Same as N20 

* Evaporative system 

Same as N20

N26 Engine 



* Air intake and exhaust system 

The air intake and exhaust systems differ slightly on the N26.engine. 

There is an additional HC filter located in the air filter box to capture hydrocarbon 
emissions. The exhaust turbocharger is identical to the N20 but now incorporates 
an electric wastegate valve actuator. 

Note: As of 07/2012 all N20 engines will have electric wastegates. 

* Secondary air system 

Not required 

* Vacuum system 

Vacuum reservoir no longer integrated into engine cover. 

* Fuel system 

Bosch HDEV5.2 solenoid valve injector is an inward-opening multi-hole valve. 

These injectors are identical to the N55 and N20 from a technical point of view. 

The N26 injectors are refered to as “sorted”, which means that they are less prone 
to leakage. The leakage is <0.5mm 3 /min @20MPa. (200bar) 

* Engine electrical system 

Engine management MEVD17.2.9 is used with the N26 engine with new internal 
programming. 

Adaption algorithm for continuous injector individual measurement of the opening 
and closing time, (flight phase of the injector needle) by characteristics of the current 
signal. 

Higher precision of the injected fuel quantity, especially required for ‘double” 
injection for heating-up of catalytic converter. 

Engine wire harness modification , due to electric wastegate. 

Note: All N20 engines will receive MEVD17.2.9 starting with 07/12 production. 

Engine Identification 

Engine Designation 

In the technical documentation, the engine designation is used to ensure the clear 
identification of engines. 

The N26 engine is available in the following version: N26B2000 

In the technical documentation, you will also find the short form of the engine designation 
N26 which only permits identification of the engine type.

Engine Identification and Number 

To ensure clear identification and classification, the engines have an identification mark 
on the crankcase. This engine identification is also necessary for approval by the 
authorities. 

Decisive here are the first seven positions. The N26 engine has an engine identification 
that complies with the new standard, in which the first six positions are the same as the 
engine designation. The seventh position is a consecutive letter that can be used for 
various distinctions, e.g. power stage or exhaust emission standard. A general assignment 
is not possible, but an "A" usually means the basic model. 

The engine number is a consecutive number that permits unmistakable identification of 
each individual engine. The engine designation and number are on the crankcase behind 
the bracket for the air conditioning compressor.

N26 Specific Components 


Cylinder Head Cover 

The cylinder head covers are made of plastic. They accommodate the oil separation of 
the crankcase ventilation. The oil separators are made of plastic and are very similar to 
those in the N20 engine. The major change to the cylinder head cover is that the 
crankcase pressure regulating valve is now welded to the cover and no longer to be 
replaced separately.

High Pressure Fuel Pump 

The maximum system pressure remains the same as the N20 at 200bar. The HP pump 
has been slightly redesigned for the N26 engine. It has been modified by adding a groove 
in the outlet valve of the high pressure pump. This allows the high fuel pressure to be 
reduced in a short amount of time when the engine is shut off. This reduces the risk of 
internal and external fuel leakage.

Fuel Injectors 

The fuel injectors used in the N26 are identical to the N20 and N55 from a technical 
point of view. The major difference is the N26 injectors are hand selected after they have 
been tested to insure they have the minimum amount of leakage. These are referred to as 
“Sorted” fuel injectors. They have a leakage rate of <0.5mm 3 /min @20MPa.

Fuel Line 


The fuel lines have been modified to insure that no leakage occurs. The low pressure line 
from the fuel tank to the engine compartment is made of plastic (polyamide). The line 
from the engine compartment to the HP pump is corrugated pipe made of stainless steel, 
this is designed to prevent hydrocarbon evaporation and leaks. The corrugated pipe is 
protected by a layer of rubber that looks like a regular fuel hose.

Turbocharger 


Exhaust Turbocharger 

The turbocharger on the N26 engine is identical to the N20. The only difference is 
that N26 uses an electric wastegate actuator. This is required to assist in the rapid 
heating of the catalytic converter to meet SULEV emission requirements.

Exhaust System 


Catalytic Converter 

Fitted in close proximity to the engine, the close-coupled catalytic converter has been 
designed as a two-stage construction (first monolith: 900 cpsi, second monolith: 600 
cpsi) “Cells Per Square Inch”. The catalytic converter used on the N20 uses 600 cpsi on 
the first monolith and 400 cpsi on the second. 


t 



There is an additional catalytic converter located under the vehicle downstream of the 
exhaust. This converter is not monitored and contains 400 cpsi.

N26 Engine 




Additional Emission Reduction Measures 

HC Fleece 

The air intake system is similar to the M56 and N51 SULEV engines. There is an addi¬ 
tional HC fleece filter installed in the air box. This prevents hydrocarbons from escaping to 
the atmosphere when the engine is at rest. The HC fleece is part of the upper portion of 
the air box and needs to be replaced as a complete unit if damaged. 



Cooling System 

The radiator of the N26 SULEV looks similar to the standard F30 radiator. The surface of 
the cooling fins are coated with a special “PremAir” coating. The coating consists of 
multiple porous layers of a catalytic surface. The task of the catalyst coating is to convert 
Ozone into Oxygen.

System Overview 


The cold start and subsequent catalyst warm-up phase hold the key to meeting the 
SULEV limits. The majority of all air contaminants are emitted during the first approxi¬ 
mately 30 s of the exhaust emission test. 

The purpose of the catalyst heating mode at the beginning of the exhaust emission test is 
to use the exhaust gas to heat the catalytic converter up to light-off temperature as quick¬ 
ly as possible with a minimum of emissions and excellent smooth running. Turbocharged 
engines constitute a particular challenge in this respect as the exhaust-gas turbocharger 
acts as an additional heat sink en route to the catalytic converter, thereby delaying light- 
off accordingly. 

The direct injection system with its centrally positioned injector is capable of a much 
more retarded ignition than can be achieved in an engine with a manifold injection sys¬ 
tem and it therefore accelerates the catalyst warm-up process considerably. 


A lean catalyst heating mode is used with “double injection”. The first injection takes 
place during the intake phase and contains the main injection volume. It serves to 
generate a homogeneous, lean basic mixture. The second, lower-volume injection is 
precipitated as the ignition injection is just after TDC and it accelerates or stabilizes the 
combustion process by increasing the turbulence in the already ignited basic mixture, 
enabling the application of a highly retarded ignition. This lean burn mode enables follow¬ 
up reactions with the excess oxygen in the exhaust gas, causing the temperature of the 
exhaust gas to rise and reducing the CO and HC emissions. 


Apart from combustion concept optimization, another important prerequisite for compli¬ 
ance with the SULEV values is the minimization of the heat loss by the exhaust gas en 
route to the catalytic converter. As mentioned above, the turbocharger constitutes a spe¬ 
cial challenge in its capacity as an additional heat sink upstream of the catalytic converter 
and causes considerable delay in light off. 


The amount of heat loss by the exhaust gas during catalyst heating can be reduced if as 
much exhaust gas as possible is routed via the wastegate directly, bypassing the turbine. 
The exhaust gas should also flow through the wastegate ports into the catalytic converter 
without any direct contact with the walls. The flow to and through the wastegate ports 
was maximized. The maximum wastegate opening angle is increased from 25° to 45°, 
using an electric wastegate actuator that also offers other functional advantages. 


By implementing these measures, the proportion of exhaust gas routed through the 
wastegate is considerably increased from 40 to 70%.

Driving Performance and Fuel Consumption 

The SULEV version of BMW’s new 2.0-1 four-cylinder gasoline engine also offers the 
dynamic driving performance that is typical of BMW in conjunction with low fuel con¬ 
sumption. The engine delivers a maximum torque of 350 Nm and a maximum power of 
180 kW/240 hp. These figures represent a 30% and 4% improvement over the respec¬ 
tive values of the predecessor engine. At the same time, the useable engine torque range 
is greatly enhanced. Compared with its predecessor the N51, the new 328i SULEV 
boasts significant improvements in driving performance, as well as a substantial reduction 
in fuel consumption.
