Introduction 


The power supply is a combination of hardware and software that ensures the necessary 
power for all the vehicle systems. 

Essentially it can be divided into two major functions: 

• Energy management 

• Power management 

The energy management system ensures that sufficient starter motor current is always 
available and monitors the vehicle even when the engine is off. Energy management 
includes all the components in the vehicle that generate, store and consume energy. 

The data for the energy management is distributed across a number of control modules. 

Power management is a subsystem of the energy management. The power manage¬ 
ment is run from the engine control module Digital Engine Electronics or Digital Diesel 
Electronics (DME or DDE). While the vehicle is being driven, the power management 
regulates the power output of the alternator as well as the battery charging. 

For more information regarding Energy and Power management refer to the Power 
Management section of this training material. 

The following are the basic components that make up the power supply system: 

- Battery 

- Alternator 

- Battery cables 

- Battery safety sensor 

- Intelligent battery sensor 

- Distribution box 

- Junction Box Electronics 

- Car Access System 

- Digital Engine Electronics or Digital Diesel Electronics 

- Multiple Restraint System 

- Bit-serial data interface 

- Relay box

Power Supply Components 


Battery 

General Battery Information 

The battery is a chemical accumulator for 
the energy generated by the alternator. The 
battery is used in BMW vehicles as a start¬ 
ing battery which primarily serves to start 
and fire internal-combustion engines. The 
starter battery can delivery high currents for 
brief periods. 




>12,6V 


The battery must be able over a limited peri¬ 
od of time (even when the engine is stopped) to supply important components of the 
vehicle electrical system with electrical energy. The battery must also have a damping 
effect in the event of voltage peaks in the electrical system in order to protect electronic 
components. 


The battery consists of various cells connected in series. The cells are the smallest units 
in a battery and essentially comprise positive and negative electrodes, the separators 
and the parts reguired for assembly. 


Battery Aging 

All batteries are subject to natural wear and 
tear caused by the normal aging process. 
The battery depicted as a drum can only 
be completely filled when it is in perfect 
condition. The chemical processes in the 
battery consisting of the charging cycles 
with battery charging and discharging 
result in the formation of deposits in the 
battery which prevent the battery from 
maintaining full capacity. 

Permanent self-discharge caused by sta¬ 
tionary loads/consumers or increased ener¬ 
gy consumption is another factor that dic¬ 
tates battery aging. Wear can be signifi¬ 
cantly increased by high or maximum 
demands (exhaustive discharge). Storage 
temperatures above 35 °C speed up the 
rate of battery self-discharge.

AGM Battery 

Increasingly more powerful batteries are required because of the ever higher energy con¬ 
sumption of modern vehicle electrical systems. Since September 2002 all BMW vehicles 
have also been equipped with Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries, better known 
as Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) batteries. 

Similarly sized AGM or VRLA batteries offer the 
following advantages: 

• Longer service life. 

• Increased starting reliability at low tempera¬ 
tures. 

• Safe and reliable starting of engines with high 
power requirements. 

• Because the sulphuric acid is completely 
retained in the glass-fiber fleece, no sulphuric 
acid can escape in the event of damage to 
the battery housing. 

Note: These batteries can be recognized by their black housings 
and by the fact that they have no magic eye. 

An AGM battery differs from its lead-calcium counterpart in the following features: 

• Larger plates. 

• 25 % higher power density. 

• Separators made of glass-fiber fleece: this produces a cycle strength which is 3 
times as high. This in turn improves cold-starting capability, current consumption 
and service life. 

• Sealed housing with pressure relief valve (VRLA). 

• Battery acid retained in the glass-fiber fleece. 



5 

Power Supply 


Mode of Operation 

The AGM battery differs from conventional batteries in its environmentally compatible 
and substance-maintaining performance during charging. When vehicle batteries are 
charged, the two gases oxygen and hydrogen are released. 

• In a conventional, wet lead-calcium battery, the oxygen and hydrogen are dissipated 
to atmosphere. 

• In an AGM battery, these two gases are converted back into water. The oxygen 
which is created during charging at the positive electrode passes through the per¬ 
meable glass-fiber fleece to the negative electrode, where it reacts with the hydro¬ 
gen ions in the electrolyte to form water. 

In this way, no gases escape and electrolyte is not lost. 

Special Features 

In the event of an excessive build-up of gas, i.e. excessive pressure increase (20 to 200 
mbar), the pressure relief valve blows off gas without allowing atmospheric oxygen to 
enter. Hence the designation VRLA. 

Housing 

AGM batteries must not be opened under any circumstances as the entry of atmospheric 
oxygen would cause the batteries to lose their chemical balance and render them inoper- 
ational. 

Installation Locations 

AGM batteries on account of their high spatial temperature differences must not be 
installed in the engine compartment. This would significantly reduce their service life. 

Battery Replacement 

A lead-calcium battery can always be replaced with an AGM battery provided the installa¬ 
tion conditions conform to the specifications for AGM batteries. The use of an AGM bat¬ 
tery does not reguire any changes to be made to the vehicle electrical system. 


Alternator 

With the engine running, the alternator generates a variable charge voltage for battery 
charging. The variable charge voltage is influenced by the power management depending 
on the temperature and current.

Power Supply 



Battery Cables 

Depending on the vehicle the battery cables can be located in the vehicle interior or on 
the outside (under the floorpan). Depending on the model and equipment specification, 
the starter cable may also be equipped with a monitoring lead. 

Some vehicles may be fitted with several battery cables. The starter cable is typically 
routed via the jump-start terminal point to the starter and the alternator. 

Other battery cables are routed from rear to front power distribution box and to the elec¬ 
tronics box in the engine compartment. These battery cables are designed in various 
cross-sections and materials. Copper and aluminum cables are currently used.

On the E70, for example, two main power leads run along the underbody from the battery 
box to the engine compartment. One of the main power leads is routed via the jump start 
terminal to the starter and to the alternator. 

The other cable supplies the engine electronics with power. Depending on the model of 
vehicle, different cable cross sections are used. 

The battery cable that connects to the front distribution box is installed in the vehicle inte¬ 
rior. The transfer points (magnified view) for the two main power cables is located in the 
battery box. To avoid damage, the main power cables are installed in a protected area on 
the underbody.

In the F01/F02, three main power lines on the underbody run from the distribution box at 
the battery to the engine compartment. One of the main power lines runs via the positive 
battery terminal to the starter motor and to the alternator. 

The second line powers the engine electronics (and electric coolant pump). 

The third line runs to the distribution box in the engine compartment. This distribution 
box supplies the electric fan with power. This line is safeguarded by the high-current fuse 
(100 A) in the distribution box at the battery.

In the E90 the starter, alternator, engine electronics and to the junction box are supplied 
by three main supply cables. These cables are run along the right side of the vehicle with 
the battery located the luggage compartment. 



1. One main cable is routed on the interior of the vehicle along the right side, to the 
junction box located behind the glovebox. 

2. Two additional main cables run from the B+ terminal underneath the vehicle to the 
engine compartment: 

• One cable goes to the jump start terminal in the engine compartment 
and then connects to the starter and alternator. 

• The second cable is used to supply power to the engine electronics 
(DME and Valvetronics). 



Within the battery box are two 
transfer points (as shown) for the 
two cables that run to the engine 
compartment. 

The main power cables going to 
the engine compartment are 
i n sta 11 ed/ro u ted (as indicated) in a 
protected area underneath the 
body of the vehicle.

Aluminum Ribbon Cable 

Since the launch of the E65/E66 vehicles an aluminum ribbon cable has been used as 
the battery cable in BMW vehicles. Depending on the vehicle model, the battery cable is 
equipped with a sensor lead. 

The battery cable is routed from the battery via the jump-start terminal point to the starter 
and the alternator.

Battery Cable Monitoring 


The battery cable is fitted with a low impedance metal mesh, which is insulated against 
the body and against the battery cable. This metal mesh is referred to as the monitoring 
shield.

On the E60, for example, the battery cable is routed from the luggage compartment out¬ 
side of the underbody of the vehicle into the engine compartment. If the cable is dam¬ 
aged in an accident or when driving over an obstacle (e.g. crash barrier), the battery cable 
is disconnected from the battery and the alternator is switched off. This prevents a short- 
circuit and the risk of sparks. 

The monitoring cable in the engine compartment side is connected to the left B-pillar 
satellite and on the battery side (inside the luggage compartment) it is connected to the 
right B-pillar satellite. The battery cable is diagnosed by a special circuit between the 
SBSL and SBSR satellites.

Battery Safety Terminal 


The Battery Safety Terminal (BST) is used to 
reduce the risk of a short circuit to the B+ termi¬ 
nal of the battery in the event of an accident, as a 
result of a short circuit on the cable running from 
the B+ terminal of the battery to the Starter & 
Alternator (an unfused/unprotected circuit). 

Depending on the severity of an accident 
incurred, the MRS control module will provide a 
signal to the BST which will disconnect the B+ 
cable going to the Starter & Alternator. 

In the event that the BST is activated, power will 
continue to be supplied to the rear power distrib¬ 
ution box (a fused/protected power distributor) to 
allow activation of all other vehicle systems (such 
as hazard lights, power locks, power windows, 
Engine Electronics etc.).

13 

Power Supply 









Because the battery cables are divided up in the rear distribution box, the rest of the vehi¬ 
cle electrical system remains operational when the safety battery terminal is triggered as 
long as none of the main fuses disconnect the circuit as the result of a short circuit. This 
ensures that all the important functions, such as e.g. hazard warning flashers, telephone, 
remain operational. 


Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS) 


The intelligent battery sensor is an important component of the energy management in 
BMW vehicles with higher level equipment (e.g. navigation system). 

The term “intelligent” means that there is a microprocessor integrated in the IBS. This 
microprocessor calculates and analyses time-critical measured variables. The results are 
then forwarded to the higher-level control units (i.e. DME) via the LIN bus. 

The IBS continually measures the following: 

• Battery terminal voltage 


• Battery charge/discharge current 

• Battery acid temperature 


This information is made available to the power management system in the DME/DDE. 
The IBS is located directly on the battery negative terminal and can thus be used for 
many BMW vehicle types. 


The IBS can withstand temperatures of up to 105 °C and chemical loads and is therefore 
suitable for installation in both the luggage compartment and the engine compartment.

The intelligent battery sensor (IBS) is used to determine precisely the "state of charge" 
(SoC) and the "state of health" (SoH) of the battery. 

The IBS consists of mechanical, hardware and software elements. The mechanical part 
consists of the battery terminal with ground cable for the negative terminal. 

The functions of the mechanical section are: 

• Providing electrical contact of the vehicle body with the negative terminal. 

• Accommodating the sensor element for current measurement. 

• Accommodating the hardware. 

• Providing sufficient thermal contact between the temperature sensor of the 
hardware and the battery negative terminal. 

• Providing protection for the sensitive electronic components. 

• The battery terminal is the ground connection for the IBS. 

The enhanced intelligent battery sensor as of FI 0 enables better detection of the battery 
condition by: 

• Detection of defective battery cells. 

• Calculation of the remaining battery capacity. 

Each total discharge results in a loss of battery capacity: 

The longer the battery remains completely discharged, the greater the 
loss of battery capacity. 

The batteries installed at BMW can withstand several short total dis¬ 
charges or up to two long total discharges, however, when they are 
fully recharged with a constant charging voltage of 14.8 V after the 
total discharge. 

For all models before FI 0, we should use the Midtronics tester, NOT a 
VAT40 or equivalent. For FI 0 and later vehicles, a battery test is built 
into the vehicle (through the IBS), and is accessed using ISTA. 

Note: A battery may only be replaced on FI 0 when identified as faulty using 
ISTA (the test plan returns a Diagnostic Code for the replacement) 

Note: For further information regarding the IBS (intelligent battery sensor) 

refer to the Energy Management with Micro-power Module in the Power 
Management section of this training material.

Power Distribution Boxes 


The fuses and relays are spread over different power distribution boxes in BMW vehicles. 
Some examples of possible installation locations are depicted in this chapter. 

The distribution boxes can be incorporated in the luggage compartment, in the engine 
compartment and behind the glovebox. Even a combination of all three installation loca¬ 
tions is possible, such as e.g. E65/E66. 

In the E7x and FOx vehicles, there are two separate distribution boxes. The front distribu¬ 
tion box is near the glove box and the rear distribution box is on the right-hand side of the 
luggage compartment. 

The following graphic shows the arrangement of the most important components of the 
power supply system in the FOx.

Junction Box 

A battery cable leads from the power distribution box to the junction box. A junction box is 
installed in all vehicles as from the E90. The junction box is installed behind the glovebox 
beneath the instrument panel. 

The junction box consists of two units: 

• Junction box, electric part 

• Junction box control unit 

The junction box control unit is responsible for many functions such as the rear window 
defogger, power windows, outside mirrors, gateway function for the bus systems, etc. 

Depending on the optional equipment installed in the vehicle, the electrical part of the 
junction box is equipped with various relays and fuses. In the bottom section of the junc¬ 
tion box there is an opening which connects the junction box control unit to the electrical 
part of the junction box and the vehicle wiring harness. 

This graphic describes the F01/F02 front fuse carrier(l). In the right-hand part of the front 
fuse carrier, there is an opening through which the junction box electronics (2) are con¬ 
nected to the front fuse carrier.

Front Fuse Carrier and Junction Box Electronics 

The connection between the front fuse carrier and the junction box electronics is estab¬ 
lished through the opening in the right-hand area of the fuse carrier. An internal plug 
connection provides the electrical connection between the two components. 

Junction box electronics and front fuse carrier in the F01/F02 



When assembled, the two components form a single unit (junction box) consisting of 
the junction box electronics and the front fuse carrier. 

The fuse carrier and junction box electronics components must be replaced separately. 
In addition to the corresponding test modules in the diagnostics, diagnosis cables are 
also available with which electrical measurements can be made directly on the control- 
unit plugs and on the internal interface.

Terminals 


All electrical loads in the vehicle must be connected to ground on the one side and to the 
positive voltage on the other. In electrical engineering applications, a terminal provides a 
detachable connection or serves the purpose of connecting wires, cores and cables. In 
motor vehicles, the term terminal refers to connection points, at which control units and 
electronic components are supplied with current. There are various terminals with stan¬ 
dardized designations. The most important terminals in the voltage supply system are 
described in more detail based on the following example.

Terminal 30 

All electrical loads in a vehicle are permanently connected to ground via the negative ter¬ 
minal of the vehicle battery. Some of the electric loads in the vehicle are also permanently 
connected to the positive terminal of the vehicle battery. This current circuit is interrupted 
only by switches or relays. 

The terminal in the vehicle's electrical system, at which battery voltage is permanently 
applied is referred to as terminal 30 (also known as B+ or continuous positive). With the 
battery installed and connected, electrical power is made available on this branch of the 
wiring harness when the ignition is turned off and the ignition key removed. Terminal 30 
powers the control units and assemblies which must remain operative even when the 
vehicle is shut down or which only require electrical energy in order to maintain data. 

The switch for the hazard warning light system, for example, is powered via terminal 30. 

Terminal R 

A proportion of the electric loads is connected to the positive terminal of the battery only 
after inserting the ignition key in the ignition lock and turning it to the first notch position, 
thus applying the electric loads with current. In this case, the ignition lock acts as a 
switch. The terminal is designated terminal R. 

Example: If connected via terminal 30 (continuous positive), a car radio can be operated 
even when the ignition key is removed. If, on the other hand, it is connected via terminal 
R, it can be operated only when terminal R is switched on. In addition to the radio, the 
control unit for the safety system (MRS, ACSM) also receives its voltage via this terminal. 

Terminal 15 

Terminal 15 (also switched positive, ignition positive) is activated when the ignition key is 
turned to the second notch position. Further control units and electrical components 
receive their voltage supply via terminal 15. 

For example, the air conditioning system and parking aid (PDC) are switched on via 
terminal 15. Terminal R and terminal 15 are controlled by the CAS control unit. 

Terminal 31 

Because every current consumer is incorporated in a circuit, it requires the necessary 
earth/ground connection in addition to the B+ power supply. The connection to the bat¬ 
tery negative terminal is established via a separate ground lead and the body panel. 

This connection is also known as terminal 31 (ground). 

Because the number of electrical systems and loads has increased, it would cause con¬ 
siderable problems to screw every ground connection directly to the body. 

For this reason, BMW vehicles have central ground points with screwed-on strip connec¬ 
tors for accommodating as many ground leads as required.

Vehicles with Reduced-weight Aluminum Front End (GRAV) 

The reduced-weight aluminum front end is connected to the steel body by way of a 
ground connection. 

The ground point for jump-starting is located on the front left spring support. In the event 
of a jump start, there is a risk of high currents flowing through the punched connection, 
which causes the rivets to heat up and results in damage to the adhesive.

Ground connection bracket of the reduced-weight aluminum front end (GRAV) 


The weight-reduced aluminum front end (GRAV) ground connection also improves the 
vehicle's electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). 

Aging connections between the front end and the remaining car body do not affect the 
EMC. 

The contact resistances between the front end and the remaining car body are bridged 
by means of the ground bracket.
