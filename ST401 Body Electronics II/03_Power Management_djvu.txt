Power Management 


Introduction 


The power supply of most current BMW vehicles is a combination of hardware and soft¬ 
ware that ensures the necessary power for all the vehicle systems. 

Essentialy it can be divided into two major functions: 

• Energy management 

• Power management 

The energy management system ensures that sufficient starter motor current is always 
available and monitors the vehicle even when the engine is off. Energy management 
includes all the components in the vehicle that generate, store and consume energy. 
The data for the energy management is distributed across a number of control modules. 

Power management is a subsystem of the energy management. The power manage¬ 
ment is run from the engine control module Digital Engine Electronics or Digital Diesel 
Electronics (DME or DDE). While the vehicle is being driven, the power management 
regulates the power output of the alternator as well as the battery charging. 

For more information regarding Power Supply components refer to the Power Supply 
section of this training material.

Power Management 













A vehicle's electrical system basically consists of an energy storage device (battery), an 
energy generator (alternator) and a large number of electrical loads (electrical/electronic 
devices). Electrical energy is taken from the battery in order to start the engine via the 
starter (electric load). Once the engine is running, the alternator supplies current which, in 
the ideal case, is sufficient to supply all electric loads and charge the battery. If the cur¬ 
rent reguirement of the connected electrical loads is higher than the current supplied by 
the alternator, the system voltage will drop to the level of the battery voltage and the bat¬ 
tery will be discharged. 



The task of the vehicle electrical system is to provide electrical energy for the vehicle and 
all its functions. Priority is given to maintaining the starting capability of the vehicle. The 
purpose of the energy management system is to ensure and balance the energy in the 
vehicle under all operating conditions. 

The main component of every energy management system is the power management 
software in the engine control unit (DME/DDE). The task of the power management soft¬ 
ware is to control the flow of energy in the vehicle. 

The alternator is designed to supply current to all electrical loads and charge the battery. 
If the alternator is not able to supply sufficient current to the electrical loads the additional 
current reguirement is taken from the battery.

Power Management 






Power Management 

The main component of every energy management system is the power management 
software in the DME/DDE. The power management is a subsystem of the energy man¬ 
agement system that controls the flow of energy in the vehicle. 

The power management system regulates the power consumption of some of the most 
important electrical devices and the power output of the alternator while the vehicle is 
being driven. 

The power management functions are carried out by the engine management control 
module (DME). In most current BMW vehicles the IBS is partially responsible for power 
management when the vehicle is at rest. 

The tasks of the power management system include: 

• Adaptation of the alternator charging voltage. 

• Idle speed boost for increasing the power output of the alternator. 

• Reduction of peak loads in the event of a shortfall in coverage provided by the vehi¬ 
cle electrical system. 

• Deactivation by means of bus messages of electric loads such telephone, on reach¬ 
ing the start capability limit of the vehicle. 

• Closed-circuit current diagnosis.

Power Management 

























Adaptation of the Alternator Charging Voltage 

In unfavorable road situations, such as e.g. urban traffic or traffic jams, the variable battery 
charging voltage ensures a better battery charge balance. 

The power management controls the specified voltage for the charging voltage of the 
alternator via the BSD line. 

The specified voltage is dependent on: 

• The battery temperature 

• The current consumption of the vehicle 

The battery charging voltage is controlled as a function of temperature. In this way, the 
battery uses less water during the charging procedure and does not degas as guickly at 
higher outside temperatures. 

Idle Speed Increase 

If the specified voltage on its own is no longer sufficient and the battery is showing a 
deficit, the DME increases the idle speed up to 200 rpm (FOx). 

Criteria for increasing idle speed are: 

• Alternator fully utilized 

• State of battery charge is low 

Reducing Peak Loads 

The peak load of the vehicle electrical system is reduced when there is still a shortfall in 
battery coverage despite boosting idle speed. 

Peak load reduction is realized by: 

• Reducing power output, e.g. by correspondingly controlling the clock cycles of the 
rear window defogger. 

• If reducing the power output is not sufficient, individual electric loads can be 
switched off in extreme situations. 


9 

Power Management 



Electrical Load/consumer Deactivation 

The loads/consumers can be categorized as follows: 

• Comfort loads/consumers, e.g. heated window, seat heating, steering wheel heating. 

-These loads/consumers switch off automatically after engine "OFF" and can be 
activated again after the vehicle has been restarted. 

• Stationary loads/consumers reguired by law, e.g. side lights, hazard warning lights, 
must be operational after engine "OFF" for a specific length of time. 

- Legally reguired stationary loads/ consumers are not switched off even on reaching 
the start capability limit of the battery. 

• Other stationary loads/consumers, e.g. independent heating, independent ventila¬ 
tion, central information display, telephone, telematic services. 

- Other stationary loads/consumers can be switched on after engine "OFF." The 
comfort electric loads/consumers switch off automatically on reaching the start 
capability limit of the battery. Switch-off is reguested by the DME in the form of a 
CAN message. 

• System-related afterrunning loads/ consumers, e.g. electric radiator fan. 

- System-related afterrunning loads/ consumers can maintain operation for a defined 
period of time. 


Closed-circuit Current Diagnosis 

A fault code is stored in the DME/DDE when the battery current exceeds a defined value 
during the vehicle rest phase. 

Battery Charge Management 

There are two "counters" in the power management module. One counter is responsible 
for the battery charge and the other for the battery discharge level. The state of charge of 
the battery SoC is formed by the difference between the charge acceptance and draw 
levels. The power management module receives the corresponding data from the IBS via 
the BSD line. 

The power management module calculates the current SoC value on restarting the 
vehicle. 


10 

Power Management 



Battery - state of Health 

When the vehicle is started, the battery terminal voltage and the starting current of the 
starter are measured by the IBS. 

The starting current and voltage dip determined during the start phase are transferred via 
the BSD line to the DME/DDE. From these data, the power management module calcu¬ 
lates the state of health (SoH) of the battery. 

Data Transfer to the IBS 

The following data are transferred via the BSD line (or LIN Bus depending on model) to 
the IBS before the DME goes into sleep mode: 

• State of charge of the battery (SoC) 

• Outside temperature 

• Available discharge level 

• Terminal 15 wake-up enable 

• Terminal 15 wake-up disable 

• DME close 


Transport Mode 

Indication of Battery Condition 

The batteries in vehicles coming off the production line are adeguately charged so that 
SOC > 80% (SOC - “State of charge”). However, since several days or weeks can pass 
between the time the vehicle comes off the production line and when it is delivered to the 
customer, the battery will have discharged to a greater or lesser degree. Therefore, every 
battery must be charged according to the recharging calendar. 

The F01/F02 is the first model on which it is possible to display the charge level of the 
battery when the new car is being transported. When production or transport mode is 
activated, a Check Control message is generated that provides a guick indication of the 
battery condition. 


11 

Power Management 



Note: If the SOC has dropped to less than 35%, the indication continues to be 
displayed on the instrument cluster until the battery is replaced and a 
change of battery is registered.

Note: When transport mode is reset, there is no indication on the instrument 
cluster of the battery charge level. 

Note: If the vehicle is delivered with the red Check Control message “Battery 
charge level very low” active, it is essential that the low battery charge is 
recorded as transport damage on the delivery note. 

In such cases, the test module “Energy diagnosis” must be carried out to establish the 
cause. Replace the battery before handing over the vehicle to the customer and register 
the change of battery using the service function. 

~ If a vehicle is delivered with the yellow Check Control message “Charge 
j! battery”, this should also be recorded on the delivery note. The battery 
must then be charged once and an energy diagnosis carried out.

Electrical System and Battery Diagnosis 

Over the past few years, the energy management of all BMW models has been continu¬ 
ously improved and standardized across the various model series. In terms of energy 
diagnosis, this also means standardization of testing schedules and displays in the BMW 
diagnostic system. 

The aim of the diagnostic procedures is to show the causes of a discharged battery as 
unambiguously as possible. In view of the complexity, especially in the area of energy 
management, the specific cause of a fault can be shown only partially depending on its 
nature. The acguired energy diagnosis data are shown if the fault cannot be clearly 
assigned based on the acguired data. 

Power management is retained in full while the expanded diagnostic options are now resi¬ 
dent in the history memory. 

In FOx vehicles the ZGM monitors the vehicle status, registers inhibited sleep mode or 
unauthorized wake-up after Terminal 30B is switched off and reguests a reset or shut¬ 
down of Terminal 30F by a bus message to the JBE. 

The originator and reason for wake-up (unauthorized wake-up) are stored as additional 
information in the ZGM fault memory. The driving profile for the last 5 weeks is stored in 
the JBE energy history memory. The energy history memory is referred to for energy 
diagnosis purposes. 

Stationary Cycle 

After the engine has been turned off, the battery undertakes the task of supplying electri¬ 
cal loads with current. The number of electrical loads that can be activated with the igni¬ 
tion turned off is limited in order not to excessively discharge the battery. Only a few func¬ 
tions are available such as the radio, exterior/interior lights, hazard warning lights or 
renewed engine start. Functions such as the seat heating, rear window defogger, air con¬ 
ditioning etc. cannot be activated. 

Several control units are disconnected from the power supply after a specific period of 
time so that the battery is not permanently subjected to load. This is known as "Sleep 
Mode" or the rest state of the control units. For example, the radio or the interior lighting 
are switched off automatically after a certain period of time. Exceptions include control 
units that are responsible for the functions reguired by law, e.g. exterior lighting.

Electronic ride-height control 


In order to protect the battery, ideally the battery should be disconnected from the electri¬ 
cal system after shutting down and locking the vehicle. This, however, is not possible as 
the antitheft alarm system, for instance, must remain in operation or the control unit for 
unlocking the vehicle (CAS) must receive current at all times. Consequently, this means 
that electrical energy is constantly taken from the battery while the vehicle is stationary 
and a small current, the so-called closed-circuit current, flows. The number of control 
units that are supplied with current via terminal 30 (continuous positive) is kept to a mini¬ 
mum so that a maximum closed-circuit current of 80 mA is not exceeded in BMW vehi¬ 
cles. This measure ensures the battery does not suffer exhaustive discharge even over 
longer periods of time. 

A fault code is stored in the DME/DDE if the battery current exceeds a value of 80 mA 
during the vehicle rest phase. The energy management initiates automatic shutdown if 
some control units cannot assume sleep mode after a certain period of time. 


14 

Power Management 
















Closed-circuit Current 

Although for most models a closed circuit current reading below 50mA is prefered, a 
Check Control message is generated (raised battery discharge rate when parked) if a 
closed-circuit current level of >80 mA is detected. 


Note: The closed-circuit current should always be measured if increased cur¬ 
rent consumption is suspected.Even power consumption levels only 
slightly above normal can cause relatively rapid battery discharge. 

The graph below shows the typical closed-circuit current progression on the F01/F02 
associated with the various electrical system statuses. The actual current values change 
depending on the vehicle equipment configuration. 

The terminal “load shut-down” (e.g. reading or 60 minutes with light and vanity mirror 
light) is switched off corresponding to the terminal status. 

Load shut-down switches off immediately when the vehicle is secured. In all other termi¬ 
nal statuses, the load shut-down terminal is switched off after an overrun period of 8 min¬ 
utes. It is activated by the footwell module.

Power Management 

























Closed-circuit Current Measurement 

Increased closed-circuit currents may occur permanently or intermittently and cause the 
battery to discharge prematurely. The increase in closed-circuit current may be caused by 
a faulty control unit, or by the installation of a non-approved accessory. 

In a situation where a vehicle has broken down due to a discharged battery, for diagnostic 
purposes it is important not to disconnect the battery. This is because a control unit will 
be reset if the battery is disconnected. Following a reset, the faulty control unit may start 
functioning correctly again, making accurate diagnosis impossible. 

To correctly measure closed-circuit current, the 50-amp clip-on probe (previously used 
with the MIB) can now be used in conjunction with the IMIB (Integrated Measurement 
Interface Box) to properly diagnosis closed-circuit current problems over an extended 
period of time. Connect the 50-amp clip-on probe directly to the IMIB Measurement 
input 3 (green socket). Refer to SI B04 35 09 for information about the IMIB. 

Note: Refer to the Battery Service Information section in this training material 
for more information on Closed Circuit Current measurement and to 
SI B61 08 00.

Closed Circuit Current Measurment with the IMIB 

This technique with an IMIB is particularly suitable for extended measurements, and pro¬ 
vides a graphical readout of recorded measurements overtime. It is recommended for sit¬ 
uations where the use of a multimeter provided insufficient information for problem diag¬ 
nosis. 

1. The IMIB can be accessed from any ISID within the workshop. 

2. Select "Activities". 

3. Select "Measuring devices". 

4. Select from the "Level 1" column, "Measuring devices", and then "OK". 

5. From the "Connection manager" screen, select the free IMIB and "Set up 
connection". 

6. The "Measures devices" screen opens on the "Multimeter" tab. 

7. Select the "Oscilloscope" tab. 

8. Highlight the "CHI" tab to activate channel 1. 

9. Under channel 1, "Source", scroll with the arrows to select "Clip-on probe 50A". 

10. Make sure that clip-on probe is not connected to the battery cable, and acknowl¬ 
edge the pop-up message with "OK". 

11. Change the "A/Div" setting to "1 A". 

12. Under the "Time" selection box, change the "Time/Div" setting based on the 
number of measurements needed (5 ms to 200 s). The longer times should be 
selected when performing the measurement over an extended period. 

13. Select "CH 1" under "Cursor" to monitor the actual readings. 

14. Select "Record" if performing long term measurements. 

15. After performing the measurement, select "Record" again; the display will change 
to "Compress" and display the recorded data on the 1 screen.

Optimum Charging 

The battery voltage can vary between 14 V and 15.5 V. The optimum charging voltage is 
set by the power module as a function of the state of charge of the battery, the battery 
temperature and the lamp resistance. The maximum charging voltage is 16 V. 

Detection of state of charge of battery 

The power module detects the state of charge of the battery at all times by calculating 
the battery current while the vehicle is moving and by measuring the discharge current. 
When the vehicle is stationary, the state of charge is recalculated by means of a closed- 
circuit voltage measurement at the battery and adopted.

Temperature-Dependent Battery Charging Voltage 

By using a charging characteristic map stored in the PM, the charge voltage of the gener¬ 
ator is adjusted according to the battery temperature. The previus diagram shows the 
communication path necessary for the Power Module to inform the generator to increase 
or decrease charge voltage output.The alternator charging voltage is set as a function of 
the battery temperature using the charging curve stored in the power module. 

The power module detects the temperature of the battery and sends the message 
"Charging voltage increase" to the K-CAN PERIPHERALS. The CAS forwards the mes¬ 
sage to the K-CAN SYSTEM. 

The central gateway module receives the message and forwards it to the PT-CAN. The 
Digital Motor Electronics receives the request to increase the charging voltage via the 
PTCAN. 

The alternator receives the request to increase the charging voltage via the BSD line. 

The electronic evaluation unit in the alternator sets the requested charging voltage. 

Idle Speed Increase 

As little energy as possible is drawn from the battery in the interests of improving the 
charge balance. The idle speed is increased early in order to prevent an increased draw 
of energy. This ensures that the battery has a higher state of charge. 

If this drops below the calculated start capability of the battery, the idle speed is increased 
to 750 rpm. 

Peak Load Reduction 

Load-side peak reduction If while the engine is running a battery discharge (in spite of 
increased idle speed) is detected, loads/consumers are reduced or deactivated in stages 
in accordance with a priority table. 

These loads/consumers are: 

• Heated rear window 

• Seat heating 

• Heater fan (without defrost function) 

• Steering wheel heating 

• Mirror heating 

• Wiper console heating 


24 

Power Management 



Load/consumer Deactivation 

In order that the battery is not discharged in the event of a permanent activation of loads/ 
consumers, a central load/consumer deactivation is performed 16 minutes after terminal 
R off. 

These loads/consumers are: 

• IB (Interior lights) 

• VA_K (Load/consumer deactivation, body area) 

• VA_D (Load/consumer deactivation, roof area) 

Load/consumer Deactivation in Event of Undervoltage 

In the event of an undervoltage due to high loads, the power module transmits a mes¬ 
sage to increase idle speed and for load/consumer deactivation after the voltage drops 
below 10.5 V (for 5 seconds). Load/consumer deactivation is conducted in accordance 
with the priorities stored in the power module. 

The power outputs of the power module are deactivated at the same time. 

These loads/consumers are: 

• IB (Interior lights) 

• VA_K (Load/consumer deactivation, body area) 

• VA_D (Load/consumer deactivation, roof area) 

Deactivation of stationary loads/consumers 

In order to safeguard the start capability of the vehicle, the state of battery charge is 
also monitored when the vehicle is stopped. 

A minimum state of charge is determined is order to guarantee start capability. 

This is dependent on: 

• The measured temperature of the last few days 

• The engine type 

• The capacity of the installed battery 

If the state of charge approaches this limit value because a stationary load/consumer 
is active, the power module prompts this load/ consumer to switch itself off. 

The following are stationary loads/consumers: 

• CD (Color Display) 

• DWA (Anti-theft alarm system) 

• LSZ (Light switch center) 

• EGS (Electronic transmission control) 

• IHKA (Integrated automatic heating/air conditioning) 

25 

Power Management 



Closed-circuit Current Monitoring 

The closed-circuit current monitoring function is activated in the power module when the 
battery switch is set to ON. 

The power module switches to the closedcircuit current monitoring function at terminal 0 
after 60 minutes. Closed-circuit current monitoring begins again if an action on the vehi¬ 
cle (e.g. central locking, open rear lid) occurs before a period of 60 minutes has elapsed. 

After this period has elapsed the closed-circuit current must not exceed 80 mA. If howev¬ 
er the closed-circuit current is higher than 80 mA, the message "Shutdowncounter" is 
sent by the power module after 5 minutes. After a further 90 seconds disconnection of 
the vehicle electrical system is completed for 5 seconds. 

Disconnection is repeated if the closed-circuit current after reactivation is still higher than 
80 mA. 

If the closed-circuit current is still higher than 80 mA, permanent disconnection is per¬ 
formed by the electronic battery master switch. 

The fault (incl. boundary conditions and the reason for the increased closed-circuit cur¬ 
rent) is set in the power module's fault memory. 

When the terminal 15_w signal is detected, the electronic battery master switch is closed 
and a Check Control message "Increased closed-circuit current" is displayed. 

Closed-circuit current monitoring is cancelled by the message Side lights ON and hazard 
warning lights. The loads/consumers required by law must not be deactivated. 

Distribution Mode 

By repositioning the battery switch, the power module switches to the Distribution mode 
function 30 minutes after terminal R off. Prior to disconnection the message "Shutdown" 
is sent by the power module. Disconnection is completed after a further 90 minutes. 

After ignition lock position terminal R ON a Check Control message is sent which alerts 
the driver that the vehicle is in Distribution mode. The message "Battery switch OFF" 
appears. 

The electronic battery master switch is closed when the terminal 15_w signal is detected 
or by repositioning the battery switch to "closedcircuit current monitoring". 

Note: The vehicle can also be started and driven in Distribution mode. All the 
systems are operational. The Check Control message remains active. 
With terminal R Off, disconnection is initiated again after 30 minutes, 
as described above. 


26 

Power Management 



Electronic Fuse 

The electronic battery master switch is opened when a short-circuit current in excess of 
250 A is detected. Only after the terminal 15_w wake-up signal from the CAS is detected 
is an attempt made to close the electronic battery master switch. 

The procedure is repeated until the short circuit is eliminated. 

Central battery voltage specification The power module measures the battery voltage 
continuously. This voltage is made available to all the other electronic control units via 
their bus connection. This facilitates for example a continuous operation of the slide/tilt 
sunroof irrespectively of the battery voltage. 

There are no individual measurements of the individual control units with central battery 
voltage specification. 

Rear Window Heater 

The electronic output stage of the heated rear window in the power module is activated 
by a K-CAN message from the IHKA control unit "Heated rear window ON" output. 

Interior Lighting 

The interior lights are divided into three outputs (groups). 

• IB (Interior lights) 

• VA_K (Load/consumer deactivation, body area) 

• VA_D (Load/consumer deactivation, roof area) 

The interior lights are controlled by the power module. 

VA_Kand VA_D are switched as a function of the corresponding ON/OFF contacts. 


27 

Power Management 



Trunk Lid and Fuel Tank Flap Control 

The power module controls the functions of the body electronics in the area of the rear lid: 

• Trunk lock actuator 

• Trunk lid Soft Close Automatic 

• Fuel tank flap locking 

The necessary software, such as e.g. switchon times and repeat interlocks, is integrated 
in the power module. 

Anti-theft Alarm System 

The power module is used to monitor the rear lid via the SCA contact of the anti-theft 
alarm system. 

Information Memory 

Vehicle-related data are stored in the information memory. These data make it possible to 
indicate the status of the load and service life of the battery. The information memory can 
be read out by way of diagnosis. 

Emergency Mode Functions 
Battery temperature sensor 

A substitute value of 20 °C is accepted in the event of an open circuit, a short circuit or 
an implausible value. This corresponds to a fixed charging voltage of 14.3 V at the battery. 

The battery capacity can now only be calculated under limited conditions. 

Battery switch 

The system switches to closed-circuit current monitoring if the battery switch is fault-free. 

Terminal 15_w 

The following signals prevent deactivation of the power module without terminal 15_w: 

• Terminal 15 (via CAS bus connection) 

• Vehicle speed > 2 km/h via DSC bus connection (Dynamic Stability Control) 

• System voltage > 13.2 V (PM central voltage specification) 

Bus Communication 

If bus communication is not possible, all information is "frozen."

Power Management 



Energy Management with Micro-Power Module 

The energy management system with the micro-power module is used in the E60, E61, 
E63, E64. Energy management has the same basic functions as power management in 
the DME. 

Energy management with the micro-power module differs from the E65 power module 
system in the following details: 

• Permanent monitoring of the charge/discharge current by the intelligent 
battery sensor. (IBS) 

• Terminal 15 wake up 

• Load/consumer deactivation timecontrolled by terminal 30g relay 

• Load/consumer deactivation faultcontrolled by micro-power module 

• Closed-circuit current diagnosis and violation of fault storage 

Intelligent Battery Sensor 

The intelligent battery sensor IBS is a mechatronic component. The IBS with its own 
microcontroller which continually measures the following parameters: 

• Battery terminal voltage 

• Battery charge/discharge current 

• Battery acid temperature 

The IBS is located directly on the battery negative terminal and is used on all current 
BMW vehicle. 

The intelligent battery sensor (IBS) is part of the power management system. The IBS is 
used to determine precisely the "state of charge" (SoC) and the "state of health" (SoH) 
of the battery.

Power Management 








































The software in the IBS controls the process and communication with the DME (Digital 
Motor Electronics) control unit. The IBS sends the data via the bit-serial data interface 
(BSD) to the DME. The following functions are integrated in the IBS: 

• Continuous measurement of the battery current, voltage and temperature under all 
vehicle operating conditions. 

- When the vehicle is stationary, the measured values are interrogated cyclically 
every 40 s to save power. The measuring period of the IBS is approx. 50 ms. The 
measured values are entered in the closed-circuit current histogram in the IBS. 

• The state of battery charge (SoC) is partly calculated. 

- The DME/DDE reads out the closedcircuit current histogram after the vehicle is 
restarted. A corresponding entry is made in the fault code memory of the DME if a 
closedcircuit current infringement is determined. 

• The IBS sends the data via a bit-serial data interface to the DME. 

• Calculation of the battery indicators as the basis for the state of charge (SoC) and 
state of health (SoH) of the battery. 

- The battery indicators are charge and discharge current, voltage and temperature 
of the vehicle battery. 

• Balancing of the charge and discharge currents of the battery. 

• Permanent monitoring of the state of battery charge. 

-Transmission of date in the event of a deficit. 

• Calculation of the current progression when starting the engine to determine the 
state of battery health. 

• Closed-circuit current monitoring of the vehicle. 

Charge Management by the IBS 

The IBS continuously balances the state of battery charge even when the vehicle is sta¬ 
tionary. 

The current SoC is stored in the IBS every 2 hours. 3 locations are reserved in the mem¬ 
ory for this purpose. The first entry is made at location 1, locations 2 and 3 are overwrit¬ 
ten every 4 hours. 

From terminal 15 "On" the DME/DDE updates the value to the current values of the bat¬ 
tery indicators.

Before the DME assumes sleep mode, it informs the IBS of the current SoC of the 
battery. The IBS sends the wake-up signal when the available SoC is used up. 

The DME obtains information on the current SoC of the battery from the IBS. 

The IBS informs the DME when the SoC of the battery is critical. 

The DME requests the stationary electrical loads/consumers to switch off. 

The DME no longer permits the IBS to wake the vehicle. 

The vehicle subsequently reassumes sleep mode. 

The wake-up function only applies when the vehicle is at rest.

In order to ensure a proper energy balance and battery start capability, specific stationary 
loads/consumers are deactivated by the terminal 30g relay after a prespecified period of 
time. 


The terminal 30g relay is activated by the Car Access System CAS and effects a defined 
deactivation of loads/consumers. 

The terminal 30g relay is installed in the power distribution box in the luggage compart¬ 
ment. 

Switch-on and switch-off conditions of terminal 30 g relay 

The switch-on conditions are: 

• Unlock vehicle 

• Terminal R "ON" 

• Auto-remote closing via remote control 

• Status change of door contacts or of rear lid contact 

• Telephone wake-up line for telematic services 

• Service application 

The switch-off conditions are: 

• 60 minutes after terminal R "OFF" 

• Service application

The terminal 30 g switch-off procedure disconnects various electrical loads/ consumers 
in a defined manner from the vehicle electrical system. This happens approx. 60 minutes 
after terminal R "OFF." 

The deactivated loads/consumers are activated again together with terminal 30g "ON." 
The following loads/consumers are deactivated: 

• Center console switch center 

• Rain and driving lights sensor 

• Controller 

• Central information display 

• Slide/tilt sunroof 

• Tyre pressure control 

• Satellite radio 

• TOP HiFi amplifier 

• Telephone 

• Flead-up display 

• Active cruise control 

• Electronic transmission control 

• Dynamic Stability Control 

• Adaptive directional headlights 

Service Mode 

The BMW diagnosis system can be used to place the vehicle in sleep mode in the work¬ 
shop within 5 secs, by means of the Power Down command. 

This is necessary in order to carry out a guick and continuous closed-circuit current with¬ 
out waiting for the normal deactivation time to elapse (60 mins.).

Power Management 




Micro-power Module with Bistable Relay 

As with the terminal 30g relay, the micropower module enables a defined deactivation 
of loads/consumers in the event of a fault, i.e. excessive closed-circuit current. 

Deactivation only takes place with the vehicle at rest when a fault occurs in the 
communication area. 

The following faults trigger deactivation: 

• Excessive closed-circuit current in the event of a critical SoC 

• Number of K-CAN wake-up procedures exceeded 

• Undervoltage 

• Vehicle does not go into sleep mode. 


Integration in the K-CAN 

The micro-power module is connected to the K-CAN. 

The micro-power module detects 3 operating states, 
namely normal mode, sleep mode and service mode.

Normal mode 

All functions of the micro-power module are available in normal mode. 

The micro-power module switches OFF/ON the voltage supply to all the loads/con¬ 
sumers involved in communication. 

These loads/consumers are: 

• M-ASK (Multi-Audio System Controller) 

• CCC (Car Communication Computer) 

• CDC (Compact Disc Changer) 

• DVD changer 

The supply voltage is switched on and off by means of a bistable relay. The relay is set to 
"ON" when it leaves the factory. The switchon condition has priority over the switch-off 
condition. 

The switch-on conditions are: 

• Creation for the first time of the supply voltage at the 
micro-power module "First Switch to Power" 

• Locking/unlocking 

• Terminal R "ON" 

• Terminal R 15 "ON" 

• Changes in status of door contacts or of trunk lid contact 

• Bus activity 

The switch-off conditions are: 

• Excessive closed-circuit current in the event of a critical SoC 

• Signal "Stationary loads/consumers OFF" by DME 

• Undervoltage < 9 V for a time period > 60 seconds 

• Number of K-CAN wake-up procedures exceeded 

• Bus activity after 60 minutes in spite of the vehicle having stopped, 
i.e. the vehicle cannot go into sleep mode after terminal R "OFF". 


36 

Power Management 



The relay disconnects the loads/consumers from the vehicle electrical system with a 5- 
minute delay. This delay allows the respective loads/consumers to sign off from the elec¬ 
trical system. The switch-off procedure is interrupted if a switch-on condition applies dur¬ 
ing this 5-minute period. 

Special cases for switch-off conditions: 

• The loads/consumers have already been disconnected from the 
vehicle electrical system 

• The vehicle door is opened without the vehicle being started 

• Bus activity 

Sleep mode 

The micro-power module goes into sleep mode approx. 1 second after the K-CAN has 
gone into sleep mode. 

The current switching status of the relays is stored before the micro-power module goes 
into sleep mode. 

The micro-power module is woken by the terminal 15 signal via the K-CAN or by activa¬ 
tion of terminal 15. 

On waking, the switching status of the relay last stored is reestablished.

Power Management 



Energy Management with Junction Box 

Introduced with the E90 the Energy Management System with Junction Box uses an 
energy management function that is similar to that used in the E60 Micro Power Module 
System to ensure balanced power/energy distribution in the vehicle. The system was 
further developed for use in the E70 and it is currently part of the BN2020 in the FOx 
vehicles. This training material discusses all three systems with emphasis on FOx vehi¬ 
cles. 

The energy management functions in vehicles with junction boxes are executed in the 
power management system of the DME (See chart on page 21 of this chapter). 

The IBS provides exact information regarding the condition of the battery such as actual 
voltage, current and internal temperature to the DME.This allows for greater flexibility in 
regulating loads and also provides additional diagnostic functions with regard to energy 
consumption. 

There are two different systems, depending on the vehicle eguipment specifications: 

• BPM (Basic Power Management) 

• APM (Advanced Power Management) 

The BPM is identical to the basic energy management in other BMW vehicles. 

The BPM is installed without a IBS. 


There are two different operating modes: 

• Vehicle operation (terminal 15) 

• Vehicle stationary (terminal R and terminal 30) 

Basic Power Management 

This variant features only idle speed increase and charging voltage specification.

The following functions are integrated in both management systems: 

• Idle speed increase 

• Charging voltage specification 

In addition to the main functions of basic power management (idling speed and reguired 
battery charge voltage), APM also incorporates the following extended functions: 

• Electric load reduction 

• Electric load shut-down 

• Vehicle systems diagnosis 

• Battery diagnosis. 

As is the case with energy management with the micro-power module, an IBS (intelligent 
battery sensor) is installed for APM. 


APM charging voltage specification 

With APM the outside temperature is not used to calculate the battery temperature. Here 
the battery temperature is measured directly with the IBS. 

The power management uses this value as the input variable for calculating the battery 
temperature. With the aid of a calculation model, the specified charging voltage is set 
based on the battery temperature. 

This information is sent via the BSD line to the alternator. 


The reguired battery charge voltage is determined 
according to outside temperature and IGR function 
in most current FOx vehicles.

Effect of Outside Temperature 

The required battery charge voltage function ensures electrochemically optimum battery 
charging by adjusting the battery charge voltage according to temperature. Since the 
current absorbed by a cold battery is lower, the voltage for charging must be higher than 
for a warm battery. 

Conversely, if that higher voltage were constantly used to charge a warm battery, there 
would be a risk of gas formation. Therefore, the charge voltage is regulated on the alter¬ 
nator according to temperature. The current battery temperature is measured by the 
intelligent battery sensor (IBS) attached directly to the battery negative terminal and sig¬ 
nalled to the engine management module (DME) via the LIN bus. 

The power management uses this value as the input variable for calculating the battery 
temperature. With the aid of a calculation model, the specified charging voltage is set 
based on the battery temperature. This information is sent to the alternator via the bit- 
temperature of serial data interface (BSD). 

Battery Regeneration 

In order to ensure the availability of IGR Low, a certain level of unused capacity must 
always be retained in the battery. That is implemented by means of IGR High and IGR 
Medium. For the battery, that means that it is never fully charged. If a battery were not 
fully charged over a long period or were left fully discharged, sulphation could occur. 
Sulphation causes a battery to prematurely age, thereby reducing the usable proportion 
of its rated capacity. To prevent that occurring, the required battery charge voltage func¬ 
tion performs a battery regeneration cycle in the course of which the battery is fully 
charged. 

On vehicles with IGR function, regular battery regeneration phases are maintained in 
order to protect the battery against premature aging and loss of capacity due to cyclic 
discharge and sulphation. That involves the battery being fully charged using the maxi¬ 
mum permissible charge voltage taking account of ambient conditions (temperature, 
charge level). 

Emergency Operation 

The APM makes use of emergency operation set to a constant 14.3 V. A fault code func¬ 
tions when there is a break in the LIN “Communication LIN” is entered in the fault inter¬ 
face. In this case, the alternator voltage is code memory of the engine management.

F01 Energy Management 



Electric Load Reduction 

In order to reduce the power consumption in critical situations, not only can the idling 
speed be increased and the required charge voltage raised, the power of various non- 
essential electrical devices can be reduced or they can be switched off altogether. 

That prevents the battery being discharged. 

The electrical devices (that consume power when the engine is running) are subdivided 
into two classes. 

• Class A 

A reduction of the power consumption or shut-down of these devices is only notice¬ 
able to the driver to a limited degree or after a delay. Individual Class A devices are 
only switched off or have their power consumption reduced under the following 2 
conditions: 

- Battery charge status in critical range 

- High load on alternator. 

• Class B 

A reduction of the power consumption or shut-down of these functions is immedi¬ 
ately noticeable to the driver. Individual Class B devices are only switched off or have 
their power consumption reduced under the following condition: 

- Battery charge status in critical range. 

Class A Electrical Devices 

The following measures are taken for Class A devices under the conditions specified 
above:

Electric load reduction 

In vehicles with APM, in addition to increasing the idle speed and the charging voltage 
specification, it is also possible to deactivate various loads/consumers to reduce power 
consumption. 

Load/consumer deactivation is performed under the following two conditions: 

• State of battery charge in critical range 

• Alternator fully utilized 

Energy Flow 

During vehicle operation, the mechanical energy of the engine is converted by the alter¬ 
nator into electrical energy and made available to the electric loads. The electric loads 
receive their power supply mainly via terminal 30g and via terminal 30g_f. 

Certain electric loads are also still supplied directly by terminal 30 or by terminal R. For 
example, the anti-theft alarm system (DWA) must still remain active when the vehicle is 
parked.

Information Flow 

The calculations necessary for controlling the energy balance take place in the power 
management. The idle speed and charging voltage are regulated while the engine is run¬ 
ning. The power intake of electric loads with relatively high power consumption is 
reduced or the loads are switched off as reguired. 

Certain electric loads can be switched off when the engine is stationary. This takes place 
either time-controlled via the CAS and the terminal 30g relay or in response to electrical 
faults via the engine control, junction box and the terminal 30g_f relay.

Vehicle in Stationary Mode (terminal R and terminal 30) 

Electric Loads in Stationary Mode 

Certain electric loads may be active even when the closed-circuit current monitoring 
facility of the power management is already in operation. This is necessary for various 
reasons: 

• Legally required electric loads, e.g. side lights, hazard warning system 

• Convenience for the customer, e.g. radio function, telephone 

These electric loads must be excluded from the closed-circuit monitoring system in order 
to avoid misinterpretation in the power management. For this purpose, these electric 
loads must log in with the power management. 

In turn, the power management recognizes the activity and accepts the higher power 
consumption when the systems are deactivated, the corresponding control units log off 
from the power management. 

Stationary Load Log-off 

The power management in the engine control can send a request to switch off the active 
electric loads in stationary mode depending on the battery charge status and the start 
capability limit. As a result, the stationary loads must deactivate their functions 
irrespective of the terminal status and must reach their closed-circuit current within 5 
minutes. Legally required electric loads are excluded from this function. 

Terminal 30g and Terminal 30g_f 

The system is equipped with various relays for switching off the power supply to most 
control units. There are two terminal 30g relays in the front and rear power distribution 
boxes. The terminal 30g_f relay in the rear power distribution box is required for the 
following optional equipment: 

• Multi-audio system controller 

• Car communication computer 

• Comfort Access 

• Instrument cluster 

• Telephone US/telephone preparation US 


46 

Power Management 




The terminal 30g relay switches off the connected electric loads after 30 minutes. 

The after-running time is extended to 60 minutes if a telephone or auxiliary heating 
system is installed in the vehicle. The terminal 30g relay is activated by the CAS. 

The terminal 30g_f relay is activated by the junction box control unit and switches off the 
connected electric loads if a fault occurs. The terminal 30g_f relay is a bistable relay. 

Each switching status is retained even when no power is applied. 

The relays are controlled by following control units: 

• Terminal 30g_f - activation by the junction box control unit 

The calculation necessary for activating the terminal 30g_f relay takes place in two 
control units. The following activities are monitored in the junction box control unit: 

- Invalid wake-up procedures within the bus systems 

- Sleep blockers (control units that constantly keep the bus systems active) 

The battery values are constantly read and evaluated in the engine control unit. The relay 
is also switched off when the starting capability limit of the vehicle battery is reached. 

• Terminal 30g - activation by the CAS

General Measures (E70) 

The terminals "load shut-down" and the terminal "interior lighting" are switched off as a 
general measure when the vehicle is in stationary mode. This occurs only when the 
vehicle is not locked and secured. These loads are shut down immediately when the 
vehicle is locked and secured. 

This measure affects the following electric loads:

System Components 


Components 

The components of the energy management system are: 

• Engine 

• Alternator 

• Vehicle battery 

• Intelligent battery sensor 

• Junction box module 

• Engine management (power management) 

• Loads 

The most important components of the energy management system are described 
in the following. 

Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS) 

The intelligent battery sensor has a similar range of functions to the intelligent battery 
sensor on previous models. A new feature is data transmission between the IBS and the 
engine management module via LIN bus and the wake-up function of the IBS.

Power Management 













The intelligent battery sensor (IBS) is a mechatronic component for monitoring the 
battery condition. The description “intelligent” indicates that the IBS has an integral 
microprocessor. That microprocessor performs the computation and assessment of 
time-critical measured variables. 

The power supply for the IBS is provided by a separate lead from the power distribution 
box on the battery. The data from the IBS is passed to the higher-level control units 
(DME) via the LIN bus. If necessary, the IBS can wake up the Junction box module via a 
separate lead.

Power Management 






















The following physical battery variables are registered by the IBS: 

• Current 

• Voltage 

• Terminal temperature. 

Among other things, the following main functions are integrated in the IBS: 

• Continuous measurement of the battery current, voltage and temperature under all 
vehicle operating conditions. 

• Calculation of the battery indicators as the basis for the charge and health status of 
the battery. The battery indicators are charge and discharge current, voltage and 
temperature of the vehicle battery. Alongside calculation of the battery indicators, 
preliminary computation of the battery charge level (“state of charge”, SOC) is also 
carried out. 

• Balancing of the charge/discharge current of the battery. 

• Continuous monitoring of the battery charge status and making available the corre¬ 
sponding data in the event of insufficient battery power. 

• Calculation of the current progression when starting the engine to determine the 
battery health status. 

• Closed-circuit current monitoring of the vehicle. 

• Self-diagnosis 

Wake-up Function 

When the vehicle is in idle mode, the IBS continuously records the data relevant to the 
battery indicators. The IBS is programmed to wake up every 14 seconds in order to 
update the measured data by taking new readings. The time required to take the read¬ 
ings is approximately 50 milliseconds. The measured data is stored on the IBS in the 
memory for recording the closed-circuit current. 

The wake-up function applies only when the vehicle is in idle mode. If the IBS detects a 
wake-up trigger, the Junction box module is woken up by a PWM signal. The IBS is 
directly connected to the Junction box module via a separate lead. 


The pulse duty factor indicates the reason for the wake-up:

20% 

Starting capacity, limit 1 

40% 

Starting capacity, limit 2 

60% 

Raised closed-circuit current 


52 

Power Management 





A wake-up due to raised closed-circuit current can take place up to three times. 

Depending on the vehicle status and reason for the wake-up, the Junction box module 
performs one of the following actions: 

• Wakes up the vehicle so that the DME can send shut-down commands to 
electrical devices that are operating while the vehicle is in parked mode 

• Resets Terminal 30F (without waking up the vehicle) 

• Switches off Terminal 30F (without waking up the vehicle). 

A fault memory entry is registered in each case. 

Commissioning 

The IBS is fully functional as soon as it has been fitted to the battery terminal (screwed to 
the grounding point and connected to the signal leads), i.e. it can immediately detect the 
basic variables, current, voltage and temperature. 

However, the variables derived from those readings for the purposes of power manage¬ 
ment, i.e. battery condition, starting capacity, etc., must first be recalculated and, there¬ 
fore, there is a time lag before they are available. 

When the engine is restarted, the DME reads off the closed-circuit current progression. 

If it diverges from the defined closed-circuit current progression, a fault is registered in the 
DME fault memory. 

In the period between “Engine OFF” and when the DME main relay is switched off, the 
IBS is informed by the DME as to the maximum charge that can be drawn from the bat¬ 
tery on the basis of ensuring that the engine can be reliably restarted. After the DME 
main relay is switched off, the IBS continually checks the battery charge level (SOC) and 
the closed-circuit current. 


Note: For more information regarding energy management components refer 
to the Power Supply section of this training material. 


53 

Power Management 



Junction Box Module 


The Junction box module (JBE) is responsible for switching the Terminal 30F relay and 
for storing information (history data and fault memory entries) related to energy manage¬ 
ment. As part of vehicle diagnostics, these data can be used to evaluate faults and to 
analyse the vehicle battery. 



Engine Management (Power Management) 

The (power management) software for controlling the energy balance is located in the 
engine management. On the basis of that control algorithm, various electrical devices in 
the vehicle’s electrical system are switched off by the CAS control unit via the Terminal 
30B relay or by the Central Gateway Module and engine management module via the 
Terminal 30F relay. The power management is additionally responsible for evaluating and 
storing the IBS data. 


54

Terminal Control 


The terminals are switched on and off by turning the key in the ignition lock 
(if equipped).

Terminal 50 (engine start) 


On vehicles without an ignition lock, the terminals are switched on and off by pressing 
the Start-Stop button. The identification transmitter (remote control) must be inserted 
and locked in its holder. The vehicle then automatically receives the terminal status ter¬ 
minal R ON. 


Terminal control on vehicles with Start-Stop button 







The terminals can now be switched with the START-STOP button in the following order: 

• Terminal R (1) 

• Terminal 15 (2) 

• Terminal R (3) 

• Terminal 0 (4) 


55 

Power Management 





















This sequence is only possible when the brake pedal is not pressed on automatic trans¬ 
mission vehicles and the clutch pedal on manual transmission vehicles. As soon as the 
brake or clutch pedal is depressed, the engine will start the next time the START-STOP 
button is pressed. 

On vehicles equipped with comfort access, the identification transmitter needs only to be 
located in the vehicle interior and not necessarily inserted in the holder. 

The identification transmitter is detected via the interior aerial. Provided the vehicle was 
shut down correctly, the terminal switching procedure start with the status terminal 0. The 
terminals can now be selected one after the other by pressing the START-STOP button. 

Terminal 30g and terminal 30g_f 

Depending on the vehicle and system, there may be more terminals in the junction box 
for power supply: 

• Terminal 30g and 

• Terminal 30g_f 

These terminals are switched by relays in the junction box. 

The terminal 30g relay is always installed. 

The terminal 30g_f relay is installed only when one of the following options is ordered: 

• M-audio system controller (MASK) 

• Car communication computer (CCC) 

Time-dependent Shutdown (terminal 30g) 

The terminal 30g relay switches off the connected electrical loads after 30 minutes. 

The afterrunning time is extended to 60 minutes if a telephone is installed in the vehicle. 
The terminal 30g relay is activated by the car access system. In the most current vehicles 
control units such as the CID (central information display), DSC (dynamic stability control), 
CON (controller) are supplied with voltage via this terminal. 


56 

Power Management 



Fault-dependent Shutdown (terminal 30g_f) 

The terminal 30g_f relay is controlled by the junction box control unit and switches off the 
connected electric loads (MASK or CCC) if a fault occurs. The terminal 30g_f relay is a 
bistable relay. Each switching status is retained even when no power is applied. 

The terminal 30g_f relay is switched on and off under the following conditions. 

Terminal 30g_f ON at: 

• Unlock vehicle or 

• Terminal R or 

• Change in contact status (rear lid and doors) 

Terminal 30g_f OFF at: 

• Receiving the "Signal OFF" message. Terminal 30g_f relay is switched 
off after 5 minutes. 

• Bus activity for 60 minutes with no switch on condition applicable. 

• Vehicle is woken 30 times with no switch on condition applicable. 

The terminal 30g_f relay is a bistable relay and is always switched on under normal condi¬ 
tions. It switches off the connected electric loads only in the case of fault. Once the ter¬ 
minal 30g_f relay has been switched off, one of the switch-on conditions is necessary in 
order to switch it on again. 

New Terminal Designation 

As of the introduction of the F01/F02 (Boardnet 2020 platform) new designations for 
some of the terminals where implemented. A distinction is also made between logical 
terminals and power supply terminals. 

The logical terminals are: 

• Terminal R 

• Terminal 15 

• Terminal 50 


Note: All Boardnet 2020 FOx vehicles are based on the F01 Terminal Control. 


57 

Power Management 



The logical terminals do not serve as power supply terminals; instead, they represent a 
status. They are activated/deactivated by pressing the START-STOP button. Their status 
is signalled to the control units by means of a bus message. 

The power supply terminals are: 

• Terminal 30 

• Terminal 15N 

• Terminal 30B 

• Terminal 30F

Terminal 15N 

Terminal 15N is used to supply power to control units and components that are only 
intended to be active when the vehicle is being driven, e.g. PDC. 

The letter “N” stands for “Nachlauf”, meaning “overrun”. The power supply Terminal 15N 
is switched on and off by means of the logical Terminal 15. The overrun time after 
Terminal 15N is switched off is 5 seconds. That time is required so that the control units 
have enough time to save their data. While Terminal 15N is active, Terminal 30B and 
Terminal 30F are also active. 

Terminal 30B 

Terminal 30B supplies power to control units and electrical components 
that are required when the driver is present. 

The letter B stands for “Basic mode”. 

Terminal 30B is activated by: 

• Pressing the buttons on the radio remote control 

• Unlocking/locking/double-locking the vehicle 

• Pressing the START-STOP button 

• Change of door switch status, change of trunk switch status, 
change of side-window position 

• Bus message 
Regular deactivation by: 

• Vehicle double-locked and tailgate closed (one minute overrun) 

• Vehicle not double-locked or tailgate open (30 minutes overrun) 

Other possible deactivation triggers: 

• Upper starting capacity limit reached (one minute overrun) 

• “Powerdown”: diagnosis command for purposes of measuring 
closed-circuit (10 seconds overrun) 

• Transport mode (one minute overrun) 

While Terminal 30B is active, Terminal 30F is also active. 


59 

Power Management 



Terminal 30F 

Terminal 30F supplies power to control units and electrical devices that are also required 
when the driver is not present but which can be switched off in the event of a fault. 

Use: all control units that are not supplied by Terminal 15N or Terminal 30B, are not 
responsible for vehicle access and do not have to meet a legal requirement for permanent 
operation. 

The letter “F” stands for “Fault”. 

Terminal 30F is activated by: 

• Pressing the buttons on the radio remote control. 

• Unlocking/locking/double-locking the vehicle. 

• Pressing the START-STOP button. 

• Change of door switch status, change of tailgate 
switch status, change of side-window position. 

• Bus message. 

In the event of a fault (closed-circuit current too high, bus wake-up, sleep-mode inhibitor, 
start capacity limit reached) Terminal 30F is reset for 10 seconds. 

Terminal 30F is not reset or switched off if at least one of the following conditions is met: 

• Terminal 30B active. 

• Parking lights switched on. 

• Side lights switched on. 

• Flazard warning lights switched on. 

• If an extended overrun time for Terminals 30B and 30F is demanded by a service 
message from any of a number of control units. Example: when the engine is warm, 
it can be necessary for the electric fan to run on for up to 11 minutes after the vehi¬ 
cle is parked and locked. In order for the electric fan to be operated, the engine man¬ 
agement module must be supplied with power. Since the overrun time in that case is 
only three minutes (that is currently the short overrun time for Terminal 30B, not one 
minute), the DME requests the appropriate extension byway of a bus message 
when the engine is switched off. 

• “Sticking relay” detected. 

Terminal 30F is switched off if Terminal 30B is off and at least one of the following 
conditions is met: 

• Starting capacity limit reached. 

• Another 10 bus wake-ups have occurred afterTerminal 30F reset. 

• Unexplained bus activity afterTerminal 30F reset. 

• Violation of closed-circuit current limit detected afterTerminal 30F reset.

The Junction box module controls the bistable relays for Terminal 30F but receives the 
request from the central gateway module (ZGM) or IBS. 

• ZGM: If sleep mode inhibited or on occurrence of unauthorized wake-up. 

ZGM monitors the vehicle status and registers inhibited sleep mode or 
unauthorized wake-up after Terminal 30B is switched off. 

• IBS: If closed-circuit current limit violated or starting capacity limit reached. 

The computation for activating the Terminal 30F relay takes place on two control units. 
The ZGM monitors the following activities: 

• Invalid wake-up procedures within the bus systems. 

• Sleep blockers (control units that constantly keep the bus systems active). 

The ECM (DME) continuously reads and assesses the battery data. The relay is also 
switched off when the starting capability limit of the vehicle battery is reached. 

The Terminal 30F relay is a bistable relay and is always in the ON state under normal con¬ 
ditions. It switches off the connected electric loads only in the case of fault. Once the 
Terminal 30F relay has been switched off, one of the switch-on conditions must be met 
before it can be switched on again. 

Note: More information on this topic can be found in the Reference Information 
on the CAS.
