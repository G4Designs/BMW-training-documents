One of the main purposes of the ECM is Ignition Management which includes the actu¬ 
ation of several components. In the following pages you will find a generic explanation 
on how this system works. For more detailed information please access BMW Training 
Reference Manuals found on-line. 

Principle of Operation 

Ignition Management provides ignition to the combustion chambers with the required 
voltage at the correct time. Based on the combination of inputs, the ECM calculates and 
controls the ignition timing and secondary output voltage by regulating the activation 
and dwell of the primary ignition circuits. The ECM controls and monitors the secondary 
ignition output including Misfire Detection. 

The ECM has a very “broad” range of ignition timing. This is possible by using a Direct 
Ignition System, or sometimes referred to as “Static Ignition System” (RZV). Reliability is 
also increased by having separate individual ignition circuits. 

The Ignition Control is determined by the ECM (load dependent). The ECM will calcu¬ 
late the engine “load” based on a combination of the following inputs: 

• Battery Voltage; 

• Accelerator Pedal Position; 

• Air Flow Volume; 

• Air Temperature; 

• Engine Coolant Temperature; 

• Crankshaft Position / RPM; 

• Camshaft Positions (Cylinder ID); 

• Knock Sensors; 

• *ln a Turbocharged engine, Boost Pressure is also used.

Ignition Management 

















The dwell time will be regulated based on battery voltage. When cranking, the voltage is 
low and the ECM will increase the dwell to compensate for saturation “lag time”. When 
the engine is running and the battery voltage is higher, the ECM will decrease the dwell 
due to faster saturation time. 

The Crankshaft Position/RPM signals the ECM to start ignition in firing order as well 
as providing information about the engine operation. This input is used in combination 
with other inputs to determine engine load which advances/retards the ignition tim¬ 
ing. Without this input, the ECM will not activate the ignition. 

Cold start is determined by the ECM based on the engine coolant temperature and rpm 
during start up. A cold engine will crank over slower than a warm engine, the ignition tim¬ 
ing will range between top dead center to slightly retarded providing optimum starting. 

When starting a warm engine, the rpm is higher which results in slightly advanced timing. 

If the engine coolant and intake air temperature is hot, the ignition timing will not be 
advanced reducing starter motor “load”. 

Ignition System Inputs 

The ignition system on the engine management system uses several inputs to control 
ignition functions. Proper ignition timing control is dependent upon inputs such as RPM, 
throttle position, crankshaft position, air mass and temperature (coolant and intake air) 
and in our turbocharged engines, intake boost pressure. 

Most of the ignition system components have remained the same for all NG6 engines. 
There are some minor changes to the ignition coils that apply to all versions. The coils 
have been optimized for more durability. 


Ignition Coils 


The high voltage supply required to ignite the mixture in the combustion chambers is 
determined by the stored energy in the ignition coils. The stored energy contributes to 
the ignition duration, ignition current and rate of high voltage increase. The Coil circuit 
including primary and secondary components consists of: 


The Coil Assembly contains two copper 
windings insulated from each other. One 
winding is the primary winding, formed by 
a few turns of thick wire. The secondary 
winding is formed by a great many turns 
of thin wire. 



4 

Ignition Management 










The primary winding receives battery voltage 
from the Ignition Coil Relay (in the IVM) which 
is activated by the CAS Module. The ECM pro¬ 
vides a ground path for the primary coil (Coil 
Terminal 1) by activating a Final Stage transis¬ 
tor. The length of time that current flows 
through the primary winding is the “dwell” 
which allows the coil to “saturate” or build up a 
magnetic field. After this storage process, the 
ECM will interrupt the primary circuit at the 
point of ignition by deactivating the Final Stage 
transistor. The magnetic field built up within the 
primary winding collapses and induces the ignition 
voltage in the secondary winding. 

The high voltage generated in the secondary 
winding is discharged through Coil Terminal 4 to 
the spark plug (insulated by the boot connector).

The primary and secondary windings are un-cou-

The ECM uses “pencil type” ignition coils. The individual ignition coils are integrated with 
the insulated connector (boot). 


The coils are removed by lifting the swivel latch connector retainer to release the wiring 
harness, apply a slight twist and lift the assembly upwards. The primary ignition cables 
are routed on the top of the cylinder head covers.

Ignition Management 












































































Spark Plugs 

The spark plugs introduce the ignition energy into the combustion 
chamber. The high voltage “arcs” across the air gap in the spark 
plug from the positive electrode to the negative electrodes. This 
creates a spark which ignites the combustible air/fuel mixture. 

The spark plugs are located in the center of the combustion area 
(on the top of the cylinder heads) which is the most suitable point 
for igniting the compressed air/fuel mixture. 

The spark plugs used on BMW Engines are designed by NGK. The plugs use an Iridium 
center electrode. The center electrode is only 0.6 mm thick. The insulator is also 
redesigned. The new spark plug technology allows for longer service life and improved 
cold starting. The correct spark plug for each engine should be used. 

The Ignition System is monitored by the ECM via the Crankshaft Position/RPM 
Sensor. If a Misfire fault is present, the ECM will deactivate the corresponding fuel injec¬ 
tor for that cylinder. Engine operation will still be possible. 

The spark plugs for the N51 and N52KP remain the same as N52. However, the N54 
uses a completely new spark plug from Bosch. The spark plug design consists of a 
12mm thread which contrasts from the 14mm design on the N52 which prevents any 
possibility of improper installation. The hex on the spark plug is also a 12 point design 
which requires a special tool. The tool (socket) has a “thinwall” design to facilitate 
access in the confined area of the N54 cylinder head. 





Iridium is a precious metal that is 6 
times harder and 8 times stronger 
than platinum, it has a 1,200° F higher 
melting point than platinum and con¬ 
ducts electricity better.

Knock Sensors 

The knock sensor registers structure-borne vibrations 
(knocking). Knocking combustion can damage the 
engine. The data from the knock sensor make it possible 
for the DME to implement countermeasures. Abnormal, 
reverberating combustion processes can occur under 
certain conditions in petrol engines. These abnormal 
combustion processes curtail the earliest possible igni¬ 
tion timing point and therefore limit the power output 
and efficiency of the engine. 

Such combustion processes are referred to as knocking and occur as the result of self 
ignition of the fuel-air mixture not yet reached by the flame front. Normal combustion and 
compression produced by the piston cause pressure and temperature to rise, resulting in 
self-ignition of the fuel-air mixture not yet ignited. This produces flame velocities in 
excess of 2000 m/s while the flame speed during normal combustion is approx. 30 m/s. 

Conditions favoring knocking operation include: 

• Increased compression ratio (e.g. deposits) 

• High cylinder charge 

• Poor fuel quality (RON/MON) 

• High intake air and engine temperature 

The knock sensors operate on the piezo electric principle. Vibrations from combustion 
events are converted into electrical signals which are monitored by the ECM. Excessive 
vibration indicates engine knock which will cause the ECM to retard the ignition timing to 
retard as necessary. 

The number of Knock sensors will vary depending on the engine; typically 6 cylinder 
engines use two (2), V8’s four (4) and V12’s six (6). 

Note: Excessive knocking will cause the MIL to illuminate. 

When installing knock sensors, be sure to torque to specification. 
Under or over-tightening the knock sensors can result is erroneous 
knock sensor faults or poor engine performance. 

If a fault is detected with the sensor(s), the ECM deactivates Knock 
Control and it will set the ignition timing to a conservative basic set¬ 
ting based on intake air temperature/pressure and a fault will be 
stored.

Ignition Management 



Superknocking 

The term superknocking refers to irregular combustion that occurs in 
turbocharged/supercharged engines. During this process, the maximum combustion 
pressure increases from approx. 100 bar up to about 200 bar. This situation could be 
caused by foreign bodies in the combustion chamber such as oil, residual gas or carbon 
particles that trigger ignition of the fuel-air mixture before the actual firing point. 

Superknocking cannot be eliminated by corresponding interventions in the ignition sys¬ 
tem so to prevent engine damage, the ECM reduces the power output when it detects 
superknocking. Temporary superknocking is caused by individual dirt particles. Fuel 
injection into the affected cylinder is shut down in the short term (3 to 6 cycles) in 
response to superknocking. A corresponding fault code is stored in the fault code 
memory. 



8 

Ignition Management 


Multiple Ignition Pulses 

Multiple Ignition Pulses ensure good spark quality during engine start up. The ECM will 
activate the ignition coils 9 times (voltage dependent) per 720° of crankshaft revolution. 

The ignition timing will be progressively 
advanced assisting the engine in coming 
up to speed. As the engine speed 
approaches idle rpm, the timing remains 
slightly advanced to boost torque. When 
the engine is at idle speed, minimum tim¬ 
ing advance is required. This will allow 
faster engine and catalyst warm up. 

The multiple pulsing switches to single 
pulse when: 

• Engine Speed >1350 RPM (varied 
with engine temperature) 

The timing will be advanced when the ECM observes low engine rpm and increasing 
throttle/air volume inputs (acceleration torque). As the throttle is opened, the ECM 
advances the timing based on engine acceleration and at what rate. The ECM will fully 
advance timing for the “full throttle” position indicating maximum acceleration (torque).

Crankshaft Position/RPM Sensor (Hall 
Effect) 

The crankshaft position sensor provides the ECM with a 
5 volt square wave signal. The ECM calculates engine 
speed (RPM) and crankshaft position for ignition and 
injection system operation. 

The sensor is supplied with 12 volts from the engine 
electronics fuses and ground from the ECM. 

An effective signal that can be evaluated is output as 
from a speed of approx. 20 rpm. 

The control unit detects the tooth gap in that the measured spacing of the gaps is more 
than double as great as the previous or subsequent gaps. The tooth gap itself is 
assigned to a defined crankshaft position of cylinder number 1. The DME synchronizes 
the crankshaft position with respect to this timing point. With each subsequent low signal 
it increments the crankshaft position by 6°. 

Exact assignment is necessary for the DME to be able to adapt the ignition and fuel 
injection to specific requirements. The time interval measured between two level 
changes (e.g. High to Low) is therefore divided into smaller units of time.

Service Information 


A fault survey should first be performed using the IMIB to determine if there is a fault in 
the primary ignition or secondary ignition. If there is a fault in the primary ignition, testing 
should include: 

• Power Supply at the coil (KL 15). 

• Resistance of the harness and ignition coil primary winding using the Universal 
Adapter with the ECM disconnected. 

If there is a fault in the secondary ignition, testing should include: 

• Primary Ignition. 

• Evaluation of Secondary Oscilloscope Patterns. 





The Following are Examples of 
Secondary Oscilloscope Patterns 

(consult Repair Instructions for ignition 
pattern variations per coil manufacturer): 

This is a normal pattern for one ignition circuit 
with the engine at idle speed. 

• Normal Combustion Period. 

• Normal Ignition Voltage Peak.

W127CSQ 



The ignition current circuit is monitored based on the current in the primary coil. When 
switching on, the current must be within certain values during defined time thresholds. 

The following items are monitored: 

• Primary current circuit of ignition coil. 

• Ignition wiring harness. 

• Secondary current circuit of ignition coil with spark plug. 

• Spark duration. 

The following defects are detected by the ignition circuit monitoring: 

• Short-circuit on primary side of ignition coil. 

• Spark plug. 

• Line break in ignition wiring harness. 

• Defective ignition output stages. 

The following are not detected: 

• Sporadic faults such as loose contacts in the ignition wiring harness. 

• Sparkover in the high voltage circuit parallel to the spark gap without producing 
an interturn fault. 


16 

Ignition Management 




















In Summary, 

If the Secondary Ignition Voltage is Too High (Excessive Resistance for Ignition): 

• Spark Plug Gap is to Large (Worn or Burned). 

• Incorrect Heat Range Spark Plug. 

• Compression is too High (Carbon, etc.). 

• Interruption in the Secondary Ignition Connector or Resistive Adapter Boot. 

If the Secondary Ignition Voltage is Too Low (Low Resistance for Ignition): 

• Spark Plug Gap is Too Small (Mishandled on Installation). 

• Incorrect Heat Range Spark Plug. 

• Compression is Too Low. 

• Voltage Leak in the Secondary Ignition Connector or Resistive Boot to Ground. 

Ignition Coils 

The ignition coils of BMW enignes have been redesigned for better rigidity and durability. 
Particular care must be taken when working on the fuel system to ensure that the igni¬ 
tion coils are not wet with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced 
by contact with fuel. This could compromise the coils insulation and result in arcking at 
the top of the spark plug causing a misfire. 

• The ignition coils must be removed before working on the fuel system. 

• When installing new solenoid valve fuel injectors utmost cleanliness must be 
observed. 

• After removing the ignition coils use a rag to prevent fuel from entering the spark 
plug well. 

• Ignition coils that have been saturated with fuel must be replaced.

Knock Control 


Knock Control allows the ECM to further 
advance the ignition timing under load for 
increased torque. Knock Control is only in 
affect when the engine temperature is 
greater than 35°C and there is a load on 
the engine. This will disregard false signals 
while idling or from a cold engine. 

Based on the firing order, the ECM moni¬ 
tors the Knock Sensors after each ignition 
for a normal (low) signal.

If the signal value exceeds the threshold, 

the ECM identifies the “knock” and retards the ignition timing (3°) for that cylinder the 
next time it is fired. This process is repeated in 3° increments until the knock ceases. 


The ignition timing will be advanced again in increments to just below the knock limit and 
maintain the timing at that point. 

If a fault is detected with the Knock Sensor(s) or circuits, the ECM deactivates Knock 
Control. The ignition timing will be set to a conservative basic setting (to reduce the risk 
of detonation) and a fault will be stored. The “Malfunction Indicator Light” will be illumi¬ 
nated when the OBDII criteria is achieved. 


The Knock Sensors should be tested using the IMIB for: 
• Fault Codes 


• Status Display - Knock Control (active / not active) 

• Oscilloscope Display (Low AC Voltage -mV setting) 

When installing Knock Sensors: 

• Do not mix the locations! or Engine 
Damage will result! The Knock Sensors 
use a combined connection to the engine 
harness. The Knock Sensor with the 
shorter cable is for cylinders 4-6. 

• Do not over tighten attaching bolt! - 

Piezo ceramic will be cracked. Torque to 
20 nm. 

• Do not under tighten attaching bolt! 

A lose sensor can vibrate producing a 
similar signal to a knock. 



18 

Ignition Management 




















































Conditions favoring knocking operation include: 

• Elevated compression ratio. 

• High cylinder charge. 

• Poor fuel quality (RON/MON). 

• High intake air and engine temperature. 

Self-diagnosis of the knock control system comprises the following checks: 

• Check for signal error, e.g. line break or plug connection defective. 

• Self-test of evaluator circuit. 

• Check of noise level registered by the knock sensor for the engine. 

Knock control is switched off if an error is determined in one of these checks. In this 
case, an emergency program controls the ignition timing. At the same time, a corre¬ 
sponding fault code is entered in the fault code memory. The emergency program 
ensures safe, damage-free operation. The emergency program depends on the load, 
engine speed and engine temperature.

Spark Plugs 

The Spark Plugs should be inspected for the 
proper type, gap and replaced at the specified 
intervals. 

Refer to the Service Information Bulletins: 

• SI B 12 01 05 High Performance Iridium 
Spark Plug/Spark Plug Application Chart 

• SI B 12 01 99 High Performance Platinum 
Spark Plug/Spark Plug Application Chart 
for the proper type and a visual of the 
spark plug (showing effects of combus¬

The Spark Plugs should be properly installed and torqued using the following Special 
Tools: 

• SWZ 12 1 200 Torque Limiter 

• SWZ 12 1 171 Spark Plug Socket 




Never use Air Tools for removal or installation.

Spark Plug Diagnosis (HPI engines) 

Due to the proximity of the spark plug to the fuel injector nozzle, any divergence in the 
fuel spray may cause possible spark plug damage. This makes spark plug diagnosis an 
important part of HPI engine service concerns. Information gained by the spark plug 
diagnosis may indicate possible fuel injector faults. Spark plug replacement interval has 
been reduced to 45,000 miles on this engines. The illustrations below can be used to 
assist in spark plug diagnosis: 



The spark plug above shows a normal wear pattern 
with no excessive electrode wear or insulator 
damage. 


The spark plug above shows a normal wear pattern 
for a spark plug with high mileage. Spark plug is

When diagnosing a Misfire fault code, Remember: 

“Misfire” is caused by a defect in the internal combustion engine or a defect in 
the control of the engine operation. 

“Misfire” is the result of improper combustion (variation between cylinders) as 
measured at the crankshaft due to: 

- Engine mechanical defects; breakage, wear, leakage or improper tolerances. 

- Excessive mixture deviation; air (vacuum leaks), fuel and all the components that deliver 
air/fuel into the combustion chambers. 

- Faulty ignition; primary, secondary including spark plugs. 

- Faulty exhaust flow; affecting back pressure. 

- Tolerance parameters; ECM programming. 

A Misfire fault code(s) is the “symptom” of a faulty input for proper combustion. 
When diagnosing a misfire, review the charts to assist you in finding the faulty 
input.

^Submit TC case for injector replacement. 

> If only one misfire occurs per bank -> Replace 
just one injector 

> If more than one misfire occurs in the same bank 
-> Replace all 3 injectors of that bank; 

> If three or more cylinders misfire -^Replace all 6 
injectors 



^Submit TC case for injector replacement. Determine the 
cylinder affected by misfire (see misfire fault code) and 
Environmental conditions 

Note: 

* If only one cylinder with misfire occurs per bank -> 
Replace just one injector 

* If more than one Cylinder with misfire occurs in the same 
bank Check misfire frequencys (Environmental 
Conditions) -> Replace the injector with the highest 
frequency of misfires per bank 


Replace ignition coil 

and spark plug 
accordingly 


When replacing injectors, make sure that: 

* Injector calibration is done (follow SIB 12 26 08) 

* Clear all DME adaptations

In case of this leaking injector symptom, make sure 
that: 

* Check DME 1-Level go to No. 4
