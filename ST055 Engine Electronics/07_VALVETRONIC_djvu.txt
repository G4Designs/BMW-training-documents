VALVETRONIC 


Introduction 

With the introduction of the N52, the 6-cylinder engine incorporated the load control 
system based on the valve timing gear (VALVETRONIC II). The VALVETRONIC I sys¬ 
tem that was used on the 8 (N62) and 12 (N73) cylinder engines already achieved a sub¬ 
stantial increase in efficiency. 



BMW has further developed this concept with the VALVETRONIC II. 
The results of this further development are: 

• Increased engine dynamics 

• Increased efficiency 

• Improved emission values

These results underscore BMW specific standards. As an example of VALVETRONIC II, 
the N52 engine features the following optimizations which further enhances the Ultimate 
Driving Machine: 

• The top engine speed has been increased to 7,000 rpm. 

• The specific power output has been increased to 63.4 kW/l. 

• The specific engine torque is 100 Nm/I over a broad engine speed range. 

• Distinctly increased valve acceleration values and friction-optimized transmission 
elements result in an even more responsive engine. 

• CO emissions reduced. 

• The world's most stringent exhaust emission regulations are complied with.

The illustration on the left shows the conventional method with the slightly higher loss. 
The reduced loss can be clearly seen in the illustration on the right. The upper area 
represents the power gained from the combustion process in the petrol engine. The 
lower area illustrates the loss in this process. 

The loss area can be equated to the charge cycle, relating to the amount of energy that 
must be applied in order to expel the combusted exhaust gasses from the cylinder and 
then to draw the fresh gasses again into the cylinder.

VALVETRONIC 



















Apart from the full load setting, the intake of fresh gasses in a throttle valve controlled 
engine always takes place against the resistance offered by the throttle valve to the 
inflowing gasses. The throttle valve is virtually always fully opened during intake on the 
VALVETRONIC controlled engine. The load is controlled by the closing timing of the 
valve. 

Compared to the conventional engine where the load is controlled by the throttle valve, 
no vacuum occurs in the intake manifold. This means no energy is expended for the 
purpose of producing the vacuum. The improved efficiency is achieved by the lower 
power loss during the intake process. 

A minimum vacuum in the intake system is reguired for the crankcase ventilation and 
evaporative purge systems. The throttle valve is slightly adjusted for this purpose. 

Function 

The VALVETRONIC II consists of the fully variable valve lift control combined with the 
variable camshaft control (double VANOS). The valve lift is controlled only on the intake 
side while the camshaft (VANOS) is adjusted also on the exhaust side. 

The throttle-free load control is implemented by: 

• variable valve lift of the intake valve, 

• variable valve opening timing of the intake valve and 

• variable camshaft spread of the intake and exhaust camshaft. 

System optimization includes modification of the valve gear kinematics, a modified actu¬ 
ator motor and the adapted spread range of the VANOS units. 

The main differences are: 

• The plain bearing on the intermediate lever to the eccentric shaft has been replaced 
by a roller bearing, thus reducing the friction in the valve timing gear. 

• Guidance of the intermediate lever is more precise. Only one spring is now reguired 
to guide and hold the intermediate lever. 

• The moved mass of the valve timing gear has been reduced by 13%. 

• The lift range of the intake valves has been improved. The maximum lift has been 
increased to 9.9 mm but more importantly the minimum lift has been further 
reduced to 0.18 mm. 

The overall result is supported by further improvements in the intake manifold and 
exhaust dynamics.

VALVETRONIC 























The fully variable valve lift control is activated with the aid of an actuator motor (1), an 
eccentric shaft (14), an intermediate lever (13), the return spring (3), the intake camshaft 
(5) and the roller cam follower (12). The actuator motor is installed in the cylinder head 
above the camshafts. It serves the purpose of adjusting the eccentric shaft. The worm 
shaft of the electric motor meshes with the worm gear mounted on the eccentric shaft. 
Following adjustment, the eccentric shaft does not have to be locked in position as the 
worm gear is sufficiently self-locking. The eccentric shaft adjusts the valve lift on the 
intake side. 

The intermediate lever varies the transmission ratio between the camshaft and the roller 
cam follower. The valve lift (9.9 mm) and opening time are at a maximum in the full load 
position. 

The valve lift (0.18 mm) and opening time are set to minimum in the idling position. The 
roller cam followers and the associated intermediate levers are divided into four classes. 
A corresponding code number is punched on the components. They always have the 
same class per pair. Assignment of the roller cam followers and the intermediate levers 
at the production plant ensures that the cylinders are uniformly charged even at the 
minimum valve lift of 0.18 mm.

Eccentric Shaft Sensor 

The eccentric shaft sensor (3) signals the position of the shaft back to the ECM. 

This sensor operates based on the magnetoresistive principle: A ferromagnetic conduc¬ 
tor changes its resistance when the applied magnetic field changes its position. 



For this purpose, a magnetic wheel (1) that contains a permanent magnet is mounted on 
the eccentric shaft. As the shaft rotates, the magnetic field lines of the magnet intersect 
the magnetically conductive material in the sensor. The resulting change in resistance is 
used as a correcting variable for the signal for the engine control unit. 

The magnetic wheel must be secured on the eccentric shaft by means of a non-mag- 
netic screw (2) otherwise the sensor will not function. 

VVT Motor and Relay 

The VVT motor is controlled directly by the ECM. The motor receives power from a 
relay located in the E-Box.

Phasing 

The new VALVETRONIC II, is a very fast and exact engine control system. So-called 
phasing is implemented to assist adjustment in the lower valve lift range. The intake 
valves of a cylinder are opened synchronously up to a lift of 0.2 mm. Valve 1 then 
begins to lead (advance). Therefore, valve 2 opens with a slight delay behind valve 1 and 
catches up to valve 1 again at a lift of approximately 6 mm. From here on they open 
synchronously again. 

This opening characteristic has a favorable effect on the inflow of gasses into the cylin¬ 
der. By keeping the opening cross section of the intake valves small this results in a dis¬ 
tinctly higher flow rate at a constant intake volume. In connection with the geometry in 
the upper area of the combustion chamber, this higher flow rate is used to mix the 
air/fuel mixture more effectively. 

This phasing eliminates the need for the turbulence ports used on the previous genera¬ 
tion six-cylinder engines. The phasing feature of the Valvetronic creates the necessary 
turbulence (swirl) in the combustion chamber. 

MIN/MAX Stops 

A stop routine can be implemented between the mechanical stops in order to detect the 
positions of the mechanical stops. For this purpose, the eccentric shaft is adjusted from 
zero lift to full lift. The stop routine is executed only when the motor electronics deter¬ 
mines implausible values during the engine start procedure. This routine can also be 
initiated by the diagnosis systems.

VALVETRONIC III 


The main differences between VALVETRONIC III and VALVETRONIC II are in the 
arrangement of the VALVETRONIC servomotor and the VALVETRONIC sensor. As in 
VALVETRONIC II, the turbulence level is increased at the end of the compression cycle 
for the purpose of optimizing the mixture formation with the use of phasing and masking 
measures. This movement of the cylinder charge improves the combustion during par¬ 
tial load operation and in catalytic converter heating mode. The guench areas also con¬ 
tribute to mixture formation. 

Phasing 

Phasing results in a lift difference between both intake valves of up to 1.8 mm in the 
lower partial load range. Conseguently, the flow of fresh air is distributed asymmetrically.

Masking 

Masking refers to the design of the valve seats. This machining ensures that the incom¬ 
ing fresh air is aligned in such a way as to give rise to the reguired cylinder charge 
movement. The advantage of this measure is that the combustion retardation is 
reduced by approximately 10° of crankshaft rotation. The combustion process takes 
place faster and a larger valve overlap can be achieved, thus considerably reducing NOx 
emissions.

Valve Lift Adjustment Overview 

As can be seen from the following graphic, the installation location of the servomotor has 
changed with VALVETRONIC III. Another new feature is that the eccentric shaft sensor 
is no longer mounted on the eccentric shaft but has been integrated into the servomo¬ 
tor.

VALVETRONIC Servomotor 

A brushless direct current motor (BLDC motor) is used. The BLCD motor is mainte¬ 
nance-free and very powerful, due to the contactless energy transfer system. The use of 
integrated electronic modules ensures precision control. 

The Valvetronic servomotor has the following special features: 

• Open concept (engine oil is directly supplied to the motor). 

• The eccentric shaft angle is determined by angle increments from the integrated 
sensor system. 

• Power consumption is reduced by about 50%. 

• Higher actuating dynamics (e.g. cylinder-selective adjustment, idle speed control, 
etc.). 

• Lightweight design is approximately 600 grams. 

Function 

Actuation of the Valvetronic servomotor is limited to a maximum of 40 amps. A maximum 
of 20 amps are available over a period of > 200 milliseconds. The Valvetronic servomotor 
is actuated by a pulse width modulated signal. The duty cycle is between 5% and 98%.
