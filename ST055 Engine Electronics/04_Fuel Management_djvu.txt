Principle of Operation 

One of the main purposes of the ECM is Fuel Management which includes the actua¬ 
tion of several components. In the following pages you will find a generic explanation on 
how this system works. For more detailed information please access BMW Training 
Reference Manuals found online. 

Fuel Management delivers fuel from the tank to the intake ports of the engine. 

To accomplish this, fuel supply must be available to the fuel injectors. Once this is 
accomplished, the fuel must be injected in the precise amount and at the correct time. 
The ECM does not directly monitor fuel supply, although it does control fuel supply. 

The Fuel Pump supplies fuel when it receives operating voltage from the Engine 
Control Module Relay supplying the Fuel Pump Relay. The ECM controls and 
monitors fuel injection. 

The Fuel Pump will be activated when the ignition (KL_15) is switched “on” and the 
ECM supplies a ground circuit to activate the Fuel Pump Relay. The Fuel Pump Relay 
supplies operating power to the in-tank mounted fuel pump. This is a momentary acti¬ 
vation to “pressurize” (prime) the fuel system. 

The ECM then requires an engine speed signal from the Crankshaft Position/RPM 
Sensor to maintain continuous Fuel Pump Relay activation. 

If the engine RPM signal is not present, the ECM will deactivate the Fuel Pump Relay. 

The Fuel Injectors will be opened by the ECM to inject pressurized fuel into the 
engine. The Fuel Injectors receive voltage from the Engine Control Module Relay. The 
ECM controls the opening by activating the ground circuits. The ECM will vary the dura¬ 
tion (in milli-seconds) of “opening” time to regulate the air/fuel ratio. 


5 

Fuel Management 























The ECM has the Final Stage output transis¬ 
tors that switch ground to the injectors. The 
Injector “triggering” is first established from 
the Crankshaft Position/RPM Sensor. 

The ECM is programmed to activate the Final 
Stage output transistors once for every two 
revolutions of the crankshaft, in two groups 
(Semi-Sequential Injection). 

The injectors are opened in two groups for 
every complete “working cycle” of the engine. 
This delivers the fuel charge for cylinders 1,5,3 
during one revolution of the crankshaft and 
cylinders 6,2,4 during the second revolution of 
the crankshaft. This process enhances fuel 
atomization during start up. 



During start up, the ECM recognizes the 
Camshaft Position (Cylinder ID) input. The 
camshaft position is referenced to the crank¬ 
shaft position. It then switches the injection to 
Full Sequential. This process “times” the 
injection closer to the intake valve opening for 
increased efficiency. 

When activated, each injector delivers the full 
fuel charge at separate times during each 
engine working cycle. 



= FUEL INJECTED I I = INTAKE VALVE(S) OPEN 



If this input is faulty, the ECM 
will activate the injectors in 
Parallel to maintain engine 
operation and set a fault code.

Fuel Management 








































































After the engine has been started, the ECM determines the Injector “open” time to 
maintain engine operation. The ECM will calculate the injection “timing” based on a 
combination of the following inputs. 


• Battery Voltage 

• Throttle Position 

• Air Flow Volume/Mass 

• Air Temperature 

• Crankshaft Position/RPM 

• Camshaft Position (Cylinder ID) 

• Engine Coolant 

• Oxygen Sensor 

Additionally in turbocharged 
engines the ECM also employs: 

• Boost Pressure Sensor. 

• Charge Air Pressure and 
Temperature Sensor (Before 
EDK). 

• Intake Manifold Pressure 
Sensor (After EDK). 



The injection millisecond (ms) value will be regulated based on battery voltage. When 
cranking, the voltage is low and the ECM will increase the ms value to compensate for 
injector “lag time”. When the engine is running and the battery voltage is higher, the 
ECM will decrease the injection ms value due to faster injector reaction time. 

Cold starting requires additional fuel to compensate for poor mixture and the loss of fuel 
as it condenses onto cold intake ports, valves and cylinder walls . The cold start fuel 
quantity is determined by the ECM based on the Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor 
input during start up. 

During cranking, additional fuel is injected (in Semi-Sequential) for the first few crank¬ 
shaft revolutions. After the first few crankshaft revolutions, the injected quantity is 
metered down as the engine comes up to speed. When the engine speed approaches 
idle rpm, the ECM recognizes the Camshaft Position and switches to Full Sequential 
injection. 

When the engine is cold, optimum fuel metering is not possible due to poor air/fuel mix¬ 
ing and an enriched mixture is required. The Coolant Temperature input allows the ECM 
to adjust the injection “ms” value to compensate during warm up and minimize the 
injected fuel at engine operating temperature. 


7 

Fuel Management 






























When the engine is at idle, minimum injection is required. Additional fuel will be added if 
the ECM observes low engine rpm and increasing throttle/air volume inputs (acceleration 
enrichment). As the throttle is opened, the ECM monitors acceleration and rate of move¬ 
ment. The ECM will increase the volume of injected fuel into the engine by increasing 
the injection “ms” value. The “full throttle” position indicates maximum acceleration and 
the ECM will add more fuel (full load enrichment). 

As the throttle is closed, the ECM decreases the injection “ms” value (fuel shut off) if the 
rpm is above idle speed (coasting). This feature decreases fuel consumption and lowers 
emissions. When the engine rpm approaches idle speed, the injection “ms” value is 
increased (cut-in) to prevent the engine from stalling. The cut-in rpm is dependent upon 
the engine temperature and the rate of deceleration. 

The Hot-Film Air Mass (HEM) signal provides the measured amount of intake air vol¬ 
ume/mass. This input is used by the ECM to determine the amount of fuel to be injected 
to “balance” the air/fuel ratio. 


The Air Temperature Signal allows the ECM to make an additional calculation of air den¬ 
sity. The varying voltage input from the NTC sensor indicates the larger proportion of 
oxygen found in cold air, as compared to less oxygen found in warmer air. The ECM will 
adjust the amount of injected fuel because the quality of combustion depends on oxygen 
sensing ratio. 


The Crankshaft Position/RPM signals the ECM to start injection as well as providing 
information about the engine operation. This input is used in combination with other 
inputs to determine engine load which increases/decreases the injection “ms” value. 
Without this input the ECM will not activate the injectors. 


The Camshaft Position (Cylinder ID) affects the 
injection timing (Semi-Sequential/Full 
Sequential). To accomplish this, the ECM con¬ 
tains six Final Stage output transistors that acti¬ 
vate the injectors individually. The engine oper¬ 
ates sufficiently on Semi-Sequential Injection 
(two groups of three), but more efficiently on 
Full Sequential Injection (six individual). If one of 
the fuel injector circuits faulted, the engine can 
still operate on limited power from the other 
remaining fuel injector circuits.

Fuel Management 
















The ECM will selectively deactivate injectors to 
control maximum engine rpm (regardless of 
vehicle speed). When the engine speed reach¬ 
es its “redline”, the injectors will be individually 
deactivated as required to protect the engine 
from over-rev. As the engine speed drops 
below “redline”, injector activation will be 
resumed. This feature does not protect the 
engine from a forced over-rev situation such as 
improperly downshifting a manual transmission 
equipped vehicle (driver error). 

The ECM will also protect the Catalytic 
Converter by deactivating the injectors. 

If the ECM detects a “misfire” (ignition, injection 
or combustion) it can selectively deactivate the 
Final Stage output transistor for that cylinder(s). 

The injector(s) will not open, preventing 
unburned fuel from entering the exhaust sys¬ 
tem. 

The ECM controls the individual injector circuits 
resulting in deactivation of one or multiples. 

This will limit engine power, but protect the 
Catalytic Converter.

Maximum vehicle speed is also limited by the ECM selectively 
deactivating the injectors (regardless of engine rpm). 


This limitation is based on the vehicle dimensions, specifications 
and installed tires (speed rating).

Fuel Management 


























































The ECM (DME) is connected to the EKP module via the PT-CAN network via a pulse 
width modulated (PWM) signal according to the fuel quantity required by the ECM. The 
electric fuel pump in the EKP system is activated as required. The DME calculates the 
amount of fuel required at the given point in time. The total volume required is transmit¬ 
ted as a message to the EKP control unit via PT-CAN. 

The EKP control unit controls the electric fuel pump on the basis of mappings so that 
the electric fuel pump delivers the exact amount of fuel required. 

The EKP control unit converts this message into an output voltage. This output voltage 
is then used to control the speed of the electric fuel pump. This achieves a delivery 
which corresponds with the requirements. 

The illustrations shown below are from an E90 and an F10. The EKP module on the E90 
contains one of the terminating resistors for the PT-CAN.

Fuel Requirement Mappings 

Fuel requirement mappings are stored in the EKP control unit. The fuel requirement 
mappings are encoded for each specific engine and model. The EKP control unit uses 
the mappings as the basis on which to calculate the total amount of fuel to be delivered 
from the following variable: 

• Amount of fuel required by the engine (request from the ECM). This results in a 
pulse-width modulated output voltage from the EKP control unit. The output volt¬ 
age of the EKP control unit is the supply voltage for the electric fuel pump. The 
EKP control unit controls the speed of the electric fuel pump via the supply voltage. 
The EKP control unit controls the speed by comparing the actual speed with the 
specification. 


10 

Fuel Management 

























































Speed of the Electric Fuel Pump 

The EKP control unit sends the current supply to the fuel pump (pulse-width modulat¬ 
ed). This voltage is absorbed as a specific ripple due to the individual armature windings 
of the rotating electric motor. The ripple corresponds with the number of segments in 
the commutator which corresponds with the number of armature windings in the electric 
motor. 

The number of waves produced per revolution is equal to the number of existing com¬ 
mutator segments. 

This means that the EKP control unit can employ a patented procedure - "Ripple 
Counter" as the basis for calculating the actual speed of the fuel pump using power 
consumption ripple. 

Coding and Programming 

The data for the electronically controlled fuel pump system is encoded as follows: 

• In the ECM (DME), the engine and model-related characteristic curves for fuel 
delivery according to requirements. 

• In the EKP control unit: specific characteristic curves for the relevant fuel system 



Failsafe Operation 

If the fuel quantity requirement from the ECM and/or the EKP rotation 
speed signal fails, the fuel pump will continue to operate with the 
greatest delivery rate (100%) when terminal KL_15 is activated. This 
guarantees fuel supply even if the control signals fail. 


Fuel Injection Control Monitoring 

Fuel Injection Control Monitoring is performed 
by the ECM for OBD II requirements. Faults 
with the fuel injectors and/or control circuits 
will be stored in memory. This monitoring 
includes: 

• Closed Loop Operation 

• Oxygen Sensor Feedback 


When the criteria for OBD II monitoring is ach¬ 
ieved, the “Malfunction Indicator Light” will be 
illuminated. 



These additional corrections are factored into 
the calculated injection time. If the correction 
factor exceeds set limits a fault will be stored in 
memory.

Fuel Management 








Fuel Supply 

The fuel is delivered from the fuel tank to the engine in the following sequence: 

• From the right half of the fuel tank; 

• through the initial filler valve (11); 

• into the fuel baffle (12); 

• from the electric fuel pump (1); 

• via a T-piece, on the one side, through the check valve (3) into the fuel filter (4); 

• through the feed line (5) in the left-hand service opening to the engine; 

• and, on the other side, via the check valve (8) to the left-hand suction jet pump (9) 
back into the fuel baffle; 

• parallel from the electric fuel pump to the right-hand suction jet pump (10); 

• and from the right half of the fuel tank into the fuel baffle. 

The fuel filter (4) and pressure regulator (7) are located at the left-hand service opening. 
The check valve (8) opens at a fuel pressure above 2.5 bar. It ensures the engine 
receives sufficient fuel before the left suction jet pump cuts into the circuit. 

As an example, on the N52 engine the pressure regulator (7) routes the fuel back into 
the fuel baffle (12). A 5 bar pressure regulator is used for vehicles with the N52 engine.

N55 Engine 

■ Fuel supply system 

The fuel pressure sensor sends a voltage signal, corresponding to the system pressure 
applied between the fuel pump and the high pressure pump, to the engine control unit 
(DME/ECM). The system pressure (fuel pressure) is determined with the fuel 
pressure sensor upstream of the high pressure pump. The target pressure is constantly 
compared to the actual pressure in the DME. 

If the target pressure deviates from the actual pressure, the engine control unit increases 
or decreases the voltage for the electric fuel pump. This voltage is sent in the form of a 
message via the PT-CAN to the EKP control unit. 

The electric fuel pump (EKP) control unit converts the message into an output voltage 
for the electric fuel pump, thus regulating the required delivery pressure for the engine 
(or high pressure pump). The electric fuel pump is pilot-controlled in the event of signal 
failure (fuel pressure sensor). Should the CAN bus fail the EKP control unit operates the 
electric fuel pump with the applied system voltage. The fuel flows via the high pressure 
line to the fuel rail. The fuel is buffered in the fuel rail and distributed to the fuel injectors. 

■ Fuel quantity control 

The rail pressure sensor measures the current fuel pressure in the rail. The excess fuel is 
returned to the inlet of the high pressure pump when the quantity control valve in the 
high pressure pump opens. Vehicle operation is restricted in the event of the high pres¬ 
sure pump failing. 

The quantity control valve controls the fuel pressure in the rail. The engine management 
actuates the quantity control valve with a pulse width-modulated signal. Depending on 
the pulse width, a variable throttle cross section is released, thus providing the quantity 
of fuel required for the current load status of the engine. It is also possible to reduce the 
pressure in the rail. 

N63 Engine 

The fuel system on the F01/02 has gone under some design changes as compared to 
previous models. The familiar fuel tank with divided chambers is still in use. The familiar 
configuration which features the fuel pump on the right (passenger) side is also retained. 

■ Fuel Supply System 

In order to comply with the regulations regarding evaporative 

emissions, there have been several changes to internal fuel tank components as well as 
the fuel tank itself. 


14 

Fuel Management 



The fuel supply system has also been modified to eliminate the fuel pressure regulator. 
The following text summarizes the 
changes to the fuel supply system: 

• the fuel supply system is now “pressure controlled”. 

• the fuel pressure regulator has been replaced by the 
“pressure limiting valve” (8). 

• the pressure in the fuel supply system is limited to a maximum of 5.8 bar by 
the pressure limiting valve (8). 

• the EKPS will control the fuel pump in order to deliver only the amount of fuel 
required based on information from the fuel pressure sensor (low pressure). 

Due to the nature of the installation space in the vehicle, the fuel tank is divided into two 
chambers. The fuel supply system has two delivery units that are accommodated in the 
right and left fuel tank halves. 

In the event of the surge chamber being completely empty, initial fill valve (1) enables 
fuel to enter the surge chamber during the refueling process.

N63 System Overview 

Fuel passes through suction strainer (2) and enters fuel pump (3) and is then pumped to 
feed line (9) through fuel filter (4). The fuel pump resides in the surge chamber. 

A pressure limiting valve (8) is integrated into the feed line in the fuel tank. 

Fuel tank on F01 with N63 engine 



For the first time for a gasoline engine, we are no longer using a pressure regulator. 
Instead, operation of the electric fuel pump is pressure-regulated. In response to the 
signal from the low-pressure fuel sensor, the speed of the electric fuel pump is adjusted 
to achieve the desired delivery pressure upstream of the high-pressure pump. 

A further line branches off downstream of the fuel pump into the left half of the fuel tank 
and carries fuel from the left half into the surge chamber by way of a non-return valve (5) 
and suction jet pump (6).

The non-return valve (5) prevents fuel from flowing back from the right half to the left half 
of the fuel tank while the engine is switched off. 

When you switch off the engine, the feed line is depressurized but cannot run dry 
because, with the system being airtight, no air is able to enter the line. Anti-leak valve (7) 
prevents the fuel tank from leaking in the event of damage to the lines on the engine or 
underbody. 

A further line en route to the left half of the fuel tank branches off to another suction jet 
pump (11), which sucks fuel out of the fuel trap and delivers it to the surge chamber. 

Another line exits the pump carrying fuel pumped from the fuel tank to the surge 
chamber by suction jet pump (10).

Fuel filler cap (A) has an integral pressure relief valve (B) to the protect fuel tank (E) from 
excess pressure. At the end of the fuel filler neck, there is a non-return flap with a pres¬ 
sure relief valve (C). The non-return flap prevents fuel from sloshing back into the fuel 
filler neck. The non-return flap is sealed closed by a spring. In the event of a build-up of 
pressure in the fuel tank, the pressure relief valve in the non-return flap ensures that the 
excess pressure can escape through the fuel filler pipe and out of the fuel filler cap 
through the pressure relief valve. 

The components in the fuel tank are accessible through the service cover (F). The fuel 
level is detected by the two lever-type sensors (G). 

The surge chamber (D) ensures that the fuel pump never pumps dry. The surge 
chamber is permanently connected to the fuel tank and cannot be replaced separately. 

The F01/F02 has a whole range of breather valves in the fuel tank. In principle, all of 
these valves fulfil the breather function, both during vehicle operation and during 
refueling. 

Despite this, they are named to reflect their main purpose. They are therefore divided 
into filler valves and service breather valves. The service breather valves have a smaller 
opening, which means that, during refueling, they alone would not be able to let air 
escape from the fuel tank fast enough. There are service breather valves with and with¬ 
out over fueling protection. 

The service breather valves are arranged in such a way that air can still be released even 
if the vehicle is parked up on one side. 

The filler breather valve is located at a high position. If the fuel level rises to this height 
during refueling, the valve closes. Air can no longer escape from the fuel tank fast 
enough, which causes fuel to rise up the filler pipe and switch off the fuel nozzle. 

To enable the release of air to continue, there is a service breather valve located at the 
highest point. However, the presence of the valve in this location means that the fuel 
tank could be overfilled in the event of persistent refueling. Consequently, fuel would 
enter the activated charcoal filter and ultimately flow back out of the opening. To pre¬ 
vent this, the highest service breather valve is equipped with over fueling protection like 
the one on the left-hand side of the vehicle (as a safeguard if the vehicle were parked up 
on one side). 

Fuel that is carried along with the release of air is collected in a fuel trap and pumped 
back into the surge chamber.

Fuel filler pipe 


The non-return flap forms a tight seal. A force of approximately 0.15 N is required to 
open the non-return flap. This force is slightly exceeded during any type of refueling. 

The non-return flap on the F01 is equipped with a pressure relief valve. The purpose of 
this pressure relief valve is to prevent excessive pressures from building up in the fuel 
tank. If the pressure in the fuel tank rises to over 150 mbar, the pressure relief valve 
opens and the pressure is able to escape through the fuel filler pipe and the breather 
line/pressure relief valve in the fuel cap. 

The pressure relief valve in the non-return flap on the F01 is a new concept because the 
breather line is not protected by the body along its entire length. In the event of an acci¬ 
dent, therefore, the breather line could be squeezed closed. 

Filler Breather Valve 

The filler breather valve has several functions. As the name suggests, the valve fulfils the 
filler-neck breather function. In addition, however, it also performs the service breather 
function It also has a rollover function. 

The filler breather valve is notable for its large opening, which allows air to escape rapidly 
from the tank during refueling. If, during refueling, the float of the filler breather valve 
ascends with the rising fuel level and thereby closes the breather hole, fuel will rise up 
the fuel filler pipe and switch off the fuel nozzle. 

During vehicle operation, the pressure in the fuel system can rise as a result of the 
increase in temperature. This pressure is allowed to escape through the filler and service 
breather valve and the fuel trap. Fuel that is carried along in the process is collected in 
the fuel trap and sucked back while the fuel pump is in operation.

■ Pressure Limiting Valve 

The pressure limiting valve is connected to ground by the plug-in contacts on the ser¬ 
vice cover. This prevents electrostatic charge on the valve. 

The pressure limiting valve keeps fuel pressures in the feed section lower than approxi¬ 
mately 5.8 bar in the N63 engines 

This prevents excess pressures from building up in the feed line. Excess pressures 
would otherwise occur if the fuel filter were to become blocked, which would place 
the feed section of the fuel system under unnecessarily heavy loads.

Fuel Tank Breather System 

The increased demands on the evaporative emission systems require continuous devel¬ 
opment and improvements. The F01/F02 is no different. One of the first things to 
notice on the fuel tank is that there is only one service port. Also, the tank is made 
from two pieces and joined by a plastic “welding” process. 

The only items which are serviceable at this time are the fuel pump, fuel filter and pres¬ 
sure limiting valve. There are several breather valves installed to help the fuel tank 
“breathe” during 
refueling and during operation. 

These valves are therefore divided into filler valves and service breather valves. 

The service breather valves have a smaller opening, which means that, during refueling, 
they alone would not be able to let air escape from the fuel tank fast enough. 

There are service breather valves with and without over fueling protection. The service 
breather valves are arranged in such a way that air can still be released even if the vehi¬ 
cle is parked up on one side. 

The filler breather valve is located at a high position. If the fuel level rises to this height 
during refueling, the valve closes. Air can no longer escape from the fuel tank fast 
enough, which causes fuel to rise up the filler pipe and switch off the fuel nozzle. 

To enable the release of air to continue, there is a service breather valve located at the 
highest point. However, the presence of the valve in this location means that the fuel 
tank could be overfilled in the event of persistent refueling. 

Consequently, fuel would enter the activated charcoal filter and ultimately flow back out 
of the opening. To prevent this, the highest service breather valve is equipped with over 
fueling protection like the one on the left-hand side of the vehicle (as a safeguard if the 
vehicle were parked up on one side). Fuel that is carried along with the release of air is 
collected in a fuel trap and pumped back into the surge chamber.

Direct Injection 


The term “Direct Injection” refers to a fuel injection system which injects fuel directly 
into the combustion chamber rather than into the intake manifold. This technology has 
been around since the 1930’s, but has not been in widespread use until the late 20th 
century. 


The early development of this type of injection system took place in Germany in 1937 
on an aircraft engine. The first passenger car to run on direct engine was a car called 
the “Gutbrod” in the early 1950’s. 



Due to the complexity and cost of the direct injection system, the technology did not 
take hold. Later, the development of more cost efficient components and the need for 
a more efficient internal combustion engine, the Dl engine made a comeback in the late 
1990’s. 


The first application of this technology on a BMW was in 2003 on the 760Li (N73 
Engine). The N73 V-12 engine utilized direct injection with the combination of VAL- 
VETRONIG and the latest direct injection technology. 

For the 2007 model year, BMW introduced a new 6-cylinder engine with direct fuel 
injection. The N54, which is turbocharged, uses the second generation of direct injec¬ 
tion (Dl 2), which is referred to as High Precision Injection (HPI). 

Since then BMW introduced the N55, N63, S63 and N74, all of which incorporate 
Direct Injection Systems with either Piezo Injectors (HPI; N54, N63, S63, N74) or 
Solenoid type Injectors (HDEV; N55). 


25 

Fuel Management 





Direct Injection Principles 

As the name suggest, the direct injection (Dl) system use a fuel injector which sprays 
fuel directly into the combustion chamber. The fuel injection pressure (N73). The A/F 
mixture in a Dl engine is formed inside of the combustion chamber. 

In comparison, a manifold injection system sprays fuel into the intake manifold or into the 
intake port near the intake valve. In this case, the A/F mixture is formed outside of the 
combustion chamber. The injection pressure on most manifold injection systems is 
between 3 and 5 bar. 



The Dl system allows for increased engine efficiency and has several distinct advantages 
over manifold injection systems: 


• The fuel is evaporated and atomized in the combustion chamber, which provides a 
“cooling effect” on combustion. A cooler combustion chamber allows an increase 
in air density, which allows for more available oxygen. In addition, cooler combus¬ 
tion allows for an increase in compression ratio which equates to improved efficien¬ 
cy and engine power. 

• By injecting the fuel directly into the combustion chamber, there is less possibility 
for fuel to condense or accumulate on the manifold walls or the back of the intake 
valve. This results in less fuel needed to achieve the desired A/F ratio. 

• The increased injection pressure causes the fuel droplet size to be reduced. This 
allows for improved atomization and therefore improved mixture formation. 


26 

Fuel Management 




Mixture Formation 

In a conventional (manifold injection) engine, the air fuel mixture is formed outside of the 
combustion chamber. In contrast, the mixture must be formed inside the combustion 
chamber in a Dl engine. 

A Dl fuel system has two basic operating concepts: 

■ Homogeneous Mixture Formation 

A homogeneous mixture means that the A/F ratio is stoichiometrically controlled much in 
the same way as a manifold injection system. This means that the A/F mixture is evenly 
spread throughout the combustion chamber. One of the primary advantages of this 
arrangement is that a conventional three-way catalytic converter can be used. Also, the 
sulfur content of the fuel is not a factor which allows the engine to be used in all global 
markets. 

/|\ Currently, BMW only uses engines which operate in this mode. 
t I y The N52, N54, N55, N63 and N74, all operate mostly at Lambda = 1. 


H Stratified Mixture Formation 

In the stratified injection method, a homogeneous mixture is only created around the 
area of the spark plug. A lean (inhomogeneous) mixture exists in the rest on the com¬ 
bustion chamber. Therefore the overall A/F mixture in the combustion chamber is lean 
(Lambda > 1). This results in increased combustion chamber temperature, and subse¬ 
quently increased NOx emissions. The increased NOx requires the use of a DeNOx cat¬ 
alyst which is not effective when sulfur is present in the fuel. Therefore, sulfur free fuel 
must be used which is not readily available in all markets. 


For the time being, BMW does not have any engines which operate as “stratified 
charge” engines.

As the above chart shows, the use of load stratification (1) is only possible in a limited 
load and speed range. Over and above this load and speed range, the engines can only 
be operated in homogeneous mode (2-3). 

Through the deployment of VALVETRONIC, the N73 engine in the middle torque/speed 
range (1) demonstrates the same consumption advantages as engines of other manu¬ 
facturers with charge stratification. 

Because large-capacity engines are mainly operated in the lower to middle load and 
speed range, it is only advisable to use load stratification in these engines. 

Smaller-sized engines are mainly operated in the high load and speed range and thus in 
homogeneous mode. 



In the US market, BMW only uses engines that operate in 
“Homogeneous Mixture Formation”.

High Precision Injection (HPI) 

BMW High Precision Injection (HPI) is the latest development of BMW direct fuel injec¬ 
tion. This is the second generation of direct injection (Dl 2) for BMW. The first genera¬ 
tion was on the N73 engine in 2003. 

The term “High Precision” refers to the precise metering and directional control of the 
atomized fuel. Also, the injection process now allows for multiple injection events due to 
the use of piezo injectors. The HPI system represents a key function in the concept for 
the most economical use of fuel without compromising performance.

High Precision Injection allows for a more precise metering of the fuel injection process 
and therefore permits higher compression ratios e.g. 10.2 to 1 in the N54 and N55 (see 
table). One of the key reasons that makes this possible is the use of the so called “spray 
guided” injection which cools the air charge and decreases the possibility of unwanted 
engine knock. 

The operating pressure of the HPI system varies from 50-200 bar. 



The N52KP and N51 engines continue to use the 
conventional “manifold injection” system from 
the N52. 


29 

Fuel Management 















High-precision injection represents the key function in the concept for as economic a 
use of fuel as possible. The new generation of petrol direct injection satisfies the 
expectations placed on it with regard to economic efficiency without compromising on 
the engine's dynamic qualities. 

High-precision injection provides for a more precise metering of mixture and higher 
compression - ideal preconditions for increasing efficiency and significantly reducing 
consumption. 

This is made possible by locating the piezo injector (or solenoid type in the N55) central¬ 
ly between the valves. In this position, the new injector, which opens in an outward direc¬ 
tion (inward in the N55), distributes a particularly uniform amount of tapered shaped fuel 
into the combustion chamber. 

BMW HPI spark ignition engines operate according to the spray-directed process. 


N54 - High Precision Injection 

Using the N54 engine as an example, the fuel is delivered from the fuel tank by the elec¬ 
tric fuel pump via the feed line (5) at a “feed” pressure of 5 bar to the high pressure 
pump. The feed pressure is monitored by the low-pressure sensor (6). The fuel is deliv¬ 
ered by the electric fuel pump in line with demand. 

The high pressure pump is driven “in-tandem” with the vacuum pump which is driven by 
the oil pump chain drive assembly. 

The fuel is compressed in the permanently driven three-plunger high-pressure pump (8) 
and delivery through the high-pressure line (9) to the rail (3). The fuel accumulated 
under pressure in the rail in this way is distributed via the high-pressure lines (1) to the 
piezo injectors (2). 



If the low fuel pressure sensor fails, the electric fuel pump continues 
to run at 100% delivery with terminal KL_15 ON. 


30 

Fuel Management 



The required fuel delivery pressure is determined by the engine-management system as 
a function of engine load and engine speed among other variables. The reached pres¬ 
sure level is recorded by the high-pressure sensor (4) and communicated to the Engine 
Control Unit. 

Control is effected by the fuel-supply control valve (7) by way of a setpoint/actual-value 
adjustment of the rail pressure. Configuration of the pressure is geared towards best 
possible consumption and smooth running of the engine.

The high pressure fuel injection system (HDE) is used on the N55 engine. In contrast

hole nozzles. 

The following overview shows the complete fuel injection system. The system is similar 
to the N54 fuel injection. Although the same high pressure pump, pressure sensor, and 
fuel rail are used, the high pressure fuel injection valves are new. The HDE system uses

responding to engine requirements. The same fuel pressure sensor is used in the

The fuel is pressurized in the permanently driven three-piston high pressure pump and 
delivered to the fuel rail via the high pressure line. The fuel stored under pressure in the 
fuel rail is distributed via the high pressure lines to the high pressure fuel injection valves. 
The required fuel pressure is determined by the engine management as a function of the 
engine load and engine speed. The pressure level is registered by the rail pressure 
sensor and sent to the engine control unit. The fuel is regulated by the quantity control 
valve based on a target/actual value comparison of the rail pressure. The pressure level is 
configured such to achieve the smoothest running properties with the best possible fuel 
consumption. 


High Fuel Pressure diagram 



As you can see on the diagram, a pressure of 200 bar is only required 
at high load and low engine speed.

High Pressure Pump Function and Design 
■ N54/N55 

In the N54/N55 the fuel is delivered via the supply passage (6) at the admission pressure 
generated by the electric fuel pump to the high-pressure pump. From there, the fuel is 
directed via the fuel supply control valve (4) and the low-pressure non-return valve (2) 
into the fuel chamber (14) of the plunger-and-barrel assembly. The fuel is placed under 
pressure in this plunger-and-barrel assembly and delivered via the high pressure non¬ 
return valve (9) to the high pressure port (7).

The high-pressure pump is connected with the vacuum pump via the drive flange (11) 
and is thus also driven by the chain drive, i.e. as soon as the engine is running, the three 
plungers (12) are permanently set into up-and-down motion via the pendulum disc (10). 

Fuel therefore continues to be pressurized for as long as new fuel is supplied to the 
high-pressure pump via the fuel-supply control valve (4). The fuel-supply control valve is 
activated by means of the engine management connection (3) and thereby admits the 
quantity of fuel required. 

Pressure control is effected via the fuel-supply control valve by opening and closing of 
the fuel supply channel. The maximum pressure in the high-pressure area is lim¬ 
ited to 245 bar. If excessive pressure is encountered, the high-pressure circuit is 
relieved by a 

pressure-limiting valve via the ports (8 and 5) leading to the low-pressure area. 

This is possible without any problems because of the incompressibility of the fuel, i.e. the 
fuel does not change in volume in response to a change in pressure. The pressure peak 
created is compensated for by the liquid volume in the low-pressure area. 

Volume changes caused by temperature changes are compensated for by the thermal 
compensator (1), which is connected with the pump oil filling. 

■ N63/N74 

The fuel is delivered via the supply passage at the admission pressure generated by the 
electric fuel pump to the high pressure pump. 

From there, the fuel is directed via the volume control valve and the low pressure non¬ 
return valve into the fuel chamber of the plunger and-barrel assembly. 

The high pressure pump on the N74 is in principle, the same as the one used on the 
N63 engine. The only difference is that the fuel lines are positioned at a different angle. 


N63 



38 

Fuel Management 


The fuel is delivered to the high-pressure pump via the inlet with delivery pressure gen¬ 
erated by the electric fuel pump. The fuel is then fed via the volume control valve and 
into the compression chamber of the pump element. In this pump element, the fuel is 
placed pressurized by a plunger and supplied via the high-pressure non-return valve to 
the high-pressure connection. 

The high-pressure pump is bolted onto the cylinder head and is driven by the camshaft 
by a triple cam. This means that, as soon as the engine is running, the triple cam contin¬ 
uously moves the plunger. Fuel is pressurized until new fuel is delivered via the volume 
control valve into the high-pressure pump. The volume control valve is activated by the 
engine management system; it specifies the delivered volume of fuel. Pressure regula¬ 
tion takes place via the volume control valve in that it is opened or closed by the pump 
element towards the fuel feed. When the quantity control valve is opened, most of the 
fuel drawn in by the piston is pressed back into the fuel feed.

The maximum pressure in the high-pressure area is restricted to 245 bar. If the maxi¬ 
mum high pressure is reached, the high-pressure circuit is relaxed to the low-pressure 
area by a pressure limiting valve. In this case the pressure peak in the low pressure area 
is compensated for by the fluid volume in the area and pressure damper in the compen¬ 
sating chamber. The compensating chamber is integrated into the inlet towards the high 
pressure pump. 

This set-up ensures that pressure peaks are lowered by connecting and disconnecting 
the high and low-pressure areas. When the piston generates pressure, fuel flows 
between the piston and its guide. This is deliberate, as it lubricates the pair of sliding ele¬ 
ments. On downward movement of the pressure piston, a high pressure would arise at 
its rear side. This would lead to danger if the fuel is pressed through the sealing of the 
piston from the pump into the oil circuit of the engine. 

The connection to the compensating chamber means that there is never a higher pres¬ 
sure behind the piston than in the fuel feed. This prevents pressure fluctuations from 
being transferred into the low pressure fuel system, as the volume changes in front of 
and behind the piston are balanced. 

■ Pressure Generation in High-pressure Pump 

The plunger (2) driven by the pendulum disc presses 
oil (red) into the metal diaphragm (1) on its upward 
travel. The change in volume of the metal diaphragm 
thereby reduces the available space in the fuel 
chamber. The fuel thereby placed under pressure 
(blue) is forced into the rail. 

Depending on the activation signal, a restrictor cross- 
section of varying size is opened and the fuel-mass 
flow required for the respective load point is set. 

There is also the possibility of reducing the pressure 
in the rail.

Fuel Injectors/Fuel Rail 

The type of fuel injector depends on the engine design. BMW for the most part utilizes 
two different configurations: 

• Injectors mounted into the cylinder head spraying fuel into the intake port and; 

• Injectors mounted into the cylinder head spaying fuel directly into the combustion 
chamber, also known as Direct Injection. 

Furthermore, BMW uses two different types of injectors: 

• Solenoid Injector (in low and high pressure systems) 

• Piezo Injector (only used in high pressure systems) 

Piezo Fuel Injectors (HPI) 

It is the outward-opening piezo-injector that renders possible spray-directed direct 
injection and thus the overall innovations of BMW engines i.e. N54, N63 & N74. Due to 
the fact that only this component ensures that the injected fuel spray cone remains sta¬ 
ble, even under the prevailing influences of pressure and temperature in the combustion 
chamber. 

This piezo-injector permits injection pressures of up to 200 bar and extremely quick 
opening of the nozzle needle. In this way, it is possible to inject fuel into the combustion 
chamber under conditions released from the power cycles limited by the valve opening 
times. 

Piezo Fuel Injecto (HPI) 



The piezo-injector is integrated together with the spark plug centrally between the inlet 
and exhaust valves in the cylinder head. This installation position prevents the cylinder 
walls or the piston crown from being wetted with injected fuel. A uniform formation of 
the homogeneous air/fuel mixture is obtained with the aid of the gas movement in the 
combustion chamber and a stable fuel spray cone. 


44 

Fuel Management 



The gas movement is influenced on the one hand by the geometty of the intake 
passages and on the other by the shape of the piston crown. The injected fuel is swirled 
in the combustion chamber with the boost air until a homogeneous mixture is available 
throughout the compression space at the point of ignition. 



When working on HPI/HDE Fuel Systems it is important to ensure that 
the ignition coils are not fouled by fuel. The resistance of the silicone 
material is significantly reduced by heavy fuel contact. This can 
cause sparkover at the spark-plug head and with it misfires. 


• Before making modifications to the fuel system, remove the 
ignition coils without fail and protect the spark-plug slot 
against the ingress of fuel with a cloth. 


• Before refitting the piezo-injector, remove the ignition 
coils and ensure conditions of absolute cleanliness. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced. 


45 

Fuel Management 



■ Injector Design and Function 

The piezo-injector essentially consists of three sub-assemblies. The expansion of the 
energized piezo-element lifts the nozzle needle outwards from its valve seat. To be able 
to counter the different operating temperatures with comparable valve lifts, the injector 
has a thermal compensating element.

The nozzle needle is pressed outwards

flows through this annular orifice and forms 
a hollow cone, the spray angle of which is 
not dependent on the backpressure in the 
combustion chamber. 



Do not attempt to clean the 
injectors in any way. This 
may result in damage which 
can effect the spray pattern.

Fuel Management 









The spray cone (1) of a piezo-injector can diverge during operation (2). Due to the for¬ 
mation of soot inside the engine, such divergence is perfectly normal and acceptable to 
a certain extent. If, however, spray divergence reaches the stage where it begins to 
spray the spark plug wet, the spark plug may incur damage.

L Replace the Teflon sealing ring when fitting and removing the piezo¬ 
injector. This also applies when an injector that has Just been fitted 
has to be removed again after an engine start. 

A piezo-injector provided with a new Teflon sealing ring should be fit¬ 
ted as quickly as possible because the Teflon sealing ring could swell 
up. Please observe the repair instructions and follow without fail. 

When fitting, make sure that the piezo injector is correctly seated. 

The hold-down element for securing the piezo-injectors must rest on 
both injector tabs, otherwise the necessary force is not applied to the 
piezo-injector. Do not clean the nozzle-needle tip of the piezo-injec- 
tor.

■ Injection Strategy 

Injection of the fuel mass required for the operating situation can take place in up to 
three individual injections. Which option is used in the relevant operating situation is 
dependent on engine load and speed. Here, the actual time resulting from the engine 
speed available for metering the fuel is an important framework quantity. 

A special situation during the operation of any engine is the range in which a high load 
occurs at low engine speed, so-called "Low End Torque" operation. In this operating 
situation, the required fuel mass is metered to the engine in three individual injections. 

This results in a highly effective mixture formation which in the final analysis has the 
effect of both increasing power output and saving fuel.

■ Catalytic Converter Heating Mode 

In order to bring the catalytic converters up to operating temperature as quickly as 
possible, BMW engines enter a catalyst-heating mode when the engine performs a cold 
start. In this mode, combustion heat is intentionally introduced into the exhaust train and 
not used first and foremost to develop power output. 

The point of ignition is moved to 30° (crankshaft degrees) after TDC. The main quantity 
of the required fuel is injected before TDC and mixed with boost air. The piston is 
situated after TDC in its downward travel such that the air/fuel mixture is already expand¬ 
ing again, which reduces the ignitability of the mixture. 

In order to ignite the mixture reliably, a small residual quantity of fuel is injected 25° after 
TDC and this guarantees an ignitable mixture at the spark plug. This small fuel quantity 
therefore provides for ignition of the residual charge in the combustion chamber. 

This operating mode is set by the engine-management system after a 
/f \ maximum period of 60 seconds from engine starting but is terminated 
^ if the catalytic-converter response temperature is reached earlier.

■ Piezo Element 

The movement of the nozzle needle in the injector is generated no longer by a solenoid 
coil but rather by a piezo-element. 

A piezo-element is an electromechanical converter, i.e. it consists of a ceramic material 
which converts electrical energy directly into mechanical energy (force/travel). A familiar 
application is the piezo cigarette lighter - when a piezo-crystal is pressed, voltage is 
generated until a spark flashes over and the gas ignites. 

In the case of the piezo-actuator, voltage is generated so that the crystal expands. In 
order to achieve greater travel, it is possible to design a piezo-element in several layers. 

The actuator module consists of layers of the piezo-ceramic material connected 
mechanically in series and electrically in parallel. The deflection of a piezo-crystal is 
dependent on the applied voltage up to a maximum deflection; the higher the voltage, 
the greater the travel.

■ Injector Adjustment 

When the injectors are manufactured, a multitude of measurement data is recorded at 
specific points in the factory. In this way, the tolerance ranges for injector-quantity 
adjustment are determined and specified in a six-digit number combination. 

Information on the lift performance of the injector is also added for injector voltage 
adjustment. Injector adjustment is required because of the individual voltage demand of 
each piezo actuator. An allocation is made to a voltage demand category, which is 
included in the number combination on the injector. 

These data items are transmitted to the ECM. During engine operation, these values are 
used to compensate for deviations in the metering and switching performance. 



When replacing an injector, it is absolutely essentially to carry out an 
injector adjustment. 


50 

Fuel Management 
















■ Injector Control and Adaptation 

The fuel mass required for the operating situation is injected by the piezo-injector into 
the combustion chamber. This mass can be influenced by three correcting variables: 

• Rail pressure 

• Injector opening time 

• Injector opening lift 

The injector opening time and the injector opening lift are activated directly at the piezo 
injector. The opening time is controlled via the “ti” signal and the opening lift via the 
energy quantity in the activation of the piezo-injector. 

■ Injector Adaptation 

The fuel masses and injection cycles determined from the load/speed map are included 
in a pilot-control program map. Here, while further framework parameters are taken into 
consideration, the energy quantities and injector opening times required to activate the 
injectors are determined. BMW engines can be safely and reliably operated with these 
program-map values. 


51 

Fuel Management 




■ Optimization 

For optimization of: 

• Emission values; 

• Smooth running; 

• Fuel consumption; 

• Power output; 

the controlled variables of energy quantities and injector opening times are continuously 
monitored. This occurs on a bank-selective basis by way of lambda closed-loop control. 

The residual oxygen in the exhaust gas is measured in each case for cylinder bank 1 and 
cylinder bank 2. This measurement result is compared with the values expected from 
the set correcting variables. The result of a deviation is that the injector opening signal is 
adapted. This adaptation is stored in the control unit and is therefore available for 
subsequent engine operation. 

However, these stored values are lost when the system is flashed and must be 
relearned. A further adaptation of the injector activation takes place depending on time 
and use. This cylinder-selective adaptation involves a check of the residual-oxygen con¬ 
tent with a conclusion as to the cylinder causing the situation. To this end, it is neces¬ 
sary for part of the exhaust-gas flow not to be swirled in the turbocharger. For this rea¬ 
son, the flap of the wastegate valve must be fully opened, i.e. swung out of the exhaust- 
gas flow. This wastegate-flap position extends beyond its normal opening position in 
engine operation. Based on the result of this cylinder-selective monitoring, the energy 
quantity is adapted if necessary to activate the injectors. 

Furthermore, the cylinder-selective adaptation includes, if necessary, an adaptation of 
the injector opening signal based on smooth running monitoring of BMW engines. 



Overall adaptation of the injectors is 
limited to a 15% additional quantity.

Solenoid Type Fuel Injectors N55 (HDE) 

The high pressure fuel injection valve Bosch HDEV5.2 is a solenoid type injector. In con¬ 
trast to the piezo-electric injectors used on the current BMW engines, the solenoid valve 
fuel injectors are designed as inward-opening multi-hole valves with highly variable jet 
angle and form. They operate at a system pressure of up to 200 bar. 


CAUTION!!! 


Do not open the fuel system if the coolant temperature 
is above 40°C/104°F. The residual pressure in the high 
pressure fuel system could cause bodily injury. 


It is essential to observe the utmost cleanliness when working on the high pressure fuel 
system and to follow the proper working procedures described in the repair instructions. 
Even minute soiling or damage at the thread connections of the high pressure lines 
could cause leaks. 



Special tool #13 0 270 must be used to remove the HDEV5.2 high 
pressure injector valves from the engine. Damage to the injector or 
the related components may occur otherwise. See the Service 
Information section in this training material for more information. 


Particular care must be taken when working on the fuel system of the 
N55 engine to ensure that the ignition coils are not wet with fuel. The 
resistance of the silicone insulating material of the coils is greatly 
reduced by the contact with fuel. This could result in arcking at the 
top of the spark plug and misfiring. See the Service Information sec¬ 
tion and repair instructions for more information.

The following graphic shows the arrangement of the individual components in the com¬ 
bustion chamber of the N55. It can be seen that the BMW (spray-guided) high precision 
injection (HPI) system is not used but rather a Bosch solenoid valve fuel injector with 
multi-hole nozzle. The fuel injection is specially adapted to the combination of 
Valvetronic III and turbocharging. For better illustration, a set of valves has been 
removed in the graphic.

HPI/HDE System Service 

Fuel System Safety 

• Working on the fuel system is only permitted after the engine has cooled down. 

The coolant temperature must not exceed 40°C/104°F. This must be observed 
without fail, otherwise there is a danger of fuel sprayback on account of the residual 
pressure in the high pressure fuel system. 

• When working on the high pressure fuel system, take particular care to ensure con¬ 
ditions of absolute cleanliness and follow the work sequences described in the 
repair instructions. Even the tiniest contaminants and damage to the screw con¬ 
nections on the high pressure lines can cause leaks. 

• When working on the fuel system of BMW engines, it is important to ensure that 
the ignition coils are not fouled by fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is 
significantly reduced by heavy fuel contact. This can cause sparkover at the spark¬ 
plug head and cause misfires. 

• Before making modifications to the fuel system, remove the ignition coils without 
fail and protect the spark-plug slot against the ingress of fuel with a cloth. 

• Before refitting piezo-injectors, remove the ignition coils and ensure conditions of 
absolute cleanliness. 

• Ignition coils heavily fouled by fuel must be replaced.

Fuel Injectors - N55 

In order to remove the N55 fuel injectors from the cylinder head, special tool #13 0 270 
must be utilized. Failure to use the special tool will result in damage to the injectors. 



There is a new tool #13 0 280 that must be used when replacing the PTFE seals on 
the tips of the solenoid valve injectors. As with piezoelectric injectors these seals must 
be replaced if and when the injectors are being re-installed. 




Do not open the high pressure fuel injection system if the coolant 
temperature is above 40°C . The residual pressure in the high pres¬ 
sure fuel system could cause bodily injury. 


It is essential to follow the repair instructions and observe the utmost 
cleanliness when working on the high pressure fuel system. Even 
minute soiling or damage at the connections of the high pressure 
lines and cause leaks.

High Pressure Fuel Injector Valve (HDE) 

The HDEV5.2 solenoid type injector valves used on the N55 engine are a new 
development. 

1 Booster phase: 

Opening of the HDEV5.2 is initiated in the booster phase by a high booster volta 
from the DME. The booster phase ends on reaching approximately 10 amps. 

The high current is achieved by a voltage of up to approximately 65 Volt. 

2 Energizing phase: 

In the energizing phase, the HDEV5.2 is completely opened by controlling the 
current to approximately 6.2 amps. At the end of the energizing phase, the current 
is reduced to the holding current level of approximately 2.5 amps. 

3 Hold phase: 

The energized HDEV5.2 is kept open by controlling the current at approximately 
2.5 amps in the hold phase. 

4 Switch off phase: 

The current is switched off at the end of the injection time (in the switch off phase). 
At least 2 milliseconds elapse between two injection cycles.

Workshop Hints 

Before any service work is performed on any fuel system related component, always 
adhere to the following: 

• Observe relevant safety legislation pertaining to your area. 

• Ensure adequate ventilation. 

• Use exhaust extraction system where applicable (alleviate fumes). 

• DO NOT OPERATE THE FUEL PUMP unless it is properly installed in the 
fuel tank and is submersed in the fuel (fuel lubricates the pump). 

• Always wear adequate protection clothing including eye protection. 

• Use caution when working around a hot engine compartment 

• During fuel system repair that involves “sealing rings”, always replace them 
with new COPPER rings only. 

• BMW does not recommend any UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATIONS to the fuel 
system. The fuel system is designed to comply with strict federal safety and emis¬ 
sions regulations. In the concern of product liability, it is unauthorized to sell or 
perform modifications to customer vehicles, particularly in safety related areas. 

• Always consult the Repair Instructions on the specific model you are working on 
before attempting a repair. 


Fuel 

Fuel quality should always be considered when diagnosing a driveability complaint. 
The type of fuel, proper AKI/PON rating, impurities and moisture are not factored by 
the ECM. 

Please refer to the Owner’s Manual and following 
Service Information Bulletins regarding fuel: 

• SI B 13 07 06 Gasoline Quality & Detergent Additives 

• SI B 13 02 10 Fuel Systems 

• SI B 13 02 06 Top TIER Detergent Gasoline in BMW Vehicles 

• SBS 1996-13 06 96 (139) Group 13 (on ISTA>Workshop/Operating fluids)

Draining the Fuel Tank 

In order to remove the fuel tank it must be drained first to avoid fuel spills and handling 
excessive weight. In some cases depending on the fuel tank dimensions (vehicle specif¬ 
ic), it is also necessary to drain the fuel tank to replace the sending units and/or fuel 
pump. 


CAUTION!!! 


In some vehicles, the sending units/fuel pump is mount¬ 
ed lower than the top of the fuel tank. A fuel spill will be 
encountered if the fuel is not drained. 



Consult the BMW Service Workshop Equipment for the proper evacu¬ 
ation equipment. The saddle type tank requires an additional step to 
drain the fuel from the driver side. The evacuation equipment should 
be attached to the tank compensating hose (arrow) to drain out the 
remaining fuel. 


Fuel Pump/Pressure Regulator - Testing 

The fuel pump should be tested for delivery pressure 
and volume. Caution when disconnecting fuel hoses 
because there is the possibility of residual fuel pres¬ 
sure! Install the fuel pressure adapter and IMIB pres¬ 
sure sensing lead to the fuel pressure fitting *IMIB 
starts with atmospheric pressure as the base. 

If the 3.5 (*-i- atmosphere IMIB base starting point) bar 
fuel pressure is not achieved or bleed off is more than 
0.5 bar, refer to 

• REP 13 31 032 Check fuel pressure 

• REP 13 31 029 Checking fuel pump delivery 
pressure (N52) 

• REP 13 31 029 Checking fuel pump delivery 
pressure (M54) 

for further diagnosis. The Fuel Hose Clamp Tool can 
be used to isolate bleed off from the pump (non¬ 
return check valve) or the pressure regulator (restric¬ 
tion valve). Also verify power supply to the fuel pump. 





61 

Fuel Management 



















Fuel volume must be tested to verify: 

• Fuel Pump Output 

• Restrictions are not present in the pump 
pickup lines/hoses and fuel filter. 


Fuel Injectors 

When inspecting the fuel injectors, consider 
the following: 

• 0-rings should be replaced, lubrication 
with Vaseline or SAE 90 gear oil for instal¬ 
lation. 

• Verify the code number (different engine 
applications) 

• Plastic spacer washer is not damaged 

• Color code of housing (different engine 
applications) 

Fuel injectors can leak which bleeds off fuel 
pressure and increases emissions. The injec¬ 
tors can be tested using the Fuel Injector 
Leakage Tester. 

The fuel injectors can be cleaned, refer to: 

• SI B 04 07 07 Fuel Injection and 
Induction System Cleaning 


62

The Fuel Injectors should also be tested using the 
ISTA for:

ECM Final Stage transistor activation. This test 
functions is found under the oscilloscope Preset 
list - “Ti Injection Signal”. Install the Universal

ground activation circuit for the injector. This test 
is performed with the engine cranking or running.

When testing fuel pressure, the hand 
held fuel pressure gage (SWZ 13 3 060) 
can be used. 

Caution: Residual fuel pressure may be 
present! 

The IMIB is equipped with a pressure 
measuring function, found in 
Measurement testing. The following 
adapters (Special Tool numbers) will be 
necessary: 

• SWZ 13 6 051 

• SWZ 13 6 055 

• SWZ 13 6 057 
These adapters install “inline” in the fuel pressure hose. 

For vehicles equipped with “quick-release” couplings, install special tool (SWZ 13 5 270) 
between the fuel filter (1) and pressure supply hose (2). This tool will couple to the IMIB 
Pressure Adapter (3). 

Later production fuel rails are equipped with a threaded adapter fitting (1). 

This threaded adapter fitting allows Adapter (SWZ 13 5 220) to be threaded on to the 
fuel rail and coupled to the IMIB Pressure Adapter. 

When testing the fuel injectors for leakage, use Special Tool #88 88 5 000 362. Leak 
testing the fuel injectors is one of the diagnostic steps listed in: 

• SI B 13 08 90 (3096) Long Cranking Times. 

This tool pressurizes the injectors with air and the injector tips are submersed in water. If 
air bubbles are present, this indicates the leaking injector(s).
