Introduction 


Cooling System N54 

The cooling system of the N54 engine consists of a radiator circuit and an isolated 
oil cooling circuit. The fact that there is an isolated oil-cooling circuit ensures that heat 
is not introduced via the engine oil into the engine's coolant system. 

There is a significantly greater guantity of heat on account of this engine's increased 
power of 75.5 kW/l in comparison with the N52. 

This boundary condition is satisfied by the engine cooling system with its increased 
performance. This increase in power was to be realized in spite of some factors less 
advantageous to cooling. 

Factors to be mentioned here are: 

• Approximately 15% less flow area is available on account of the intercooler located 
below the radiator. 

• The already small amount of space provided by the engine compartment is further 
limited by the accommodation of further components. 

• Because the exhaust turbochargers are cooled by the coolant, an additional guanti¬ 
ty of heat is introduced into the system via these turbochargers. 

Measures for increasing cooling-system performance: 

• Coolant pump with increased power 400 W/9000 l/h 

• Separation of water and engine-oil cooling 

• Radiator with increased power 

• Electric fan with increased power 600W for all gearbox variants 
Charge-air cooling is described in the section dealing with air-intake ducting.

Layout 

The structure of the coolant circuit on the N54 is the same as that of the N52 engine. 
The engine is flushed through with coolant in accordance with the cross-flow concept. 
Cooling output can be influenced as a function of load by activating the following com¬ 
ponents: 

• Electric fan 

• Electric coolant pump 

• Map thermostat 

It is also possible in an N54 engine in conjunction with an automatic gearbox to utilize 
the lower area of the radiator to cool the gearbox by means of the gearbox-oil cooler. 
This is achieved as in the N52 engine with control sleeves, which are introduced into 
the radiator tank. 

Radiator 

Design measures have been used to increase the performance of the radiator itself. 
The performance of a radiator is dependent on its radiation surface. However, the 
intercooler still had to be installed underneath the radiator, and this meant that is was 
necessary to compensate for the smaller flow area available. 

Compared with the N52 engine, the radiator used in the N54 engine has a block depth 
which has been increased to 32 mm. In addition, the water pipes are situated closer 
together than in previously used radiators. The upshot of this is an increase in the 
utilizable radiation surface.

Electric Coolant Pump (EWP) 

The coolant pump of the N54 engine is an electrically driven centrifugal pump with a 
power output of 400W and a maximum flow rate of 9000 l/h. This represents a signifi¬ 
cant increase in power of the electric coolant pump used in the N52 engine, which has 
a power output of 200 W and a maximum flow rate of 7000 l/h.

Motor 




The power of the electric wet-rotor motor is electronically controlled by the electronic 
module (3) in the pump. The electronic module is connected via the bit-serial data 
interface (BSD) to the ECM engine control unit. 

The engine control unit uses the engine load, the operating mode and the data from the 
temperature sensors to calculate the reguired cooling output. Based on this data, the 
engine control unit issues the corresponding command to the electric coolant pump. 

The electric coolant pump regulates its speed in accordance with this command. 

The system coolant flows through the motor of the coolant pump, thus cooling both 
the motor as well as the electronic module. The coolant lubricates the bearings of the 
electric coolant pump. 



The same rules apply to all Electric Coolant Pumps (EWP). The pump 
must be filled with coolant when removed for service to prevent any 
corrosion. Also, the pump impeller must be turned by hand before 
installation to ensure the pump is not seized. 


8 

Cooling Systems 








































































Particular care must be taken when performing servicing work to ensure that 
the pump does not run dry. When the pump is removed, it should be stored 
filled with coolant. The bearing points of the pump could stick fast if the pump 
were not filled with coolant. This could jeopardize subseguent start-up of the 
pump thus rendering the entire heat management system inoperative (the 
pump not starting up could cause serious engine damage). If the pump 
should ever run dry, the pump wheel should be turned by hand before finally 
connecting the coolant hoses. The system should then be immediately filled 
with coolant. 


Particular care must be taken during assembly to ensure that the 
connector is clean and dry and the connections are undamaged. 

Diagnosis should be performed only with the approved adapter cables. 
The information provided in the repair instructions must be observed. 


Due to this coolant pump, a special filling and bleeding procedure 
must be implemented for servicing: 

1. Fill system with coolant via the expansion tank (AGB). 

Top up coolant level to lower edge of expansion tank. 

2. Close expansion tank. 

3. Switch on ignition. 

4. Set heating to maximum (temperature), switch on blower 
(lowest stage). 

5. Press accelerator pedal module right down for at least 
10 seconds. The engine must NOT be started. 

6. Bleeding via EWP takes approx. 12 minutes. Then check coolant 
level in expansion tank, top up to MAX marking if necessary. 

7. Check cooling circuit and drain plugs for leaks. 

8. If the procedure needs to be repeated several times, allow DME 
to completely de-energize (remove ignition key for approx. 

3 minutes) and then repeat procedure as from Point 3. 

Connect battery charger if battery charge level is low.

Cooling System N55 

The cooling system of the N55 is enhanced with additional oil cooling. 

Two different types of oil cooling systems are used depending on the model and appli¬ 
cation. In the “hot climate” version, heat transfer from the engine oil to the engine 
coolant is avoided by separating the oil cooler from the engine coolant circuit. The other 
version uses an auxiliary radiator in combination with an oil to coolant heat exchanger 
bolted to the oil filter housing. The auxiliary radiator enhances cooling efficiency by 
adding surface area to the cooling system.

Cooling System N63 

Due to the exhaust turbocharging system and the compact arrangement of the tur¬ 
bochargers in the V-space, the heat output of the N63 engine is very high. 
Correspondingly, great significance is attached to the cooling system. In addition, an 
indirect charge air cooling system has been developed for the first time where the 
charge air is cooled by an air-to-coolant heat exchanger. There are two separate cooling 
circuits for engine and charge air cooling.

Cooling Systems 





The engine cooling system undertakes the classic task of carrying heat away from the 
engine and maintaining a defined operating temperature as constant as possible. As on 
the N54 engine, the two turbochargers are also cooled. 

Coolant Pumps N63 
Main coolant pump 

The N63 engine features a conventional coolant pump that is driven by the belt drive. 
This pump cannot be used to continue cooling the turbochargers after the engine has 
been shut down. For this reason the N63 is also eguipped with an auxiliary coolant 
pump. 

Auxiliary coolant pump for turbocharger cooling 

The electric coolant pump on the N54 engine features an after-running function to carry 
away the heat build-up from the turbochargers after the engine has been shut down. 

For this function, the N63 engine is eguipped with an additional electrically operated 
coolant pump with an output of 20 W. This pump is also used during engine operation to 
assist turbocharger cooling. 

The auxiliary electric coolant pump cuts in, taking the following factors into consideration: 

• Coolant temperature at engine outlet 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected fuel guantity 

The heat input into the engine is calculated based on the injected fuel guantity. This 
function is similar to the heat management function on 6-cylinder engines. 

The after-running period of the auxiliary electric coolant pump can extend up to 30 min¬ 
utes. The electric fan also cuts in to improve the cooling effect. 

n As in previous systems, the electric fan runs for a maximum 
( ! of 11 minutes, however, it now operates more frequently. 

System Protection 

As on the N54 engine, the N63 in the event of the coolant or engine oil being subject to 
excessive temperatures, certain functions in the vehicle are influenced in such a way that 
more energy is made available to the engine cooling system, i.e. temperature increasing 
loads are avoided. 


18 

Cooling Systems 



Cooling System N74 

Because of the turbocharging and indirect charge air cooling, the N74 engine has the 
same cooling reguirements as the N63 engine. Conseguently it too has two separate 
cooling circuits. One is for cooling the engine and exhaust turbochargers, the other is for 
charge air cooling and for cooling the two engine control units. 

The engine cooling system performs the task of drawing heat off the engine and 
maintaining the operating temperature as constant as possible. As on the N54 and N63 
engines, the two exhaust turbochargers are also cooled. 

On the N74 engine, the coolant passages have been integrated mainly in the engine 
block. Optimizations to the engine cooling circuit have enabled a significant reduction in 
the coolant guantity for the bypass mode, thus shortening the warm-up phase. 

The coolant feed line downstream of the coolant pump is routed directly beside the 
engines main oil duct. The oil in the main oil duct flows in the opposite direction to the 
coolant. This enhances the heat exchange between the two media, and has a positive 
effect on the engine oil temperature. The overall cooling effect is comparable with that 
of an engine oil-coolant heat exchanger. 

The coolant passages in the cylinder heads are similar to the N63 engine. The coolant 
flows through the cylinder heads diagonally from the outside to the inside, whereby it 
flows in at the rear (outside) and flows out at the front (inside). This is also known as 
diagonal cooling. 

As on the N63 engine, an additional electric coolant pump is used 
f which supplies the bearings of the exhaust turbochargers with 
* coolant.

Coolant Pumps N74 
Main coolant pump 

The main coolant pump is a conventional coolant pump driven mechanically by the belt 
drive. 

Auxiliary water pump for exhaust turbochargers 

Like the N63 engine, the N74 engine has an electric auxiliary water pump which allows 
heat to be dissipated from the exhaust turbochargers even after the engine has been 
switched off. This coolant pump has an electrical power output of 20 W. It is also used 
during engine operation to support exhaust turbocharger cooling. The electric auxiliary 
coolant pump is activated based on the following factors: 

• Coolant temperature at the engine outlet 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected volume of fuel

The injected volume of fuel is used to calculate the heat contribution to the engine. 
Operation is similar to that of the heat management system on the 6-cylinder engines. 
The after-running period of the electrical auxiliary coolant pump can last up to 30 
minutes. 

To improve the cooling effect, the electric fan is also switched on. 

| As in previous systems, the electric fan runs for a maximum of 
*— 11 minutes, however, it now operates more frequently. 

Expansion Tank 

For space reasons, the expansion tank is located in the front fender behind the wheel 
arch. A separate filling canister bolted to the front of the engine enables filling. The 
expansion tank and filling canister are interconnected by an expansion and tank ventila¬ 
tion line.

Charge Air Cooling 


Charge Air Cooling N63 

With the introduction of the N63 engine, indirect charge air cooling is used for the first 
time at BMW. Heat is taken from the charge air by means of an air-to-coolant heat 
exchanger. This heat is then given off via a coolant-to-air heat exchanger into the ambi¬ 
ent air. For this purpose, the charge air cooling system has its own low temperature 
cooling circuit, which is independent of the engine cooling circuit.

Cooling Systems 
































Intercoolers 

The intercoolers are installed on the end faces of the cylinder heads. They operate in 
accordance with the counterflow principle and cool the charge air by up to 80°C. 

Electric Coolant Pump 

The coolant circuit for charge air coolant is operated with a 50 W pump. This pump 
does not run automatically when the engine is turned on. 

Pump actuation depends on the following values: 

• Outside temperature 

• Difference between charge air temperature and outside temperature 

Venting 

A separate venting routine is provided for the purpose of venting the low-temperature 
circuit of the charge air cooling system. This venting is initiated in the same way as for 
the cooling circuit on 6-cylinder engines. 

The venting test module can be found in the “Service Functions” section of the diagnos¬ 
tic program. 

Charge Air Cooling N74 

The N63 engine was the first BMW engine to use indirect charge air cooling; this has 
now also been adopted for the N74 engine. The heat is extracted from the charge air by 
means of an air to coolant heat exchanger. This heat is then released to the ambient air 
across a coolant to air heat exchanger. To achieve this, the charge air cooling has its own 
low-temperature cooling circuit. This is independent of the engine cooling circuit. 

Auxiliary Coolant Pump for Charge Air Cooling 

The cooling circuit for charge air cooling is operated with a 50 W pump. It does not run 
automatically when the engine is switched on. 

The following parameters are used for the auxiliary pump activation: 

• Outside temperature 

• Difference between charge-air temperature and outside temperature. 

Charge-air Cooler 

The charge air coolers (intercoolers) are attached to the intake system near the rear of 
the cylinder heads. They enable efficient cooling of the charge air by extracting heat 
energy from the air charge and carrying it away to the coolant to air heat exchanger 
located in the front of the vehicle.

Engine Oil Cooling 


One of the main purposes of the ECM is to monitor and control the Engine-Oil Cooling 
which includes the actuation of several components. In the following pages you will find a 
generic explanation on how this system works. For more detailed information please 
access BMW Training Reference Manuals found on-line. 


Engine Oil Cooling (N54) 



The N54 engine is equipped with a high performance engine-oil cooler. The pendulum- 
slide pump delivers the oil from the oil sump to the oil filter. A thermostat flanged to the 
oil-filter housing admits the oil to the engine-oil cooler. The engine-oil cooler is located 
in the right wheel arch. The thermostat can reduce the resistance opposing the oil by 
opening the bypass line between the feed and return lines of the engine-oil cooler. This 
ensures that the engine warms up safely and quickly. 


27 

Cooling Systems 














Oil Pump and Pressure Control (N55) 

The oil pump has been redesigned with regard to the functionality and durability of the 
Duroplast reciprocating slide valve. The oil pump used in the N55 engine is a further 
development of the shuttle slide valve volume control oil pump. The activation of the oil 
pump is adapted by the engine management and controlled through an oil pressure 
control valve. 

The delivered oil volume is controlled by means of the oil pressure, based on specific 
reguirements. The modifications, compared to previous pumps, are primarily in the pump 
activation system. The oil pressure no longer acts directly on the control piston but 
rather directly on the slide valve. The engine management activates the electrohydraulic 
pressure control valve, which affects the oil pressure at the slide valve control mecha¬ 
nism within the oil pump, altering the pump output. This has the advantage of avoiding 
power losses by running the oil pump only when needed. 

The electrohydraulic pressure control valve controls the pump output and is bolted to 
the front of the engine block. It is operated based on a characteristic map within the 
DME (ECM) which in turn is based on feedback from the oil pressure sensor. The N55 
uses a special oil pressure sensor for this purpose which functions in the similar way as 
the HPI fuel pressure sensor.

Cooling Systems 





























The oil pressure generated by the oil pump (2) is delivered to the engine’s lubricating 
points and hydraulic actuators. This system uses oil pressure feed back to control the 
desired operating oil pressure. For this purpose, the oil pressure downstream of the oil 
filter (7) and engine oil-to-coolant heat exchanger (9) is adjusted by the DME (map-con¬ 
trolled) via the pressure control valve (4) to the pressure control valve (3). 

The actual generated oil pressure is registered by the oil pressure sensor (10) and 
recognized by the engine management. 

In the event of an electrical malfunction, the oil pressure is set to the default control 
setting. The pump compression springs are allowed to expand, moving the slide valve 
to its maximum oil pressure position.

Oil Pressure 

Since the N55 engine has an oil pump with electronic volumetric flow control, it is nec¬ 
essary to measure the oil pressure precisely. For this reason, a new oil pressure sensor 
is installed. 

Advantages of the new oil pressure sensor: 

• It now measures absolute pressure (previous measured relative pressure). 

• It is characteristic map control in all speed ranges. 

Oil Pressure Sensor 

The new oil pressure sensor can now determine the 
absolute pressure. 

The sensor delivers a more accurate pressure reading which 
is reguired for the electronic volume control oil pump func¬ 
tion. 

The sensor design is identical to that of the (high) fuel pres¬ 
sure sensor. The DME supplies a voltage of 5 Volt to the oil N55, oil P ressure sensor 
pressure sensor. 

Electronic Oil Condition Monitoring 

The oil guality sensor is used for measuring the oil level as on previous BMW engines. 

No oil dipstick is used in most BMW NG Engines. 

There is no dipstick including the guide tube on most BMW NG engines. This repre¬ 
sents a convenience function for the customer while enabling more accurate recording 
of the engine oil level. 

The engine oil level is measured by an oil condition/guality sensor and indicated in the 
central information display (CID) or KOMBI. The engine oil temperature and the oil condi¬ 
tion are also registered or calculated by the oil condition sensor. The signal from the oil 
condition sensor is evaluated in the ECM. The evaluated signal is then routed via the 
proper Bus to the instrument cluster and to the CID. 

Registering the engine oil level in this way ensures the engine oil level in the engine does 
not reach critically low levels thus protecting the engine from the associated damage. By 
registering the oil condition, it is also possible to determine when the next engine oil 
change is due. Overfilling the engine with oil can cause leaks - a corresponding warning 
is therefore given.

Function of the Oil Condition Sensor 

The sensor consists of two cylindrical capacitors arranged one above the other. The oil 
condition is determined by the lower, smaller capacitor (6). Two metal tubes (2 + 3), 
arranged one in the other, serve as the capacitor electrodes. The dielectric is the engine 
oil (4) between the electrodes. The electrical property of the engine oil changes as the 
wear or aggiing increases and the fuel additives break down. 

The capacitance of the capacitor (oil condition sensor) changes in line with the change in 
the electrical material properties of the engine oil (dielectric). This means that this capaci¬ 
tance value is processed in the evaluation electronics (7) integrated in the sensor to form 
a digital signal. 

The digital sensor signal is transferred to the ECM as an indication of the status of the 
engine oil. This actual value is used in the ECM to calculate the next oil change service 
due. 

The engine oil level is determined in the upper part of the sensor (5). This part of the 
sensor is located at the same level as the oil in the oil pan. As the oil level drops (dielec¬ 
tric), the capacitance of the capacitor changes accordingly. The electronic circuitry in the 
sensor processes this capacitance value to form a digital signal and transfers the signal 
to the ECM. 

A platinum temperature sensor (9) is installed at the base of the oil condition sensor for 
the purpose of measuring the engine oil temperature. 


The engine oil level, engine oil temperature and engine oil condition are registered 
continuously as long as voltage is applied at terminal KL_15. The oil condition sensor is 
powered via terminal KL_87. 



Faults/Evaluation 

The electronic circuitry in the oil condition sensor features a self-diagnosis function. A 
corresponding error message is sent to the ECM in the event of a fault in the oil condi¬ 
tion sensor.

Electronic Oil Level Indicator 


The oil level is measured in two stages: 

• Static oil level measurement while the vehicle is stationary 

• Dynamic oil level measurement during vehicle operation 


Static Oil Level Measurement at Engine OFF 



This is only a reference measurement as the oil condition sensor 
(OZS) is flooded when the engine is turned off and can only detect 
the minimum oil level. The oil level is measured correctly only when 
the engine is running (see Dynamic oil level measurement). 


After switching on the ignition, the static oil level measurement provides the driver with 
the opportunity of checking whether there is sufficient engine oil for safely and reliably 
starting the engine. 

1. It is important that the vehicle is parked horizontally otherwise the oil level 
measurement may be incorrect. 

2. Select on-board computer function "Service" -> "Oil level". 

If there is sufficient engine oil for safe and reliable engine start, a graphic appears in the 
CID in the form of an engine with a green oil sump.

If the oil level is close to minimum, the 
graphic appears with a yellow oil sump 
and an oil dipstick that represents the low 
oil level in yellow. 

A top-up request +1 liter additionally 
appears as a text message. The display 
will not change if less than 1 liter of oil is 
topped up. MAX is indicated only after top¬ 
ping up a quantity of 1 liter. 

If the oil level drops below minimum, the 
graphic appears with a red oil sump and 
an oil dipstick that represents the low oil 
level in red. 

A top-up request +1 liter will additionally 
appear as a text message. 

The display will not change if less than 1 
liter of oil is topped up. MAX is indicated 
only after topping up a quantity of 1 liter. 

If the oil level is above maximum, the 
graphic appears with a yellow oil sump and 
an oil dipstick that represents the high oil 
level in yellow. 

A text message is also displayed for the 
driver.

Dynamic Oil Level Measurement During Vehicle Operation 



Always perform the dynamic oil level measurement (approx. 5 min¬ 
utes driving time) after an oil change. The oil level could be misinter¬ 
preted as the oil level last stored is initially displayed after an oil 
change. No oil level is initially stored after replacing or reprogram¬ 
ming the engine control unit. "Oil level below min" is therefore dis¬ 
played. The correct oil level is indicated after running the engine for 
approx. 5 minutes. 

1. Start engine. 

2. Select on-board computer 
function - “Check oil level". 

3. The oil level is measured. A clock 
symbol may appear while the level 
measurement is running. The clock 
symbol appears for up to 50 sec¬ 
onds after starting the engine when 
there is no measured value or the 
long-term value last stored is not 
within the tolerance range of the cur¬ 
rently measured oil level. 



Dynamic oil level measurement begins when following values are reached: 

• Engine temperature > 60°C 

• Engine speed > 1000 rpm 

• Transverse and longitudinal acceleration < 4-5 m/s2. 

The transverse acceleration signal is supplied by the DSC. The longitudinal acceler¬ 
ation is calculated from the speed and time factors. 

• Increase < 5% after covering a distance of approx. 200 m. The increase value is 
detected by the ambient pressure sensor in the ECM. 

On reaching this value, the oil level indicator is updated approx. 5 minutes after starting 
vehicle operation. The oil level is then continuously measured. The indicator is updated 
at 20 minute intervals. The "Check oil level" menu in connection with the dynamic oil 
level measurement is exited while driving (vehicle speed > 0) approx. 15 seconds after 
the oil level is displayed.

Oil level too low 


The oil level appears in the CID in the

Oil level too high 


The oil level appears in the CID in the 
form of a graphic together with the indica¬ 
tion that the maximum oil level has been 
exceeded. The excess engine oil must be 
extracted in the workshop down to the 
maximum limit. 

If no oil is extracted, this request will be 
repeated until the oil level drops below the 
maximum limit. This represents an 
advantage that extends beyond the user 
friendliness of the monitoring system. 

Over filling of the engine that can cause 
leaks is indicated as a warning in the 
instrument cluster.

There is a problem with the measurement 
system if SERVICE appears in the display. 
In this case, the oil level is forecast from 
the oil consumption last measured and 
shown in the display. It is not necessary to 
immediately visit a workshop. The remain¬ 
ing kilometers are shown in the service 
menu. In the event of the instrument clus¬ 
ter failing, the oil level can also be read out 
with the diagnosis tester.

Heat Management 


The engine control unit of the N54 engine controls the coolant pump according to 
requirements: 

• Low output in connection with low cooling requirements and low outside 
temperatures 

• High output in connection with high cooling requirements and high outside 
temperatures 

The coolant pump may also be completely switched off under certain circumstances, 
e.g. to allow the coolant to heat up rapidly during the warm-up phase. However, this 
only occurs when no heating is required and the outside temperature is within the per¬ 
mitted range. 

The coolant pump also operates differently than conventional pumps when controlling 
the engine temperature. To date, only the currently applied temperature could be 
controlled by the thermostat. 

The software in the engine control unit now features a calculation model that can take 
into account the development of the cylinder head temperature based on load. 

In addition to the characteristic map control of the thermostat, the heat management 
system makes it possible to use various maps for the purpose of controlling the coolant 
pump. For instance, the engine control unit can adapt the engine temperature to match 
the current operating situation. 

This means that four different temperature ranges can be implemented: 

• 108°C ECO mode 

• 104°C Normal mode 

• 95°C High mode 

• 90°C High + map-thermostat mode 

The control system aims to set a higher cylinder-head temperature (108°C) if the 
engine control unit determines ECO (economy) mode based on the engine perfor¬ 
mance. 

The engine is operated with relatively low fuel consumption in this temperature range as 
the internal friction is reduced. 


39 

Cooling Systems 




An increase in temperature therefore favors slower fuel consumption in the low load 
range. In HIGH and map-thermostat mode, the driver wishes to utilize the optimum 
power development of the engine. The cylinder-head temperature is reduced to 90°C 
for this purpose. This results in improved volumetric efficiency, thus increasing the 
engine torque. The engine control unit can now set a certain temperature mode adapted 
to the respective operating situation. Consequently, it is possible to influence fuel 
consumption and power output by means of the cooling system. 

The temperatures specified only ever represent a target value, the attainment of which is 
dependent on many factors. These temperatures are first and foremost not attained 
precisely. 

The consumption-reducing and power increasing effects arise in each case in a 
temperature spectrum. The function of the cooling system is to provide the optimal 
cooling output according to the boundary conditions under which the engine is being 
operated.

Intelligent Heat Management Options 

The previous section dealt with the various temperature ranges in which heat 
management is effected. However, an electrically driven coolant pump makes available 
even further options. For instance, it is now possible to warm up the engine without 
recirculating the coolant or to allow the pump to continue to operate after turning off the 
engine to facilitate heat dissipation. The advantages offered by this type of pump are 
listed in the following table: 


Consumption 

• Faster warm-up as coolant is not recirculated 
until needed 

• Increased compression ratio due to greater 
cooling output all full load as compared to simi¬ 
lar engines without this option 

Emissions 

• Faster engine warm-up by drastically reduced 
pump speed and the lower volumetric flow of 
coolant 

• Reduced friction 

• Reduced fuel consumption 

• Reduced exhaust emissions 

Power Output 

• Component cooling independent of engine 
speed 

• Reguirement controlled coolant pump output 

• Avoidance of power loss 

Comfort 

• Optimum volumetric flow 

- Heating capacity reduced as reguired 

- Residual heat with engine stationary 

Component Protection 

• After-running of electric coolant pump = 
improved heat dissipation from engine switch 
off point. Allows protection of turbochargers 
by reduced oil “coking” during heat soak.

System Protection 

In the event of the coolant or engine oil being subject to excessive temperatures while 
the engine is running, certain functions in the vehicle are influenced so that more energy 
is made available to the engine-cooling system, i.e. temperature-increasing loads are 
avoided. These measures are divided into two operating modes: 

• Component protection 

• Emergency
