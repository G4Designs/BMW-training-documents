Introduction 


BMW has introduced the new generation of sequential transmissions. The M Double- 
Clutch Transmission with Drivelogic (M DKG) GS7D36SG is available as an option on 
the entire E9x M3 series and is referred to as M DCT Drivelogic. 

The M double-clutch transmission combines the benefits of a sequential M transmission 
with that of an automatic. Like the SMG, it can be used in automatic mode "Drive" and 
in manual mode "Sequential". 

There are 5 Drivelogic programs in automatic “Drive” mode and 6 Drivelogic programs 
in “Sequential” mode. In sequential mode shifting can either be done with the new 
electronic sports shift lever, exclusive to the BMW M3, or with paddle shifters on the 
steering wheel. The main characteristic of this system is that there is no longer an 
interruption in driving force during the shifting operation. 

Shifting is controlled by the M DCT electronics and executed by the M DCT hydraulic 
components. These are combined into one mechatronics module and integrated into 
the transmission. The M DCT has a dedicated system to directly lubricate all of the 
relevant transmission components. The transmission oil temperature is regulated by 
a special two stage cooling system. 

An electric automatic parking lock has been integrated into the system. Selection of 
the driving programs and gears are controlled using the (M GWS) electric gear selector 
switch. Different driving modes and settings can be selected through the controller and 
the fifth settings menu of the CID (option dependent).

Principle of Operation 

The M DCT consists of two sub-transmissions, each with its own clutch. Clutch 1 with 
sub-transmission 1 and clutch 2 with sub-transmission 2. Sub-transmission 1 consists 
of the gears 1, 3, 5, 7 and Reverse while sub-transmission 2 consists of gears 2, 4 and 6. 
This means that the your next gear is always pre-selected in the other sub-transmission, 
regardless of whether you are shifting up or down (with the exception of "R"). 

For example, while still in the acceleration phase of the currently selected gear, if on sub¬ 
transmission 1 the next logical gear on sub-transmission 2 is engaged in advance, in a 
process similar to the Shift Overlap function of an automatic transmission. 

Precise control of the clutches when upshifting will allow the driving force to be 
transferred very quickly and smoothly from sub-transmission 1 to sub-transmission 2 
without an interruption in driving power. This results in significant benefits not only for 
the available driving force but also in terms of shift comfort. 

By combining the seamless driving force and comfort of the automatic with the 
direct connection to the engine as a manual, M DCT provides the benefits of both 
transmissions.

Operation 

The driving force is guided into the transmission by a central input shaft (1) 
through wet clutches 1 and 2, which are integrated into the transmission. 

Clutch 1 (2) transmits the power to inner input shaft 1 (5). 

Clutch 2 (3) transmits the power to inner input shaft 2 (4). 

The torque is then transferred to the output shaft (8) via the countershaft (6). 

The constant gears (7) are always engaged regardless of the gear selected. 
The countershaft and the output shaft are also always engaged. 

The respective gear pairs are selected via the sliding clutches (9). 

The 7th gear is the direct gear, the sliding clutch connects inner input shaft 1 
directly to the output shaft. 

The parking lock (10) is located directly on the output shaft.

Shifting Operation From 1st to 2nd Gear 


The following is a diagram demonstrating the shifting operation from 1st to 2nd gear with 
regulated transmission of the driving force between clutch 1 and clutch 2. 

2nd gear is already pre-selected, while the driver accelerates in first gear (not shown). 
During the first phase, clutch 2 begins to engage as clutch 1 begins to disengage. 


M DCT power flow 
route 1 st gear 






The greater portion of the driving force is still being transferred by clutch 1. The pressure 
on clutch 1 is still significantly higher than the increasing pressure on clutch 2.

to 2nd gear, first phase 





20

During the second phase, the driving force is distributed proportionally to clutch 2, which 
is engaging and clutch 1 which is disengaging. In this diagram both clutches have nearly 
the same pressure.

During the 3rd phase, clutch 2 carries the greater portion of the driving force, while clutch 
1 disengages further. The pressure on clutch 2 is now significantly higher than the 
decreasing pressure on clutch 1.

The driving force is transmitted from the dual-mass flywheel over the central input shaft 
and the external double-clutch housing into the M DCT. The oil pump drive gear is 
connected at this point to the central input shaft. 

There are four hydraulically operated selector rods and four sliding clutches, with one 
selector rod and one sliding clutch for each gear pair 4/6, 2/R, 1/3 and 5/7. Gears 1,2,3 
and Reverse are equipped with double taper synchronization and gears 4, 5, 6 and 7 with 
single taper synchronization. 

Carbon friction material is used for taper friction lining on all gears. The gear set 
assembly is mounted on three bearings that are evenly distributed along the length of 
the transmission shafts.

Automatic Parking Lock 

This is the first time that an integrated automatic parking lock has been used in an M 
vehicle. When the engine is turned off, there is no mechanical connection between 
engine and drive wheels (clutches are at zero pressure and disengaged).

There is no parking lock button on the selector lever of the M GWS. The parking lock 
position is determined by the M DCT electronics. The parking lock is engaged with the 
use of a parking lock electromagnet. This electromagnet is built into the gear selector 
switch housing and is activated directly by the M DCT electronics. It transfers its 
movement (stroke) to a Bowden cable. The parking lock Bowden cable transfers the 
movement directly to the external parking lock lever on the transmission and then to 
the inner parking lock lever.

28 

M DCT Drivelogic 






















The parking lock disengages hydraulically in the transmission. To engage the parking 
lock using the electromagnet, the parking lock hydraulic components must be at zero 
pressure. 

The parking lock will always be automatically engaged once the engine has been 
turned off, except in "N". 

When in "N" the parking lock is engaged: 

• when vehicle remote control is not in the ignition lock (Comfort Access) 

• when removing the remote control from the ignition lock 

• 30 minutes after the engine has been turned off. 


Note: At the carwash, before stopping the engine you must deliberately shift 
to "N" and leave the transmitter in the ignition lock. (With Comfort 
Access it must remain in the car or be inserted in the ignition lock). 


Emergency Release of Parking Lock 

In an emergency, the parking lock can be released by operating the emergency release 
mechanism. This is achieved releasing the mechanical connection between the GWS 
and M DCT. (See “Service Information”) 


CAUTION!!! 


If the parking lock is released the vehicle may roll. 


Note: The emergency release is described in detail in the Owner's Manual 
for the vehicle and in the Repair Instructions.

M DCTTransmission Sensors 

The following sensors are mounted in the transmission and their signals are sent directly 
to the M DCT electronics: 

• Input shaft 1 speed (Hall) sensor monitors rotation and direction of transmission 
shaft 1. 

• Input shaft 2 speed (Hall) sensor without rotation direction detection for the 
transmission shaft 2. 

• Clutch oil pressure (Piezo) sensors for clutch 1 and 2. 

• 3 temperature sensors (NTC), one for the ejected clutch oil and two redundant 
temperature sensors for the M DCT electronics. 

• 4 linear (Hall) sensors monitor the selector rod position. 

• 1 double (redundant) parking lock (Hall) sensor. 

The oil sump temperature is measured using a complex temperature map and checked 
against the temperature of the clutch oil by the M DCT electronics. 

Torque Intervention 

The M DCT mechatronics module sends a torgue reguirement to the engine control 
module on the PT-CAN in order to achieve a torgue intervention when shifting gear under 
load or when coasting. This is negative when upshifting so that the engine speed is 
reduced. When downshifting the torque intervention is positive, in order to increase the 
engine speed. Gear shifting is supported by the engine control module through this 
torque intervention strategy. 

LIN-bus Module 

There is a LIN-bus connection in the M DCT electronics for redundant communication 
with the gear selector switch (GWS).

Selector Lever Indicator and Function 


The shift pattern, driving program, gear selection indicator on the selector lever are all 
similar to that of the E6x M5/M6 with SMG. The main difference is that the selector lever 
on the gear selector switch in the E9x M3 no longer snaps into the "N" and "R" positions, 
instead it only snaps into "R". 

The M GWS selector lever is self centering as it returns back to its normal starting 
position on its own, after the driver selects the desired gear. Reverse gear is an 
exception; because once the shifter lever is moved left and into the "R" position the 
gear must be manually unselected by the driver. 

The shift pattern, driving program, gear selection indicator on the selector lever are all 
displayed in red, depending on the position of the selector lever and driving program 
selected. 

The indicator displays the currently selected driving program and the gear selection 
options. The indicator consists of the locating light that indicates the shift pattern and 
the function indicator lamp. These are two different red position LEDs that show the 
currently selected driving program and the gear selection options. 

The function indicator lamp in the M GWS is controlled by the M DCT electronics. The 
function indicator lamp is monitored, read back and compared with the required indicator 
for plausibility. 

In addition to the PT-CAN connection; there is a LIN-bus connection built in to the 
M GWS for redundant communication with the M DCT electronics. 


Selector Lever in the Start Position 

Except for when in the position "R", the selector 
lever always returns to the start position. 

When starting the engine the parking lock is 
always engaged and the clutches are both 
disengaged (zero oil pressure). The engine can 
be turned on regardless of the gear it was in 
when it was turned off. 

The selector lever indicator is displayed in red 
when in the start position. Driving program "D" 
Drive (automatic gear mode) is selected by briefly 
pushing the selector lever to the right, causing the 
M DCT, when in automatic gear mode, to change 
gears automatically into first (second) gear. The 
selector lever indicator "D/S" option is also 
displayed in red to indicate the start position. 



M GWS selector lever during 
and after starting the engine 


36 

M DCT Drivelogic 


The M GWS one-touch function is pushed to 
the right once to start automatic gear mode 



Driving Program "S" (Sequential Mode) 

By pressing the selector briefly to the right a 
second time the M DCT changes from automatic 
to sequential mode "S". 

If, while driving in 2nd to 6th gear, the driving 
program "S" is selected, then in addition to the 
"D/S", the "+" and will light up in red. 

The driver can now change to the next higher 
gear by briefly moving the selector lever 
backwards a notch or downshift by moving 
it briefly forward a notch. 

A desired gear shift may only be executed within 
the range of permissible engine speeds. There 
is no automatic up-shifting once the maximum 
speed has been reached. 

In automatic “Drive” mode, as soon as the selec¬ 
tor lever is moved towards the front, the back or a 
shift paddle on the steering wheel is activated, 
the M DCT switches to sequential mode.

start sequential mode.

In sequential mode there are two additional indicators, 
one for 1 st gear and one for 7th gear. 


Downshifting 

In 1 st gear the is no longer lit up in red, 

because it is no longer possible to downshift.

In 7th gear the "+" is no longer lit up in red, 
because it is not possible to shift higher.

38 

M DCT Drivelogic 




Gear Selection "N" Neutral 

The driver can consciously shift into neutral by 
pressing the selector lever briefly to the left. 

"N" will light up in red in the selector lever 
indicator. This is useful for example in a 
carwash. 



The M GWS one-touch function is 
pushed to the left to shift into neutral. 


Note: At the car wash, before stopping the engine you must deliberately shift 
to "N" and leave the transmitter in the ignition lock. (With Comfort 
Access it must remain in the car or be inserted in the ignition lock). 


Gear Selection "R" Reverse Gear 

When in this shift position, reverse gear is selected 
and the "R" will light up in red. 

If the engine is turned on while the selector lever 
position is in "R", the start position of the selector 
lever will flash red at one second intervals. This 
signals the driver that the Reverse gear is selected 
and that he must first return the shift lever to the 
(self centering) start position, in order to select a 
new gear or driving program.

Drivelogic Program Selection 


The controls and indicators in the vehicle are similar to the SMG II and SMG III vehicles. 

The Drivelogic program switch gives you the option of choosing between six driving 
programs in sequential mode and five driving programs in drive mode. 

The selected driving program is displayed as a bar chart in the instrument cluster. 

In sequential mode the switching speed is affected which has a direct effect on the 
shifting firmness. 

The sixth shift program can only be selected when the DSC function is de-activated. 

In drive mode the shift points and the shifting speed are affected, as a higher shift 
program means a higher gear changeover speed and thus a higher shifting speed. 

In addition to the Drivelogic program selection, the shift time is also dependent on the 
position of the accelerator pedal and how quickly it is operated.

M GWS Shifter Sensor System 

The selector lever position is detected with the use of Hall sensors. These are available 
mostly in groups of 2 or 4. In total there are 14 Hall sensors. This ensures maximum fault 
handling and diagnostic capacity.

Interface to the M DCT 

The selector lever position is transmitted through the PT-CAN and a LIN-bus. In the 
event of a failure of one of the two communication lines, a signal is still sent to the 
M DCT. 

The M GWS wake up is done by a high signal on the PT-CAN wake-up line. 

The M GWS itself has no active wake-up capabilities. The indicator on the selector lever 
is active as soon as bus communication is active on the PT-CAN or the LIN-bus.

Transmission Oil System 


Pressure and Flow Regulation 

A gear driven pump is integrated into the M DCT transmission and is responsible for 
circulating the oil through the unit. 

The transmission oil pump is driven by a gear on the drive input side which connects to 
the center input shaft of the M DCT. The engine must be running for the oil pressure to 
build up.

Note: Because transmission oil pressure cannot be built up when the engine 
is not running, a M DCT vehicle should never be push-started. 


42 

M DCT Drivelogic 





















The operating pressure is determined by a regulated control valve depending on the load 
and the function selected. The system is protected by a pressure relief valve in the pump. 

The pressure is regulated according to the following priorities: 

• Clutch engagement and disengagement 

• Gearchanges 

• Cooling the clutch 

• Lubrication cycle. 

The transmission oil pressure should be high enough to: 

• Be able to engage the clutches reliably. 

• Allow the gear selector rod to reach the required control shift speed. 

The normal operating pressure range is between 5 and 20 bar, although it can be 
increased up to 30 bar if necessary to maintain proper transmission operation. 

At maximum shifting force, the pressure required to operate the selector rods can be the 
same as the operating pressure. 

The pressure required for the clutches is limited to 18 bar. The clutch is regulated by an 
integrated proportioning valve. 

Overpressure protection is ensured by a pressure relief valve. 

Clutch cooling is map-controlled using a proportional valve. 

Note: The M DCT Drivelogic transmission has a new long-term rated oil, 

DCTF-1, which requires no replacement unless specified for a repair.

Hydraulic Emergency Operation 

If there is a fault, the M DCT has a hydraulic emergency operation mode. For example, if 
the power supply fails, the active gear remains selected and the active clutch engaged. 
This makes it possible to drive to the next possible vehicle storage location or parking 
area. The clutch disengages only when the engine speed goes below the minimum rpm 
and then it remains disengaged.

Two-stage Transmission Oil Cooling 



M DCTTransmission Cutaway Display 

(View of Two Stage Transmission Oil Cooling System) 


Oil to Coolant Cooling 

The M DCT transmission oil cooling circuit consists of an oil to coolant heat exchanger, 
an oil to air heat exchanger, a transmission oil thermostat and the relevant cooler lines. 
The oil to coolant heat exchanger is part of the engine cooling system of the vehicle. 
Mounted on the transmission housing it allows the oil to flow directly from the M DCT 
into the oil to coolant heat exchanger. 

Engine coolant directly from the cylinder head is pumped to the oil to coolant heat 
exchanger by the auxiliary coolant pump and then circulated back to the engine cooling 
system. The M DCT electronics can switch on the auxiliary coolant pump as needed. 
The auxiliary coolant pump, which is normally used to enhance the efficiency of the 
heating system, is used here to warm up the M DCT transmission. This design shortens 
the warm up time and maintains the transmission oil in the desired operating temperature 
range. 

After the oil to coolant heat exchanger has brought the temperature of the transmission 
oil to above 95°C/203°F, an oil thermostat directs the transmission oil to the oil to air heat 
exchanger located at the front of the vehicle.

Oil to Air Cooling 

An oil thermostat is used to direct the oil flow through the oil to air heat exchanger. There 
is a by-pass passage in bore of the oil thermostat which is located between the supply 
and the return flow from the oil to air heat exchanger. 


Oil “Warm-up” 

When the oil temperature is below 95°C 
(203°F), the oil by-pass passage in the 
thermostat is open. Oil flows out of the oil 
to coolant heat exchanger directly through 
the oil thermostat and back into the M DOT. 
This by-passes the oil to air heat exchanger 
completely and allows the system to reach 
operating temperature. 


M DCT oil thermostat at an oil temperature 
below 95 °C 


■ Oil “Cooling” 

When the oil temperature is above 95°C 
(203°F), the oil by-pass passage is closed 
by a thermal control valve in the oil 
thermostat. The hot oil is now directed to 
the oil to air heat exchanger for cooling 
before it flows back into the M DCT. 

This design enhances the overall thermal 
efficiency of the oil to air heat exchanger 
while maintaining the proper transmission 
oil operating temperature.

above 95 °C 


Note: In the event that the transmission oil temperature increases above the 
allowable limit, the engine torque is reduced and the maximum rpm is 
limited as a safety measure.
