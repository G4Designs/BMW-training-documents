N57TU Engine 
1. Introduction 


The N57TU engine is based on the N57 engine which was not available in the US but has been 
used in other markets for some time. The differences between the N57TU engine and N57 engine are 
essentially the same as the differences between the N47TU engine and N47 engine. This document 
deals exclusively with the adaptations/changes made with regard to the N57TU engine. The N57TU 
6 cylinder engine replaces the (M57D30T2) 6 cylinder which was first introduced to the US market in 
2009 with the E90 335d and the E70 xDrive35d. 

The N57TU engine was installed in the FI 0 535d and 535d xDrive 2014 models from 7/2013 
start production and was also installed on the new 2014 X5 model xDrive35d (FI 5) introduced in 
September of 2013.

The N47TU and the N57TU engine are considered second generation BMW diesel engines 
(in the US market). The exhaust after-treatment systems and components of the N47TU and 
the N57TU have been especially design to comply with current (ULEV II) US market emission 
regulations and thus differ from those used with the previous US diesel (M57D30T2) engine.

1.2. Engine identification 

1.2.1. Engine designation 

In the technical documentation, the engine designation is used to ensure unambiguous identification 
of the engine. Frequently, however, only a short designation is used. 

This short form is used so an engine can be identified as belonging to a specific engine family. The 
N57 engine family to which several engines, such as the N57D30T0, N57D3000, N57D30U0 and 
N57D30K0, belong is therefore frequently mentioned. The initial redesigned version is therefore 
referred to as the N57TU engine and is currently the only N57 available in the US market.

1.2.2. Engine identification 

The engines have an identification mark on the crankcase to ensure clear identification and 
classification. The engine identification is also required for approval by the authorities. The engine 
number can be found on the engine, above the engine identification. This consecutive number, in 
conjunction with the engine identification, permits clear and definite identification of each individual 
engine. The first six digits correspond to the engine designation.

2.1. Crankcase 

The aluminium crankcase of the N57TU engine is a new engineering design that is based on the 
crankcase of the N57 engine (not available in the US). This new design was necessary as the engine 
support required additional connection points. The oil pressure switch needed to be repositioned and 
a new oil passages for the oil module supply was required. In addition, the crankcase is exposed to 
higher loads due to the increased power of the N57TU engine family. This has been taken into account 
by making changes to details and geometry to enhance its strength. The familiar oil filter module 
(from the N47TU engine) with integrated engine and transmission oil coolers is also used. For more 
information, refer to “Oil supply”.

Loctite 5970 silicone gasket is used (no actual gasket is installed) on the sump and timing 
case cover of the rear wheel drive 535i models with the N57TU. 

The xDrive models with the N57TU use gaskets instead of the sealant. 


The special features of the N57TU engine crankcase are: 


• Crankcase made of aluminium. 

• Chain drive located on the force transmitting (flywheel) side. 

• Main bearing caps made of sintered metal. 

• Closed-deck design. 

• Main bearing pedestal with side walls that extend downwards 
and individual main bearing caps. 

• Main bearing caps with raised-profile joint face. 

• Dry, thermally joined, cast-iron cylinder liners. 

Additional crankcase rigidity is provided by a reinforcing plate bolted to the bottom of the crankcase. 
That reinforcing plate is required to cope with the lateral stresses that occur on the crankcase 
mounting attachment points when driving over a pothole. Without a reinforcing plate, the crankcase 
could break at the attachment points to the engine mounting bracket or at the junction between the 
bearing pedestal and the side wall. The reinforcing also provides benefits in terms of noise reduction.

2.2. Oil sump 

As with the N47TU the engine oil sump gasket surface was converted to use a silicone Loctite gasket 
5970. The oil sump of the N57TU (rear wheel drive model only) was machined with chamfer to 
use the silicone gasket. This chamfer is located on the inside of the flange, which serves as a defined 
reservoir for the excess silicone.

Axial bearing thrust surface 


Counterweights create a balance of inertial forces around the crankshaft so as to produce even 
rotation of the shaft. They are designed so as to counterbalance some of the oscillating (up-and-down) 
inertial forces as well as the rotational (revolving) inertial forces. 

The crankshaft of the N57TU engine has eight counterweights. 

The N57TU engine has a forged crankshaft made of C38modBY. BY stands for controlled cooling from 
the forging heat in the air and makes for uniform joints. The material specifications are the same as 
those of the (M57D30T2) engine. In order to achieve the required hardness, the crankshaft is induction 
hardened. This forms an especially hard surface layer approximately 1.5 mm thick. 

Advantages of forged crankshafts compared to cast: 

• Forged crankshafts are more rigid and have better vibrational properties. 

• Especially when combined with an aluminium crankcase, the crankshaft drive system must be 
as rigid as possible because the crankcase itself is made of material with a lower rigidity. 

• Forged crankshafts have better wearing characteristics at the bearing journals. 

In summary: the strength of a forged crankshaft is significantly greater than that of a cast one. A cast 
crankshaft would not be able to cope with the loads to which it is subjected in the N57TU engine.

2.4. Piston 

The pistons have been adapted to the new requirements due to the use of solenoid type injectors. The 
combustion chamber and injector are always harmonized with one another. 


2.5. Connecting rod 

The shaped hole in the small connecting rod eye is familiar technology that already features in the N55 
and N47TU engines. The shaped hole reduces edge load by allowing the force acting on the piston via 
the wrist pin to be distributed optimally across the surface of the cylinder liner.

The graphic on the following page shows (on the left side) the surface load for a normal connecting rod 
without a shaped bore. Due to the pressure on the piston, most of the force is transferred via the wrist 
pin to the edges of the small connecting rod eye bushing.

If a shaped hole is introduced into the small connecting rod eye (graphic on the right) the force is 
distributed across a larger surface and the load on the edge of the bushing reduces considerably. The 
force is now transmitted via a larger surface.

• Four valves per cylinder 

• Parallel valve arrangement (axes parallel with the cylinder axes)

The cylinder head of the N57TU engine largely matches the standards of the current diesel engines. A 
special feature, however, is that the cylinder head is comprised of two large cast parts. The camshafts 
are integrated inside their own camshaft carrier. In the case of the N57TU cylinder head, those 
two parts are the main casting of actual cylinder head, and a carrier plate for the camshafts. Both 
camshafts are mounted in this camshaft carrier. This design simplifies the manufacturing process.

The cylinder head gasket must be capable of sealing off four zones from each other. 


• Combustion chamber 

• Atmosphere 

• Engine oil passages 

• Coolant passages 

A three-layer metal gasket is used on the N57TU engine. 

The cylinder head gasket is available to order in three different thicknesses, which depend on the 
piston projection concerned. The thickness of the cylinder head gasket is indicated by holes, whereby 
one hole indicates the thinnest and three holes the thickest gasket.

N57TU Engine 
2. Engine Mechanical 

When the engine is running, blow-by gases escape from the cylinders into the crankshaft cavity. Those 
blow-by gases contain unburned fuel and all the constituents of the exhaust. In the crankshaft cavity, 
they mix with the engine oil that is present in the form of oil vapor. 

The extent of blow-by is dependent on load. Pressure is created inside the crankshaft cavity and, due 
to the motion of the pistons, is also dependent on engine speed. This overpressure is also present in 
all spaces that connect to the crankshaft cavity (e.g. oil return, chain cavity, etc.) and if not released 
would force oil out through the sealed joints. 

The crankcase venting system prevents that from happening. It channels blow-by gases that are 
largely free of engine oil into the filtered-air pipe upstream of the turbocharger. The separated engine 
oil droplets work their way back into the sump through an oil return pipe. The crankcase venting 
system also ensures that excess pressure is not created in the crankcase. 

The N57 engine is equipped with a vacuum controlled crankcase venting system with a regulated 
negative pressure of about 38 mbar (maintained). 

Pre-loaded metal spring plates (known as variable-aperture separators) regulate the air mass flow rate, 
thereby ensuring optimum oil separation from the blow-by gas in all engine operating situations. 

A negative pressure is created in the purified air pipe due to the suction of the exhaust turbocharger. 

As a result of the pressure difference relative to the crankcase, the blow-by gas is drawn into the 
cylinder head. 

In the cylinder head, the blow-by gas first enters the plenum chamber. The purpose of the plenum 
chamber is to ensure that no oil spray, e.g. from the camshafts, enters the crankcase venting system. 
Thus, a degree of initial separation already takes place in the plenum chamber. The oil that deposits on 
the wall here flows back into the cylinder head. 

The blow-by gas flows from the plenum chamber to the spring-plate separators. The spring plates are 
forced open by the flow of blow-by gas so that the blow-by gas passes through. Since the aperture 
size is relatively small, the flow velocity of the blow-by gas is accelerated. And since the blow-by gas 
flow is then deflected by about 180°, the fluid contained in the blow-by gas is thrown against the 
surrounding walls by centrifugal force and runs down them into a drain channel and back into the 
sump. The spring plates are opened to a greater (B) or lesser (A) degree depending on the quantity 
of blow-by gas so that optimum oil separation is achieved regardless of blow-by gas flow rate. The 
spring-plate separator has brought about an improvement in the separation quality under all operating 
conditions but especially at low blow-by gas flow rates. The cleaned blow-by gas flows through the 
pressure regulating valve and into the filtered-air pipe upstream of the turbocharger.

2.9. Camshaft drive system 

The special features and specifications of the chain drive system on the N57TU engine are as follows: 

• Chain drive system mounted on flywheel side of engine. 

• Two-section system for driving the high pressure pump and camshafts. 

• Use of simplex sleeve-type chains. 

• Oil/vacuum pump driven by second chain. 

• Plastic tensioning and guide rails. 

• Hydraulic chain tensioners. 

As on the N47TU engine, the chain drive system on the N57TU engine is mounted on the flywheel 
end, i.e. the rear, of the engine. Due to the fact that the timing gear is mounted at the rear, the engine 
is lower at the front. This is of benefit for the passive safety features for minimizing pedestrian impact 
severity. It creates more space between the engine and the hood. Thus, in the event of a crash, there 
is more room for the hood to deform and absorb the impact therefore minimizing the injury to the 
pedestrian. Another benefit is that rotational vibrations are significantly reduced due to the inertial 
mass of the transmission at this end. This results in an enormous relief of load on the chain drive. One 
of the consequences of this arrangement is that various components are installed in unconventional 
locations or positions, e.g. oil pump, camshaft sensor, etc.

Gear and camshaft sensor wheel 


The intake camshaft is driven by a sprocket which is chain-driven by the crankshaft. The exhaust 
camshaft is driven by direct gear-to-gear transmission from the intake camshaft. The camshaft gears 
are integral components of the camshafts and are permanently attached to them. Markings on the 
camshaft gears facilitate the correct positioning of the camshafts relative to one another when fitting. 
The intake camshaft gear also has raised lugs so that it serves simultaneously as the reluctor ring for 
the camshaft sensor. The twin-flatted collar for accepting the special tool for positioning the camshaft 
relative to the crankshaft when fitting is integral with the camshaft. On the N57TU engine, the special 
tool is only placed on the exhaust camshaft. 



N57TU timing gear alignment 


The camshaft sprocket is bolted to the camshaft gear of the intake camshaft. Slots are provided for 
adjusting the valve timing. A new feature is that the sprocket can be bolted in place without turning the 
camshaft out of position. To that end, the three bolts are not spaced evenly 120° apart (see graphic 
above). To brace the camshaft when fitting the sprocket, an Allen-key socket in the center of the 
camshaft gear on the exhaust camshaft is used.

The component carrier with optimized connection to crankcase is also new. As the intake of the 
differentiated air intake system has been moved to the front of the engine, the assemblies had to be 
moved down. Less installation space is now available for the belt tensioner and the assemblies due to 
this downwards displacement. 

The direction of rotation of the air conditioning compressor has also been reversed as a result of 
these changes. The deflecting element is mounted on the belt tensioner. The belt tensioner features a 
hexagon head so it can be locked and unlocked. The new belt guide has been introduced as a result of 
these changes and the belt provides support on one side only. It has also been possible to reduce the 
belt tensioning force by around 100 Nm.

4. Oil Supply 

4.1. Oil circuit 

The N57TU engine is equipped with a forced-feed lubrication system. The system corresponds to the 
design and operation of the N47TU lubrication system. 

In a forced-feed lubrication system, the oil pump takes in oil from the sump through an intake pipe and 
pumps it onwards into the circuit. The oil flows through the full-flow oil filter and then passes into the 
main oil channel, which runs parallel to the crankshaft in the engine block. Branch galleries lead to the 
main bearings of the crankshaft. The crankshaft has corresponding holes to feed oil from the main 
bearings to the crank pins and connecting rod journals. Part of the oil is branched off from the main oil 
gallery and fed to the corresponding lubrication points in the cylinder head. The oil ultimately returns 
to the sump. Either it passes through return channels or it simply drips back there freely.

4.2. Oil pump 


The oil pump takes the oil from the oil pan via the intake pipe or oil pickup pipe. The intake pipe is 
positioned such that the intake opening is below the oil level under all operating conditions. The intake 
pipe is fitted with an oil screen that keeps coarse dirt particles away from the oil pump. The intake pipe 
is a separate component and is bolted onto the oil pump. 

As with the N47TU engine, the N57TU also combines the oil and vacuum pump which are also chain- 


driven by the crankshaft.

Oil/vacuum pump sprocket 


The oil pump plays a central role in the N57TU engine, as it does in all modern combustion engines. 
The high power and enormous torque produced (even at low engine speeds) demand that a high rate 
of oil flow is ensured. This is necessary for reasons of high component temperatures and bearings 
being subjected to high loads. On the other side, a demand-oriented oil pump is required in order to 
achieve low fuel consumption. There are different types of oil pumps to meet these requirements. The 
N57TU engine uses the gear-type oil pump familiar from the N47TU engine. 

The oil pump (OP) on the N57TU engine is driven by a chain running off the crankshaft (CS) with a 
gear ratio of I = 21:23 (CS:OP); its theoretical delivery rate is 18.6 cm3 per revolution of the oil pump. 
The delivery rate of the N47TU oil pump is 16 cm3 per oil-pump revolution. The higher delivery rate 


29 













N57TU Engine 

4. Oil Supply 

compared to the N47TU engine has been achieved by a wider gear set and a different gear ratio. On 
the N57TU engine, the oil pump forms a single unit with the vacuum pump. Both pumps share the 
drive of the crankshaft, but they are separate in their function. 

The reason for the unusual installation location of the vacuum pump is to reduce the engine height 
dimension. It was designed in this manner with passive pedestrian safety in mind. The pump is a vane- 
type pump with aluminium housing (AISi9Cu3) with a steel rotor and a plastic vane. It is chain-driven 
together with the oil pump by the crankshaft (See the Vacuum system section for more information) 

4.2.1. Pressure limiting valve 

The pressure limiting valve protects against excessively high oil pressure, e.g. when starting the 
engine with the oil cold. It protects the oil pump, oil pump drive, oil filter and oil cooler. The pressure 
limiting valve is located on the pressure side between the oil pump and oil filter. On the N57 engine, 
it is located in the oil pump body. The opening/limit pressure on the N57 engine is 3.7 bar at an oil 
temperature of 100 °C and an engine speed of 4,000 rpm.

Pressure side 


The pressure limiting valve on the N57TU has a special feature. On previous diesel engines, oil acted 
on the pressure limiting valve downstream of the filter. The oil acts on the pressure limiting valve, not 
only downstream of the filter, but also immediately downstream of the pump. 

The oil is taken in by the spur-gear oil pump and delivered to the pressure side (9). A duct carries oil (1) 
from the pressure side (9) to upper control chamber (4) of the pressure limiting valve, causing pressure 
to build up downstream of the oil pump and upstream of the oil filter. The remaining oil flows through 
unfiltered oil duct (2) to the oil filter and finally into the main oil duct. Oil returns to the oil pump housing 
through clean oil duct (3) and from there supplies lower control chamber (5) of the pressure limiting 
valve through an oil bore. As a result, the system pressure of the oil circuit is present in the control 
chamber (downstream of the oil filter). 

The control chambers are located on one side by control piston (6), which is acted on by a return 
spring (7).

At low oil pressure, the pressure limiting valve is closed. 



Pressure limiting valve closed 

At low oil pressures, the pressure limiting valve is closed. The spring force of the return spring 
determines the opening pressure of the pressure limiting valve. If the system pressure in the oil circuit 
increases, and thus in the control chamber, the control piston is moved against the spring force. Due 
to the special shape of the control piston, a connection between the pressure side of the spur-gear oil 
pump and the intake section is opened. 


32 







N57TU Engine 

4. Oil Supply 



Pressure limiting valve open 

The oil circuit is for all intents and purposes closed briefly. As a consequence of the pressure ratios, 
a certain amount of oil flows from the pressure side and into the intake section. The more the control 
piston opens, the greater the volume of oil that flows away. This causes a drop of pressure in the 
system. Since the control piston is opened by system pressure, there is a return to equilibrium. In that 
way, the pressure in the system cannot exceed a desired maximum limit which is determined by the 
force of the compression spring. 

The reason why oil acts on the control piston directly downstream of the pump and also downstream 
of the filter is because: 

• The valve is connected to the oil circulation system downstream of the filter, it is subjected 
to the actual oil pressure in the system and not the pressure between the oil pump and the 
filter. If the oil filter is dirty, the pressure downstream of the filter drops, whereas the pressure 
directly downstream of the pump increases. If the pressure limiting valve were to respond 
only to the pressure downstream of the pump, it would open in that situation even though the 
maximum system pressure had not been reached. In extreme cases, this could result in a lack 
of oil at lubricating points. 

• If the control piston were to be controlled only by oil downstream of the oil filter, a very 
high pressure would build up in the engine oil circuit during a cold start (at extremely low 
temperatures and thus with a correspondingly viscous oil) until the oil reached the pressure 
limiting valve and the pressure were regulated down. The high pressure could lead to damage 
of components and, due to the increased drive output required for the oil pump, also cause a 
deterioration in the starting characteristics of the engine. 

The superimposed two pressures at the pressure limiting valve helps to achieve optimum component 
protection and, at the same time, ensure a reliable supply of lubricating points and good cold-start 
characteristics.

4.3. Oil filter module 

The oil filter module of the N57TU can also be found in the N47TU engine. This is a further example of 
BMW using more and more common parts across vehicle platforms. The only discernible difference 
between this and versions installed in other engines is that the engine oil-to-coolant heat exchanger or 
transmission oil-to-coolant heat exchanger on the oil filter module varies. The housing with all valves, 
filter element, gaskets and retaining elements remains the same. In addition, the transmission oil-to- 
coolant heat exchanger has been integrated for the first time.

Filter bypass valve 

When a filter is blocked, the filter bypass valve ensures that engine oil reaches the lubrication points of 
the engine. It opens when the differential pressure upstream and downstream of the oil filter is 2.5 bar 
± 0.3 bar. 

Thermostat for transmission oil 

A thermostat that controls the transmission oil temperature is also integrated in the oil filter module. 
Transmission oil flows round the transmission oil thermostat. If the temperature of the transmission 
oil rises to > 88 °C (190 °F), the transmission oil thermostat opens to allow coolant to pass from the 
low-temperature cooler of the cooling system to the transmission oil-to-coolant heat exchanger. At 
the same time, the transmission oil thermostat blocks the cooling circuit that runs from the cylinder 
crankcase via the auxiliary heating thermostat for transmission oil. The transmission oil is now cooled. 

Non-return valve 

The non-return valve ensures that the engine oil ducts and oil filter housing do not run empty when the 
engine is at a standstill. It opens the inlet of the oil pump when the pressure exceeds 0.1 bar ± 0.03 bar. 

Auxiliary heating thermostat for transmission oil 

An important new feature is the auxiliary heating thermostat which is integrated into the oil filter 
housing and ensures that the transmission oil heats up more rapidly. When the engine coolant 
temperature is < 80 °C the transmission oil auxiliary heating thermostat is closed. Coolant does not 
flow through the transmission oil-to-coolant heat exchanger. 

When the engine coolant temperature reaches > 80 °C, the transmission oil auxiliary thermostat opens 
and allows coolant to flow from the engine via the transmission oil thermostat thus allowing the warm 
coolant to heat up the transmission oil. 

Advantages for the transmission: 

• Heated with excess engine heat 

• Warms up more quickly 

• Lower friction loss 

• Higher degree of shifting comfort is available much more quickly 


Heat exchanger bypass valve 

The heat exchanger bypass valve has the same function as the filter bypass valve. If the oil pressure 
increases as a result of a blocked oil-to-water heat exchanger, the heat exchanger bypass valve opens 
at a pressure of 2.5 ± 0.3 bar thus allowing un-cooled oil to reach the lubricating points. 

Discharge valve 

The discharge valve is integrated on the oil filter and is thus changed when the oil filter is replaced.

emission controls which is also used with the N47TU. There are however some differences, especially 
with regard to the Low pressure EGR system (not installed on the 4 cylinder).

5.1. Intake air system 

The most obvious changes are those that have been made to the intake air system. The throttle valve 
is now located at the front on the engine. The intake air system has been modified, which means it 
has also been possible to reduce the line length as the charge air from the charge air cooler is now 
introduced into the differentiated air intake system (4) at the front of the engine directly via the throttle 
valve (2) and mixing tube (3). 

A resonator is installed at the output of the exhaust turbocharger in the section that leads to the 
charge air cooler. The resonator optimizes exhaust-gas turbocharger noise.

The differentiated air intake system has been redeveloped in order to meet the requirements brought 
about by the changes to the charge air routing. The exhaust-gas recirculation cooler is now therefore 
connected directly to the differentiated air intake system. With the N57 engine, the exhaust-gas is still 
recirculated via the cylinder head into the differentiated air intake system. 

The swirl flaps have also been modified. Up till now, the swirl flaps were integrated in the differentiated 
air intake system. If the swirl flaps or the swirl flap mechanism developed a fault or were damaged, it 
was necessary to replace the entire differentiated air intake system. 

The swirl flaps are now integrated in the gasket between the differentiated air intake system and the 
cylinder head. The gasket has a three-dimensional construction and is clipped onto the differentiated 
air intake system. 

A 

When mounting the gasket, the swirl flaps must be in the correct position as they will 
otherwise be damaged when the differentiated air intake system is installed on the cylinder 
head.

A vacuum pump creates the vacuum for use by the engine systems. The negative pressure is 
connected to the vacuum canister of each control components. The vacuum canister converts the 
negative pressure into motion. Electro-pneumatic changeover valves (EUV) are used to connect the 


46

vacuum to the vacuum canister to operate the components which are ultimately controlled electrically 
vie the DDE. A non-return valve prevents the vacuum from being lost through the vacuum pump when 
the engine is switched off. 


5.2.1. Vacuum pump 

The vacuum pump on the N57TU engine is fitted inside the sump and forms a single unit together with 
the oil pump and the reinforcing plate. The reason for the unusual installation location is to reduce the 
engine height dimension. It was designed in this manner with passive pedestrian safety in mind. 

The pump is a vane-type pump with aluminium housing (AISi9Cu3) with a steel rotor and a plastic 
vane. It is chain-driven together with the oil pump by the crankshaft. 

The vacuum pump is capable of creating a vacuum of 500 mbar (absolute) in less than 5 seconds. The 
negative pressure duct passes through the oil pump housing and the crankcase. At the outlet of the 
crankcases, the main negative pressure line is connected to the brake force amplifier and the other 
consumers. Mounted directly on that connection is the non-return valve.

The electro-pneumatic changeover valve (EUV) has connections for vacuum and ambient pressure. 
The vacuum in the system is connected through to the vacuum canister according to the control 
signals from the digital diesel engine management. A simple "on/off" control mode is used. On the 
N57TU engine, the EGR cooler bypass valve and the controllable engine mounts are switched by an 
electro-pneumatic changeover valve.

5.3.1. Exhaust turbocharger (VNT) 

The variable geometry exhaust turbocharger of the N57TU is referred to as a Variable Nozzle Turbine 
(VNT) and is also installed in the N47TU engine. Variable nozzle turbine makes it possible to alter the 
gas flow that drives the turbine wheel in relation to the engine operating point by varying the cross- 
flow section in the turbine wheel inlet housing using variable guide vanes. 



VNT vanes open 


50 











N57TU Engine 

5. Intake Air, Exhaust and Emission Sys. 



The variable nozzle vanes (located inside the turbine housing) are arranged completely around the 
turbine wheel. These VNT actuator vanes move in unison to vary the cross-flow section (see graphic 
on the next page) directing the exhaust gas flow and angle of attack to turn the turbine wheel. As the 
flow rate of the exhaust gas and the exhaust gas pressure acting on the turbine wheel increases, the 
transfer of energy to the turbine wheel and compressor is therefore increased, enhancing efficiency 
particularly at low engine speeds. 

These vanes are adjusted by the (electrically controlled) boost pressure regulator (VNT actuator). As 
the turbine speed and boost pressure are directly dependent on the position of the actuator vanes 
and this is regulated by the DDE via the boost pressure regulator (VNT actuator) there is no need for a 
wastegate valve. 


51 



N57TU Engine 

5. Intake Air, Exhaust and Emission Sys. 

When the VNT vanes are in the “closed” position (see graphic below) the transfer of energy to 
the turbine wheel and compressor is increased due to an increase in exhaust gas pressure and an 
optimum angle of attack. This results in maximum turbine speed and boost pressure (especially at low 
engine speeds). This increase in boost pressure allows for a higher injection rate to be authorized by 
the DDE. 



VNT vane mechanism “closed” 


52 


N57TU Engine 

5. Intake Air, Exhaust and Emission Sys. 

When the VNT vanes are in the “open” position (see graphic below) the transfer of energy to the 
turbine wheel and compressor is decreased as the flow rate and exhaust gas pressure driving the 
turbine decreases. This is due to a reduction in exhaust gas pressure and a less than optimum angle of 
attack which results in a decrease in turbine speed and boost pressure. 

Therefore as the engine speed increases, the vanes are gradually opened so that the energy transfer 
always remains in equilibrium at the desired boost-pressure depending on engine speed and load 
requirements. 



VNT vane mechanism “open” 

The boost-pressure regulator (VNT actuator) is controlled by the DDE by means of a pulse-width 
modulated signal. 

A control rod turns the adjustment ring, which in turn moves the VNT actuator vanes. 

The VNT provides an additional degree of freedom in the optimization of thermodynamic behavior by 
comparison with a conventional exhaust turbocharger (which has a permanently constant cross-flow 
section) with the additional benefit that the VNT turbocharger does not need a wastegate valve. 

The control of the boost-pressure regulator is described in more detail in the “Engine electrical 
system” section of this training material. 


53 



N57TU Engine 

5. Intake Air, Exhaust and Emission Sys. 


Advantages of VNT system: 

• High torque at both high and low engine speeds. 

• Continuous and optimum adjustment for all engine speeds. 

• No "wastegate valve" required, the exhaust energy is better utilized, less back-pressure in 
conjunction with the same compressor work. 

• Low thermal and mechanical load facilitates improved optimization of engine power output. 

• Low emission values also at very low engine speeds. 

• Optimized fuel consumption over the entire engine speed spectrum. 

Boost pressure control 



N57TU engine, VNT actuator control 


The variable nozzle vanes of the (VNT) are adjusted electrically via the boost pressure regulator 
also referred to as VNT actuator. This achieves a more accurate regulation of the boost pressure in 
comparison with vacuum regulated systems. The VNT boost pressure regulator controls the boost 
pressure up to 2.2 bar absolute pressure (N57). The servomotor is controlled by the DDE via a PWM 
signal. The position regulator and the diagnostics function are integrated in the servomotor. In the 
event of a malfunction, the PWM signal from the internal position regulation of the servomotor is 
directed to ground for 0.5 to 2 seconds (depending on the fault message). From this, the DDE detects 
a fault with the electrical vane adjustment. 

The control rod is not designed to be adjustable. The control rod is installed on the shaft of the 
adjustment lever for the VNT vanes and the VNT actuator.

The exhaust-gas recirculation has been optimized and its geometry has been modified so that the 
exhaust gases are introduced into the differentiated air intake system either cooled or un-cooled 
(depending on operating temperature). The exhaust gases are introduced into the differentiated air 
intake system via an exhaust-gas recirculation pipe that projects into the mixing tube at the end of 
which a plate is fitted to prevent hot exhaust gases from damaging the mixing tube. 

As with the previous 6 cylinder US market engine (M57D30T2) the N57TU also uses a Low pressure 
EGR system especially in combination with heavier vehicles as X5 models. Please refer to the “Diesel 
Technology” training material available on TIS and ICP for more information.

5.3.3. EGR valve/actuator 

The exhaust-gas recirculation valve actuator is opened or closed electrically by the DDE control 
unit. To ensure optimized control of the exhaust-gas recirculation rate, the exact position must be 
continuously detected. The position of the exhaust-gas recirculation actuator is monitored by a non- 
contact hall effect sensor. The servomotor for the exhaust-gas recirculation actuator is a direct current 
motor. The position sensor is a hall effect sensor. The hall effect sensor determines the revolutions of 
the servomotor. This is used to calculate the position of the exhaust-gas recirculation actuator.

The exhaust after-treatment systems and components of the N47TU and the N57TU have 
been especially design to comply with current (ULEV II) US market emission regulations and 
thus are different from those used with the previous US diesel (M57D30T2) engine. 


A more powerful system for exhaust gas treatment is required to meet increasingly stringent 
emissions regulations in spite of lower exhaust temperatures with high efficiency diesel engines. 

Where the pervious system used an oxidation catalyst there is now a NOx Storage Catalyst (NSC) 
installed. The NSC is a NOx adsorption (storage) catalyst which incorporates the precious metals 
Platinum, Palladium and Rhodium and is installed in the same housing as the Diesel Particulate Filter 
(DPF). 


58 


































N57TU Engine 

5. Intake Air, Exhaust and Emission Sys. 

There is also now an additional O 2 sensor (downstream of the DPF). It is used to monitor the function 
of the NSC and to determine whether it needs to be regenerated. 

In addition, for the first time there is also a particulate matter sensor (located down stream of the SCR) 
to monitor the actual particulate matter (soot) that escapes the system at all times. This sensor is used 
to determine and manage the efficiency of the diesel particulate filter (DPF) in order to maintain the 
soot emission levels well below the mandated guidelines. 

The combination of a NOx Storage Catalyst (NSC) and SCR catalyst has significant advantages for the 
exhaust gas after-treatment due to the efficiency of the NSC especially under lean conditions. 

The new system also incorporates the second generation SCR system (SCR 2). The system now uses 
a dosing control unit (DCU) to monitor and deliver the AdBlue fluid into the SCR system and several 
redesigned components.

N57TU Engine 
6. Fuel Preparation 

The fuel preparation system is the system which provides and meters the correct amount of fuel for 
combustion. 

Although the fuel preparation has been modified when compared to the M57 (US engine). It is very 
similar to that used on the N47TU engine with the main difference being the larger 2 piston CP4.2 high 
pressure pump used. 

The main functions of the fuel preparation system are: 

• Providing the required pressure 

• Injecting the required fuel quantity (fuel quantity control) 

• Setting the required start of injection (injection start control). 

In order to comply with the more stringent emission limits for diesel engines, modern injection 
systems inject with ever higher pressures and with ever greater precision. The common rail system 
satisfies these requirements to optimum effect. In the common rail system the fuel is stored in the 
rail under high pressure and is injected via injectors on a map-controlled basis into the combustion 
chambers. 

The fuel preparation system is comprised of the fuel rail and the following main components: 

• High pressure pump (CP 4.2) 

• Leakage oil line 

• Injectors 

These features correspond to the features of the N47TU engine.

The injection system primarily comprises: 

• Low-pressure area: The low-pressure area is divided into the fuel feed and the fuel return. 

• High-pressure area: The high-pressure area contains the high-pressure pump, the high 
pressure lines, the rail and the injectors. 

• Electronic control: The electronic control comprises the sensors and actuators such as 
the fuel filter heating, the fuel pressure/temperature sensor, the rail pressure sensor, the fuel 
quantity control valve and the injectors. 


6.1. High pressure pump 

The function of the high-pressure pump is to bring the fuel from the fuel supply to the required 
pressure level in line with the current demand. This must be performed in all operating ranges and over 
the entire service life. The high-pressure pump permanently generates the system pressure for the rail 
(high-pressure accumulator). It is based on the design and operation of the CP4.1 single piston pump 
used on the N47TU engine. 

The N57TU engine is fitted with a twin-piston high pressure pump with the designation CP4.2. 

The high-pressure pump is located on the flywheel side (rear) of the engine and is driven via the timing 
chain by the crankshaft with 1:1 ratio. Although it is capable of generating a pressure of 2000 bar, the 
N57TU uses 1800 bar of injection fuel pressure. 

The gear ratio from the crankshaft to the high-pressure pump is chosen so that fuel delivery is 
synchronized with combustion. That means that at the point of fuel injection into the cylinder, fuel is 
always simultaneously pumped into the fuel rail, thereby reducing fluctuations in fuel-rail pressure and, 
therefore, in injection pressure. 

A_ 

When work is carried out on the chain drive, the high-pressure pump in the N57TU engine 
must be positioned in relation to the crankshaft. Refer to the repair instructions for the exact 
procedure.

N57TU High pressure pump Bosch CP4.2 


The power required to drive the CP4 has been reduced by 20% compared with the CP3 by introducing 
roller tappets. 

For lubrication of the high-pressure pump, fuel enters through the inlet connection (10) from the fuel 
feed (A) and passes into the camshaft chamber (16). The fuel passes via the bearing sleeve (17) and 
return channels (12) to the outlet connection (9) and back into the fuel return (C). 

A fuel overflow valve (11) also returns excess pumped fuel to the fuel return (C) via the outlet 
connection (9). From the camshaft chamber, the fuel passes via the low-pressure channel (22) to the 
volume control valve (24) and as a regulated flow from there through another low-pressure channel (1) 
to the valve seat (5). The spring (21) acts against the tappet (20), and indirectly the piston (23), so that 
the roller (13) is held in contact with the twin-lobe cam (15). The spring force is strong enough to keep 
the tappet roller in contact with the twin-lobe cam in all operating situations. 

When the tappet and the piston are moved downwards by the force of the spring (4), the valve poppet 
(2) is forced open by the pressure of the incoming fuel and/or the pressure drop created by the 
downward movement of the piston. The fuel can then flow into the cylinder. When the piston moves 
upwards, the valve closes again and the pressure inside the cylinder rises. When the pressure in the 
cylinder reaches the required high fuel pressure (B), the ball (6) is forced back against the force of the 
spring (7) and the fuel-rail pressure. The fuel can then be delivered to the fuel rail via the high-pressure 
connection (8).

6.1.1. Fuel quantity control valve 


il 


Fuel quantity control valve CP4.2 

The fuel-quantity control valve (also known as flow regulating valve) is mounted on the CP4.2 high- 
pressure pump . The fuel-quantity control valve is controlled using a pulse-width-modulated signal. 
The DDE controls the fuel-quantity control valve at various pulse-duty factors while the fuel-quantity 
control system is active. The system adjust rail pressure to the specified level as calculated by the 
DDE. The fuel-quantity control valve regulates the fuel flow from the low-pressure side to the high- 
pressure side of the high-pressure pump. This is how the desired fuel-rail pressure is achieved. 
Progressive reductions in the amount of fuel that the fuel-quantity control valve allows to flow to the 
high-pressure side produce corresponding reductions in the level to which the high-pressure pump 
charges the cylinders. The consequence is that less rail pressure is built up. The high-pressure pump 
generates pressure to maintain a constant level in the rail. 

Two valves are employed to maintain the pressure within the fuel rail at the required level: 

• Fuel quantity control valve 

• Rail-pressure control valve (see corresponding description of operation) 

When volumetric flow regulation is active, the DDE controls the fuel-quantity control valve (flow 
regulating valve) by means of a variable pulse duty factor in order to set the rail pressure to the level 
calculated by the DDE. The fuel-quantity control valve controls the flow of fuel into the high pressure 
pump from the low-pressure side, thereby controlling fuel-rail pressure as required. The less fuel the 
flow regulating valve allows to flow into the high pressure side, the less the radial cylinder of the high- 
pressure pump is filled. The consequence is that less rail pressure is built up.

The fuel quantity control valve is activated by the Digital Diesel Electronics with pulse-width 
modulation according to the calculated fuel requirement. On activation the tappet (6) is moved by 
the armature (7) actuated by magnetic force. The plunger (3) is displaced by the tappet. The plunger 
is pressed by the spring (2) against the tappet. The plunger, depending on its position, opens the 
fuel supply (11). This fuel quantity control reduces the power demand of the high-pressure pump. It 
delivers only the amount of fuel needed to generate the rail pressure determined from a characteristic 
map. The graphic below shows the plunger in its closed state (3b) and the associated tappet (6b). Also 
shown are the plunger in its opened state (3a) and the associated tappet (6a).

6.1.2. Volumetric flow regulation functional description 

Depending upon conditions, one of the following 3 available closed-loop control strategies is used to 
adjust the rail pressure to the correct level: 

• Volumetric flow regulation by the quantity control valve: The quantity control valve only 
allows the amount of fuel to flow into the high pressure pump from the low-pressure side 
that is required in order to generate the required fuel rail pressure. The high-pressure pump 
cylinder is not completely filled with fuel. The higher the control signal current, the lower the 
rail pressure that is generated. The rail-pressure regulating valve is not supplied with current 
for the maximum pressure. The rail-pressure regulating valve is supplied with slightly higher 
current than would be necessary for setting the target pressure. 

• Pressure regulation by the rail pressure control valve: The high-pressure pump provides a 
constant supply of highly-pressurised fuel to the rail. The rail pressure regulating valve diverts 
excess fuel arriving in the rail into the return line. The higher the control signal current, the 
higher the rail pressure that is maintained. The flow regulating valve is set to maximum flow. 

• Combined closed-loop control with simultaneous regulation from the rail pressure regulating 
valve and the quantity control valve: At extremely low fuel-injection quantities of less than 
roughly 4 mg (on trailing throttle/overrun) the rail pressure regulating valve must discharge a 
certain amount of fuel from the high-pressure system. The reason is that the high-pressure 
pump cannot run with zero delivery. This means that the high-pressure pump supplies fuel 
to the high-pressure system even when the quantity control valve (flow regulating valve) is 
closed. This would lead to excessive rail pressure and thus to a control deviation. 

The two control methods are used under the following engine operating conditions: 

• During engine starts: Pressure regulation is always active. 

• When the engine is running: At a coolant temperature below 1 °C (34 °F), the pressure 
regulation is always active. Once the coolant temperature rises above 15 °C (59 °F) the 
combined closed-loop control system assumes operation. 

Fault handling 

If activation of the flow regulating valve is interrupted or has a short circuit to ground, the flow 
regulating valve switches to full delivery. The DDE detects the fault, limits the fuel injection rate and 
switches to pressure regulation. As of a fuel temperature of 60 °C (140 °F), the DDE reduces the fuel 
injection rate and the rail pressure to protect the rail-pressure regulating valve against overheating. In 
the event of a short circuit to positive, the engine shuts down. 


68 



N57TU Engine

6.1.3. Rail pressure sensor 



Rail pressure sensor 

A diaphragm with strain resistors is integrated in a metal housing. The measuring range of the 
sensor is dependent on the thickness of the diaphragm. The thicker the diaphragm, the higher the 
measurable pressure. The rail pressure sensor detects the current pressure in the rail. The pressure 
in the rail is of crucial importance to fuel injection. This measurement must be performed with great 
precision and within a suitably short period of time. If the rail pressure sensor fails, a fault is stored in 
the Digital Diesel Electronics and pressure regulation is activated "blind" by means of default values. 

For more information regarding the rail pressure sensor see the “Sensor section” of this training 
manual or refer to the repair instructions in ISTA. 


6.2. Leakage oil line 

The leakage oil line and return connector of the N57TU engine are new. The return connector must be 
in the open position in order to be able to connect the leakage oil line to the injectors. The connector 
is then plugged into the injector return and the latch mechanism is pushed in. The return connector is 
thus secured to prevent it from being pushed out. The return connector must be opened (see graphic) 
in order to open the connection.

6.3. Injector 

As with the N47TU the new solenoid injectors (common rail injector CRI2.5) are installed on the 
N57TU. They are produced by Bosch and operated with up to 1800 bar fuel pressure. Along with the 
increased maximum pressure, the number of possible switching actuations over the service life was 
also increased by 50%. It has multiple injection capability and also allows the implementation of very 
short switching times. The new solenoid injector delivers improved HC and CO emissions with the 
same power and consumption data as the 1800 bar piezo injector. An additional advantage of the 
solenoid type injector is the low manufacturing costs compared to piezo injectors. 

The nozzle geometry has also been adapted to satisfy the more exacting requirements of exhaust 
emissions legislation.

6.3.1. Injector CRI2.5 

Design 

Important modifications were done on the solenoid valve injector when compared with the N57 engine 
(not available in the US). Instead of a ball shaped control valve a ring design is now used. The main 
concern is the permanent leakage of the pressure compensated valve. With the new shape, a larger 
valve lift is achieved with low opening cross-section.

The behavior of the CRI2.5 injector is determined decisively by the control valve (13). The new injector 
should enable higher valve dynamics and simultaneously higher pressures. With the conventional ball 
valve this was not possible, because a reduction of the valve seat diameter to increase the operating 
pressure resulted in lower valve opening cross-sections for the control of the nozzle needle. Therefore 
the valve lift must be enlarged (at the cost of dynamics) which is not favorable with regards to injection 
rate and multiple fuel injection. 

So that higher fuel injection pressure with simultaneously increased dynamics (multiple fuel injections) 
can be achieved, a pressure compensating valve was developed. Through this design the hydraulic 
forces within the seat diameter are captured by a fixed element. The advantage of this valve is an 
opening cross-section three times as large with the same valve lift. 

Very short switching times can therefore be implemented with a small valve lift and simultaneously 
multiple fuel injections in very short time intervals. These modifications were necessary, since up to 
three pre-injections are required for emissions and noise reduction. However with regard to exhaust 
re-treatment there are currently up to four post-injections being used.

6.3.2. Injection volume calibration 

Due to the tolerance during manufacture of the injectors, the actual injected fuel volume deviates only 
slightly from the calculated fuel volume. This deviation is determined after manufacturing each injector 
by measurements in several operating conditions. For each injector an adjustment value (code) is 
generated from these measurements. For vehicle assembly, the compensation value of each injector is 
stored in the control unit after the installation of the Digital Diesel Electronics.

6. Fuel Preparation 

The compensation values are assigned to the individual cylinders according to the installation of the 
injectors. The DDE corrects the calculated injection quantities slightly with these compensation values 
and so reduces the cylinder specific deviations of the injection volume.

The engine electrical system has been redesigned compared to the first generation. Some new 
sensors have been installed, but in general most are the same as the sensors used in the (M57D30T2) 
engine in terms of their function and operating principle. The components for the automatic engine 
start-stop function are specially identified in the table. The DDE7.41 assumes the function of 
activating and evaluating the sensors and actuators. 

Note: The two NOx sensors and the PM sensor are not shown in the following DDE wiring 
illustration (IPO) because they have their own control units which communicate with the DDE 
via Lo-CAN.

7.1. Preheating control unit 

The preheating control unit is now secured to the differentiated air intake system which has 
significantly improved its accessibility.

Explanation

Preheating control unit 


The glow system comprises the following components: 

• Glowplug control unit with connection to the digital diesel engine management. 

• Ceramic, rapid-start glowplugs. 

The N57TU engine is fitted with ceramic glowplugs. They are distinguished by higher temperatures, 
lower power consumption and rapid response times. 

The tip of this type of glowplug is made of a ceramic material that is able to produce a temperature of 
1,300 °C (predecessor: 1,000 °C). 

Ceramic glowplugs also offer long service life characteristics. However, they must be handled with care 
because the ceramic tip is very fragile. 

The rapid-start glowplugs are designed for a voltage of 5.3 to 7.8 volts. During the glowplug start- 
assist stage, there may even be a voltage equivalent to the on-board supply voltage for a short time. 

The diagnosable glowplug control unit communicates with the DDE control unit via the LIN bus. 

The glowplug control unit is also connected to Terminal 15/Terminal 30B and by an additional "high- 
power connection" to Terminal 30. 


80 










N57TU Engine 

7. Engine Electrical System 

The pre-heater control unit's mechanical and electrical layout enable it to be fitted close to the engine. 
This reduces the length of the leads from the glowplug control unit to the glowplugs. The required 
heating output is determined by the DDE on the basis of specific operating conditions such as engine 
temperature, speed and load, and signalled to the glowplug control unit via the LIN bus. The glowplug 
control unit implements the request and sends back diagnostic and status information to the DDE 
control unit on request. 

The glowplug control unit receives the glowplug heating instructions for the various glowplug heating 
functions, e.g. start heating, heating while the engine is running or diagnostic heating, from the DDE 
control unit. 

A 

Glow plug identification must be performed when the preheating control unit or glow plugs 
are replaced. 


7.1.1. Glow plug 

The service function offers two functions which are required for repairs to the preheating system: 

• Before replacing glow plugs: activate the safety data record. 

Before replacing glow plugs, it is necessary to activate the safety data record with the service 
function. This is necessary to ensure that, in the event of a terminal change, the preheating 
control unit in the interest of safety activates the new glow plugs with the safety data record. 

• Once the glow plugs or preheating control unit have been replaced: perform glow element 
identification procedure. 

After replacing glow plugs or the preheating control unit, it is necessary to perform glow plug 
identification with the service function. 

The service function ensures that the correct data record for the installed glow plugs is 
activated in the preheating control unit. An incorrect data record may possibly remain active 
if glow plug identification is not performed. This may result if functional restrictions during 
glowing or damage to the glow plugs. 

The following are checked: 

Does the preheating control unit identify all the glow plugs? 

Are the correct glow plugs installed? 

Is the correct data record activated in the preheating control unit? 


Reason 

Different glow plug types are used in the N47TU and N57TU engines, depending on the power variant. 
The following tables shows which individual glow plug types are used in which engine:

There are different data records for the preheating control unit to enable the different glow plug types 
to be activated with the correct voltage profile in each case. As well as the data records for correct 
operation of the glow plugs, the preheating control unit also contains the so-called safety data record. 
The safety data record is configured in such a way that, in the event of a fault or incorrect installation, 
all the glow plug types can be energized without the risk of damage. There are two methods for 
identifying the glow plug types in the preheating control unit: 

1 Identification is initiated automatically with each full heating cycle after a terminal change. But 
in this case, the preheating control unit can only distinguish between metallic and ceramic 
glow plugs. Identification is aborted if the preheating control unit detects an excessive voltage 
fluctuation or the signal for starter motor intervention becomes active. If an incorrect glow plug 
type is identified more than once, the preheating control unit activates the safety data record. 

If only one glow plug of the incorrect type is identified, the preheating control unit removes this 
glow plug from further preheating operations in the current driving cycle and does not activate the 
safety data record. 

2 A special test preheating can be initiated by way of the service function. Here the safety data 
record is always activated if all the glow plugs are not clearly identified. 


A 

Glow plug identification must be performed when the preheating control unit or glow plugs 
are replaced. 


7.2. Sensors and actuators 


7.2.1. Crankshaft sensor 

The crankshaft sensor informs the DDE of the position of the crankshaft. The signal from the engine 
speed sensor is one of the most important variables in the engine management. 

The N57TU engine is equipped with a sensor that is able to detect reversed rotation. This is necessary 
for the automatic engine start-stop (MSA). The operation is identical to the conventional crankshaft 
sensor

Explanation

Active crankshaft sensor 

2 

Multipolar sensor wheel

Pole pair as “tooth gap” 


The sensor is what is known as an active speed sensor, also functioning in accordance with the Hall 
principle. The sensor has its own evaluation logic. 

With this speed sensor, pairs of magnetic poles assume the function of the teeth of an incremental 
gear. It can therefore be referred to as a multipolar sensor wheel, as already used in gasoline engines. 
On the multipolar sensor wheel, the tooth gap of the incremental gear is represented by a pair of poles 
twice as long. 

There are three Hall elements in the sensor, arranged next to each other in a housing. The signals of 
the first and third Hall element produce a differential signal for determining the signal frequency and 
the air gap to the sensor wheel. A clockwise or anti-clockwise direction of rotation can be detected 
thanks to the time offset between the signal of the center element and the differential signal. 

The additional signals of the air gap and the direction of rotation are output using the pulse width of 
the digital signal. 

The signals processed in the sensor are sent to the control unit on the combined ground and data line. 
On the data line, it is not the voltage level that is decisive but the current flow. There is a self-repeating 
data telegram that uses two different currents. 

The 14 mA level contains the information about the speed, direction of rotation and the air gap. The 7 
mA level acts as the evaluation current for the fault code memory. 


Unlike the sensors used to date (on non MSA vehicles), a pulse indicating sensor availability is sent 
approximately every 740 ms when the vehicle is stationary.

7.2.2. Camshaft sensor 



The N57TU camshaft sensor operates according to the Hall principle as with all BMW engines. 

The camshaft sensor is installed on the rear of the cylinder head cover above the intake camshaft. 

A camshaft sensor trigger wheel is mounted on the intake camshaft for this purpose. The Digital 
Diesel Electronics uses the camshaft sensor to detect whether the 1 st cylinder is in the compression 
phase or the gas exchange stroke. This assignment cannot be made from the crankshaft position. 
Assignment is necessary so that fuel injection can be regulated accordingly. The DDE supplies 
the sensor with 5 V and ground. The sensor supplies a digital signal via the signal line to the DDE. 

A special pattern allows emergency operation if the crankshaft sensor fails. The resolution of the 
camshaft sensor signal is, however, too inaccurate to replace the crankshaft sensor during normal 
operation.

The HFM 6 hot-film air mass meter is located downstream of the intake silencer and is fitted directly to 
its cover. The HFM measures the air mass taken in by the engine. This is used to record the actual air 
mass, which in turn is used to calculate the exhaust gas recirculation rate and the fuel limit volume. 

There is also an intake air temperature sensor in the HFM. The temperature evaluated by the HFM and 
sent to the DDE as a PWM signal. A pulse width of 22% equates to a temperature of -20 °C (-4 °F) 
and a pulse width of 63% equates to a temperature of 80 °C (176 °F). 

See the N47TU training material for more information. 

7.2.4. Rail pressure sensor 



Rail pressure sensor 


The rail pressure sensor consists of strain resistors which are incorporated on a diaphragm (6). One 
side of this diaphragm is in contact with the fuel high pressure (5), with the fuel pressure acting on 
the diaphragm. The diaphragm is deflected depending on the extent of the pressure. The resistors 
on the diaphragm alter their resistance under the mechanical strain created. The bridge voltage is 
amplified, temperature influences compensated and the pressure characteristic line arise by a bridge 
circuit and electronics (3) for signal processing in the sensor. The output voltage for the Digital Diesel 
Electronics ranges between 0 and 3.3 V. As is the case with the temperature sensor, the Digital Diesel 
Electronics stores a characteristic curve which assigns a corresponding pressure to each voltage 
value. The accuracy is ±2% of the end value.

7.2.5. Boost-pressure sensor 



Boost pressure sensor 


The boost-pressure sensor is located on the intake manifold and measures the pressure (absolute) 
inside it. It is supplied with 5 Volts and connected to ground by the DDE. 


87 





































N57TU Engine 

7. Engine Electrical System 

The boost pressure information is sent to the DDE on a signal line. The useful signal for the boost 
pressure fluctuates depending on the pressure. 

The measuring range of approximately 0.1 - 0.9 V corresponds to a boost pressure of 50 kPa (0.5 bar) 
to 300 kPa (3 bar). The sensor serves the purpose of controlling the boost pressure. 

7.2.6. Charge-air temperature sensor 

The charge-air temperature sensor is located in the air duct downstream of the charge-air cooler, 
directly upstream of the throttle valve. 



Charge-air temperature sensor 


The DDE connects the charge-air temperature sensor to ground and to a voltage divider circuit (in the 
DDE). 

The intake temperature sensor contains a temperature-dependent resistor that protrudes into the flow 
of intake air and assumes the temperature of the intake air. 

The resistor has a negative temperature coefficient (NTC). This means that the resistance decreases 
as temperature increases. 

The resistor is part of a voltage divider circuit that receives 5 Volts from the DDE. The electrical voltage 
at the resistor is dependent on the air temperature. There is a table stored in the DDE that specifies 
the corresponding temperature for each voltage value. The table is therefore a solution to compensate 
for the non-linear relationship between voltage and temperature. 

The resistance changes in relation to temperature from 149 kQ to 161 Q, corresponding to a 
temperature of -40 °C to 130 °C (-40 °F to 266 °F). 

Note: These specifications may vary. Please refer to the appropriate repair information for the 
most up to date repair instructions. 

7.2.7. Coolant temperature sensor 

The coolant temperature sensor is located on the front of the cylinder head. It records the temperature 
of the coolant at the engine outlet. This value is used for the engine temperature. It is connected to 
ground by the DDE. The second connection is connected to a voltage divider circuit in the DDE. 

The functional principle of the coolant temperature sensor is identical to that of the intake temperature 
sensor. The resistor has a negative temperature coefficient (NTC). This means that the resistance 
decreases as temperature increases.

the corresponding temperature for each voltage value. The table is therefore a solution to compensate 
for the non-linear relationship between voltage and temperature. 

The resistance changes in relation to temperature from 216 kQ to 41.7 Q, corresponding to a 
temperature of -55 °C to 150 °C (-58 °F to 302 0 F). 

Note: These specifications may vary. Please refer to the appropriate repair information for the 
most up to date repair instructions. 

7.2.8. Oxygen sensor 

The oxygen sensor is an indispensable component for controlling and measuring the composition 
of exhaust gas with the aim of conforming to legally stipulated emission values. This is achieved by 
measuring the residual oxygen content in the exhaust gas. 

For optimum combustion, a diesel engine is operated with a fuel-air ratio of A > 1, i.e. rich in oxygen. A = 
1 signifies a mixture of 1 kg fuel with 14.7 kg air. 

The oxygen sensor is located at the inlet to the shared housing of the diesel particulate filter (DPF) and 
NOx storage catalytic converter. 

The control sensor with rising characteristic is a type LSU 4.9 broadband oxygen sensor supplied by 
Bosch. This broadband oxygen sensor is installed upstream of the NOx storage catalytic converter 
close to the engine. 

The oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas can be determined over a large range with the broadband 
oxygen sensor. The broadband oxygen sensor is capable of providing accurate measurements not 
only at A = 1 but also at A < 1 (rich) and A > 1 (lean). The broadband oxygen sensor supplies a distinct, 
steady-state electrical signal from A = 0.7 to A — oo (X 00 = air). 

The DDE corrects the mixture composition through fuel injection based (in part) on the feedback of the 
O 2 sensor and the air mass (HFM). For optimum combustion, a diesel engine is operated with a fuel-air 
ratio of Lambda > 1, i.e. rich in oxygen. Lambda = 1 signifies a mixture of 1 kg fuel with 14.7 kg air. 

The DDE also compares this information to data points in a characteristic map that refers to the mean 
quantity value adaptation (MMA). The mean quantity adaptation serves to adapt the exhaust-gas 
recirculation more precisely to tolerance in the fuel injection rates. 

The Lambda oxygen sensor measures the fuel-air ratio. In the event of deviations, the DDE adapts the 
exhaust-gas recirculation rate to suit the change in air/fuel ratio. The mean quantity adaptation is not 
a rapid control operation, but is instead an adaptive learning procedure. An oxygen sensor deviation is 
“learned” in a characteristic map and stored for a sustained period in the DDE control unit. 

The exhaust after-treatment system also incorporates a second 0 2 sensor located downstream of 
the diesel particulate filter. It is also an LSU 4.9 broadband oxygen type sensor. This second oxygen 
sensor enables the system to monitor and detect whether the NOx storage catalytic converter needs 
to be regenerated. 

Note: The new system uses the two oxygen sensors and the two NOx sensors of the SCR 
system to monitor the entire exhaust after-treatment system for plausibility and fault 
detection.

For more information regarding the exhaust after-treatment refer to the “Second generation 
diesel engine emission controls” in the ST1210 Diesel Technology training material available 
on TIS and ICP. 


7.2.9. NOx sensors 

As with the M57D30T2 engine, the N57TU also uses Selective Catalyst Reduction system (SCR) for 
reducing NOx emissions. 

As with the previous SCR system SCR 2 also incorporates two NOx sensor (one upstream and one 
downstream of the SCR Catalyst). 

The nitrogen oxide sensor consists of the actual measuring probe and its own corresponding control 
unit. The control unit communicates via the Lo-CAN with the engine control unit. 

In terms of its operating principle, the nitrogen oxide sensor can be compared with a broadband 
oxygen sensor. The measuring principle is based on the idea of basing the nitrogen oxide 
measurement on oxygen measurement. 

Functional description 

The sensor system of the nitrogen oxide sensor consists of a solid electrolyte made of ceramic based 
on zirconium dioxide. Above a temperature of approximately 300°C, this material becomes conductive 
for oxygen ions. The installed heating element provides for the necessary operating temperature. 

The mixture of O 2 and nitrogen oxide in the exhaust gas reaches the nitrogen oxide sensor after the 
nitrogen oxide catalyst storage. The nitrogen oxide sensor consists of two chambers. A pump cell 
regulates the oxygen concentration to a specific value by pumping oxygen out of or into the first 
chamber. Through the application of a voltage, the oxygen molecules are split into ions and diverted 
through the solid electrolyte. The remaining nitrogen oxide then goes on to the second chamber. The 
oxygen concentration is then further reduced with a second pump cell in the second chamber. The 
remaining nitrogen oxide is split into oxygen and nitrogen at a catalytic element at the third pump cell. 
The released oxygen leads to a pump current which is proportional to the concentration of nitrogen 
oxide in the exhaust gas. The evaluation electronics generate the output signals based on the physical 
measured values. The control unit communicates via the Lo-CAN with the engine control unit. 

7.2.10. Particulate matter sensor 

Diesel particulate filter is an essential component of the exhaust after-treatment system for all current 
BMW diesel engines. Monitoring and diagnosis of the DPF (as with all emission systems) is required 
in order to insure its efficiency. This was done (in the previous system) via a differential pressure 
measurement which determines the pressure drop in the DPR As the regulatory mandates regarding 
the OBD diagnosis of the DPF are constantly being updated the pressure method is not sufficient to 
meet the tighter regulations. 

The particulate matter sensor was installed for the first time in combination with the second 
generation BMW diesel engines (N47TU and N57TU) which were introduced to the US market as 
of 7/2013. This sensor is in compliance with much more stringent US emission OBD diagnosis 
regulations and is a further enhancement to BMW Efficient Dynamics strategy. 


90 




N57TU Engine 

7. Engine Electrical System 



Particulate matter sensor 

The particulate matter sensor is integrated into the exhaust system downstream of the DPF and 
enables a constant diagnosis of the particulate filter (DPF). 

In vehicles with the N47TU and N57TU the PM sensor is located after the SCR. Due to its location, the 
sensor needs to stand up to many exhaust hazards including ammonia and urea from the SCR system. 
This location also affects the sensor’s ability to reach its necessary dew point. During this time the 
sensor sits idle and cannot be used to detect particulates. 

The PM sensor is very similar to a NOx sensor with regard to the construction of the body and that it 
also uses its own control unit. It has a 24 mm spin nut and an upper assembly to protect the wiring. 

Its internal sensing element is installed in the sensing tube and protected by a outer heat shield tube 
which helps to guide exhaust gas flow to the sensing element. 

The evaluation electronics generate the output signals based on the physical measured values. The 
control unit communicates via the Lo-CAN with the engine control unit. 

PM sensor operation 

The sensor function is based on resistance measurements. Soot particles in the exhaust gas are 
absorbed into the sensor and collect on the sensing element. These soot particles are electrically 
conductive and form a conductive path between the electrodes of the sensing element through which 
an electric current is flowing. This decreases the resistance across the electrodes and increases 
the current flow. The increase in current flow is measured against a baseline threshold current. The 
amount of time that the current takes to reach this threshold current is then compared. The PM sensor 
control unit forwards this measured current feedback via the Lo-CAN to the DDE. The DDE then 
compares the amount of time that the signal takes to reach the specified threshold current, and based 
on this, evaluates the efficiency of the DPF. 

Therefore if the current signal reaches the pre-set threshold before the predetermined time the DPF 
has failed. 


91 


N57TU Engine 

7. Engine Electrical System 

The sensing element is regenerated regularly by heating to burn off the (conductive) soot accumulated 
on the sensor element. This is done via an integrated heater to restore the initial resistance across the 
electrodes in order to “zero” the baseline and prepare the sensor to test another soot sample. 

A 

For more information refer to the “Second generation diesel engine emission controls” in the 
ST1210 Diesel Technology training material available on TIS and ICP. 


7.2.11. Exhaust gas temperature sensor 

The exhaust gas after-treatment system of the N47TU and N57TU engines uses three exhaust 
temperature sensors (besides the EGR temperature sensor). One located directly next to the oxygen 
sensor at the inlet to the NSC/DPF, a second is bolted to the NSC/DPF housing (down stream of the 
NSC just before the DPF). The third is located just before the SCR near the dosing valve. The first two 
exhaust temperature sensors are used by the DDE to monitor the efficiency of the NSC and to regulate 
regeneration of the DPF. The third sensor is used to send exhaust temperature feed back to the DDE 
with regard to the SCR system. 

All three exhaust temperature sensors are of the same type and operate as on previous engines. 

They contain a temperature-sensitive resistor with a negative temperature coefficient (NTC). This 
means that the resistance decreases as temperature increases. The resistor is part of a voltage divider 
circuit that receives 5 Volts from the DDE. The electrical voltage at the resistor is dependent on the air 
temperature. There is a table stored in the DDE that specifies the corresponding temperature for each 
voltage value. The table is therefore a solution to compensate for the non-linear relationship between 
voltage and temperature. 

The resistance changes in relation to temperature from 96 kQ to 32 Q, corresponding to a temperature 
of -40 °C to 800 °C (-40 °F to 1472 °F). 

A_ 

These specifications may vary. Please refer to the appropriate repair information for the most 
up to date repair instructions. 


7.2.12. Fuel temperature and pressure sensor 

Fuel temperature and pressure are monitored by a combination sensor that is located in the fuel 
supply directly upstream of the high-pressure pump. The combination sensor has four connections: 
The ground connection is shared by the individual sensors. The fuel-pressure sensor has a power 
supply and each sensor has one signal output. 

Fuel temperature sensor 

The fuel temperature sensor measures the fuel temperature upstream of the high-pressure pump. It 
is used for engine overheating protection and calculating the injection volume. The fuel temperature 
sensor is connected to ground and to a voltage divider circuit in the DDE. It contains a temperature- 
dependent resistor that protrudes into the fuel and assumes its temperature. The resistor has a 
negative temperature coefficient (NTC). This means that the resistance decreases as temperature 
increases. The resistor is part of a voltage divider circuit that receives 5 Volts from the DDE. The 
electrical voltage at the resistor is dependent on the fuel temperature. There is a table stored in

the DDE that specifies the corresponding temperature for each voltage value; the table is therefore 
a solution to compensate for the non-linear relationship between voltage and temperature. The

of -40 °C to 120 °C (-40 0 F to 248 0 F).

high-pressure pump. The fuel pressure is used by the DDE as a basis for the on-demand control of the 
electric fuel pump. The DDE connects the fuel pressure sensor to ground and supplies with a voltage 
of 5 V. It delivers a voltage signal to the DDE. A sheet diaphragm converts the fuel pressure into a path 
dimension. This path is converted into a voltage signal by four pressure-sensitive resistors. 

7.2.13. Exhaust back-pressure sensor upstream of exhaust turbocharger 

The exhaust back-pressure sensor upstream of the exhaust turbocharger is new. The new exhaust 
back-pressure sensor is manufactured by Denso. 

The exhaust back-pressure sensor measures the pressure in the exhaust emission system, upstream 
of the exhaust turbocharger. This information is required for optimum control of the exhaust-gas 
recirculation rate. The Digital Diesel Electronics (DDE) can control the exhaust-gas recirculation rate 
more precisely and efficiently via the exhaust back-pressure sensor and exhaust-gas temperature 
sensor. 

The exhaust back-pressure sensor is connected to the exhaust manifold via a pipe and a hose. The 
reason for the distance from the exhaust manifold is that the temperature of exhaust emission system 
can be very high and dirt contamination may accumulate on the sensor element. The connection to 
the hose must point downwards. The exhaust back-pressure sensor is connected to the Digital Diesel 
Electronics (DDE) via three pins. The DDE provides the ground and a voltage of 5 volts. The voltage 
signal arrives at the DDE via the third pin.

7.2.14. Throttle valve actuator 

The throttle valve actuator is mounted on the intake manifold. 

The DDE control unit calculates the position of the throttle valve from the position of the accelerator 
pedal and from the torque requirement of other control units. The throttle valve actuator is opened and 
closed electrically by the DDE control unit. 

It is controlled by the DDE by means of a PWM signal with a pulse duty factor of 5 to 95%. 

The throttle valve is also used for diesel particulate filter regeneration and to counteract shaking during 
engine switch-off.

Throttle valve actuator 


Position sensor 

To achieve optimum control of the throttle valve, its exact position must be constantly recorded. 

The throttle valve position is monitored contactlessly in the throttle valve actuator by 2 Hall sensors. 
The position sensor is supplied with 5 Volts and connected to ground by the DDE. Two data lines 
guarantee redundant feedback of the throttle valve position to the DDE. The second signal is output as 
the inverse of the first. The DDE evaluates the plausibility of the signal through subtraction. 

Actuator motor 

The actuator motor for operating the throttle valve is designed as a DC motor. It is driven by the DDE 
on demand. An H-bridge is used for activation which makes it possible to drive the motor in the 
opposite direction. The H-bridge in the DDE is monitored by the diagnostics system. When no power 
is applied to the drive unit, the throttle valve is set, spring-loaded, to an emergency operation position

8. Engine Control Functions 

8.1. Air supply 

In the diesel engine, the DDE requires information about the air mass taken in so that it can control 
various functions. The mass flow rate of the intake air is measured by the hot-film air mass flow sensor 
(HFM). 

The measured air mass flow rate is the basis for calculating the exhaust recirculation rate. 

The air mass is also used in the calculation of the limit volume. The limit volume is the maximum 
permissible volume of fuel that may be injected under full load before smoke development would 
occur. 

Swirl flaps provide a better air swirl effect. The result is to improve exhaust emission values. 

The electrically controlled swirl flaps are located in the tangential ducts of the intake manifold 
(integrated in the gasket between the differentiated air intake system and the cylinder head). They are 
closed or opened depending on the operating condition. The electrically controllable swirl flaps are 
opened by the swirl flap actuator with increasing engine speed. 

The swirl flaps are closed under the following conditions: 

• at low engine speeds and 

• low injection volumes (data-map controlled). 

The swirl flaps generally remain open if: 

• The coolant temperature is < 15 °C 

• The intake air temperature is < 15 °C 

The swirl flap actuator is a stepper motor that is controlled by the DDE control unit by means of a 
PWM signal. The stepper motor operates the connection lever and the swirl flaps close. An integrated 
sensor signals the position of the swirl flaps to the DDE control unit. 

8.1.1. Boost-pressure control 

The N57TU engine is boosted by an exhaust turbocharger. Adjustable guide vanes are pivoted on the 
outside around the turbine wheel on the exhaust side. The driving power which the exhaust gas exerts 
on the turbine is influenced by these guide vanes and thereby the desired boost pressure is set. 

A boost pressure actuator on the turbine housing actuates the adjustable guide vanes via a control 
rod. 

The Digital Diesel Electronics sends a pulse-width-modulated signal to the boost pressure actuator. 
The operating range of the signal is between 10% and 95%, where 10% means “guide vanes open” 
and 95% “guide vanes closed”. The electronics in the boost pressure actuator converts the pulse- 
width modulated signal into a setting angle and activates the servomotor. 

A feedback of the set position is detected via the integrated travel feedback in the boost pressure 
actuator by the DDE. The boost pressure actuator itself is capable of self diagnosis and signals an 
existing fault to the DDE.

8.2. Fuel supply 

8.2.1. Fuel injection 

The N57TU engine is equipped with high-pressure fuel injection with common rail pressure 
accumulator. 

The common rail has the following advantages: 

• Optimum fuel preparation for each individual cylinder. 

• Adaptation of injection time to engine operating conditions (engine speed, load, temperature). 

• Cylinder-selective injection correction in response to load change (the injection time can be 
corrected by post-injection, extending or shortening the time during the induction stroke). 

• Cylinder-selective switch-off possible. 

• Diagnostics of each individual injector is possible 

Common rail injection offers these advantages due to the fact that all cylinders are supplied with fuel 
independently of each other. 

8.2.2. High-pressure control 

The fuel quantity (flow) control valve establishes the fuel supply from the low pressure side to the high 
pressure side of the high-pressure pump, thus achieving the required rail pressure. The fuel quantity 
control valve is forced open hydraulically as from a defined pressure on the high pressure side of the 
high-pressure pump. The less fuel that the fuel quantity control valve allows into the high-pressure 
side, the less the radial cylinder/cylinders of the high-pressure pump will be filled. This results in a 
reduction in rail pressure. The signal from the rail pressure sensor is an important input signal for 
the DDE for the control of the volume control valve. During a cold start, the pressure in the rail is not 
controlled by the fuel quantity control valve but by the rail-pressure regulating valve in the rail. 

The high-pressure pump therefore always generates maximum pressure, which causes the fuel to heat 
up. The rail-pressure regulating valve also relieves excess pressure in the rail if the accelerator pedal is 
suddenly released. 

In the event of the rail pressure sensor failing, the DDE controls the volume control valve in emergency 
mode. 

See “Volumetric flow regulation functional description” and the “Fuel quantity control” 
section of this training manual for more information. 

8.2.3. Injector volume calibration 

At the end of the injector manufacturing process, measuring data is recorded for each individual 
injector. This is how the tolerance ranges of their hydraulic properties are determined. 

A correction value is then defined for the pre-injection and main injection. This correction value is 
printed on the injector as a seven-digit numerical code. In the event of an injector replacement, this 
correction value must be programmed into the DDE using the diagnostic system. 


97 



N57TU Engine 

8. Engine Control Functions 

8.2.4. Volume calibration control 

The DDE control unit detects fluctuations in engine speed. The control duration of the injectors is 
corrected based on these engine speed fluctuations. The volume calibration control equalizes the 
injection volume of all cylinders. 

8.2.5. Zero volume calibration 

The zero-volume calibration is a continual learning process. This learning process is required to enable 
precise pre-injection for each individual injector. Compliance with exhaust emission requirements 
demands precise metering of the very low pre-injection volume. Due to the injector volume drift, zero 
volume calibration has to be carried out constantly. 

A small amount of fuel is injected into each cylinder when the engine is overrunning. That quantity is 
gradually increased until the DDE control unit detects a slight increase in engine speed. That change 
enables the DDE control unit to detect when each cylinder starts to work. The volume of fuel injected 
during the zero-volume calibration sequence is used by the DDE control unit as the base figure for the 
pre-injection data map. 

8.2.6. Mean volume adaptation 

Mean volume adaptation is a learning process whereby the fuel/air ratio (lambda value) is corrected by 
adjusting the air mass flow rate or exhaust recirculation rate. Unlike the other processes, this process 
affects all injectors equally rather than the individual injector. 

An injection volume averaged across all cylinders is calculated from the lambda value measured by the 
oxygen sensor and the air mass flow rate measured by the hot-film air mass flow sensor. That figure is 
compared with the injection volume specified by the DDE control unit. 

If a discrepancy is identified, the air mass flow rate is adjusted to match the actual injection volume by 
adjusting the EGR valve. The correct lambda value is set in turn. 

The mean volume adaptation is not an "instantaneous" regulation but an adaptive learning process. 

In other words, the injection volume error is taught into an adaptive characteristic map that is 
permanently stored in the EEPROM of the control unit. 

A replacement of the following components requires a reset (delete) of this characteristic map: 

• HFM 

• Injector(s) 

• Rail-pressure sensor 

The characteristic map is reset by a function in the BMW diagnostic system. 

Mean volume adaptation has to be reset if one of the following components has been replaced: 

• Air-mass sensor 

• Fuel-rail pressure sensor 

• Oxygen sensor (upstream of the NSC)

8.3. Exhaust emission system 

8.3.1. Oxygen control 

An optimum fuel-air mixture is necessary for complete and problem-free combustion. 

Modern catalytic converters therefore achieve a conversion rate of 98% up to virtually 100%, i.e. the 
percentage of converted pollutants. The optimum composition of the fuel-air mixture is controlled by 
the DDE. The required information relating to the composition of the exhaust gas is supplied by the 
oxygen sensors. 

The broadband oxygen sensor upstream of the catalytic converter constantly measures the residual 
oxygen in the exhaust gas. The fluctuating residual oxygen levels are passed to the DDE control unit as 
voltage signals. 

The DDE control unit uses them as the basis for adjusting the mixture composition. 

Second generation diesel engines (N47TU and N57TU) use a Nox storage catalyst in place of (the 
previously used) oxidation catalyst. Both oxidation and reduction processes occur in the NSC catalytic 
converter. Oxygen (O 2 ) is required for oxidation while carbon monoxide CO is required for reduction. 
The pollutants CO, HC, NOx and the reduction catalysts O 2 and CO must be present in a certain ratio 
in order to facilitate the highest possible conversion rate. 

The system uses a second oxygen sensor located downstream of the diesel particulate filter. This 
second oxygen sensor enables the system to detect whether the NOx storage catalytic converter 
needs to be regenerated. 

A_ 

For more information regarding the NOx storage catalytic converter refer to the “Second 
generation diesel engine emission controls” in the ST1210 Diesel Technology training 
material available on TIS and ICP. 


8.3.2. Lambda adaptation 

Lambda adaptation (mixture adaptation) serves the purpose of adjusting component tolerances and 
ageing phenomena that have an influence on the fuel-air mixture. Factors such as secondary air and 
fuel pressure also affect lambda adaptation (partial adjustment). For these reasons, no exact control 
limits can be specified for a specific fault. The following distinctions are made in terms of lambda 
adaptation: 

• Additive mixture adaptation 

• Multiplicative mixture adaptation 

Additive mixture adaptation is effective at idle speed or near the idle speed range. Its influence 
decreases as the engine speed increases. Multiplicative mixture adaptation is effective over the entire 
characteristic map. One of the main factors is the fuel pressure. 


99 




N57TU Engine

The service function "Reset adaptation data" can be used to reset the adaptation data and the 
equipment options back to their factory settings. It will then be necessary to relearn the adaptation 
values. A longer period of vehicle operation between idle speed and partial load is required in order to 
learn the values for mixture adaptation. 

8.3.3. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) 

As with previous BMW diesels the N57TU also uses an Exhaust Gas Recirculation System. 



EGR valve 


A calculated volume of exhaust gas based on the prevailing operating condition is fed back to the 
intake manifold by the EGR valve to reduce emissions. 

Under certain engine operating conditions, a certain amount of exhaust is fed back into the intake 
manifold by the EGR valve for the purposes of reducing exhaust emissions. 

The volume of the recirculated exhaust gas influences the mass of the intake fresh air: The more 
exhaust gas is recirculated, the less fresh air is taken in. It is known how much fresh air mass the 
engine takes in at any given operating point with EGR switched off. The reduction in the intake fresh air 
mass caused by the exhaust gas recirculation is therefore a measure of the volume of the recirculated 
exhaust gas. The system is controlled in such a way that the specified air mass flow rate for the 
operating situation is drawn in. 

The DDE control unit calculates a target fresh air mass for each operating point from the following 
influencing variables: 


100 


Engine speed 
Injected quantity 
Coolant temperature 


N57TU Engine 

8. Engine Control Functions 

• Atmospheric pressure 

• Intake air temperature 

• Reduction in the exhaust gas recirculation caused by idling for longer than 5 minutes. 

The DDE control unit can not precisely determine the mass flow rate of the recirculated exhaust 
because the hot-film air mass-flow sensor only measures the flow rate of the intake air and has a wide 
tolerance band for system design reasons. 

The exhaust recirculation rate is controlled by operating the EGR valve but without an exhaust 
recirculation sensor and relatively imprecisely. The oxygen sensor (up stream of the NSC) detects 
whether too much or too little exhaust is being recirculated. The exhaust recirculation rate is then 
readjusted according to the information from the oxygen sensor. 

The EGR temperature sensor and the exhaust back-pressure sensor upstream of the turbocharger 
in conjunction with the boost pressure sensor make it possible to precisely control the exhaust 
recirculation rate. Thus substantially improved control of the quantity of recirculated exhaust and, 
therefore, of the NOx content of the exhaust is possible. 

Function 

The exhaust-gas recirculation actuator is opened or closed electrically by the DDE control unit. To 
ensure optimized control of the exhaust-gas recirculation rate, the exact position must be continuously 
detected. The position of the exhaust-gas recirculation actuator is monitored by a non-contact hall 
effect sensor. 

The mean quantity adaptation (MMA) serves to adapt the exhaust-gas recirculation more precisely 
to fine tune the fuel injection rates. The air ratio measured by the oxygen sensor and the air mass 
measured by the hot-film air-mass meter are used to determine a mean fuel injection rate across all 
cylinders. This value is compared with the fuel injection rate specified by the DDE control unit. If there 
is a deviation, the air mass is adapted to the actual fuel injection rate by adjusting the exhaust-gas 
recirculation actuator in such a way that the correct air ratio is set. 

The mean quantity adaptation is not a rapid control operation, rather an adaptive learning procedure. 
That means that the fuel injection rate error is learned in an adaptive characteristic map that is stored 
permanently in the DDE control unit. 

The servomotor for the exhaust-gas recirculation actuator is a direct current motor. The position 
sensor is a hall effect sensor. The hall effect sensor determines the revolutions of the servomotor. This 
is used to calculate the position of the exhaust-gas recirculation actuator.
