E83 Chassis Dynamics 




Purpose of the System 


E83 Chassis Dynamics 

As with all BMW vehicles, the X3 chassis and suspension was designed with particular 
emphasis on driving pleasure, dynamics and favorable handling. 

The main aim in the full development of the X3 was to achieve: 

• Agility on the road 

• Driving dynamics 

• Stability 

• Traction 

The front axle is a double joint spring strut axle with tension arms and a rack and pinion 
steering system with hydraulic power assist. Conventional rack and pinion power steer¬ 
ing is installed to the E83 as standard. Servotronic is available as an option. Spring 
struts with coil springs and twin tube gas-pressure dampers are used on the front axle. 

It is similar the front axle of the E53. 

The rear axle design is based on the E46/16 with barrel springs and separate twin tube 
gas-pressure dampers. 

The brake system is a hydraulic dual-circuit brake system with "front/rear split" vacuum 
boost power assist and EBV. The parking brake actuating unit is located in the center 
console and is eguipped with an automatic cable adjuster (ASZE) and a compensating 
element. 

Several different wheel and tire combinations are available for the E83. The spare wheel 
(steel) is located in a special bracket under the luggage compartment floor in the rear. 
The tire deflation warning (RDW) is a standard feature on the E83. 

System Components 

Front Axle 

Specific components in the E83 (subject to additional load) are designed as forged 
steel parts. 

• Control arms: forged steel with rubber mount 

• Tension arms: forged steel with hydraulic bushing 

• Swivel bearing: forged steel, track arm forged on

E83 Chassis Dynamics 


A reinforcement plate (thrust panel) is bolted to the front axle carrier. This makes a contri¬ 
bution to the rigidity of the front structure and suspension. There are two recesses in this 
thrust zone for accessibility to the engine oil drain plug (rectangular recess on 6 cylinder 
engines).

Workshop Hints 


Alignment and Camber Adjustment 

Toe-in adjustment is performed at the tie rods. If necessary, the camber is corrected by 
driving out the pin on the strut tower (spring cup). 

Strut Replacement 

When replacing the strut, the mounting on the swivel bearing must be expanded with a 
special tool. 

Spring Replacement 

There are new spring tensioners to be used during spring replacement. Refer to Repair 
Instructions for detailed information about special tools. 

Reinforcement Plate 

The vehicle must not be driven without the reinforcement plate in place. The reinforce¬ 
ment plate ensures the transversal rigidity and contributes to the strength of the front 
axle. 


Rear Axle 

The E83 is fitted with a central rear axle and subframe. The design of the rear axle is 
similar to the E46/16. Two tension arms have been added to the rear axle of the E83 
and are secured to the bodyshell.

Adjustment of Rear Wheel Alignment 

Rear wheel alignment is adjusted by a special tool on the lower trailing arm (refer to 
Repair Information for additional details. The camber is adjusted by an eccentric element 
on the lower control arm at the axle carrier connection. 


Lowering (removing) the Rear Axle 

The handbrake cables (routed through the rear axle carrier and the body console) must 
be disengaged before the rear axle is lowered. This is to prevent shearing of the hand¬ 
brake cables.

Brakes 


The brake system is a hydraulic dual-circuit brake system with "front/rear split", vacuum 
boost power assist and EBV. One brake circuit each for the front and rear axles. The 
parking brake actuating unit is located in the center console and is eguipped with an 
automatic cable adjuster (ASZE) and a compensating element. 

The advantages of the parking brake with automatic cable adjuster are: 

• The 2 cables no longer have to be adjusted during installation. 

• Cable extensions (cable conduit) contractions over the operating time are automati¬ 
cally compensated so that the parking brake lever travel is consistent. 

• Prestretching of the cables is no longer necessary. 

• The parking brake does not have to be adjusted at the end of the assembly line 
and in the service department. 

• Note: color coded handbrake cables (left/right different part numbers). 


Mechanical Components 

The brake system consists of the following components:

E83 Chassis Dynamics 









Four Wheel Hydraulic Disc Brakes 

The front brakes are constructed of ventilated brake discs 325mm diameter x 25mm 
thick (Geomet coating) with FN57/25 single piston floating calipers. 

The rear brake brakes are constructed of ventilated brake discs 320mm diameter x 
22mm thick (Geomet coating) with FN42/22 single piston floating calipers. 


Hydraulic Unit with Vacuum Brake Booster and DSC Hydraulic Module 

The hydraulic unit is located at the front on the left hand side under the main brake cylin¬ 
der. The electric precharging pump is no longer reguired. All vehicles are eguipped with 
an 879" tandem brake booster and have a tandem brake master cylinder. The DSC 
hydraulic module is a DSC8 system. 


Foot Controls with Brake and Clutch Pedals 

The essential components of the foot controls are: 

• Pedal mounting block 

• Brake pedal 

• Clutch pedal 

• Clutch master cylinder 

The pedal mounting block is made of aluminum and is bolted to the bulkhead. 
The vehicle has a wide steel brake pedal. The clutch pedal is made of plastic. 


Parking Handbrake Lever, ASZE, Cables and Duo-Servo Brakes. 

The duo-servo brakes are similar to the duo-servo brakes on the E65 and E53 
(185mm diameter x 30mm wide). 

The handbrake lever is bolted to the floor pan and is eguipped with an automatic cable 
adjuster (ASZE) and a compensating element. Refer to ST045 E85 or ST047 E60 
Technical Training handouts for additional details on deactivating and activating this unit. 

Workshop Hints 

Changing Cables 

If there is a broken cable, the automatic cable adjuster is in the untensioned position. To 
replace the cables, it is necessary to remove the center console and the rear compart¬ 
ment ventilation ducts. For the cables to be removed or parking break shoe replacement, 
the parking-brake lever must be in the released position and the ASZE unit must be 
deactivated. Refer to the Repair Instructions or ST045 E85, ST047 E60 Technical 
Training handouts for additional details.

Steering 

Conventional rack and pinion power steering is used in the E83 and Servotronic is avail¬ 
able as an option. The design and functioning principle of the Servotronic option are 
nothing new but have been modified as described in this chapter. 

The servotronic steering system controls the amount of power assistance based on the 
current road speed. The hydraulic pressure is electronically adapted to the current road 
speed, with greater power assistance available at lower road speeds and less power 
assistance available at greater road speeds. 


Mechanical/Hydraulic Components 


1. Power-steering cooler 

2. Hydraulic pump with supply reservoir 
(M57TU, diesel) 

3. Servotronic control unit 

4. Upper steering column assembly 

5. Flexible hoses 

6. Steering gear 

7. Hydraulic pump with separate supply 
reservoir (M54B25 and M54B30) 



The E83 is eguipped with hydraulic assisted rack and pinion steering. The total ratio 
of the steering is: 18.9 : 1. The total rack stroke is 81.0 mm (1.7 turns of the steering 
wheel). The hydraulic ports on the steering gear have guick release couplings. The 
hydraulic pump maximum pressure is limited to 127 bar. 

E83 vehicles are eguipped with “W” shaped cooling loops (hoses) to assist in cooling. 


CAUTION!!! 


The hydraulic pump does not have a pump end shutdown feature. The hydraulic pump 
could be damaged after approximately 1 minute if the steering is kept on full lock 
(end stop) for a long period.

Wheels and Tires 

Several different wheel stylings are available. Different 17" wheel stylings are standard 
equipment. Other 17" and 18" wheels are available as options, depending on the type 
of engine. 

A compact wheel (spare/emergency wheel) is standard, regardless of the vehicle version. 

The tire deflation warning (RDW) is a standard feature. The RDW function is integrated in 
the DSC control unit. 

The following wheel/tire combinations are available for US models: 


2.5Liter Engine (optional for 3.0 Liter) 

• 8.0Jx17 EH2 IS46* (shown to the right) 

• 235/55 R17 LI 99** tires 

• A/S 

• H-rated tires, M+S 



3.0 Liter Engine (optional for 2.5 Liter) 

• 8.0Jx17 EH2 IS46* (shown to the right) 

• 235/55 R17 LI 99** tires 

• A/S 

• H-rated tires, M+S

E83 Chassis Dynamics 






The spare/emergency wheel (compact wheel) is standard equipment. The E83 has a 
special bracket for the compact wheel which is located in the vehicle floor under the 
luggage compartment and is operated from inside the vehicle. 

The release knob is located under the luggage 
compartment floor covering next to the tool kit. 

The compact wheel is a 4Bx17 IS18 steel 
wheel with T135/90 R17 104 M tire. 

The compact wheel bracket has a special ser¬ 
vice access cap (1) to check the tire pressure 
without having to lower the bracket/wheel. 


Tire Deflation Warning (RDW) 

The RDW function is integrated (and diagnosed) in the DSC control unit. The system 
uses the rotation speed of the diagonally opposite wheels to compare the dynamic cir¬ 
cumferences of all four wheels. 

The RDW system does not monitor uniform air pressure loss over all 4 tires. If the pres¬ 
sure loss is the same in all four tires, the wheel speeds change equally and pressure loss 
cannot be detected. The customer must continue to check inflation pressures on a regu¬ 
lar basis. 

The system must be reinitialized if tire inflation pressures are modified or if the tires/ 
wheels are replaced. Initializing RDW: 

1 .Start the engine but do not drive away. 

2. Press and hold the RDW button in the center console until the indicator 
light in the instrument cluster illuminates in yellow for several seconds. 

3. Drive away. 

After a certain distance, the system stores the new wheel speeds as reference values and 
is then able to display a detected deviation. RDW has an indicator light in the instrument 
cluster that may illuminate in yellow or red. 

Indicator illuminates in red: 

• Indicates a loss of more than 30% of 
inflation pressure in one of the tires 

• Accompanied by a “gong” sound 
Indicator illuminates in yellow : 

• Possible faults in the system 

• Initialization
