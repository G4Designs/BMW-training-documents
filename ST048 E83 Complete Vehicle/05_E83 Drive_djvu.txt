Drive Modifications 

Please reference to ST045 E85 and ST046 E60 Training Handouts for additional details 
on the M54 engine and MS45.0/MS45.1 Engine Management systems. 

The following modifications have been made to the engine for use in the E83: 

• Modified Belt Drive - the position of the deflection pulley on the alternator (150 A 
Bosch/Valeo) has been modified slightly. 

• M54B25 manual and automatic transmission and M54B30 manual transmission 
equipped vehicles use Siemens MS45.0 engine management system. This system 
is LEV emission compliant. 

• M54B30 automatic transmission equipped vehicles use Siemens MS45.1 engine 
management system. This system is ULEVII emission compliant. 


Exhaust System 

The following exhaust sys¬ 
tem is used at the start of 
E83 series production: 


1. Front silencer 

2. Center silencer 

3. Rear silencer 

4. Diaphragm chamber to 
operate the exhaust flap

TM603-3 












The E83 exhaust system is made of stainless steel. The exhaust system connected to 
the M54 engine is one piece from the exhaust manifolds to the rear silencer (muffler). 
However, the system is available in sections for service replacement. 

As on current BMW M54 engines, each exhaust manifold is equipped with metal base 
catalytic converters, 2 pre-catalyst and 2 post catalyst oxygen sensors. 

The rear silencer is equipped with an exhaust flap (similar to the E46). It reduces noise in 
the lower engine rpm range. The exhaust flap is operated by a Diaphragm (4). It is con¬ 
trolled by a solenoid valve, which is controlled in turn by the ECM (DME). The rear 
silencer has an 18.5 liter volume. 


Cooling System 

This section describes the cooling module installed in the E83 in conjunction with the 
M54B25 and M54B30. The following components of the cooling module were adopted 
from the E46 and E85: 

• Module carrier • Transmission oil cooler (oil-water heat exchanger) 

• Fan • Expansion tank 


The following components were physically modified for use in the E83: 


Radiator - performance increased 
Fan shroud 


A/C condenser - performance increased 
PS cooler - performance increased

E83 Fuel System Modifications 

To comply with ever increasing emissions laws, the E83 fuel system has a further 
decrease in the number of openings and ports over previous series production. On the 
E83, the filler valves and service breather valves are completely encapsulated by the fuel 
tank. 

The only ports/openings except the fuel filler neck are located in the two service access 
cover plates. 

Components 

The fuel tank is located above the drive shaft in front of the rear axle (similar to E46) and 
is secured by two tensioning straps. The fuel tank capacity is 67 liters, including 8 liters 
of reserve fuel. It is made of plastic (multi-layer HDPE) with an intermediate layer (barrier 
layer). 

Access to the fuel filter, pressure regulator, the two fuel level sensors and the electric fuel 
pump are through the two service access covers. The fuel filler neck is secured to the 
right hand side of the fuel tank with hose clamps.

2. Filler pipe 

3. Vent line 

4. Right service access cover 


5. Left service access cover 

6. Evaporative purge line 

7. Fuel delivery line

Fuel Delivery 

The fuel is supplied to the engine from the fuel tank as follows: 

• From the right hand half of the fuel tank 

• Through the non-return valve inside the fuel baffle chamber (only for initial filling 
of the fuel baffle) 

• Into the fuel baffle chamber 

• Pumped out by the electric fuel pump (EKP) 

• Into the fuel filter 

• Through the line in the right hand service access cover to the engine 

• Pumped out by the electric fuel pump in parallel through a separate fuel line to the 
right hand suction-jet pump, then from the right hand half into the fuel baffle (level 
increase) 

Fuel Pressure Regulation 

With pressure regulation, fuel is fed through the fuel tank as follows: 

• Fuel pressure controlled by the pressure regulator (3.5 bar) 

• To the suction-jet pump in the left hand half of the fuel tank 

• Into the fuel baffle chamber 

At the same time, the suction-jet pumps draw the fuel from the right and left hand sides 
of the fuel tank. This ensures that the fuel baffle and the electric fuel pump are supplied 
with fuel at all times. 

Filler Venting 

To provide filler venting, there is a breather unit in the fuel tank consisting of a service 
breather valve (11) and filler breather valve (9). There is also a roll over valve (10) on the 
right hand service access cover. The filler breather valve allows air and fuel vapors to 
escape from the fuel tank when the vehicle is refuelled (venting). 

When the vehicle is refuelled, the air and fuel vapors vent via: 

• The filler breather valve 

• Through the vent line 

• To the roll over valve 

• Through the T-fitting on the fuel filler neck 

• Into the activated charcoal filter 


8 

E83 Drive 




When the maximum capacity is reached, the filler breather valve is closed by the fuel lift¬ 
ing the internal float valve. The fuel level rises in the fuel filler neck and trips the fuel 
pump nozzle. A vapor barrier (approximately 15 liters) remains in the tank above the filler 
breather valve after the tank has been filled. This provides internal liquid/vapor separation. 

Service Breather Valve 

The fuel vapors produced are vented: 

• Through the filler breather valve 

• Through the service breather valve if the filler breather valve is closed 

• To the roll over valve 

• Through the vent line 

• Through the T-fitting on the fuel filler neck 

• Into the activated charcoal filter (AKF) 

• Through the evaporative purge line 

• Through the evaporative purge valve (TEV) 

• To the engine intake manifold 


The service breather valve only opens if the filler breather valve is closed (fuel tank full to 
capacity). The service breather valve location is higher in the tank than the filler breather 
valve and opens at a pressure of 50 mbar. When the fuel tank is not full, vapors are vent¬ 
ed through the filler breather valve.

E83 Drive 





















Both style rear drive shafts are 
equipped with a deforming ele¬ 
ment. 

The front section of the drive 
shaft is designed as a collapsing 
tube (1). 

When the drive shaft is com¬ 
pressed (collapsed) it absorbs a 
defined force. 

After collision or accident repairs, 
the drive shafts must always be 
checked for compression of the 
collapsing tube (refer to Repair 
Instructions for additional details). 



Note: When the collapsing tube is deformed, the drive shaft must be replaced. 


Front Drive Shaft 

The front drive shaft connects the transfer case to the front axle drive. It is designed as a 
one piece section without a center bearing and has two universal joints. 

Rear Axle Final Drive 

The 188 K (ring gear size) final drive is known from the previous model series produc¬ 
tions. The final drive ratio varies depending on the engine/gearbox combination. For the 
US with M54 engines, the ratio is 3.64:1 for both automatic and standard transmissions. 

Front Axle Drive 

The vehicles are equipped with the familiar VAG 174 front axle drive, regardless of the 
engine and transmission variant. The front axle ratio is always identical to the final drive 
ratio (3.64:1 for US with M54 engines). 

* Lifetime oil fill on both axles 


Rear Output Shafts 

The rear output shafts have sliding joints for length compensation on both wheel side (1) 
and axle side (2). 


Note: There is a difference in shaft 
tube length of approximately 54 mm 
between the right and left output 
shaft. 



13 

E83 Drive 




















Front Output Shafts 

The locking angle of wheel side fixed joint (1) is 50°. The axle side joint (4) slides to 
compensate for differences in length caused by suspension/axle movements. 







1. Constant velocity joint (fixed joint), wheel side 

2. Front left output shaft 

3. Front right output shaft 

4. Triple roller joint (sliding joint), axle side
