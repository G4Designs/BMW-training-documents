Power Supply 
Battery 

Different vehicle batteries with different capacities are used depending on the engine and 
equipment specification. The battery is located in the luggage compartment in the 
spare-wheel recess. 

Battery Lead 

The E83 has different battery leads depending on the engine variant. The B+battery 
cable is routed through the interior of the X3, along the floor on the passenger side. The 
B+ cable is made of aluminum and has a diameter of 80mm 2 . 

Fuses 

The E83 is equipped with two fuse holders. The luggage compartment fuse holder with 
the fuse of the front fuse holder is located next to the vehicle battery in the spare wheel 
recess.

w/Top HiFi Fuse. 

The glovebox fuse holder carries the majority of the fuses. The main fuses for the DME 
and the ignition/starter switch are located on the rear side of the glovebox fuse holder. 

Bus Systems 

The Bus system of the E83 is based on the E46 with minor upgrades. 

The following Bus Systems are used on the E83: 

• K-Bus 

• PT-CAN 

• Diagnosis Bus 

• Sub-Bus Systems (BSD, LIN, M, Data Interface) 


5 

E83 Body Electrical 







K-Bus 

The K-bus links the components of the general vehicle electrical system, the information 
and communications systems and the safety system. The majority of the systems and 
components has been taken from other models and adapted to the E83. 

A new feature is the control system for the new panorama sunroof (MDS) and the safety 
system (MRS4RD). 

The satellite radio (SDARS) has been adapted to the connection to the K-bus. 

The data transfer rate is 9.6 kbit. 

PT-CAN 

The PT-CAN links the components of the control units for the drive and chassis systems. 
Newly incorporated is the VG-SG control unit for the transfer case. 

The data transfer rate is 500 kbit. 

Diagnosis Bus 

The diagnosis bus is connected with two leads to the overall bus system. The PIN 7 
diagnostic connector lead is directed to the DME and transfers all the emissions-related 
data from the engine management system and from the automatic gearbox. 

The PIN 8 diagnostic connector is connected to the remaining control units either directly 
or via the instrument cluster as gateway. 

The data transfer rate is 9.6 kbit. The rate of transfer of emissions related data 
KWP2000* (E-OBD and OBD) is 10.4 kbit. 

Sub-Bus Systems 

The following sub-buses are used in the E83: 

• BSD Bit-serial data interface - connection of electronic engine management and 
alternator 

• LIN Local Interconnected Network - connection of AHL and bi-xenon headlights, 
connection of GM5 and driver's or door mirror switch block 

• M-bus - connection of IHKA/IHKR and stepping motors 

Energy Management 

Energy management for the E83 is taken from the E46. The software for regulating the 
charging voltage is in the DME. In the event of an increased current consumption in the 
vehicle electrical system, the charging voltage specification can be increased. The charg¬ 
ing voltage specification is issued by the DME via the bit-serial data interface to the alter¬ 
nator.

The charging voltage can be regulated as a function of the outside temperature. Thus the 
battery can be charged to optimum effect. At low temperatures, the charging voltage can 
be increased to obtain a higher capacity. At high temperatures, the charging voltage is 
reduced to avoid excessive gassing. The maximum charging voltage is 14.8 V. 

A battery change does not have to be communicated to the DME control unit. 

Energy management also features the option of load/consumer shutdown. In the event of 
excessive current consumption in the vehicle, the power output of the heated rear win¬ 
dow can be reduced. 

Starter Control 

EWS III plus is used in the E83. The basic function of starter control and enabling of DME 
and EGS has remained the same. With EWS III plus the terminal 50 information is for¬ 
warded not from the starter motor but rather directly from the EWS control unit to the 
instrument cluster. A circuit is hardwired from the output of the starter relay in the EWS III 
plus control unit directly to the instrument cluster. In order to avoid erroneous measure¬ 
ments, no sensor values are stored during the starting process. 


General Vehicle Electrical 

Introduction 

The general vehicle electrical system of the E83 is for the most part based on the central 
body electronics 5 ZKE 5 of the E46. 

The functions of the general vehicle electrical system are comparable to those of the 
general vehicle electrical system on the E46: 

• Central locking 

• Power windows, different to the E46 

• Wipe/wash system 

• Anti-theft alarm system 

• Interior Lights 

• Consumer shutdown 

• Remote control operation

• Switch block, driver 

The stored positions of the door mirrors are lost if the GM5RD is replaced. 

GM5 Redesign 

The General Module 5 Redesign (GM5RD) is the heart of the general vehicle electrical 
system. The GM5RD, which was used on the E85, has been further developed for the 
E83 with a combined K-/LIN bus module. The K-/LIN bus module is integrated in the 
GM5RD for operation of the door mirrors. 

Power Windows 

The power windows of the E83 are controlled by the GM5RD similar to the operation in 
the E46. The anti-trapping feature has been modified and the anti-trap strip is not used 
in the E83. Anti-trapping is provided by the EKS electronics included in the individual 
window motors. 

The SBFA (drivers door switch block assembly) is connected to the GM5RD via the LIN 
Bus. The passenger door switch and both rear door switch assemblies are connected 
directly via hardwire to the GM5RD.

window is made of toughened safety glass (ESG) and is approximately 3.1 mm thick. 

The AM aerial is in the rear spoiler. To avoid disturbances in AM reception through the 
third brake light in the rear spoiler, there is a suppressor filter in the feed line to the third 
brake light. 

The power supply to the AM and FM aerial amplifier comes from the radio via terminal 
Rad_on.

Aerial Amplifier 

The aerial amplifier for AM, FM and (FBD) as well as the aerial diversity module are built 
into a housing. The module is fitted on the inside of the tailgate. 


FM Aerial Diversity 

The tuner is connected to the aerial diversity module via an aerial connector (Fakra) and a 
coaxial cable. The antenna diversity switches to the next aerial as soon as the signal 
quality of the active FM aerial exceeds a defined threshold value. No interruption can be 
heard when the diversity module switches over. Evaluation of the signal quality and the 
switch over only occur in the aerial diversity module.

Audio Systems 

The various audio systems of the E83 are described in this technical documentation. 

The radio systems originate from the E85. The loudspeaker systems are new develop¬ 
ments and are adapted to the acoustic and technical dimension requirements of the E83. 

The following audio systems are available for the E83: 

• HiFi audio system (Standard) 

• Top HiFi audio system 


The BMW audio standards which have been applied since the E85 are also being applied 
to the E83. They apply to the HiFi and Top HiFi systems with regard to symmetry of the 
sound field, sound pressure and linearity of the frequency response. 

New Features 

New features by comparison with the E85: 

• Central woofers for the HiFi and Top HiFi audio systems are fitted. The central bass 
principle applies to the systems in the E65/E60. 

• The HiFi amplifier in the E83 luggage compartment is a modified version of the HiFi 
amplifier from the E85/E46. A 6 channel amplifier is adapted from the 10 channel hifi 
amplifier via internal switch changes. 

• A fuse is added to the Carver Top HiFi amplifier from the E85 but is otherwise 
installed in the E83 without further modifications.

The HiFi audio system features a 6 channel analogue amplifier that is connected directly 
to the 4 speaker outputs of the radio. The loudspeakers are connected to the 6 HiFi 
amplifier out channels. The tweeters are protected from overload by capacitors in the 
supply lead and connected in parallel to the broadband speakers. 

All sound controlling functions such as volume, bass, treble, fader, and GAL are per¬ 
formed in the radio. 

HiFi Amplifier 

The 6 channel HiFi amplifier in the luggage 
compartment of the E83 is a modified version 
of the 10 channel HiFi amplifier from the 
E85/E46. Four channels are for the door loud¬ 
speakers (broad-band loudspeaker or broad¬ 
band speaker with additional tweeter) and 2 
channels are for the central woofers. 

The housing is constructed in the same way as 
the 10 channel HiFi amplifier in the E85/E46. 

The HiFi amplifier has on output of 4 x 25 watts 
for the mid-range and high-ranges and 2 x 40 
watts for the low frequency.

Top HiFi Audio System 

The Top HiFi audio system features a 10 channel amplifier with digital signal processor 
technology for sound control. The Top HiFi amplifier is controlled via the two radio ana¬ 
logue audio signals. 

The Top HiFi amplifier features a digital input for the CD changer. The digital input is only 
used for the BMW Business CD radio and CD changer combination. The 10 loudspeak¬ 
ers are directly connected to the 10 output channels of the Top HiFi amplifier. The active 
frequency gates for adaptation of the loudspeakers are built into the amplifier. 

Depending on the radio, various functions can be called up. Sound control functions such 
as volume, bass, treble, fader, GAL, spatial sound simulation etc. are formed in the Top 
HiFi amplifier. The 7 band graphic equalizer can only be used in connection with the CID 
radio. 


Top HiFi Amplifier 


A fuse is added to the familiar Carver Top HiFi 
amplifier from the E85 but is otherwise installed 
in the E83 without further modifications. 

However, special Carver woofers with increased 
cone excursion are used in the E83 that are used 
in the the E85. The space available in the E83 
and the resonance volume in the side sill enables 
the use of the central bass principle. 



The central woofers in the Top HiFi audio system i. 46-pin connector 
are simply adapted to the increased voltage level 2 . Digital input for cdc 

of the bass end levels (8 . impedance). The 3. Fuse 

amplifier delivers 6 x 20 watts, 

2 x 40 watts and 2 x 100 watts. 


SPDIF 

The digital connection between the Top HiFi 
amplifier and the CD changer is an SPDIF connec¬ 
tion. SPDIF stands for Sony Philips Digital Interface 
and is a data transfer standard for digital audio data. 
The data can be transferred optically via fibre-optic 
cables or via coaxial cables depending on the unit. 

Advantage: the digital data is read by the CD and 
transferred between the units with the highest pos¬ 
sible quality, as no digital/analogue conversion is 
necessary. The Top HiFi amplifier also no longer 
has to carry out analogue/digital conversion. The 
digital data can therefore be processed directly 
from the DSP (Digital Sound Processor).

Telephone System 

The Everest platform for the telephone and telematics functions are used in the US ver¬ 
sion of the E83. For the American market, three different versions are offered: 

• TCU only with telematics function emergency call (E-Call) and breakdown call (13- 
Call). (Optional w/Premium Package 

• TCU with telematic function emergency call and enabling by provider. 

• TCU with telematics and telephone functions via hands-free unit or mobile phone 
(after retrofitting a telephone). 

Telematic Control Unit TCU 

The Telematic Control Unit TCU is optional equipment in US vehicles. This means that 
an emergency call can always be made(if the car is equipped with the TCU), also if the 
customer has not (yet) retrofitted a telephone. 

The range of functions of the US version is as follows: 

• TCU is always fitted in order to ensure the emergency call can be made even if no 
telephone is present 

• Dual-band 800 MHz and 1900 MHz 

• Combined transmit/receive module NAD (Network Access Device) for analog AMPS 
(American Mobile Phone Standard) for telephone calls and digital CDMA (Code 
Division Multiplex Algorithm) for telematics functions 

• Eject box with charging unit for Motorola Phoenix V60 

• Telematics functions (E/B call) 

• GPS receiver for localization 

Principle of Operation 

In the US version, the Telematic Control Unit has an NAD (Network Access Device) that 
works in the AMPS/CDMA standard with the frequencies 800/1900 MHz. The TCU fea¬ 
tures a hands-free system with full-duplex transmission. This makes it possible to speak 
and listen simultaneously. The position of the vehicle is determined by the TCU by means 
of a built-in GPS receiver. In the event of a crash, the TCU sends an SMS with this loca¬ 
tion data to the provider. Furthermore, the TCU has an interface for the connection of an 
emergency call button (E/B Call). The emergency call button is a dual function switch 
with two keys: one for the emergency call and one for the breakdown call. The emer¬ 
gency call button is standard equipment.

Compensator 

The compensator is connected in the aerial cable between the telephone and the roof 
aerial. It balances out the losses of the aerial cable. The compensator is fitted in the lug¬ 
gage compartment on the separating wall to the left of the TCU. 



GPS Aerial 

The GPS aerial permanently receives data regarding the current latitude and longitude 
from the satellites of the Global Positioning System, GPS. This data is transferred to the 
GPS receiver in the TCU, which uses it to determine each position of the vehicle. The 
GPS aerial is integrated in the roof aerial. 

Telephone Aerial 

The telephone aerial is part of the shark fin antenna.
