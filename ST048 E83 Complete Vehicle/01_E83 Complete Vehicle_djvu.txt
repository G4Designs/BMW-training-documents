Introduction 


The E83, X3, conceived and engineered by BMW will be an addition to the X Family of 
SAV’s. Based on the 3 Series Touring (Sportwagon), its size, weight and capabilities 
more closer match those of the X5.

Ll 


The chassis and many parts are taken either directly or in modified form from the 
E46/3-16 or the X5. Almost 35% of the parts were designed specifically for the X3. 

By extending the X family, BMW is strengthening its leading position in the field of on¬ 
road-orientated four-wheel drive SAV's geared towards outstanding driving performance. 

Production 

Due to the outstanding success of all models none of the present-day BMW plants cur¬ 
rently have sufficient capacity to produce the X3 in the intended quantities. 

The BMW Group has therefore entrusted Magna Steyr with the development and pro¬ 
duction of the E83. The vehicle concept has been devised by BMW engineers in Munich 
while production-vehicle development and production take place in Graz/Austria. 

Magna Steyr has already established a sound reputation with complete-vehicle develop¬ 
ments as well as with bodywork or drive train developments. 

It is above all in the 4WD sector that the Austrian's demonstrate an exceptional level of 
technical skill and competence.

E83 Complete Vehicle 













Even mass production is nothing new to Magna Steyr. All 4WD variants of the Mercedes 
E-Class, the Mercedes G-Model, the Chrysler Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Chrysler 
Voyager have been rolling off the production lines in Graz to some extent for years. Magna 
Steyr has regularly received the best marks in quality inspections and tests, carried out by 
among others J. D. Power. 

Models 

The X3 is available with the 3.0 M54 engine and two versions of the 2.5 liter engine, 
the M54. A six speed manual transmission is standard on all X3’s with a 5-speed auto¬ 
matic optional. 

Technical Highlights 

• New four-wheel drive system with variable power distribution (xDrive) 

• Multifunctional panorama glass sunroof 

• Best-in-class ratio of power output and fuel efficiency 



The X3 (Red) is significantly larger than the 3 Series Sportwagon(Blue), but only slightly smaller than the 
X5 (Green).

Body 

The X3 is derived from the E46 sharing many identical parts but is much heavier. Various 
reinforcement measures were necessary to guarantee the required level of rigidity - even 
in the event of a crash. 

Thus the front axle (2-joint spring strut as in the X5) is bolted at 8 points, the front end is 
stabilized with a suspension cross-brace (load factor higher than for the M3), seat cross¬ 
members and reinforcement plates in the B-pillars provide additional protection in the 
event of a side impact and the rear engine brackets are made of high-tensile but light 
"Trip 700" steel. 

The engine in the E83 is lower than in the E46. To ensure sufficient clearance for the 
manifold heat shield, the left engine bracket is shorter than the right. 

The hood has a side support to prevent it from moving in the event of a crash. Held in 
place in this way, the hood cannot jump out of its anchoring to damage the windshield. 

Body Shell 

The Bodyshell panels are stamped and assembled at Magna Steyr. 

Since the bodyshell is made completely of steel, there are few new procedures to 
observe with regards to repair and replacing parts of the body. 

To reduce weight, the front bulkhead (radiator support) of the X3 is made of a hybrid steel 
injection-molded with plastic. The air ducts are cast on. In the case of an accident this 
bulkhead must be replaced rather than repaired. 

The static rigidity of the X3 body is 20,000Nm/degree.

Front Bumper 

The front bumper assembly consists of a 2 part panel, the support member and the 
deforming elements. 

The two panels are made of plastic and clipped and bolted together. The panels must be 
removed from the X3 individually with the outer panel being removed first. 

Attached to the chassis is the aluminum support member and deforming elements. 



Front Bumper Assembly Headlights 


Front Lights 

Halogen headlights are standard, bi-xenon with AHL optional. The headlights are mount¬ 
ed to the forward bulkhead with 4 screws. 

The fog lights are installed in the bumper trim and have adjustment screws accessible 
from the outside (front). 

Doors 

The door panels are attached with 5 screws. 

The trim on the pull handle must be 
removed to access the screws. 

The outside mirror is held to the door by 3 
screws, the cover and mirror are clipped to 
the mirror assembly.

Outside Mirrors 




n 



Exterior Door Handles 


The exterior door handle is a three-piece assembly. It consists of a mounting plate fitted 
from the inside, a handle recess plate fitted from the outside and the handle fitted and 
screwed onto the recess plate from the outside (access screw from outside - arrow).

Workshop Exercise - Exterior Door Handle Removal 


The Instructor will demonstrate the proper door handle release and attachment proce¬ 
dure using mockup parts and special tool. This will familiarize you before attempting 
“on vehicle” removal. After the demonstration is completed, proceed to “on vehicle” 
removal and installation. 


Caution: Lift handle until access hole (to screw) 
is exposed and insert tool to engage in screw, 
do not overtighten securing screw in either 
direction! 

1. To remove door handle, turn screw 
counterclockwise against stop. Pull rear 
of handle up, pivot and pull handle off of 
front pin. 

2. To install handle, position on front pin and 
swivel into place. Push rear of handle 
into socket (lightly) until it snaps in (slight 
resistance). Turn screw clockwise 

until it seats. 



Remove tool, release door handle. 



Workshop Exercise - Replace Painted Mirror Cover 


The customer complains that the mirror cover is scratched. The correct color cover has 
been ordered and received and now must be installed. 


7. Is it possible to remove the painted cover without removing the mirror glass? 


2. What is the proper procedure to remove the mirror glass? 


3. What is the final step in removing the painted mirror cover?

Interior 

The use of forms on the outside is continued on the inside. The X3 is characterized by 
modern styling down to the last detail (e.g. inwardly turning surfaces on the door handle) 
and a strong lifestyle direction. The two-tone color scheme and horizontal shapes con¬ 
vey lightness of touch, power and dynamics. Thanks to the use of diverse materials rang¬ 
ing from sporty aluminum to elegant leather or wood, ample freedom is given a high level 
of individualization. 

The interior concept has taken into account the specific demands made of an SAV. A rear 
bench seat for three rear passengers ensures that up to five persons can sit comfortably 
in their seats in the X3. Knee room of 61 cm provides particular comfort on top of the 
fold-out rear center armrest. 

The wide range of practical storage options, stowage compartments and mounting 
options in the passenger and luggage compartments can be extended still further with 
the option "storage package." 

The X3 is fitted as standard with 4 cup holders, map pockets with nets in the front doors 
and a 4.5-liter glovebox. The storage package features among others additional nets for 
the front and the luggage compartment, mounting rails with variable lashing points and a 
nonslip revolving floor for the luggage compartment. 

The luggage compartment capacity up to the height of the removable interior lid is 480 
liters and with the rear bench seat folded down up to the height of the window edge is 
930 liters. When the vehicle is loaded up to the height of the roofliner, a volume of 1560 
liters becomes available. The single-part tailgate opens upwards, the loading sill is low 
and the rear bench seat can be folded in a ratio of 60 : 40. 


For carrying sports or leisure equipment, the list of options includes a ski bag, a holder for 
mountain bikes (up to two can be stowed inside the vehicle) and a roof rack. 



Heating/Air Conditioning System 

The heating and air conditioning systems are derived from the E46 and are adapted geo¬ 
metrically to the body of the E83.

Communications/Entertainment 


All the technical highlights familiar to BMW can 
also be ordered for the X3. Park Distance 
Control, cut-off ultrasonic interior movement 
detector, bi-xenon headlights and the recently 
introduced adaptive headlight are featured in 
the list of optional extras. 

Hi-Fi and navigation systems (with pop-up 
monitor and DVD) and the telecommunications 
system (Bluetooth interface) represent cutting 
edge technology. The CD changer - for the first 
time in a BMW - is integrated in the center con¬ 
sole for particular ease of use. 



Panorama Glass Sunroof 

One of the highlights of the X3 is a fully automatic, two-part panorama glass sunroof with 
an area of almost one square metre. Its front window section can be fully opened while 
both window sections can also be tilted rearward. The panorama glass sunroof affords an 
outstanding view for the rear occupants and, when fully opened, lends the vehicle the 
impression of being almost a Convertible.

Floating Headliner 


The floating headliner consists of two parts con¬ 
trolled by a Bowden Cable. 

The headliner is interlocked to the function of the 
glass roofs. The headliner must be opened 
before the glass sunroof will open. On closing the 
glass sunroof must be closed before the headlin¬ 
er can be closed. 



Glass Covers 

Two glass covers are installed in the panorama 
sunroof. Six. bolts secure the front glass to the 
frame and four bolts secure the rear glass. 

Power Supply and K-Bus Interface 

The MDS acts as the power supply module for 
both the sunroof motor and the headliner motor. 
Communication with the rest of the car is through 
the K-Bus. The MDS receives and transmits K- 
Bus messages.

2. Rear glass sunroof 

3. Front Floating Headliner 

4. Rear Floating Headliner 


Wind Deflector 

The wind deflector is cable operated by the rear (headliner) motor. 


System Operation 

Operation of the panorama sunroof is similar to the conventional slide/tilt sunroof. It func¬ 
tions both as a tilting sunroof and a slide/tilt sunroof. The rear glass only tilts, the front 
glass slides and tilts. Rear tilt is possible only when the front glass is also tilted.The 
GM5RD signals the MDS for convenience opening and closing of the panorama glass 
sunroof. 

The panorama glass sunroof is operated as follows:

Floating Headliner 


Opening 

On opening the front part of the headliner 
moves over the rear part of the floating headlin¬ 
er. The special feature of the floating headliner 
is that it can be opened fully without the sun¬ 
roof being open or tilted. 

Vent Mode 

When the panorama glass sunroof is moved 
into the tilt position, the floating headliner is 
moved into the vent position. 

The vent position reduces the suction effect at 
high road speeds. 



Wind Deflector 

The wind deflector is regulated according to road speed. When the sunroof is opened the 
wind deflector remains in the down position until road speed is seen by the MDS. Then 
the wind deflector is placed in the extended position. At roads speeds greater than 
140km/h (84mph) it is retracted to an intermediate position. If the road speed drops 
below 10Okm/h, the wind deflector is again raised.

Initialization 

Initialization must be performed on the panorama glass sunroof anytime the MDS looses 
positioning of the glass panels or the headliner or if the any component of the sunroof 
assembly is replaced. 

The control button is pressed and held in the position to tilt the sunroof. Initialization 
begins approximately 15 seconds after pressing the button. The initialization process may 
take over 2 minutes to perform. 

Note: 

The control button MUST be held in the tilt position during the entire initializa¬ 
tion process. Failure to hold the button will result in the initialization procedure 
to be cancelled. 

During initialization the panorama sunroof will operate as follows: 

• Both sunroof panels enter tilt position(Headliners enter Vent Mode) 

• Both Headliners open 

• Both sunroof panels lower 

• The front sunroof panel opens then closes 

• Both Headliners close 

Anti-Trapping Protection 

Both the covers and the floating headliners are fitted with anti-trap protection. If the MDS 
detects something in the path, the appropriate motor is stopped and activated in the 
reverse direction. 


Service Notes 

The motors may be replaced individually. An initialization procedure is required after 
replacing one or both of the motors 

The MDS control unit my be replaced separately. The panorama glass sunroof must be 
recoded and initialized after MDS replacement.
