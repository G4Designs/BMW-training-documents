Lights 

New lighting features for the X5 FL include the following: 

• Revised Front Headlights 

• Redesigned Taillights 

Front Headlights 

The front headlights are all new. Both the High 
and Low beams are now free-form reflectors 
and no longer use glass lenses. The turn signal 
now has a clear lens housing, and the parking 
light uses the optical wave guide technology. 

Clear rings surround the High and Low beam 
reflectors. 

Out put voltage for the light source module 
comes from the parking lamp final stage of the 
LCM IV. 

Bi-Xenon 

Bi-Xenon lights are optional in the X5 3.01 and standard in the 4.41 Operation is the same 
as E46. 



Taillights 

The revised taillights include brake lights, running lights, rear fog lights, reverse and turn 
signal lights. Similar to the headlights, the lenses have been replaced with a clear lens. 
Taillight dimensions remain unchanged.

LCM IV 


Due to improvements in the LCM, the same LCM unit (IV) may be used for both the halo¬ 
gen and bi-xenon lights. 

Check Control Messages 

A modified CC message, Check Gas Cap, replaces the old Check Filler Cap. 

PDC 

Placement of the sensors has changed due to revisions of the front bumpers. 

GM3RD 

The GM3RD has been Redesigned to accommodate new functions in theX5 FL. While 
some pin assignments have changed, operation and diagnostics remain the same. 

New features of the GM3RD include: 

• Revised software and hardware 

• Adaptation of HW for Interior Lighting (IB) changes 

• Additional Load Deactivation (VA2) to support peripheral control units 

• Integration of Soft Close Actuator (SCA) 


The primary reason for the redesign of the GM3 was to integrate a new microprocessor. 
Additionally, other hardware changes were also implemented requiring a new printed cir¬ 
cuit board. 

• Semiconductor control of lock activations (not relay) 

• Integrated Optical Entry Assist (OEH) 

• SCA 

• Elimination of heat sink 

• Pulse width modulated (PWM) signal for the interior lighting (IB), 
and reading lights supply line (VA) 

Load Deactivation 

Load Deactivation remains the same. 

There are now two VA outputs from the GM3RD. VA1 is a PWM signal and VA2 is 
not PWM.

Softclose Actuator (SCA) 

The softclose actuator system for the rear upper hatch is new for the E53 Facelift pack¬ 
age. The purpose of the SCA system is to automatically pull the upper lift-gate fully 
closed once the customer lowers the hatch, and to automatically release the hatch once 
the opening process is initiated. The controlling function for the SCA is integrated into 
the GM3. 

System Components 

• SCA Assembly 

Locking Pawls 

Mechanical Components (Gears, springs, etc.) 

Load Protection Device 
Motor 

Hall Sensor system 

• Pushbutton Switches 

• Relay SCA Open 

• Relay SCA Close 

SCA Assembly 

Prior to this change, a micro-switch located in the upper lift-gate was used to provide the 
status of the lift-gate to the GM3 body electronics control module. For the 10/03 facelift, 
the micro-switch has been replaced with Hall Sensors for greater reliability. The hall sen¬ 
sors report the status of the lift-gate to the GM3. The GM3 responds to the status sig¬ 
nals and provides the outputs to the relays that control the SCA motor. The GM3 also 
uses these input signals to control the upper hatch luggage compartment lights and to 
trigger the DWA anti-theft alarm. 

Pushbutton Switches 

The upper and lower lift-gates can be opened electrically in the same manner as before 
by using the respective switches in the upper and lower lift-gate. Additionally, the upper 
lift-gate can be opened using the center console switch, or the remote key. 

The pushbutton switches for the upper lift-gate must be pressed for at least 200 ms in 
order for an electrical opening of the upper hatch to be initiated. 

The SCA motor is not activated if the battery voltage is lower than 9 volts. In a crash situ¬ 
ation (crash telegram generated), the lift-gate opening function is blocked for 10 seconds 
for additional safety.

X5 FL 


Relay SCA Open 

The GM3 controls the SCA Open relay K112 by applying a ground signal to the relay coil, 
which switches KL30 voltage to the motor. 

Relay SCA Close 

The GM3 controls the SCA Close relay K70 by applying a ground signal to the relay 
coil,which switches KL30 voltage to the motor pulling the liftgate closed. 

SCA Functions 

• Disabling of liftgate operation while vehicle is moving 

• Disabling of liftgate for 10s following a crash 

• Opening of the upper liftgate from the outside/inside electrically via a pushbutton 
(minimum actuation duration 200 ms) and remote control. 

• Opening the lower liftgate via pushbutton on the lower liftgate. 

• Dimmed activation and deactivation of the interior lighting and luggage compart¬ 
ment lighting via the body electronics control module. 

• The Pawl Sensor is an anti-theft alarm system trigger. 

• Activation of the SCA motor in order to automatically close the SCA latch into the 
primary position after engagement in the secondary position by means of the “pull- 
closed” function. 

• Activation of the SCA motor must occur in order to open the SCA latch when the 
vehicle is at a standstill. 

• Activation of the SCA motor via two relays, activation of the lower liftgate motor and 
the luggage compartment light directly via the GM3RD

Communication Systems 

The Navigation System, Business Radio and DSP Amplifier all have revised software and 
hardware. While the changes internally may be dramatic, there will no apparent change 
to the customer. 

Telephone System 

The X5 FL now include a TCU as standard equipment. Operation of the system is the 
same as E65/E60 equipped with the Everest Platform. 

Installation of the eject box, cell phone antenna and compensator will be performed at the 
dealership.
