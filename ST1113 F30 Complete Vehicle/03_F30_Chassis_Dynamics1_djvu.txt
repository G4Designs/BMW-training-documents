The two-joint spring strut front axle with trailing links in the F30 represents the optimum combination 
of driving dynamics and ride comfort. The load-bearing function of the steering box housing achieves 
an extremely high degree of rigidity with the lowest possible weight. 


Compared to its predecessor in the E90, the front axle support in the F30 must satisfy more stringent 
requirements. A second crash load path has now been integrated above the front axle support. In order 
to guarantee optimum crash behavior, a high-strength welded steel structure has been used instead of 
an aluminium front axle support. 

Improved acoustic properties and maximum rigidity and accompanying increase in ride comfort can be 
achieved with a small installation space.

3. Chassis and Suspension 

The ball joints of the front axle have been friction-optimized. This has made it possible to improve the 
response characteristics. 

Use of cast aluminium parts (wishbones, trailing links) and aluminium die-cast parts (swivel bearings) 
reduces the unsprung masses. 

The Electronic Power Steering EPS (electromechanical power steering) that features in the F30 makes 
an important contribution to BMW EfficientDynamics. 

For vehicles with an adaptive M sports suspension (optional equipment 2VF) the electronic damper 
control EDC is also integrated.

In the F30 a five-link rear axle has been used. HA5 This is based on the predecessor but has under¬ 
gone significant further development and has been implemented as a steel construction. 

Elasto-kinematics are installed in the five-link rear axle, which are coordinated specifically to the F30. 
The precise and superior wheel control in all driving situations has a large spring travel range. 

It has been possible to resolve the conflicting objectives of driving dynamics and comfort by: 

• A flexible suspension of rear axle differential at rear axle support and a flexible bearing of rear 
axle support at body (2x flexible bearing), which have been specifically coordinated to the F30 

• Maximum support base width for the rear axle support 

• Significant increase in track width when compared to E90 

• Optimum connection of body suspension and damping.

Specific aerodynamic measures improve the lift coefficients and the drag coefficient (Cd), which has 
a positive impact on consumption and driving dynamics. Thus aerodynamic covers made of fibre- 
glass-reinforced polyamide has been fitted to the camber links of the F30. 

When compared to the E90 , it has been possible to increase the loading width of the luggage com¬ 
partment and leg room in the rear passenger compartment.

The shock absorber design of the F30 and E90 are different. In the F30, firstly the pivot point of the 
shock absorber to the camber link was modified, and secondly no more work is necessary in the lug¬ 
gage compartment for dismantling the shock absorber. 

The support bearing with single load path for the shock absorber in the E90 is screwed to the body 
from the inside. The support bearing in the F30 is a multiple-path version and is fastened to the body 
from the outside.

3.3. Suspension/dampers 

3.3.1. Basic chassis and suspension 

Steel springs are mounted to the front and rear axle of the F30. 

Damping is provided by conventional shock absorbers as standard. Spring struts are installed at the 
front axle and springs and dampers are arranged separately at the rear axle. 

3.3.2. M Sports suspension 

Vehicles with M Sports suspension (optional equipment 704) have a tighter spring/damper design and 
are positioned 10 mm lower. 


3.3.3. Adaptive M chassis and suspension 

Vehicles with an adaptive M sports suspension (optional equipment 2VF) are also positioned 10 mm 
lower. 

In addition, the electronic damper control EDC is integrated. Here four continuously adjustable shock 
absorbers with coupled rebound/compression stage adjustment produce damping forces according to 
requirements. The shock absorbers can automatically assume a harder setting (more dynamic/sporty) 
or softer (more comfortable) setting, depending on the driving manoeuvre. 

For more information on the EDC refer to Chapter "Electronic Damper Control (EDC)".

5. Steering 


5.1. Electronic Power Steering EPS 

The F30 features Electronic Power Steering EPS (electromechanical power steering) which replaces 
the conventional hydraulic steering. 

When compared to hydraulic steering, with EPS the power assist is applied to the rack via an electric 
motor and a reduction gear.

Thanks to the supply of condition-based power, the average fuel consumption has been reduced by 
approx. 3% compared to conventional hydraulic power steering. This helps reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions. 

As there is no oil in an EPS system, it is more environmentally friendly and easier to service than a con¬ 
ventional hydraulic power steering system. 

Owing to the compact design of the steering gear with integrated electric motor and control electron¬ 
ics, the installation and maintenance overheads are considerably less than a conventional hydraulic 
power steering system. 

With EPS, both the steering servo (steering force) and return can be freely balanced. Steerability and 
drivability can therefore be adapted optimally to the relevant driving situation (e.g. when driving in built- 
up areas or on the highway).

F30 Chassis Dynamics 

5. Steering 

Servotronic is installed as standard equipment on the F30. The Servotronic controls the steering servo 
subject to the vehicle speed. Two different settings (“Normal” and “Sporty”) can be accessed via the 
driving experience switch. 

Active steering is not available for the F30, "Variable sports steering" (SA 2VL) is instead available as 
optional equipment. 

The EPS a prerequisite for implementation of the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant PMA. 

Depending on the F30 options two variants of steering gear are used: 

• EPS basic steering gear for BMW 328i and 335i. 

With this steering gear the housing and the mechanics are designed for higher axle loads. The 
electrical motor is enhanced and the engine shortened. 

Manufacturer: ThyssenKrupp. 

• EPS for variable sport steering (optional equipment 2VL). 

In terms of the housing, this steering gear corresponds to the mechanics and the engine of the 
EPS for BMW 328i and 335i. However, the electric motor is designed for the higher dynamics 
of sport steering. In addition, a rack with variable ratio is installed. 

Manufacturer: ThyssenKrupp.

5.1.3. Steering angle sensor 

The information on the steering angle in the F30 is not recorded by the Electronic Power Steering EPS 
via a separate sensor on the steering wheel and instead is computed based on the angle of the EPS 
motor position in relation to the steering wheel. 

The EPS transmits the position of the rack to the ICM control unit via FlexRay. During this process, 
the EPS calculates the absolute position of the rack based on the current rotor position of the EPS 
motor and the number of complete revolutions performed by the rotor starting from the zero position 
(straight-ahead driving position). 

Taking this position as the starting point, the ICM control unit determines the wheel-specific steering 
angle among other things using the stored ratio parameters (rack to wheel-specific steering angle) and 
transmits this via FlexRay. This wheel-specific steering angle is used by the DSC among other things 
as a reference variable for internal control functions. 

In cases where the absolute value is not available from the EPS (loss of Terminal 30, flash process), the 
absolute value is determined through interaction between the ICM and EPS using a teaching function 
in which the steering wheel is turned from end stop to end stop (e.g. straight-ahead position -> left -> 
right -> straight-ahead position). 


5.2. Variable sport steering 

The "Variable sport steering" (optional equipment 2VL) is available for the F30 as an alternative to the 
basic version of EPS. This is the first steering system on the market to combine the benefits of an ex¬ 
tremely direct, variable steering gear ratio and the operating principle of EPS. 

The variable sport steering increases both ride comfort and agility. The direct ratio reduces the over¬ 
all steering angle, i.e. the number of turns of the steering wheel required to turn from one steering stop 
to the other, by roughly 25%. This therefore helps manoeuvres that require a larger steering angle, e.g. 
parking, turning off or turning round, to be carried out more comfortably. 


24 









F30 Chassis Dynamics 

5. Steering 

The more direct steering gear ratio when compared to the basic version of the EPS and the reduced 
steering angle which is required as a result achieves a more direct vehicle response and higher agility. 
This comes in handy during avoidance manoeuvres for example. 

The variable steering gear ratio is implemented through the stroke-dependent gear geometry of the 
rack. Around the center position of the steering gear, the steering system behaves accurately with 
steady directional stability. As the steering angle moves away from the center position, the ratio be¬ 
comes increasingly more direct.

Thanks to an integrated crash system, in the event of an accident the steering column can dissipate 
additional energy through specific deformation. 

5.3.1. Steering column adjustment 

The steering column of the F30 can be adjusted mechanically; a forward/back adjustment of 60 mm 
and height adjustment of 40 mm is possible. This allows optimum ergonomic positioning of the driver.

6.2.2. System function 

The Integrated Chassis Management ICM coordinates, as monitoring system so to speak, all driving 
stability control systems and vehicle control systems. The advantage of this structure is that the in¬ 
dividual systems can continue processing their immediate functions rapidly and also independently. 

As the higher-level central control system, the ICM monitors and coordinates interventions and sends 
instructions to intelligent actuators. This allows braking, steering or torque interventions to be per¬ 
formed, for example. 

Influence of ICM control uniton driving stability control 

* Driving dynamics control FDR 

The driver can activate and deactivate the driving dynamics control (FDR) via the DTC but¬ 
ton or the driving experience switch. The function mode is displayed in the instrument cluster 
KOMBI. 

The ICM control unit evaluates the DTC button and driving experience switch as well as the 
switching logic, as well as communication between the various systems involved (including 
DSC). Furthermore, the ICM control unit includes system monitoring of partner functions 
which switches back to normal mode (DSC ON) if one of the functions being monitored drops 
out. 

* Dynamic Cruise Control DCC 

Dynamic Cruise Control DCC is a road speed controller with braking intervention. The DCC 
function in the ICM control unit acts on the powertrain and brake via corresponding interfaces. 
In addition, interfaces exist with display and operating elements and the driving dynamics sen¬ 
sor systems. 

Further information on the DCC can be found in the chapter entitled "Dynamic Cruise Control 
DCC". 

* Active cruise control with Stop&Go function (optional equipment 5DF) Not at start of 
production. 

The active cruise control with Stop&Go function (ACC Stop & Go) is a speed regulator with a 
distance regulator function. The "ACC Stop & Go" function in the ICM control unit acts on the 
powertrain and brake via corresponding interfaces. In addition, interfaces exist with display and 
operating elements and the driving dynamics sensor systems. 


Sensor system 

As the central element, the ICM control unit incorporates the driving dynamics sensors and central 
airbag sensor system. It is installed near the vehicle's center of gravity via a holder on the center con¬ 
sole.

6.3. Dynamic Stability Control DSC 

The Dynamic Stability Control DSC forms the core of the vehicle control systems that enhance active 
safety. It optimizes driving stability in all driving conditions and also traction when driving off and ac¬ 
celerating. Furthermore, it identifies unstable driving conditions such as understeering or oversteering 
and helps maintain the vehicle on a steady course. 

In the F30 two variants of the DSC are used. In the basic version the hydraulic unit has an internal pres¬ 
sure sensor and a double piston pump. For vehicles with active cruise control with Stop&Go function 
(optional equipment 5DF) “Not at start of production” a version with two additional pressure sensors is 
installed. 

The ultra sensitive sensors of the F30 record the current driving condition permanently. The informa¬ 
tion comes for example from the wheel speed, steering angle, lateral acceleration, longitudinal acceler¬ 
ation, pressure and yaw sensors (detect rotation on the vehicle's vertical axis). The single-track mod¬ 
el calculated by the DSC control unit serves as the basic variable for control interventions in the DSC. 
During this process, the relevant driver input (steering wheel angle and vehicle speed), in other words 
"the desired state", and the vehicle sensor data, in other words "the actual state", are compared. 

If the calculated desired state and measured actual state do not correspond, stabilizing or traction-en¬ 
hancing measures are introduced once defined tolerances have been exceeded. Driving stability can 
once again be ensured or a traction requirement can be implemented by selectively reducing or in¬ 
creasing the engine torque (with active engine drag torque control) or through wheel-specific brake in¬ 
tervention.

Adopting a suitably adapted driving style always remains the responsibility of the driver. 

Not even DSC can overcome the laws of physics. 

The additional safety features afforded by the system should not be diminished by risky driving. 


6.4. Dynamic Cruise Control DCC 

Dynamic Cruise Control DCC is a cruise control with comfortable brake intervention. DCC keeps the 
chosen speed constant above speeds of roughly 30 km/h - when compared to conventional cruise 
control with the following additional functions: 

• Active brake intervention - if the engine drag torque is insufficient in coasting (overrun) 
mode to maintain the chosen speed, the vehicle is decelerated automatically through addition¬ 
al controlled brake intervention. 

• Curve Speed Limiter (CSL) - Depending on the actual lateral acceleration, the driving speed 
is reduced during controlled cornering as necessary. When coming out of the bend the speed 
is adjusted until it once again reaches the desired level. 


34 

















F30 Chassis Dynamics 

6. Driving Stability Control 


• Comfort Dynamic System (CDS) - Referred to as "Hand-controlled acceleration mode", this 
feature allows the driver to accelerate or decelerate continuously via an operating element on 
the steering wheel in two dynamic stages respectively. The driver can thus accelerate or de¬ 
celerate in the traffic flow without having to estimate the target speed beforehand. 

• Adapted downhill driving - Maintaining the desired speed during controlled downhill driv¬ 
ing is effected by overrun fuel cutoff and adapted gear downshifting. The wheel brakes are re¬ 
lieved and the fuel consumption reduced. With the DSC braking control system, correspond¬ 
ing measures are applied via a substitute temperature model to compensate for leaks and 
distribute torque between the front and rear axle. This means that any leaks that occur in the 
braking control circuit can be counteracted. 

The desired/resume speed is indicated in the instrument cluster KOMBI by a mark that moves round 
the speed reading. Depending on the system status the marking illuminates in green (active) or orange 
(system interrupted). 

If the desired speed is adjusted, or when the DCC function is activated, the updated digital value ap¬ 
pears briefly in the display as acknowledgement for the driver. 


6.5. Electronic Damper Control (EDC) 

For vehicles with an adaptive M sports suspension (optional equipment 2VF) the electronic damper 
control EDC is used. Here four continuously adjustable shock absorbers with coupled rebound/com¬ 
pression stage adjustment produce damping forces according to requirements. The shock absorbers 
can automatically assume a harder setting (more dynamic/sporty) or softer (more comfortable) setting, 
depending on the driving manoeuvre.

6.5.3. System function 

The Electronic Damper Control EDC is a variable, electronically controlled shock absorber adjustment 
system that controls the vertical dynamics. The EDC adapts the damping forces of the shock absorber 
more or less instantly to the changing road or driving conditions. 

The Electronic Damper Control (EDC) comes with the optional equipment SA 2VF "Adaptive M sports 
suspension". 

The EDC consists of: 

• Four continuously adjustable shock absorbers with coupled rebound/compression stage ad¬ 
justment 

• The VDM control unit 

• Two wheel acceleration sensors on the front axle to determine the wheel movement 

• Sensor cluster integrated into the ICM control unit which determines the body movements 
(pitch, vertical, roll). 

The sensors in the vehicle permanently measure: 

• The body and wheel acceleration 

• The current lateral and longitudinal acceleration 

• The vehicle speed 

• The steering wheel position. 


38 











F30 Chassis Dynamics 

6. Driving Stability Control 

Based on this measured data, the VDM control unit calculates the control commands to be sent to the 
electromagnetic valves in the shock absorbers for each individual wheel according to the road profile 
and driving situation. This means that the damping forces will always be applied according to require¬ 
ments. 

This improves ride comfort and also increases driving dynamics. 

This improves the vehicle's: 

• Suitability for long-distance journeys 

• Enhanced body stability and agility 

• Improves driving safety by minimizing wheel load fluctuations and reducing the stopping dis¬ 
tance. 

The driver can choose between the more comfortable or more sporty aspect of the vehicle's character 
via the driving experience switch. 

6.5.4. Notes for Service 

Separate lines are still used between the dampers, including the sensors at the front axle and wiring 
harness. These are not shown in the system wiring diagram and can be replaced individually when car¬ 
rying out repairs.
