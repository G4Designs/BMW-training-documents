2.3.1. Detailed measurement 

Prerequisites: 

• Vehicle standing on a level road with the engine running at normal at operating temperature 

• Manual gearbox: gearshift lever in neutral, clutch and accelerator pedals not pressed 

• Automatic transmission: selector lever in position N or P and accelerator pedal not pressed. 

Measurement must be started from the Vehicle Information menu and takes roughly one minute, in the 
course of which the idle speed is automatically increased slightly. The engine oil level is then indicated 
on a scale. 

2.4. Engine identification 

2.4.1. Engine designation 

In the technical documentation, the engine designation is used to ensure unambiguous identification 
of the engine. However, an abbreviated engine designation (e.g. N20) is often used which only allows 
the engine type classification.

2.4.2. Engine identification 

The engines have an identification mark on the crankcase to ensure unambiguous identification and 
classification. This engine identification is also necessary for approval by government authorities. 

With the N55 engine, this identification has been subject to a further development, with the previous 
eight positions being reduced to seven. The engine number can be found on the engine below the en¬ 
gine identification. This consecutive number, in conjunction with the engine identification, permits un¬ 
ambiguous identification of each individual engine.

3.1.2. Fuel delivery 

For vehicles with N20 or N55 engine the fuel tank has a volume of 60 liters. It is designed as a saddle 
tank on account of the installation area in the vehicle. The fuel supply system has a so-called delivery 
unit and a sensor unit. The delivery unit is accommodated in the right half, and the sensor unit in the 
left half of the fuel tank. The first fill valve (1) ensures that fuel is introduced into the surge tank during 
refuelling when the surge tank is completely empty. It also acts as an inlet, in that there is no active fill¬ 
ing of the surge tank. 

The fuel flows via the suction strainer (2) to the electric fuel pump (3) with non-return valve (4) and 
pressure limiting valve (5). It flows further via the fuel filter (6) with pressure regulator (7) to the feed 
line (8). The electric fuel pump sits in the surge tank and is adjusted via the electronic fuel pump con¬ 
trol unit EKPS (12). The delivery pressure is configured at 5.8 bar. 

The suction jet pump (9) conveys the fuel via an additional line from the left half of the fuel tank to the 
surge tank. The location of the suction jet pump (9) in the surge tank is new. 


14 















F30 Powertrain 

3. Fuel Supply 

When the engine is switched off, the delivery pressure is maintained for a certain amount of time on 
account of the hot-start response. The feed line cannot run dry, even after the dwell time, because air 
cannot get in with the system being airtight. The non-return valve (4) prevents the fuel tank from leak¬ 
ing in the event of damage to the lines on the engine or underbody. 

3.1.3. Tank ventilation system 

An overpressure protection function (B) is integrated in the fuel filler cap (A). The overpressure pro¬ 
tection function ensures, in the event of a problem with the tank ventilation system, that any excess 
pressure that forms can escape and the fuel tank is not damaged. A non-return valve (C) is located at 
the end of the fuel filler neck. The non-return valve prevents fuel from sloshing back into the fuel filler 
neck. The non-return valve is closed by a spring so that it is fluid-tight. 

The components in the fuel tank are accessible through the service opening on the right, which is an 
integral part of the delivery module (F). 

The fuel level is detected via the two lever sensors (G). 

The surge tank (D) ensures that enough fuel is always available to the electric fuel pump (3) for deliv¬ 
ery. The surge tank is also an integral part of the delivery module and can thus be changed. 

The refuelling ventilation valve with fuel tank overfill protection facility (I) is situated in a high position. 
The valve closes if the fill level reaches this height during refuelling. The air can no longer escape fast 
enough from the fuel tank, thereby causing the fuel in the filler pipe to rise and the fuel pump nozzle to 
cut out. 

Ventilation is effected during operation while the refuelling ventilation valve is closed via the service 
vent valves (H). They have a smaller opening diameter they alone would not allow the air to escape fast 
enough from the fuel tank during refuelling. The service vent valves are arranged in such a way that 
ventilation is also possible when the vehicle is at an inclination of 18°. 

The integrated fuel tank overfill protection facility is provided by a ball, which closes the vent hole as 
a result of its own weight. A fuel tank overfill protection facility is necessary to safeguard the compen¬ 
sation volume in the tank. When the refuelling ventilation valve has closed, in order to guarantee the 
compensating volume maintained in the tank an overpressure is built up in the tank by the integrated 
fuel tank overfill protection facility. This overpressure causes the fuel level in the fuel filler pipe to rise 
and thus the fuel pump nozzle to cut out. 

During operation the pressure can rise due to the temperature increase. If the pressure in the fuel tank 
(fill level above the service vent valves) reaches approx. 30 mbar above the ambient pressure, the ball is 
lifted and the pressure can escape via the liquid trap (P). Entrained fuel is retained in the liquid trap and 
returned to the tank. In this way, ventilation is possible even when the fuel tank is full without the risk of 
overfilling.

MSA II System Components 


4.1. System Overview 

4.1.1. Automatic start/stop function - Manual transmission 

When the car is stopped and the driver engages neutral and releases the clutch pedal, the automatic 
start/stop function switches the engine off. This means that the vehicle does not use any fuel when it is 
at a standstill. When the driver depresses the clutch pedal again, the engine is automatically restarted 
and the driver can continue driving. 

4.1.2. Automatic start/stop function - Automatic transmission 

The automatic engine start-stop function switches off the engine when the vehicle is brought to a 
standstill, the selector lever remains in the D position, and the driver depresses the brake pedal to hold 
the vehicle at a standstill. This means that the car does not use any fuel when it is at a standstill. When 
the driver releases the brake pedal again, the engine is automatically restarted and the driver can con¬ 
tinue driving. 

The description that follows therefore deals specifically with the automatic start/stop function in con¬ 
junction with the automatic transmission. 


16 









F30 Powertrain 

4. Automatic Start/Stop II (MSA II) 


The engine will NOT automatically turn OFF if: 

• Outside temperature below 37.4°F. 

• Outside temperature above 95°F. 

• Vehicle interior is not yet warmed up or cooled down. 

• Engine is not yet warmed up. 

• Vehicle battery state of charge very low. 

• After vehicle was driven in reverse. 

• Steering wheel operated after vehicle stopped. 

• Stop&Go Traffic. 

• GWS selector in Sport/Manual mode. 

If MSA is active (ENGINE OFF), the engine will be turned ON automatically if: 

• Interior temperature cannot be maintained (cooling and heating). 

• Windshield fogging. 

• Vehicle battery state of charge drops below a threshold. 

• Steering wheel input is detected. 

• Change gear lever position from D to N; D to M/S; P to D. 

• The accelerator and the brake pedal are pressed at the same time. 

• ECO PRO mode activated. 

4.1.3. DC/DC converter 

The higher frequency of starting operations in vehicles with the automatic start/stop function can lead 
to voltage dips in the vehicle electrical system. One DC/DC converter is installed in order to protect 
specific voltage-sensitive components (depending on the vehicle equipment). 

The DC/DC converter supplies a constant voltage to the 30B_DC/DC terminals, also during the start¬ 
ing operation. 

A DC/DC converter is installed only if the following options are installed: 

• Harmon Kardon Surround Sound System (SA 688)

4. Automatic Start/Stop II (MSA II) 

4.2. Automatic mode 

The automatic start/stop function is ready for operation following every engine start. 

The function is activated once the vehicle reaches a specific speed: 

• Vehicles with manual transmission: > 5 km/h/3 mph. 

• Vehicles with automatic transmission: > 9 km/h/5 mph. 

The driver presence detection via the seat belt buckle switch and also via the door contact has been 
introduced as a new feature of MSA II. 

When the driver leaves the vehicle, the automatic start/stop function is deactivated, in order to prevent 
the engine from starting automatically. 

The MSA function is always reactivated if: 

• the driver's seat belt is fastened and the vehicle is travelling at a speed of > 5 km/h/3 mph 

• the driver's door is closed and the vehicle is travelling at a speed of > 5 km/h/3 mph*. 

* > 9 km/h/5 mph - vehicles with automatic transmission 

The prerequisites for deactivation of the automatic start/stop function vary, depending on which 
switching mode the seatbelt buckle switch and door contact are in when the automatic start/stop func¬ 
tion is activated:

4.2.1. Driving 

The purpose of the automatic start/stop function is to switch the engine off when the vehicle is at a 
standstill. As long as the vehicle is in motion the driver will not be aware of the automatic start/stop 
function.

4.2.2. Stopping 

From the driver's point of view, the stopping process with subsequent engine stop is as follows: 



Index 

Explanation 


1 

Vehicle slows to a standstill, e.g. at a red light 


2 

Selector lever remains in the "D" drive position, driver depresses the brake 
pedal to decelerate and hold the vehicle at a standstill

4. Automatic Start/Stop II (MSA II) 


In the situation depicted above the driver holds the car at a standstill by depressing the brake pedal. 

Alternatively, the driver can select selector lever position "P" and release the brake pedal. The engine 
remains switched off. If then the drive position "D" is subsequently engaged, the engine starts without 
delay. 

4.2.3. Driving off 

The driver indicates his intention to drive off by releasing the brake pedal. 

If the driver previously held the car at a standstill by depressing the brake pedal, the engine starts as 
soon as the driver releases the brake pedal.

2 

The selector lever remains in drive position "D", driver releases the brake pedal 

3 

Engine is started, revolution counter and fuel consumption display revert back 
to normal to reflect the driving situation 


If the driver moves the selector lever into position "P" after the engine was switched off automatically, 
the engine starts automatically if the selector lever is now moved to position "D". 

During this process, the automatic engine start is not activated automatically via a signal from the 
brake light switch, but by the DSC control unit that monitors the brake pressure. 

4.2.4. Establishing start-up readiness 

If the driver wants to start the engine but not yet drive off, he can establish start-up readiness by: 

• Pressing the brake pedal briefly, applying more force 

• Releasing the brake pedal slightly 

Both of these actions will prompt the engine to start automatically.

4.2.5. Automatic hold 

If the driver has activated the "Automatic Hold" function, he/she can also release the brake pedal once 
the vehicle has come to a standstill. The automatic start/stop function also switches the engine off in 
this case. The car is held at a standstill by the DSC hydraulics. The engine only starts if the driver oper¬ 
ates the accelerator pedal. 

4.2.6. Preventing automatic engine shutdown 

In order to be able to drive off quickly, e.g. at a crossing, the automatic engine shutdown can be ac¬ 
tively prevented if within one second after the vehicle comes to a standstill the brake pedal is pressed 
briefly, applying more force than usual, then immediately held with the usual brake pedal force.

4.3. Switch-off inhibitors 

Under certain conditions it is necessary to suppress the MSA function: 

• the vehicle is coasting (vehicles with manual transmission only) 

• the brake vacuum is too low (vehicles with manual transmission only) 

• the brake pedal is not pressed firmly enough which means the vehicle is detected as not being 
held sufficiently (vehicles with automatic transmission only) 

• the vehicle stops on uphill/downhill gradients > 12% 

• the steering angle is > 6° 

• the steering wheel movement is not yet complete (as otherwise insufficient support will be 
provided by the power steering as a consequence)

• the vehicle was not driven at a speed of > 5 km/h/3 mph* following the previous engine shut¬ 
down 

• the engine is not running at idle speed (accelerator pedal is being pressed) 

• the vehicle is being driven in reverse 

• the Hill Descent Control (HDC) has been activated 

• the operating temperature of the engine is too low 

• the carbon canister is being purged 

• the fuel grade is insufficient 

• the gearbox adaptation is active (vehicles with automatic transmission only) 

• the hydraulic pressure accumulator is not charged yet (vehicles with automatic transmission 
only) 

• stop-and-go traffic 

• the state of charge is too low 

• the ambient temperature is below +3 °C/ 37.4 °F (ice warning) 

• the ambient temperature is above +35 °C/ 95 °F (with heating and air conditioning system 

switched on) 

• the condensation sensor of the IHKA detects fogging of the windshield 

• the heating and air conditioning system is switched on but the passenger compartment has 
not yet warmed up or cooled down to the required temperature 

• the brakes have been applied via ABS. 

* > 9 km/h/5 mph - vehicles with automatic transmission 

4.4. Switch-on prompts 

Conversely, it may be necessary to start the engine under the following conditions: 

• the vehicle is not sufficiently held by the released brake pedal (vehicles with automatic trans¬ 
mission only) 

• the steering wheel is moved 

• the engine is not running at idle speed (accelerator pedal is being pressed) 

• the transmission changes from "P" to "D"; the driver previously shifted from "D" to "P" when 
the engine was automatically switched off (vehicles with automatic transmission only) 

• the transmission changes from "D" to "N" or "R" (vehicles with automatic transmission only) 

• the state of charge is too low 

• the ambient temperature is above +35 °C/95 °F (with heating and air conditioning system 
switched on) 

• the condensation sensor of the IHKA detects fogging of the windshield 

• the evaporator temperature is too low to ensure sufficient climate control.

4.5. Deactivation 

If a deactivation condition exists, the automatic start/stop function is deactivated. 

The following scenarios arise, depending on when the deactivation condition for the automatic start/ 
stop function occurred: 

• the engine continues running and is no longer stopped automatically 

• the engine was stopped automatically and starts once again automatically 

• the engine was stopped automatically and no longer starts automatically (the Check Control 
message "MSA off" appears - the start/stop button must be operated in order to the start the 
engine). 

The following deactivation conditions may occur: 

• the driver's absence has been detected 

• the engine did not start when starting 

• the engine compartment lid is unlocked 

• a fault related to the automatic start/stop function has been detected at the engine, transmis¬ 
sion or components involved in the automatic start/stop function 

• the bus communication is faulty 

• the automatic start/stop function has been deactivated via the automatic start/stop function 
button 

• the automatic start/stop function was deactivated via the diagnosis system 

• the vehicle is in transport mode 

• the engine was stalled. 

The individual statuses can be read out using the diagnosis system. 

An easy-to-follow example of a deactivation with subsequent switch-on request: 

• the automatic start/stop function is deactivated via the automatic start/stop function button in 
the automatic engine shutdown phase 

• as a consequence, the engine starts automatically 

• after this, no further automatic engine shutdowns occur, the automatic start/stop function re¬ 
mains deactivated.

4.5.1. Deactivation via automatic start/stop function button 



F30 automatic start/stop function button location 


The automatic start/stop function can be deactivated manually via the automatic start/stop function 
button (1). The LED in the button lights up when the function is deactivated. The automatic start/stop 
function is reactivated each time the engine is restarted. 


4.6. Hydraulic pressure accumulator 

When the automatic start/stop function is activated the engine may shut off once the vehicle is at a 
standstill, the engine restarts automatically as the driver releases the brake to drive off. 

In these engine stop phases the transmission oil pump is not driven, thus the fluid pressure supply 
ceases, the gearshift elements open, and there is no longer a transfer of power in the transmission. 
Maximum transmission oil pressure is required in order for the drive off process to take place dynami¬ 
cally without a noticeable delay when the automatic start/stop function is activated. However, the me¬ 
chanically driven transmission oil pump cannot build up pressure quickly enough while the engine is 
starting. 

A hydraulic pressure accumulator is therefore used in the automatic transmission for this purpose (as 
with F04). With the volume of transmission fluid stored in the hydraulic pressure accumulator, the shift 
elements can be filled as soon as the engine is started, even before the transmission oil pump has built 
up the necessary pressure to drive off.

4. Automatic Start/Stop II (MSA II) 

The hydraulic pressure accumulator consists of a hydraulic cylinder. This cylinder contains a piston 
that moves against the force of a spring. The piston can be electromechanically locked in the ten¬ 
sioned end position. The electromechanical latch mechanism incorporates locking balls, a tension 
spring, a release spring, and a solenoid. 

The solenoid is activated and deactivated by the EGS. A corresponding wiring harness to the hydraulic 
pressure accumulator is laid inside the transmission housing. 

The cylinder of the hydraulic pressure accumulator is connected to the transmission's hydraulic sys¬ 
tem directly (without any valves between them). The hydraulic pressure accumulator in fact contains 
an element which functions as a throttle and non-return valve. The throttle limits the volumetric flow of 
the fluid while the hydraulic pressure accumulator is being filled. In general, this filling operation corre¬ 
sponds to the charging operation of the accumulator which is why the expressions "charging" or "dis¬ 
charging" are used in this description. 

The non-return valve ensures that the transmission fluid flows into the hydraulic pressure accumula¬ 
tor via the throttle during charging. The transmission fluid does not flow through the throttle during the 
discharging process, the non-return valve now opens instead to allow an unrestricted flow of transmis¬ 
sion fluid back into the hydraulic system. The purpose of the non-return valve is therefore not to main¬ 
tain the pressure in the charged state. In the charged state, the transmission fluid in the hydraulic pres¬ 
sure accumulator is depressurized and the energy is stored in the tensioned spring. 

4.6.3. Charging 

The hydraulic pressure accumulator is therefore always charged when the engine is running and the 
transmission oil pump is working. During charging transmission fluid flows through the throttle into the 
hydraulic cylinder. In the process only a small volume is drawn from the hydraulic system so that the 
pressure level does not drop unintentionally. The transmission fluid pushes on the piston which acts 
against the spring force increasing the tension on the spring.

4

At the end of the charging process the piston travels past the latch mechanism (locking balls) until it 
reaches the end/stop. The transmission fluid pressure holds the piston against the spring force in the 
end position. 

The latch mechanism does not engage yet. The hydraulic pressure accumulator is fully charged in this 
end position.

4.6.4. Locking 

When the engine is switched off (while the hydraulic pressure accumulator is charged) the transmis¬ 
sion oil pressure drops causing the spring to be released slightly. This allows the piston to slide into 
the locked position where locking bails hold the piston mechanically in place. 

The now energized solenoid holds the inner slide in place so that the locking balls cannot enter the 
channels designated for releasing the lock. The electric power used for this is low (< 10 W) and is only 
required while the engine is off. Therefor the additional energy consumption of the hydraulic pressure 
accumulator viewed over an entire driving cycle is very low.

4.6.5. Discharging 

When the engine is started, as the driver wants to drive off, the gearshift elements in the automatic 
transmission for driving off must be engaged. The hydraulic pressure accumulator supplies the trans¬ 
mission fluid pressure required for this during the discharging process. 

As the solenoid is deactivated for discharging the inner slide (driven by a small spring) moves in the di¬ 
rection of the locking balls. This allows the balls to enter the channels designated for releasing the lock 
which in turn releases the piston. The spring (compressed during the charging process) exerts force 
on the piston which pressurizes the transmission fluid in the cylinder.

3 

Transmission fluid flows from the hydraulic pressure accumulator back into the 
hydraulic system of the automatic transmission 


The piston moves (in the graphic to the left) and thereby pushes the transmission fluid back into the 
transmission hydraulic system. The transmission fluid exits the cylinder through the now opened non¬ 
return valve and throttle. 

The oil volume forced back into the hydraulic system of the transmission is sufficient to engage the 
gearshift elements needed for the driving off process. This system is designed to provide the initial flu¬ 
id pressure needed for the transmission to go into “Gear” at the exact moment just before the engine 
is started. As soon as the engine is started, the transmission fluid pressure is then again generated by 
the transmission oil pump and the entire process is restarted.

The I transmission is a 6-speed manual gearbox with two-piece die-cast aluminium housing. The dif¬ 
ferent engine applications can be covered with a variation of the clutch housing. The main housing is 
the same for all variants. 

For the I Turbo transmission, the transmission ratio was adapted to the power characteristics of the 
turbo engines. In the F30 the I Turbo transmission is used. 1-350 turbo transmission in the BMW 328i

F30 Powertrain 

5. Manual Gearboxes 


Gears 

To minimize the gearbox noise the running gears have been designed as high gears with a particularly 
large helix angle and have been optimized in terms of their coverage. 

Bearings 

The main bearings have a fundamental influence on the operational smoothness and the switching 
precision of the transmission. Play changes due to temperature fluctuations or an increase in the play 
during operating time are avoided by the exclusive use of grooved ball bearings and roller bearings. 

The main bearings are designed as so-called "clean bearings". They are protected against dirt with a 
cover and are thus oil-permeable. The operating safety is therefore increased and the use of smaller, 
lighter bearings is possible. 

Lubrication 

The use of a life-time oil filling (capacity 1.4 liter). Together with the dirt-resistance of the bearings, an 
optimal combination of a long service life with no maintenance is achieved. 

Synchronization 

In the first and second gear double taper synchronizations are used. All other gears are designed as 
single taper synchronization. 

Acoustics 

A very precise and smooth gearshift is achieved by: 

• The shift gate installed in the transmission 

• The low-friction gearshift shaft in a ball sleeve 

• The use of gearshift forks. 

The passive lock guarantees locking safety with optimized ease of movement.

The K transmission is a 6-gear inline manual gearbox in a countershaft design. 

Instead of the G gearbox, the smaller, lighter and more cost-effective gearbox can be used in the 
N55B30M0 engine. The weight advantage is approx. 11 kg depending on the engine application. 
The gearbox's high transmission capability with at the same time small size and weight is essentially 
achieved by intermediate mounting of the main shafts and a modified gear train concept.

F30 Powertrain 

5. Manual Gearboxes 

5.4.1. Special features 

• Six-speed gearbox with optimized transmission ratios 

• Intermediate bearings 

• Dry-sump lubrication 

• Reduction in consumption (approx. -2% compared to G manual gearboxes) 

• Reduced weight (approx. -11 kg compared to G manual gearboxes) 

• Synchromesh units with carbon friction linings 

• Life-time oil filling 

• Zero-gear sensor for automatic engine start-stop function. 

The gearshift quality is significantly improved by 

• The use of a newly developed carbon friction lining on the synchromesh units 

• Newly developed and very low-friction shift mechanism 

• The low drag losses of the gear train 

• The minimal overshift travel. 

To keep the drag losses low, dry-sump lubrication is used for the first time. Compared with conven¬ 
tional immersion lubrication, this prevents the swash losses from the movement of the gear train in the 
sump oil. Further reduction of losses is achieved by the friction-optimized radial shaft seals.

5. Manual Gearboxes 

5.4.3. Intermediate bearings 

In countershaft-design manual gearboxes the main shaft is pressed away from the countershaft by the 
gearing forces. This gives rise to a deviation of the ideal gearing contact pattern, which results in a sig¬ 
nificant deterioration in the strength of the gearing and the acoustics. 

The K gearbox therefore makes use of intermediate bearings which significantly limit shaft bending. In 
this way, compared with conventional gearboxes, higher torques can be transmitted and the gearing 
acoustics can be simultaneously improved. 

5.4.4. Dry-sump lubrication 

The lubrication method used in conventional manual gearboxes is usually immersion lubrication. The 
gear wheels on the countershaft are immersed into the gearbox oil and distribute it as the gear train 
rotates in an uncontrolled fashion through the entire gearbox. Additional equipment such as oil bulk¬ 
heads or oil ways is often required to deliver the oil to the gearing, the bearings or the synchromesh 
units. 

The K gearbox uses for the first time a dry-sump lubrication system, consisting of 

• Oil filter 

• Oil pump 

• Injection pipe. 

This system utilizes less energy than an immersion lubrication system to deliver lubricating oil specif¬ 
ically to the gearing, the bearings and the synchromesh units. Controlled oil routing also results in im¬ 
proved temperature management, in that cooling air from the underbody area is specifically directed 
into the area of the filter intake opening. In this way, the gearbox oil is subjected to continuous cooling. 

The oil filter also improves the oil quality and with it the load capability of the gearing. 

5.4.5. Synchromesh 

Triple-band synchromesh units are used in 1st and 2nd gears. Single-band synchromesh units are in¬ 
stalled in the other gears. These are equipped with a newly developed carbon friction lining for improv¬ 
ing gearshift quality. 


5.4.6. Mating dimensions 

The mating dimensions for the gearbox mounting have been adopted from established series appli¬ 
cations. In this way, integration in the vehicle environment has been significantly simplified, since it is 
possible to fall back on existing peripherals.

6. Automatic Transmission 


The F30 is available in all engine versions also with automatic transmission. The established GA8HP 
8-speed automatic transmission is always used. 


6.1. Designation 

A unique designation is used for the transmission in the technical documentation so it can be clearly 
identified. In frequent cases, however, only a short designation is used. This short form is used so the 
transmission can be assigned to a transmission family. The GA8HP transmission family, consisting of 
the GA8HP45Z, the GA8HP70Z and the GA8HP90Z transmissions for example, are often mentioned.

7. Rear Axle Differential 


The rear axle differential for the F30 is a further development of the low-friction rear axle differential al¬ 
ready familiar from the E90 and F25. 

For a description of the rear axle differential, please refer to the following Training Manuals: 

• "E90 Complete Vehicle Powertrain" for the rear axle differential HAG 168L 

• "F25 Powertrain Complete Vehicle" for the rear axle differential HAG 188LW and the rear axle 
differential HAG 215 LW.

8. Shafts 

8.1. Drive shafts 

A variant of the drive shaft that is adapted to the torque requests is available for each engine-gearbox 
configuration. 

Focal points in the design of the drive shafts in the were the torque transfer and comfort requirements 
with regard to acoustics and vibrations. 

The joints, shaft divisions and shaft diameters have been designed to prevent disruptive noises or vi¬ 
brations being passed on to the connection points at the body. 

To minimize the high-frequency tooth meshing noise of the rear axle differential, the drive shaft for en¬ 
gines with a torque of over 270 Nm are secured to the rear axle differential with flexible discs. The drive 
shaft is always secured to the gearbox or automatic transmission using flexible discs. 

Depending on the engine/gearbox configuration the steel drive shaft is available in different lengths. It 
is screwed to the gearbox or automatic transmission, connected to the rear axle differential.

8.1.2. Crash function 

In the event of a head-on collision, the drive shaft absorbs a portion of the crash energy. The occupant 
load is thus reduced and the passive safety increased. 

The crash function integrated in the front drive shaft pipe has been optimized. The spring force at 
which the front drive shaft tube selectively deforms has once again been reduced. The torque transfer 
capability has remained unchanged. 


8.2. Rear axle output shafts 

The output shafts for the F30 are designed as a full-length shafts and have different overall lengths on 
account of the rear axle differential being positioned on the left and right sides. The joints to the rear 
axle differential and on the wheel side are designed as journals and are mounted by connection.
