Power supply 


The CID in the F30 is not connected to a bus. The CID is directly connected to the headunit via an 
APIX interface. APIX (Automotive Pixel Link) is a bit-serial data transfer system with a data transfer rate 
of 1 Gbit/s on just one copper core pair. Each APIX video link also has a bidirectional reverse channel. 
Data transfer via the APIX interface has been optimized with regard to electromagnetic compatibility 
and power consumption. 

Because of the CID's low power consumption, the CID can be supplied with power via 2 separate cur¬ 
rent leads directly by the headunit, and there is no need for a separate power supply to the CID. Be¬ 
cause of the high data transfer rate with low electromagnetic emissions, it is also possible to use cop¬ 
per wiring for applications with a high bandwidth requirement and to dispense with fiber optic net¬ 
working. 

The CID is connected via two APIX links to the headunit. The two copper core pairs and the two pow¬ 
er supply leads are connected by a common connector to the headunit and the CID. An APIX video link 
serves to transfer the screen content to the CID. The bidirectional reverse channels of the APIX video 
links serve to transfer status information (such as e.g. CID operating temperature), diagnostic informa¬ 
tion and control signals.

2. Radio and Headunits 


In the radio systems area, in addition to an AM/FM double tuner, are integrated in the Basic headunit. 

In conjunction with the Basic headunit, phase diversity is used instead of the previously customary an¬ 
tenna diversity for FM radio reception. For further information on phase diversity, please refer to the 
chapter entitled antenna Systems. 

In the F30 the Basic headunit has - in conjunction with a mobile phone preparation with connection for 
Bluetooth and USB devices (option 6NL) - a voice recognition system. 

The Telephone function is realized in the headunit and the Contact information is stored on internal 
memory as there is no removable SD Card. 



Index Explanation 



The Basic headunit does not contain any components that are replaceable by a BMW Service agent 
and has to be replaced completely if defective. The Ethernet connection from the FEM to the headunit 
is used solely to update the headunit's software.

Controller 


The CIC headunit was installed for the first time in 2008 in the BMW 1 and 3 Series vehicles in con¬ 
junction with the Navigation system (option 609). This is now also used in the F30. 

The CID in the F30 is not connected to a bus. The CID is, as with the Basic headunit, directly connect¬ 
ed to the headunit via an APIX interface. The CID can be supplied with power via two leads directly by 
the headunit. 

In the F30 the CIC always has a voice recognition system. To be able to operate the voice recognition 
system with the buttons on the steering wheel, it is necessary for the Multifunction for steering wheel 
to be installed as standard. 

The headunit provides, through data management on an 80 GB hard disk, for a multitude of new possi¬ 
bilities.

This is clearly shown in the audio field particularly with the compiling of music. Music files can be con¬ 
verted (ripped) or copied for compiling music on the hard disc. Stored on the CIC-dedicated hard disk, 
fast access to these music files is ensured at all times. A choice of up to 3700 music files (12 GB) is 
possible here.

3. Speaker Systems 

3.1. Overview 

The speaker systems in the F30 are available in three specification levels: 

• HiFi system = HiFi loudspeaker system 

• Top HiFi system = HiFi loudspeaker system Harman Kardon (optional equipment 688). 

This means the HiFi system is standard equipment. 

The speaker and amplifier from the F30 have a similar design to the systems currently used in the 5- 
Series and 7-Series. The amplifier and headunits have been optimally adapted to the passenger com¬ 
partment of the F30 through vehicle-specific equalizing. 

The two central basses, like in all the current BMW vehicles, are positioned under the front seats, 
whereby a consistent bass reproduction is possible in the entire vehicle. The necessary housing vol¬ 
ume is achieved by connecting the central basses to the side sill. 

All systems have an adjustable, speed-dependent volume adjustment, whereby the higher driving 
noise level is compensated at higher driving speeds. 


3.2. Components 


3.2.1. HiFi system 

The HiFi loudspeaker system consists of nine speakers. A seven-channel amplifier is integrated in the 
HiFi loudspeaker system. The amplifier of the HiFi system has no bus connection and receives the 
switch-on signal instead via a separate line. 

Separate speakers are installed in the HiFi system for the treble and mid-tone ranges. 

The HiFi system also has a significantly louder center bass speaker and a mid-range speaker posi¬ 
tioned centrally in the instrument cluster as a center speaker. 

The speakers and the amplifier of the HiFi system are illustrated in the following graphic. The speakers 
are operated with a power output of 5 x 25 watts for the mid-range speakers and tweeters and 2 x 40 
watts for the bass speakers.

3.2.2. Top HiFi system 



F30 tweeter, exterior mirror cover 

The Harman Kardon HiFi loudspeaker system (optional equipment 688), which has been further opti¬ 
mized in comparison to the HiFi loudspeaker system, is complemented with two additional mid-range 
speakers and five additional tweeters. The Top HiFi system thus comprises a total of 16 speakers. In¬ 
corporated in the Top HiFi system is a nine-channel amplifier with digital equalizing. The AMPT of the 
Top HiFi system is a bus user in Media Oriented System Transport (MOST). 

The mid-range speakers and tweeters of the Top HiFi system have high-quality aluminium diaphragms 
for a clearly differentiated acoustic pattern. Thanks to the additional use of hexagonally structured 
metal covers the damping and resonances of the covers are minimized. 

The high-quality panels with lettering, which are made from anodized aluminium, in the mirror triangles 
are a notable visible difference. 

The amplifier of the Top HiFi system is equipped with a so-called load logic separator in the F30. Here 
the amplifier electronics are supplied and connected with a separate voltage line. This is specially pro¬ 
tected against brief voltage dips which in turn prevents failure of the electronics if a voltage dip occurs 
briefly. 

The speakers and the amplifier of the Top HiFi system are illustrated in the following graphic. The 
speakers are operated with a power output of 7 x 50 watts for the mid-range speakers and tweeters 
and 2x125 watts for the bass speakers.

4. Telephone Systems 


4.3.1. Compatibility 

The range and diversity of mobile phones available on the market is steadily increasing. Not every 
Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone is automatically compatible with a hands-free system. The Internet 
site http://www.bmwusa.com/bluetooth has been completely revised to enable the customer to make 
as easy and clear an enquiry as possible. 

The customer can now obtain information regarding the compatibility of specific mobile phones with 
his vehicle (by entering the vehicle identification number for example). A prospective BMW customer 
can also find out which mobile phones are compatible with specific BMW models. 



4.4. Hands-free system with USB interface 

A telephone-supported headunit is used in conjunction with radio (standard equipment) in the F30. 
With this, no additional control unit is required in order to provide telephone functions in the vehicle. 

In vehicles with Navigation System (option 609) a Combox is installed as well as the headunit to 
achieve the telephone function. In this case, the microphone, the Bluetooth antenna and the AUX-ln 
connection with USB audio interface are connected not to the headunit, but to the Combox. 

The functionality and operation of the telephone function follow the established BMW logic. Business 
Connectivity can be used to pair a wide range of mobile phones via Bluetooth. A list of compatible de¬ 
vices is available at http://www.bmwusa.com/bluetooth. 

The phone book and lists of callers are transferred from the mobile phone. Contacts can be stored in 
the address memory of the headunit in addition to the mobile phone's phone book. 

During the call the telephone function allows calls to be held or extended (conference call), DTMF 
tones to be transmitted, and the microphone to be muted. 

4.4.1. System wiring diagram 

The system wiring diagram for Business Connectivity in conjunction with Navigation System (option 
609) is depicted in the system wiring diagram in the section entitled Car Information Computer (CIC).

7. Personal Profile 


Personal Profile stores personally input data, such as e.g. the automatic setting of the exterior mirrors 
or the speed-dependent volume, in the corresponding control units. 



Personal Profile operating principle 


Index Explanation 



There is a total of four profiles in the vehicle. Three of these can be adapted for different persons and 
assigned to different ID transmitters. Once the vehicle is unlocked via the ID transmitter, the system 
recognizes the profile assigned to the ID transmitter and activates it. 


A guest profile can be activated in addition to the three profiles which can be assigned to ID transmit¬ 
ters. The guest profile can be used to make individual settings without affecting the three personal 
profiles. The guest profile can be activated in the Settings menu in the CID.

7. Personal Profile 


A 


Information for Service: 



When receiving a vehicle with Personal Profile, it is important to ensure that the guest profile is activat¬ 
ed. In this way, the settings made by the vehicle user are not altered. 

Profiles can be imported and exported by means of the USB interface or BMW Online. Which USB port 
can be used to import and export the profiles is dependent on the vehicle's equipment specification: 

Optional equipment 

In conjunction with 

USB port 

Navigation System 
(option 609) 

- 

Glove box 

Radio (standard) 

Hands-free system with USB inter¬ 
face (option 6NH) 

Center console 

Radio (standard) 

Mobile phone preparation with con¬ 
nection for Bluetooth and USB de¬ 
vices (option 6NL) 

No import/export via 

USB possible 


Personal profile is always stored in the headunit. Vehicles with navigation (option 609) have a USB port 
in the glovebox to perform import/export of data. 

With the standard radio in combination with the Hands-free system with USB interface (option 6NH), 
personal profile can be imported/exported through the USB connection in the center console because 
this is connected to the headunit. 

With the standard radio in combination with the Mobile phone preparation with connection for Blue¬ 
tooth and USB devices (option 6NL) it is not possible to import/export through the USB connection in 
the center console because this is connected to the Combox and not the headunit. 


Exported profiles can also be imported to other vehicles. Which settings of the profiles are adopted 
during import to another vehicle is dependent on the vehicle model and its equipment specification. 
During import only settings of functions which are identical in both vehicles are adopted. If a setting 
cannot be imported, the current setting of the existing profile is retained.

Map updating for navigation is performed in the F30 via a USB interface which is connected to the 
headunit. The USB port in glove box must be used for map updating. In vehicles with the USB port in 
the center console, this cannot be used for map updating since the USB is connected to the COM-

Digital signal processor (DSP) 


Vehicles with Navigation (option 609) are equipped with antenna diversity. The antenna diversity 
boosts the signals of the two FM antennas and evaluates the signal levels of the two radio signals. 

The antenna with the better input signal is used for radio reception. The system switches to the other 
FM antenna if the signal quality of the received radio station is inadequate in terms of quality and field 
strength. The switch-on signal for the antenna diversity and the power supply is made available to the 
antenna diversity via the interference suppression filter of the additional brake light. 

Vehicles with the standard radio equipment are equipped with phase diversity. The radio signals of the 
two FM antennas are boosted in the phase diversity module and transmitted to the Basic headunit. 
The radio signals are digitized in the Basic headunit. An improved signal is then calculated from the 
two radio signals with the aid of an algorithm in a digital signal processor (DSP). The switch-on signal

F30 Entertainment and Communication 

9. Antenna Systems 

for the phase diversity and the power supply is made available by the headunit. For updating the list 
of stations only the signal from one antenna is used briefly for radio reception and the signal from the 
other antenna is used for scanning the frequencies. The interval for updating the list of stations de¬ 
pends on the signal quality of the stronger antenna, but occurs at the latest every four minutes. 


9.2. Bluetooth Antenna 

The Bluetooth antenna for the F30 is conceived as an open item and supplied as part of the wiring har¬ 
ness. A non-connected antenna can no longer be identified by this design. In vehicles which do not 
have a Combox the Bluetooth antenna is located under the center console. In vehicles which do have a 
Combox the Bluetooth antenna is located in the area of the left C-pillar
