2.1. Instrument cluster 

The central display unit with speedometer, rev counter, fuel gauge, engine oil temperature, and indica¬ 
tor and warning lights is referred to as the instrument cluster. 

The instrument cluster receives information on the wiring harness in the form of analogue and digital 
electrical signals. These signals are processed and then displayed in the instrument cluster, or passed 
on as information to other control units. 

Depending on the equipment, two different instrument cluster versions are used in the F30. 

As a control unit, the basic version of the instrument cluster is a bus user on the PT-CAN. 

As a control unit, the high version of the instrument cluster is a bus user on the MOST bus and on the 
PT-CAN.

TFT display 


The basic instrument cluster in the F30 has five analogue instrument dials in four tubes. The basic ver¬ 
sion of the instrument cluster incorporates a TFT display with a resolution of 320 x 120 pixels at the 
bottom between the round instruments. It has a screen diagonal of 2.7“. 

The basic instrument cluster is installed in the F30 for vehicles without Professional navigation system 
(optional equipment 609), without Lane departure warning (optional equipment 5AD), without Head- 
Up Display (optional equipment 610), and without speed limit information (optional equipment 8TH). 

The two large round instruments show the road speed and engine speed. The indication of the status 
of the automatic engine start-stop function (MSA) (READY/OFF) is integrated in the rev counter. The 
current fuel consumption is displayed at the bottom of the rev counter. 

The two small round instruments on the left- and right-hand side show the fuel tank capacity and en¬ 
gine oil temperature respectively.

TFT display 


The instrument cluster high-version has been designed for the F30 and has four analogue instrument 
dials in four tubes. Each of the scales in the instrument cluster is specific to the country, vehicle and 
engine. 

The two large round instruments show the road speed and engine speed. The indication of the status 
of the automatic engine start-stop function (MSA) (READY/OFF) is integrated in the rev counter. The 
current consumption is shown on the display under the rev counter and the energy recovery is shown 
in the coasting (overrun) mode. 

The two small round instruments on the left- and right-hand side show the fuel tank capacity and en¬ 
gine oil temperature respectively. 

The high version of the instrument cluster is available as the optional equipment instrument cluster 
with extended functional scope (optional equipment 6WA). The high version of the instrument cluster 
incorporates a TFT display with a resolution of 640 x 160 pixels below the round instruments. Its diag¬ 
onal screen size is 5.7“. 

The high version of the instrument cluster is required for some items of optional equipment. This in¬ 
cludes the Professional navigation system (optional equipment 609), the Lane departure warning (op¬ 
tional equipment 5AD), the Head-Up Display (optional equipment 610) and the speed limit information 
(optional equipment 8TH). A variant of the instrument cluster is used in connection with the Head-Up 
Display and has an APIX interface.

2.2. Central Information Display 

Depending on the equipment installed, two different versions of a freestanding Central Information 
Display (CID) are installed in the F30.. 

The Central Information Display (CID) in the F30 no longer has a bus connection. The CID is direct¬ 
ly connected to the headunit via an APIX interface. APIX (Automotive Pixel Link) is a bit-serial 1 Gbit/s 
video link with just one copper core pair. The CID is connected by 2 APIX video links to the headunit. 
The APIX link is an EMC-optimized physical layer for real time video transfer via copper cables. The 
CID can be supplied with power via two leads directly by the headunit. 

As with all new BMW models, the system is operated by means of the central operating element, the 
controller. 

The Central Information Display is an integrated display and operating facility for the following func¬ 
tions: 

• Audio functions, such as radio, CD, MP3 

• Telephone 

• Navigation 

• On-board computer, journey computer 

• Vehicle information, Interactive Owner's Handbook IBA 

• Vehicle settings 

• Vehicle functions, such as PDC for example 

• BMW Services. 


2.2.1. CID with 6.5“ screen diagonal 

A CID with 6.5" screen diagonal is installed in conjunction with out navigation. The display resolution is 
800 x 480 pixels. 

A CID with a black high-gloss clasp is used in vehicles with BMW Professional radio (standard equip¬ 
ment).

2.2.2. CID with 8.8“ screen diagonal 

A CID with 8.8“ screen diagonal is installed in conjunction with the Professional navigation system (op¬ 
tion 609). The display resolution is 1280 x 480 pixels. The CID with 8.8“ screen diagonal also has a 
cover made from anti-reflecting laminated safety glass which stretches to the edge of the CID.

2.3. Head-Up Display 

The name "Head-Up" describes the principle benefit of this system. The Head-Up Display (HUD) 
projects a virtual image into the driver's field of view. Important information, e.g. from the cruise control 
or navigation system with activated arrow display, is reflected on the windscreen and is therefore per¬ 
manently available in the driver's field of view. 

The Head-Up Display (optional equipment 610) in the F30 contains various functions aimed at en¬ 
hancing road safety and ride comfort. This includes display of: 

• Speed 

• Speed setting control of DCC 

• Collision warning 

• Navigation system 

• Check Control messages 

• Speed limit information 

• Lane departure warning. 

• Entertainment lists. 

The HUD used in the F30 has been developed further to include the following functions: 

• Intersection view 

• Road symbol in the junction view. 

The HUD in the F30 can now also project the color blue, in addition to red and green. Contents can be 
displayed in all colors of the RGB color spectrum, as is the case with an LCD monitor, by mixing the 
three colors. 

Having the displays in the driver's direct field of view increases safety, as this allows the driver to keep 
his eyes on the road at all times.

The driver can use the driving experience switch to select different programs which alter various prop¬ 
erties of the vehicle depending on the vehicle's equipment specification. The following programs are 
available: 

• SPORT+ (only in vehicles with sport automatic transmission option 2TB, variable sport steer¬ 
ing option 2VL or Sport Line PA 7AC) 

• SPORT 

• COMFORT 

• ECO PRO. 

When the driver switches to a different program, the selected program is displayed in the instrument 
cluster. In vehicles with CID a pop-up also appears for the selected program.

ECO PRO mode 

The ECO PRO mode supports the driver in adopting an optimized-consumption driving style and re¬ 
duces fuel consumption through intelligent control of energy and A/C management. Essentially the 
following measures help to reduce fuel consumption: 

• The driver is supported in adopting an optimized-consumption driving style by means of an 
alteration of the accelerator pedal characteristic and the shift program in automatic transmis¬ 
sions or the shift point indicator in manual gearboxes. 

• The A/C system is placed in the ECO PRO operating state. Here the A/C system operates at 
reduced air drying and cooling. If the required temperature can be achieved without cold pro¬ 
duction, the A/C compressor is switched off. During heating mode the engine operating mode 
with increased heat dissipation is to the greatest possible extent dispensed.

F30 Displays, Indicators and Controls 

2. System Components 

The ECO PRO operating condition of the heating/air-conditioning unit can be reset by the driv¬ 
er in the COMFORT operating condition. The setting of the operating state of the heating and 
A/C system is stored and re-established when the ECO PRO mode is called up again. 

• The exterior mirror heating is switched off and the seat heating temperature is limited to 37.5 
°C instead of 42 °C. These measures are allied to the ECO PRO operating state of the heating 
and A/C program. 

• The driver is prompted by various displays to adopt an optimized-consumption driving style 
and is supported in optimizing their driving style.

Display of the bonus range 


The bonus range is the actual additional range which was achieved through your ECO PRO driving 
style. The bonus range is calculated in the BC according to the personal driving style and the resulting 
consumption. The BC gets to know the personal long-term consumption of the driver. To determine 
the range the current consumption in ECO PRO mode is compared to your 'learnt' consumption in the 
instrument cluster outside of the ECO PRO mode. This creates a difference in liters which is recalcu¬ 
lated into the bonus range.

Upon activation of the ECO PRO mode the automatic engine start-stop function is automatically 
switched on.
