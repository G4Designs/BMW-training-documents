FlexRay is used in the F30 as the system bus for networking of the systems that control the dynam¬ 
ic handling characteristics and engine control. A so-called star coupler with four bus drivers is located 
in the central gateway module (ZGM), which is integrated in the new Front Electronic Module (FEM). 
The bus drivers forward the data of the control units via the communication controller to the ZGM. The 
FlexRay control units are connected to these bus drivers. 

Terminating resistors are used on both ends of the data lines to avoid reflections on the lines. 

The body controller area network 2 (K-GAN2) facilitates communication between control units with 
a high data transfer rate (500 kBit/s). The K-GAN2 is also connected to the other bus systems via the 
central gateway module (ZGM). 

The powertrain controller area network 2 (PT-GAN2) creates a redundancy to the powertrain controller 
area network (PT-GAN) in the area of engine and transmission control. 

The F30 has Ethernet access in order to be able to program the complete vehicle quickly. Due to the 
very high data transfer rate of the Ethernet (100 MBit/s), the programming access via the MOST sys¬ 
tem could be discontinued. The headunit also obtains an Ethernet connection, via which the program¬ 
ming for MOST devices is effected. 

The FEM/ZGM assumes the task in the F30 of distributing the telegrams internally within the vehicle 
to the buses and of forwarding to the headunit via K-GAN2. The headunit then provides for distribution 
on the MOST. 

The navigation data of the GIG High (Navigation Professional option 609) are stored on its hard disk. 
These navigation data are updated via the Ethernet access at the OBD II connection and the internal 
vehicle Ethernet connection between ZGM and GIG. 

The D-GAN at the OBD II connection is used in the dealer organization to program vehicles at "autho¬ 
rized third parties". Legal provisions stipulate that all control units must be able to be programmed via 
the D-GAN. HDD update is an exception. 


2.3. OBD II diagnostic access 

The diagnostic socket is situated as in other BMW vehicles on the left A-pillar. Both vehicle diagnosis 
via the D-GAN and programming access via the Ethernet to the vehicle are made available via the OBD 
II interface.

• Battery 

• Intelligent battery sensor (IBS) 

• Safety battery terminal (SBK) 

• Power Distribution Module (PDM) 

• Power distribution box, front, with B+ jump start terminal point

3.2.2. Wiring harness 

There is an increasing use of aluminium lines for the voltage supply in the F30. Lower weight and low¬ 
er costs are the reason for the increased use of aluminium. The B+ underfloor cable made from solid 
aluminium with a flat 59 mm^ profile section runs from the B+ transfer terminal point (rear) to the B+ 
jump start terminal point (front). 

Connectors with a secondary lock (CPA, Connector Position Assurance) are used at both the engine 
compartment power distribution box and the luggage compartment power distribution box. This pro¬ 
vides for significantly more reliable contacting. Thinner cables with a cross-section of just 0.22 mm^ 
are used in the F30. 

The following tables shows the distribution of copper and aluminium cables in the vehicle:

The cross-section of the line from the power distribution box at the front to the EPS and the ground 
line EPS depends on the steering of the vehicle: 

• 27 mm^ aluminium lines for EPS High (for BMW 328i and 335i) or for EPS+ (for vehicles with 

variable sport steering (option 2VL). 

For more information on the Electronic Power Steering EPS, please refer to the training information 
“F30 Chassis and Suspension". 


3.2.3. Power distribution boxes 

Two separate power distribution boxes - adapted to the FEM/REM concept - are installed. The engine 
compartment power distribution box is located on the right side of the engine compartment directly 
on the front bulkhead. The battery power distribution box is no longer located at the battery, but is se¬ 
cured in front of the battery at the wheel arch. 

A few functions where load relays are integrated in the FEM/REM are fuse-protected directly in the 
FEM or REM. This also applies to the terminal 30F controlled exclusively by the FEM.

3.3. Stabilization of the vehicle electrical system 

In vehicles equipped with the automatic engine start-stop function (MSA), starting operations, and 
therefore voltage dips in the vehicle electrical system, occur more frequently. A DC/DC converter is in¬ 
stalled in these vehicles, depending on the vehicle equipment specification, to protect specific volt¬ 
age-sensitive electrical components. 

The DC/DC converter supplies a constant voltage to terminals 30B_DC/DC, also during the starting 
operation. 

One DC/DC converter is installed in conjunction with one of the following items of optional equipment: 

• Navigation system Professional (optional extra 609) 

• Harman Kardon Surround Sound System (option 688). 


3.4. Energy management 

The energy management of the F30 has been extended to include the functions already added in the 
F25. 


3.4.1. Charge state indicator 

If the F30 is in transport mode, the battery's state of charge is continuously displayed when in opera¬ 
tion. The carrier can therefore charge the battery on time in order to prevent deep discharging of the 
battery, and therefore damage to the battery. Before the vehicle is handed over, the dealer can check 
whether the battery is sufficiently charged or whether it needs to be replaced. 

3.4.2. Influence of steering power 

The power consumption of the electronic power steering (electromechanical power steering) EPS is 
extremely high. In order to avoid a brief reduction in the steering servo availability, the energy manage¬ 
ment of the F30 anticipates and responds to steering-intensive driving manoeuvres (parking or three- 
point turns). To do this, specific input variables (e.g. driving speed, brake pedal operation and steering 
angle) are evaluated. The energy management can implement the following measures: 

• Raise the idling speed and adjust the ignition timing to increase the engine torque 

• Increase the vehicle voltage via the alternator 

• Turn off convenience functions (heated rear window, outside mirror heating system and seat 
heating). 


3.4.3. Power distribution box, front 

A condenser is installed in the front power distribution box to reduce the harmonic content in the vehi¬ 
cle voltage caused by the alternator. 

If a faulty electric fan is replaced, the harmonic content of the voltage must also be measured. If the 
harmonic content is too high, this indicates that a condenser is faulty and must be replaced.

3.5. Supply to EPS 

The F30 is equipped as standard with electromechanical power steering (EPS) with servotronic or vari¬ 
able sport steering (option 2VL) which can be ordered as optional equipment. 

The EPS makes possible a reduction of the average fuel consumption by approx. 3 % in comparison to 
conventional hydraulic steering. This helps reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

3.6. Battery Guard 

The Battery Guard function detects critical states of charge which could jeopardize engine starting 
and sends this relevant information directly to the BMW Service authorized workshop. The customer is 
then notified by BMW Service department (via phone or email) of the required service. 

The optional equipment BMW Assist with enhanced Bluetooth and USB (option 6NL) and an active 
BMW ConnectedDrive agreement are required for the Battery Guard function. 

The BMW TeleServices Battery Guard Gall is automatically activated by the vehicle under the following 
conditions: 

• If the battery voltage reaches the bottom of the starting ability limit because a bus wake-up 
signal is present, sleep mode is prevented or there is a standby current violation the BMW 
TeleServices Battery Guard informs the BMW Service authorized workshop in defined cases 
at the next vehicle start-up (terminal 15 active). It can then proactively contact the customer 
and arrange a service appointment to eliminate the cause. This function is available for the se¬ 
ries launch of the F30 in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, the USA and Ganada.

4.1. Central gateway module (ZGM) 

The task of the ZGM is to connect all the data bus systems to each other. By connecting them in this 
way, it is possible to use information from the individual bus systems on a generalized level. The ZGM 
is able to implement different protocols and speeds on other bus systems. The programming data are 
transmitted by Ethernet to the vehicle via the ZGM. 

The ZGM is integrated as a module in the FEM in the electrical system architecture 2020. It is viewed 
as a control unit within a control unit. 

The ZGM has its own complete software unit, comprising bootloader and application, and its own di¬ 
agnosis address. The ZGM is not codable. The bootloader and the application software can be flashed 
independently of the FEM. 


4.2. Control unit replacement 

A counter exchange with control units from other vehicles is not possible. A control unit can only be or¬ 
dered as a spare part. It is important to bear in mind in this respect that the FEM and the DME are sup¬ 
plied already coded to the vehicle. The advantage of this is that only the control unit is replaced and 
there is no need to adjust the electronic immobilizer. 

In contrast, an adjustment must be made to the electronic transmission control after the control unit 
is replaced. In the course of this adjustment the FEM transmits the individual code to the electronic 
transmission control unit.

6. CAS Functions 


There are two distinct systems concerned with vehicle access: 

• Basic access, central locking system 

• Comfort Access (option 322). 

The entire access control of the previous CAS control unit is integrated entirely in the FEM. Mechani¬ 
cal access to the vehicle is confined to opening the driver's door lock. Complete locking of the vehicle 
is thus not possible (except with option 302 Alarm system).

standard. This function is called "Passive Go" (drive authorization). However, to gain access to the ve¬ 
hicle, it is still necessary to actuate the ID transmitter. 

The following CAS functions are integrated in the F30: 

• Comfort Access 

The optional equipment Comfort Access contains the "Comfort Entry" and "Comfort Exit" 
functions. The "Passive Go" function comes as standard. 

• Central locking system 

• Power window regulators 

• Slide/tilt sunroof 

• Terminal control 

• Electronic immobilizer. 

Further CAS functions are among others: 

• Vehicle data storage 

• Data transfer for Condition Based Service (CBS). 

The CAS functions correspond to those in the F01 and are described in the "Car Access System F01/ 
F02" training information. 

With regard to start enable by the electronic immobilizer (also called Challenge Response), some 
changes have been made from the F01. What is new is the omission of the CAS bus, because PT-CAN 
and FlexRay already provide redundancy of data transfer between FEM and DME. 

The emergency-start function (stopping the ID transmitter at the ring antenna on the steering column) 
is already known from the F01.

The two sensors are connected to the evaluation electronics and constantly measure the capacity. A 
comparison of the time characteristic of the measured capacities permits the identification of a certain 
movement pattern. 

A targeted foot movement to and from the bumper can be detected herefrom. The top sensor detects 
the shin, the bottom sensor the toes. 

The detection range is between the rear lights. 

The sensors are secured in the inside of the rear bumper. 

The trunk opens regardless if it was locked or unlocked.

8. Central Locking System 


Index Explanation 



The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the remote control receiver. 

After the remote control receiver has verified the signal, it forwards it to the Front Electronic Module 
FEM. The signal causes the FEM to activate the central locking system and the interior lighting. 

The FEM evaluates the status of all door contacts. In this way, for example, the vehicle can be prevent¬ 
ed from being locked while the driver's door is open. 

The status of the central locking system button/hazard warning switch is also evaluated by the FEM. 
The FEM activates the central locking system, depending on the status. 

The Rear Electronic Module (REM) is responsible for sensing the status and activating the central 
locking system in the trunk. The FEM is responsible for the activation of the fuel filler flap.

The remote control receiver checks the data telegrams of the ID transmitter and transmits them when 
identified correctly via the LIN bus to the FEM. The FEM evaluates the signal and causes the vehicle to 
be unlocked or locked. 

The central locking system functions for the doors and the trunk are controlled by the FEM. The REM 
controls the trunk central locking system. 

The central locking system can be operated from various positions: 

• inside the vehicle 

via the central locking system button on the dashboard 

• outside the vehicle 

via the ID transmitter or 

via the door handle on the driver or front passenger door or 

the trunk pushbutton on the outer trunk, for Comfort Access including Smart Opener (option 
322).

Index Explanation 



The front power window regulators are activated by the FEM. The REM assumes the activation of the 
rear power window regulators. The power window regulators at the front are protected directly via the 
FEM and the power window regulators at the rear are protected directly via the REM. The relevant load 
relays are integrated directly in the FEM/REM. There is therefore no need for power to be supplied via 
a power distribution box. 

The functions with regard to comfort and anti-trap protection are already familiar from the E90.

13. Exterior Lights 

The exterior lights of the F30 are based on the current BMW models. 

The F30 is equipped with halogen headlights as standard. Bi-xenon headlights are available as option¬ 
al equipment (option 522). 

With the optional equipment bi-xenon headlight, LEDs are used for the daytime running lights, side 
lights and positioning lights. 

With halogen headlights, the headlight beam throw is regulated manually. 

Adaptive headlights are available as optional equipment (option 524) for the F30. This is only available 
in conjunction with bi-xenon headlights (option 522). 

The FEM as the master control unit is responsible for the exterior light functions. It decides which 
lighting functions have to be activated or deactivated and makes this information available to the REM 
via the K-CAN2. The REM in turn signals the status of the activated function in each case back to the 
FEM. 

The additional LED turn indicators are in the exterior mirror. The additional turn indicators in the side 
panel are therefore omitted. 

For more information on exterior lights, please refer to the "Exterior Lights F01/F02" training informa¬ 
tion.

13.2. Adaptive headlights 

In the F30 the adaptive headlight (option 524) is only available with the following optional equipment: 

• Rain sensor (option 521) 

• Xenon light (option 522) 

• High-beam assistant (option 5AC). 

The adaptive headlight enables dynamic lighting of the roadway thanks to a variable headlight control 
unit. 

So as not to dazzle oncoming traffic the adaptive headlight is not active when reversing or when steer¬ 
ing in stationary mode to the left (for left-hand drive vehicles).

The high-beam assistant/automatic high-beams (option SAC) is dazzle-free with the adaptive head¬ 
light optional equipment. More information on the dazzle-free high-beam assistants can be found in 
the training information "Driver Assist Systems of the F30". 


13.2.1. Function 

The headlight follows the course of the road depending on the steering angle and other parameters. 

For further information on the adaptive headlight, please refer to the training information "F01 /F02 Ex¬ 
terior Lights". 

13.2.2. Operation 

The adaptive headlight is activated in switch position "A" when the ignition is switched on. 

The cornering light is automatically activated depending on the steering angle or turn indicator. 

13.2.3. Cornering light 

The cornering light function is included in the adaptive headlight optional equipment. At narrow bends 
or when turning, one of the two fog lights is activated as a cornering light up to a speed of 65 km/h. 
This illuminates the inner area of the bend better. So as not to dazzle oncoming traffic, the adaptive 
headlight points to the front passenger side when the vehicle is stationary.

F30 General Vehicle Electronics 
16. Heating/Air Conditioning Systems 

In the F30 an integrated heating and air-conditioning system (IHKA) is used as standard equipment for 
the heating and air-conditioning system. In the E90 an integrated heating / air-conditioning regulation 
(IHKR) was used as standard equipment. 

With an integrated heating / air-conditioning regulation the duct temperature is adjusted to the value 
set using the control panel. In contrast, with an integrated heating / air-conditioning system the interi¬ 
or temperature of the vehicle is also taken into consideration when controlling the duct temperature. If 
the interior temperature deviates greatly from the set temperature, the duct temperature is then con¬ 
trolled at a lower or higher value than the set temperature in order to quickly reach the set temperature. 

The IHKA of the F30 therefore has an additional interior temperature sensor installed in the control 
panel. The sensor data is digitized in the control panel and the information transmitted to the IHKA 
control unit via the local interconnect network bus. Thanks to a computer model integrated in the IH¬ 
KA controls, the forced ventilation of the interior temperature sensor in the F30 could be discontinued. 
The duct temperature is measured using sensors in the ventilation system, which are connected di¬ 
rectly to the IHKA control unit. 

• Integrated automatic heating / air conditioning (IHKA), 2/1 -zone. 

In the zone specification the first number denotes the number of controllable temperature zones (tem¬ 
perature selector wheels) and the second number the number of controllable airflow volume and air 
distribution zones (separate fan settings). 


16.1. Sensors and actuators 

Sensors and actuators which are connected to the FEM control unit are involved in the function of the 
heating and air conditioning system in the F30. The following list provides an overview of these com¬ 
ponents: 

• Refrigerant circuit pressure sensor 

The FEM evaluates the pressure sensor signal and makes it available to the IHKA control unit 
via K-CAN 

• Blower 

The IHKA control unit request is sent via the LIN bus to the blower 

• A/C compressor 

The A/C compressor is controlled via a pulse-width modulated signal by the FEM. The FEM 
can also actuate the A/C compressor clutch. The request is always effected however through 
the IHKA control unit. In the event of a fault, a fault entry is made by the FEM. 

• Heat exchanger water valve 

• Stepper motors 

Nine stepper motors for IHKA 2/1 zones 

• Rear-seat area ventilation sensor 

The FEM evaluates the signal from the rear-seat area ventilation sensor and makes it available 
to the IHKA control unit via the K-CAN.

F30 General Vehicle Electronics 
16. Heating/Air Conditioning Systems 

16.2. Features 

16.2.1. IHKA features 

• Improved protection of the blower motor through closed area of the blower wheel 

Protection of the blower motor against water and contaminants 

• One-piece microfilter on the pressure side of the blower 

Air filtering also in air recirculation function, thus improved air quality 

Reduced build-up of odors, as well as less corrosion on evaporator 

• Separation of IHKA controls and IHKA control unit 

The IHKA control unit is now located at the heating and air-conditioning unit 

Communication between IHKA controls and IHKA control unit by means of local intercon¬ 
nect network bus via the audio control panel 

• Air-conditioning with clutch 

In the case of a switched-off air-conditioning system the compressor is separated from the 
belt drive by a clutch, the load on the engine is therefore less thus saving on fuel 

• ECO PRO function 

Climate control 

Less air-drying and cooling, thus less drive power required for A/C compressor 

A/C compressor is switched off if required temperature is reached also without cold-air 

generation 

Heating mode 

Dispensed with operating mode of combustion engine with increased heat dissipation. 


16.2.2. Additional Functions of the IHKA 

• Operable stratification 

• Air flaps are individually activated using 9 stepper motors 

• Temperature for rear-seat area ventilation can be adjusted 

The FEM evaluates the signal from the rear-seat area ventilation sensor and makes it available 
to the IHKA control unit via the K-CAN.
