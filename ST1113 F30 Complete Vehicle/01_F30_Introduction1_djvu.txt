F30 Introduction 

1. Body 


The sixth edition of the BMW 3-Series will be launched on the market in February 2012. Each gener¬ 
ation of these vehicles combine exceptional sporting character and dynamics, maximum comfort and 
innovation. 

The new BMW 3-Series Sedan also offers a well-balanced harmonious design concept. This sporty 
Sedan with its confident appearance represents the ultimate driving machine, first-class agility and 
driving dynamics without making any compromises elsewhere. 



BMW F30 

The characteristic BMW proportions, the short overhang at the front, the long wheelbase or the ex¬ 
tended engine compartment lid transmit a dynamic image, even when the vehicle is stationary. 

The exceptional efficiency offered by BMW engines was even improved once again in the F30. The 
new engines are characterized by high power and low consumption at the same time. 

For the first time in the BMW 3-Series three different equipment packages are being offered, each 
with their own independent character.

2.1. Introduction 

For the F30, great importance was attached to construction with lightweight materials. This is 
achieved with the targeted application of higher-strength multi-phase steels and super-strength hot- 
formed steels. The F30 sees an increase in the average strength of its body materials of 10% com¬ 
pared with the E90. 

The construction with lightweight materials makes a decisive contribution to reducing the vehicle 
weight. In conjunction with a rigid design of the bodyshell, it makes a significant contribution to

F30 Introduction 

2. Bodyshell 

• Driving dynamics 

• Reduction of the fuel consumption 

• Reducing C0 2 emissions 

• Passive safety. 

Special features 

• High proportion of multi-phase steels (14% of the bodyshell weight) 

• High proportion of hot-formed steels (3% of the bodyshell weight). 

The higher-strength multi-phase steels and super-strength hot-formed steels ensure maximum safety 
of the passenger safety cell with low weight. They therefore make a huge contribution to passive safe¬ 
ty. 

The reinforcements of the B-pillars of the F30 are manufactured from tailored blanks with hot-formed 
steels. 

Tailored blanks are tailor-made printed circuit boards made from sheet steel. Single sheets of varying 
thickness, strength and surface coating are joined together by laser welding. This prefabricated se¬ 
mi-finished product is then formed to the desired component. 

Stronger material is used at places with a higher load. The clever use of material lowers manufacturing 
costs as the high-quality and expensive materials are only used where necessary. Thanks to the use of 
customized steel solutions additional reinforcements and overlap connections at the body are super¬ 
fluous. This saves material and the total weight is reduced further. 

With hot-formed steels, an innovative new development - passive corrosion-proofing - is used. In the 
past, there were no suitable hot-formed sheet metal materials with galvanized corrosion-proofing avail¬ 
able on the market. With the development of press-hardening technology, however, there is now a pro¬ 
cess of manufacturing galvanized hot-formed components that is capable of application in volume pro¬ 
duction. 

It involves initially cold-forming galvanized sheet steel and then heating it to approx. 900 °C. Immedi¬ 
ately afterwards it is cooled directly in the moulding die with integrated water cooling within just a few 
seconds down to approximately 70 °C and thereby hardened. That process gives the components a 
minimum yield strength of well over 1000 MPa. 

The parts produced in that way can be used in areas exposed to moisture without suffering corrosion 
of the basic material. This type of steel does not therefore require any additional corrosion-proofing 
measures. 


2.2. Materials 

A modern vehicle body must meet a great many requirements. Despite small outer dimensions, it 
should provide an interior that is a large as possible. In the event of an accident, the passengers must 
be protected against injury as well as possible. The torque that is generated also means that all units, 
e.g. the engine and transmission, rely on the body for support. Furthermore, the body must have high 
static and above all dynamic strength in order to guarantee the outstanding driving characteristics that 
are typical of BMW.

F30 Introduction 

2. Bodyshell 


Last but not least, the supporting structure of the vehicle must be highly durable and, in the event of an 
accident, it must be possible for repairs to be carried out at a reasonable cost and without an excessive 
amount of work. 

In order to meet all of these requirements, BMW pursues the strategy of creating each component 
from the material best suited for its function. 

The term steel is merely the generic term for the large number of alloys with very different properties 
that are deployed. 



F30 material grades for bodyshell 


Index 

Explanation 

1 

Multi-phase steels (> 300 MPa) 

2 

Hot-formed steels (> 900 MPa) 

3 

Other steels (< 300 MPa) 


Multi-phase steels are steels where the structure consists of a number of phases. Higher-strength 
multi-phase steels with a yield strength R p o .2 of 300 to 600 MPa are, for example, dual-phase steels or 
TRIP steels. Super-strength multi-phase steels with a yield strength R p o .2 in excess of 600 MPa are, 
for example, complex-phase steels or martensitic-phase steels. 

Hot-formed manganese-boron steels are super-strength steels with a yield strength R p o .2 in excess of 
900 MPa.

Weight proportions 

In order to reduce the vehicle weight and still ensure maximum strength of the bodyshell, the propor¬ 
tion of higher/super-strength multi-phase steels and super-strength hot-formed steels is growing.

F30 Introduction 

3. Doors, Lids and Hatches 

In addition to the bodyshell, all doors and flaps for the F30 are also made from steel. 


3.1. Doors 

The door hinges which are secured to both the door and the A- or B-pillar with one screw in each case 
are used in the F30. Previously the door hinges were welded to the A- or B-pillar and secured to the 
door with two screws in each case. 



F30 door hinge 


3.2. Engine compartment lid 

The F30 is also equipped with a comfort opening for the engine compartment lid. The engine com¬ 
partment lid can be unlocked completely from the passenger compartment by means of new, two- 
stroke engine compartment lid catches. The engine compartment lid release lever must be actuated 
twice in succession for this purpose. 

Advantages 

• A release lever does not have to be searched for and actuated at the front of the car 

• Safety is increased by the use of two retaining hooks 

• There is no risk of injury on exposed retaining hooks.

F30 engine compartment lid, engine compartment lid catch 


When the engine compartment lid release lever is activated for the first time, this moves the two en¬ 
gine compartment lid catches into the preliminary detent. The engine compartment lid springs up¬ 
wards by one stage. When the engine compartment lid release lever is released, the engine compart¬ 
ment lid catches are moved into the retaining hook position. 

When the engine compartment lid release lever is actuated again, the engine compartment lid is un¬ 
locked completely and can be opened by simple lifting.

3.3. Tailgate 

The tailgate opens automatically when it is actuated via the remote key or the ID transmitter or the but¬ 
ton on the tailgate. Depending on the vehicle equipment it can also be actuated with the tailgate push¬ 
button on the A-pillar or contactless by means of targeted foot movement. 



£ 


F30 tailgate 

The single-joint hinges open automatically in the open position with help of two tension springs and a 
gas spring damping action. The payload is thus not damaged, the hinge brackets run behind the lug¬ 
gage compartment trim panel. An additional cover ensures a high-quality visible impression and con¬ 
ceals the wiring harness installation arrangement. 

The contactless rear lid opening is installed in vehicles with optional equipment "Comfort Access in¬ 
cluding Smart Opener" (option 322). It is an additional operating element for the tailgate for the cus¬ 
tomer. The operation is effected by means of targeted foot movement to and back from the bumper. 
Two sensors identify the movement via a capacitive measurement in a contactless manner. 

Further information on the contactless rear lid opening can be found in the training manual "F30 Gen¬ 
eral Vehicle Electrical System".

The front end of the F30 can be removed completely. It consists of the bumper, the bumper support, 
the ornamental grille, the lights and trim panels, among others.

F30 Bumper support 

The bumper support of the F30 is made from aluminium thus saving on weight compared to a steel 
version. 


4.2. Underfloor concept 

The virtually smooth underbody throughout reduces drag and lift forces. This improves driving dynam¬ 
ics, reduces fuel consumption and thereby reduces C0 2 emissions. 

Strategically placed air inlets provide for optimum component cooling. The underbody panelling al¬ 
so improve the acoustics and protect the lines and other components against stone chipping and dirt 
contamination. In this way, body and components are protected against corrosion. 

The aerodynamic covers on the rear axle are new in the F30. These features reduce the rear axle lift, 
improve the drag and provide protection against stone chipping.

Changes and damage to the underbody or omitting trim panel components leads to changes in the air 
flow at the underbody. This can influence road grip.

4.3. Sound insulation 

Sound insulation has a major impact on passenger compartment acoustics. A heightened use of 
weight is usually required to achieve a high insulating effect against the noises radiated by the drive- 
train components. 

In order to keep this increase in weight as low as possible, a new and efficient sound insulation con¬ 
cept is used in the F30 in the area of the transmission tunnel and the bulkhead. This combines high 
sheet area stiffness with high damping action and simultaneously high fundamental damping. 

Here sandwich sheets are specifically connected to each other by means of damping compound.
