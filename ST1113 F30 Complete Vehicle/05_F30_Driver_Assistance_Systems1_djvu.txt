F30 Driver Assistance Systems 

1. Introduction 


BMW has long since offered a comprehensive range of driver assist systems. The driver assist sys¬ 
tems facilitate driving of the vehicle by 

• Providing the driver with information 

• Giving the driver suggestions 

• Automatically intervening in the driving process. 

This section contains an overview of all driver assist systems available in the F30. There are also new 
features such as lane change warning. 

The centralization of many control units in the FEM and REM. However, the basic principle and the 
functions of the driver assist systems correspond for the most part to the counterpart systems in the 
current BMW models. 

For further information on the individual systems, please refer to the training material for the F01/F02: 

• DCC F01/F02 

• KAFAS F01/F02.

2.3. Lane departure warning 

The lane departure warning (option 5AD) warns the driver by vibrations in the steering wheel of the in¬ 
advertent departure from a given lane. The prerequisite for this is the presence of suitable roadway or 
lane markings, that can be recognized with the KAFAS video camera of the control unit. The KAFAS 
video camera is accommodated in the mirror base. 

The system can thus support the driver in maintaining his attention. The responsibility for the vehicle 
remains exclusively with the driver. 

The system is designed to support the driver on highways and high-quality country roads. Warnings 
are therefore only issued at speeds greater than 70 km/h or 43 mph. 

The system is activated or deactivated by pressing the button "Lane change warning" in the operating 
facility of the driver assist systems: 

• Activate: LED lights up over the button 

• Deactivate: LED goes out over the button. 

The state is saved for the ID transmitter currently used. 

You can obtain more information on the lane departure warning system in the "KAFAS F01/F02" train¬ 
ing information. 

A 

The system cannot replace a personal assessment of the roads and traffic situation. If the warning is 
issued, do not respond by moving the steering wheel with unnecessary force as this could result in 
control over the vehicle being lost. 


2.4. Collision warning 

The collision warning for equipment without ACC is an integral part of the lane departure warning sys¬ 
tem (option 5AD) and warns the driver of a possible risk of collision. The collision warning is realized 
with help of the KAFAS system. 

2.4.1. Operation 

The system is activated or deactivated by pressing the button "Collision warning" in the operating fa¬ 
cility of the driver assist systems: 

• Activate: LED lights up over the button 

• Deactivate: LED goes out over the button. 

The state is saved for the ID transmitter currently used. 

A display on the CID is opened upon activation of the function. Here the driver can configure the time 
of the early warning in two stages, or deactivate and reactivate the early warning. The state is saved for 
the ID transmitter currently used.

2.4.2. Operating principle 

The system warns of a possible collision from a speed of approx. 15 km/h or 10 mph in two stages. 

The KAFAS video camera records the scenery ahead of the vehicle and uses image processing to de¬ 
tect vehicles and stationary objects in the field of view. The corresponding warning stages are output 
in critical situations on the basis of the calculated positions, distances and relative speeds of the oth¬ 
er vehicles. In addition to the warnings, the vehicle's brakes are prepared for emergency braking in the 
event of an acute warning. In contrast to forward collision warning with braking function, there is, how¬ 
ever, no brake intervention by the system. 

When an object is deliberately approached/driven into, the collision warning is issued later so as to 
avoid unauthorized warnings. 

2.4.3. Warning function 

The warning function corresponds to the collision warning with brake function. The warning function is 
divided into two stages. It is displayed in the instrument cluster. 



Early warning 

The early warning is issued for example in the event of an approaching risk of collision or if the vehicle 
is very close to the vehicle in front. 

The early warning is indicated by a vehicle permanently illuminated in red in the instrument cluster. 

The time of the early warning can be configured in the CID. 

Acute warning 

The acute warning is issued in the event of an immediate risk of collision when the vehicle is approach¬ 
ing another object at a relatively high differential speed. The acute warning cannot be deactivated. 

An acute warning is indicated to the driver by a red flashing vehicle in the instrument cluster. In addi¬ 
tion, an acoustic warning signal is sounded. The acute warning is a prompt for braking intervention and 
if necessary for an evasive maneuver. 

A 

The acute warning does not relieve the driver of their responsibility to adapt their driving speed and 
driving style to the road and traffic conditions.

A 

System limitations mean that warnings may under certain circumstances not be issued or are issued 
too late or without authorization. The driver must therefore always remain alert and observant so that 
they can actively intervene at any time so as to avoid the risk of an accident. 


2.5. Speed Limit Information 

The Speed Limit Detection system is introduced for the first time to the US market with the launch of 
the F30 in 2012. The option 8TH Speed Limit Information is only available in combination with ZDA 
option. 

Note: The Driver Assistance (ZDA) option is necessary because it includes the KAFAS control 
unit. The KAFAS system also incorporates LDW, SLI, Front Collision Warning and High Beam 
Assistant. 

The current posted speed limit signs are displayed in the instrument cluster and in the Head-Up Dis¬ 
play in order to remind the driver not to exceed the legal speed limit. Speed Limit Information function 
works in combination with the Navigation system (option 609). 

Note: Remember that the driver assumes full responsibility for the vehicle and the speed at 
which it is operated at all times. 

The control unit for the Speed Limit Information function is the KAFAS control unit. 

The KAFAS video camera monitors the road signs at the side of the road and takes into account the 
information from the Navigation system (when necessary). The display of the top speed limit signs is 
based on the evaluation of data from the navigation system and the evaluation of image data recorded 
by the KAFAS video camera. 

The KAFAS unit will request the speed limit information from the Navigation only if there are no speed 
limit signs detected. If the data is not available 3 dashes will be displayed. 

The maximum speed allowed of the road currently driven is displayed in the instrument cluster and in 
the Head-Up Display. If the vehicle does not have HUD, the end user can display the speed limit info by 
using the BC button. This is similar to how the mpg or miles to empty is displayed (in the same cluster 
display). If the vehicle has HUD, then it has to be activated in the HUD menu via iDrive. It is important to 
note here that the option 8TH Speed Limit Information pertains only to the maximum or top speed lim¬ 
it posted on the highway. This has nothing to do with ACC or the speed limit warning which can be set 
via the iDrive.

A 

The system cannot replace the driver's personal assessment of the road and traffic situation. Speed 
Limit Information supports the driver and does not replace the human eye. 

This system was specially adapted to the US market to recognize road speed signs only and thus will 
not recognize stop signs, yield signs or any other signs.

3. High-beam Assistant 

The high-beam assistant FLA (option 5AC) assists the customer in the use of the high-beam head¬ 
lights. Depending on the traffic situation, the prevailing ambient light conditions and which lights on 
the vehicle have been switched on, the FLA switches on the high-beam headlights automatically and 
thereby relieves the driver of having to switch on the high-beam headlight manually. 

The high-beam headlight can still be switched on and off manually as usual. The driver always has the 
capability, and indeed the obligation, to override the system whenever the situation requires it. 

The high-beam assistant is only activated in the F30 if the light switch is in the switch position "A". 

The identification of other road users for automatic dipping of the high-beam headlight is effected with 
help of a video camera. The video camera or control used depends on whether other KAFAS system 
components are installed: 

• In the combination with a lane departure warning , the high-beam assistant function is realized 
with the KAFAS video camera and the KAFAS control unit. 

• If the customer only selects the high-beam assistant option, this functionality is implemented 
with a separate FLA video camera and a separate FLA control unit. The video camera and the 
control unit are installed in a shared housing in the inside mirror. 

The FLA video camera is a simplified image sensor that can identify the color and intensity of light. 

For more information on the high-beam assistant system, please refer to the "KAFAS F01/F02" train¬ 
ing information. 

A 

The high-beam assistant cannot replace a personal decision on the use of the high-beam headlight. In 
some situations, manual dipping is required as otherwise there is a safety risk.

4. Lane Change Warning 

The lane change warning (option 5AG) informs the driver at speeds above 50 km/h or 31 mph of possi¬ 
ble collisions in the event of a lane change. 


4.1. Operating principle 

Two 24 GHz radar sensors located under the rear bumper monitor at speeds above 50 km/h or 31 mph 
the space behind and beside the vehicle. The radar sensors are largely weather-dependent and can 
reliably identify vehicles up to a distance of approx. 60 m. In the blind spot range, the radar sensors for 
the lane change warning identify other vehicles on the Neighboring lane up to roughly the center of 
own vehicle.

4.4.2. Warning 

If the turn indicator is set, while a vehicle is in the critical area, the steering wheel vibrates temporarily 
and the light in the mirror housing flashes brightly. The warning ends if the turn indicator is reset to the 
initial position or the other vehicle leaves the critical area. 


4.5. System limits 

A 

The system cannot replace the driver's personal assessment of the road and traffic situation. 

If warnings are issued, do not respond by moving the steering wheel with unnecessary force as this 
could result in control over the vehicle being lost. 

The function can be restricted in the following situations for example: 

• Sharp bends or on narrow roadways 

• Heavy fog, rain or snow 

• Dirty or frozen bumper 

• Labels are attached to the bumper 

• The speed of the approaching vehicle is a great deal higher than own speed.

5. TRSVC 


Surround View provides support for parking, manoeuvring and for complex exits and junctions. In the 
F30 the Surround View optional equipment (option 5DL) is only available in conjunction with the fol¬ 
lowing optional equipment (option 3AG, option 430 and option 508). 

The Surround View optional equipment comprises the following systems: 

• Reversing camera 

• Side View 

• Top View. 

Top View and Side View are part of the Surround View (option 5DL) optional equipment and are not 
available individually. The reversing camera can be ordered separately as optional equipment (option 
3AG). 

The video cameras are connected to the TRSVC control unit via 4-pole low-voltage differential sig¬ 
nalling lines. The control unit is connected to the FEM via K-CAN. 

The TRSVC control unit in integrated in the dashboard. 

There are two variants of the TRSVC control unit: 

• Control unit with a connection for reversing camera 

• Control unit with five connections. 

The Surround View (SA5DL) optional equipment with five video cameras requires the control unit with 
five connections. If only one reversing camera (option 3AG) without Surround View (option 5DL) is in¬ 
stalled, a control unit with one connection is used.

5.3.2. Camera replacement 

These must be taught in after the reversing camera is replaced. The reversing camera of the F30 does 
not need to be calibrated after teaching-in, as it is self-calibrating. The calibration is effected during the 
journey by the TRSVC control unit by means of a steering angle sensor and known road markings. Cal¬ 
ibration compensates for installation tolerances by shifting and rotating the image. 

The maximum time required for a full calibration is five hours. A Check Control message is displayed in 
the CID if the reversing camera could not be successfully calibrated. Reasons for failed calibration may 
be incorrect installation, dirt contamination or a defect with the reversing camera. The reversing cam¬ 
era is also constantly readjusted after a full calibration in order to ensure an optimum image. 

The opening angle of the reversing camera's lens is 130°.

5.4. Top View 

Top View provides support when parking and manoeuvring. For this the door and road area of the vehi¬ 
cle is shown on the CID. 

The Top View function is realized with the reversing camera and the two exterior mirror cameras. 

The opening angle of the lens of the exterior mirror camera, which is installed in the two exterior mir¬ 
rors, is 173°. 


5.4.1. Operation 

The operation is effected similar to the reversing camera. The function is automatically switched on if 
the reverse gear is engaged when the engine is running. The images of the exterior mirror camera and 
PDC are shown when the system has been switched on via iDrive. The system automatically switch¬ 
es off after 20 m travelled or a speed above 20 km/h or 12 mph. The function can also be manually 
switched on and off via the PDC button. 


5.4.2. Display 

The images of the reversing camera and the exterior mirror camera are shown on the CID. In addition, 
the turning circle lines and driving lane lines known from the reversing camera view are also shown.

A 

Also check the traffic situation around the vehicle by looking directly. Otherwise there is a risk of acci¬ 
dents for example from road users or objects that lie outside the image range of the camera. 


5.4.3. Camera replacement 

These must be taught in after the exterior mirror camera is replaced. The exterior mirror camera of the 
F30 does not need to be calibrated after teaching-in, as it is self-calibrating. The calibration is effected 
during the journey by the TRSVC control unit. Installation tolerances are compensated by the calibra¬ 
tion. 


5.5. Side View 

Side View makes possible an early view of the transverse traffic at complex exits and junctions. 

Two bumper cameras, which are installed in the wheel arches of the front bumper, record the traffic 
space at the front side. The two video images of these bumper cameras are shown at the same time 
on the CID (split screen display). Extension lines on the lower edge of the image show the position of 
the front of the vehicle. 

The bumper camera is a common part for the exterior mirror camera with another lens. The opening 
angle of the lens is 55°. 


5.5.1. Operation 

To activate the function press the Side View button of the controller. To deactivate press the button 
again. At speeds above 20 km/h or 12 mph the Side View function is automatically deactivated.

6. Park Distance Control 


Park Distance Control (PDC) assists the driver when manoeuvring in and out of a parking space. The 
current distance from an obstruction is indicated by acoustic signals and on a visual display. PDC is 
available in the F30 in two variants: 

• The PDC front and rear (option 508) utilizes the measured data from four ultrasonic sensors 
on both the front and rear bumpers. 

For vehicles with Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (option 5DP) the PDC sensors are evaluated by the 
PMA control unit and not the REM. 

The PDC is activated by engaging the reverse gear or by operation of the PDC button next to the gear 
selector switch. 

The driver obtains the results of the distance measurement and the distance warning acoustically via 
the speaker system and optically via the display in the CID. 

Further information on the PDC can be found in the training information titled "PDC, TRSVC F01/F02". 

A 

The PDC cannot replace the driver's personal judgement of the traffic situation. Also check the traffic 
situation by taking a look around the vehicle. Otherwise there is a risk of accidents occurring, due to 
other road users or objects that are outside the detection range of the PDC for example. Loud sound 
sources outside and inside the vehicle could drown out the PDC signal.

7. Parking Manoeuvring Assistant 


In the F30 the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant (PMA) is available as optional equipment (option 5DP) in 
association with the optional equipment Park Distance Control front and rear (option 508). 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant facilitates parking in gaps between cars parallel to the roadway. In 
the case of straight forwards travel up to approx. 35 km/h or 22 mph, parking spaces are measured re¬ 
gardless if the PMA is activated or deactivated. As soon as a parking space that is approx. 1.2 m longer 
than the vehicle length is found and the system is already activated, this space is shown to the driver 
on CID. Later on in the parking process, the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant takes over the steering, 
with the driver remaining responsible for the acceleration and braking of the vehicle. With instructions 
and if applicable additional acoustic acknowledgements, the driver is guided through the parking pro¬ 
cedure. 


A 


The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant does not relieve the driver of personal responsibility during park¬ 
ing. 

Directly monitor gaps and the parking procedure and intervene if necessary, as otherwise there is a 
risk of accidents.

Index Explanation 



7.1.2. Sensors 

The two ultrasonic sensors for the PMA are integrated in the front wheel arches. 

The function of the two ultrasonic sensors is similar to that of the PDC. Ultrasonic pulses are transmit¬ 
ted and echo signals are received. The signals are evaluated by the PMA. The length and width of the 
gap is calculated from the distance travelled data from the DSC. 

In the F30 the ultrasonic sensors for the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant are connected individually to 
the PMA.

7.1.3. Control unit 

The control unit for the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant is the PMA. The PMA is located in the luggage 
compartment behind the side trim panel. It evaluates signals from the sensor and thus identifies pos¬ 
sible parking gaps. It also calculates the optimum path into a gap and monitors the parking process. In 
addition, it controls the electromechanical steering via the ICM.

7.2. Notes for Service 

After the PMA or an ultrasonic sensor has been replaced no start-up is necessary. However, the PMA 
checks with every start-up procedure whether the sensor software is compatible with the control unit 
software. If this is not compatible, a corresponding fault code is set in the PMA control unit. In this 
case the service function "update software of ultrasonic sensors" must be performed. 

The PMA itself monitors faults and if required makes the corresponding fault code entries. In excep¬ 
tional cases, this is not always possible. Thus the control unit cannot determine if the ultrasonic sen¬ 
sors (including of the sealing ring) are incorrectly installed or connected, of if there is damage in the 
vicinity of the ultrasonic sensors. This can lead to customer complaints without fault entries: 

• Small gaps are rarely identified 

• During parking, the vehicle drives too close or far away from the vehicle in front 

• The vehicle is either too far away, too close or against the kerb after the parking procedure 

• The vehicle is parked in the gap at an angle. 

In this case it must be ensured that the ultrasonic sensors are correctly installed and the possibility of 
damage of the bumper panel in the vicinity of the ultrasonic sensors must be excluded.

7. Parking Manoeuvring Assistant 

The Parking Manoeuvring Assistant relieves the driver in two ways. On the one hand, from the task of 
having to estimate the size of the gap and on the basis of this estimate of deciding whether the gap is 
large enough. On the other hand, from the task of having to steer into the gap itself. The vehicle is di¬ 
rected solely by the driver. When looking for a parking space and during the actual parking process, all 
relevant information is made available to the driver via the PDC picture in an integrated screen mask. 
This includes: 

• Results of the parking space measurement 

• Status of the Parking Manoeuvring Assistant and corresponding handling information 

• Distances to other objects. 

This makes it especially easy to monitor the parking procedure and at the same time to check the ac¬ 
celeration.

8. DCC 


The cruise control with braking function has been used in many BMW models since the BMW 3 Series 
(E9x). It is also referred to as "Dynamic Cruise Control" (DCC). It relieves the burden on the driver on 
quiet roads by maintaining a constant speed regardless of the resistance to vehicle motion (gradient, 
payload). The driver is still responsible for driving the vehicle when using this support. The driver can 
override the DCC function at any time by braking or accelerating. 

The operation is effected via a keypad in the left steering wheel spoke. The current speed is saved 
by pressing the SET button. The speed is increased or reduced by 1 km/h or .6 mph by touching the 
rocker switch. Each time the rocker switch is pressed above the pressure point the speed is increased 
or reduced by 10 km/h or 6 mph 

DCC constantly maintains a selected speed from approx. 30 km/h or 18 mph 

The brakes are activated during steep downhill driving if sufficient deceleration is not achieved by en¬ 
gine drag torque alone. 

In the F30 the cruise control with braking function is implemented in the ICM control unit.

9. Head-Up Display 

The name "Head-Up" describes the principle benefit of this system. The Head-Up Display (HUD) 
projects a virtual image into the driver's field of view. 

The Head-Up Display (option 610) offers the driver the option of viewing all information relevant for 
driving directly in the field of view freely floating over the roadway. 

the Head-Up Display used in the F30 can project the colors red, green and blue and by mixing these 
colors enables the projection of image content in all colors of the red/green/blue spectrum. The HUD 
is not a slave in the K-CAN in the F30, but has no data bus systems. The HUD receives the control sig¬ 
nals and the image content from the instrument cluster via an APIX interface. The power supply of the 
HUD is also effected in the F30 by the instrument cluster. 


9.1. Operating principle 

The HUD is similar to a projector. A light source is required to project the HUD information. Using 15 
white LEDs the information is shown on a one color, transparent red/green/blue 1.8" display. The reso¬ 
lution is 480x240 pixels. The image obtained is projected into the area of vision of the driver using sev¬ 
eral deflection mirrors and the windshield.

A special windshield is required for the system, whose form enables precise representation. A wedge- 
shaped windshield prevents the illustration of double images. If the standard windshield was used, 
double images would be displayed. 


9.2. Installation location 

The head-up display is fitted above the steering column, immediately behind the instrument cluster. It 
is secured to the bulkhead supporting structure using three screws.
