Introduction 


N74 Engine 

The N74 engine is the successor to the N73 engine, but shares many technical features 
with the N63 engine. Thus the N74 engine also has high precision injection featuring 
outward-opening piezo injectors located centrally in the combustion chamber and twin 
turbochargers with indirect charge air cooling. On the N74 engine, however, the exhaust 
turbochargers are located on the outside of the engine.

N74 Engine Features 

The N74 engine also shares many other common features with the N63 engine, such as 
a volumetric-flow-controlled oil pump and a camshaft drive with tooth-roller type chains. 

By using the latest technology, it has been possible to increase power output substantially, 
while at the same time reducing fuel consumption - Efficient Dynamics in fact.

N74 Engine 










Engine Components/Systems Overview 

The following provides an overview of the features of the N74 engine: 

• Engine block 

The main components of the engine block have been re-designed, although most 
features are already used on other BMW engines. 

• Crankshaft 

Although the Pistons and connecting rods have been borrowed from the N63 
engine, the crankshaft is a new design. 

• Valve train 

The VANOS units from the N63 engine are used and the camshafts are 
manufactured in the same way. The N74 does not use a VALVETRONIC system. 

• Camshaft 

The tooth-roller type chain of the N63 engine is used. Only the chain length and the 
layout of the timing gears have been adapted to suit the twelve-cylinder engine. 

• Belt drive 

The structure of the belt drive includes a “revolver” tensioning system and is identi¬ 
cal to that on the N63 engine. 

• Oil supply 

Though the oil supply system has been designed for the N74 engine, in principle, 
it's the same as that on the N63 engine. Consequently a volumetric-flow-controlled 
oil pump is also used here. 

• Crankcase ventilation 

The engine uses the same crankcase ventilation principle as N63 engine with a new 
feature called register ventilation. With this feature, the oil separators now have four 
cyclones per cylinder bank and in naturally-aspirated operation, ventilation only 
occurs via cylinder bank 2. 

• Cooling system 

Two separate cooling circuits are used as on N63, one to cool the engine and 
turbocharger bearings and one for charge air cooling, this latter circuit also provides 
cooling for the two engine control units. 


11 

N74 Engine 



• Air intake and exhaust system 

The air intake and exhaust systems are the same as that on the N63 engine. 

This means there are two conventional exhaust turbochargers with wastegate and 
blow-off valves. In contrast to the N63 engine, however, the exhaust turbochargers 
are located on the outside. 

• Secondary air system 

As with N73 engine, the N74 is equipped with a secondary air system. 

One new feature, however, are the two pressure sensors that monitor system 
operation. 

• Vacuum system 

The N74 engine has a two-stage vacuum pump as on the N63. The vacuum 
system only differs in that it has two vacuum reservoirs. 

• Fuel system 

The N74 engine uses “injection guided” (HPI) high precision injection in homoge¬ 
neous operation at all times, as on the N54 and N63 engines. The structure of the 
system is the same as that on the N63 engine. Consequently, the same injectors are 
used and the high pressure pumps are also very similar. 

• Engine electrical system 

A total of five control units were used on the N73 for engine control purposes. 

The N74 now has two engine control units, one of which has the role of the master 
(primary), the other the secondary. The two MSD87-12 control units are located to 
the left and right of the engine compartment and are cooled by the low temperature 
cooling circuit of the engine intercoolers. 


The N74 engine uses the most current BMW systems. Although the N74 engine has 
been designed from scratch, from a technology point of view it is, the same as the N63 
engine and has also borrowed many individual components from this engine.

Engine Identification 
Engine designation 

In the technical documentation, the engine designation is used to ensure the clear 
identification of engines. 

The N74 engine is available in the following version: N74B60U0 

In the technical documentation, you will also find the short form of the engine designation 
N74 which only permits identification of the engine type. 

The following chart explains the meaning of each component of the engine designation.

Engine identification and number 

To ensure clear identification and classification, the engines have an identification mark 
on the crankcase. This engine identification is also necessary for approval by the 
authorities. 

Decisive here are the first seven positions. The N74 engine has an engine identification 
that complies with the new standard, in which the first six positions are the same as the 
engine designation. The seventh position is a consecutive letter that can be used for 
various distinctions, e.g. power stage or exhaust emission standard. A general assignment 
is not possible, but an "A" usually means the basic model. 

The engine number is a consecutive number that permits unmistakable identification of 
each individual engine. The engine designation and number are on the crankcase behind 
the bracket for the air conditioning compressor. 


13 

N74 Engine 





Engine Components 

Engine Block 

The engine block of the N74 engine is a new design. It is similar to the N63 engine 
concept, but with a cylinder bank angle of 60° and the following features: 

• Block made of an aluminum alloy (Alusil) 

• Closed deck crankcase design 

• Honed cylinder liners 

• Lowered side walls (deep skirt) with main bearing caps 

• Double main bearing bolting with additional side wall connection. 



The closed-deck design and the bolt connections of the cylinder heads in the bottom of 
the cylinder housing ensure high rigidity and low deformation of the exposure-honed 
cylinder liners. 

The crankcase with lowered side walls (deep skirt) has double main bearing bolting 
with additional side wall connections by means of threaded support sleeves and bolts 
designed to absorb the lateral forces from the crankshaft common on the V-engine con¬ 
figuration. 

There are coolant passages to cool the (hot zone) area between the cylinders. In order 
to keep the pumping losses in the crankcase to a minimum, there are one to six ventila¬ 
tion holes below each of the main bearing seats. 

The use of separate channels for the oil return from the cylinder heads and for crankcase 
ventilation reduces the amount of oil in the blow-by gases. 

As on the N63 engine, the torgue converter is bolted onto the flywheel through an 
opening in the converter housing with six bolts positioned at an angle of 30°. This 
makes it easier to replace the transmission. 


14 

N74 Engine 




Cylinder Head 

The cylinder head features the injector and spark plugs arranged in the center of the 
combustion chamber. The layout of the high pressure fuel pumps is similar to that on the 
N63 engine; however because of the conventional cylinder head arrangement (intake side 
on the inside, exhaust side on the outside) they are located above the intake camshafts 
(respectively between cylinders 1 and 2 and 7 and 8). 

As on the N63 engine, the intake port features a trailing edge (around the valve seats) for 
creating more intensive charge movement. 

Coolant flows diagonally across the cylinder head (from the outer side of the engine 
towards the V chamber), whereby the inlet is at the outside rear and the outlet at the 
inside front. This is referred to as diagonal cooling. 

As on the N63 engine, only one non-return valve for the oil circuit is incorporated into 
the cylinder head. The N74 uses two VANOS non-return valves, they are now integrated 
into the VANOS solenoid valves. 

Cylinder Head Cover 

The cylinder head covers are made of die-cast aluminum. They accommodate the oil 
separation of the crankcase ventilation. The oil separators are made of plastic and are 
very similar to those in the N63 engine. 

Oil Sump 

The engine oil sump is structured in two parts. The upper and lower sections of the die- 
cast aluminum oil sump have been optimized with regard to strength and acoustics. 

A two-part oil deflector also ensures particularly low oil foaming in extreme driving situa¬ 
tions. A surge plate ensures that an adeguate oil level is achieved in the case of high 
longitudinal and lateral dynamic forces. 

The thermostat for the engine oil cooler as well as the oil filter with an oil filter insert made 
of synthetic fleece are integrated in the engine oil sump. The lower section of the oil 
sump contains the oil level sensor that enables electronic oil level measurement. There is 
no oil dipstick.

Crankcase Ventilation 


Crankcase ventilation works to a large extent in the same way as on the N63 engine. 
However, the N74 has register ventilation, which is also used on the S63 engine.

Each cylinder bank has its own oil separation system which includes four cyclone separa¬ 
tors. 


In naturally-aspirated mode, the cleaned blow-by gas is introduced downstream of the 
exhaust turbochargers through the non return valves that connect to the intake manifold. 



Bank 1 non

In boost mode it is introduced upstream of the exhaust turbochargers through the non 
return flaps leading to the fresh air pipes on each bank. In contrast to the N63 engine, the 
crankcase ventilation systems for the left and right cylinder banks are not completely 
separate from each other. 


Register Ventilation 

Unlike the N63 engine, this engine uses register ventilation, a system that is already famil¬ 
iar from the S63 engine. In this system, when the engine is operating in naturally-aspirat¬ 
ed mode, the crankcase is only ventilated via the oil separation system of cylinder bank 2 
(left). As a result, the efficiency of the oil separator in partial load operation is increased. 

The crankcase is crossflow ventilated by introducing fresh air via the oil separator on 
cylinder bank 1. Fresh air is drawn into the system through an orifice in the (bankl) non¬ 
return valve. Ventilating the crankcase with fresh air removes water and fuel components 
more effectively, increasing the service life of the oil and reducing the moisture in the 
lines. This reduces the danger of freezing, therefore the N74 engine does not reguire 
heating for the crankcase ventilation. 

For normal engine operation, the crankcase ventilation ensures a vacuum of maximum 
70 mbar in the crankcase. During catalytic converter heating, higher vacuum can also 
occur. 


18 

N74 Engine 



Oil Separation 

The structure of the oil separator is also the same as that on the N63 engine. Labyrinth 
and cyclone oil separators are used. One labyrinth and four of the cyclones are integrat¬ 
ed in the oil separator housing of each cylinder bank. In contrast to the N63 engine, all 
four cyclones are now used here.

N74 Engine 






























Crankshaft 


This is a forged crankshaft with hardened running surfaces. A central hole through the 
main bearing and holes in the crank pin contribute to reducing the weight. To reduce fuel 
consumption, the main bearing diameters of the crankshaft have been reduced from 70 
mm to 65 mm. This also enables the use of a double main bearing bolt connections with¬ 
out enlarging the crankcase. As on the N63 engine, the oil pump is driven on the flywheel 
side by the crankshaft. The camshaft sprocket is directly integrated into the crankshaft. 

Crankshaft Bearings 

The main crankshaft bearings are two-component bearing shells. 

Connecting Rods 

The cracked forged connecting rods with trapezoidal wrist pin bosses have been 
borrowed from the N63 engine. On the rod side, they have three-component sputter 
bearing shells; three-component bearing shells are fitted on the cover side. 

Pistons 

The Alusil cylinder bores mean the pistons are iron-coated. 

Camshaft 

The tooth-roller type chain, which was first introduced on the N63 engine, is used for the 
camshaft drive. Only its length is different. The tooth- roller type chain combines the 
advantages of a tooth type chain and a roller type chain to provide high resistance to wear 
and low noise. 

The chain tensioners, tensioning rails and slide rails are common components for both 
cylinder banks. 

In contrast to the N63 engine, the N74 engine is once again disconnected at cylinder 
1 firing TDC. However, the same special tool is used to disconnect it. It is placed on the 
torsional vibration damper and forms the reference point for the alignment pin with 
respect to the crankcase. 

Chain Tensioner 

The hydraulic chain tensioner is a common part shared with the N63 engine. The N74 
engine has a chain tensioner for each cylinder bank. It is a hydraulic chain tensioner that 
acts on a tensioning rail. Each one is arranged within the chain track to save space. 

The oil spray nozzles for timing chain lubrication are integrated in the chain tensioners. 

Note: Before removal, the chain tensioner must be fully retracted and secured 
with the special tool supplied for the purpose. Always follow the proce¬ 
dure in the repair instructions.

VANOS 

Like all current BMW gasoline engines, the N74 engine is also eguipped with variable 
double VANOS. The VANOS units are common parts shared with the N63 engine, with 
the exception of the intake unit on cylinder bank though this is also designed to the same 
principle, it features a drive flange with a slot for the vacuum pump. The N74 uses two 
VANOS non-return valves, they are now integrated into the VANOS solenoid valves. 

The VANOS units have the following adjustment angles: 

• VANOS unit intake: 50° crank angle 

• VANOS unit exhaust: 50° crank angle 

Camshafts 

As on the N63 engine, the camshafts are thermally jointed and have forged cams, a steel 
flange for the VANOS units (including width across flats and mounting flats for the special 
tool) and a sintered camshaft sensor wheel as reference for the camshaft position sensor. 
The intake camshafts each have an additional 3-way cam to drive the high pressure 
pumps. 


Roller Cam Followers 

Roller cam followers are also used in the N74 engine as transfer elements of the cam 
movement onto the valves. New is a directional oil splash bore hole in the contact surface 
of the roller cam follower on the hydraulic valve clearance compensating element. The oil 
from the hydraulic valve clearance compensating element splashes precisely onto the 
contact surface between the camshaft and roller cam follower. This supplies the roller and 
the cam with oil for cooling and lubrication.

Belt Drive 

The main belt drive, a drive belt with seven ribs, drives: 

• the power steering pump 

• the air-cooled 210 A alternator and 

• the mechanical coolant pump.

N74 Engine 






















The main belt drive has a mechanical tensioning pulley that applies the necessary tension 
to the poly- V belt. The use of a smooth belt pulley for the coolant pump drive enables a 
partial shift in the belt wear to the tips of the belt ribs. This has a positive effect on the 
service life of the belt. 

A patented drainage system on the belt pulleys of the crankshaft and the power steering 
pump drains off water that may enter between the belt and pulley in the event the engine 
is splashed with a large amount of water or if the vehicle is driven through a puddle. 

The auxiliary belt drive for the AC compressor has an elastic belt with four ribs. Using the 
“revolver” belt tensioning system from the N63 engine makes it possible to eliminate the 
tensioning pulley and related components. 

The belt drive is driven by the primary side of the torsional vibration damper (harmonic 
balancer). The belt pulley is securely connected to the crankshaft. This is a new feature: 
the belt pulley is usually connected to the secondary side (the side that is flexibly con¬ 
nected to the crankshaft). As a general principle, it is the task of the harmonic balancer to 
counteract the torsional vibrations of the crankshaft. Here, the secondary side is also sub¬ 
jected to torsional vibrations that have a greater amplitude than those on the crankshaft. 

By reducing the torsional vibrations at the drive pulley, the loads on the belts are mini¬ 
mized, this has a positive effect on service life.

Oil Pump 

The pendulum slide cell pump is, with the exception of the intake snorkel and the cover, 
identical to the oil pump in the N63 engine. On N74 it is also driven off a cast gear on the 
flywheel side of the crankshaft via a chain.

Volumetric flow control means that only the quantity of oil actually required for the respec¬ 
tive operating condition is supplied. This reduces the amount of power required to drive 
the oil pump and also reduces oil wear. Regulation is achieved by utilising the pressure of 
the oil in the system downstream of the oil filter; the pressure acts on the pendulum slide 
and in so doing adjusts the delivery rate. 

Pressure Limiting Valve 

The pressure limiting valve is integrated into the oil pump. Pressure is applied to it 
upstream of the filter and it opens at a pressure of approximately 18 bar. When it opens, 
it releases surplus oil directly into the oil sump. 

Oil Filter 

The N74 engine has the usual full-flow oil filter. In the same way as the predecessor, the 
synthetic-fleece oil filter is bolted onto the oil sump from below. This arrangement means 
that neither a discharge valve nor a non-return valve is required. The filter bypass valve is 
located in the oil filter cover. 

Oil Cooling 

The thermostat for oil cooling is also integrated into the oil sump. It only lets the oil flow 
over the oil cooler as of a certain oil temperature, thus ensuring rapid heating of the 
engine oil. The oil coolers used are two engine oil to air heat exchangers. These are 
positioned behind the trim panel of the front bumper in the wheel arches. 

Oil Spray Nozzles 

Oil spray nozzles are always used when an oil duct cannot be routed directly to the lubri¬ 
cation and cooling point. In the N74 engine, these are the usual positions, namely the oil 
spray nozzles for piston crown cooling and the oil spray nozzles for timing chain lubrica¬ 
tion. 


28 

N74 Engine 



Oil spray nozzles for piston crown cooling 

In the same way as in the N63 engine, the pistons are cooled by an oil spray from the 
underside. Six double oil spray nozzles are used. They only open (pressure-controlled) 
above 1.5 bar, thus enabling an adequately high volumetric flow of oil to maintain the 
VANOS adjustment in hot-idling mode. 

Oil spray nozzles for timing chain lubrication 

The oil spray nozzles for timing chain lubrication are integrated in the chain tensioners of 
the two cylinder banks. They spray the engine oil directly onto the timing chains. 

A restrictor in the oil spray nozzle limits the oil quantity delivered. 

Oil Level Measurement 

The familiar QLT (Quality Level Temperature) oil condition sensor is used in the N74 
engine. This implements the electronic oil level measurement. No oil dipstick is used. 


29 

N74 Engine 



Engine Cooling 

Because of the turbocharging and indirect charge air cooling, the N74 engine has the 
same cooling reguirements as the N63 engine. Conseguently it too has two separate 
cooling circuits. One is for cooling the engine and exhaust turbochargers, the other is for 
charge air cooling and for cooling the two engine control units. 

The engine cooling system performs the task of drawing heat off the engine and 
maintaining the operating temperature as constant as possible. As on the N54 and N63 
engines, the two exhaust turbochargers are also cooled. 

On the N74 engine, the coolant passages have been integrated mainly in the engine 
block. Optimizations to the engine cooling circuit have enabled a significant reduction in 
the coolant guantity for the bypass mode, thus shortening the warm-up phase. 

The coolant feed line downstream of the coolant pump is routed directly beside the 
engines main oil duct. The oil in the main oil duct flows in the opposite direction to the 
coolant. This enhances the heat exchange between the two media, and has a positive 
effect on the engine oil temperature. The overall cooling effect is comparable with that of 
an engine oil-coolant heat exchanger.

The coolant passages in the cylinder heads are similar to the N63 engine. The coolant 
flows through the cylinder heads diagonally from the outside to the inside, whereby it 
flows in at the rear (outside) and flows out at the front (inside). This is also known as 
diagonal cooling. 

As on the N63 engine, an additional electric coolant pump is used which supplies the 
bearings of the exhaust turbochargers with coolant. 


31 

N74 Engine 





Coolant Pumps 
Main coolant pump 

The main coolant pump is a conventional coolant pump driven mechanically by the belt 
drive. 

Auxiliary water pump for exhaust turbochargers 

Like the N63 engine, the N74 engine has an electric auxiliary water pump which allows 
heat to be dissipated from the exhaust turbochargers even after the engine has been 
switched off. This coolant pump has an electrical power output of 20 W. It is also used 
during engine operation to support exhaust turbocharger cooling. The electric auxiliary 
coolant pump is activated based on the following factors: 

• Coolant temperature at the engine outlet 

• Engine oil temperature 

• Injected volume of fuel 

The injected volume of fuel is used to calculate the heat contribution to the engine. 
Operation is similar to that of the heat management system on the 6-cylinder engines. 
The after-running period of the electrical auxiliary coolant pump can last up to 30 
minutes. 

To improve the cooling effect, the electric fan is also switched on. As in previous systems, 
the electric fan runs for a maximum of 11 minutes, however, it now operates more fre¬ 
quently. 

Expansion Tank 

For space reasons, the expansion tank is located in the front fender behind the wheel 
arch. A separate filling canister bolted to the front of the engine enables filling. The expan¬ 
sion tank and filling canister are interconnected by an expansion and tank ventilation line.

N74 Engine 



Charge Air Cooling 

The N63 engine was the first BMW engine to use indirect charge air cooling; this has 
now also been adopted for the N74 engine. The heat is extracted from the charge air by 
means of an air to coolant heat exchanger. This heat is then released to the ambient air 
across a coolant to air heat exchanger. To achieve this, the charge air cooling has its own 
low-temperature cooling circuit. This is independent of the engine cooling circuit.

Auxiliary Coolant Pump for Charge Air Cooling 

The cooling circuit for charge air cooling is operated with a 50 W pump, it does not run 
automatically when the engine is switched on. 

The following parameters are used for the auxiliary pump activation: 

• Outside temperature 

• Difference between charge-air temperature and outside temperature. 

Charge-air Cooler 

The charge air coolers (intercoolers) are attached to the intake system near the rear of the 
cylinder heads. They enable efficient cooling of the charge air by extracting heat energy 
from the air charge and carrying it away to the coolant to air heat exchanger located in the 
front of the vehicle. 


35 

N74 Engine 





Engine Control Unit 

The low temperature cooling circuit for charge air cooling also cools the two engine con¬ 
trol units. A cooling line from the low-temperature cooling circuit is connected to the 
housing of the control units. 

Intake Air Duct 

The air intake duct consists of two lines with engine-mounted intake silencers. The 
arrangement leads to minimum pressure losses on the intake and pressure sides. The air 
is drawn in on both sides of the engine through a duct behind the front grille. An air intake 
resonator on each side enhances the acoustic characteristics of the system. 

Hot film air mass meters (digital HFM 7) with integrated electric throttle valves are used. 
They are located in the outlet pipe of each turbocharger, bolted to the inlet of the inter¬ 
cooler.

N74 Engine 



Turbocharging 

Exhaust Turbocharger 

As already mentioned, the turbochargers on the N74 engine are located on the outside. 
In the case of a VI 2-cylinder engine with 60° cylinder angle, this is the optimal arrange¬ 
ment of the turbocharger system. 

These are conventional single scroll turbochargers (no variable turbine geometry, VNT, or 
twin scroll are used) in which vacuum-controlled wastegate valves are used for charging 
pressure control. 



The turbocharging process on the N74 engine is identical, in terms of its principle to 
that utilised on the N63 engine. Each bank of cylinders has its own (relatively small) 
turbocharger, which ensures fast response even at low engine speeds. The charging 
pressure control is via wastegate valves. Blowoff valves are also used.

Charging Pressure Control 

The charging pressure (Boost) of the turbochargers is directly dependent on the exhaust 
flow that enters the turbines and it determines the speed of the turbocharger. Both the 
speed and the mass of the exhaust flow are directly dependent on the engine speed as 
well as the engine load. The Digital Motor Electronics controls the charging pressure 
through the wastegate valves. The wastegate valves are operated by vacuum units and 
are controlled by the DME through vacuum solenoids (EPDW). 

The vacuum is generated using the permanently driven vacuum pump of the engine and 
stored in two vacuum reservoirs. It is ensured that these consumers do not have a nega¬ 
tive influence on the function of the power brake booster by using a two stage 
vacuum pump. 

The wastegate valves can influence how much of the exhaust flows through the turbine 
wheel. Once the charging pressure has reached the desired level, the flap of the waste- 
gate valve starts to open and a portion of the exhaust flow is routed past the turbine 
wheel. The decreased exhaust flow through the turbine prevents the speed of the com¬ 
pressor from increasing further. 

In full load operation, the N74 engine works with an excess boost pressure of up to 0.7 
bar in the intake manifold. 

Blow-off control 

Like the N63 engine, the N74 has electric diverter (blow-off) valves incorporated directly 
into the turbochargers. 

The blow-off valves reduce unwanted peaks in the charge air pressure that can arise 
when the throttle valve is closed guickly. In doing so, they perform an important function 
with regard to engine acoustics and contribute to protecting the components of the tur¬ 
bochargers. 



Diverter (Blow-off) Valve 


39 

N74 Engine 





If the throttle valve is closed, the charging pressure (before the throttle valve) and its rise 
are compared with stored nominal values. If the actual values are a certain value above 
the nominal values, the blowoff valves are opened. This diverts the boost pressure to the 
intake side of the compressor and eliminates the unwanted pressure that can damage 
system components. 

Charge Air Cooling 

Like the N63, the N74 engine also has indirect charge air cooling. The heat from the 
pressurized fresh air is transferred to the coolant flowing inside two (air to coolant) inter¬ 
coolers. Then it flows to a dedicated heat exchanger where the heat energy is then 
released into the ambient air. This system enables the charge air pipe length to be kept 
very short, thereby reducing pressure losses. 

The charge air coolers are mounted on top of the engine, directly connected to the air 
intake system. 



Intake Manifold 

The air intake system is plastic and located in the V chamber of the engine. The left and 
right sides are separate. This is why there are also two charging pressure sensors at the 
rear end of the air intake system.

Exhaust Manifold 

Air-gap-insulated exhaust manifolds are used, they promote faster heating of the catalytic 
converters. They have a 6 into 2 into 1 design which optimizes the gas flow based on the 
ignition firing sequence. 


Exhaust Emissions 

The catalytic converters are installed very close to the engine, directly behind the tur¬ 
bocharger turbines. This ensures the catalytic converters reach their operating tempera¬ 
ture quickly. The use of the latest exhaust gas sensors, the LSU ADV exhaust gas oxygen 
sensor and a secondary air system means that the engine complies with the strict ULEV 
2 exhaust emission standards. 

Secondary Air System 

As on N73 engine, the N74 is equipped with a secondary air system. Blowing additional 
air (secondary air) into the exhaust gas duct in the cylinder head during the warm-up 
phase initiates thermal post-combustion that leads to a reduction in the unburned hydro¬ 
carbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) contained in the exhaust gas. The energy gen¬ 
erated here heats up the catalytic converter faster in the warm-up phase and increases its 
conversion rate. The catalytic converter response temperature (light-off temperature) of 
300°C is reached only a few seconds after the engine is started. 

What is new is that there is one pressure sensor before each secondary air valve. The 
function of the secondary air system is monitored by registering the pressure conditions. 

Secondary air pump 

The electrically operated secondary air pump is attached to the cylinder head of cylinder 
bank 1. 

During the warm-up phase, the pump draws in fresh air from the engine compartment. 
This is cleaned by the filter integrated in the pump 
and delivered across the pressure line to the two 
secondary air valves. 

After the engine start, the secondary air pump is 
supplied with vehicle voltage by the DME via the 
secondary air pump relay. The switched-on period 
is about 20 seconds and it depends essentially on 
the coolant temperature at engine start. It is activat¬ 
ed from a coolant temperature of +5°C to +50°C 
(40°F to 120°F). 





42 

N74 Engine 







Secondary air valve 

A secondary air valve is bolted onto the rear of each cylinder head. The secondary air 
valve opens as soon as the system pressure generated by the secondary air pump 
exceeds the opening pressure of the valve. Secondary air is fed via the secondary air line 
into the elongated passage of the cylinder head. From the elongated passage, 24 tap 
holes lead to the 12 exhaust ducts where the thermal post-combustion takes place. 

The secondary air valve closes as soon as the secondary air pump switches off, thus pre¬ 
venting exhaust gas from flowing back to the secondary air pump. 



Secondary Air Valve 
and Pressure Sensor 


On-board diagnosis of secondary air system 

Monitoring takes place with the help of the pressure sensors that are fitted before each 
of the secondary air valves. The exhaust gas oxygen sensors are also used. 

The overall diagnosis is divided into a rough diagnosis that begins immediately after the 
secondary air pump starts up and the fine diagnosis that begins around 12 to 14 seconds 
after the secondary air injection starts. 

The rough diagnosis uses only the pressure signals. Every fault in the secondary air sys¬ 
tem is detected if there is a drop below a minimum pressure in the event of a leakage or if 
a maximum pressure is exceeded when a valve is clogged or jammed closed. However, 
under certain circumstances, it might not be possible to assign the fault correctly, 
because the pressure sensors indicate the same pressure due to the connecting line. 

The fine diagnosis uses the exhaust gas oxygen sensor signals in addition to the pressure 
signals. The combination of exceeding or falling short of fault thresholds for the pressure 
and exhaust gas oxygen sensor values means the fault can be precisely assigned to the 
relevant cylinder bank. The fine diagnosis relies on the oxygen sensor readiness, this is 
available much later than in naturally aspirated engines due to the heat loss through the 
turbocharger. 

There is also an electrical diagnosis for the secondary air pump relay and for the pressure 
sensors. These indicate the usual electrical faults (line disconnection, short circuit to 
ground, short circuit to supply voltage). There is an additional mutual plausibility check of 
the pressure sensors on initialization with ambient pressure. 


43 

N74 Engine 


Vacuum System 

The vacuum system is similar to that of the N63 engine. A two-stage vacuum pump is 
used, the main stage of which generates the vacuum for the brake servo. The auxiliary 
stage generates the vacuum to activate the wastegate valves of the exhaust turbocharg¬ 
ers and the exhaust flaps.

In contrast to the N63 engine, the N74 engine has two vacuum reservoirs for the waste-

(EPDW) for the wastegate valves are mounted directly on the vacuum reservoirs (see 
arrows).

Fuel Injection 

The N74 engine is equipped with high precision injection. This second generation direct 
fuel injection operates in homogeneous operation at all times and has the same structure 
as on the N63 engine.

The fuel is delivered to the high pressure pump from the fuel tank by the electric fuel 
pump via the feed line at a delivery pressure of 5 bar. The delivery pressure is monitored 
by the fuel pressure sensor. The fuel is supplied by the electric fuel pump depending on 
engine requirements. If this sensor fails, the operation of the electric fuel pump continues 
with a 100% delivery rate at terminal 15 ON. The fuel is compressed in the permanently 
driven single-piston high pressure pump and fed via the high pressure line into the fuel 
rail. The pressurized fuel in the rail is distributed via the high pressure lines to the piezo 
injectors. 

The required fuel pressure is determined by the DME depending on engine speed and 
load. The pressure reading is picked up by the rail pressure sensor and sent to the DME. 
Control takes place on the basis of a nominal/actual comparison of the rail pressure by the 
quantity control valve. With 200 bar of fuel pressure only required at high load and lower 
engine speed. The purpose of the system is to achieve the smoothest operation with the 
lowest possible fuel consumption.

High Pressure Pump 

The high pressure pump is, in principle, the same as the one used on the N63 engine. 
The only difference is that the fuel lines are positioned at a different angle.

The fuel is delivered to the high-pressure pump via the inlet with delivery pressure gener¬ 
ated by the electric fuel pump. The fuel is then fed via the volume control valve and into 
the compression chamber of the pump element. In this pump element, the fuel is placed 
pressurized by a plunger and supplied via the high-pressure non-return valve to the high- 
pressure connection. The high-pressure pump is bolted onto the cylinder head and is 
driven by the camshaft by a triple cam. This means that, as soon as the engine is running, 
the triple cam continuously moves the plunger. Fuel is pressurized until new fuel is deliv¬ 
ered via the volume control valve into the high-pressure pump. The volume control valve 
is activated by the engine management system; it specifies the delivered volume of fuel. 
Pressure regulation takes place via the volume control valve in that it is opened or closed 
by the pump element towards the fuel feed. When the quantity control valve is opened, 
most of the fuel drawn in by the piston is pressed back into the fuel feed. 

The maximum pressure in the high-pressure area is restricted to 245 bar. If the maximum 
high pressure is reached, the high-pressure circuit is relaxed to the low-pressure area by a 
pressure limiting valve. In this case the pressure peak in the low pressure area is compen¬ 
sated for by the fluid volume in the area and pressure damper in the compensating cham¬ 
ber. The compensating chamber is integrated into the inlet towards the high pressure 
pump. This ensures that pressure peaks are lowered by connecting and disconnecting 
the high and low-pressure areas. When the piston generates pressure, fuel flows 
between the piston and its guide. This is deliberate, as it lubricates the pair of sliding ele¬ 
ments. On downward movement of the pressure piston, a high pressure would arise at its 
rear side. This would lead to danger if the fuel is pressed through the sealing of the piston 
from the pump into the oil circuit of the engine. The connection to the compensating 
chamber means that there is never a higher pressure behind the piston than in the fuel 
feed. This prevents pressure fluctuations from being transferred into the low pressure fuel 
system, as the volume changes in front of and behind the piston are balanced.

The volume control valve controls the fuel delivery pressure in the rail. In the induction 
stroke with the quantity control valve opened, the entire compression chamber is filled 
with fuel via the low-pressure area. In the compression stroke, the point in time when the 
quantity control valve closes determines how much fuel is pumped back into the low- 
pressure area and how much of the remaining stroke is used for the compression and the 
effective high pressure delivery. In addition, the pressure limiting valve provides the possi¬ 
bility to reduce the pressure in the rail in that fuel is fed out of the high-pressure fuel sys¬ 
tem back into the pump element. 

Injectors 

The outward opening, piezo injectors are an integral part of the “spray-guided” injection 
strategy used on the HPI injection system. These are already familiar from the N54 and 
N63 engines. 


Outward-opening Piezo Injector 

The piezo injector is integrated into the cylinder head together with the spark plug in the 
center of the combustion chamber between the intake and exhaust valves. This installa¬ 
tion position prevents the cylinder walls or piston crown from being soaked with injected 
fuel. An even formation of the homogeneous fuel-air mixture is achieved with the help of 
the gas turbulence in the combustion chamber and a stable fuel cone. The gas motion is 
influenced by the geometry of the inlet ports on the one hand and by the shape of the 
piston crown on the other. The injected fuel is swirled in the combustion chamber with 
the charge air until a homogeneous fuel-air mixture is available everywhere in the com¬ 
pression chamber at the ignition point. 

Control Unit 

Two water-cooled MSD87-12 control units are used. The same watertight components 
as those on the MSD85 (N63 engine in the F01) have been used. As on the predecessor 
engine N73, a primary (master) and secondary concept strategy has been implemented 
with the two control units. They have the same hardware, software and data records. The 
connected sensor system runs an automatic primary (master) and secondary identifica¬ 
tion. In this arrangement, the master is responsible for communication with the complete 
vehicle and the specified nominal values for the engine functions. The control unit is 
designed with the current software for the vehicle network with FlexRay.
