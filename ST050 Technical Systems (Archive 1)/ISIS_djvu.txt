Integrated Service Information Server 








Introduction 


The Integrated Service Information Server (ISIS) is the intelligent server system for the 
workshop of the future. This integration server platform is designed to further improve 
service department/workshop performance. The generation of diagnostic and program¬ 
ming systems, available with ISID, ICOM, ISAP and IMIB is based on the ISIS server 
platform concept. A new generation of service applications and software, based on the 
ISPI platform is utilized. This ISPI service application and software suite consist of ISTA, 
ETK, and KSD.

The ISIS system consists of the following hardware components: 

• Rack cabinet (ventilated) 

• Two Fujitsu Siemens PRIMERGY servers RX300 S3 

• MGE Pulsar M3000 UPS with a Hot Swap Maintenance By Pass Module 

• HP ProCurve 1800-24G LAN switch 

• Device shelf to support two Software Service Stations (SSS) that are already 
present in the workshop 

• Cabling

ISIS Rack Cabinet 


The rack cabinet is supplied to the US market in one configuration: “Ventilated”. 

A 19 inch standard network rack mount has been utilized by some centers. The network 
room for this type of rack mount must be air conditioned and meet the 50 to 77 degrees 
Fahrenheit temperature requirement. The room must be secured by a lockable door. 
This also applies to a network room for an ISIS rack cabinet. 

ISIS Ventilated Rack Cabinet 

The ventilated rack cabinet contains the two ISIS servers, capacity to house two SSS 
units, a UPS unit with MPS, and a HP LAN switch. The ventilated rack cabinet weighs 
approximately 700 lbs and occupies a space of 48 cubic feet. The main structure/ 
housing is a sealed four post aluminum frame which includes a cross-flow ventilation 
and filtration system. 

ISIS Rack Cabinet Storage Area 

The ventilated rack cabinet must have a clear, clean area around its perimeter. A dis¬ 
tance between the front and back of the ISIS rack cabinet must be at least 36 inches 
and a distance on both sides of 12 inches should be maintained. 

Note: In areas with greater space restrictions a minimum of 36 inches must 
be maintained behind the cabinet. 

ISIS Rack Cabinet Security 

Security of the ISIS rack cabinet is maintained by a key lock mounted on the front and 
rear doors handles. Both side panels of the ISIS rack cabinet are also key locked. Two 
keys per door and per side panels are supplied at time of installation. 

ISIS Rack Cabinet Cooling 

The ISIS rack cabinet has an air filter mat mounted in its base with two cooling exhaust 
fans (225 CFM) mounted on the rear door. Cooling air is drawn in from the bottom of 
the ISIS rack cabinet across a cleanable/replaceable air filter mat. The cleaned air is 
allowed to flow in and around the two ISIS servers, two SSS units, UPS unit with MPS, 
and a HP LAN switch. The cooling air is exhausted out the two rear door mounted fans. 


Note: Cooled clean air must be allowed to flow thru the ISIS rack cabinet. All 
doors must be fully closed and locked. Doors should not be left open. 
Please check for door shipping blocks that might not have been removed 
during installation. These door shipping blocks are attached by red duct 
tape to the lower corner of the door on the opening side on both doors. 
These door shipping blocks must be removed and discarded.

ISIS Servers Units 



The two “Fujitsu Siemens RX300 S3” rack server units are the core elements of the 
ISIS computer system. 

Technical Specifications 

• Two “INTEL XEON” Quad-Core microprocessors are used per server. These Quad- 
Core processors are based on the Intel Bensley platform with Intel Clovertown 
processors technology. (4 processor cores per 2 physical processors in one server) 
A total of 16 processors cores are used in the twin ISIS server system. Processor 
speed is 2.66 GHz with a Front Side Bus (FSB) of 1,333 MHz. 

• 8 GB main memory ( FB-DIMM technology) is used in each server. 

• A six port SAS controller with RAID 5 and 256 MB battery-buffered cache. 

• Three 300 GB hot-plugged hard drives with 600 GB useable capacity. 

• Three additional hard drive slots are available for future expansion. 

• Dual Gbit/s Ethernet controller on board. 

• CD/DVD slim line drive technology. 

• Integrated LCD display for error and status messages. (LocalView Display) 

• Hot-plug PCIe expansion slots are available. 

• 8 Hot-plug and redundant cooling fans are used. (4 fans plus 4 redundant 
cooling fans per server.) 

• Two power supplies are used in each server. 

Having two rack servers in one system is for redundancy and backup. If one server fails, 
the other can take its place to prevent an interruption or downtime of the workshop sys¬ 
tems and personnel.

Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) 



“MGE Pulsar M 3000” UPS - (USV in German) 

A UPS unit is designed for power supply under voltage events. The UPS unit allows the 
ISIS servers to operate off the UPS internal batteries. While the line voltage is normal, 
the batteries get charged. When power fluctuates, only the charging circuit is affected. 
The batteries continue to provide power to the ISIS servers without interruption. 

Because the ISIS servers are constantly operating off the batteries of the UPS, the UPS 
also acts as a line conditioner. The internal UPS batteries provide DC power, and the 
ISIS servers dual power supplies run on AC power. Inside the UPS is a highly sensitive 
power inverter circuit that converts the DC into AC. 

UPS Battery Module 

The maintenance-free battery module of the UPS is a sealed unit. Six 12 volt DC batter¬ 
ies rated at 9 Ah using lead acid battery technology makes up this UPS maintenance- 
free battery module. Life span for this battery module is approximately 2 years. UPS bat¬ 
tery module must be changed out with fresh battery module to insure continuous under 
voltage protection. 

UPS Bridge Time 

The UPS bridge time (run time) is determined automatically based on the UPS configu¬ 
ration. In the event that an undervoltage condition is detected, the UPS will automatically 
send a power down command to the servers in order to safely shut the system down. 

The UPS unit is rated at 3000VA/2700 W.

Cabling 


The center/dealer is required to have a Cat 6 network cable running from the center’s 
Cisco 2960G or 3560G LAN switch to the ISIS HP ProCurve LAN Switch 1800-24. 
This cable can be connected into any of the open ports within the ISIS HP ProCurve 
LAN Switch range of 5 thru 18. 

Internal ISIS Rack Cabinet Cabling 

All internal Cat 6 cables are labeled. A cable man¬ 
agement system is used in the ISIS rack cabinet for 
controlled routing.
