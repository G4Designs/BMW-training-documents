Introduction to BMW 




BMW Model Identification 


BMW uses two different methods of identifying its products: 

• External Designations are for customers to identify BMW products. These are 
marketing designations commonly referred to as trunk badges. 

• Internal Designations are used by BMW and center personnel to identify a particular 
production version. 


External Designations 


External designations located on the 
trunk or tailgate are the model names. 

Customers and the public identify 
BMW products by these names. 

The trunk badges consist of a combination of numbers and letters. The badge shown is 
typical of 3, 5, and 7 series vehicles. The first digit represents the series identification. 
The last two digits mark the engine displacement. The i represents the type of fuel deliv¬ 
ery (injected). 

The external designations are created by the sales and marketing department to position 
each model in a certain target segment of the vehicle sales market. 



Occasionally there are examples where the actual engine displacement does not match 
the designation. This is a marketing decision to continue familiar name recognition from 
one version to the next and to create a spacing between models. Examples are: 


• 1996-2001 740i -4.4 liter 

• All 323i - 2.5 liter 

• 2005 750i/Li - 4.8 liter 



There is another series of badges that begin with a letter followed by a single digit. 
These are found on: 

• Roadsters (E36/7, E52, E85) 

• SAV (E53, E83) 

• Motorsport 

Additional letters sometime follow the badge numbers and are used to further identify 
each model. Examples include: 

• C or c - Coupe or Cabrio • i - Fuel Injected • s - sport 

• L - long wheel base • M - Motorsport • e - etta 

• x - all-wheel drive • t - touring/sports wagon • d - Diesel

Internal Designations 

Internal designations are created and used by the Engineering and Technical Develop¬ 
ment departments to identify a new model during the design of the car. The use of the 
internal designations carries over to the Technical Support groups after production. 

Internal designations refer to the entire vehicle series of a particular body design. For 
example, the E46 designation describes all 3 series cars of that design. BMW products 
start with an “E” and are followed by a two digit number. Not all design concepts make 
production, so internal designations are usually not sequential. Table 1.1 lists the internal 
designations, series number and the years produced. 

The E designations can include an additional number separated by a slash (/) to indicate 
a different model within a particular chassis group. Example: 


• E36/7-Z3 • E46/3-Sport Wagon • E46/16-All-Wheel Drive 

• E36/5- 318ti • E46/2-Coupe

VIN Location on Vehicle 

The VIN is located on the vehicle in the following locations: 

• Left lower corner of the instrument panel. This is viewed through the windshield 
from outside the vehicle. 

• B pillar compliance label. On the drivers side doorjamb. 

Additionally the VIN is stamped into the chassis in one of two locations: 

• Under the hood on right side of engine compartment bulkhead. 

• Under the hood on right side shock tower.

The production date of the vehicle is included in the B pillar compliance label. 

Production date information is required quite often when a repair procedure affects only 
a certain range of vehicles. The range is based on production dates. 

The date shown on the label reflects the actual month and year the vehicle was pro¬ 
duced. It is not a model year indicator.

Vehicle Production Anti-Theft Labels 

Since 1987, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requires that the 
VIN be marked on specific parts of the car during manufacture for theft identification. Some 
models are exempt if the total number of vehicles imported is below a certain number. 


If equipped, label it is also a reference point for the VIN. The label is placed on the follow¬ 
ing locations: 


Engine 

Hood 

Front bumper 
Front Fenders 
Quarter panels. 
Firewall 


Transmission 


Trunk li 


Rear Bumper 
Doors

Paint Code Identification 


When ordering painted parts it is necessary to obtain the vehicle’s paint code. The paint 
code consists of a three digit number printed on the color identification tag as shown 
below. All color identification tags are located in the engine compartment.

Engine Identification 

BMW engines are identified by a combined alpha-numeric code. Like the internal model 
designation it is a code used by the Engineering and Technical development teams dur¬ 
ing the design stages of the engine: 

• M - for standard production engines 

• S - for Motorsport engines (Motorsport is a separate division of BMW) 

• N -for New Generation engines 

• P - for Prototype engines 

After the letter there are two digits that identify the engine. The table below lists engines 
by number of cylinders. Please refer to the BMW Technical Information Card for individ¬ 
ual model application.

Engine Numbering System 

In order to organize and classify the engines developed by BMW, a numbering system 
has been developed. 


N46B20K0 

Digit 1 is the engine developer and/or generation: - 

A = Motorcycle 

M = BMW Group (Old Generation) 

N = BMW Group (New Generation) 

G H K LT= BMW Group (Future Generation) 

P = BMW Motorsport 
S = BMW M GmbH 

Digit 2 is the engine type: 

Combustion Engines 
2 = V6 

4 = in-line 4 

5 = in-line 6 

6 = V8 
7= VI2 
8 = V10 

Digit 3 is the engine technology: -

Introduction to BMW 



Engine Displacement Identification 

In technical literature usually only the group of 3 digits 
that follow the basic engine code is utilized for engine 
identification. These digits identify the required fuel 
type of the engine and it’s displacement. 


ENGINE CODE 


M54-B30 


30 = 3.0 LITER 
DISPLACEMENT 



B = BENZINE, GERMAN 
FOR GASOLINE 


Engine displacement can always be determined by the engine specification plate. 

This plate is stamped onto the engines in various locations. There is a lot of information 
included in this identification plate. The breakdown of the information on this plate is as 
follows:

Transmission Identification 


BMW uses three different transmission suppliers. 

1. Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen: A German supplier of BMW transmissions. 
Commonly referred to as ZF. ZF manufactures both manual and automatic trans¬ 
missions. 

2. Getrag: A German supplier of BMW manual transmissions. 

3. Hydramatic: A French supplier of BMW automatic transmissions. Hydramatic is a 
manufacturing division of General Motors Powertrain. 

BMW has developed an internal numbering system for their transmissions for parts 
ordering, information research, and identification. Each manufacturer uses their own 
internal identification system. 

The breakdown of the BMW transmission identification code is as follows: 

BMW Identification Code Breakdown 

A 5 S 440 Z 

Digit 1 is the transmission type: - 

A = Automatic 
S = Standard (manual) 

Digit 2 is the number of gears: -1 

Digit 3 is a reference for the final drive ratio: - 

S = Top gear overdrive 
D = Top gear direct drive 

Digits 4-6 are a torque rating index: - 

Digit 7 identifies the manufacturer: -<- 

Z = ZF 

R = Hydramatic 
G - Getrag
