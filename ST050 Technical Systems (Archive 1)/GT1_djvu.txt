Control Panel 


The control panel is the central component of the GT1. The operating system and the 
application programs are stored here. 



Located on the front of the Control Panel: 

- PCMCIA interface (radio card slot in 
left handle) 

- Monitor with touch capabilities 

- Control Block 

- Battery Compartment (in right handle) 


Monitor 

The surface of the monitor is covered by a touch-sensitive plastic sheet that senses the 
pressure of a finger or the touch pen and transfers it to the system. 

Note: Use only your finger or the touch pen supplied to operate the touch 
screen. If other objects are used, it may damage the GT1 Screen. 

Control Block 

The main control block of the GT1 control panel is located under the center of the touch¬ 
screen. It consists of 1 on/off switch, 3 LEDs and the infrared receiver port. The infrared 
port is the connection to the wireless keyboard used during programming. 

The On/Off switch is used to switch the control panel on and off or to initiate a forced 
switch-off. If a fault occurs that causes the unit to “lock-up”, you can shut down the unit 
by holding down the on/off button for 5 seconds. This may cause the loss of operating 
software, necessitating a reinstall (use only in an emergency). 

The status of the switch does not affect the charging operation.

The “temperature” LED will glow red when the control panel is overheated. The control 
panel will shut down approximately 10 seconds later. See the Owner’s Manual for restart 
procedures. 

The “battery” LED will glow yellow during charging. It will switch off to signify the battery 
is fully charged. It will flash yellow if excessive temperatures continue. 

The “operation” LED will glow green when using an external power source, glow orange 
when using the internal battery. A flashing orange LED signifies a discharged battery. 

Alternately flashing orange/green LED denotes that the internal battery is defective or has 
been removed.

Power Supply 


The control panel is supplied power from one of three voltage sources: 

• Internally from the battery (approximately 2.5 hours of operating time). 

• Externally from the bench power unit or the docking station. 

• Externally from the vehicle electrical system.

DVD Drive 


The DVD Drive is accessible from the top of the control panel. It accommodates DVD’s 
and CD-ROM’s for installing programs, applications or updates of the control panel. 



Note: When you open and close the DVD drive the control panel must be in the 14° 
inclination position as shown, otherwise the drive tray or the disc may be 
damaged. The suspension system for the drive is optimized for 14°. Do not 
use the DVD unless the control panel is attached to the docking station. 

Docking Station 

The Docking Station is intended for stationary operation, it replaces the bench power unit 
and provides the power supply. The Docking Station also provides the interfaces for con¬ 
nection to a USB device and the LAN Network.

Bench Power Unit 


As an alternative to the docking station, the bench power unit may be used to power the 
control panel. The bench power unit consists of the built in connecting cable on the con¬ 
trol panel, the power unit itself and a separate power cable. When the control panel 
receives power from the bench power unit, the internal battery is simultaneously 
charged. 

Optical Keyboard 

The keyboard uses an Infrared link to communicate with the GT1 control panel. It is used 
only for service programs and can not be used in place of the virtual keyboard of the con¬ 
trol panel. The keyboard must always face the control panel when in use and must be 
less than 1 meter away from the control panel (IR). The keyboard uses 4 AA batteries as 
an internal power supply. 



CAUTION!!! 


Old batteries can leak and damage the keyboard. Always 
keep fresh batteries in the keyboard (or remove when not 
in use). 


If more than one GT1 is in use in the workshop, the optical keyboard should be config¬ 
ured to a specific GT 1 control panel as follows: 

1. Press and hold the identification key while pointing the keyboard at the control panel. 

2. Press a numeric key, 0-7 on the keyboard. The control panel will now respond only 
to commands from that keyboard. 

If necessary the identification can be changed at anytime following the above instructions.

LAN Control Panel Cable (Crossed) 

The LAN control panel adapter (crossed) is approximately 30 cm long with a RJ45 con¬ 
nector and a RJ45 socket. It is identified by a black (yellow on early units) stripe near the 
socket and a label reading “LAN Adapter BTX.” This crossed cable is needed to be able 
to communicate between the diagnostic head and the GT1.

2. Nine Pin Interface (For Future Use) 


The vehicle battery adapter cable is used while in the vehicle as a power supply for the 
GT1. This cable does not charge the GT1 ’s internal battery. 



Ammeter Clamp with Adapter 

The ammeter clamp and adapter can be used to measure the amperage of a circuit 
inductively. There are two amperage clamp available: one measures up to 50 amps, the 
other up to 1000 amps. 



13 

Group Tester One 









Battery 

Power is supplied by the integrated battery when the control panel is not connected to an 
external power source. The battery must be charged to insure uninterrupted use of the 
control panel as a mobile test unit. The battery is charged automatically as soon as the 
control panel is placed in the docking station or connected to the bench power supply. 
While the battery is being charged the “Battery” LED illuminates in yellow. 

To achieve the longest possible service life for the integrated battery, it must be fully 
charged, then discharged for normal use. Once a month the battery should be “formed” 
which entails fully discharging the battery, then fully recharging it. 

To “form” the battery: 

• Disconnect the bench power unit from the control panel or undock from the docking 
station or disconnect the docking station from a power source. 

• Fully discharge the battery, by leaving the control panel “ON” until all the LEDs are 
out. 

• Dock the control panel or supply power to the docking station or connect the bench 
power unit. 

Charging is complete when the “Battery” LED goes out. 

Note: Always replace a defective battery with a new battery. Never operate the 
control panel with out a battery (it acts as a buffer). Sudden interruption of 
power my cause the control panel to loose the installed operating system. 


Replacing the Battery 

1. Switch off power and undock control panel. 

2. Remove screw on right hand handle. 

3. Pull off handle. 

4. Remove battery. 

5. Press down on the retainer for the connector 
and carefully remove connector. 

6. Connect new battery. 

7. Insert new battery in handle. 

8. Reinstall handle on control panel. 

9. Completely charge new battery.

Measurements Interface Box (MIB) 


The MIB was developed to expand the basic measurement capabilities and functions of 
the GT1 to the level of the DISplus. 


The MIB contains all of the components necessary for acquiring static and dynamic 
signals, generating stimulation signals as well as complex measurements. The MIB 
collects the signals directly from the vehicle, processes them and transfers them to 
the diagnosis system for analysis. 


The MIB is connected to the GT1 via the new MIB-GT1 connection cable. The GT1 
automatically recognizes if the MIB is connected when "Measuring System" is selected. 
When the Measuring System is selected the "Ready" light on the MIB will light. 



The following items are included with the MIB when delivered:

GT1 Trolley 

The GT1 Trolley was developed so that all of the GT1 peripheral pieces could be safely 
stored and close at hand for quick use. This includes the Measurement Interface Box (MIB) 
and associated cables. The GT1 trolley will remain viable for future workshop systems.

The GT1 Trolley stores the following peripherals for quick access: 

1. GT1 storage shelf - the GT 1 locks onto the shelf to protect it from falling. 

2. MIB storage shelf - uses a Velcro strap for protection. 

3. Storage drawer for keyboard. 

4. Deutronic battery charger storage shelf. 

5. Storage drawer for MFKand LAN cables. 

6. Storage bracket for the OPPS/OPS head, (not used for MINI) 

7. Storage bracket for the GT 1 head. 

8. Storage hooks for the MIB cables. 

Utilization Notes: 

• Never push the trolley by the top cable rack. Always push it by the grey curved 
handles. 

• Take the time to run the cables neatly the first time. Time spent here will save you 
time during usage. 

• The test cables are run up behind shelf (1) and hung from the test cable rack (8). 

• Power cables for the GT 1 and MIB are run down behind shelves 2 and 4. A power 
strip can be installed behind drawer 5 and the power cable run out through the 
opening in the back of the trolley. 

• A Deutronic battery charger can be placed on shelf 4. The cables are stored in 
drawer 5 when not in use. 

• Take care to properly replace all cables when finished. Proper cable storage saves 
everyone time and money.
