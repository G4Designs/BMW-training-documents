Introduction 


The Integrated Service Information Display (ISID) is a powerful display and operating 
unit for the workshop and vehicle reception. With numerous functions for diagnosis 
and programming. It replaces the Displus and GT1. 



The ISID will be used for: 

• Diagnosing vehicles (together with connected ISIS server and vehicle interface 
ICOM). 

• Programming vehicles (together with connected ISIS server and vehicle interface 
ICOM). 

• Conducting measurements of currents, voltages, pressures, temperatures and 
recording measurement plots (together with connected ISIS server and intelligent 
Measurement and Interface Box IMIB). 

• Accessing repair manuals and technical information regarding vehicles.

Unpacking and Setting up of the ISID Unit 


The ISID is delivered in (2) two separate cardboard boxes. One box has all the acces¬ 
sories for the ISID and the other cardboard box has the ISID unit with docking station. 




Accessories Package ISID with Docking Station Package 

The packaging consists of a box with a cardboard insert. The operating unit and 
docking station are additionally packed in foam parts. Unpack the accessories, 
docking station and operating unit. Remove the protective film from the operating 
unit and docking station. 

Installing of the AC Voltage Adapter (for Docking Station) 



Power cable routing 


Mounting of the AC power adapter 


Place the docking station carefully on the left side with the covering flap open. Route 
the power supply plug through the opening on the side and place the cable in the 
lateral recess. Only use the supplied power cable and the supplied power supply unit. 

Set up the docking station again and connect the power cable to the power supply 
unit. Place the power supply unit in the designated bracket. Connecting the power 
cable and inserting the power supply unit. Three cable mushrooms are provided to 
route the low-voltage cable. Route the cable first between the power supply unit and 
the two upper cable mushrooms and then between the two left cable mushrooms so 
that the filter fits in the tray. Connect the low-voltage cable to the DC socket of the 
docking station.

Connecting the Workshop LAN Cable to the Docking Station 

Connect the network cable to the RJ45 socket. Make sure the guide lug is pointing 
downward and the plug clicks audibly into place. Connect the other end of the network 
cable to the workshop network. Details on cabling in the workshop can be taken from the 
information provided in the “BMW NA Workshop Standards 2008” network infra¬ 
structure document. 



Docking station terminal strip (arrow pointing to RJ45 port) 


Close the covering flap. There is a large recess at the center of the cover to guide out the 
cables and prevent the device from being set down on them. 

Installing the Rechargeable Battery Pack 



Insert the rechargeable battery pack in the operating unit. The side with the sticker (label) 
points in the direction of the screen. Push it in until it engages firmly. 


WARNING!!! 


Battery must be charged for at least 2 to 3 hours before 
using or installing operating system software !

Installing the ISID unit onto the Docking Station 



Inserting the operating unit in the docking station 


Place the operating unit in the docking station. To do so, the operating unit must be 
hooked into the upper side of the bracket. Then press the bottom of the operating 
unit gently onto the bracket until it engages audibly. 

The device is now ready to be switched on. 


Kensington Lock 


There is a recess for connection of a mechanical anti-theft protection in the form of a 
Kensington lock. The product designation “Kensington lock” is an anti-theft device for 
mobile hardware such as notebooks, etc., originally manufactured by the Kensington 
Company. The designation has established itself as the expression for locks that work 
according to this principle. 


Devices that can be secured by means of a Kensington lock have an opening of around 
3x7 mm at the housing where the lock is inserted when the device is open. The lock 
mechanism in the form of a T-shaped coupling is locked into the opening by a 90° twist. 
The lock is usually equipped with a wire cable that has an eyelet at the end. The wire 
cable can be wrapped around an anchoring point and fixed in place.
