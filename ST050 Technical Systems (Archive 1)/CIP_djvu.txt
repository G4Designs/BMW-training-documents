Fundamentals of Coding and Programming 


What is Coding? 


It is a process utilized by BMW, which groups system specific operating requirements 
(Data) together and then assigns a label/code to each of these groups of data. The 
various groups of data are all pre-loaded into system specific “codable” control modules, 
along with a basic set of operating instructions (Program). 


Types of operating requirements: 

• Nominal values of device input signals (0.25V to 2.5V, 5W - 25W,...) 

• Type of device input signal (PWM, square wave, analog ...) 

• Operational parameters (device activation/deactivation time,...) 

• Market specific operations (02 Sensors, Fuel Type, Emission Control,...) 

• Country Specific Regulations (U.S., Canada, Japan, UK, ECE,...) 

• Powertrain Configurations (Manual, Auto, Diesel,...) 


BEFORE CODING 


AFTER CODING 




Coding allows a specific 
set of data already present 
in the module to be selected. 



[ 


The procedure of assigning one specifically labeled group of data to the operating 
program of a specific control module/component is referred to as “coding”. 


A “codable” control module has a basic operating program already installed along with 
several specific variations of operating data. The coding process allows a specific set of 
operating data to be assigned to the basic operating program of that module/component, 
with respect to its specific application. 


4 

Coding, Individualization & Programming 




































































































































































































































Coding can be performed for some systems/components: 

• Selecting customer specific system operational settings from a list of available fea¬ 
tures (VKM) 

• Automatically by selecting a specific coding process available via ZCS Coding or CIP 
using the DISplus/GTI/SSS. 

• By using a coded ground wire to a module. 

• Determined at the factory. 

Note: Codable control modules/components are system specific, which means 
that not all control modules are codable. 

What is Programming? 

It is a process utilized by BMW to load application/system specific operating instructions 
(Program) into a module/component which already has the systems operating require¬ 
ments (Data) installed, plus it can be used as a means of updating data and operating 
instructions previously installed in a control module. 


BEFORE PROGRAMMING 


AFTER PROGRAMMING 




Programming loads control 
functions instructions into 
a specific control module. 



Basic programmable control modules have a pre-defined set of operating data already 
installed which allows the module to be fairly generic until a specific operational program 
is installed. 

Programming of system control modules is performed using a DISplus/GTI/SSS. 


5 

Coding, Individualization & Programming 









































































































Note: Programmable control modules are system specific and not all control 
modules are programmable using workshop equipment like the 
DISplus,GT1 or SSS. The ability to program a module is limited to the 
number of times it has already been programmed and the hardware 
version of the control module itself. 

What is the Purpose of Coding and Programming? 

As a global manufacturer, BMW must design a large variety of control modules to meet 
numerous vehicle requirements pertaining to issues such as: 

• Country Specific Regulations (U.S., Canada, Japan, UK, ECE,...) 

• Vehicle Equipment Level (Phone, Navigation, HiFi, IHKA, IHKR,...) 

• Vehicle Powertrain Configurations (Manual, Auto,...) 

• System Specific Operating Requirements (Nominal values, type of input signal,...) 

By using Coding and/or Programming, the large variety of control modules needed can be 
reduced to a smaller number of model specific hardware variations. 

Codable control modules contain: 

• A common operating program 

• A large number/variety of specific operating data groups 

In order to use this type of control module it must first be CODED to ensure that the 
operating data specific to that vehicle/model application is used by the operating program 
of the control module. 

Programmable control modules contain: 

• The required/specific operational data 

• No operating program 

In order to use this type of control module it must first be PROGRAMMED to ensure that 
the operating program specific to the vehicle/model application is used. 

Prior to the availability of Coding and Programming in the workshop this task could only 
be performed at the factory. 

Initially the factory installed Control Module(s) with a common operating program or data 
into vehicles and as theses vehicles reached various points in the assembly process the 
control modules were updated with the required operating data or program specific to 
the application for that particular vehicle. Since replacement parts always need to be 
available, parts inventory needed to contain all variations of preprogrammed control 
modules installed in all varieties of vehicles that were manufactured. This was not a big 
problem in the early years, when the variety/quantity of models was smaller. 


6 

Coding, Individualization & Programming 


As the number of control modules and the complexity of the various systems installed 
into vehicles increased, the number of modules that needed to be stored in parts invento¬ 
ry began to increase as well. Eventually this led to the stocking of hundreds of different 
control modules that were either pre-programmed or pre-coded for a specific application 
and model, but only differed slightly in the way they were coded or programmed. 

Pre-programmed and pre-coded control modules always needed to be available in the 
event a control module failed once the vehicle left the factory floor, since this was the only 
place programming & coding procedures could be performed. In order for repairs to be 
made quickly, dealers were required to maintain a stock of several varieties of control 
modules, since technicians could only remove the failed module and installed a new pre¬ 
programmed or pre-coded module into the vehicle. 

As a result of having to maintain a very large inventory of pre-programmed and pre-coded 
control modules in parts inventory, it was decided to make coding and eventually pro¬ 
gramming available in BMW workshops. 



The following advantages have occurred since programming and coding can be per¬ 
formed in the workshop: 

• Fewer control module hardware versions are needed (only need basic control 
modules) 

• Lower parts and inventory costs 

• Able to update software in a control module without having to replace the module 
(Re-Code/ Re-Program to address service Measures) 

• Ability to add special equipment features to existing control modules (DWA, Day 
Time Running Lights,...) 

• Customization of vehicle operation (Conversions, VKM, A/C,...) 


7 

Coding, Individualization & Programming 





































































































































































The means by which coding or programming information is provided to a control module 
varies and is determined by the vehicle, model year and type of module(s) installed. 

BMW currently uses the following methods to perform Coding or Programming: 

• Coding Plug 

• DME variant Coding 

• Coding Code 

• Central Coding Key (ZCS) or Vehicle Order (VO) 

• EPROM Programming 

• Flash Programming 

• Vehicle and Key Memory (VKM) 

Where is Data Stored in a Control Module? 


The control modules used in our vehicles store data/information on one of the following: 

• EPROM (Electrically Programmable Read Only Memory) 

• EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) 

in essence these devices are similar to the hard drive of the PC (Personal Computer) that 
many of us use daily to store the images and documents/files of information. 


EPROM (Electrically Programmable Read Only Memory) 

An EPROM is a computer memory chip that can be electrically programmed, however 
this chip cannot be erased using normal means. 

In order to erase data that is stored on the chip it must be removed from the device and 
exposed to UV lighting for a specific time period. An EPROM has what is commonly 
called a “window” on the top portion of the chip usually located underneath a protective 
label, it is this area that must be exposed to UV light of a certain intensity for a specific 
time period in order to erase the information stored on it. 


BMW does not currently utilize EPROMS on current vehicles.

EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) 

An EEPROM is a computer memory chip that can be electrically programmed and 
electrically erased, thereby not requiring the chip to be removed from the module or 
exposed to light. In general this chip is not easily removable from the device it is 
installed into (it is usually soldered in its place. 

Since the entire process of programming and erasing is done electronically this device 
is commonly referred to as “Flash Programmable”. 

During the programming process the following type of information may be loaded into 
the control module depending on the specific application or update that needs to be 
installed: 

• Characteristic Maps (Ex. Ignition, Injection, Purge Control, DSC Regulation,...) 

• Control Constants/ Operational Data 

• Operational Program 

• Control Module Identification Information (Ex. Hardware Number, Program Number, 
Date of Modification,...) 

At this moment, modules with EEPROMS can only be flash programmed (“flashed”), 
can only 14 times total. If the module has to be programmed a 15 th time, it has to be 
replaced. 

What is needed to Code and Program? 

In order to code or program a vehicle or control in the workshop, specific equipment and 
special software is required such as a DISplus, GT1 and an SSS which must all be con¬ 
nected to a network and have the must current version of CIP (Coding, Individualization & 
Programming) installed. CIP is the software program that contains all the latest data and 
program information to allow control modules to be updated to the latest level to address 
customer concerns and implement service solutions. 

With the release of CIP 14.0 and the implementation of Progman (see Progman section 
for additional information) the DISplus and GT1 will only be capable of performing vehicle 
diagnosis and activation/initiation of a Coding, Individualization or Programming task 
through the SSS. A special program management tool (Progman) will only allow the 
DISplus and GT1 to act as remote terminals to the SSS (regarding Coding, 
Individualization & Programming), which means that the SSS will be the single supplier of 
Coding, Individualization and Programming information to a vehicle and its respective 
control modules.

Vehicle Coding Information 


Introduction 

As part of an ongoing process to reduce the need for country, model and option specific 
control modules, BMW utilizes a multi digit vehicle coding structure referred to as a 
Central Coding Key (ZCS). 

The Central Coding Key (ZCS) is a unique 37 digit code that contains specific model, 
country variation and individual equipment/option information for a vehicle. 


GM 16430000P 
SA 0000422005009CC0U 
VN 000001El16K 


During the manufacturing process of a vehicle, the ZCS code is created to identify the 
specific vehicle being built and to properly code the control modules installed during the 
assembly process once the vehicle reaches the end of the line. To ensure that the ZCS 
code can be retrieved once the vehicle leaves the factory it is stored in two control mod¬ 
ules, the cluster and the EWS. 

ZCS is often referred to as a “key” since it is able to automatically “unlock” or ’’activate” 
specific functions of a new control module or can be used to recode a used control 
module to be compatible with the specific vehicle it has been installed into. With the 
introduction of the E31 the ZCS information was used for the first time as a coding key 
for replacement vehicle control modules, this ensured that the replacement modules 
would be coded to the required specification of the vehicle. 

These codeable modules have no limit as to the number of times that they can be 
recoded. 


11 

Coding, Individualization & Programming 







ZCS Structure 


The 37 digit structure of the ZCS is subdivided 
into three segments. The segments represent 
specific information about the vehicle. 

Each segment ends with a checksum “digit”. 

A checksum is utilized by the coding software to 
detect unacceptable/erroneous manually entered 
coding information. 

The information/digits of the ZCS code reflects the options installed in the vehicle and 
should never be changed manually unless it is necessary for special recoding functions 
such as: 

• Canadian market vehicle being moved to the US 

• Retrofit installation of an accessory system (ie. alarm or satellite radio) 

For extreme cases; If a modification needs to be made to the ZCS structure and there is 
no information available in a service bulletin then the Technical Hotline should be con¬ 
tacted for assistance by submitting a PUMA case, requesting a modified ZCS code. 

Each portion of the ZCS provides specific information regarding that vehicle: 

GM (Grundmerkmale) - Identifies the “Basic Features” of the vehicle and contains 9 dig¬ 
its that are used to describe: 

• Vehicle type (R50, R52, R53 ...) 

• Specific body style of the vehicle (Convertible, Coupe ...) 

• Country specific coding identification (US, UK, ECE ...) 

• Unique equipment that affects the basics of the vehicle (with 
sunroof, without sunroof, wheel size ...) 

• Basic language variant (English, Spanish, German ...) 

SA (Sonderausstattungs) - Identifies the “Special Equipment” of the vehicle and contains 

17 digits that describe what features/functions are installed in 
the vehicle, such as: 

• Power Windows or Manual windows 

• Power Door Locks or Manual Door Locks 

• Power Sunroof or Manual Sunroof 

• Power Convertible Top or Manual Convertible Top 

• Satellite Pre-wire 

The SA segment is configured to provide a total of 64 possible number combinations 
(option groups) for all series vehicles worldwide. The information is modified whenever a 
new component/accessory is added to the vehicle via a retrofit coding procedure.

Coding, Individualization & Programming 





VN (Versionsnummer) - Identifies the “Version Number” of the vehicle and contains 11 

digits that are used to describe: 

• Series specific coding data that are not reflected in the GM or 
SA segments. This includes, model year dependent data, 
software and hardware versions of the control modules 
installed, coding instructions, etc. 

The VN is displayed as 40 possible combinations of digits. A deliberate change in the 
VN will result in erroneous coding data being used when recoding a module or coding a 
replacement module which will affect the proper operation of a control module(s) coded 
with an incorrect VIN. 


FOUR DIGIT PORTION REPRESENTS VEHICLE BODY AND SPECIFIC BODY EQUIPMENT 
(COUPE, SEDAN, ROADSTER, SUNROOF, ETC,) 

There are 4096 possible combinations of digits per model.

ZCS Stored Location in Vehicle 

The ZCS is stored in the vehicle to simplify the coding procedures when a module needs 
to be recoded or a replacement module needs to be coded. Depending on the vehicle, 
the ZCS information is stored in the following locations:

* The E46 switched to a Vehicle Order (VO) data structure in 9/01. 


The procedure to code control modules that utilize the ZCS information can be per¬ 
formed via the DISplus/GT 1 or SSS using Progman with CIP 15.0 or higher and access¬ 
ing the “Codierung ZCS/FA” function. Always reference service bulletins for information 
regarding the latest coding version and any possible software errors. 

When coding a ZCS codable control module the coding program in CIP automatically 
searches the stored location, based on the VIN, and codes the selected module accord¬ 
ing to the information provided in the ZCS code. 

On later production vehicles the ZCS information began to be stored in two locations, 
referred to as redundant data storage, this insures that the information is always available 
in the event the primary device storing the data fails. 

Note: On early production vehicles without redundant data storage, if the mod¬ 
ule being coded or recoded is the module that stores the ZCS informa¬ 
tion, then the vehicles ZCS information must be obtained from the label 
located on the vehicle or electronically accessed from the module and 
printed out then entered manually via the input screen on DISplus/GTI 
or SSS. 


For vehicles with redundant data storage the coding of the module stor¬ 
ing the data is performed automatically using the information stored in 
the “back up” module.

Vehicle Order 

In 9/01 the ZCS vehicle data structure on the E46 was replaced with what is referred to 
as the Vehicle Order (VO) or Fahrzeugauftrag (FA). The vehicle order structure is utilized 
on all new models introduced/produced as of 9/01. such as E65/66, E60, E63/64, E83, 
E85 etc. Models such as E36, E39, E52, and E53 produced after 9/01 continued to be 
manufactured using the ZCS structure until production of the model is complete.

The vehicle order format contains information pertaining to the production of a specific 
vehicle such as: 

Series Type - (E46, E65, E60, etc.) 

Time Criterion - Identifies date the options/hardware equipment available for installation 

into the vehicle was standardized/”locked”. This information does not 
refer to the production date of the vehicle. A problem with coding or 
programming may occur if a module or option based on a newer or 
older time criterion date is installed into the vehicle. 

Model Code (Basic Type) - Base level from which the vehicle is “created/built”. 

Paint Code - Identifies the color of the vehicle at time of production. 

Upholstery Code - Identifies the type of upholstery installed in the vehicle at time of 

production. 

Assembly Number - Identifies the programmed part number for powertrain (Not used) 

E-Wort - Identifies additions/options added to the vehicle that are not part of standard 
SA codes/options 

HO-Wort - Identifies options installed at Center/Dealer using 3 digit option code 

(Currently not used.) 

Installed Option/SA Codes - Listing of accessories & equipment options installed in 

the vehicle. 

The information contained in the vehicle order is used to identify the module(s)/system(s) 
that are/should be installed in the vehicle and also what if any control modules need to be 
updated if a new system/option is added or removed to/from the vehicle to ensure proper 
compatibility with the devices installed in the vehicle. The information contained in the 
vehicle order such as installed options, is modified whenever a new component (mod¬ 
ule/system) is installed and coded to the vehicle. If the new component is not properly 
coded to the vehicle the SA listing is not updated and problems can be encountered 
whenever a measures plan for the vehicle is created, vehicle needs to be recoded or 
VKM/Individualization functions are to be modified. 

A listing of the components that need to be updated is provided whenever a measures 
plan is generated (refer to CIP module for additional information).

Control Modules Flash (EEPROM) Programming 


An EEPROM is an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory chip that 
is soldered onto the circuit board of a control module. This signifies that programs & 
data stored on the chip can be electrically erased and replaced with new/revised 
programs or data. 

In order to erase the data on the chip a short duration low level voltage/charge is applied 
to a pin on the EEPROM and the stored data is erased, hence the name “Flash”. Once 
the data is erased new data is loaded. 

By using a this technology, control modules have the ability to be updated a total of 13 
times before they need to be replaced. 

Theoretically an EEPROM can be erased and reprogrammed more than 13 times, BMW 
set the number to 13, since a point will be reached where the update being installed 
may no longer be compatible with the hardware of the installed module which could 
result in erroneous operation. If the program is not compatible with the hardware version 
of the module, the program used to determine the correct update for the module will 
indicate that the module will need to be replaced before the update can be performed. 

The reference to Flash programming is a result of the technology used to erase the 
EEPROM prior to installing a new program and or data. 

The utilization of EEPROMs started with Engine Management Systems and has 
expanded into other control modules. 

Determination Process for DME EEPROM 

The CIP program is used to determine the correct replacement part numbers (Control 
Module or software update) to be installed. 

For modules that utilize EEPROMs/Flash programming the determination process is 
done automatically as part of determining a measures plan.

Coding, Individualization & Programming 


Introduction 

With the introduction of the E65 in 2001, BMW not only introduced a vehicle loaded 
with the latest technology but also introduced a new way of performing vehicle coding 
and programming. In order to code and program an E65, a software program commonly 
referred to as CIP was introduced. The acronym CIP stands for Coding, Individualization 
& Programming and with the introduction of Progman & CIP 15.0 it has become the 
sole software tool for coding and programming vehicles. 

Initially CIP was developed for use on the E65/E66 and newer models but has since 
been expanded to include all vehicles produced prior to the introduction of the E65 that 
utilize a an SGC/UNIX programming structure. 

The intention of the CIP program is to insure that whenever a module is updated or 
replaced it will still be compatible with all the other modules installed in the vehicle 
(equipped with a MOST bus). Since all of the communication between the various mod¬ 
ules installed in a vehicle is over a bus network structure, it is very important that all of 
the installed modules be able to communicate with each other without problems. 

To ensure compatibility/seamless integration between control modules, the CIP software 
reads out the part numbers of all the control modules installed in the vehicle as well as 
the software levels of the respective modules. The information from the various installed 
modules is then cross referenced against a “master reference list” to determine if a mod- 
ule(s) needs to be updated and how this update will effect the other installed modules. 
Once this cross reference process is started it can result in additional issues such as: 

• If the software level in a selected module is updated will the hardware of the module 
still be able to function correctly. 

• If the software to be installed is not going to be compatible with the installed hard¬ 
ware then the module will need to be replaced. 

• If updated software is installed in the selected module will this have any impact on 
any other installed modules and will they need to have the software updated or will 
the hardware need to be updated in additional modules in order to install the 
revised software. 

Example: A desktop computer originally built with a Pentium I, 75 Mhz processor 

using Windows 95 is not able to operate using Windows 2000. In order to 
operate with Windows 2000 this old desktop computer needs to upgraded 
with new hardware. However, a desktop computer designed to operate with 
Windows 2000 can be updated to Windows XP without having to upgrade 
the hardware of the computer. 


21 

Coding, Individualization & Programming 






All hardware devices that utilize software/programs to operate can only have the installed 
software updated a certain number of times before the operating capacity of the installed 
hardware is exceeded and no longer compatible, this results in the device no longer being 
able to function. In order for these devices to continue to operate the installed 
hardware/control modules will need to be updated, which is what happens in our vehicles 
or desktop computers over time. 

Specific information pertaining to coding and programming with CIP are provided in 

SIB 09 05 01. 

Integration Levels 

All new models produced as of the E65 have a minimum allowable software level, based 
on production date, which is referred to as an integration level or data status. The inte¬ 
gration level defines the software level that all the control modules installed into a particu¬ 
lar model, at time of production, must be at in order to ensure compatibility. Once an 
integration level for a specific production period is defined/“locked”, the modules installed 
in those vehicles can not be updated beyond that level. 

The Integration level or data status for vehicles equipped with a most bus is provided in 
the “Status report” or “Measures plan” as shown below. 

Vehicle data status: E060-04-09-503 

Target data status: E060-04-09-555 

If the vehicle data status and target data status are not the same, this indicates that some 
of the installed control modules need to be updated to bring the vehicle up to the latest 
level. 

If the software levels were not locked it would be quite complex to track all software and 
hardware variations for all models through all production ranges. It would be extremely 
difficult to determine what software and hardware level is compatible with each module 
installed in a specific vehicle(s) and exactly what needs to be updated if one module is 
updated or replaced, therefore a limit or locked point must be define for specific produc¬ 
tion periods by model. 

Example: MY2002 vehicles can not be programmed with software that is assigned to 

MY2003 vehicles since the defined integration level for each Model Year is 
different. Similarly Windows 2000 can not be installed & operated on a com¬ 
puter originally developed to run with Windows 95. 

Information contained in this module is for reference as a user guide, more detailed infor¬ 
mation can be obtained from the respective Service Information Bulletins 

SI B09 05 01 & SI B09 03 98.

Measures Plan 


A measures plan is generated by CIP to identify what if any control modules need to be 
updated in order to bring a vehicle up to the latest integration level or data status. The 
measures plan also identifies the part number of the old/installed programmed control 
module and also what the new part number will be after the update is performed.

A measures plan identifies the programmed 
part number for the control module(s) 
installed: 

• “Old part no. progr. Ctrl, mod.” - indicates 
p/n for software currently installed. 

• “New part no. progr. Ctrl, mod.” - indicates 
the p/n if the module is updated, by 
accepting the displayed measures plan the 
module will be updated to the new num¬ 
ber and software. 

Note: The “update” does not need to be 
performed if the two part num¬ 
bers are the same. 


On vehicles without a MOST-Bus, a “Measures plan” provides information on updates 
that are available for the selected control module. By selecting accept, only the module 
listed in the measures plan will be updated. 


Note: Prior to selecting accept, printout a copy of the measures plan and 
attach it to the repair order to document the work performed. 


Important!!! 


If the measures plan identifies any control modules that will 
need to be replaced exit CIP. 


For additional information pertaining to programming using CIP refer to SI B090501.

CKM - Individualization (Vehicle & Key Memory)

The CKM feature contained in CIP (for models produced as of the E65) provides the abil¬ 
ity to “customize” certain vehicle and key functions to meet the specific preferences of 
the customer. It is important to note that the functions/features that can be “customized” 
vary depending on model, equipment level and vehicle software level. 


Upon selecting “CKM” a check of the current vehicle and key settings is made and dis¬ 
played. The displayed settings list should be printed out and provided to the customer in 
order for them to select how the available functions should be set . The CKM function 
contained within CIP allows settings for both vehicle and keys to be made directly, the 
older version separates the key settings from the vehicle setting as different functions.

ZCS Coding Procedure 

The ZCS coding procedure can currently be performed with the DISplus using DIS CDs 
until DIS CD 42 is released at which time all SGC/Unix coding and programming func¬ 
tions will be available only via Progman using the GT1 orSSS. 

There are two methods of encoding replacement control modules: 

• Manual input of ZCS 

• Automatic ZCS retrieval and coding 

Coding Control Modules that Store the ZCS 

On earlier production vehicles when replacing a control module that stores the ZCS code 
(i.e Kombi?lnstrument Cluster) the information must be entered manually in order to code 
the replacement module. The ZCS code from the label located in the vehicle or a print¬ 
out of the code stored in the module to be replaced must be entered into the new mod¬ 
ule. 

The control modules that store the ZCS and require manual input are: 

• IKE-E38 

• EKM-E31 

• Instrument Cluster - E32/34 (After 9-91) & E36 (except 318ti and Z3 Roadster) 

• EWS II - 318ti & Z3 Roadster 

Note: As long as the defective EWS II control module can communicate with 
the coding equipment, automatic encoding is possible. 

On later production vehicles where the ZCS information is stored in two modules, redun¬ 
dant data storage, the ZCS information to code the replacement module can be obtained 
from the second/backup module. 

Vehicles which have redundant ZCS data storage are: 

• E36 (Z3) - Instrument Cluster & EWS II as of 9/98 

• E39 - Instrument Cluster & EWS II 

• E46 - Instrument Cluster & LSZ 

• E53 - Instrument Cluster & LSZ 

Note: E46 changed from ZCS to a Vehicle Order (VO/FA) vehicle data structure 
in 9/01.

Retrofit 

The retrofit function allows options or accessory equipment to be added after the vehicle 
is manufactured. 

By selecting to install a new option/accessory from the list of available retrofits for the spe¬ 
cific vehicle, the ZCS information will be updated to reflect the addition of the new option 
or accessory that was installed. Updating of the ZCS information will ensure that the new
