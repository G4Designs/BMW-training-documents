After completion of this module you will be able to: 

• Understand the process that enables PuMA to be successful 

• Understand the information expected in a PuMA case 

• Review and understand what makes a “good” PuMA case 

• Understand the different documents that can be generated from PuMA 

• Understand the importance of the FASTA data transfer with respect to PuMA

Product and Measures Management Aftersales (PuMA) 
















Introduction 


Product and Measures Management Aftersales (PuMA) is the preferred method of 
communicating service issues that may be encountered at the centers. As of February 
2005 PuMA is the only method of first contact with the technical hotline department. 

There are four major components of information utilized by PuMA. 

These four components are: 

QC Info 

Quality Control Information report (Pink Sheet) is created by the technician when 
informing BMWNA of a quality issue. Information included in these reports is used 
by the engineering department to identify and resolve product issues. Create a QC 
Info when a response through PuMA is not expected. 

Case 

Cases are created by the technician and forwarded to the Hotline. The Hotline 
responds to the Case with a recommendation. The Case will appear in your Mailbox 
with a green diamond which alerts you to the response. Only users at the center 
where the Case originated will be able to see and read the Case and the Hotline’s 
response. Cases expire after 90 days. 

Report 

Reports are compiled by the BMW Group when similar Cases are identified. These 
Reports are forwarded to BMW AG and used in the problem solving process. Center 
personnel are not able to read Reports. 

Measure 

Measures are solutions or steps to be applied to a known problem. Measures are 
typically a response to a problem identified in a Report. To avoid duplication, and to 
offer technicians a single system to search for technical information, Measures are 
released as Service Information Bulletins as of July 2005. Service Measures released 
prior to July 2005 can also be searched along with Service Information Bulletins on 
the TIS website.

Service Information 


This module is not meant to be an owner’s manual for PuMA but rather explain the 
process behind PuMA. Technicians should already familiar with the interface used in 
PuMA and how to submit PuMA cases. 

Procedure 

The Technical Hotline was established to assist center technicians who are faced with 
difficult to diagnose technical problems. In order to provide proper service to all centers, 
the following points must be adhered to before contacting the Technical Hotline: 

• The technician assigned to the vehicle must have training directly related to the 
vehicle or system. 

• All available resources must be reviewed; these include but are not limited to: 
Service Information Bulletins, Service Measures, TIS, DCS messages, Service 
Round Table, Training manuals, Repair Manual Instructions, DIS Functional 
Descriptions. Refer to attached Technical Protocol for more details. 

• Reguired checks must be performed. For example, diagnostic test plans, verifying 
circuit integrity, power and grounds, and reviewing vehicle service history. Refer to 
attached Technical Protocol for more details. 

• The Shop Foreman / Team Leader must be consulted. 

• Do not contact Technical Hotline if vehicle is not in shop/on property and has not 
been evaluated using diagnostic eguipment (DIS/GT1). 

• Your diagnostic tester must have FASTA switched on in order to aid the Technical 
Hotline Specialist in diagnosis. For more information on FASTA, refer to SI B07 07 01. 

• Do not contact the Technical Hotline for Warranty approval (other than for automatic 
transmission replacement). Contact your Market Team where reguired by the 
Warranty Policies & Procedures Manual. 

• Do not contact the Technical Hotline for Parts information. The Parts Consultant 
Group should be contacted by your Parts department at (800) 272-0202. 

• Do not contact the Technical Hotline for radio security codes. You can obtain the 
security codes through DCS or faxing in your reguest to 201 930 8424 as per SI 
B65 05 99. 

• If you wish to inform us of a guality issue, and no technical assistance is reguired, 
please utilize PuMA to submit a QC Info (Pink Sheet). 

Note: PuMA cases not fulfilling the following rules will be rejected and 
returned without processing.

Product and Measures Management Aftersales (PuMA) 




Once a PuMA case is submitted, it is routed to one of the three departments that per¬ 
form the role of technical hotline. The three departments are : 

• Electrical 

• Chassis 

• Drivetrain 

These three departments are comprised of only eleven technical hotline specialists. 
Each month, they handle approximately 6,100 PuMA cases. 

A technical hotline specialist is responsible for reading the cases submitted by techni¬ 
cians and responding in an educated and timely fashion. 

Not all of the roughly 6,100 cases submitted have the same priority. The cases first read 
are those that “tagged”by the technicians as urgent. Others are read in the order they 
arrived in. 

It is imperative that the cases submitted are directed to the proper department, 
otherwise delays will definitely result. 

Example: A technician submits a case on an A/C concern and refers it to the 
Chassis department. It is case number 70 for the day (for that 
department). 

When the Chassis department gets that report, if it is not an urgent 
case, it has to wait until all cases received before it are answered. 

The technical hotline specialist might not get to the complaint in 
several hours until it is noticed that the case should have gone to 
the Electrical department. 

The case now has to get forwarded to the Electrical where it will 
have to wait in line in the order it arrived (might be case number 
200 for the day). 

A report is created on all cases that are related. These reports are analyzed by the engi¬ 
neering staff in the United States and then forwarded to their colleagues in Germany. 


5 

Product and Measures Management Aftersales (PuMA) 


Creating a PuMA Case 

After exhausting all available resources, please ensure that all cases contain the following 
information before submitting a case: 

• A full detailed description of the complaint and whether or not the complaint has 
been verified. 

• A detailed description of the operating conditions, environment, road conditions, 
anything related to the complaint or conditions under which it can be duplicated. 
The details must sufficient to insure that the person reading your case will be able 
to understand the situation and or duplicate it if necessary. 

• Identify any work previously performed during each service visit, for the same 
complaint. 

• Results of tests performed, i.e. fuel pressure, fuel mixture adaptations, resistance 
values. Always provide specific readings, statements such as “in spec” and “good” 
are not adequate. 

• When creating a case regarding Automatic Transmissions, please include “GM” or 
“ZF” in the subject line and the serial number of the installed transmission, in the 
“Work Performed” field of your case. Also include the transmission fluid level and 
condition. If the problem concerns shift characteristics, include the specific shift 
(i.e. 1 -2 or 5-4) that is causing the complaint. 

• Where fault codes are stored, include the name of the module concerned in “prob¬ 
lem description” and the actual fault codes in the “fault code” box.

OK thank you they are the details that were missing. Also the most recent FASTA data is from 6/3/05. 
Additional information 9/6/05 6:19 PM EST Technician Case 3 

I had checked the si related directly to the fault code, it says that there is no fix for the fault at this time, I 
followed the rest of the sib and checked the battery and the charging system, there was nothing 
abnormal about it. the only fault stored in the DME the one I have put in the case, so I then consulted 
with my shop foreman “Junior” and he asked me to writea Puma case to see if there was more that you 
have learned that was not included in SI 61-06-05 or anything else that I should check that would be 
related to the fault. Battery and charging test is as follows 11,99v 846cca, starter test 10.62v normal 
charging test load off 13.53v, load on 13.47v, diode ripple normal.
