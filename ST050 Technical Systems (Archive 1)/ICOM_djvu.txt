Introduction 


The Integrated Communication Optical Module (ICOM) is set of powerful vehicle inter¬ 
faces to be used with the Integrated Service Information Display (ISID) device. 

The ICOM consists of the following components: 

• ICOM A is the basic component. Physically, it provides the interfaces for connec¬ 
tion to the vehicle OBD II diagnostic interface on the one hand and the interfaces 
for adaptive integration into the workshop network on the other. A powerful com¬ 
puter core enables it to work as a protocol converter to assume the data inter¬ 
change between the tester and the vehicle control units as well as the signal pro¬ 
cessing for connection of the measurement system (IMIB). The power is supplied 
by KL 30 across the vehicle interface. 

• ICOM B is the external MOST (Media Oriented Systems Transport) interface for the 
ICOM A. It is connected to the ICOM A using the supplied USB cable or a com¬ 
mercially available USB cable of the type A-B. The power is supplied across the 
ICOM A by way of a USB cable connection. 

• ICOM C is an intelligent interface adapter that adapts the physical OBD II to the 
BMW circular socket. As an extended supplementary module, it connects ICOM A 
to vehicles without an OBD II female interface. The power supply is supplied at the 
vehicle by way of KL 30 from the BMW 20 pin circular socket.

ICOMA 


The ICOM A is the basic component. Physically, it provides the interfaces for connection 
to the vehicle OBD II female diagnostic interface connector. A powerful computer core 
enables it to work as a protocol converter to assume the data interchange between the 
tester and the vehicle control units as well as the signal processing for connection of the 
measurement system (IMIB). The power supply is supplied by way of KL 30 across the 
vehicle interface. The ICOM A is specified rated in electrical operation for a minimum 
voltage of 8 V. Stable operation is only ensured if the power supply is above the mini¬ 
mum voltage limit.

ICOM A can be connected to the workshop network by a Ethernet LAN cable 
or wireless connection by WLAN. The maximum data rate is 100 Mbit/s.

The IMIB can be connected by way of a Lemo connector to the ICOM A. 


The communication for the MOST Bus is supplied by ICOM B. For this purpose ICOM B 
is to be connected with the ICOM A by way of a supplied USB cable. 

The host communication is thru either a workshop network 
LAN connection or WLAN.

ICOM A Modular Structure 


Due to a limited number of connect cycles, contact elements to connect assemblies are 
subject to mechanical wear. The ICOM A concept enables replacement of wear parts, if 
required, with minimum overhead in order to preserve full functions of the overall device 
over a sustained period. 

Wear parts are the OBD II module (2) and the fan / connector module (3).

High Temperature in the ICOM A Working Environment 

High temperatures in the working environment of the ICOM A can have negative effects 
on the hardware during regular operation. A separate fan is provided for the ICOM A tool 
that is activated depending on the temperature increase inside the ICOM A. The fan 
ensures that the air is circulated, thus protecting the ICOM A against heat damage. 

The maximum permitted outside temperature is 45°C. If this limit value is exceed¬ 
ed, an irreparable malfunction in the hardware can occur, (thermo shutdown takes place) 
It must be ensured that the recirculation channel of the fan is not blocked by any objects 
during regular operation. The fan is activated, when the temperature inside the ICOM A 
exceeds a preset temperature value. The fan will remain on until the temperature drops 
below a preset limit value.

ICOMB 


The ICOM B is the external MOST (Media Oriented Systems Transport) interface of the 
ICOM A. It is connected to the ICOM A using the supplied USB cable or a commercially 
available USB cable of the type A-B. The power is supplied across the ICOM A by way 
of a USB cable connection. 

During electrical operation, the ICOM B is only operational when the ICOM A is being 
supplied with a minimum voltage of 8 V. If a cable other than that which is supplied is 
used for the data connection for the ICOM A. The cable must complies with the USB 
2.0 High Speed specification and is free of mechanical damage of any kind. 



Note: Initially ICOM B will not be used for diagnostics. It is therefore, 
not supported by Integrated Service Processes Application 2.x.

ICOM C 


The ICOM C is an intelligent interface adapter that adapts the physical 16 pin female 
OBD II socket to the BMW 20 pin circular socket. As an extended supplementary mod¬ 
ule, it connects ICOM A to BMW vehicles which do not have a 16 pin OBD II female 
interface, (older vehicles from the model E30 onwards). The power is supply from the 
vehicle by way of KL 30 (+) of pin 14 of the BMW 20 pin circular socket. 

The ICOM C is rated for electrical operation of a minimum voltage of 8 V. The voltage at 
KL30 is routed inside the ICOM C to the OBD II. This is how power provided to the 
ICOM A. Stable interaction of both devices (ICOM A & ICOM B) is only ensured when 
the vehicle’s battery voltage is maintain above the 8 V minimum limit. 

The BMW 20 pin round diagnostics connector contains a microprocessor that adapts 
the read data from the vehicle to the data format of ICOM A. (a protocol convertor)
