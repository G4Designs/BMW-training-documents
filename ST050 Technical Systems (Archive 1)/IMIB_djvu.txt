Integrated Measurement Interface Box 












Introduction 


The Integrated Measurement Interface Box gives access to the measuring technology in 
the new workshop system. The compact shape of the Integrated Measurement Interface 
Box makes it a versatile tool fortesting signal transmitters, data lines and electronic com¬ 
ponents of vehicles. 

The Integrated Measurement Interface Box offers the following functions: 

• Voltage measurement 

• Current measurement with current clips up to 1,800 A 

• Resistance measurement 

• Pressure measurement 

- Low-pressure measurement down to 2 bar onboard 

- Up to 100 bar with external sensor 

• Temperature measurement with external sensor 

• Use of 

- RZV cable (static ignition voltage distribution) 

- kV clip (kilovolt clip) 

-Trigger clip 

• Two-channel oscilloscope 

• Stimuli function

The measuring cables and sensors used with the Measurement Interface Box (MIB) 
to date, can for the most part, continue to be used. For oscilloscope measurements, 
standard measuring cables are used. These cables can also be used for voltage 
measurements. 

If a measurement is carried out during a diagnostic procedure, the result determined by 
the Integrated Measurement Interface Box is automatically evaluated in the diagnostics 
program and therefore influences the next diagnostics stage. In addition to its use in 
diagnostic procedures, the Integrated Measurement Interface Box can also double as 
a stand-alone and portable digital multimeter. 

The measured values are shown on the display screen. It is possible to measure voltage, 
current, pressure and resistance. Temperature and freguency, however, can only be 
measured as part of diagnostics, i.e. in the procedures of the Integrated Service 
Technical Application. Measured values are not displayed on the display screen if the 
Integrated Measurement Interface Box is being controlled by the Integrated Service 
Technical Application. 

The results are displayed in the Integrated Service Technical Application under 
"Measuring eguipment". Registration and configuration (e.g. of the display language) 
is carried out using the Workshop System Management. Software updates are similarly 
managed using the Workshop System Management and are implemented automatically 
when necessary. 

Other important features include: 

• Hard drive capacity: 20 GB 

• RAM: 512 MB 

• Rechargeable battery life: Up to 3 hours 

• Connection to workshop network by: 

- Cable 
-Wireless

The Integrated Measurement Interface Box also has a USB interface, which will be used 
for vehicle diagnostics in the future.

The workshop trolley used for Group Tester One, or GT1, can continue to be used for 
the new workshop system. It is simply a case of having to exchange the brackets for 
GT1 with the brackets for the Integrated Service Information Display. The brackets were 
delivered with the Integrated Service Information Display (ISID).
