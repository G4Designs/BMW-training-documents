Current probe 


When selecting the 50 A or 1000A current measurement function, the current 
probe will be the default test connection. The current probe is self calibrating. 


Pressure 

sensor 


Temperature 

sensor 


When selecting the pressure measurement function, the pressure sensor will 
be the default test connection. The reading will begin at approximately 1 Bar 
(the reading cannot be zeroed). 

When selecting the temperature measurement function, the temperature 
sensor will be the default test connection. The reading is only provided in 
degrees Celsius. 


Type of Measurement 

Various measurements reguire defining the type of signal measured. 



DC: Set to test a direct current signal. 



AC: Set to test for an alternating current signal. 


Effective value 


Displays a measured AC wave form as the RMS (root-mean-sguare) value. 
The RMS value is the DC equivalent of the voltage or current produced by an 
AC wave form. 


Measuring Range 

Sets scale range for selected measurement. 


automatic 


Scale will automatically range to the best suitable range. 


+/- 200mV 


Arrows are provided for the user to manually set range of measurement. 


Special Functions 


Hold screen 


Freezes the display with the current test results. Serves the same function as 
the buttons on the large MFK1 and 2 test leads. 


Minimum/ The current measured value is constantly monitored. The highest and lowest 

Maximum measured value since the activation of the function is displayed below the 

I actual display.

BMW Measurement System 






















System voltage and engine speed adds an additional field to the display 
that measures system voltage and engine RPM along with the original 
measurement. This feature requires that the TD cable and diagnostic 
head be connected. 

2nd 2nd measurement splits the main display field into two separate dis- 

measurement plays. This permits two measurements from separate test leads to be 
-1 displayed at the same time.

Stimulation Feature 


The counter function of the DISplus measurement system allows the user to measure 
time based signals. The measurements are: 

• Frequency 

• Period 

• Pulse duration 

• Pulse duty factor

The desired measurement is set-up from the screen by selecting from the following: 

• Measurement function 

• Test cable 

• Measurement range 

• Trigger level (default is set at 5 Volts) 

• Trigger slope (determines which portion of the signal will be used as the trigger point) 

Oscilloscope Function 

The oscilloscope function uses a digital dual trace display screen. There are two meth¬ 
ods for setting up the scope to display a pattern: manual setup or preset measurements. 

The oscilloscope setting screen is used to manually select how the measured signal will 
be displayed.

Once the settings are complete and the test connections are made the oscilloscope 
graph may be viewed by selecting the “Oscilloscope display” button. 

The oscilloscope signal pattern may be adjusted by manipulating the voltage level and 
the trigger level (voltage) from within the display screen. If the displayed pattern is still 
unreadable or incorrectly setup, the oscilloscope settings can be further adjusted by 
returning to the settings screen.

Oscilloscope Display Screen Features 

Once the signal pattern is displayed, the pattern may be locked on the screen with the 
“Hold screen” button or with the freeze image buttons on the test cable leads. 

Holding the image will activate the “Cursor”, “Zoom” and “Memory” features. Holding 
the image also allows the signal pattern to be visible when printing the screen. 


■ Cursor 1 and 2 

This feature is used to measure the amplitude and time differential of the signal pattern. 
Activate the feature by pressing the “Cursor 1 ” button first. A vertical line will appear. 
Roughly position the line by touching the desired measurement point on the screen. 


Anywhere the cursor line intersects the signal pattern, the amplitude value at that point 
will be displayed in a box on the right of the display screen. If both traces of the scope 
are being used, (both channel A and B) each value will be shown in its own box. A fine 
adjustment may be made to the cursor line by using the arrow buttons to the left and 
right of the cursor buttons. 


The time differential between two points may be measured if “Cursor 2” is used. Place 
the second cursor at the desired measurement point. The time difference value between 
the two cursors will be displayed in the “Time difference” box on the right side of the 


screen. 

With freeze image selected, 
press memory. Use the arrow 
keys to scroll back up to seven 
screenshots. 


Adjust to within voltage level of 
monitored signal to keep wave 
from “walking” on the screen. 


“Freezes” waveform on 
screen for measurement 
display in conjunction 
with cursor buttons or 
zoom function. 


With freeze 
image selected, 
use cursor but¬ 
tons to mark 
measuring 
points on the 
wave form. 
Use finger on 
the pattern to 
set approximate 
position and 
use the arrows 
to locate exact 
position.

■ Zoom 

By selecting the “Zoom” button, a section of the signal pattern may be enlarged to show 
greater detail. The desired section of the display is called up by touching the screen at 
the desired spot. 

Memory 

Memory pages are stored every time the Hold Screen is activated. The DISplus stores 
the last 10 trigger pulses at the time the screen is held. To recall the memory pages, 
press the “Memory” button and use the left arrow button to scroll through the previous 
9 pages (page 10 is already displayed). The cursor and zoom features may be used on 
the stored pages. 

Preset Measurements 


The preset measurements provide an easy method of testing several commonly mea¬ 
sured signals. To enter the presets: Press the “Preset measurements” button on the 
bottom of the screen. A pop up window will provide several signals to choose from. 
Selecting the signal and pressing the OK button will automatically configure the oscillo¬ 
scope to the settings needed to provide the best trace pattern. Many tests also have 
specialized boxes with additional readings( i.e RPM, system voltage). 

For instructions on which cables to use for the preset test, follow the instructions 
in the “Preset measurements” selection of the “Help” menu. 


Since the oscilloscope settings are pre-determined, no changes to the oscilloscope 
are possible.

Output Stimulator 

The stimulation function of the multimeter can be used to provide an output signal from 
the DISplus to test various components or vehicle wiring. MFK1 and the small leads of 
MFK 2 are used to conduct the output signal. After selecting the cable, press the 
Stimulate button in the right lower corner to activate. 

The following signal types may be simulated with this function: 

• DC Voltage from 0 to 15 Volts 

• AC Voltage from 1 Hz to 1 KHz and 0 to 15 Volts 

• Digital frequency from 1 Hz to 5KHZ and 0 to 100% duty cycle 

• Resistance from 0 to 10Kohm (MFK 1 only) 

• DC voltage using on/off switch
