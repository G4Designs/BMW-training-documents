System Components 


Monitor 

The DISplus uses a 15” TFT (Thin Film Transistor) monitor. It has a pressure sensitive 
touch screen controller to direct the curser movement. 


The monitor is attached to the DISplus by a 15’ cable that allows it to be used either on 
the swivel stand or remotely, e.g. inside of a vehicle. 



Main Power Switch 

The main power switch is located in the upper right hand side, at the rear of the DISplus. 

The main switch is turned on first, before turning the DISplus on from the front panel. 
The System Status LED on the front panel should illuminate amber when the main 
power has been turned on (see lower left illustration). 


Circuit breakers are located below the DISplus computer. If the unit fails to power-up, 
check the reset of the circuit breakers before calling for service.

System Indicators and ON/OFF Button 


After the main power switch has been turned 
on, the DISplus is powered up by pressing the 
on/off button on the front panel. 

During power up, LED 2 will illuminate. When 
the process is complete, the System Status 
LED changes from amber to green. 

The fault indicator, LED 3, illuminates amber 
when there is a fault with the DISplus.

DVD and 3.5” Floppy Drive 

The DVD and Floppy drives are located 
behind a door on the right side of the unit. 

The Floppy drive is used for the boot-up disk 
when loading the Diagnosis Program. 

The DVD drive is used to load the Basis and 
Program CDs for Diagnosis. 

The TIS CD is also loaded in the DVD drive 
and remains in the drive for the computer to 
access during TIS operation. 



RF Access Point 

The access point is the transfer device 
between the hardwired LAN network and the 
radio frequency assisted LAN. 

The DISplus is connected to the access point 
via a network LAN cable. The access point 
then communicates with the Diagnostic Head 
using a radio frequency LAN link.

DISplus 





















Diagnostic Head 

The DISplus uses a Diagnostic 
Head similar to the DISplus III as 
the communication link between 
the DISplus and the vehicle elec¬ 
tronics. 

The Head receives operating 
power when the diagnosis cable 
is connected to the vehicle. 



Communication between the DISplus and the Head can occur two ways: 

• Radio frequency (maximum 30m distance) 

• Hard wired to the network or DISplus

■ Diagnostic Cable 

20 and 16 pin cables are provided for connection between the vehicle diagnostic socket 
and Diagnostic Head. 



16 pin OBD II connector 


20 pin connector (not used for MINI) 


■ Test Cables 

Various test cables and the main power cable 
are connected to the rear of the DISplus 
through the conduit channel of the cable 
arm mast. The following test cables are 
stored on the arm. 


LAN (Local Area Network) Connection 

The LAN connection has the appearance of a 
large phone receptacle. It provides the 
connection for the DISplus to the Ethernet 
wiring for the Service Department Network. 



■ TD (RPM input) Cable 

TD is a processed engine RPM signal. The TD 
input cable is used for specific test modules or 
preset measurements that require a hard wired 
RPM input for measurement functions.

Multi-Function Test Cable-MFK#1 
(two cable ends) 

MFK 1 is used to measure: 

• Voltage - up to 50 Volts 

• Current - up to 2 Amps 

• Resistance 

• Diode Testing 

• Frequency 

• Period 

• Duty Cycle 

• Pulse Duration 

• Oscilloscope Measurements 

Multi-Function Test Cable-MFK#2 
(Four cable ends) 

MFK 2 is used to measure: 

• Voltage - up to 500 Volts 

• Frequency 

• Period 

• Duty Cycle 

• Pulse Duration 

• Oscilloscope Measurements 




Both MFK 1 and MFK 2 can be used for signal outputs from the stimulate output func¬ 
tion of the multimeter. 

On MFK 2, the two large cable ends are for input only (measuring) and the two small 
ends are for the Stimulate Output function. MFK 1 ’s leads are for both measuring and 
stimulation. 


Both large positive cable ends of MFK 1 and 
MFK 2 include a button used to hold the mea¬ 
sured value on the display screen.

Trigger Clip (inductive) 

The trigger clip is used when testing ignition 
or fuel injection systems to establish engine 
firing order. 



Additional Test Cables 

There are additional test cables connected to the rear of the DISplus on the measure¬ 
ment system board. The ends of the cables are color-coded for easy identification.

Secondary Ignition Test Cables 

The inductive clip (1) is used when checking secondary ignition on vehicles. It is clipped 
to the vehicle’s spark plug wire. 



■ 50 and 1000 Amp Inductive Probes 

The Amp probes measure AC and DC current. They are self calibrating inductive pickups. 




■ Temperature Sensor 

The long temperature probe measures the temperature of liquids and gasses. The mea¬ 
surement range is from -20°C to 200°C.

DISplus 







■ Pressure Sensor 

The Pressure Sensor measures from 0 to 25 bar. There are two pressure inputs to the 
measuring unit that permit two different pressures to be measured simultaneously if two 
sensors are used.
