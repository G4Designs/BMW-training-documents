INTRODUCTION 


The E46 Convertible is the replacement for the E36 Convertible and is based on the E46 
Coupe. It is initially being introduced in March 2000, as a 323 Model only with the M52 TU 
2.5 liter engine. The 3 liter version of the E46iC will begin production starting in 6/2000. 

The E46 323 features a new design top that consists of a three layer top and all glass rear 
window. The 323 comes with a manual top as standard eguipment. The new fully automatic 
electro-hydraulic top is available as an option. The 330 E46iC will come with the fully auto¬ 
matic top as standard eguipment. 

The roll over protection system is standard eguipment and is similar in design to the E36 
system. The roll over protection bars are hidden by the rear headrest and deployed under 
the same criteria as the E36 system. 

The front seats of the E46iC are a new design with the seat integrated belt (SGS) system 
similar to the system introduced on the E31 - 8 series vehicles.

E46iC BODY/ST039/4/13/00 




Purpose of the System: 


The body shell of the E46iC has been developed specifically for the convertible to improve 
crash performance which is similar to the E46 Coupe. This was achieved by the use of 
reinforcements on the body shell that improved torsional rigidity (body twisting). In the main 
body floor pan, reinforcements were necessary to accommodate the new 5G5 (Seat 
Integrated Belt System) seat system. In the rear floor pan, reinforcements were necessary 
to account for the variable convertible top storage, compartment floor. 



IART-E46B0DY3 


Components of the System 

Floor Pan 

The floor pan is reinforced to support the SGS seat by heavier cross brace members, rein¬ 
forced tunnel/floor pan and reinforced engine support brackets. During a collision all forces 
occurring on the seat are channeled to be absorbed by the floor pan. 


Windshield Frame 

The windshield frame is reinforced with stepped 
reinforcing tubes to allow it to act as a roll-over pro¬ 
tection. During the rollover all of the forces exerted 
on the A-pillar of the windshield frame are transmit¬ 
ted as a Moment (Torque) to the bottom of the A- 
pillarwhere stepped reinforced tubes are reinforced. 



IART-E46B0DY4

E46iC B 0 DY/ST039/4/13/00 



Rear Bulkheads 

The rear bulkheads are redesigned to support the roll¬ 
over protection and seat belts. They are welded to 
increase structural rigidity and to secure rear seat, rear 
seat belts and the mounting point for the ISO child seat. 



ART-E46B0DY5 


Variable Top Storage Compartment 

The variable top storage compartment is reinforced to make the top storage compartment 
rigid and stronger, not to allow twisting moments when the soft top is in its compartment 
or when the compartment is opened to enlarge the storage area. 


Tension Strut 

Tension struts are integrated into the rear of the 
body shell to improve the torsional rigidity by not 
allowing body twist in the rear. It also keeps the 
rear end of the car intact with the middle floor 
pan. 


Aluminum Support Plate 

An aluminum support plate is incorporated into 
the front suspension carrier to achieve a high 
degree of rigidity combined with low weight. 


All of these design improvements increased the 
E46iC torsional rigidity by 50% compared to the 
E 3 6 iC: 

E36 Convertible Torsional Rigidity 600ON m/degree 
E46 Convertible Torsional Rigidity 9000 Nm/degree

INSTRUMENT CLUSTER 


Purpose of the System: 

The instrument cluster displays the information about the status of different operating sys¬ 
tems in the vehicle. The information is received in the form of dial gauges, LCD display, 
warning LEDs and Gong sound. Switches are also integrated in the instrument cluster to 
reset the trip mileage, perform BC functions and to change over some units of measure¬ 
ment e.g. degree F to degree C. 



IART-E46B0DY8.EPS 


Components of the System: 

The instrument cluster layout in the E46iC is the same configuration as the E46 Coupe and 
Sedan. The cluster continues to use five analog gauges to display engine RPM, engine 
temperature, fuel level and economy display. 

There are three LCD blocks to display: 

Check control pictogram 

Service Interval, mileage and outside temperature 
Transmission range program and failure display 

Warning indicators and lamps are arranged to the right and left of the LCD blocks. The 
ASC, charge indicator, high beam and oil pressure lamps are located between the 
speedometer and tachometer.

FRONT SEATS 


Purpose of the System: 

The front seats of the E46iC are designed in such a way that all forces acting on the occu¬ 
pants during collision are reduced to the floor pan by the defined design characteristics of 
the seat. The front seat also incorporate the Seat Integrated belt System (SGS) and the 
"Comfort Entry Aid System". 

Components of the System: 



MOTOR ,_ 

lART-EBODYll 


Seat Integrated Belt System (SGS) 


The SGS seat is similar in design to the SGS in the E31. The backrest and seat frame are 
reinforced to allow the belt system and deflection points to be integrated into the seat. All 
of the belt fastening points move with the seat as it is adjusted. This ensures the best pos¬ 
sible body strapping irrespective of the seat position or body size. With the short free belt 
lengths, the occupants are held quicker with any vehicle deceleration. The SGS design will 
cause all forces occurring during a collision to be channeled into the reinforced floor pan. 


15 

E46iC BODY/ST039/4/13/00 



Seat Belt Assembly 


The fixed anchor point and seat belt tensioner are mounted on the seat frame. The upper 
deflection point of the belt is attached to the head rest which causes the belt to be opti¬ 
mally positioned when the head rest is moved. 

The inertia reel locking mechanism is attached to the backrest frame of the seat. It con¬ 
sists of two independent triggering devices which act on the inertia reel. 

The first triggering device locks the belt during fast cornering, heavy braking, 
roll over or during impact. 

The second triggering device serves as an auxiliary safety lock and is controlled 
by the "M ass M oment of Inertia". The position of the mass moment of inertia is a 
decisive factor for the belt to lock. 

The inertia reel locking mechanism is connected through a lever and a cable drive to a gear 
assembly on the seat back hinge. As the angle of the backrest is adjusted, the gearassem- 
bly and cable drive will change the angle of the inertia lock. This ensures that the lock is in

Comfort Entry Aid 

The switch for the comfort entry aid feature is positioned at the top of the seat back. The 
switch provides an input to the seat module which activates the seat forward/backward 
motor. 

When pressed forward, the motor rapidly moves the 
seat to its most forward position. 

When the switch is pressed rearward, the seat returns 
to the previous set position. 


When the lever for the backrest is raised and the back 
rest is pulled forward, the back rest lock switch pro¬ 
vides an input to the seat module. The module acti¬ 
vates the head rest motor and it moves down to its 
lowest position. When the seat back rest is relocked, 
the module activates the head rest motor to return to 
its previous set position. This feature will only activate 
when the seat is moved forward far enough to cause 
the head rest to interfere with the sun visoras the back 
rest is pulled forward. The seat module recognizes the 
position of the seat base for activation of this feature.

SEAT MEMORY SYSTEM 
Purpose of the System: 

The seat memory system uses two control modules on each front seat (driver and pas¬ 
senger). One processor is incorporated into the seat adjusting switch and a second 
processor is mounted under the seat. The functions of the two control modules is to 
process the following inputs and outputs to control the seat: 

Seat adjustments 
Comfort entry aid switch 
Seat back rest lock micro switch 
Seat belt fastened 

K-bus communication with the GM V and Instrument Cluster 

As with previous systems, the Driver seat memory feature stores three seat positions for 
recall. The positions are stored in the non-volatile memory preventing loss of positions in 
case the SM orthe battery is disconnected. 

Components of the System: 

Refer to the Driver's and Passenger's memory seat IPO. 

System Operation: 

The seat adjusting switch block communicates with the control module over dedicated 
lines. The output stages forseat motor movement are in the control module. The seat posi¬ 
tions are recognized through the use of hall sensors on the motors. All components of the 
seat memory system are monitored for faults. 

Additional functions of the memory system include memorizing the position of the seat and 
headrest when the entry aid feature is activated. The seat will return to its previous set posi¬ 
tion when the entry aid switch is pressed rearward or the seat back rest is locked.

MIRROR MEMORY SYSTEM 


Purpose of the System: 

The function of the mirror memory system is to: 

Memorize mirror positions, 

Adjust mirrors, 

Control heaters for the outside mirrors and windshield spray nozzle 
Communicate with the Driver's seat memory module to recall mirror positions 

Components of the System 

The mirror memory system consists of the following components: 


M irror adjusting switch 
Driver's mirror memory module 
Passenger's mirror memory module 
Driver's seat memory module 
Mirrors with adjusting motors and 
feedback potentiometer 


The mirrors are hinged mechanically to swing up instead of in as on previous mirror sys¬ 
tems. 




23 

E46iC BODY/ST039/4/13/00 





System Operation: 

Each mirror module is responsible for mirror adjustment, storage of the mirror positions and 
mirror heating. Operation of the mirror adjusting switch remains the same for initial setting 
of the mirror positions. Feedback potentiometers are used for mirror position recognition for 
memory storage purposes. The driver's mirror module communicates with the passenger's 
mirror module and the seat module over the K-bus. 

When a memory position is set with the seat module, a signal is sent to the mirror modules 
over the K-bus and the current positions are stored in memory locations 1, 2 or 3 in the 
respective modules. 

When a memory button is pressed for recall of a stored position, the seat module signals 
the mirror modules over the K-bus to return the mirrors to the stored settings.

REAR SEATS 


The E46iC is designed as a four passenger vehicle. Only two seat belts are installed in the 
rear that correspond to the seat belt system of the E36iC. 



The E46iC is equipped with child seat mounting brackets on the left and right sides below 
the seat base. The brackets conform to ISO (International Organization of Standardization) 
for placement on the rear floor pan. Any ISO child seat can be installed by simply sliding 
the seat into position between the seat base and backrest and locking it into place.

VARIABLE CONVERTIBLE TOP STORAGE COMPARTMENT FLOOR 


Purpose of the System: 


The trunk of the E46 convertible offers a new feature called the "Variable Convertible Top 
Storage Compartment Floor". This feature allows the luggage storage area to be enlarged 
by approximately 40 liters when the soft top is raised or removed for hard top installation. 



Components of the system: 


Variable Compartment Floor 

The variable compartment floor is constructed of plastic with fabric covering. It is hinged 
mechanically so that it can be rotated up into the top storage area providing additional lug¬ 
gage storage space in the trunk. The floor is hinged at four points to allow it to articulate 
and fold upwards: 



26 

E46iC B O DY/ST039/4/13/00 








Actuating Lever 

An actuating lever is integrated in the variable 
compartment floor on the right side. It allows 
the compartmentfloorto be opened and closed 
using the actuating lever. It also locks the com¬ 
partment floor into position. 


Dampening Piston 


A dampening piston is also integrated in the 
variable compartment floor on the right side. It 
assists in the movement of the variable com¬ 
partment floor to either position and keep it 
fixed in that set position (retracted or extended). 
The lower dampening piston hinge switches 
the micro switch integrated on the right side of 
the compartment floor when the variable com¬ 
partment floor is in the raised position. This sig¬ 
nal is provided to the CVM to lock out the oper¬ 
ation of the convertible-top. 



System Operation: 

Opening the variable compartment floor 

The convertible top must be raised or removed from the storage compartment. 

Pull the actuating lever rear wards and push it down and toward the rear bulkhead 

Closing the variable compartment floor 

Pull the actuating lever down. 

Pull the compartment floor rear wards to close the floor.
