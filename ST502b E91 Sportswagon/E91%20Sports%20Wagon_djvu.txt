E91 Sports Wagon 





Introduction 


The new 3 Series Sports Wagon satisfies the standards of style, flexibility and perfor¬ 
mance - far in excess of sheer driving pleasure. It combines first class driving dynamics 
with versatile functionality. 

It will be introduced in the US as a 325xiT in September 2005. Variants will be available 
in March 2006. 

The technical basis of the E91 is the E90, the 3 Series Sedan, with which the Sports 
wagon is virtually identical up to the B-pillar. Therefore, what has already been said about 
the 3 Series Sedan also applies to the Sports Wagon: It is - when compared with the 
previous model (E46) - stronger and bigger, and the E91 has above all become more 
functional. 

Like the Sedan, the E91 has sporty proportions thanks to its long engine bonnet and a 
striking swage line rising along the entire side of the caras an expression of powerful 
dynamics. 

The roof line of the Sports Wagon is like a Coupe and the roof spoiler is integrated in 
these lines. Roof rails are standard. 



4 

E91 Sports Wagon 
































Technical highlights of the new 3 Series Sports Wagon are its two-part rear hatch and a 
large panorama sunroof available as an option. 


The rear hatch is set at a much lower level in the interests of a low loading sill. The rear 
tailgate continues to be composed of two segments (the rear window can be opened 
separately). 



Atfirst glance, the panorama sunroof of the E91 is identical to similar roofs from X-vehi- 
cles and the 5 Series Sports Wagon. However, it does differfrom it in some details. 



This Manual describes the E91 with regard to all points on which it differs from the E90. 
Points on which the Sports Wagon is identical to the sedan are not repeated here.

Body 


Like the Sedan, the body of the new BMW 3 Series Sports Wagon is conventionally 
manufactured from steel. It is fully galvanized and equipped with a safety passenger cell. 
All the performance data of the E90 with regard to weight optimization, body stiffness 
and supreme safety levels apply without any compromises to the E91 as well. 

The bodies of the Sedan and Sports Wagon were developed in parallel. This has made it 
possible from the start not only to identify the identical components required but also to 
take into account parts and components specific to the Sports Wagon. 

The specific stiffness configuration of the E91 is based on very high target values, where 
the lightweight side-frame concept already takes into account the special demands 
made by the large roof opening for the panorama sunroof. 

Unlike in previous 3 Series Sports Wagons, the floor assembly does not require any 
Sports Wagon-specific reinforcements because the lightweight concept of the E91 has 
already been geared towards the increased demands placed on the Sports Wagon. 
Because of this, the new 3 Series Sports Wagon copes perfectly well without additional 
reinforcements which would increase the car's weight and limit interior space and load 
space. 

The body of the new 3 Series Sports Wagon also fulfills all the requirements from a 
functional standpoint. When compared with its predecessors, it is characterized by a 
even larger luggage-compartment volume of 16.24 cu. ft. (460 liters) and 49 cu. ft. 

(1385 liters) with the backrests folded down. The indentation in the rear bumper 
reduces the height of the loading sill and makes loading easier. 

The static stiffness is approx. 19000 Nm/degree, while the dynamic stiffness is 
approximately 29 Hz.

E91 Sports Wagon 




Panorama Sunroof 

All E91 Sports Wagons sold in the US will be equipped with a panorama sunroof.The 
E91 panorama sunroof is an internally operating slide/tilt sunroof with two glass lids and 
two floating roofliners. 


The glass surface area of the E91 sunroof has increased by 140% when compared with 
the sunroof on the E46 Sports Wagon. This improves the sense of space felt by both the 
front and the rear passengers. 



Panorama Sunroof (E91) Single Panel Sunroof (E46/3) 


The E91 panorama sunroof is based on that of the E83 with a slight yet significant 
change. The 50 mm wide ventilation gap on the floating roofliners is at the front and not 
in the middle as on the E83. 

The wind deflector is operated by a mechanism controlled via the floating roofliner motor. 
This wind deflector is controlled as a function of vehicle speed. 

In this way, both lower-frequency drumming (at approx. 70 km/h) and higher-frequency 
whistling (above 120 km/h) are suppressed. 

This is achieved by the net wind deflector, which adopts different heights and therefore 
counteracts the interference noise.

Individual Components of Panorama Sunroof 


11 

E91 Sports Wagon 






Glass Panels / Roofliners 

Both glass lids can be removed from the E91 panorama sunroof.The retaining screws 
must also be released if the lids are adjusted. 

The two floating roofliners can then also be removed. When the panorama sunroof casing 
is installed, the two electric motors and the wind deflector can still be installed and 
removed. 

Motors 

The panorama sunroof uses two motors for operation. One motor is used solely for the 
operation of the glass panels and the other controls the roofliners and wind deflector. 

The motors are identical and thus can be interchanged for diagnostic purposes but 
should always be left in their original position. This is due to the wear pattern on the 
motor drive to the bowden/screw cable that drives the sunroof components. 

Each motor contains two Hall sensors offset by 90 degrees with respect to each other. 

Tis enables the MDS control unit to accurately detect rotation, speed of rotation, and 
direction of rotation. This signal is also used to detecta possible trapping condition.

Multi Drive Sunroof (MDS) Control Unit 

A separate control unit is installed forthe panorama glass sunroof functions. The panora¬ 
ma glass sunroof control unit (multi drive sunroof M DS) controls and monitors the electric 
motors and thus the movement of the panorama glass sunroof. 

The MDS is installed in the headliner behind the panorama glass sunroof. It can be 
accessed from the rear of the vehicle. 

Roof Function C enter (FZD) control unit 

The FZD is used to receive the sunroof switch status and convert it to a signal that can 
be transmitted to the M DS control unit over the K-CAN.The roof function center control 
unit also houses the sunroof switch.

Principles of Operation 

The panorama sunroof operation has been almost entirely adapted from the E61 Sports 
Wagon and X3/X5. 

The only difference in operation is that when the sunroof glass panels are placed in the 
vent mode, the floating headliner does not vent from the middle. Instead the sunroof 
headliner slides back from the front section similar to conventional single panel sunroofs.

Rear Seats 


The rear of the E91 Sports Wagon is equipped with 60/40 fold down rear seats. This 
allows for increased cargo capacity as well as a varied storage configurations. 

The belt-buckle tensioning system, ISOFIX (child seat holder), and center armrest are 
fitted as standard equipment. A removable skibag module is optionally available. 


A new feature are the manually folding head restraints. This allows a clearer view of the 
rear when the rear seats are not occupied.

■ Storage Pan 

A storage pan is located under the turning 
floor. The material is composed of easily 
washable fleece. This storage area with its 
removable, variable segmentation serves to 
store small parts which are not in the immedi¬ 
ate field of vision. 



■ Turning Floor 

The back of the turning floor is coated with 
an anti-skid nobbled finish and can be wiped 
clean. It serves to transport dirty objects. The 
surface can be quickly replaced by turning 
the floor over. 



Trim Panels 

The customer can tidily store assorted small items such as gloves, ice scrapers, bottles, 
cloths, etc. The parts are securely stored and the luggage compartment remains unclut¬ 
tered and tidy. 

The luggage compartment storage pack offers: 

• Left and right side lashing straps on the luggage compartment trim panels 

• Left and right swing-out bag holders 

• 12-volt power socket (left side trim panel) 

• Umbrella holder under the roller blind cover 

• Rear right side stowage net (slides down to accommodate long items ex. golf clubs)

The roller blind incorporates the following features: 

• Roller blind cover with comfort opening 

• Dividing net function for loads backrests up and down 

• Umbrella holder 

RollerBlind Cover with Comfort Opening 

The cargo cover on the E91 utilizes the same concept as the E61 Sports Wagon. It has 
the automatically retracting feature when opening either the tailgate or the glass window 
of the tailgate. To activate the retractable cover, press the outer rear hatch button a 
second time within 3 seconds when opening or press the window release button once.

The junction box control unit then activates the release drives of the combination roller 
blind for approx. 2 secs. The rotary motion of the release drives releases the combination 
roller blind via Bowden cables. 

When the fixture for the roller blind cover is automatically released, the retaining rod 
slides with the roller blind cover upwards in the left and right guide rails to provide 
access to the boot space. This allows the customer to load through the rear window 
opening without having to additionally open the entire tailgate. The cover does not 
lower itself automatically. It has to be lowered manually. 

Dividing Net Function for Loads 

The combination roller blind offers a load securing function when the backrests are 
folded down as well as in their upright position. 

The customer can secure the load to prevent damage in the event of a sudden decelera¬ 
tion by pulling out a dividing net and engaging the rods in the designated eyelets.

Rear Hatch 


The rear hatch is designed so that the rear window can be opened separately. It is thus 
possible, for example when loading and unloading lighter objects, to reach the luggage 
compartment without having to open the complete rear hatch. This facilitates swift 
loading and unloading operations. 



Tailgate and Window Open Window Open 


Unlocking the Rear Hatch/Window 

The tailgate can be open by: 

• Remote control/identification transmitter 

• Rear hatch button inside the vehicle on the A-pillar 

• Rear window button in the rear hatch 

• Pulling the emergency release cable on the rear tailgate 

Opening the Rear Hatch 

The boot lid can be unlocked via the remote control, the identification transmitter, the 
outer or inner boot lid release button. 

0pening with Remote Control / Identification Transmitter 

When the release button with the rear hatch symbol remote control/identification trans¬ 
mitter is pressed, the signal reaches first the rear window antenna and then the remote 
control receiver. 

The remote control receiver is located in the diversity module and forwards the signal to 
the car access system 2. The signal of the identification transmitter is verified in the car 
access system 2. If the signal is recognized as valid, the junction box control unit is 
enabled forthe purpose of unlocking the central locking drive units. 

The junction box control unit now activates the central locking drive unit forthe rear 
hatch. The rear hatch opens irrespective of whether the vehicle is locked or not. 

The motor in the lock of the rear hatch is activated via a power output stage in the junc¬ 
tion box control unit. The rear hatch is opened.

J unction Box Control Unit 

The central locking for the rear hatch and the rear window is activated directly via a power 
output stage. The junction box control unit monitors the status of both the outer rear 
hatch button and the rear window button. 

When one of the buttons is pressed, the junction box control unit activates the central 
locking drive unit. 

The car access system 2 monitors the status of the inner rear hatch button. The status is 
communicated to the junction box control unit via the K-CAN. When requested to unlock 
the rear hatch, the junction box control unit activates the central locking drive unit. 

Note: To release the roller blind when opening the reartailgate assembly press 
the tailgate release button a second time within 3 seconds.

Engines 

Initially the E91 Sports Wagon will only be offered as a 325xiT with later configurations 
to follow. 

The new BMW N52-generation inline six cylinder engines deliver incomparable agility 
with more power but less weight and lowerfuel consumption. VALVETRONIC and dou¬ 
ble VANOS are additional features of this engine which, in the E91 as already in the E90, 
is combined exclusively with 6-speed gearboxes. 

xDrive All-Wheel-Drive System 

Initially the E91 Sports Wagon will only be offered in an all wheel drive version. Atthe 
same time, the all-wheel-drive system will also be making its debut in the new 3 Series 
Sedan (September 2005). 

The system and function are already familiar from the X3, X5 and 5 Series. Some com¬ 
ponents such as e.g. the propeller shafts have been geometrically adapted to the altered 
space conditions in the 3 Series.

Advanced Power Management - Load/Consumer Reduction 

If a critically low vehicle voltage is reached, it is possible, in addition to increasing idle 
speed and raising the charging voltage setpoint value specification, for different electrical 
loads/consumers to be reduced in terms of their power output or deactivated completely. 
This allows a reduced power consumption in critical situations. 

Load/consumer deactivation takes place under two conditions only: 

• Battery charge state in critical range 

• Full alternator utilization

E91 Body Electronics 


The E91 is based to a large extent on the electrics/electronics of the E90. It is therefore 
assumed in the description of the E91 that you have a sound basic knowledge of the 
E90. 

However, there are changes when compared with the E90. 

An obvious change is the split rear hatch. With its split rear hatch, the E91 has closing 
and opening options which are differentfrom those ofthe E90. 

This means that changes are required in the vehicle electrical system and in the central 
locking. 

The M RS 5 multiple restraint system and Personal Profile have been taken overfrom the 
E90. 

Bus System 

The bus system on the E91 has changed to make way for the addition ofthe MDS 
control unit.

Central Locking System 

The central locking system has been taken overfrom the E90.The car access system 2 
continues to assume the master function for central locking. The junction box control unit 
activates the central locking. The footwell module makes available the status of the door 
contacts. 

However, the E91 central locking has been adapted to the vehicle.This means that com¬ 
ponents are added forthe split rear hatch and the combination roller blind. 

The components in detail are: 

• Central locking, rear window 

• Rear window button 

• Central locking, rear hatch 

• Rear hatch button in the rear hatch 

• Left and right release motors for combination roller blind 

The central locking functions of the split rear hatch and the release feature of the combi¬ 
nation roller blind are described in the further course of this publication.

■ Output FB DO N 

Comfort access uses the output FBD_ON to enable communication to take place 
between the identification transmitter and the vehicle. 

Comfort access activates the output FBD_ON when it identifies a request (when the 
sensitive outer surface of the outer door handle is touched) for unlocking or locking. 

This output is directly connected to the remote control receiver and supplies it with vehi¬ 
cle voltage. 

Shortly afterwards, the identification transmitter is prompted by comfort access to 
authenticate itself. To authenticate itself, the identification transmitter only transmits a 
telegram within a very narrow, precisely tuned period of time. 

After the end of the telegram, the remote control receiver only remains briefly activated 
in order to receive new telegrams. The remote control receiver is deactivated if no new 
telegrams are received. 

Note: In the interest of reducing power consumption, the remote control 
receiver is deactivated/activated at cyclical intervals. 

In the event of a prompt with the remote control, 10 telegrams are 
transmitted for authentication. The transmission is configured so that 
there are at least three telegrams in the cyclical ON time of the remote 
control receiver. Reception of the three telegrams is sufficient forthe 
remote control to be able to authenticate itself.

Wipers 

The front wipe/wash system has been taken overfrom the E90.The rear wipe/wash sys¬ 
tem is derived from the E87 and has been adapted to the E91. 

Each of the wiper motors is equipped with a reset contact. 

Wiper Switch 

The wipe/wash system is switched on and off with the wiper switch. The wiper switch is 
an integral part of the steering column switch cluster SZL. 

The function of the wipe/wash system has been taken overfrom the E90. Therefore only 
rear wiping is explained in the following. 

The following functions are switched on with the wiper switch: 

• Wipe rear window 

• Wash rear window 



The signals of the wiper switch are sent from the steering column switch cluster via the 
FCAN to Dynamic Stability Control. 

The signal is then transferred from Dynamic Stability Control via the PT-CAN to the junc¬ 
tion box control unit. The junction box control unit evaluates the signals and activates the 
wiper motor for example.

Functional Description 
Wiping the Rear Window 

The rear window wipe function is switched on with the wiper switch by pressing the stalk 
forward. 

Intermittent Wipe 

The intermittent wipe function of the rear window wiper is started by pressing the wiper 
switch forward. 

The optical signal from the steering column switch is evaluated by the steering column 
switch cluster which sends the signal on the F-CAN to the DSC control unit. From 
Dynamic Stability Control, the signal is made available on the PT-CAN. 

The junction box receives the signal and correspondingly activates the rear window wiper. 
The junction box control unit detects the rest position (park position) of the wiper by 
means of the reset contact in the rear window wiper. 

Continuous Wipe 

During intermittent wipe the rear window wiper switches over to continuous wipe when 
reverse gear is engaged. 

For safety reasons, operation of the rear window wiper is terminated when the rear hatch 
or rear window is opened. The wiper must then be switched on again. 

Rear Antiblocking Function 

The antiblocking function is integrated in the junction box control unit. 

If the signal is not sent from the reset contact while the wiper motor is running, this is 
interpreted as a blocking situation. The junction box control unit evaluates the signal from 
the reset contact for the antiblocking function. 

The junction box control unit switches off the blocking motor. A further attempt can be 
made to switch on the wiper. If the wiper blocks again, it will no longer be operative for 
approx. 3 minutes. 

The wiper inhibit is cancelled by changing from terminal R ON to terminal R OFF and ter¬ 
minal R ON. The wiper must then be switched on again. 

Rear Window Wash Function 

The rear window wash function is started by overpressing the wiper switch forward. 

Initially, the washerfluid pump for the rear window is activated, followed by the rear win¬ 
dow wiper switching on. 

The wipe function set before the start of the wash cycle and after the end of the wash 
function is continued again.

Playback of MP3 and WMA Files 

The RAD 2 has supported the playback of MP3 and WM A files from the time the E90 
was introduced. 

Now, the CCC playback capabilities have improved.The CD drive and the DVD drive can 
not only play back normal audio-C Ds but also play C Ds with compressed audio data in 
the formats MP3and WMA. 

Information such as folder name, music track or artist are shown in the display. Detailed 
information based on ID3 tags can also be displayed. ID3 tags are pieces of additional 
information which are added to the music data. 

A track display for an M P3 CD is shown in the following.

E91 Sports Wagon 












Electro-Dynamic Planar Speaker 

Two speakers are installed in the rooflinerto deliver perfect Surround Sound under all 
load conditions in the luggage compartment. 

Because of the narrow installation depth, the new concept of the electro-dynamic planar 
speaker has been used. 

An acoustic lens is used in order to adapt the radiating characteristic of the speaker to the 
vehicle-specific factors. This results in a uniform distribution of the sound pressure in the 
rear passenger area. 


Design of the Electro-Dynamic Planar Speaker 

The electro-dynamic planar speaker is designed in such a way that all the moving com¬ 
ponents are situated on a single "film diaphragm". This brings about an installation depth 
of just 6 mm. 

In orderforthe speakerto be able to generate the necessary sound pressure compared 
with a conventional speaker, the diaphragm surface must be larger than that of conven¬ 
tional speakers. 

The following graphic shows the basic design of the electro-dynamic planar speaker.

Neodym Magnet Rods 

The advantages of neodym magnet rods over conventional magnet rods are: 

• Better efficiency 

• Lower weight 

• Low magnet stray field 

Acoustic Lens 

The function of the acoustic lens is to distribute the sound pressure of the electrodynam¬ 
ic planar speaker uniformly in the vehicle. 

The following graphic shows what effects the acoustic lens has on sound distribution. 

The radiating characteristic of the speaker is influenced by its structural design and the 
acoustic lens. Damage to the acoustic lens has a negative effect on sound properties.

Principle of Operation of the Electro-Dynamic Speaker 

The functions of the moving components (shown in green) of the conventional speaker 
are combined in a single component in the electro-dynamic planar speaker. This compo¬ 
nent is the film diaphragm (shown in green) with the coil arrangement on top. 

The function of the speaker magnet (shown in black) is replaced by magnet rods (also 
shown in black). The magnet rods are arranged as a separate unit in the immediate vicini¬ 
ty of the film diaphragm. The frame supports the film diaphragm and the magnet rods. 


When the coil on the film diaphragm is excited by the signal oftheTop HiFi amplifier, a 
magnetic field is generated which moves back and forth in relation to the magnet rods. A 
different sound level is generated depending on the intensity of the movement.

Aerials / Antennas 

The E91 has several antenna systems, depending on the optional extras: 

• FM/AM radio (rear window and rear spoiler) 

• Digital radio (roof-mounted antenna) 

• Navigation (roof-mounted antenna) 

• Telephone (roof-mounted antenna) 

• Bluetooth antenna in steering column casing for mobile phone connection 

• Emergency antenna on rear left wheel arch (only in conjunction with BMW ASSIST) 

• Remote control services 

A HM BL filter is fitted in order to suppress disturbing pulses during radio reception 
caused by the high-mounted brake light (HMBL).The blocking circuits for the rear win¬ 
dow supply lead (+/-) are integrated in the HM BL filter.
