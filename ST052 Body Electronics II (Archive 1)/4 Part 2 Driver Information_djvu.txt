Lamp Module (LM) (E38 start of production up to 9/95) 


The Lamp Module (LM) is designed to oontrol and monitor all the outside lights on the 
vehiole. Various displays and switohes are also illuminated by an LM funotion. 

The LM inoorporates power transistor output stages with internal proteotion oirouits. This 
eliminates the need for fuses and relays that are found on earlier lamp oontrol systems. 

The LM is looated in the passenger side kiok panel behind the footwell speaker. This 
looation provides an airflow aoross the external heatsink to oool the LM. 


The LM reduoes a number of oomponents 
that were used in the past. Eliminated are: 

• Numerous relays 

• Flasher unit 

• Crash oontrol unit (relay) 

• Cold oheok relay 



• Dimmer 

• The LM transmits and reoeives status 
information oonoerning light operation. 
The LM transmits bulb status to the oheok 
oontrol module. 

• It also oommunioates to the IKE when 
turn signal, highbeam, and fog light 
indioators need to be aotivated. 

• The LM is informed by ZKE when a 
orash has ooourred or the alarm was 
tripped for headlight / flasher aotivation. 

• When reverse is seleoted, the LM is 
signaled to turn on the baok-up lights. 

All of this oommunioation takes plaoe over 
the Bus system.

Driver Information Systems 
























The LM monitors most of the vehiole’s lighting oirouits with warm and oold oheok funotions. 

• The warm oheok is performed by eleotronio diagnosis at the output stages. 

• Cold oheoking is done by switohing on the light oirouits briefly. In other words, It Is 
a very rapid warm oheok. This is repeated in timed oyoles. 


HOT MONITORING 


OOLD MONITORING 



In order to simplify wiring In the E38, the LM operates the brake lights with inputs received 
from an electronic brake light switch. 

For safety purposes, the LM is designed with emergency functions in case of failure. The 
failure of any one component doesn’t disable the entire system. 


Important vehicle-specific data is stored in the LM. Replacement of this module is covered 
in the IKE module of this training handout. 


BULB MONITORING 

The extent of bulb checking is governed 
by LM coding. Certain monitoring 
functions can be shut down. For 
instance, if Xenon low beam lights are 
installed, low beam cold check is turned 
off. 

Faulty turn signal bulbs and circuits are 
indicted by rapid flashing of the cluster 
indicator.

Input Signals 

Input signals to the lighting module are from the following switohes: 

• Park / low-beam light switoh 

• High-beam/headlight flash switoh 

• Turn signal switoh 

• Fog light switoh 

• Hazard switoh 

• Brake light switoh 

• Dimmer oontrol 

These inputs are ground switohed exoept for the brake light switoh. 

Brake Light Switch - Brake light switoh is a hall-effeot transmitter with three oonneotions. 
The first oonneotion is power, supplied from KL R, with the seoond being ground. The third 
oonneotion is the signal wire to the LM. 

If the brake switoh or it’s oirouits fail, the brake lights will be permanently on from KL R.

Dimmer - The LM oontrol KL 58g (instrument oluster, LCD, and switoh baok lighting). By 
using a pulse-width modulated power supply, dimming oommands are input to the LM by 
way of a potentiometer wired to ground. 

Light switch illumination - A separate circuit is used to back light the symbol of the light 
switch. The symbols are fully illuminated when KL R is switched on and the lights are off. 
After the lights have been turned on, the switch back lighting is reduced to the same 
intensity as KL 58g.

EMERGENCY OPERATION 


If there is a failure of the LM processor, an emergency circuit is activated within the LM. This 
will allow the following lights to function for driving safety. 

• Side marker/tail lights 

• Low-beam lights 

• Brake lights 

• Turn signals 

In emergency operation the following lights will not operate 

• Dimming control (full bright) 

• Hazard lights 

• High-beam lights 

• Headlight flash 

• Fog lights 

• Back-up lights 

The l-BUS communication to the LM will also be interrupted.

Light Check Module (LCM) (E38 and E39 from 9/95 to 9/98) 


The Light Check Module (LCM) combines the functions of the Check Control and Light 
Modules previously installed in the 1995 E38. The LCM provides a oost savings by 
oombining the two funotions into one prooessor. 

It is installed in the right kiok panel where the LM of 
the 95 E38 was installed. Both versions of instrument 
olusters use the LCM for prooessing Cheok Control 
data and oontrolling the exterior lighting funotions of 
the vehiole. The LCM oommunioates with other 
modules over the “I” and “K” busses. Funotions of the 
LCM include: 

• Monitoring of all oheok oontrol inputs 

• Formation and output of oheok oontrol messages or signals 

• Control of all vehiole external lighting 

• Monitoring of all external lighting for operation 

• Instrument panel illumination dimming (KL 58g) signal 

• Control of instrument oluster indioator lights - for high beam, turn signal and fog light 
indioators. 








HIGH CLUSTER CONFIGURATION 


BASE CLUSTER CONFIGURATION 


For proper operation of the Cheok Control and lamp oontrol funotions, the LCM must be 
ooded with the Central Coding Key (ZCS) if replaoement is required.

Light Check Module III (LCM III) (E38, E39, E53 from 9/98) 


The light check module LCM was redesigned as of 9/98 production. It is identified as the 
LCM III. 

The module itself has been redesigned with new semi-oonduotor final stages that produoe 
less heat in operation. This has allowed for the elimination of the protruding heat sink found 
on the previous LCM. 

The total soope of funotion and features has been expanded to improve the oomfort and 
safety for the driver and passengers of the vehiole. Feature and funotional ohanges to the 
LCM III include: 

• Replacement lighting for the parking lights 

• Limiting of output voltage to the lamps 

• Follow Me Home (delayed exit) lighting 

Replacement Lighting 

The LCM oan use substitute bulbs for various lights if a failure should ooour, for example: 

• Front Parking Lights: If one of the parking lamps should fail, the LCM will illuminate 
the turn signal bulb on the affeoted side. The lamp will be dimmed by the LCM so that 
the intensity is the same as the parking lamp. 

• Rear Taillights: If one of the rear taillights should fail, the LCM will switoh on the brake 
lamp on the affeoted side. The lamp will be dimmed to the intensity of the tail lamp. 

Output Voltage Limiting Function 

The output voltage applied to the parking and tail lamps is regulated to inorease the life of 
the lamps. If the voltage at the LCM inoreases over 12.5 volts, the LCM will reduoe the 
voltage to 12 volts. 

Follow Me Home Lighting 

This oonvenienoe feature provides lighting for the driver and passengers to leave the vehiole 
and enter their homes. 

The feature is switohed "ON" by pulling the headlight flasher switoh after the headlights and 
ignition have been switohed OFF. The feature is switohed OFF after a ooded time delay or 
by switohing the ignition ON.

Xenon Headlights 

Overview 


The automotive industry/press often identify xenon lighting systems as HID (high intensity 
disoharge) systems. Xenon headlight teohnology was first introduoed to the US market 
exolusively on the E32 750iL in 1993. BMW xenon headlight systems have evolved and 
their availability as optional equipment has spread throughout the model lineup. 


Blue/White in color and using ellipsoidal technology Xenon headlights provide improved 
night time visibility in all driving conditions compared with traditional Halogen bulb head¬ 
lights. 


Benefits: 

Xenon headlights provide the following benefits: 


• Longer bulb life. Typically, xenon bulbs will last from 3 to 5 times longer than halo¬ 
gen. 


• More light output. Xenon headlights produce from 2.5 to 3 times more lumens than 
halogen. 


• Biue/White light (simulates natural daylight). Xenon bulbs produce a blue/white light 
while halogen bulbs produce a yellow light. The light color of a light source Is measured 
in color temperature (not to be confused with thermal temperature). Color temperature 
is measured in Kelvins (K). The higher the color temperature the whiter the light. 


Natural daylight = 4,500 to 5,000 K 
Xenon headlights = 4,000 to 4,500 K 
Halogen headlights = 3,200 K (yel¬ 
low in color) 

• Better driving visibility. The 

combination of higher lumens and 
higher color temperature provide a 
superior lighting source. 

The beam is wider and brighter in 
front of the vehicle than convention¬ 
al halogen bulbs improving safety 
and driver comfort. 

• Lower operating temperature. 

• Lower power consumption.

Version Identification & System Summaries 


Version identification is specific to vehicle model with the exception of the E38. 

There are two E38 Xenon systems. The early system identified as Generation 2.1 and 
equipped on 95-98 model year 750iL vehicles. The headlight design of this version has a 
flat bottom edge. 

The Generation 3 system was introduced on 1999 model year E38 vehicles. This sys¬ 
tem can be visually identified by the rounded bottom edge. 

LWR: All Xenon systems from M.Y. 99 are also equipped with LWR (Headlight Beam Throw 
Control). This system automatically adjusts the vertical position of the headlight beams to 
compensate for vehicle loads ensuring optimum beam throw. LWR components and func¬ 
tion is described further on in this section. 

Headlight Repiacement Parts: In previous model years, individual replacement parts 
were not available for headlight assemblies. This was due to the Federal Motor Vehicle 
Safety Standards (FMVSS) relating to pitting or corrosion of the reflector components in 
non-sealed beam light assemblies. 

BMW has recently submitted corrosion test data for headlight replacement components 
which have passed the FMVSS providing availability of headlight assembly spare parts. The 
approval has been given for all Bosch headlight assemblies (including halogen systems).

Xenon High Intensity Discharge Bulbs 


Xenon bulbs are identified as D-2S (D=Discharge). 
Xenon bulbs illuminate when an aro of eleotrioal our- 
rent is established between two eleotrodes in the bulb. 

The xenon gas sealed in the bulb reaots to the eleotri- 
oal exoitation and heat generated by the ourrent flow. 
The distinot bluish/white brilliant light is the result of the 
xenon gas reaoting to the oontrolled ourrent flow. 


Phases of Bulb Operation: II II 

Starting Phase: The bulb requires an initial high voltage starting pulse of 18-25kV to estab¬ 
lish the are. 

Warm Up Phase: Onee the are is established the power supply to the bulb is regulated to 
2.6A generating a lamp output of 75 watts. This is the period of operation where the xenon 
gas begins to brightly illuminate. The warm up phase stabilizes the environment in the bulb 
ensuring oontinual ourrent flow aoross the eleotrodes. 

Continuous Phase: Onoe the warm up phase is oompleted, the system switohes to a oon- 
tinuous mode of operation. The supply voltage for the bulb is reduoed and the operating 
power required for oontinual bulb illumination is reduoed to 35 watts whioh is less than a 
oonventional halogen bulb. 

Functional Description 

To regulate the power supply to the bulbs, additional oomponents are required. The xenon 
oontrol modules (1 per light) reoeive operating power from the lighting oontrol module (LCM 
E38/E39/E53) when the headlights are switohed on. The xenon oontrol modules provide 
the regulated power supply to illuminate the bulbs through their phases of operation. 



The igniters establish the eleotrio aros. Integral ooils generate the initial high voltage start¬ 
ing pulses from the oontrol module provided starting voltage. Thereafter they provide a 
olosed oirouit for the regulated power output from the oontrol modules. 





82 

Driver Information Systems 








Xenon Bulb Monitoring 

Xenon bulb function is monitored by the Lighting Control Module (LCM E38/E39/E53). The 
bulbs are only “hot” monitored. Cold monitoring is not possible since the lighting control 
module is not in direct control of the xenon bulb. For this reason cold monitoring for low 
beam headlights is encoded off in the lighting control module for Xenon headlight equipped 
vehicle. 


The lighting control module detects xenon bulb failure via a reduction in current flow to the 
xenon control module. When a bulb fails, the xenon control module’s current consumption 
drops to 60mA indicating unsuccessful xenon bulb illumination. The lighting control mod¬ 
ule then posts the appropriate matrix display message or LED illumination in the Check 
Control Pictogram display of the E53 and E39 Low Instrument Clusters.

Xenon Headlight Testing 


Warning: Xenon headlight control systems generate high output voltage. Prior to head¬ 
light removal or testing observe the vehicle warning labels and be cautious by following 
safeguards to prevent accidental injury. 


Xenon headlight systems (control 
module, igniter and bulb) produced 
prior to 9/98 can be tested with 
Special Test Adapter (P/N 90 88 6 
631 000) in conjunction with the DIS 
Pre-set Measurements System. 

The DIS Measuring System includes all 
of the cable connection information 
and procedures for the test. 


Generation III Xenon lights on vehicles 
produced after 9/98 are tested with a 
different tool. Xenon test adaptor P/N 90 88 6 631 010 is used along with DIS/MoDiC pre¬ 
set measurements “Xenon lights after 9/1998”. 



The Generation III test adaptor uses the 50 amp test cable with both the MoDiC or DISplus.

LWR - Headlight Beam Throw Control 

Overview 

LWR automatically adjusts the vertical positioning of the headlights to maintain optimum 
headlight beam positioning for maximum driving visibility and to prevent undue glare for 
oncoming motorists. The system compensates for vehicle load angle changes (ie: dimin¬ 
ishing reserve of gasoline in fuel tank during a long journey, overloaded cargo weight, etc.) 

LWR has been available on BMW vehicles in other markets for quite some time. Starting 
with the 1999 model year all US market vehicles with Xenon Lights incorporated LWR as 
standard equipment. LWR is not available with standard halogen headlights. 

LWR monitors the vehicle’s loaded angle via two hall effect sensors mounted to the front 
and rear suspension members. When an adjustment is necessary, LWR simultaneously 
activates two stepper motors (one in each headlight assembly). 

The stepper motors drive a threaded rod that moves the lower edge of the headlight carri¬ 
er plate forward and backward (depending on driven direction). The upper edge of the 
headlight carrier plate is fixed on a pivot. The pivoting movement adjusts the vertical posi¬ 
tion of the headlight beam.

Headlight Adjustment Stepper Motors 


One stepper motor is boated inside eaoh 
headlight assembly. 

The 4 wire stepper motors are oontrolled 
by the LWR oontrol eleotronios to ohange 
the vertioal headlight position. 



Functional Description 

The E38/E39 system oomes on-line when the lights are switohed on. 

The LWR oontrol eleotronios then oyoles the stepper motors through their full range of 
motion and stops at a default position. 

The oontrol eleotronios monitors the level sensor input signals to determine the vehioles 
load angle and adjusts the beam position aooordingly. As the vehiole is driven it oontinual- 
ly monitors the level sensor signals and if neoessary updates the headlight beam positions 
every 25 seoonds on the E46 or momentarily on the E38/E39 system. 

Abrupt fluotuations of the sensor signals are filtered to prevent unneoessary adjustment as 
well as monitoring road speed and brake pedal applioation as oorreotion faotors. 

HEADLIGHT ALIGNMENT 

The prooedure for aligning Xenon Headlights with LWR is the same as oonventional halo¬ 
gen bulb systems with one additional step. Wait at least 30 seoonds for the LWR to oyole 
and adjust to it’s calculated position. 

LWR DIAGNOSIS 

The LWR control module of the E38/E39 is diagnosible using the DIS/MoDiC. The head¬ 
lights must be switched on in order to start diagnosis. 

The E46 LSZ incorporates LWR diagnosis program.

E38 Multi-Information Display 

One of the design parameters of the E38 was to oreate a more tranquil interior. 

The objeotives were: 

• Reduoe the number of oontrol buttons 

• Easier operation 

• Displays that are easier to understand 

• More preolse Information 

• Higher visibility of text 

• High Quality appearance 

These objectives are achieved with the multi-information display (MID). 

The MID incorporates the controls for the audio system, telephone and on board computer. 
Since the same format is being used to control each of these systems, operation Is more 
convenient. 

The MID doesn’t perform any calculations. It is an input request / display unit using signals 
to and from the IKE. 

The MID Is designed with two displays 

• Main display- A 32 character display for presentation of primary information 

• Menu Display- 6 small displays for labeling the button functions.

Multi-Function Steering Wheel (MFL) 

The MFL is a system that allows the driver to make various switching requests without 
having to look away from the road or remove a hand from the steering wheel. 

The steering wheel incorporates the control switches for: 


AUDIO / TELEPHONE 



The switches are arranged on the left and right 
side of the Airbag pad. Both of the switch 
panels are micro processors that take the input 
request and produce digital signals that are 
sent to the Multi-Function Steering Wheel 
Control Module. 

As introduced up to 9/96 the MFL-CM is 
located below the left side of the steering 
column behind the knee bolster. 



MFL control 
up to 9/96. 


unit 


After 9/96 the MFL-CM was deleted and the 
electronics were incorporated into the right 
button pad. 

The input signals from the control switches are processed in the MFL and sent to the 
respective control modules for system operation. 


The signals for the control of telephone, audio system and re-circulation operation are 
passed over the l/K-Bus. The signals for cruise control operation are passed to the cruise 
control module or DME through a separate data link from the MFL. 

The MFL-CM contains a fault memory that monitors the steering wheel control switches. 
Diagnosis is carried out with the DIS/MoDiC. 


102 

Driver Information Systems 



Heated Steering Wheel 

The heated steering wheel system consists of the following components: 


• A heating filament Integrated Into the steering 
wheel cover. 

• An NTC temperature sensor, in the filament circuit, 
to regulate the heating current. 

• A push button mounted in the right side MFL key 
pad. 

• The oontrol module located behind the air bag 
assembly. 

• Slip ring assembly for the power and ground supply. 

OPERATION 

When KL 15 Is switohed ON, the heated wheel can be switched ON by pressing the button. 

A green LED illuminates to indicate system operation. Maximum ourrent is supplied and 

heats the filament to Its operating temperature (surfaoe temperature of approximately 90°F). 

The NTO deteots the temperature of the filament and oauses the control module to oyole 

once the wheel is heated. Oycling is carried out with a pulse width modulated signal.

GR II (SPEED CONTROL II) 


INTRODUCTION 

GRII was introduced for the first time on the E38 740i. GR II is a speed control system for 
vehicles not equipped with EML. It is similar in operation to the former system (FGR) found 
on older models. It offers Improved control electronics to ensure that the set speed is 
reached and maintained without the sensation of fast acceleration or deviations of more 
than 1 MPH from the set speed. 

The GR II offers the following advantages: 

• Fatigue-free driving over long distances with a set speed. 

• The constant travel speed results In lower fuel consumption. 

• By setting a speed, speed limits are observed automatically. 

Like most of the other systems in the E38/E39, the GR II utilizes digital signal processing. 
This eliminates the amount of wiring required to achieve system operation and improves the 
reliability of cruise control operation. 

The driver’s request for cruise control functions is activated by the button pads of the MFL. 

An ON / OFF main switch ensures that the cruise control system Is not inadvertently 
engaged while driving the vehicle.

Driver Information Systems 





COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM 


The GR II system consists of the following oomponents: 

MAIN SWITCH (Up to 9/97)- The main switch is mounted 
on the right side of the dash panel below the instrument 
oluster. It produces a momentary ground signal to the GR II 
oontrol module. When pressed the GR II oontrol module 
switches on and the cruise enable indicator lamp in the 
instrument oluster (green in oolor) is illuminated. 

After 9/97 the main switch was deleted and combined with 
the “OFF” switch located on the MFL. 

CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH - The cruise switch pad is 



mounted on the right side of the steering 
wheel. 

All of the request functions ( SET, ACCEL, 
DECEL, RESUME AND OFF) are activated 
from the oruise switoh pad. 

These request inputs are processed by the 
switch and transmitted to the Steering 
Wheel Control Module (MFL-CM) over a 
data link. 

STEERING WHEEL CONTROL MODULE 


Up to 9/96 the MFL-CM is mounted on the 
left side of the steering oolumn behind the 
left side knee bolster. After 9/96 the MFL - 
CM is integrated into the right button pad. 

The cruise control requests are processed 
and transmitted to the GR II cruise control 
module over a dedioated data link. 

CRUISE CONTROL MODULE - The 

oruise oontrol module is mounted in 




105 

Driver Information Systems 








the E-box between the the DME and AGS 
control modules. 

It has one blue 26 pin ELO type connector. 

CRUISE CONTROL ACTUATOR - The 

cruise control actuator Is mounted on the 
left fender well and contains the actuator 


GR II CONTROL MODULE 



motor, feedback potentiometer and actuator clutch. 

The actuator Is connected to the throttle valve with a 
bowden cable parallel to the accelerator cable. 



COMPONENT COMMUNICATION 


The cruise control 
switch pad provides 
momentary ground 
signals and converts 
them Into a dynamic 
digital signal. 


The signal Is sent to 
the steering wheel 
control module and 
passed through a 
gateway to the GR II 
control module. 


The GR II carries 
out the systems 
functions based on 
this dynamic digital 
signal and other 
input signals. 


The actuator is 
controlled by final 
stage activation at 
both sides of the 
motor. 



106 

Driver Information Systems 






























CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH OPERATION 


When the main switch is turned on and the vehicle speed is above 20 mph, the cruise 
control can be set or adjusted at the cruise control switch pad. 



OFF: Pressing the off button will disengage 
the cruise control. The previous set speed 
is stored in memory until it is over written or 
the vehiole is switohed off. 

In addition to switohing off via the oruise 
oontrol switoh on the steering wheel, the 


RESUME: Briefly pressing the resume 
button will oause the vehiole to 
accelerate/decelerate to the stored speed 
value in the cruise control module. 


SET/ACCELERATE/TIP-UP: Pressing the 
set button will engage the cruise system and 
maintain the vehicle’s current speed. 

Pressing and holding the set button will 
oause the vehiole to accelerate. When 
released, the vehicle’s current speed will be 
the set speed. 

Tapping the set button will cause the speed 
to inorease by approx. 1 MPH. The number 
of times the tip feature will funotion is limited 
to 8. 


DECELERATE/TIP-DOWN: Pressing and 
holding the deoelerate button will cause the 
vehicle to slow down. When the button is 
released, the ourrent speed is the new set 
speed. Tapping the button will cause the 
vehicle speed to deorease by approx 1 MPH. 
The number of times the tip feature will 
funotion is limited to 8. 


system oan also be switched off by: 

• Depressing the main switoh on the instrument panel. 

• Applying the brakes. 

• Shifting the transmission into neutral. 


107 

Driver Information Systems 




CRUISE CONTROL MODULE 


The cruise control module contains control logics for smoother operation. The oontrol logins 
prevents the maximum aooeleration/deceleration feel that was oharacterlstlo with the earlier 
FGR system. 

The rate of aooeleration in SET ACCELERATE and RESUME is based on the ourrent road 
speed of the vehicle. The rate of acceleration is high at low vehlole speeds and gradually 
decreases as vehicle speed Increases. This gives the feeling of steady smooth aooeleration. 

The rate of deoeleration when the DECELERATE button pressed is linear until the throttle 
valve closes. The decel rate Is then dependent on the engine braking effeot and road 
oonditions. This results In a smooth speed reduction. 

If the set speed can not be maintained due to unusual operating oonditions (severe up hill 
grades), the control module adopts a special resume mode. Once the unusual operating 
oondition is overcome, the set speed will be resumed at a reduced acceleration rate. This 
feature Is designed to prevent a sensation of rapid accelerating. 

The cruise control module Is conneoted to the ACS oontrol module through a data link. 
When oruise control funotlons are aotivated, the ACS shift program Is adapted to match the 
requirements of the requested cruise control funotlon. For example, when the CR II Is set 
at a speoiflc speed and a severe down hill grade causes the vehicle to overoome the set 
speed the CRN signals the ACS to downshift a gear. This will occur as needed to maintain 
the set speed as closely as possible.

PLAUSIBILITY/SAFETY FEATURES 

To avoid malfunctions or unsafe conditions, the GR II continuously monitors the input and 
output signals. Redundant (or dual signal) processing ensures that the input signals are 
plausible and prevents unsafe cruise control operation from being carried out. The following 
safety measures are also included in the total scope of cruise control operation. 

• Minimum speed - The minimum speed threshold for cruise control operation is 30 km/h 
( approx. 20 MPH). If the speed drops below this value the cruise control will not 
operate. 

• Shut off priority - The brake pedal and transmission neutral switch have priority for 
switching the system off. If a malfunction caused several commands to be called up at 
the same time, the brake switch signal would disengage the system. 

• If the set speed is exceeded by more than 8km/h (approx. 5MPH), the system will dis¬ 
engage by the actuator clutch. When the speed drops below the threshold, the clutch 
will re-engage and the cruise will continue operation. 

• The data link from the cruise control switch is continuously checked for signal integrity. 


110 

Driver Information Systems 




DIAGNOSIS/ENCODING 


Diagnosis of the GR II system is carried out with the DIS tester. The cruise control module 
stores faults that occur with the input/output signals for cruise control operation. The Multi- 
Function steering wheel control module stores faults that occur with the cruise control 
switch. 

There is only one control module for all model versions that use the new GR II system. 
Encoding is required if the control module is changed. To code a new control module, go 
to the coding application in DIS and carry out a coding procedure as stated on the screen. 

An uncoded module will allow limited cruise control operation.

Radio Operation with KL R off 

Operation is possible with the key off on the 053 and OD 53 radios. If the radio is turned 
on with KL R off, it will operate for 16 minutes until the General Module sends the sleep 
oommand. The radio oan be turned on and off as many times desired. 

Diversity Antenna 

Antenna diversity has been adapted to the new generation of radios. When the radio is in 
operation, the diversity oontrol unit is aotivated by the “RAD ON” signal. 

World Frequency Radio 

Radios on vehloles sold In the U.S. are world radios. Speoiflo oountry settings oan be made 
using the servioe mode. The settings are stored in an EEPROM. 

Car Memory 

If programmed, when looking the vehlole using the remote transmitter the: 

• last station 

• Volume setting 

• Last audio mode (Tape, FM, CD etc.) 

are stored according to the key number used. Unlocking the vehicle with the same 
transmitter will restore the settings. There Is a maximum setting for volume which may be 
lower than the setting when the radio was last operated. 

Clock 

Time can also be displayed when KL R is off by pressing the clock button on the 
Radlo/MID. 

Backlighting 

The LCM/LSZ produces two signals for the control of radio backlighting. 

• Hardwired KL 58g 

• Lights on/off over the K/l Bus. 

The radio contains a photo-cell for adjustment of backlighting to ambient conditions.

Reset and Voltage Monitoring 

A radio reset is triggered by under voltage or the internal prooessor monitor. The reset 
funotion restarts the radio, similar to turning it off and baok on again. Operating voltage is 
measured at the KL 30 input. The radio is switohed off if the system voltage exoeeds 17V 
to proteot the radio, it will switoh on when the voltage falls below 16V. 

GAL (Speed Dependent Volume) 

The speed signal from the IKE/KOMBI is available to the radio over the K/l Bus. GAL is not 
a feature on vehioles equipped with DSP. 

Bus Communication 

The radio oommunioates with other modules via the K bus or I Bus dependent on the 
model. The Information shared over the bus line Inoludes: 

• IKE/KOMBI - Terminal status (KL 15, KL R) 

• LCM/LSZ - Lights on 

• IKE/KOMBI link to TXD - Diagnosis 

• MID or BMBT - button or rotary knob status. 

• GM - Key used to look or unlook vehlole 

• MFL - audio oontrols status 

NG radios do not use anti-theft oodes. Operation of the radio is only possible if 
oonneoted to a bus line and the deteotion of at least one other oomponent. 


Multi Information Radio (MIR) 

The Multi-Information Radio (MIR) is used in the E52 Z8 and is the first of the NG series of 
radios. The MIR oontains the radio reoeiver, display soreen, and oontrol panel all in one unit. 
A cassette player is not included. 

The MIR is used to control and display the: 

• GPS-NavIgatlon System 

• Audio system including CD Changer 

• Telephone 

• Outside temperature

Every time the MIR is switched on it looks to see if a navigation computer is installed and 
displays the correct menu options. Text and symbols on the display are generated by the 
navigation computer and transmitted to the MIR via the “Navigation” Bus. If the MIR does 
not detect that a navigation computer is connected, the MIR itself will generate it’s own dis¬ 
play signals. The screen display is monochrome only. 

The navigation elements of the MIR will be discussed in the MK3 module. 

Audio Mixing 

Audio mixing allows the vehicle passengers to listen to navigation instructions without 
muting the radio or CD player. 

On-Board Computer Functions 

Outside temperature is the only on-board computer display possible for the Z8.

PARK DISTANCE CONTROL (PDC) 

INTRODUCTION 


The Park Distance Control is a safety/convenience system that uses ultra-sonic sensors to 
deteot the olose proximity to other objeots when maneuvering the vehicle in tight spaces 
(such as parallel parking or parking in a narrow garage). 

The PDC monitors both the front and rear of the vehicle. The driver is warned, through an 
audible gong system, when the vehicle comes close to another object. As the object gets 
closer, the audible gong inoreases in frequency until a steady tone is produoed. 

As the distanoe to the objeot increase, the steady tone will return to a beep and stop when 
the vehiole moves away from the object. 

The PDC is automatically switched “ON” when the ignition is switohed on. However it does 
not beoome active until the vehicle is shifted into reverse. 

The system can be manually switched “ON/OFF’ with the console mounted switoh.

PDC COMPONENTS 


The PDC system consists of the following oomponents: 

PDC Control Module - Mounted in the right side of the trunk behind the trim oover. 

The PDC oontrol module aotivates the ultrasonio sensors mounted in the bumper oover. 
After aotivation, the oontrol module monitors the signals ooming baok through the sensors. 
Through this signal, the PDC is able to determine the distanoe to any objeots olose to the 
bumpers of the vehiole. As the vehiole oomes olose to an objeot, the PDC oontrol module 
will aotivate the respeotive gong (front/rear) at a speoifio frequenoy tone. 

The PDC oontrol module is linked to the l/K-Bus for the following: 

• Vehiole speed 

• Transmission range seleotion 

• Diagnosis 

Gong/Speaker - The PDC oontrol module aotivates a gong and a speaker to alert the 
driver of the deteoted objeot. The front mounted gong is the existing oheok oontrol gong 
boated under the glove box. The rear mounted speaker is boated under the right side of 
the paroel shelf.

PDC Switch - Mounted in the center console or SZM below the 
IHKA control panel. The system can be switched “ON”/”OFF” at any 
time using the switch. The LED in the switch will flash simultaneously 
with the gong/speaker tones when the system detects an object 


Eight Uitra-sonic Sensors - Four sensors each front and rear, mounted in the bumpers. 
The PDC sensors are small transmitter/receiver modules. They are specifically designed for 
automotive use. The sensors are limited to the following angles of monitoring: 


• 90° on the horizontal plane 

• 60° on the vertical plane 


The vertical angle is reduced to avoid unintentional signalling on steep grades. 
TRANSMITTING MODE 


The control module sends a 40 KHz signal to the sensor. The control module activates the 
sensors in a specific sequence (firing order). The ceramic element in the sensor vibrates and 
produces an ultra-sonic sound wave that is sent out from the bumper. 



DIAPHRAGM 


ULTRA-SONIC WAVES 



CONNECTOR 



PIEZO-CERAMIC 

ELEMENT 


RECEIVING MODE 

If the wave contacts an object, the wave is bounced back to the sensor. The returning wave 
causes the ceramic element to vibrate creating an electrical signal to be fed back to the 
control module. 

The control module determines the distance to the object by the time difference between 
the sent and received ultra-sonic wave signals. The complete send/receive cycle, for one 
sensor lasts approximately 30ms (milli-seconds).

SYSTEM OPERATION 


When KL15 is switched “ON”, the PDC system is switched “ON”, in the standby mode. The 
system performs a self-check of the ultrasonic sensors and oontrol eleotronios. 


When the transmission is shifted into reverse, the system is aotivated and the sensors are 
aotivated in the pre-determined order.

2 


ORDER OF AOTIVATION 




The system stays aotive up to approximately 20 MPH. Above this, the system reverts to the 
standby mode. 

If an objeot is deteoted within the operating range of the sensors, the oontrol module will 
aotlvate the respeotive gong/speaker (front/rear). The sensor olosest to the objeot will 
reoelve additional aotivations to determine if the objeot is getting oloser. 



As the distanoe to the objeot deoreases to approx. 11/2 feet, the oontrol module inoreases 
the aotivation frequenoy of the sensor. The output frequenoy of the gong will inorease 
linearly up to a distanoe of approx. % of a foot. At this time the frequenoy will ohange to a 
constant tone. 

As the distanoe to the objeot inoreases, the frequenoy of the sensor and gong aotivation 
deoreases until the objeot is out of the monitoring range of the sensor.
