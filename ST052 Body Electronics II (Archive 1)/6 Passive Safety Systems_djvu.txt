INTRODUCTION 


PASSIVE SAFETY is a multifaceted concept that deals with the protection of the driver and 
passengers of the vehicle and minimizing the damage to the vehicle once it is involved in a 
collision. 

The foundation for the passive safety of the vehicle is the passenger cell which retains a 
stable shape when the vehicle is involved in an accident. This, coupled with the door anchor¬ 
ing system and crumple zones, serves to provide the best protection possible for the vehicle’s 
occupants. 

The use of the passenger restraint (three point seat belts) systems and airbags further 
enhance this safety cage concept providing the driver and passengers with additional pro¬ 
tection during impacts or collisions. 

BMW introduced the driver’s side air bag in 1985 on the E23 7-Series. The E24 received the 
driver’s side airbag in 1986. The Driver’s airbag continued with the introduction of the E32 - 
7 series introduced in Model Year 1988. 

The Driver’s side airbag was made standard equipment on all models starting with the 1990 
model year. The passenger’s front airbag was added to the 7 and 8 Series vehicles beginning 
with model year 1993. 

The Central “Airbag” system ZAE was introduced in model year 1994 on the 3, 5 and 8 Series 
vehicles. This system carried over to the E38 7 series with its introduction 

The “Multiple Restraint System” MRS was introduced on the 1997 model year E39 and E38s 
as of 3/96 production. The MRS II followed beginning with 5/97 production E38s

Safety precautions when working with airbag circuits 

• Work on the components of the airbag system must always be carried out with the 
battery disconnected. Disconnect and cover the negative terminal of the battery. 
Before disconnecting any airbag it is essential to wait the recommended time: 

• 30 minutes for vehicles up to 9/93 

• 10 seconds for vehicles from 9/93 

• Components of the airbag system should only be checked when properly mounted and 
only using the measurement system of the DIS/MoDiC or a high quality, low impedance 
multi-meter. 

• Always disconnect the negative terminal of the battery when performing any welding or 
body work on the vehicle. 

• When removing airbags temporarily they should be stored in the trunk, face-up, 
with the trunk lid closed. 

• Components of the airbag system that have been dropped from more than 18 inches 
should not be installed in the vehicle. 

• Never treat airbag components or connectors with cleaning agents or conductive 
grease. 

• Airbags must not be thrown into the trash, but must be properly disposed of according 
to local regulations for hazardous materials. Airbags returned to BMW must be shipped 
back in the original packaging of the replacement part. 

• Always dis-arm mechanical seat belt tensioners before working on a seat or 
removing/installing the tensioners. Do not forget to re-arm when finished. 

• Always follow safety precautions in the TIS repair manual instructions.

Passive Safety Systems 




Purpose of the System: 


The MRS III is a passive safety system that is designed to provide the maximum amount of 
driver and occupant protection in the event that the vehicle is involved in a collision. The 
system is designed to activate only the necessary components for protection based on: 

• The severity of the impact. 

• The number and positioning of the passengers. 

• The direction from which the impact occurs. 

The protection is provided by inflated air bags and tubes as well as seat belt tensioning 
devices. 

The Multiple Restraint System (MRS III) employs the use of “SMART” technology. Smart 
technology refers to the control module’s programming which allows for the deployment of 
the airbags, in stages depending on the severity of the impact. Two stage airbags are used 
for both the driver and front passenger which allows for a softer cushioning effect when the 
bags are triggered at lighter impacts. 

In addition to the front air bags, the MRS III incorporates the following restraint/safety 
devices: 

• Front door side impact (thorax) air bags. 

• Head protection air bags (ITS). 

• Rear door side impact (thorax) air bags - optional. 

• Front pyrotechnic seat belt tensioners. 

• Battery safety terminal (BST). 

• Fuel pump cut off message. 

MRS III control modules are manufactured by either Bosch or Temic. While the functional 
operation of both modules are the same. The control modules are not interchangeable from 
a replacement standpoint.

COMPONENTS 


MRS III Control module 

The control module is mounted in the center of the vehicle on the driveshaft tunnel below 
the center console. The control module contains the processing electronics (Smart 
Technology) for triggering of all air bags and pyrotechnic devices installed in the vehicle. Two 
electronic deceleration sensors are installed in the module for crash or impact detection. 

The system is recognized by the 50 pin connector on the control module. There are two 
manufactures of MRS III systems: Bosch and Temic. Definitive verification of the installed 
system is carried out through the identification pages of the diagnostic testers. 

The MRS III is connected to the K-bus (except Z3).

Passive Safety Systems 












Satellite Sensors 


The satellite sensors are mounted below the driver’s 
and passenger’s front seats on the vehicle floor pan . 
The function of the sensors is to detect the severity of 
side impacts and signal the MRS III control module, 
through a pulse modulated signal, in the event of a 
crash. The control module uses this input signal along 
with its internal impact sensor signal to determine the 
deployment of the side/head airbags. 



The satellite sensors of the MRS III use only two wires over the previous three wire sensors 
of the MRS II. The signal is received by the MRS III control unit over the reference voltage 
supply wire. 


As with the control modules, the satellite sensors are manufacturer specific. The Temic sen¬ 
sors will not interchange with the Bosch sensors.

Driver’s front air bag 


The driver’s front airbag is a two stage bag similar to the passenger’s front side bag, intro¬ 
duced on the 1999 model E38/E39s. The complete assembly is mounted beneath the 
cover in the center of the steering wheel as with previous airbags. The assembly contains 
the inert gas generator chamber and two ignition stages (ignitors). 

The airbag consists of: 

• Accumulator/gas generator 

• Two ignition capsules 

• Propellant gas - 13.5% Hydrogen/86.5% Oxygen

Passenger’s front air bag 

The passenger’s front airbag is mounted in the dashboard above the glove box. 

The airbag consists of: 

• Pressure accumulator/gas generator 

• Two ignition capsules - for two stage activation 

• Propellant gas of - 13.5% hydrogen/86.5% oxygen 



PRESSURE ACCUMULATOR

Passive Safety Systems 


Side air bags front and rear (thorax) 

The side airbags are mounted on the inner door frame of the front and rear doors. 
Deployment of the side airbags is dependent on the triggering thresholds programmed in 
the MRS III control module and based on the inputs from the satellite sensors and internal 
crash sensors. 

The side airbags use the same cold gas inflation method as the driver’s and passenger’s 
front bags. 

Rear side airbags arrive de-activated from the factory and can only be enabled upon writ¬ 
ten customer request. This is designed to prevent a risk of injury to small children who may 
be sitting out of position and too close to an airbag in the back seat. 




11 

Passive Safety Systems 











Front Head protection air bags (Inflatable Tubular Structure. ITS) 


The head airbags are similar to the ITS bags used on the MRS II system. They are mount¬ 
ed from the “A” pillar up along the headliner and are anchored behind the “B” pillar. The ITS 
bags of the MRS III system are the cold gas inflation type. The head protection airbags are 
always triggered along with the front side (thorax) bags. 



E38 and E39 Rear Head Protection System 

Rear Head protection is available on E38 and E39 sedans ordered with optional rear side 
airbags. 


The airbags are a cushion (not an ITS) that is 
deployed from behind the C-pillar trim. The 
HPS will not be de-activated along with the side 
airbags from the factory since there is no danger 
to small children sitting out of position. 


A vehicle with rear HPS can be identified by 
observing “HPS” embossed in the C-pillar 
cover. 



12 

Passive Safety Systems 














Battery Safety Terminal (BST) 


The BST is used to disconnect the battery connection to the starter, alternator and charg¬ 
ing post in the event of a collision. This safety measure helps prevents the possibility of a 
short circuit in the engine compartment causing a fire. 

The battery connection to the power distribution box and body electronics is un-affected.

Seat Belt Tensioners 


The seat belt tensioners also make use of 
the inert gas for triggering. The MRS III con¬ 
trol module will deploy the seat belt tension¬ 
ers based on the programmed parameters 
during a collision. 



Seat Occupancy Sensor (SBE) 

The SBE is used as an input to the MRS III control module for detection of a passenger in 
the right front seat. The MRS III uses the input to determine seat belt tensioner and/or front 
airbag deployment thresholds. 



14 

Passive Safety Systems 













MRS III Principle of Operation 


As with previous MRS systems, the triggering thresholds are programmed in the MRS III 
control module. These thresholds are determined by BMW through crash and vehicle test¬ 
ing during the design and development of the vehicle. These thresholds will vary depend¬ 
ing on the vehicle type. 

There are several different thresholds for airbag and safety restraint deployment: 

• Belt pre-tensioner threshold for activation of the seat belt tensioners. 

• Airbag threshold #1 - the first level of activation for the two stage front airbags, always 
deployed first when the front triggering threshold is reached. 

• Airbag threshold #2 - the second level of the two stage front airbags, can be deployed 
simultaneously or after a time delay, depending on the severity of the impact. 

• Rear crash threshold - for activation of the seatbelt tensioners with a rear impact. 

• Battery safety terminal threshold - for activation of the BST with airbag deployment. 

• Side airbag/ITS threshold - for deployment of the side and thorax airbags. 


15 

Passive Safety Systems 



Triggering Thresholds For The Two-Stage Front Air Bags 


The programming of the MRS III includes four triggering thresholds for the two-stage front 
airbags. The triggering of the front airbags is also dependent on whether the seat belts are 
used and if the front passenger seat is detected as occupied. The triggering thresholds for 
the two stage airbags are as follows: 


THRESHOLD 

NO-SEATBELT

If the SBE is faulted when a triggering occurs, the MRS III will react as if the seat is occu¬ 
pied. 

If the signal from the seat belt contacts are defective, the MRS III will deploy as if the belts 
were not buckled. 


16 

Passive Safety Systems 









Triggering Thresholds For The Remaining Safety Devices 


Side Airbags and Head Protection 

The triggering thresholds for the side and head protection airbags is dependent on the sig¬ 
nals from the satellite sensors and the crash sensors in the MRS III control module. The trig¬ 
gering thresholds are independent of the thresholds for the belt tensioners. 

Seat Belt Tensioners 

The triggering of the seat belt tensioners is dependent on the signal from the seat belt con¬ 
tact and the severity of the impact as detected by the control module. 

Battery Safety Terminal 

The BST will deploy in a frontal impact at threshold 2 or greater. The threshold for BST acti¬ 
vation with a side impact is programmed separately in the side deployment criteria. The 
BST will also be deployed if a rear impact threshold is exceeded. 


Fuel Pump Shut-Off Request 

The MRS III system is linked via the K-Bus/CAN Bus to the DME for deactivation of the fuel 
pump. The MRS III will signal the DME via the K-Bus through the instrument cluster and 
CAN Bus to shut off the fuel pump in the event that any crash threshold is exceeded. 


17 

Passive Safety Systems 



Diagnosis 

Diagnosis and troubleshooting of the MRS III system is fault driven and can be accessed 
using the DIS Tester or MoDiC. The control module performs a self test of the system every 
time the ignition is switched on (this includes the satellite sensors and seat occupancy sen¬ 
sor). Any faults with the system will cause the warning lamp in the instrument cluster to 
remain illuminated after the engine is started. 

Installation of a new or replacement control module requires ZCS coding also using the DIS 
or MoDiC. 

When servicing or replacing any MRS III components, always follow precautionary mea¬ 
sures outlined in the repair manual of TIS. this includes disconnecting the battery prior to 
any repair or maintenance work being performed. 

All airbag components are part number specific by model and require verification in the 
EPC to ensure the correct component is being installed.

FRONT PASSENGER AIR BAG ASSEMBLY 


The front airbag is designed to protect the head and upper part of the body in the event of a 
frontal impact. The assemblies consist of a gas generator, ignition pill and the folded airbag. 



SIDE AIR BAG ASSEMBLY (FRONT/REAR) 

The side airbag is designed to protect the upper part of the body (chest/thorax) in 
the event of a side impact. The assembly consists of a gas generator, ignition pill 
and folded airbag. The assembly is bolted to the inner door panel and the trim 
cover incorporates a break away airbag cover.

2-STAGE PASSENGER AIRBAG 


The E38 and E39 received the 2-stage airbag system as of 9/98 production.. 

The passenger's airbag is the only modification to the system. The remainder of the MRS 
II systems are carried over from the 1998 models. The system was modified as follows: 

• New pressure accumulator generator 

• New airbag - volume of 105 liters 

• Two ignition capsules - for two stage activation 

• Propellant gas made from 13.5% hydrogen and 86.5% oxygen 

• Deployed units can be disposed of as scrap metal 

The use of two ignition stages, coupled with the lower volume and new propellant, opti¬ 
mizes the deployment of the airbag and makes it less aggressive when the airbag inflates. 




23 

Passive Safety Systems 



The main component is the gas generator which mounts below the airbag on the passen¬ 
ger's side of the dashboard. The gas generator consists of a pressure chamber with an 
ignition set at each end. A hose connects the airbag with the pressure chamber. 


PRESSURE CHAMBER 

The propellant charge in the chamber is a mixture of approximately 13.5% Hydrogen and 
86.5% Oxygen under pressure. 


IGNITION STAGE ONE 

The main ignition capsule consists of the ignitor, combustion chamber, the impact pin and 
the sealing plate. 

IGNITION STAGE TWO 


COMBUSTION CHAMBER

The second ignition capsule consists of an ignitor, ball seal and combustion tube. 



24 

Passive Safety Systems 









AIRBAG ACTIVATION 


Ignition stage one is always the first to be ignited during an impact. Ignition stage two is 
ignited after a time threshold that is programmed in the MRS II control module. The two 
stage activation is optimized by the airbag’s inflation curve for each model. 

When the ignition capsule is ignited, the impact pin is pushed against the sealing plate and 
the passageway for inflating the airbag is opened. The flame from the ignition capsule 
ignites the propellant gas and the expanding gas is forced through the tube into the airbag. 

After the timed threshold, the second stage is ignited and the ball seal is forced off of its 
seat. The flame from the second stage ignites the propellant on the opposite side of the 
pressure chamber and causes further expansion of the gasses. This ensures that the 
required volume of gas is produced by the pressure chamber to fully inflate the airbag. 


After inflation, the gasses (steam) are allowed to escape from the airbag as with previous 
generations. The escaping gasses are not harmful to the passengers of the vehicle. 




25 

Passive Safety Systems 







HEAD AIRBAG ASSEMBLY (ITS) 


The ITS is designed to protect the head in the event of a side impact. The assembly consists 
of a hermetically sealed rubber tube that is encased by a cross woven tubular nylon material, 
a gas generator and ignition pill. 

The ITS is mounted from the “A” pillar, at the front, to the roof panel slightly behind the “B” 
pillar. The ignitor is mounted to the “A” pillar and is connected to the ITS through a reinforced 
sealed tube. The ITS is stored behind the roof panel trim over the front doors. 

When triggered, the inflation charge causes the diameter of the tube to expand and its length 
to shorten. As the tube expands, it is forced out of the stored position and it drops over the 
side door glass to protect the occupants head against impact. The ITS remains fully inflated 
for several seconds after it is triggered due to the sealed expansion tube. This allows the ITS 
to continue to provide protection in the event of a secondary impact. The tube will deflate 
after the gas cools.

The expandable tube of the ITS is the same for all models. However the securing strap at the 
“B” pillar end is a different length for the different models. For this reason, the ITS is part 
number specific for each model and cannot be interchanged. 



Passive Safety Systems 




























































BATTERY SAFETY TERMINAL (BST) 


The BST is designed to disconnect the battery from the starter, generator and B+ terminal in 
the engine compartment during collisions. This passive safety component is designed to 
reduce the possibility of short circuits to ground occurring from these high amperage cir¬ 
cuits. 

However, other systems that require power to function during and after a crash continue to 
receive power from the positive battery post. These circuits include: 

• ABS - provides continued operation if the vehicle is still in motion 

• MRS II - remains operational for crash protection 

• General Module - for unlocking the vehicle and interior light activation 

• Lamp/Check module - for hazard warning light activation 

• Telephone - provides communication after the crash 

• Board Monitor - with navigation system for communication with Cross Country 
Group for assistance

BST CONSTRUCTION 


The BST is an encapsulated pyrotechnic device that is similar to an airbag in operation. The 
BST contains an ignitor capsule and discharge tube that is mounted in front of the high 
amperage B+ cable. The B+ cable contains a tapered press fit contact that mounts behind 
the gas discharge tube. 

During activation, the tapered B+ cable contact is forced away from the battery post and 
held away by spring tabs within the capsule.

BST ACTIVATION 



Once activated, the ignitor generates a gas charge which is 
directed down the internal discharge tube 


This causes the tapered end of the B+ cable contact to dis¬ 
lodge from its seated position and immediately open the circuit, 




The force of the charge continues to push the cable contact 
away from its seated contact. The spring tabs of the housing 
are compresses as the contact pushes to the end of its travel. 




When the contact hits the end stop of the housing, it bounces 
back against the return spring which prevent it from closing the 
contact with the battery. 


Passive Safety Systems 
























































































































































































SIDE IMPACT SENSORS 


Electronic (piezoelectric) sensors are used for side impact detection. They are mounted at 
the left and right footwell cross members in front of the driver’s and passenger’s front seats. 
The sensors produce a pulse width modulated input signal to the MRS control module for 
side impact detection. The pulse width of the signal decreases in proportion to the severity of 
the impact. 



DRIVER'S SIDE IMPACT CRASH SENSOR 


The control module uses the internal crash sensor as a plausibility check for deployment of 
the side impact and ITS airbags. Both sensors must detect that the trigger threshold has 
been exceeded before the bags will deploy. 



30 

Passive Safety Systems 





































































SEAT OCCUPANCY SENSOR (SBE) 


An occupancy sensor pad is incorporated into the front passenger’s seat cushion. The pad 
is a foil contact sensor that is open when the seat is not occupied. When the seat cushion is 
pressed by the weight of a passenger, the sensor circuit produces a resistance that varies 
with the weight and/or movement. 

This variable resistance signal is input to the Seat Occupancy Module (SBE). The SBE is a 
small signal converter module, mounted under the passenger’s seat. It converts the analog 
signal, from the seat pad into a square wave modulated output signal that is sent to the MRS 
control module. The MRS control module uses this signal for air bag triggering in the event of 
a collision. 



31 

Passive Safety Systems 







SEAT BELT TENSIONERS 


Pyrotechnic seat belt tensioners are used as a method of reducing the spooling effect of the 
seat belts during a collision. 

The seat belt latch is connected to the pyrotechnic device through a cable. The control 
module is responsible for triggering the belt tensioner based on its programmed parameters. 

The pyrotechnic device is similar to an airbag assembly in that when the control module 
triggers the belt tensioner, a small gas charge is ignited in the tensioner assembly and the 
pressure forces the cable to pull the latch tight. 



SEAT BELT SWITCHES 


The seat belt switch signals are input signals used by the control module for its deployment 
logic. Either switch contacts or hall sensors are used for this input, depending on the model 
year.

The design of the MRS/MRS II allows the control module to trigger deployment of the airbags/ 
seat belt tensioners individually as needed. The logic is based on: 

• The severity of the impact 

• The direction of the impact (front/side/rear) 

• The status of the front passenger’s seat 

• The status of the seatbelt contacts for the driver and passengers 

DRIVER’S FRONT AIRBAG 

The deployment threshold for the driver’s front airbag is designed so that minor impact 
forces, will not trigger the airbag, where the seat belt is sufficient to protect the driver. If the 
seat belt is not connected, the driver’s front airbag will deploy to provide the driver with 
protection. 

PASSENGER’S FRONT AIRBAG 

The passenger’s front airbag is dependent on the seat belt contact and the signal from the 
SBE for its deployment. If the passenger’s seat is unoccupied, the airbag will not deploy 
unless a severe collision occurs. 

SIDE AIRBAGS/ITS 

The triggering of the side air bags/ITS depends on the degree of lateral acceleration as 
detected by the side impact sensors. An acceleration sensor in the control module acts as a 
plausibility check for side airbag/ITS deployment. Both sensors must detect that the trigger 
threshold has been exceeded before the airbags/ITS will deploy. The control module also 
looks at the signal from the SBE for deployment of the passenger’s side airbag/ITS.

PYROTECHNIC SEATBELT TENSIONERS 


The triggering of the seatbelt tensioners is dependent on the seatbelt contacts. The tensioners 
will not deploy if the seatbelts are not connected. 

The safety logic of the MRS/MRS II will deploy the airbags in an accident if faults are detected 
with the SBE or seatbelt contact inputs. 


BST TRIGGER LOGIC 

Triggering of the BST requires no additional sensors. The MRS II control module will trigger 
the BST as follows: 

FRONTAL COLLISION: During a frontal collision that involves deployment of any front air 
bag, the BST will also be triggered 

SIDE IMPACT: Depending on the severity of the side impact, the BST may also be acti¬ 
vated . 


REAR IMPACT: Detection of server rear impact will cause the MRS II to activate the seat 
belt tensioners and simultaneously activate the BST 



Passive Safety Systems 


DIAGNOSIS AND SERVICE PROCEDURES 


The control module performs a self test of the restraint system 
every time the ignition is switched on. Any faults with the system’s 
inputs/outputs or processing capabilities will cause the fault lamp 
in the cluster to illuminate. The troubleshooting of the MRS sys¬ 
tem is fault driven and can be accessed using the DIS tester or 
MoDiC. 

Installation of a replacement control module requires ZCS cod¬ 
ing also using the MoDiC or DIS.

When servicing or replacing any MRS 
components, always follow the pre¬ 
cautionary measures outlined in the 
repair manual of TIS. This includes 
disconnecting the battery prior to any 
repair of maintenance work being per¬ 
formed. 

All airbag units , including the ITS as¬ 
semblies are part number specific by 
model. Always use the EPC to verify 
the correct part number for any com¬ 
ponent being replaced. 

A replacement splice kit is available 
for the BST following an impact that 
causes BST activation. The splice kit 
comes complete with instructions for 
cutting and stripping the B+ cable for 
replacement. Follow the instruction 
completely to prevent future voltage 
drop problems in the B+ cable circuit.

SEAT BELT TENSIONERS 


MECHANICAL SEAT BELT TENSIONERS 

The mechanical seat belt tensioner is a simple method of 
countering the effects of the occupant moving forward (seat 
belt stretch) during the sharp deceleration of a collision. 

The seat belt tensioner consists of a cable operated seat 
belt latch, a tension spring and an inertia mechanism. 

When the inertia mechanism is triggered during a collision, 
The linkage releases the tension spring and the seat belt latch 
is pulled downward to tighten the belt across the occupant’s 
body. This action counters the effects of inertia and the “spool¬ 
ing” of the seat belt itself.

AREA OF IMPACT 


The airbag(s) will only activate during a frontal impact and then only when the collision is 
within a 60° arc, equidistant to the vehicle center line. 


The front airbag sensors are spring loaded inertia type switches. The weighted roller will 
move forward, in the event of a frontal impact, closing the contacts of the sensor. 



IMPACT SENSOR SIGNALS 

During a frontal collision of sufficient impact at least one impact sensor and the 
safety sensor in the SRS module will close signalling airbag activation. 

Sufficient impact generally results from a collision with a solid, non-moving ob¬ 
ject at a speed greater than 12 MPH. 


43 

Passive Safety Systems 















SIEMENS OPERATION 


The SRS control module and SRS warning lamp receive power when the ignition 
is switched on (KL R). The control module performs a self check and charges the 
internal capacitor to approximately 35 volts. The capacitor ensures that enough 
power will be available for airbag activation. If the self check is “OK”, the warning 
lamp goes out and the system is ready for activation should the need arise. 

During the instant of activation the capacitor voltage is used to energize the 
ignition pill of each airbag gas generator. The airbag fills rapidly with a nitrogen 
gas (N2) supplying the needed margin of safety.

ROLL-OVER PROTECTION SYSTEM (RPS) 

Model: E36 

Production Date: All E36 convertibles equipped with RPS. 


Objectives 

After completing this module you should be able to: 

• List the components used in the RPS system. 

• Describe how the roll-over sensor detects a deployment threshold. 

• Explain how to retract a deployed roll-bar. 


46 

Passive Safety Systems 




ROLLOVER PROTECTION SYSTEM (RPS) 


The RPS is a passive safety system which, like the SRS, will not deploy until needed. When 
the vehicle is in danger of rolling over, a rollover sensor mounted in the vehicle detects the 
amount of tilt and in a time span of approximately .3 seconds triggers the system to raise 
and lock the roll bars into position. 

The U S market uses the acronym RPS for the roll over protection system while the German 
acronym is URSS. This stands for the German words “Uber Roll Shutz System”, which may 
appear in various publications or on the diagnostic teat equipment. 

The RPS can be reset, in the service shop, in the event of an accident, or inadvertent trigger¬ 
ing of the system. 

The RPS supplements the integral reinforcement bar that is located in the front windshield 
frame/ “A” pillar area. It provides additional protection for passengers of the vehicle, espe¬ 
cially those riding in the rear seats. 

Deployment of the roll bars with the soft top raised, of the hard top installed will not cause 
any damage to the rear window. The plastic covers on the bars is designed to protect the 
window if inadvertent deployment occurs. 



Passive Safety Systems 










RPS COMPONENTS - OPERATION 


The main components of the RPS includes the following: 

TWO ROLL BAR CASSETTES 


The cassettes are positioned in a reinforced body structure, behind the rear seat backrests. 
Each cassette assembly consists of a “U” shaped bar that is guided by low friction plastic 
bushings. The bar is held in the retracted positioned against spring pressure by a lever. The 
lever is solenoid controlled to unlock the bar for deployment. The two springs ensure that the 
bar will deploy quickly to provide adequate protection. 


When deployed, the bar is held in place by a ratchet and lever assembly that locks the bar 
in the raised position.

CONTROL ELECTRONICS 


The control electronics include the monitoring circuits for roll bar operation and two capaci¬ 
tors for triggering the roll bars in the event of an electrical failure.

The clinometer consists of three air bubble floats with LED transmitters and photo transistor/ 
receivers. Two of the floats are positioned on opposing angles of 52° to the horizontal axis of 
the vehicle. 


52 

Passive Safety Systems 


























As the vehicle starts to rollover sideways the air bubble will move across the transmitter/ 
receiver circuit when the angel passes 52°. This will signal the electronics to deploy the roll 
bars. The critical angle for rollover on the E36 convertible is 62°. 



The third air bubble float is positioned at an 
angle of 72° to the longitudinal axis of the 
vehicle. If the vehicle starts to rollover end to 
end, the sensor will cause deployment of the 
rollover bars. 


If the vehicle slips sideways into an obstacle 
(i.e.: the curb) the transverse acceleration is 
retarded rapidly. 


© 



The effect of the vehicle hitting the curb will 
force the air bubble in the float downwards, 
before the vehicle starts to rollover. In doing 
so the air bubble can pass the transmitter/ 
receiver circuit and trigger the deployment of 
the bars. 

This requires an acceleration force of at least 
1.28 “G” lasting for approximately 80ms. 




Passive Safety Systems 











































“G”SENSOR - detects vehicle’s loss of contact with the road surface 

If the vehicle becomes airborne, and the rate of acceleration is 1 “G” or more, the effective 
weight of the vehicle is zero. At this point, the clinometers can no longer detect transverse 
acceleration with respect to the gravitational pull. In this situation, the “G” sensor will act as 
the triggering device for the roll bars. 

The “G” sensor consists of a reed contact, magnet and spring assembly. As long as the 
vehicle is in contact with the road surface, the spring does not have enough tension to 
overcome the weight of the magnet and gravity. 



However, if the vehicle becomes airborne, and weightlessness occurs, the spring will force 
the magnet up which opens the reed contact and triggers the deployment of the roll bars. 


A time period of approximately .3 seconds with a “G” force of approximately 0.9 or less is 
required before the roll bars will deploy.

RPS DIAGNOSIS AND TESTING 


The roll over sensor performs a self check every time the ignition key is switched on. All 
components of the sensor are checked including the output stages for the roll over bar 
solenoids. If a fault is detected, the warning lamp in the cluster is illuminated and the fault is 
logged in the memory of the convertible top control module. 

In the event of a power failure, the capacitors in the sensor can still trigger the solenoids for 
approximately 5 seconds. 

The operation of the roll over protection system must be checked as every inspection I & II. 
The operation of the system is checked using the DIS tester or MoDiC to trigger the deploy¬ 
ment of the roll bars. A signal is sent from the Convertible top module to the roll over sensor 
to activate the system. 

The total number of times the system is activated is stored in the memory of the top module.. 
It can be read out though the tester display. 

After fifty activations of the system, it must be inspected for wear. Refer to the repair manual 
for the proper checking procedures. 




Passive Safety Systems 


























































RETRACTING OF THE ROLL BARS 


The system can be reset (retracted) using the reset 
tool in the vehicle tool kit. The procedure is as fol¬ 
lows: 


• Remove the rear head rest 

• Insert the tool in the slot in front of the roll 
bar 

• Press the tool down to release the ratchet 
lock of the locking lever 

• Push the roll bar down far enough to clear 
the ratchet. 



• Remove the toll and press the roll bar down 
until it locks into the actuator. 


CAUTIONS: 


• Adjustments or repairs to the roll bar cas¬ 
sette and actuators are not permitted 

• Each actuator lever has an overlap 1.2mm. 
This is a critical dimension: > 1.2mm = no 
release 

< 1,2mm = inadvertent release 

• The cassette can only be removed in a re¬ 
leased state. An emergency release is pro¬ 
vided on the actuator. A screwdriver can 
be inserted into the small hole in the ac¬ 
tuator to release the roll bar. 



• Serious injuries could result from deploy¬ 
ment of the roll bas while removing the cas¬ 
sette in an armed state.
