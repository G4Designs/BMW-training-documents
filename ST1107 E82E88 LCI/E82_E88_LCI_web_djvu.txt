Information status and national-market versions 

BMW Group vehicles meet the requirements of the highest safety and quality standards. Changes in 
requirements for environmental protection, customer benefits and design render necessary continu¬ 
ous development of systems and components. Consequently, there may be discrepancies between 
the contents of this document and the vehicles available in the training course. 

This document basically relates to the European version of left hand drive vehicles. Some operating el¬ 
ements or components are arranged differently in right-hand drive vehicles than shown in the graphics 
in this document. Further differences may arise as the result of the equipment specification in specific 
markets or countries.

E82/E88 LCI 
1. Introduction. 

1.1. General information 

The BMW 1 Series Coupe and Convertible have been available since March of 2008. As of March 
2011 production, the 1 Series Coupe and Convertible will undergo a redesign in order to maintain its 
leading position in the market and to fend off the ever increasing number of competitors. 

This model revision, known as LCI (Life Cycle Impulse), includes a pronounced visual upgrade at the 
front and rear plus improvements to details and equipment levels. 

This document is intended to provide a basic understanding of the changes to the 1 series LCI.

2.1.3. Side view 

The side view of the E82 LCI and E88 LCI remains unchanged from the previous models. However, 
there are two new body colors, Vermillion Red Metallic (SA A82) and Marrakesh Brown Metallic (SA 
B09). 

The base wheel sizes have increased by 1 ” to enhance the dynamic nature of the vehicle to 17” 
wheels on the 128i models and 18” wheels on the 135i models. New wheel designs are also available 
including an aero wheel shown below.

2.2. Interior design 

2.2.1. Cockpit 

The elegant cockpit with its typical BMW design has been further upgraded by the high quality and 
harmony of the materials used. 

Both Coupe and Convertible 135i models receive standard power seats with adjustable lumbar sup¬ 
port. 

The light switch cluster and the heating and air conditioning controls have been carried over from the 
E9x. 

All convertibles will receive a standard through-loading system for improved storage capacity. 

The iPod/USB Adapter is now standard on all E82/E88 LCI models.

3. Improved Aerodynamics. 

3.1. Handling dynamics 

From an aerodynamics viewpoint, the E82/E88 LCI incorporates the following aerodynamic features: 

• AirCurtain integrated in the front bumper. Only available on the 128i E82/E88 . 

• Aerodynamic kit standard on the 135i E82/E88 

• Optional "Streamline" 17” aero wheels (SA 2AP). These are directional wheels and are specif¬ 
ic to the different direction of rotation on each side of the car. Only available on the 128i E82/ 
E88. 

These features produce positive effects on fuel consumption and CO 2 emission and represent mea¬ 
surable EfficientDynamics attributes. 

In addition to those two measures, the front bumper has been further aerodynamically optimized in 
this model revision. The effect of that is to enable achievement of a perfect combination of low aero¬ 
dynamic drag coefficient Cd and optimum engine and component cooling. Carefully positioned air 
scoops in the front bumper ensure that cooling system components such as radiator, intercooler and 
discrete oil cooler are provided with the optimum air flow for cooling.

3. Improved Aerodynamics 


3.1.1. AirCurtain 

The AirCurtain is an aerodynamic feature created by an air scoop in the outer area of the front bumper 
leading to a slit-shaped outlet inside the front wheel arch. 

The AirCurtain accelerates high-energy air flow to create a curtain of air that protects the wheel arch 
from air turbulence at the side, thereby reducing the car's aerodynamic drag. The overall improvement 
is approx. ACd = - 0.003.

At present there are no competitors offering a similar feature in this class of vehicle.

3. Improved Aerodynamics 


3.1.2. Aero wheels (SA 2AP) 

The primary aim of the aero wheels is to reduce the rotational resistance created by the air displace¬ 
ment effect of the spokes. With a typical 17-inch wheel, as much as 2 bhp of engine power can be lost 
at a speed of 155 mph. The power loss is equivalent to (ACd = 0.004).

4.1. Exterior lights 

4.1.1. Headlights 

The headlights on the E82/E88 LCI incorporate the white LED "Razorlight" styling light for the first 
time in this configuration. The Razorlight merges directly into the wave guide and ensures a high level 
of visibility on the road. 

The 128i coupe and convertible can be ordered with optional bi-xenon headlights (SA 522) and AHL 
adaptive headlights (SA 524). The 135i coupe and convertible will have bi-xenon headlights and AHL 
adaptive headlights as standard. 

The LED "Razorlight” styling light is only included with bi-xenon headlights (SA 522) and adaptive 
headlights (SA 524). 

As standard, the 128i coupe and convertible is fitted with halogen headlights.

4.1.3. Rear lights 

The rear light units retain the typical BMW L-shape as on the E9x LCI and the FI 0/F07 and F01 mod¬ 
els and are in the form of continuous LED elements. 

Rear taillight units using LED technology combined with fiber optics for distributing the light are avail¬ 
able only if the vehicle is equipped with xenon headlights.
