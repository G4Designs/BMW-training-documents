The measuring cables and sensors used with the Measurement Interface Box (MIB) 
to date, can for the most part, continue to be used. For oscilloscope measurements, 
standard measuring cables are used. These cables can also be used for voltage 
measurements. 

If a measurement is carried out during a diagnostic procedure, the result determined by 
the Integrated Measurement Interface Box is automatically evaluated in the diagnostics 
program and therefore influences the next diagnostics stage. In addition to its use in 
diagnostic procedures, the Integrated Measurement Interface Box can also double as 
a stand-alone and portable digital multimeter. 

The measured values are shown on the display screen. It is possible to measure voltage, 
current, pressure and resistance. Temperature and freguency, however, can only be 
measured as part of diagnostics, i.e. in the procedures of the Integrated Service 
Technical Application. Measured values are not displayed on the display screen if the 
Integrated Measurement Interface Box is being controlled by the Integrated Service 
Technical Application. 

The results are displayed in the Integrated Service Technical Application under 
"Measuring eguipment". Registration and configuration (e.g. of the display language) 
is carried out using the Workshop System Management. Software updates are similarly 
managed using the Workshop System Management and are implemented automatically 
when necessary. 

Other important features include: 

• Hard drive capacity: 20 GB 

• RAM: 512 MB 

• Rechargeable battery life: Up to 3 hours 

• Connection to workshop network by: 

- Cable 

- Wireless

The Integrated Measurement Interface Box also has a USB interface, which will be used 
for vehicle diagnostics in the future.

Multimeter 


The "Multimeter" tab contains display and control elements for two multimeters that are 
separately displayed in the content range, divided by a green line. Besides individual 
measurements, the devices also support parallel measurement via Probe 1 and Probe 2 
for resistance, direct/alternating voltage, direct/alternating current, as well as the diode 
test. Furthermore, parallel measurements with Probe 1 or 2, as well as a sensor (kV 
clip/RZV cable [resting voltage cable], clip-on ammeter, pressure sensor, or temperature 
sensor), are possible. 

Each multimeter consists of a display area (left) and a settings area (right). With the "Quit 
measuring devices" button in the action line, you can return to the "Measuring devices" 
tab.

IMIB 



























Display Range 

The display area shows the measured value with its physical unit of measurement high¬ 
lighted in color. The measured values of Multimeter 1 (connected with Probe 1 by default) 
are displayed in green; Multimeter 2 (connected with probe 2 by default) displays mea¬ 
sured values in red. 

Under the display area, there are two buttons with the following functions: 

0 MIN/MAX: If you click this button, the two limit values are shown at the bottom left of 
the display window. "MIN" corresponds to the lowest value in the period 
of measurement, e.g. "Imin = 6 A". "MAX" shows the highest value, e.g. 
"Imax = 7 A". 

0 Freeze-frame: This function "freezes" the measurement; the last measurement is 
thus retained. You can also trigger the freeze-frame function at the 
probe and then read the value at the tester. If you click the button a 
second time, the measured values continue to be displayed. 


Range 

The setting range is located at the bottom right of the mask, divided into an area for 
Multimeter 1 (top) and Multimeter 2 (bottom). At the top, there are six buttons for select¬ 
ing a measurement source (probes and sensors). Under these are the "Mode" zones for 
setting the measurement type and "Range" for setting the measurement range. 

Source (measurement source) 

The following measurement sources are used: 

• Probe 1: for resistors, direct/alternating voltage, direct/alternating current, diode tests. 

• Probe 2: for resistors, direct/alternating voltage, direct/alternating current, diode tests. 

• kV clip/RZV cable: for high voltage measurements in ignition systems. 

• Clip-on ammeter: for direct and alternating current. 

• Pressure sensor: for pressure measurements, e.g. cylinder 1 compression. 

• Temperature sensor: for temperature measurements in liquids, e.g. oil temperature. 
After the source has been selected, the button will be displayed in the color of the mask. 


11 

IMIB 



Mode 

The possible settings change according to the selected source. After selection of a 
mode, e.g. "DC V", it is highlighted in the color of the mask. 

The abbreviations are defined below: 

• Q : Resistor measurement 

• AC V: Alternating voltage measurement 

• DC V: Direct voltage measurement 

• AC A: Alternating current measurement 

• DC A: Direct current measurement 

• -w- : Diode test 


Range 

The range changes according to the source. The measuring device will automatically be 
set to the highest measurement range by default; however, you can manually adjust it if 
reguired. 

Note: If the displayed measurement value lies outside the manually selected 
range, the display changes to "++++" or "-

IMIB 




Oscilloscope 

Two time-dependent variables are measured with the dual channel oscilloscope. The 
screen displays measured and processed curves and results in the left (display) area. 
The IMIB settings can be adjusted in the right (setting) area. 



"Oscilloscope" tab 


Display Area 

The display area is divided into the following: 

• Graph display: for graphical plots of curves. 

• Measured value display: for numerical display of voltage and time values. 


14 

IMIB 























































Graph Display 

With linear scaling, the graph display is divided into a 10 x 8 grid. With logarithmic scaling, 
the y-axis is divided into 4 groups of 10; the x-axis remains unchanged. 



Graph display 


m Differential 
cursor 


Depending on the application, a trigger mark, two cursors and a progress bar on the top 
edge will appear in the graph plot. 

So that you can distinguish between curves and correctly assign their settings, the curve 
from Channel 1 (CHI) is green and the curve from Channel 2 (CH2) is red. Cursors, trig¬ 
ger marks and progress bars are white. 

The frequency of graph updates depends on the sampling rate set on the oscilloscope. 
The following presets apply for individual areas: 

• Sampling rate < 100 s: Time interval 10 ms. 

• 100 s < sampling rate < 1 s: Time interval 300 ms. 

• Sampling rate > 1 s: Record mode (Record). The curve progresses in linear 
steps of approx. 4 pixels from right to left and is recorded at the same time.

The "Cursor" settings group contains the following buttons: 

0 CHI, CH2: When clicking and locking a button, the two cursors will appear in the sec¬ 
ond and eighth grid line of the graph display for the respective curve (reference and dif¬ 
ference). The cursors can only be displayed for one channel respectively: For example, if 
you lock the "CH2" button, then the "CHI" button will be simultaneously unlocked. If you 
click the same button once more, the measuring cursors will be faded out again. You can 
move the reference cursor along the x-axis with the two reference arrow keys and the dif¬ 
ferential cursor by using the differential arrow keys. The cursors move pixel by pixel; their 
speed increases the longer you hold the arrow key down. As soon as a cursor reaches 
the edge of a measurement curve, the respective arrow key can no longer be operated. 

0 Coupled: is activated only if one of the "CHI" or "CH2" buttons, is active. If the 
"Coupled" button is locked, then the differential cursor moves when the differential cursor 
is displaced, maintaining constant spacing. With the differential arrow keys, you can con¬ 
tinue to displace the differential cursor separately. If you hide the cursor for one channel 
and later show it again (cursor key locked), the "Coupled" button adopts the most recent¬ 
ly displayed state. 


17 

IMIB 








































































The following applications are linked with the cursor function: 

• Measuring curves: The oscilloscope determines the following points 
and shows the values in the measured value display: 

• Intersection of reference cursor with the curve ("Ref.Cur") 

• Interface of differential cursor with the curve ("Diff.Cur") 

• Voltage difference between the reference and differential cursor ("Cur") 

• Output of Set values: When you select the "CHI" or "CH2" button in the 
cursor settings group 

The following countervalues are entered into the measured value display: 

• Period ("t") 

• Freguency ("1/t") 

• Sample ratio of selected channel ("t/T") 

• Time lag between reference and differential cursor ("t"). 

• Zooming compresses the curves. In compressed mode, you can 
select and zoom in on a curve section.

The "Display" settings group contains the following buttons: 

0 Log: logarithmic scaling on/off, as default y-values are presented in linear fashion. When 
clicking and locking the "Log" button , the y-axis switches to logarithmic scaling in value 
ranges up to 4 groups of 10. Negative measurements are zeroed in the logarithmic dis¬ 
play. Clicking the button a second time switches back to linear scaling. 

0 Record: record mode on/off. When clicking and locking the "Record" button, the record 
mode will be started. The process can be interrupted by once again clicking on the 
"Record" button. The record mode is automatically stopped in the "Single" trigger mode 
if a trigger event occurs (trigger level, ramp). All settings for the "Channel", "Time" and 
"Trigger" groups are locked. The record mode is only accessible if the "Compress" but¬ 
ton is not locked. 

0 Compress: scales the x-axis over the entire curve. When clicking and locking the 
"Compress" button, the x-axis is scaled so that the entire and most recently recorded 
curve can be shown in the measured graph display. The "Record" button and those for 
the trigger mode (Auto, Normal, Single) are deactivated. The "Compress" button can only 
be clicked after a curve has been recorded. Mark a section of the compressed curve 
(either Channel 1 or 2) with the reference and differential cursor. Click the "Compress" 
button. The oscilloscope zooms in on the marked curve section to the normal scaling 
of the x-axis.

By increasing the sampling rate with the "<Time>/Div" arrow keys, you can zoom in 
further into a curve section until the curve is completely expanded. 

With the "<Range>/Div" arrow keys, you can extend the curve in the vertical direction. 

This does not enhance the resolution, however. 

The settings group contains display ranges for the set values and two arrow keys which 
can be used to adjust the set values. 

0 Position: You can move the section along the x-axis if the recorded curve can no longer 
be completely displayed in the measurement value display. With the arrow keys, you can 
zoom in/zoom out the section from 0 to 100% along the saved curve. The longer you 
hold the arrow key down, the faster the section moves. The percentage value indicates in 
which section of the saved area the section is located. 



As long as the reference and differential cursors are displayed (with channel CHI or CH2 
in the "Cursor" settings group selected), the section can only be displaced between the 
two cursors. To scroll through the entire memory, you have to deselect both channels in 
the "Cursor" settings group 


The visible section is displayed in the graph 
display by the size and position of the status 
bar at the top of the display. 

0 <Time>/Div: This is where you define the 
sampling rate, in other words, it determines 
the horizontal scale of the graph which 
appears on the oscilloscope screen. The 
associated unit, e.g. "ms/Div", is displayed 
via the left arrow key.

Select a sensor with the arrow keys. If the sensor is not yet connected, a corresponding 
message appears. 

0 Offset: The signal displayed on Channel 1 or 2 can be respectively overlaid with a 
constant component or a DC voltage (offset). The offset value is preset to 
0%; you can change the range ±100% of the y-axis. 

0 <Measurement range>/Div: This setting designates the group of measurement 

ranges and depends on the sensor selected. Set the 
range with the arrow keys; it will be displayed in the 
associated display range. The physical unit is above 
the left-hand arrow key. 

The set range is transferred to the y-axis. 

0 Coupling: Signal coupling for the corresponding channel. 

The following settings are possible: 

0 GND (Ground): The input is decoupled from the sensor and is grounded. 

0 AC (Alternating Current): Only alternating current components are represent in the 

curve. 

0 DC (Direct Current): Alternating and direct current components are represented in 

the curve. 

The buttons for the non-available coupling types are gray. 

Trigger 

In the "Trigger" area, you can set the source, the (trigger) position, the trigger value (level), 
the slope and the mode. The current trigger position and trigger value are indicated by an 
arrow, with the arrow direction indicating slope. 

0 Source: The group of sensors. A trigger signal is transmitted to the oscilloscope 
via a sensor. 

Select from the possible sensors: 

• Probe 1 and/or 2 

• kV clip/RVZ cable 

• 50 A or 1000 A clip-on ammeters

Select a sensor using the arrow keys. If the sensor is not yet connected, a corresponding 
message will appear. 

0 Position: With the arrow keys, you can displace the trigger time along the x-axis 

between 10% and 90% along the graph display. The default setting is 50%; 
the signal in this case is triggered in the middle of the graph display. 


0 Level: With the arrow keys, you set the amplitude at which triggering should occur 
as a percentage of the y-axis. 

0 Slope: Defines whether triggering should occur on the positive or negative slope, 

whereby only one switch ("pos" or "neg") can be activated at one time. If both 
buttons are inactive, the trigger is activated whenever the set trigger value is 
reached, regardless of whether this occurs on the rising or falling slope. 


0 Mode: Except in record mode, a trigger mode is always active. The default setting is 
"Auto". 


0 Auto: If no trigger is set, then an untriggered image will be shown. 

0 Norm: Prereguisite for a display is the availability of a trigger. 

0 Single: Stops the oscilloscope measurement after the first valid trigger signal. If you 

click the "Single" button again, the mode is reactivated and recording of anoth¬ 
er measuring signal can begin.

Record Mode 

In record mode, the measurements are recorded without being triggered continuously 
and temporarily stored. 

Recording begins when you click the "Record" button. During recording, the latest mea¬ 
surements are presented in the graph display. The remaining memory capacity is contin¬ 
uously displayed as a percentage in the measurement display. 

The trigger mode cannot be reactivated until the record mode has been stopped by 
clicking the "Record" button. 

Recording may be stopped by the following events: 

• Repeated clicking of the Record button 

• Reaching of the preset trigger level (depending on the trigger mode) 

• Memory full 

After completion (manual or automatic) of data recording, the "Compress" button is acti¬ 
vated and the entire curve along the x-axis is compressed to the width of the graph. 
Various tools are available for closer examination of the curve, using cursor settings and 
the adjustment of values under "Time".

Action Line 

The action line contains the following buttons: 

0 Save settings: You can save oscilloscope settings. Saved settings are stored on the 
ISIS workshop server and are thus available on every ISID that is linked 
to the respective ISIS in online mode. You start the operation by select¬ 
ing the "Save settings" button in the action line. The "Save oscillo¬ 
scope settings" mask appears. Enter a name in the "Save under" field 
under which the settings should be saved. The workshop system

Signals 

The signals feed defined direct currents as well as direct and alternating voltages to the 
sensors and leads or simulate resistances. You can observe the effects with measuring 
instruments. 

With the "Signals" tab, you parameterize the signal functions of the IMIB.

The content range contains a settings group for each of the signal sources, i.e. direct 
voltage, generator, direct current and simulator. 

The settings for "Amplitude", "Freguency", "Sample ratio" and "Resistor" consist respec¬ 
tively of a display range for the set value and two arrow keys left and right, with which you 
can adjust the signal. The longer you hold the arrow key down, the faster the signal value 
changes. 

The setting "Signal" provides a separate button for the "Rectangular" and "Sinusoidal" 
signal types. 

Select a signal by clicking its heading. It is not possible to make a multiple selection. 

If you switch to Multimeter or Oscilloscope and then return to Signals, then the most 
recent setting is retained. However, if you guitthe Measuring instruments and then call up 
Signals again, then the settings will be reset to the default values. 

The buttons in the action line have the following functions: 

• Start/Stop: Transmits the set signals to the IMIB. In the message line, a message 

appears, indicating that the signals are active. When you click the button 
a second time, you switch the signals off again. 

• Exit measuring devices: Switches active signals off, sets the measuring instruments 

back to the IMIB, and returns to the "Measuring instru¬ 
ments" tab.
