BMW Model Identification 


BMW uses two different methods of identifying its products: 

• External Designations are for customers to identify BMW products. 

These are marketing designations commonly referred to as trunk badges. 

• Internal Designations are used by BMW and center personnel to identify a 
particular production version. 


External Designations 

External designations located on the 
trunk or tailgate are the model names. 

Customers and the public identify 
BMW products by these names. 

The trunk badges consist of a combination of numbers and letters. The badge shown is 
typical of 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7 series vehicles. The first digit represents the series identifica¬ 
tion. The last two digits mark the engine displacement. The i represents the type of fuel 
delivery (injected). 

The external designations are created by the sales and marketing department to position 
each model in a certain target segment of the vehicle sales market. 

Occasionally there are examples where the actual engine displacement does not match 
the designation. This is a marketing decision to continue familiar name recognition from 
one version to the next and to create a spacing between models. 



Examples are: 

• E71 X6 xDrive50i - 4.4liter 

• E9x 335i - 3.0 liter 

• F01/F02 750i/Li - 4.4 liter 



There is another series of badges that begin with a letter followed by a single digit. 
These are found on: 


• Roadsters (E52, E85, E89) 

• SAV (E53, E70, E83) 

• SAC (E71, E72) 

• Motorsport 



Additional letters sometime follow the badge numbers and are used to further identify 
each model. Examples include: 


• xDrive - all-wheel drive 

• X - all-wheel drive 

• sDrive -sport/standard drive 

• s - sport 

• L - long wheel base 


• i - Fuel Injected 

• M - Motorsport 

• ActiveHybrid 

• GT - Gran Turismo 


• d - Diesel 

• e - eta 

• t - touring/sports wagon 

• C or c - Coupe or Cabrio

Examples of these badges are: 



Internal Designations 

Internal designations are created and used by the Engineering and Technical Develop¬ 
ment departments to identify a new model during the design of the car. The use of the 
internal designations carries over to the Technical Support groups after production. 

Internal designations refer to the entire vehicle series of a particular body design. For 
example, the E90 designation describes all 3 series cars of that design. BMW products 
start with an “E” (as of 2009 we started using the letter “F” on some of our vehicles) and 
are followed by a two digit number. Not all design concepts make production, so internal 
designations are usually not sequential. The table on the next page lists the internal des¬ 
ignations, series number and the years produced. 

The E designations can include an additional number separated by a slash (/) to indicate 
a different model within a particular chassis group. Example: 

• E36/7- Z3 • E46/3- Sport Wagon • E46/16- All-Wheel Drive 

• E36/5- 318ti • E46/2-Coupe

Vehicle Identification Numbers 


Vehicle Identification Numbers are referred to as the VIN. BMW utilizes a VIN with a 17 
character structure. The characters are grouped to include multiple information as follows: 


WBA BR33 4 4 Y E A82019 

Digit 1 -3 are the manufacturer’s code: -1 

WBA = BMW Cars and SAVs 
WBS = Motorsport 

4US = Spartanburg (not used since 1999) 

Digits 4-7 are the model code: -1 

Digit 8 is the restraint system identifier: -* - 

0 = Seat belts 

1 = Seat belts and Driver airbag 

2 = Seat belts and Dual airbags 

3 = Seat belts, Second generation dual front airbags 

4 = Seat belts, Dual-stage advanced front airbags 

Digit 9 is a check digit determined by VIN: -1 

Digit 10 is the model year identifier (started in 1980): - 

A = 1980 model year, seguentially progresses every year. I,0,Q,U and Z 
are not used because they can be mistaken for numbers. 


A=1980 

G=1986 

N=1992 

W=1998 

4=2004 

A=2010 

B=1981

E=2014 

F=1985 

M=1991 

V=1997 

3=2003 

9=2009 

F=2015 


Digit 11 is the Plant code: - 

A, F, K = (Plant 1.1) Munich 

C, B, D, G = (Plant 2.4) Dingolfing 

E, J, P = (Plant 6.1) Regensburg 

L, M = (Plant 10) Spartanburg 

N = (Plant 9) Rosslyn 

W = (Plant) Graz, Austria 

V = (Plant) Leipzig 

Digits 12-17 are the Seguential production number:

VIN Location on Vehicle 

The VIN is located on the vehicle in the following locations: 

• Left lower corner of the instrument panel. This is viewed through the windshield 
from outside the vehicle. 

• B pillar compliance label. On the drivers side doorjamb. 

Additionally the VIN is stamped into the chassis in one of two locations: 

• Under the hood on right side of engine compartment bulkhead. 

• Under the hood on right side shock tower.

The production date of the vehicle is included in the B pillar compliance label. 

Production date information is required quite often when a repair procedure affects only 
a certain range of vehicles. The range is based on production dates. 

The date shown on the label reflects the actual month and year the vehicle was pro¬ 
duced. It is not a model year indicator.

Vehicle Production Anti-Theft Labels 

Since 1987, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requires that the 
VIN be marked on specific parts of the car during manufacture for theft identification. Some 
models are exempt if the total number of vehicles imported is below a certain number. 

If equipped, the label is also a reference point for the VIN. The label is placed on the fol¬ 
lowing locations: 

• Engine • Transmission 

• Hood • Trunk lid 

• Front bumper • Rear Bumper 

• Front Fenders • Doors 

• Quarter panels. • Shock Tower 

• Firewall 




*Please reference S.I.B 00 21 86 (1267) dated June 1990 for more information on 
Anti-theft labels.

Paint Code Identification 


When ordering painted parts it is necessary to obtain the vehicle’s paint code. The paint 
code consists of a three digit number printed on the color identification tag as shown 
below. All color identification tags are located in the engine compartment.

Engine Identification 

BMW engines are identified by a combined alpha-numeric code. Like the internal model 
designation it is a code used by the Engineering and Technical development teams dur¬ 
ing the design stages of the engine: 

• M - for standard production engines 

• S - for Motorsport engines (Motorsport is a separate division of BMW) 

• N -for New Generation engines 

After the letter there are two digits that identify the engine. The table below lists engines 
by number of cylinders. Please refer to the BMW Technical Information Card for individ¬ 
ual model application.

Engine Numbering System 

In order to organize and classify the engines developed by BMW, a numbering system 
has been developed. 


Digit 1 is the engine developer and/or generation: 
A = Motorcycle 

M = BMW Group (Old Generation) 

N = BMW Group (New Generation) 

G H K L T = BMW Group (Future Generation) 
P = BMW Motorsport 
S = BMW M GmbH 


Digit 2 is the engine type: 
Combustion Engines 

4 = in-line 4 

5 = in-line 6 

6 = V8 

7 = VI2 

8 = V10 


Electric Motors 
A = Asynchronous 
P = Permanent Magnet 
R = Switched Reluctance 
S = Synchronous 
T = Transversal flow 


N 5 5 B 30 M 0 


Digit 3 is the engine technology: - 

Digit 4 is working procedure and/or fuel: -<■- 

B = Gasoline 
D - Diesel 
E = Electric 
G = Natural Gas 
H = Hydrogen 
M = Methanol 
X = Electronic - Diesel 
Y = Electronic - Gasoline 

Digits 5&6 are the displacement value: -<■- 

Digit 7 is the performance class: -<■- 

S = Super performance 

T = Top performance class 

0 = Upper performance class (standard) 

M = Intermediate performance class 
U = Lower one performance class 
K= Smallest one performance class 

Digit 8 is release relevant information: - 

0 = New Development 

1 -9 = Revision (such as technical update or cost project) 

36 

Introduction to BMW 



Engine Displacement Identification 

In technical literature usually only the group of 3 digits 
that follow the basic engine code is utilized for engine 
identification. These digits identify the required fuel 
type of the engine and it’s displacement. 


ENGINE CODE 


M54-B30 


30 = 3.0 LITER 
DISPLACEMENT 



B = BENZINE, GERMAN 
FOR GASOLINE 


Engine displacement can always be determined by the engine specification plate. 

This plate is stamped onto the engines in various locations. There is a lot of information 
included in this identification plate. The breakdown of the information on this plate is as 
follows: 


30 8S 1 11A 

0000 A 000 
11 00 - 1 742 268 

V___ _ J 


Powerplant Identification Code 
Engine Number 
Part Number 


Powerplant Identification Number 


308S1 11 A 


Digits 1 -2 are the displacement value of the engine: - 

30 = 3.0 Liter 

Digit 3 is the number of cylinders: -<■- 

8 = 8 Cylinders 

Digit 4 is the engine concept: -<- 

D = Diesel (naturally aspirated and direct injection) 

E = Fuel injection 

K= Catalytic Converter (M10, M20, and M30 engines only) 
S = 4-valve technology 
T = Turbo (gasoline and diesel versions) 

V = Carburetor 

Digit 5 is a differentiation index: -<■- 

Digits 6-7 are the variant numbers: - 

Digit 8 is the identification for the engine: - 

A = Remanufactured engine 
N = New engine 


37 

Introduction to BMW 



















In recent time the Powerplant Identification Code changed from 8 digit to 7 digit. This 
mark is located on the crankcase to ensure unambiguous identification and classification. 
This engine identification is also necessary for approval by government authorities. 
Decisive here are the first seven positions. The first 6 positions are the same as the 
engine designation.

Transmission Identification 


BMW uses three different transmission suppliers. 

1. Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen: A German supplier of BMW transmissions. 
Commonly referred to as ZF. ZF manufactures both manual and automatic trans¬ 
missions. 

2. Getrag: A German supplier of BMW manual transmissions. 

3. Hydramatic: A French supplier of BMW automatic transmissions. Hydramatic is a 
manufacturing division of General Motors Powertrain. 

BMW has developed an internal numbering system for their transmissions for parts 
ordering, information research, and identification. Each manufacturer uses their own 
internal identification system. 

The breakdown of the BMW transmission identification code is as follows: 

BMW Identification Code Breakdown 

A 5 S 440 Z 

Digit 1 is the transmission type: - 

A = Automatic 
S = Standard (manual) 

Digit 2 is the number of gears: -1 

Digit 3 is a reference for the final drive ratio: - 

S = Top gear overdrive 
D = Top gear direct drive 

Digits 4-6 are a torgue rating index: - 

Digit 7 identifies the manufacturer: -<- 

Z = ZF 

R = Hydramatic 
G - Getrag 


ZF Identification Code Breakdown

Digits 2-3 refer to the type of transmission: - 

HP = Hydraulic planetary 

Digits 4-5 are an internal ZF designation: - 



Introduction to BMW 




Automatic Transmissions 


In technical documentation, the transmission designation is used to ensure the unam¬ 
biguous identification of the transmission. Frequently, however, only an abbreviation is 
used. This short form is used to assign a transmission to a transmission family. For exam¬ 
ple, we often talk about the GA8HP transmission family, which consists of several trans¬ 
missions such as the GA8HP45Z, the GA8HP70Z and the GA8HP90Z.

In the technical documentation, the transmission designation is used to ensure the 
unambiguous identification of the transmission. Frequently, however, only an abbreviation 
is used. Thus we frequently speak of the I transmission, K transmission or G transmission.

Basic BMW Abbreviations and Acronyms 


Throughout your career as a BMW Group Service Technician you will come across many 
acronyms in the various Technical publications. Even BMW is an acronym. An acronym 
is a word formed from the initial letters of a longer word. In the next two pages there is a 
list of acronyms describing various systems on BMW Group automobiles and SAVs. 

Remember this is only a partial list. The BMW Group is a dynamic company and is 
always adding new systems to its products. Look for new systems and acronyms with 
new Technical Training courses, Service Information, and Technical Information Bulletins. 

You can also refer to ISTA “FTD 000 103035 Abbreviations All models” for 
more than 1500 definitions.
