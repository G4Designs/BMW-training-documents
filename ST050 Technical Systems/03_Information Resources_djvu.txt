Service Information Bulletins 


The purpose of the Service Information Bulletin is to communicate with the BMW 
Center Service Department. The SB’s are written by the Quality and Service 
Engineering Department and are designed to update/inform technicians and 
after-sales personnel concerning: 

• Current Product Quality Solutions 

• Diagnostic Eguipment and Special Tool Information 

• Service Measures, Service Actions and Recalls 

• Administrative Procedures

Service Actions and Recalls 

There are two major kinds of service bulletins: 

• Service Actions (Campaigns) 

• Recalls 

Service Information Bulletins that contain Service Actions and Federal Safety and 
Emissions Recalls must be treated with greater urgency than a normal informational 
bulletin. Every effort should be made to ensure that vehicles that fall under a certain 
Service Action or Recall is modified or repaired as quickly as possible. 

The Key Reader software (SAM 2) or the DCS (Dealer Communication System) Vehicle 
Report is used to determine if a particular vehicle is affected or not. DCS reports should 
be run by the service advisor or dispatcher each time a vehicle is in the workshop for 
maintenance or repairs. The DCS report will include the code number and the applicable 
SIB reference. 

■ Service Action 

Service Actions, commonly are situations that BMW has determined require a modifica¬ 
tion or repair to a selected group of vehicles. 

These concerns are not limited to safety or emissions but may involve anything that may 
be a potential cause of dissatisfaction for the vehicle owner. 

BMW takes this pro-active approach to ensure that their customers are not inconve¬ 
nienced by future problems when a production, manufacturing or design problem has 
been discovered. 

Service Actions therefore allow the owners of older vehicles to enjoy some of the 
production improvements made on later vehicles. 

Customers should be made aware of Service Actions that are applicable to their vehicles 
when the vehicles is in the workshop for service so that the necessary arrangements can 
be made to perform the corrective measure. 

Service Actions are covered by the BMW New Vehicle Limited Warranty or Emissions 
Warranty.

■ Recalls 

Recalls apply only to systems which affect passenger safety or the ability of the vehicle 
to meet Federal (EPA) or State (e.g. CARB) emissions standards. The federal and state 
agencies which oversee Highway Safety and Emissions have the authority to issue stan¬ 
dards and require manufacturers to recall vehicles which do not meet those standards. 

Many recalls are initiated voluntarily. Through their own testing and information gathering 
systems, manufacturers sometimes discover that a defect exists or that standards have 
not been met. Under Federal law, the manufacturer is required to report these findings to 
the Government and take action to correct them. 

Unlike a Service Action, a recall requires that every owner of a potentially affected vehicle 
be notified by mail as soon as possible. The letter must include a brief description of the 
defect and any potential hazards created by the problem. The names of vehicle owners 
are obtained from individual State DMV (department of motor vehicle) offices. 

In addition to the letters, BMW centers must inform their customers about the recall 
when they appear on the SAM 2 or DCS report. 

Vehicles that are out of the normal warranty period may still have the repairs made free of 
charge as long as the time period for the recall has not expired. 

After the Service Action or Recall has been completed, apply a campaign label with the 
appropriate code number to the B-pillar of the vehicle. 

The Dealer number should be embossed in the center of the label and the code number 
punched out. This will make it easier for future service personnel to determine if the work 
has already been performed.

fnderthe National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, as amended, if there has been a recall 
campaign, centers must assure that all new vehicles and new items of replacement equipment are free of 
safety defects and comply with all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards at the time of delivery 
to the consumer. This means that centers may not deliver new motor vehicles or new items of replacement 
equipment to consumers unless the safety defect or noncompliance has been remedied before delivery.

Vehicle Technical Diagnosis (FTD) 

The purpose of the FTD is to inform center personnel about new systems, vehicles and 
productions changes. The FTD does not address any product quality concerns but might 
include information on operating parameters. The intention is informational only and can 
be found in ISTA. 

A benefit of an FTD is that it is usually written before the product is released so that per¬ 
sonnel can become familiar with the new systems or technology on its way. 

The layout of the Vehicle Technical Diagnosisis similar to an SIB. It includes: 

• Title Block 

• Introduction 

• System Functions 

• Operation

Introduction 

A digital compass in the interior mirror is available as special equipment (option 4NA) for the BMW 3- 
Series . 

A small LCD display on the top right of the interior mirror shows the direction of travel: e.g. SW for South 
West. 

In the USA in particular, the compass provides additional benefits. In large cities the streets are frequently 
arranged according to the points of the compass. The points of the compass are also marked on 
signposts. 

The compass also makes orientation in European cities easier.

Parts Bulletins 


The target audience of the Parts Bulletin System are Parts Managers and their 
employees, however the information can be useful as reference to a Technician. 

The Parts Bulletins contain information concerning: 

• Parts Ordering 

• Parts Updates 

• Vehicle Accessory Introductions 

• Policies 

• Warranty Information 

• Parts Recalls and Campaigns 

The layout is similar to that of the Service Information Bulletin. The Parts Bulletins are 
also arranged by the BMW Main Group numbering system. There are a few differences 
in groups 00 through 10, 80, 81 and 82. These groups are specific to issues 
concerning the Parts Department. 

Technical Data (TED) 

Technical data consists of specifications for systems and components. 

Obtaining proper technical data is usually aided by accessing the technical data via 
a hotbox under repair instructions. 

Tightening Torque (AZD) 

Tightening torques can be obtained from the repair instructions main menu page. 
Obtaining proper technical data is usually aided by accessing the technical data via 
a hotbox under repair instructions. 

Special Tools Catalog 

Special tools are identified in the repair manual where their use is appropriate or required, 
however they may also be found in the special tools catalog on the TIS main screen. 

As new tools are introduced they are published in Service Information Bulletins group 04. 
Later the tools can be found in the Special Tool Catalog in TIS or in the repair instructions.

Labor Times (KSD) 

The KSD program is used to determine labor times allowed for repairs. The most current 

version of the KSD and the applicable Service Information Bulletins (S.I.B.) are the only 

accepted sources of flat rate operations and times for warranty claims. 

Reason for Policy 

• To provide a unit of measure and a source for the determination of equitable repair 
times. 

• To provide flat rate operation numbers to identify specific repairs. 

Procedures 

1. The BMW Flat Rate System is based upon flat rate units. Each flat rate unit is the 
equivalent of 7.5 minutes. The labor times for all warranty claims must be recorded 
in flat rate units. Effective with repairs performed on and after January 1, 2002, 

BMW NA will pay all labor based on an 8 FRU hour, which is providing an additional 
25% increase in payment for published labor operations and work time/diagnostic 
time. Please refer to Service Information bulletin 01 03 01 for detailed information 
regarding this issue. 

2. The BMW Flat Rate System is divided into numerical sections (groups) which 
generally correspond to the main component groups of the vehicle as identified 
in the service bulletins and KSD software supplied by BMW NA. 

3. Main labor operations (as defined) are complete in themselves. All main labor 
operation numbers will end with 000 to 499 as the last three digits of the operation. 
A main operation includes all repair procedures to complete the task and an 
allowance for necessary ancillary tasks (e.g., visual inspection, lubrication with 
grease or oil, cleaning parts and assemblies). Refer to workshop manuals and 
service information bulletins for current and complete descriptions of work 
procedures. If you have two main labor operation numbers for a repair, overlapping 
labor times may exist and should be corrected before warranty claim submission. 

If doubt still exists after researching a labor operation number call the Warranty 
Department. The flat rate operations selected must be applicable to the model 
repaired. 

4. Associated labor operations are used in conjunction with a main labor operation 
number. Associated labor operations consider work that has already begun and 
thus removes overlapping time that otherwise would occur should multiple main 
labor operations be combined. Associated labor operation numbers range from 
500 to 999 for the last three digits of the operation number. Care should be used 

to select the correct associated labor operation based on the actual repair performed 
considering any overlapping labor times. In many of the repair groups there are 
multiple operations available for different repair combinations. Do not rely on 
memory; research the correct labor operation for the repair circumstances. If you 
are unsure after researching the labor operation, call the Warranty Department. 

10 

Information Resources 



5. A plus (+) operation or plus code is a type of associated labor operation that must be 
applied in conjunction with performing multiple main labor repairs. One main labor 
operation should be used and any other main work performed should be coded with 
plus code operations. This removes the overlapping administrative time that other¬ 
wise would occur when utilizing multiple main labor operations. If a main operation is 
used during the vehicle visit for any type of repair charged to BMW NA and a plus (+) 
operation is available for any additional repairs, the plus (+) operation must be used. 

6. The published time for all labor operation numbers cannot be changed during claim 
entry. The computer will pay the published flat rate value regardless of BMW center 
input. To claim less time because of recognized overlaps, use one of the special flat 
rate operation numbers for work time reimbursement (WPPM-5). 

7. After researching the labor operation, if you believe the appropriate labor operation 
is missing or the time allowance is insufficient, report the situation to the Warranty 
Department. Complete a Flat Rate Survey Sheet or use your BMW center letterhead 
to describe the details of the situation. Be sure to include all of the applicable infor¬ 
mation (e.g., VIN for missing labor operations, labor operation number for discrepan¬ 
cies). Then fax this information to the Warranty Department. 

Note: To ensure that only one main labor operation appears on any claim 

or group of claims from the same repair order, all open time/diagnostic 
time is to be considered as the main labor operation. All other 
operations on the same line or other lines of the repair order should 
be plus code operations if available (last three digits of the flat rate 
being 500 or higher). 

Defect Code Number 

Defect codes are necessary to specifically identify defects and provide quality control 
feedback. The KSD defect code catalog supplies this information in an easy to reference 
format that promotes accuracy and efficiency. 


Example: 17 11 01 48 00 

Main Group (cooling system) 

Sub Group (radiator)

Schematics 

The schematics divide the vehicle electrical system into individual circuits. Components 
which interact with that circuit are shown on the same schematic. 

In order to provide a standard for the way in which an ETM is written and read, there are 
general rules that apply. Components are drawn in such a way that their general layout 
and function are self-explanatory. They are arranged on the page so that the current path 
can be followed from positive (top) to negative (bottom). 


16 

Information Resources 


General Guidelines 

(ETM rules): The schematic below will be used as an example. 

1. Switches and relays are always shown in their rest position. 

2. A component drawn in a dotted line indicates that only part of the component 
is shown. 

3. A component drawn as a solid line indicates that all of that component is shown. 

4. The dotted line between: 

pins 3, 8, 9, 20, 21, and 22 of connector X253 
pins 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, and 10 of connector X257 
pins 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 of connector X747 
indicate all the pins belong to that connector. 

5. To obtain more information on a component or signal select any hotbox and press 
the documents button on the lower navigation bar of the diagnosis software.

Personal Notification System Messages 

The first window that comes up once selecting TIS => BMW is the Personal Notification 
System Messages pop-up. 

On this window, you will find information on the latest DCS messages (last 5 days), bul¬ 
letins (last 30 days), and service measures (last 30 days) that you have not yet accessed. 

Example: If you read the DCS messages on the Personal Notification System 

Messages window, the next time you log on, the message will no 
longer be displayed on this window. If a new messages are generated, 
those will be displayed.) 

The information in this window is refreshed every 1.5 hours less. This enables the 
technician to receive the most up to date information. 

To continue access to TIS, minimize the Personal Notification window. (A security alert 
might be displayed depending on browser security settings).

■ General Search 

Used for looking up bulletins by group 
number and vehicle designation. 

Entering information on all fields is not 
required and might even reduce the num¬ 
ber of search results. 

Entering a minimal information in the fields 
increases the number of search results. 


■ Symptom Search 

The Model, Series and Body may be 
entered,, then under “Observed 
Symptom”, Select a condition, Condition 
Type and Condition Component. 

It is however NOT Required to enter the Model, Series or Body. 

By entering only general information, such as selecting only a condition, a greater num¬ 
ber of responses are returned. 

■ Component Search 

This feature allows for the search of a bulletin, measure, or technical information bulletin 
based on components. 

■ Fault Code Search 

A bulletin search can also be performed by entering the fault code retrieved from a mod¬ 
ule during a fault interrogation. 

Searches of partial fault code number are possible. 

■ Campaign Search 

A bulletin can be searched for by entering the defect code. 

This can be helpful if the vehicle has a campaign label on the b-pillaror if the DCS mes¬ 
sage says to perform a defect code campaign instead of giving the bulletin number. 

■ Bulletin Search 

If the exact number of the bulletin searched for is known, enter the information for the 
fields displayed. 

Searches by partial SIB number are not possible.
