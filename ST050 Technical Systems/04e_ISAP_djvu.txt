Introduction 


The Integrated Service Access Point (ISAP) is a wireless communication device 
developed by EB (Elektrobit Corporation) and optimized for BMW ITools application. 
The Integrated Service Access Point is referred as “ISAP”. The ISAP operates at 
2.4GHz and 5GHz WLAN band freguencies. It is designed to operate in the 802.11 n 
WLAN mode. 

The main advantages of ISAP are: 

• Very high wireless performance compared to older standards (802.11 a,b,g) 

• Robust design with high reliability 

• Easy administration via Workshop System Management (WSM) 

• AC power feed 

• Diagnostics for wireless traffic 

• Supports remote firmware download

The Integrated Service Access Point supports the wireless linking of the: 


• Integrated Service Information Display 

• Integrated Communication Optical Module 

• Integrated Measurement Interface Box 

The use of the Integrated Service Access Point provides high bandwidth and therefore 
makes for fast data transfers using the latest WLAN technology with provision for future 
expansions. 

Registration and configuration is carried out using the Workshop System Management. 
Firmware updates are similarly managed using the Workshop System Management and 
are implemented automatically when necessary.
