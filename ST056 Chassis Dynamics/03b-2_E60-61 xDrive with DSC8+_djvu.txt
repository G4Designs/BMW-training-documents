xDrive with DSC8+ 


From 04/2005, the BMW 5 Series wagon and sedan (optional) will have all wheel drive 
capability utilizing the tried and tested all-wheel drive system xDrive of the X3 and X5. 

The innovative all-wheel xDrive is a system for controlling and regulating the "infinitely" 
variable drive torque distribution over the front and rear axle. The xDrive uses the system 
functions of the DSC to positively influence the vehicle handling by specifically distribut¬ 
ing the power in the event of understeer or oversteer. 

With the controlled multi-disc clutch in connection with the xDrive it is now possible to 
resolve the conflict between traction and vehicle handling. 

This is been achieved in that the xDrive does not predefine the torque distribution by a 
fixed transmission ratio as is the case with the previous systems. Instead, distribution of 
the drive torque is dependent on the clutch lockup torque of the controlled multi-disc 
clutch in the transfer case and on the transmitted torque at the front and rear axle. 

Driver Benefits 

In addition to the previous functions, a series of additional safety and comfort functions 
will now be available to the driver with the introduction of the DSC8+ in the E60/E61. 

The expanded DSC8+functions include: 

• Dry braking 

• Brake standby 

• Automatic soft-stop 

• Fading warning and assistance 

• Drive-off assistant 

• Hill descent control HDC 

Besides the outstanding chassis characteristics of the BMW 5 Series, the all wheel drive 
system offers traction advantages not only on snow and ice but also on unsurfaced 
roads. 


Note: Because many system components and functions and are shared 
between the xDrive and DSC8+system, they will be discussed 
together in this section.

xDrive 


The innovative xDrive four-wheel drive is a system that controls and regulates the distrib¬ 
ution of driving torque to the front and rear axles. The measured variables of DSC are 
used by xDrive but are also influenced by modified handling performance. 

The multi-disc clutch is the heart of the xDrive. By using the controlled multi-disc clutch, 
it is possible to resolve the conflict between traction and handling performance. 

This is achieved through the fact that torque distribution is not determined by a fixed gear 
ratio in the xDrive as was the case in the previous systems. Instead, the distribution of dri¬ 
ving torque is dependent on the locking torque of the controlled multi-disc clutch in the 
transfer case and on the transferable torque to the front and rear axles. 

DSC8+ 

The DSC8+system adds features to the DSC8 system already in use in the E60 sedan 
and combines features used in other DSC systems (E53/83). Due to the mechanical 
composition of the xDrive system, the programming for DSC regulation has also been 
changed.

ATC 300 Transfer Case 

The transfer case ATC 300 (Active Torque Control) is used on the E60/E61. 

In view of the restricted package space of the transmission tunnel in the BMW 5 Series, it 
was not possible to adopt the transfer case from the B M W X3 (ACT400) with the same 
torque rating. 

On the BMW 5 Series it was not possible to drive the forward powerflow diagonally as is 
the case on the X3 with a chain, but rather it is necessary to divert it L-shaped with the 
aid of spur gears (pinions), resulting in a modified design of the transfer case. 

The actuator drive and the actuation of the control lever were also modified. The clutch 
package remains unchanged. The forward connection is provided by a bolted on drive 
shaft. 

The flange of the ATC transfer case is the same for automatic and manual transmissions.

The ATC 300 is installed in the E61 and E60 all wheel drive models. The ATC 400 is 
installed in the E83 and the ATC 500 in the E53 MU. 

The ATC 300 differs from the other transfer cases because it is gear driven not chain 
driven. The basic functions and operations remain unchanged. 

The difference between the transfer cases are: 

• ATC 400 & 500 are chain driven vs. ATC 300 which is gear driven 

• ATC 300 & 400 uses a four bolt flange to connect to the front propeller shaft vs. 
ATC 500 which uses a splined connection 

• ATC 500 utilizes one more disc in the multi-disc clutch than the ATC 300 & 400 

• ATC 500 has 19mm greater length between the input shaft and the output shaft to 
the front axle than the ATC 400. (the ATC 300 uses gears not a chain)

Adjusting Levers 

The actuator drive unit operates such that the drive pinion rotates and engages via the 
gearing in the control cam. In turn, the control cam is rotated and the control lever 
pressed apart. 

The rotary motion is converted into an axial force by the ball ramps in the control lever. 
The axial force that compresses the disc package in the multi-disc clutch is proportional 
to the transmitted torque of the multi-disc clutch. 

The position of the control lever is infinitely variable and allows exact regulation of the 
control cam by the actuator drive unit. 



Servomotor with MotorPosition Sensor 

The actuator drive unit is a DC motor with worm drive. It also features a Hall sensor that 
serves the purpose of determining the position and the adjustment speed of the motor 
shaft. The position of the motor shaft determines the closing rate of the multi-disc clutch. 


There is also a temperature sensor installed in the motorthat signals the temperature to 
the transfer case control unit (VGSG). A temperature model is calculated in the VGSG for 
the purpose of protecting the motorfrom overload. Forthis purpose, the maximum clos¬ 
ing rate is reduced in various stages. 



If these measures are not sufficient to protect the motorfrom overload, the control is 
interrupted and the clutch completely opened so that only rear axle drive is now possible.

Coding Resistor 

Because of mechanical tolerances in production, the characteristic curve of the multi-disc 
clutch locking torque varies slightly. 

Once the actual locking torque has been measured on the clutch test bench, a resistor is 
attached to the servomotor; the resistor's value is a reference to the locking torque char¬ 
acteristic. 


Each time the engine is started, the transfer case control unit measures the resistance 
value once and the optimum program map for the transfer case fitted is selected.

DSC8+Control Unit 

The DSC8+control unit is installed in the engine compartment essentially consists of 
three components: 

• Add-on control unit 

• Valve block with integrated pressure sensors 

• Pump motor 

The newly developed changeover valves permit even more exact control in the low pres¬ 
sure range, resulting in the following advantages: 

• Reduction of control noise 

• Improvement in control quality and control comfort 

• Improvement in automatic brake intervention by the active/dynamic cruise control 
AC C/DC C 

• Improvement in the control accuracy of the HDC function 

• Realization of additional brake functions 

Wheel Speed Sensor 

Active wheel speed sensors with an integrated evaluator circuit are used together with 
the xDrive. 

The active wheel speed sensors require a power supply fortheir operation. The output 
signal is sent as a data protocol based on the pulse-width modulation method (PWM). 
The PWM signal is used forthe purpose of determining the road speed. The pulse width 
contains additional information relating to the direction of rotation, standstill detection, 
installation position detection, and air gap reserve to the sensor ring, (example : sends 
one pulse every 0.75 s when the wheel is stationary) 

The direction of rotation is determined by the internal signal offset of three correspond¬ 
ingly arranged Hall-effect elements in the sensor.

Principles of Operation 


Power Flow 

When the multi-disc clutch in the transfer case is disengaged, no driving torque is trans¬ 
mitted to the front axle. All of the driving torque is then distributed to the rear axle. This is 
because the input shaft (1) is splined providing a permanent connection to the rear axle 
propeller shaft output flange (2). The multi-disc clutch couples the rear axle propeller 
shaft output flange to the front propeller shaft output (3). 


The driving torque on the front axle is increased or decreased by regulating the locking 
pressure of the multi-disc clutch, providing a stepless coupling of the front axle to the 
drivetrain. This depends on driving situations and road conditions. When the multi-disc 
clutch is fully engaged, the front and rear axles turn at the same speed. 

Driving torque distribution (front/rear) is based on available traction at each axle. For 
example, when traction is identical on the front and rear axles and a driver accelerates 
from a stop in first gear at full throttle, the rear axle is capable of sustaining greater driving 
torque as the vehicle weight shifts from the front to the rear. 


Another example is when the front axle is on a high traction surface and the rear axle is on 
ice. In this case, virtually 100% of the available driving torque is transmitted to the front 
axle. Based on available traction, virtually no driving torque can be supported by the rear 
axle . Obviously, when more driving torque is transmitted to the front axle, driving torque 
on the rear axle is proportionally reduced due to lack of traction.

DSC/DSC8+Control Unit 

As in the earlier DSC control units, there are two microprocessors incorporated in the add 
on DSC8+control unit. The difference is that in the DSC8 and DSC8+both processors 
do not calculate the same algorithms but rather one processor is responsible for perform¬ 
ing control and monitoring calculations and checking the plausibility of the wheel speeds. 

There are also two semiconductor relays integrated in the DSC8+control unit, one forthe 
pumpmotorand the otherforthe solenoid valves. 

On exceeding a road speed of 6 km/h, an electronic self-test is started, during which the 
pump motor and all solenoid valves are briefly actuated. If the brake is operated at a dri¬ 
ving speed of 6 km/h, as may be the case with "two-foot drivers", the self-test will be per¬ 
formed at a speed of 15 km/h. 

The check of the wheel speed signals is already started at a speed of 2.75 km/h. 

In connection with the xDrive, the DSC8+control unit also undertakes the task of calcu¬ 
lating the lockup torque forthe multi-disc clutch in the transfer case. 

The lockup torque is always optimally set and controlled to suit the corresponding driving 
situation. 

The drive torque distribution overthe front and rear axles is based on the lockup torque. 
The lockup torque to be set is derived from the pilot control and from a higher-ranking 
traction and vehicle dynamics regulator corresponding to the driving situation. 

The DSC8+control unit sends the data, concerning the lockup torque, on the PT-CAN to 
the transfer case control unit VGSG. 

Conversely, the transfer case control unit signals the lockup torque actually set as well as 
the load on the transmission fluid, electric motor and multi-disc clutch. 

TransferCase (VGSG)Control Unit 

The transfer case control unit serves the purpose of regulating the lockup torque of the 
multi-disc clutch in the transfer case and therefore to distribute the drive forces between 
the front and rear axle corresponding to requirements. 

The transfer case control unit receives the necessary torque request from the DSC8+ 
control unit and adjusts the currently required clutch lockup torque accordingly. 

The function required forthis task is the transfercase control (TCC).The control and 
power electronics circuitry required forthe actuator drive is integrated in the transfercase 
control unit. 

The requirement to set the necessary clutch lockup torque is converted to a correspond¬ 
ing rotary movement of the actuator motor. After turning off the engine, a reference run is 
performed in orderto be able to assign a corresponding clutch lockup torque to a defined 
angle setting of the actuator motor, while also taking into account the effects of wear. 

During the course of the reference run, the clutch is fully closed and opened once. The 
power intake is measured at the respective angle setting of the actuator motor during the 


17 

E60/E61 xDrive with DSC8+ 



opening and closing operation so as to determine the beginning and end of the clutch 
closing procedure. The angle setting is determined by means of a Hall sensor integrated 
in the actuator motor. 

A clutch and oil wear model is additionally calculated in the transfer case control unit. 

Where necessary, this model limits the lockup torque in orderto reduce friction. 

In the event of DSC failure, an emergency strategy for driving the transfer case clutch is 
integrated as a fail-back level in the transfer case control unit in orderto maintain all¬ 
wheel drive also in this case. 

Transfer Case Control 

Control of the lockup torque of the multi-disc clutch in the transfer case facilitates infinite¬ 
ly variable coupling of the front axle to the drive train. 

As a result, the drive torque at the front axle can be increased or reduced corresponding 
to the driving situation and the condition of the road. When the torque at the front axle is 
increased, the drive torque at the rear axle is, of course, reduced by this torque. 

The advantages of variable distribution of the drive torque at the front and rear axles are: 

• Optimum utilization of the lateral cornering and wheel peripheral forces applied at 
the front and rear axles. 

• Brake interventions by the DSC are required considerably later, thus increasing over¬ 
all comfort. 

• Compared to a transfer case with fixed transmission ratio (open longitudinal differen¬ 
tial) and DSC, with xDrive the drive torque distribution is considerably improved in 
connection with greatly differing friction values at the front and rear axles. 

Even when DSC is turned off,TCC is still active to ensure maximum traction and vehicle 
dynamics. 

Permanent all-wheel drive is cancelled to a large extent or completely in only three control 
situations: 

• When negotiating extremely tight corners with little engine torque in orderto allow 
speed equalization between the front and rear axle (e.g. parking) 

• At speeds in excess of 180 km/h 

• In extreme understeer driving situations 

The control algorithm of the transfer case clutch control can be described in three main 
modules: 

• Tire tolerance logic 

• Pilot control 

• Traction control/vehicle dynamics control 


18 

E60/E61 xDrive with DSC8+ 



Tire Tolerance Logic 

The tire tolerance logic detects different tread circumferences on the front and rear axles. 
This occurs when: 

• M ixed tires are used 

• Space saving spare tire is installed 

• Tires are used that have been worn down to different levels 

Normally, tire circumference deviations result in drivetrain torque bias (unwanted variations).

The tire circumference can fluctuate up to 1% or more as a result of mixed tires or wear. 
The tire tolerance logic decides depending on the driver's command and driving situation 
whetherthe slip is to occur in the transfer case clutch or at the contact area between tire 
and road. 

If the slip is permitted in the transfer case clutch, the locking pressure set by the pre-con¬ 
trol is reduced in orderto keep the work loss low. In the driving dynamic control situation, 
the clutch is locked slightly more than normal, the four wheel drive is always guaranteed 
when required. 

For maximum xDrive performance, tires (and wheels) of the same diameter should be 
installed on the vehicle. 


19 

E60/E61 xDrive with DSC8+ 























Pilot Control 

The pilot control algorithm reflects the driver's choice and calculates the necessary lock 
up torque as a function of: 

• accelerator pedal value, 

• engine torque, 

• engine speed, 

• vehicle speed, 

• gear and 

• steering angle 

while taking into account the maximum load on the clutch, transfer case and axle drive. 

The clutch is operated with minimum slip during normal vehicle operation, making avail¬ 
able permanent all-wheel drive with a drive torque distribution of 40 % at the front axle 
and 60 % at the rear axle. 

Even in the case of greatly differing frictional values at the front and rear axle, e.g. when 
the rear axle is on a sheet of ice, the pilot control ensures extremely rapid system 
response as illustrated in the graphic below. 

In addition, as opposed to a transfer case with fixed gearratio (open longitudinal differen 
tial), with xDrive no brake intervention is required at the rear axle in this case as no slip 
can occur. 

In the open longitudinal differential system, the brake is applied on detecting slip at the 
rear axle. Consequently, 62% of the drive torque is applied at the two rear brake discs so 
that only 38% of the drive force is available at the front axle for the purpose of driving off 
the sheet of ice. This takes significantly less time (approx, one/tenth of a second).

Traction Control / Driving Dynamics Control 

Traction control monitors the slip conditions on the front and rear axles. The wheel 
speeds, yaw rate and transversal acceleration serve as the input signals. 

The function of traction control/driving dynamics control is to achieve optimum traction 
and to keep the vehicle stable. 

As seen in the following graphic, in the event of an oversteer tendency, the transfer case 
clutch is completely engaged and the maximum supportable driving torque on the front 
axle is transmitted. This helps to "puli' the front of the vehicle until stability is achieved. 



In the event of an understeertendency, the clutch can be fully disengaged if necessary. 
In this example, the front axle is separated from the drivetrain and the driving torque can 
only be transmitted to the rear axle. This helps to "push" the rear of the vehicle until sta¬ 
bility is achieved. 



22 

E60/E61 xDrive with DSC8+ 


Limp Home Operation 

In orderto maintain the four wheel drive function for as long as possible even in the event 
of important sensor signal failures orfailure of the DSC control unit, a limp home control is 
integrated in the transfer case control unit. This control operates in redundancy to the 
transfer case clutch control in the DSC control unit. The limp home control contains only 
two control functions, pre-control and traction-slip control. 

The wheel speed signals are very importantto traction/slip control. Engine signals, 
steering angle and yaw are used predominantly for pre-control. If individual sensor sig¬ 
nals fail, substitute values are calculated and the relevant functions operated with extend¬ 
ed control thresholds. 

This strategy is continued until useful four wheel drive control is no longer possible. In 
this event, the driver is alerted by the DSC/xDrive lamp coming on in the instrument clus¬ 
ter and also by an acoustic warning signal (gong). 

Faulted wheel speed signals on the rear axle are calculated by driving or engine speed 
(remember, the rear wheels are always driven). If the front wheel speed signals fail, the 
values of the rear axle are adopted. Wheel speeds also substitute fora faulty steering 
angle signal. 

Note: On a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission, when driving 

onto brake analyzers, move the selector lever to the "N" position . On a 
vehicle equipped with a manual transmission, do not press the accelera¬ 
tor pedal once on the brake analyzer. This keeps the transfercase clutch 
open and the vehicle cannot be pulled off the analyzer. 


23 

E60/E61 xDrive with DSC8+ 



Dynamic Stability Control 

DSC8+offers several new features from April 2005 production vehicles. They are: 

• ASC-X/ADB-X 

• Hill descent control HDC 

• Dry braking 

• Brake standby 

• Automatic soft stop 

• Fading assistance 

• Drive-off assistant 

• Trailer stabilization control 

ASC-X/ADB-X 

Unlike regular road vehicles, SAVs are also meant to demonstrate satisfactory handling 
characteristics and appropriate traction on unconventional roads. In orderto provide opti¬ 
mum propulsion with sufficient cornering stability on both normal roads and other road 
surfaces, Automatic Stability Control X (ASC-X) contains a detection function to distin¬ 
guish between them. 

When off-road terrain is detected, wheel slip threshold is increased to provide sufficient 
traction force with the increased levels of traction loss. 

ASC-X is supplemented by the Automatic Differential Brake (ADB-X) function, which 
applies the brakes to the wheels per axle, for side to side torque transfer. For example, 
when a wheel is spinning on one side (up to the slip setpoint), the brakes are applied to 
that wheel and the driving torque is transferred through the axle differential to the wheel 
with the highertraction. This provides superb capabilities when there are diagonal trac¬ 
tion losses (ie. left front/right rear). 

ADB-X remains active when DSC is deactivated. Furthermore, ADB-X can develop full 
capability because the engine power is not reduced, even during extreme four wheel 
drive operation. Only that wheel which has a low traction receives the brake application. 

The brake disc can overheat with excessive ADB-X intervention with DSC deactivated. In 
this situation, the operation is discontinued at a disc temperature of approx. 700 S C and is 
resumed when this temperature drops below approx. 400 9 C. This is a calculation per¬ 
formed by the DSC control unit based on brake application time, pressure, wheel speed, 
etc. 


24 

E60/E61 xDrive with DSC8+ 



Hill DecentControl (HDC) 

As on previous all wheel drive vehicles in the BMW line, the E61 all-wheel drive also fea¬ 
tures the hill descent control facility for safe vehicle operation on steep downhill inclines. 
The HDC stabilizes the vehicle and prevents the wheels locking. The DSC8+module 
controls the build-up of braking pressure at all four wheels so that the vehicle drives 
downhill at a speed of approx. 7.5 mph (12 km/h). 

The HDC function is activated in the central information display via the menu: 

Settings =>Vehicle settings =>HDC 

The HDC ON function can be activated by setting a tick in the menu and deactivated by 
removing the tick. 

Furthermore, the HDC ON/OFF function can be selected with one of the two free but¬ 
tons (asterisk, hash) in the steering wheel button menu.

Dry Braking 

The water spray produced in wet conditions coats the brake discs with a waterfilm, caus¬ 
ing delayed response of the brakes. In connection with previous systems it was therefore 
recommended to operate the brakes from time to time. 

The dry braking function is dependent on the position of the wiper switch and therefore 
on the signal of the rain/lights sensor. The brake discs are kept dry by lightly applying the 
brake pads cyclically as required, this achieving improved braking response in wet condi¬ 
tions. 

While doing so, the pressure in the brake system is increased by approx. 1 bar and the 
brake pads are applied for approx. 1.5 seconds. 

Dry braking takes place underfollowing conditions: 

• Driving speed >70 km/h 

• Continuous wipe operation in stage 1 or 2 

The repeat interval depends on the wiper stage: 

• Continuous wipe stage 1 - 200 s 

• Continuous wipe stage 2 - 120 s 

• Generally 90 s as from 09/2005 

This applies only when the driver himself does not apply the brake during this time. 

The driver notices no deceleration or noise.

Brake Standby 

Quick release of the accelerator pedal causes the brake pads to be applied againstthe 
brake disc thus reducing the stopping distance (by approx.. 30 cm/100 km/h) during 
emergency braking.The DSC module builds up slight brake pressure (approx. 2.5 bar) 
temporarily (approx. 0.5 seconds) in orderto eliminate the clearance between the brake 
pad and brake disc by applying the brake pads. 

The brake standby function is activated under following conditions: 

• Driving speed >70 km/h 

• M inimum time between brake application 8 s 

• The brake standby function is not activated in connection with sudden acceleration 
(sports driving style). 

The DM E/DDE control unit makes available the signal indicating quick release of the 
accelerator pedal via the PT-C AN. 

The sensitive driver may perceive a slightly harder brake pedal. No delay or noise is dis¬ 
cernible for the driver.

Automatic Soft Stop 

Due to the transition from sliding friction to static friction on the brake disc, a stopping jolt 
occurs when braking to a standstill where the occupants perceive an increased feeling of 
deceleration. 

When braking lightly (< 25 bar) at constant pressure to bring the vehicle to a halt, the soft 
stop function automatically reduces the braking pressure at the rear axle just before the 
vehicle comes to a stop.This consequently reduces the positive acceleration peak per¬ 
ceived by the occupants by approx. 50% while extending the action time. 

The speed and standstill status are recognized by way of the wheel speed sensors.

Fading Compensation 

High temperatures (>550°C) can occuratthe brake discs when driving downhill over 
long periods or as the result of extreme multiple braking operations ( >80 bar). These 
high temperatures cause a change in the coefficient of friction of the brake pads resulting 
in the braking effect diminishing (fading). 

Forthis purpose, the temperature of the brake disc is calculated by means of a tempera¬ 
ture model contained in the DSC8+software. The braking pressure applied by the driver 
is measured by the delivery pressure sensor and compared with the current vehicle 
deceleration (target/actual value). 

When the braking effect diminishes, the fading compensation provides assistance forthe 
driver in that pressure is additionally built up by the DSC module.

Drive-off Assistant 

When negotiating uphill gradients, the drive-off assistant holds the vehicle fora short time 
(approx. 1.5 s) after releasing the brake so that the vehicle drives off comfortably without 
the need to use the handbrake. The braking pressure required by the driverto hold the 
vehicle is maintained automatically in the system. 

When driving off, the braking pressure is not reduced before the torque is sufficient for 
the vehicle to drive off.The holding pressure in the brake system (10 to max. 70 bar) is 
dependent on the uphill gradient. 

Uphill gradients are detected by the DSC sensor with the aid of a longitudinal accelera¬ 
tion sensor. 

The function is active both when driving forwards (transmission in Drive) and when 
reversing (transmission in Reverse) on uphill gradients (up to 50 %).

Service Information 


Safety Notice! 


1 


On a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission, 
when driving onto brake analyzers, move the selector 
lever to the "N" position . On a vehicle equipped with a manual transmission, 
do not release the clutch pedal once on the brake analyzer. 


This keeps the transfer case clutch open and the vehicle cannot be pulled 
off the analyzer. 



Towing: Use only a flatbed carrier for all xDrive vehicles! 


Oil, Transfer Case, and Clutch Monitoring 
Oil 

All xDrive transfer cases use Shell Gearoil partnumber83 22 0 306 816. 

There is no scheduled service for the transfer case oil. Oil Monitoring is performed by the 
VTG control module to determine when a service (change) is due. The VTG calculates 
transfer case and clutch wear based on the amount of slip, engagement pressure 
(torque), speed and mileage. 

This calculation accounts for: 

• normal "dry" road driving (Integrator 1) 

• "adverse" road driving (Integrator 2) 

• "other" road extreme driving (Integrator 3) 

Depending on individual vehicle use - driving styles and driving conditions, the transfer 
case oil service interval will vary. 

When a service is due, this will be indicated by a Fault Code and additional details are 
available using the DISplus/GTl. Service functions provide directions on changing the 
transfer case oil and updating the VTG control module with the necessary reset and 
adaption procedure. This is extremely important for CBS. 

Transfer Case and Clutch 

The transfer case and clutch have separate monitoring characteristics. These values are 
stored as adaptive values in the VGSG control unit and must be transferred to a new con¬ 
trol unit if replaced. 

The value for both can be obtained using the diagnostic software under: 

Control Unit Functions =>VTG => Diagnosis requests =>Transmission 
Control Unit Functions =>VTG => Diagnosis requests => Clutch

E60/E61 xDrive with DSC8+ 




Diagnosis 

Diagnosis is available forfault repairs and service procedures using the DISplus/GT 1. 

The test plan forthe VGSG contains valuable information on: 

• Replacing control unit 

• Replacing transfer case 

• Transferring adaptation values 

- Automatic 

- Manual 

• Reading out adaptation values 

Programming (flashing) 

Both the transfer case control unit (VTG) and the DSC control unit are programmable and 
the new control unit(s) must be programmed when replaced. The wear values stored in 
the VTG control module (to be replaced) must be transferred to the replacement VTG. 

Warning Indicator Lamps 

The warning indicator lamps forthe xDrive / DSC are found in the instrument cluster as 
shown on the bottom of this page. 



The warning indicator lamps and acoustic signals (gong) are assigned to the xDrive / DSC 
system states of malfunction described on the next two pages.
