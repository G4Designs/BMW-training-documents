Air Suspension Systems (EHC) 

Purpose of the System 

Air Suspension systems were first introduced on the 1999 E39 Sportwagon. Since then 
the E53 (X5) and E65/E66 (7Series) models were available with this new system. EHC are 
available is two configurations, the Single Axle Air Suspension System and the Dual Axle 
Air Suspension System. The Dual Axle (EHC II) system is only available on E53 X5 models 
from the 2002 model year. 

EHC systems can be found on the following vehicles: 

E39 Sportwagon 528i, 525i and 540i from the 1999 Model Year (Single Axle) 

E53 X5 3.0i and 4.4i from the 2000 Model Year (Single Axle) 

E53 X5 4.6iS from 2002 (Single Axle) 

E53 X5 3.0i and 4.4i from 2002 (Dual Axle EHC II) 

E65/E66 from 2003 M odel Year (Single Axle) 

There are some functional changes with these systems. On EHC, the entire axle load is 
borne by the air suspension. The underlying control philosophy of EHC is "Control only 
when absolutely necessary". This means that brief changes in the ride height are not com¬ 
pensated (such as potholes). This avoids any unnecessary control operations. 

The advantages of air suspension are as follows: 

Control is independent of the vehicle engine 

Single-wheel control is possible 

Lateral locking is affected 

A distinction is made between load and drive states 
An inclined load is identified and corrected 
However, an inclination is not compensated 
Self diagnosis can be performed 
Diagnosis with DISplus orGT-1 is possible 

An automatic interruption of control takes place in case of cornering and wheel 
changes.

Single Axle EHC I System Components (E39/E53) 

The EHC system consists of the following components: 

EHC Control Module 

Air Springs (2) with Air Reservoirs 

Rear Axle Level Sensors 

Encapsulated Air Supply (LVA) 

Warning Indicator 

Control Module 

The Control Module is mounted in the module carrier box in the luggage compartment on 
the right side. It contains the processing electronics and final stages for operation of the 
EHC system. 

The control module receives the following inputs for its processing functions: 

KL 30 & 31 (Power/Ground) 

KL 15 

Left & Right Ride Height Sensors 
K Bus for; 

- Vehicle speed 

- Engine running 

- Door/tailgate - open/closed

Level Control Systems 




The control module incorporates two filters (slow/rapid) for processing the input signals 
from the ride height sensors. Depending on the operating mode, either the slow or rapid fil¬ 
ter is used to check the need for a regulating sequence. 


The slow filter is used during the normal operation mode to prevent normal suspension trav¬ 
el from causing the system to make adjustments. 


The rapid filter is used during the pre-run and tailgate (LID) modes to ensure that the sus¬ 
pension is adjusted quickly while the vehicle is being loaded orchecked priorto operation.

Air Springs 

The air spring is made from a flexible rubber material. It 
forms an air tight cavity which provides the calculated 
spring rate required for the sport wagon. 

As the spring compresses downward the bottom edge 
of the rubber material rolls along the vertical surface of 
the base mount cylinder. 

Air is added or removed from the air spring through its 
top port. The top port of each spring is connected to a 
reservoir and the air supply pipes. The reservoirs are 
required to hold additional airdue to the compact design 
of the springs. 



Rear Axle Level Sensors 



Hall effect sensors are mounted on the left 
and right sides of the rear suspension for 
ride height detection. They are pivoted by a 
coupling rod through the rear axle swing 
arms. 

The hall sensors produce a varying voltage 
input to the control module as the suspen¬ 
sion height changes. 

If the vehicle is equipped with Xenon head¬ 
lights the right side sensor contains an 
additional sensor for the automatic head¬ 
light level adjustment system. 



Warning Displays 


If the system is faulted and off-line or set in the transport mode, the following is displayed: 


Basic Cluster: 


A warning lamp indicator is illuminated used on the basic cluster. 


High Cluster: A message is posted in the high cluster matrix display.

Air Supply System (LVA) 

The air supply system is identified as the LVA in the diagnosis program and in the repair 
manual. It is mounted in the spare tire well compartment. The components are housed in 
a sound deadening carrier, through rubber bushings, to prevent operating noises from 
being transmitted through the vehicle's interior. 


With the exception of the compressor relay, individual replacement parts for the air supply 
system are not available. If diagnosis determines a defect in any of the other air system 
components, complete replacement is necessary 

The air supply system consists of the following components: 



Compressor assembly with; 

- Piston compressor 

- Electric motor 

- Air dryer (desiccator) 

- Pressure relief solenoid valve 

- Pressure maintenance valve 

- Check valves 

Compressor Relay (Replaceable) 

Solenoid Valve Block (2 - two way 
valves) 

Lines - including distributor 



18 

Level Control Systems 





Air Supply System (LVA) Operation 


The single stage piston compressor produces a maximum pressure of 13.5 Bar. The com¬ 
pressor is maintenance free - provided it is used in a dust free environment. This includes 
the compressor's intake air filter. 

The compressor is driven by a DC motorthat is controlled by the compressor relay through 
the control module. 

When the compressor is activated, the pressure builds up to a working pressure of 11.4 
Bar (+0.8/-1.5 Bar). This is controlled through the pressure maintenance valve. The air 
under pressure is fed through the dryer and check valve to the solenoid valve block forthe 
air springs. 

There is one solenoid valve in the valve block for each air strut. This allows the system to 
compensate for uneven loads in the vehicle and maintain the vehicles ride height at all 
times. 

Pressure is drained through the left or right solenoid valve (energized open) the pressure 
relief solenoid valve, restrictor, check valve and dryer back to the inlet side of the compres¬ 
sor pump.

EHC System Operation 

A fully functional EHC system is controlled by one of three different modes of operation. 
The operation mode is selected by the control module based on current conditions provid¬ 
ed by the monitored input signals. The main modes of operation are: 

• Pre-Run/Post-Run Mode 

• Normal Mode 

• Tailgate Mode 

Two special operating modes are also included in the control module programming. 

• New/replacement mode (pre ZC5 encoded). This mode provides basic operation. 

• Transport Mode - Transport mode is set at the factor/ and raises the vehicle 30mm to 
prevent vehicle damage during transportation. It must be deactivated with the DIS/ 
M oDiC prior to customer deliver/. 

Pre-Run / Post-Run Mode 

The Pre-Run mode is activated when the vehicle is parked and the control module is in the 
sleep mode. Opening a doororthe tailgate initiates a system wake up and the control mod¬ 
ule comes on-line. 

The control module performs a self-check of the control electronics and sensors. If no fault 
is found, the system will check the ride height and institute a rapid regulation if the height 
varies by more than 40mm.

Level Control Systems 






























Normal Mode Operation 


Once the rear lid is closed, KL 15 switched ON and the engine started, the system switch¬ 
es into the normal operation mode. In the normal mode, the control module will constantly 
monitor the input signals from the ride height sensors and will activate a correction if the 
ride height deviates by at least 10mm.

Special Operating Modes 

Assembly Line Mode (New control module) 

The assembly line mode refers to control module manufacturing. New control modules 
are stored in a deactivated state. The control programming is not active and must first 
be ZCS encoded. 

After installing a replacement control module, it must be coded using the DI5 or M oDiC. 
The instrument cluster fault display will remain illuminated until the control module is 
coded. 

Transport Mode 

The vehicle rolls off the factory assembly line with the EHC control module in the trans¬ 
port mode. The transport mode inflates the air springs to a higher position (approx. 
30mm higher) than the normal mode in order to avoid damage during transit. 

The system will not respond to any inputs that would alter the height of the vehicle. The 
fault indicator (base cluster) is illuminated or instrument cluster matrix display (high clus¬ 
ter) provides the message "Leveling System" to draw attention to the transport mode 
setting. 

The Service Functions section of the diagnosis program is used to activate/deactivate 
the transport mode. Once the transport mode is deactivated, check the vehicle Ride 
Height Offset making sure the vehicle rear axle height is to specification. 


Control Interrupts 

Cornering 

To prevent unnecessary suspension adjustments while driving through corners, a "control 
interrupt" is built into the system. Above 30MPH the control module monitors the left/right 
ride height sensors for a difference of 30mm. Exceeding this difference will put the system 
into a control interrupt and no adjustment will take place. The control interrupt last for a 
duration of 5 minutes. 

Vehicle Lifting 

The ride height control is interrupted when the vehicle is raised on a lift or with a jack. The 
system monitors the ride height sensor inputs and when the height limit of 90 mm is 
exceeded, the control is switched OFF until the vehicle is lowered again.

EHC Service Information 

Diagnosis/Coding 

The EHC control module is connected to the diagnostic link. The EHC control module 
activates the fault display in the instrument cluster to alert the operator of the off-line sta¬ 
tus of the system. The EHC control module stores up to three electrical/electronic 
faults. 

Diagnosis/troubleshooting of EHC is carried out using the fault symptom troubleshoot¬ 
ing program ofthe MoDiC orDIS. The EHC system has an extensive diagnosis program. 

Replacement control modules are shipped in the factory mode. The control modules 
must be ZCS encoded using the DIS or MoDiC to activate the operating parameters.

Additional information: 

Leaks in the screw joints between LVA, 
pneumatic lines or air spring strut can 
result in excessively long control times. 


Possible effects of a leakage: 

During a control process or the attempt to 
correct the car height for the purposes of 
height offset, the fault of control-time 
monitoring can be set. 

Observe fault memory. 



In this case, the compressor inside the LVA 
is deactivated so as to prevent overheating 
caused by excessive compressor running time. 
The LVA is able to respond only 
after an extended period of waiting.

DISplus/GT-1 Service Functions Program 

The Service Functions program of the DIS/MoDiC provides the Transport Mode activa¬ 
tion/deactivation and Ride Height Offset functions (see next page). 

Once the transport mode has been released, or if the system requires left to right side 
height adjustment, the ride height "OFFSET" must be carried out to ensure that the vehi¬ 
cles suspension has a base ride height level starting point. 

The "HEIGHT OFFSET" is adjusted using the DIS or MoDiC. The procedure is as follows: 


Place the vehicle on a level surface unloaded. 

Access the Height Offset program in the service function menu. 

M easure the base ride height from the lower edge of the wheel housing to the center of 
the wheel hub. 

Check measured height against the specifications listed 

Use the DIS/MoDiC to correct the ride height if the value differs from the listed specifi¬ 
cation.

Two Axle Air Suspension (E53 EHC II) 

Purpose of the System 

The two axle air suspension system (EHC2) offers advantages overthe single-axle air sus¬ 
pension with respect to ride comfort and off-road capability. 

Lowering the entire body makes it easier to enter, exit, load and unload the vehicle. 

The vehicle's off-road capability was improved by providing the possibility for increasing the 
ground clearance of the body. 

The drivercan now choose between three different ride levels which can be set with a rock¬ 
er switch, as required. Automatic ride-height control for payload compensation and 
automatic inclination compensation continue to be fitted. 

Deficits of the old system 

The automatic payload compensation facility for the single-axle air suspension did not per¬ 
mit driver control. The driver could not actively control the system to make it easier to enter 
and exit or load the vehicle. 

Ride level was compensated via the rear axle only. 

Advantages of the new system 

The new system allows the ride-height control system to be controlled actively by the dri¬ 
ver. 

The twin axle air suspension allows both axles to be lowered evenly and in parallel. 

As a result, it is easier for the occupants to enter, exit, load and unload the vehicle. 

On the E39, the load of the complete rearaxle was born forthe first time by air suspension 
in combination with the optional ride height control system. The system was controlled 
automatically under all operation conditions, and there was no possibility for driver inter¬ 
vention on the X5, the rearaxle previously had single axle air suspension only. The air sup¬ 
ply unit and the control unit were adopted from the E39. The air springs were adapted to 
the X5. 

There is a standard version and a sports version. 

The ride-height control system (EHC) was supplied as standard in combination with the 
M62 engine and is available as an optional extra in combination with the M54 engine. 

EHC2 is optional on both the M62 and M 54 versions of the X5 and not available on the 
4.6is X5.

System components 

The X5 Two Axle Air Suspension System (EHC2) utilizes the air supply unit from EHC 
mounted in the luggage compartment, with the following components added or modified:

Air Supply Unit 

As on vehicles with single axle air suspension, the air supply unit is located in the luggage 
compartment under the spare wheel. As with the single axle air suspension, the auxiliary 
tanks for the rear air spring bellows are located in the luggage compartment. 

The airsupply unit is configured similarly to the single axle airsupply umtforthe ride-height 
control system of the E39, which is currently in production. 

The functions are implemented by activating a compressor and various valves in the air 
supply unit and on the air accumulator valve unit. 

The maximum pressure of the air supply unit is 21 bar.

Air Supply Unit 

Pneumatic Drain Valve 

The Pneumatic Drain Valve is activated pneumatically by pressure from the control valve. 
This causes the drain valve to open allowing the pressure supply line to vent to atmosphere. 
This design allows for large air volumes to be discharged quickly and eliminates the need 
for a solenoid valve with high current consumption. 

The 21 bar pressure limiting valve is integrated in the drain valve. 

Electric Pressure Relief Valve 

The electrically activated pressure relief valve controls normal system pressure. The con¬ 
trol valve performs this function in conjunction with the drain valve. 

High Pressure Vent Valve 

The High Pressure Vent Valve serves as a comfort valve and is used to release system pres¬ 
sure after the accumulator has closed and the compressor is still running. When the high 
pressure vent valve has opened the compressor can be stopped quietly. 

Air Drier 

In the air drier, the air which is drawn in passes over a water absorptive filter material in the 
form of filter nodules which extract moisture from the air. As long as the air contains more 
moisture than the filter material, the individual nodules absorb and accumulate the mois¬ 
ture. When the airflows back, it is drier than the filter material, with the result that the air is 
re-humidified and the moisture is discharged into the open air. The maximum 
water storage capacity of the filter is 30 g.

The pressure accumulator decreases the load on the compressor and significantly reduces 
the time required for large changes in ride height. 

The EHC 2 control module monitors system pressure via a pressure sensor mounted on 
the accumulator. Normal system pressure is 15.7 +/- 0.7 bar. Minimum system pressure 
is 9 bar. 

The pressure accumulator's charge is sufficient to fill the four suspension struts once from 
the Access position to the normal position and compensate for vehicle load up to maximum 
gross weight.

The ride height sensor is an angle Hall sensor which is activated by a ring magnet. The ring 
magnet is polarized vertically from north to south. 

The magnetic field line of the ring magnets intersect a Hall cell. The Hall cell is arranged in 
such a way that only the horizontal components of the field lines are evaluated. This results 
in different field line strengths at different positions of the ring magnet. The Hall cell mea¬ 
sures the field strength of the magnetic flux and converts it into an analog signal with a volt¬ 
age level between 0.5 and 4.5 V.

Air Suspension Strut 
Rear 

M inor modifications were made to the rear axle air springs. The air springs and the dampers 
are configured separately at the rear axle. 

Front 


The air suspension replaces the steel suspension at the front axle, i.e. the spring bellows is 
attached to the damper. The front air suspension strut and the impact absorber form a 
complete unit.

Switch Assembly 



The dash mounted switch assembly supplies a momentary switched ground to the EHC2 
Control Unit requesting a ride height change in the up or down direction. Three LED’s pro¬ 
vide current ride level selected and target ride level if a request for change has been made. 
The LED for the current ride height will always be illuminated. The LED for the target ride 
level will flash until the new ride level is reached.
