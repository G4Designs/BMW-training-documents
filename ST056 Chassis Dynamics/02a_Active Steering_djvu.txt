Introduction 


At BMW, steering systems have become an increasingly complex topic. This training 
module is designed to review basic steering technology and to introduce the latest 
Active Steering technology. 

You will be able to familiarize yourself with the most important steering systems at B M W 
Group and also find out how they are put together and how they work. Afterwards, you 
will understand their construction and interaction, which will mean that you will be 
equipped with all the knowledge you need for successful troubleshooting of steering 
system faults. 



These theoretical and practical exercises will enable you to better understand Active 
Steering systems, which will aid in service and diagnostic concerns. 


A steering system must be able to convert a turning motion input by the driver at the 
steering wheel into a change of steering angle at the steered wheels on the vehicle. This 
is the essential requirement of a steering system irrespective of whether it is a simple, 
conventional steering system orthe latest modern BMW Group steering system. 

Steering systems must have the following characteristics: 

• The construction of the steering gearbox in each case must enable the vehicle to 
respond to the slightest steering adjustments. 

• When the steering wheel is released, the wheels must return to the center position 
(straight-ahead travel). 

• T he steering geometry must follow the Ackermann rule, i.e. when the left and right 
wheels are at full lock, the extension of the wheel axes must intersect the extension 
of the rear axle. 

• The steering system must compensate for uneven road surfaces while ensuring 
that the driver remains in control. 

• To achieve the best possible handling, the steering system must have a low steer¬ 
ing ratio (i.e. number of steering wheel turns from lock to lock).

Steering Fundamentals 


Steering Ratio 

In orderto better understand basic steering theory it is necessary to understand steering 
ratio. Steering ratio is the relationship between the number of turns of the steering 
wheel in comparison to the amount of steering angle change that occurs at the front 
wheels. 

For example, if the steering wheel is turned through 360 degrees of rotation and the 
front wheels turn through an arc of 20 degrees, the steering ratio is therefore 18:1. In 
other words, it takes 18 degrees of steering wheel rotation to achieve 1 degree of steer¬ 
ing movement at the front wheels. 



A "high" steering ratio (which is less direct) such as 18:1 dictates that a large amount of 
steering input is required to steerthe vehicle through turns. A ratio of 18:1 is good for 
high road speeds. This is due to the fact that there would be no excessive movement of 
the front wheels when making lane changes. Therefore, a numerically "high-ratio” is 
optimal for higher road speeds. 

In contrast, when driving a lower speeds such as parking, a "low-ratio” steering , such as 
10:1, would be better. Less input at the steering wheel would aid parking and be more 
comfortable forthe driver. Also, low speed maneuvers such as low speed corners or 
avoiding road debris would be greatly improved. A "low-ratio" is also referred to as a 
"more direct" steering ratio. 


5 

Active Steering 











Vehicles designed for racing, such as Formula 1 cars, use a "low-ratio" steering setup. 
These types of vehicles would not benefit from a higher steering ratio. Tight, high-speed 
turns require a "quick" response from the steering system. 



In orderto achieve the "best of both worlds", some BMW vehicles have been equipped 
with a "variable-ratio" rack and pinion steering system. This is a purely mechanical 
system which uses a rack and pinion unit that has teeth of different "pitch" throughout 
the length of the rack gear. 



The teeth on the outer ends of the rack gear are more tightly spaced and the teeth in the 
center of the rack gear are more loosely spaced. This gives the effect of a "high-ratio" 
(less direct) when driving on the highway. At low speeds when more turning angle is 
required, the teeth on the outer end of the rack allow fora "lower-ratio" (more direct) 
steering which is more responsive during the required maneuvers.

Active Steering 











Steering System Types 

As far as steering systems are concerned, they are two basic types of steering mecha¬ 
nisms used on BMW Group vehicles. These include the following: 

• Recirculating-ball steering - This is also known as "ball and nut" orthe more 
common term being "steering box". This arrangement has been in use on early 
models usually the 5 and 7 series. The last vehicles in production to use this type of 
steering arrangement was the E38 and E39. The 8-cylinder E39 (540i) utilized the 
steering box, while the 6-cylinder E39 (528i/530i etc.) use a "rack and pinion" 
steering design. 

• Rack and Pinion steering - The more common steering gear design is the rack and 
pinion which is more versatile and lighter in weight. This is used on all current 
BMW models. 

Recirculating-ball Steering 

A low friction endless row of balls transmits forces between the steering worm and steer¬ 
ing nut. The steering nut exerts a force on the steering shaft via gear teeth. A variable 
ratio is also possible with this steering gear. 

An extensive and wide-ranging development history lies behind the modern steering 
systems used nowadays incorporating power steering assistance. 



7 

Active Steering 



Rack-and-pinion Steering 

Rack-and-pinion steering essentially consists of a pinion and toothed rack. The steering 
ratio is determined by the ratio between the number of pinion revolutions (steering wheel 
turn) and the rack travel. The steering ratio varies with the rack travel and corresponding 
gearing of the rack. Steering corrections and operating forces are dealt with by this sys¬ 
tem.

Active Steering 



Active Steering 


As discussed previously, there is a need to enhance existing steering technology. 
Overall, the best way to increase agility, convenience and safety is by the use of Active 
Steering. The new Active Steering system was first introduced as an option on the E60 
and is currently available on the 5 and 6 Series (E6X) as well as the new 3 Series (E9X). 

Active Steering employs a combination of a conventional "Rack and Pinion" steering 
system with a planetary gear system. The planetary gear system is actuated via a 
3-phase DC motor which is controlled an electronic control module. 

The Active Steering system allows a steering ratio which is fully variable based on road 
speed and environmental conditions such as yaw and lateral acceleration etc. In con¬ 
trast to a variable ratio rack and pinion, which is purely mechanical, the AFS system is 
capable of manipulating the steering ratio from a more direct ratio (10:1) to a less direct 
ratio (20:1). 



Note: Since the introduction of Active Front Steering (AFS), the terminology 
has been changed to Active Steering (AS). The German term for Active 
Steering is "Activ Lenkung" (AL). Any of the above terms may be used 
in this training module.

Active Steering 




Advantages of Active Steering 

In addition to the power assisted torque provided by the power steering, the Active 
Steering System provides a variable steering ratio to assist the driver. During this process 
and depending on the vehicle speed, an electric motor drives a worm gear which is 
meshed to a member of a planetary gearbox. This gearbox is capable of effecting the 
steering ratio. This means that, depending on the driving situation, the steering system 
generates an additional (or reduced) steering angle for the front wheels by changing the 
steering ratio. 

The active steering system is networked with the DSC driving stability program and is 
capable of intervention, by correcting the steering angle, at the first sign of instability. 

This means that active steering reduces DSC interventions in the lower response range 
thus providing optimum control comfort. 

Increased Agility 

Due to the direct transmission ratio, the vehicle is perceived as having a greater agility and 
handling performance up into the medium driving speed range (approximately 62 mph or 
100 km/h). 

The driver also has far greater control accident avoidance , for example - this combined 
with considerably enhanced steering precision and reduced steering effort. Direct 
contact with the road via the steering wheel is maintained throughout. 

Increased Convenience 

Some BMW models require more than 3 full steering-wheel turns to achieve a full wheel 
lock from the far left overto far right. Active Steering reduces this at low speeds to less 
than 2 steering-wheel turns from lock to lock. 

The benefit is less steering effort required when turning in city traffic or maneuvering in 
narrow parking spaces. On twisting roads in mountainous regions, for example, the 
reduced steering angle also ensures that hands always remain in the optimum position 
on the steering wheel, which means that crossing of hands, or even arms in some cases, 
is no longer necessary. The multifunction buttons on the steering wheel orthe gearshift 
paddles forthe SMG always remain conveniently within reach in all road situations. 

Increased Active Driving Safety 

The situation at high speeds is somewhat different in that a more indirect transmission 
ratio when traveling at high speed has a dampening effect on sudden (or excessive) 
steering input. Any abrupt steering input is countered by the Active steering system and 
serves to stabilize any yaw reactions of the vehicle. 

Yaw motion occurs for example when changing lanes, when swerving or when a load 
change occurs during cornering. Active steering intervenes electronically at all speeds 
without the driver being aware of this. The electronic stability program - dynamic stability 
control (DSC) - therefore does not need to intervene as frequently or as powerfully.

Mechanical System Overview 

The Active Steering System is based on a conventional rack and pinion style steering 
design. The major difference between the active steering system and a conventional 
rack and pinion system is steering gear. 

The active steering system uses a conventional rack and pinion which has been modified 
by the addition of an actuating unit between the steering input pinion and the rack gear. 

The major mechanical components of active steering system include the following 
components:

System Components 


Power Steering Pump 

The power steering pump is a vane-type which uses an electrically regulated valve for 
adjusting the volumetric flow of the hydraulic fluid. Due to the fact that the active steer¬ 
ing system is capable of providing the required wheel angle at a faster rate that conven¬ 
tional steering, a high volume pump is needed. However, a conventional high volume 
pump would be impractical due to the external size requirements. Also, the pump would 
cause increased fuel consumption and emissions. 

As an alternative, the pump is designed as a compact unit with a variable flow rate which 
is controlled electronically by the active steering system. 



Electronically Controlled Orifice (ECO) 

In orderto allow electronic control ofthe power steering pump, an electronically 
controlled orifice (ECO) is installed in the power steering pump housing. 

The valve, which is only installed on vehicles equipped with AFS, provides additional 
flow from the power steering pump when needed. This usually occurs at low speeds 
when a more direct steering ratio is needed. 


20 

Active Steering 





This additional flow allows increased angular velocity of the front wheels when steering at 
low speeds during parking or low speed maneuvers. 

Depending on the model and production date, the ECO valve is controlled by the 
following modules: 

• The SGM on 5 and 6 series vehicles up to 9/2005 

• The Active Steering control module on 5 and 6 Series (from 9/2005) and 
3 series (E9X) 

When the ECO valve is supplied with maximum current, the valve is fully open and allows 
the power steering pump to deliver the maximum flow rate of 15 liters per minute 
(depending on engine speed). 

When the valve is not supplied with current, the valve is closed and restricts the power 
steering flow to approximately 7 liters per minute for power steering assistance.

Servotronic 

The Servotronic controls the degree of assistance provided by the hydraulic steering as a 
function of the vehicle's speed. The flow of hydraulic fluid is restricted to a greater or 
lesser extent depending on how the Servotronic valve is actuated. Restriction of the flow 
depends on the current actuating the Servotronic valve.

2. Servotronic Valve 



E60, E61, E63, E64 up to 09/2005 

The safety and gateway module (SGM) actuates the Servotronic valve. 

In a vehicle fitted with Active Steering, the AL control module determines the nominal 
current forthe Servotronic valve. In the event of the AL control module failing, the SGM 
assumes the default value of the nominal current. 

E90, E91 and E60 f E61, E63, E64from 09/2005 

The Servotronic valve is actuated directly by the AL control module. 

The signals and messages required forthe Servotronic are as follows: 

• Road speed from the DSC control module via the PT-CAN 

• Status of the engine from the DM E control module via the PT-CAN 

• Terminal status of the CAS control module via the K-CAN 

The Servotronic valve is actuated only when terminal 15 is ON and the engine is running. 

When the speed signal is present the default value of the nominal current is taken from 
the characteristic map. 


22 

Active Steering 





The current supply to the Servotronic valve is interrupted by the faults listed below. Under 
these circumstances, steering assistance is limited to a minimum: 

• Speed signal from the DSC control module incorrect or no speed signal 

• Terminal status from CAS control module via K-CAN incorrect or missing 

• Line fault to the Servotronic valve (exception: short-circuit to positive) 

In the event of a short-circuit to positive, the entire on-board network voltage is applied to 
the Servotronic valve. This means that the Servotronic valve is fully actuated. Under these 
circumstances steering assistance is increased to maximum. 

Power Steering Fluid Cooler 

Due to the increased fluid volume and flow rate of the active steering system, a cooler 
has been added to the system. The cooler, which has a 4 tube and fin design, provides 
additional cooling capacity overa conventional cooler design. The cooler is located at the 
front of the AC condenser. 



23 

Active Steering 


Steering Rack and Pinion Unit 

The steering gear of the Active Steering system contains many of the components used 
on a conventional steering gearwith some additions. The planetary gear set and actuator 
motor are located in series between the pinion gear and steering input shaft (6). 

The core components of the active steering system is the actuating unit which contains a 
planetary gear set which is actuated by a 3-phase DC motor.

The input from the steering column is no longer directly connected to the pinion gear of 
the rack and pinion unit. In the case of active steering, the steering input is now directed 
to a member of the planetary gear set, specifically one of the "sun gears". 

The pinion gear is now driven by an additional sun gear in the planetary gear set. The 
two "sun gears" are connected by a set of planet pinions which are used to drive the two 
"sun" gears.

Safety Lock 

An electro-magnetic (solenoid operated) safety lock is fitted to the actuator motor

malfunction forfail-safe operation. The ring gear, which is meshed to the worm drive, 
is also held in place when the actuator motor is locked.

The safety lock is a spring loaded solenoid which is controlled by the AS control module. 
The lock holds the actuator motor in place when no current is present. During normal 
operation, the solenoid is unlocked by an applied current. When the current drops below 
1.8 amps (approx. 3.16 V), the solenoid will spring to the locked position. 

When a system fault occurs, safety lock prevents the ring gearfrom rotating freely. This 
provides safe steering operation is the event of a system malfunction. 

Be aware that there are other safety backups forthe active steering such as the 3 -phase 
actuator motor etc. The safety lock is an additional (redundant) safety device. 

Note: Please be aware, at no time is the steering wheel mechanically discon¬ 
nected from the steering rack. There is always a mechanical connection 
present. During a system malfunction, the steering ratio may change 
and possibly the steering angle may be off-center. However, the driver 
always remains fully in control of the steering. 


28 

Active Steering 











Actuator Motor 


The actuator motor is a 3-phase, synchronous, DC electric motor. It is controlled by the 
active steering control module. The actuator motor drives the worm gear which is 
meshed to the "ring gear" of the planetary gear set in the actuating unit housing. The 
transmission ratio from the worm gear drive to the ring gear is 20.5:1. 

The actuator motor provides the means for the active steering control module to vary the 
steering ratio. The actuator motor does not provide the turning forces for the front 
wheels. The turning forces are still provided by driver input and the power steering 
system (i.e rack and pinion, power steering pump etc.)

Motor position sensor 




The power supply of the electric motor has 3 phases for system safety. The electric 
motor is only able to turn continuously if all 3 phases are supplied with current in 
synchronization with the relevant position of the motor. The powered coil of the stator 
drives the rotor of the electric motor, consisting of a permanent magnet. This procedure 
is dependent on the magnetic field built up. 


29 

Active Steering 











The rotor position is detected by the motor position sensor. The direction of rotation of 
the electric motor is determined by the sequence in which the 3 phases are supplied 
with current. 

The electric motor is unable to turn continuously in the presence of a constant voltage, 
e.g. due to defective components or short circuits (unlike an asynchronous motor). 

Inadvertent turning (self-controlling) of the electric motor is prevented in the event of a 
short circuit because the electric motor is unable to turn through more than 120° 

(i.e. 3 xl20° =360°). 

By shorting the 3 phases, the motor is actively braked from fast operation and used to 
shut down the system in the case of defects.

The motor position sensor is mounted on the actuator motor. The sensor is used to 
detect the position of the rotor shaft and it operates on the magnetoresistive principle. 

The motor-position sensor consists of a magnetoresistive element and a permanent 
magnet. The permanent magnet is on the end face of the rotor shaft of the actuator 
motor. The magnetoresistive element measures the magnetic field in the horizontal and

The motor-position sensor has a measuring range of 180°. The motor-position sensor 
supplies 2 voltage signals. A rotation through 360° is based on 2 signal periods. The two 
voltage signals are used to calculate the rotary position of the motor. The number of half 
turns is counted by the AL control module, which stores this number in its memory when 
the ignition is switched off.

Total Steering Angle Sensor 

On the active steering system, the steering angle sensor only detects the amount of the 
driver's "desired” steering input. The "actual" steering output is determined by the active 
steering system according to road speed or vehicle dynamics. 

Therefore, there is a second sensor which is used to detect the actual steering angle by 
monitoring the position of the pinion shaft. This sensor monitors the "cumulative" ortotal 
steering angle. 

The total steering angle sensor is mounted at the base of the rack and pinion unit. The 
sensor operates on the magnetoresistive principle and monitors a permanent magnet 
affixed to the end of the pinion gear. 

The total steering angle sensor (1) is calibrated at the factory and cannot be replaced as a 
separate service part at this time.

Magnetoresistive Element 

The cumulative steering angle sensor operates in accordance with the magnetoresistive 
principle. The magnetoresistive principle is based on the effect whereby the conductivity 
of a ferromagnetic layer (magnetoresistive element) is altered by the influence of an exter¬ 
nal magnetic field on the same plane as the layer. The change in resistance of the layer 
depends on the direction (a) and strength of the external magnetic field.

Steering Angle Sensor 

The steering angle message is forwarded to the active steering control module by the 
steering column switch cluster (SZL). There is a second processor in the SZL forthe 
redundant steering angle calculation. The second processor is only fitted if the vehicle is 
equipped with active steering. The second processor is used for plausibility monitoring 
of the signal. 

The steering angle sensor is located in the steering column switch cluster. The steering 
angle sensor is a potentiometer with two measuring elements offset by 90°. The 
measuring elements offset by 90° ensure redundancy of the measurement voltage. 

The redundant signals and possible electrical faults are monitored in the first processor. 
This processor is also responsible for converting the voltage into the steering wheel 
angle. Forthis conversion, a matching function must be included in the calculation, 
which serves to calibrate the straight-ahead position of the steering wheel to the steering 
wheel angle zero. 

SZL Assembly on E60,E63 and E64 to 9/05 



Since the sensor principle is only able to measure one revolution, the number of steering 
wheel revolutions must be counted elsewhere. The output values on the byteflight and 
the F-CAN are multi-turn values and contain the number of counted revolutions. 

In addition to the signal processing forthe DSC control module (F-CAN), the signals from 
the second processor are digitized independently in the SZL forthe active steering con¬ 
trol module. 

These single-turn values are sent to the active steering control module on a separate ser¬ 
ial bus. This second path is dedicated to signal evaluation only. It is crucial that the 
analog/digital conversion and serial processing take place independently of the first path.

Code disc 


Detecting Steering Angle 

The steering angle sensor is designed as a contactless, optical angle measuring system. 

The system consists of a code disc and an optical sensor. The code disc is connected 
via a drive element directly to the steering wheel. The code disc turns within the optical 
sensor when the steering wheel is moved. 

The steering column switch cluster must detect the steering angle and steering speed 
information as the basis for calculating various functions in the DSC. 

Further information such as the absolute steering angle orthe steering wheel rotation 
information is calculated. A steering angle of - 1807+180° is detected. 

An LED and fiber optics unit illuminate the code disc from above. Due to the pattern on 
the code disc, the light from above reaches the bottom only in certain areas where the 
light beams hit the line camera. This process is similarto scanning barcodes on pack- 
ages/goods purchased. 

The line camera converts the line signals into electrical signals and transfers them to the 
SZL.

steering wheel angle setting.The pattern on 
the code disc changes in steps of 2°. 



The pattern on the code disc changes as the 
disc continues to turn.The light passes through 
the code disc into other areas. 


Optical Sensor 



The light beams hit the line camera. The light pulses 
are converted to electrical pulses in the line sensor. 



The position of the light beams is displaced.The line 
camera detects the light beams in other areas and 
transfers the information to the SZL. 


Relative Steering Angle 

The relative steering angle indicates the angle position of the steering wheel. The infor¬ 
mation relating to the relative steering angle is always retained even when power to the 
control unit is disconnected. Renewed zero adjustment is necessary only afterthe steer¬ 
ing column switch cluster SZL has been replaced.

DSC Sensor 


The lateral acceleration sensor and yaw-rate sensors are combined in a single housing 
and designated the DSC sensor (sensor cluster). On the E6xvehicles up to 9/2005, 
there are two DSC sensors installed on the vehicle. DSC sensor 1 is used for DSC 
functions as well as Active Steering functions. DSC sensor2 is used forthe purpose of 
signal redundancy and plausibility checking. 


As forlocation DSC sensorl is located underthe passenger seat to the right ofthe 
transmission tunnel. DSC sensor 2 is underthe driver's seat to the left of the 
transmission tunnel. On the 5 and 6 series (E6x) until 9/2005, DSC sensor 2 is only

From 9/2005, DSC sensor 2 has been eliminated from the vehicle. Therefore vehicles 
with Active Steering only have 1 DSC sensor. Both sensors are connected to the 
F-CAN. 

On the E90, there is only one DSC sensorfrom the start of production. The sensor is 
located underthe driver's seat.

DSC sensor 


As far as design is concerned, the two DSC sensors are virtually identical. However, DSC 
sensor 2 has an extra terminating resistor. The two DSC sensors have different part 
numbers. In addition, each of the two DSC sensors has its own identification on the 
CAN bus (CAN message). This excludes the possibility of confusing the DSC sensors. 

The DSC sensors are a combination of lateral acceleration and rate-of-yaw sensors. The 
DSC sensor consists of: 

• Housing with connector 

• Damperto prevent mechanical over-stressing 

• Sensorelement: 

The sensorelement consists of 2 piezoelectric acceleration sensors. A spring-mounted 
weight is hung in the measuring cell of the acceleration sensor. 

SensorOperation 

Each of the two DSC sensors supplies a rate-of-yaw signal and an acceleration signal. 
Any accelerated motion accelerates the spring-mounted suspended mass. The force 
needed to achieve this is generated by mechanical tension in the piezoelectric material. 
This results in a shift in the electric charge. Electrodes are used to detect this shift, 
which is output as an electric signal for processing. 

The second DSC sensor implements redundancy in terms of registration of the signals 
for lateral acceleration and rate of yaw. The fact that 2 DSC sensors are used means that 
plausibility can be monitored. The two DSC sensors are triggered by the DSC control 
module (excited every 10 milliseconds). Each time they are triggered, the two DSC sen¬ 
sors send their signals to the F-CAN. 

The 2nd DSC sensor is discontinued from 09/2005.1 DSC sensor supplies redundant 
signals.

Active Steering Control Module

On the E90/E91, the AS control module is located in the left hand wheel well area. 

Module C onstruction 

The AS control module housing has a stud for connecting the shield forthe 3 phases 
(U, V, W) of the electric servomotor. There are also two internal processors in the mod¬ 
ule. The F-CAN connects the AS control module with the DSC module. 

Module Function 

The AS control module is integrated into the on-board network by the powertrain CAN 
and the chassis CAN (F-CAN). 

The function algorithms for calculating the nominal values forthe operation of the electric 
servomotor are stored in the AS control module. 

In addition to the actual system functions, the control module has the following functions: 

• Control ofthe power-steering pump 

• P re-drive-check 


41 

Active Steering 














The AS control module is initialized afterthe ignition is switched on (pre-drive-check). 
The electric servomotor is not actuated while initialization is in progress. The sensor sig¬ 
nals are checked and, if necessary, calibrated.

Safety Monitoring Functions 

If errors are detected eitherthe status changes directly to "Error" orrate-of-yaw control 
is deactivated. When system status is "Error", activation of the electric servomotor is 
disabled. The system status changes to "Drive" once initialization has completed 
successfully. 

• Sensor plausibility check 

• Actuator monitoring 

• Vehicle authentication (Checks with the Car Access System (CAS control module) to 
ensure that drive authorization has been verified). 

The AS control module uses the various input signals to compute the signals for actuat¬ 
ing the electric servomotor. 

Input signals are: 

• Wheel speeds (wheel-speed sensors via DSC) 

• Yaw rate and lateral acceleration (from the DSC sensor or sensors) 

• Steering wheel angle (from the steering angle sensor) 

• Total steering angle (from the total steering angle sensor) 

• Position of the electric servomotor (from the motor-position sensor) 

C hanges from 9/2005 

From 9/2005, the E6xvehicles utilize the AS control module design from the E90. The 
hardware in the control module has also been changed to allow the control of the ECO 
valve and the Servotronic solenoid as in the E90. The control module location remains 
the same.

Safety and Gateway Module (SGM) 

The SGM provides a "gateway" function 
which is similarto the ZGM as used on the 
early production E65. The SGM is used on 
E6X vehicles. In addition to ZGM functions, 
the SGM is responsible forthe SIM functions 
as well. 

In the SGM housing, there are 2 separate 
motherboards linked by CAN connection. 

The output stages for controlling the 
Servotronic valves and the ECO are integrated 
in the SGM. 

The SGM is located in the equipment carrier behind the glove compartment. The SGM 
receives the volumetric flow information for controlling the Servotronic valve and the ECO 
from the active steering control module. The signal from the SGM for controlling the 
Servotronic valve and the ECO is pulse-width modulated. 

The software for controlling the Servotronic valve and the ECO is installed in the SGM on 
vehicles with active steering. The active steering control module sends the information 
required for controlling the Servotronic valve and the ECO to the SGM .The information is 
sent via the PT-CAN. 

The software for controlling the Servotronic valve is installed in the SGM on vehicles with 
active steering. No ECO valve is installed in vehicles without active steering. 

Body and Gateway Module (KGM) 

The body-gateway module KGM will be installed in the E60, E61, E63 and E64 as from 
09/2005. The KGM replaces the former safety and gateway module (SGM). As far as the 
active steering system is concerned, the KGM provides gateway functions forthe bus 
systems involved. 

On vehicles that are NOT equipped with active steering, the KGM controls the valve for 
the Servotronic system. On vehicles equipped with active steering, the ECO valve is 
controlled by the active steering control module. 

It is connected via two 51-pin connectors to the system network and is installed in the 
control unit carrier behind the glove compartment. 

For more information on the KGM, referto the training module "E6x 9/05 M odel 
Updates”.

junction box. 

The J BE is located behind the glove box in the 
control unit carrier.

Active Steering Functions 


Functions of the active steering system include: 

• Steering assistance (function of Servotronic) 

• Variable steering-gearratio (function of Active Steering) 

• Yaw-rate control (for damping of dynamic yaw) 

The following new function has been added to the advanced development of the 
E90/E91: 

• Yaw moment compensation when braking on a road surface with unequal frictional 
surfaces. 

Steering Assistance 

Power steering assist is carried out by conventional hydraulic steering (rack-and-pinion 
construction). 

Active Steering and Servotronic are mutual functions which together work to improve 
steering effort during low speed maneuvers. 

The Servotronic controls the degree of assistance provided by the hydraulic steering as 
a function of the vehicle's speed. The flow of hydraulic fluid is restricted to a greater or 
lesser extent depending on how the Servotronic valve is actuated. Restriction of the flow 
depends on the current actuating the Servotronic valve. 

The Servotronic is controlled by the following control modules depending upon model 
and production date: 

• E60, E61, E63, E64 up to 09/2005 - The safety and gateway module (SGM) actu¬ 
ates the Servotronic valve. 

In a vehicle fitted with Active Steering, the AS control module determines the nomi¬ 
nal current for the Servotronic valve. In the event of the AL control module failing, 
the SGM assumes the default value of the nominal current. 

• E90, E91 and E60, E61, E63, E64 from 09/2005 - The Servotronic valve is actuat¬ 
ed directly by the AL control module. 

The signals and messages required for the Servotronic are as follows: 

• Road speed from the DSC control module via the PT-CAN 

• Status of the engine from the DM E control module via the PT-CAN 

• Terminal status of the CAS control module via the K-CAN 


47 

Active Steering 




The Servotronic valve is actuated only when terminal 15 is ON and the engine is running. 

When the speed signal is present the default value of the nominal current is taken from 
the characteristic map. 

The current supply to the Servotronic valve is interrupted by the faults listed below. Under 
these circumstances, steering assistance is limited to a minimum: 

• Speed signal from the DSC control module incorrect or no speed signal 

• Terminal status from CAS control module via K-CAN incorrect or missing 

• Line fault to the Servotronic valve (exception: short-circuit to positive) 

In the event of a short-circuit to positive, the entire on-board network voltage is applied to 
the Servotronic valve. This means that the Servotronic valve is fully actuated. Under these 
circumstances steering assistance is increased to maximum. 

In vehicles without Active Steering, Servotronic is controlled directly by the safety and 
gateway module (except E90/E91). Currently, on E90/E91, Servotronic is only available 
on vehicles equipped with Active Steering. 

Therefore, the steering assistance (Servotronic) and Active Steering systems work 
together and complement one another. However, functionally, the two systems are fully 
independent of each other. 


48 

Active Steering 



Variable Steering-gear Ratio 

The actuator motor and planetary gear set in the rack and pinion unit make it possible to 
vary the steering ratio to according to road speed. During low speed maneuvers, the 
steering ratio is more direct (i.e. 10:1). The direct ratio allows the driverto apply the least 
amount of driver input to achieve a larger amount of steering output. 

For example, when the vehicle is stationary, less than two turns of the steering wheel are 
required to turn the vehicle from lock to lock. Therefore parking and low speed turns 
require less hand-to-hand "shuffling" of the steering wheel. This results in improved low 
speed performance and increased safety. The driver is able to keep more continuous 
contact with the steering wheel. 

To achieve this, the actuator motor is driven in the same direction as the steering input. 
This "decreases" the ratio which has the effect of "over-driving" the steering input. 

This effect can be compared to walking on an escalator. Walking in the same direction as 
the escalator will multiply overall input (walking).

Active Steering 


















As road speed increases, the steering becomes less direct (high ratio e.g. 20:1). Sudden 
steering movements by the driver are "dampened”. This increases safety by preventing 
unwanted excessive "yaw" motion. The steering ratio is increased as road speed 
increased. 

In this case, the actuator motor is driven in the opposite direction as the steering input. 
This increases the ratio which has the effect of "dampening" or "under-driving" of the 
steering input. 

This effect can be compared to walking against the movement of an escalator. The 
walking movement is somewhat cancelled by walking in the opposite direction of 
escalator movement. 

This increased ratio in combination with the increased "torque effect" of Servotronic, has 
an improved effect on directional stability and road feel for the driver. 


50 

Active Steering 



Yaw-rate Control 


Before active steering systems became available, the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 
system was largely responsible for correction of oversteer and understeer situations. The 
DSC system detects excessive "yaw" and counters this action by applying the brakes at 
the necessary wheels as needed. 

With the introduction of Active Steering, the DSC is no longerthe primary system for 
intervention during these events. Now, the AS system can detect yaw moments as well. 
For example, during a potential oversteer situation, the active steering system has the 
capability to "counter-steer" before the driver perceives any excessive vehicle yaw. This 
provides a stabilizing effect before the DSC system needs to intervene. 

So, in this instance, the Active Steering system supports the DSC system. DSC will only 
intervene when the stabilizing effect of Active Steering is insufficient to counteract the 
tendency to yaw. 

Yaw-moment Compensation (E90/E91) 

On the E90/E91, Active Steering offers an additional function for driving stabilization. 

With conventional systems, the driver has to actively steerthe vehicle in a straight line if 
the brakes are applied on a road surface with non-uniform traction levels. 

In such situations, the Active Steering performs this active steering intervention, to 
provide a stabilizing effect for the vehicle. 

Compared to pure ABS control, Active Steering with yaw moment compensation 
provides shortens the braking distance. 



51 

Active Steering 


^usa-ptidi 


























The function is accomplished by allowing the DSC control module to calculate the yaw 
rate plus interpret information from the front steering angle sensor. The DSC control 
module transmits the information to the AS control module which establishes the 
yaw moment compensation correction angle needed for stabilization, counter steering. 



The braking distance is shortened because higher braking pressure differences at the 
rear axle are possible with yaw rate compensation via the steering. ABS on its own would 
set significantly lower pressure than is actually possible at wheels on a high coefficient of 
friction ("select low") and thus create a longer braking distance in this situation. 

The driving stabilization function of the Active Steering can be deactivated togetherwith 
DSC with the DTC button (when DSC is completely deactivated). Together with the 
hydraulic power steering, the variable steering-gearratio is always active. 


52 

Active Steering 






















System Operation 

Unlike DSC, which can be switched off by means of the DTC button, Active Steering 
cannot be completely deactivated. 

The functions of Yaw-rate control and yaw-moment compensation are deactivated when 
DSC is switched off. However, the variable steering-gear ratio always remains active. 

When DTC is active, the response thresholds for DSC are widened. Active Steering 
increasingly assumes the function of driving stabilization if the vehicle is oversteered. 

Preconditions for Activation 

Preconditions for activation for Active Steering are: 

• Terminal 15 ON 

• The engine must be running 

Steering-wheel position and the position of the steered wheels are synchronized as soon 
as the engine is running. 

This ensures that the positions of the steering wheel and the road wheels match if, for 
example, the steering wheel was moved while the vehicle was at a standstill with the igni¬ 
tion switched OFF. 

Note:The synchronization procedure can cause the steering wheel orthe 
vehicle's front wheels to move. 

M ovements of the steering wheel orthe vehicle's front wheels might be perceptible while 
synchronization is in progress. Synchronization also occurs while the vehicle is on the 
move, but the process is extremely slow and virtually imperceptible. 

Fail Safe 

A situation that would critically affect driving safety would be forthe active steering to ini¬ 
tiate steering movements on its own. 

The safe system status (fail-safe) is when the actuator motor of the actuating unit is with¬ 
out power. Irrespective of whether the safe status is initiated by loss of power or by 
specific system shutdown, the fail-safe system ensures: the actuating unit does not 
engage in the steering. The actuating unit is arrested by a lock that engages in the worm 
drive of the actuating unit. The lock is pre-tensioned by a spring and held against this 
pretension by the power supply. The actuator unit is inhibited by a break in the power 
supply. 

The arrested superimposed gear unit ensures that it is still possible for steering wheel 
movements input by the driverto be transferred along the steering column. The steering 
then responds in the same way as conventional steering. The purely mechanical 
transmission between the steering wheel and the front wheels is retained. 


53 

Active Steering 



The electric motor of the active steering actuating unit is connected to 3 phases. A short 
circuit to earth will therefore prevent the electric motorfrom completing a full turn, the 
maximum possible being only 120° (360°: 3). 

The Servotronic valve switches under no electrical load to the fast driving characteristic 
curve. The power steering assistance is reduced accordingly. The volumetric flow when 
the ECO is without power is 7 liters/minute. 

If the active steering control module does not send a valid message on the PT-CAN, the 
SGM will operate with a speed-dependent substitute characteristic curve after 100 ms. 
The substitute characteristic curve guarantees sufficient steering response for the 
passive active steering system. 

The driver is made aware of faults in the system in the form of an indicator lamp symbol 
as well as check control messages in the instrument cluster. 

The check control message reads: 

Active steering failure! Steer with care. 

The following or similar message will appear in the control display: 

Steering behavior altered! Possible to continue the journey. Steering 
wheel may be at an angle. Have the problem checked by the nearest 
BMW Service.

Workshop Hints 


Steering Angle Sensor Adjustment 

A steering angle sensor adjustment (offset) must be carried out if the steering column 
switch cluster (SZL) orthe steering gear and rack are replaced. 

The cumulative (total) steering angle sensor in the steering gear is calibrated to rack 
center by the steering gear manufacturer. 

Radio Reception Interference 

Radio interference may be caused by a broken connection between the shielding of the 
3 phases of the actuating unit to the housing of the active steering control modules.

For diagnostics purposes, the active steering can be controlled as a control module in its 
own right. The control module is an individual component. 

Coding only enters vehicle-specific configurations. 

Servotronic 

Servotronic is activated in diagnosis as an independent control module, the output stage 
for Servotronic is located in the SGM. Only the vehicle-specific configuration is entered 
by way of coding. 

AFS Initialization/Adjustment 

The technician must perform the initialization/adjustment procedure after performing the 
following work: 

• Any alignment adjustments or steering component replacement 

• Steering column work 

• After replacement or programming of the AFS control module 

• After replacement or programming of the SZL control module 

A steering-angle adjustment (offset) must be carried out if the SZL orthe steering rack 
is replaced. This must be carried out on the KDS (alignment equipment). 

T he total steering-angle sensor on the steering gear is calibrated to the middle of the 
rack at the steering-gear manufacturer. 

The AFS adjustments can be found in the service functions menu of the DISplus/GT-1.

Wheel Alignment 

If the vehicle requires a wheel alignment, the initialization procedure must be started 
before beginning the alignment. Using the DISplus/GT-1, complete the following steps: 

• Access the test module for "Startup adjustment/AFS. When prompted, answer 
"Yes" to the alignment question. 

• Center steering rack and check alignment marks on the steering gear 

• Install tool # 324150 (tool not needed for E9X vehicles) and lock steering wheel 

• Proceed with alignment 

• After completing the last steps of the alignment (front toe adj), remove 324150. 

• Proceed with the remaining portion of the test module. 

This will set the total steering angle to 0 degrees by locking the superimposing gear (ring 
gear). The AFS control module will de-energize the electromagnetic lock which will hold 
the AFS actuator motor which will in turn hold the superimposing gear stationary. If align¬ 
ment is attempted without performing this procedure, the steering will be off-center by a 
considerable amount. Special tool # 324150 is used to hold the steering wheel in the 
center position. Failure to use the special tool will result in an off-center steering wheel.
