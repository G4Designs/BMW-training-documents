System Components 

Bosch DSC8+Module 

The DSC8+module essentially consists of two components: 

• Add-on control unit 

• Valve block with integrated pressure sensor. 

On exceeding a speed of approximately 4 mph (6 km/h), an electronic self-test is started, 
involving brief activation of the pump motor and all solenoid valves. 

If the brake is operated at a driving speed of 4 mph (6 km/h) the self-test will be per¬ 
formed at approximately 9 mph (15 km/h). 

The check of the wheel speed signals is already started at approximately 1.5 mph 
(2.75 km/h). 

The analog-controlled valves provide even more exact control particularly in the low 
pressure range. 

Advantages: 

• Reduced control noise 

• Improved control quality and control convenience 

• Improved brake intervention through active/dynamic cruise control AC C/DC C.

Sensor System 


DSC Sensor 

The DSC sensor MM 3.8 registers following parameters: 

• lxTransverse acceleration 

• lx Yaw rate 

• lx Longitudinal acceleration (uphill gradient, 
downhill incline) 

The DSC sensor MM 3.22 is used on vehicles with active steering. 

This sensor redundantly measures the most important variables for the active steering. 

• 2xTransverse acceleration 

• 2xYaw rate 

• lx Longitudinal acceleration (uphill gradient, downhill incline) 

Initially, the plausibility of each measured value is checked in the sensor before this value 
is sent on the CAN. 

Yaw Rate 

The sensor element forthe yaw rate consists of a surface mounted micro-mechanical 
measuring element and a digital sensor evaluation circuit. The sensor is based on the 
CVG principle (Coriolis Vibratory Gyroscope). 

An electrostatic diaphragm drive generates the opposite phase oscillation of the seismic 
masses. One rotation about the x-axis of the vehicle, i.e. one rotation rate, generates a 
Coriolis force on the acceleration sensors that is measured capacitively. Synchronous 
demodulation of the Coriolis acceleration, utilizing the velocity of the seismic masses, 
generates a signal that is proportional to the rotation rate. 

Acceleration/Gradient 

The sensor element for acceleration also consists of a surface-mounted micromechanical 
element and a digital sensor evaluation circuit and is used for measuring the transverse 
and longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle. Likewise, its operating principle is based on 
capacitive measurement.

Wheel Speed Sensors 

Active wheel speed sensors with an integrated evaluator circuit are used in connection 
with the DSC8+. 

The active wheel speed sensors require a supply voltage for their operation and output a 
square-wave signal that is dependent on the wheel speed. 

The output signal is transmitted as a data protocol using the pulse width modulation 
method (PWM). The PWM signal is used to determine the speed while the pulse width 
contains additional information on the direction of rotation, standstill detection, location 
detection and air gap (clearance) reserve to sensor ring. 

Detection of the direction of rotation is made possible by the internal signal offset of 3 
correspondingly arranged Hall elements in the sensor 1C. 

When the wheel is stationary, the wheel speed sensor outputs a pulse every 0.75 sec¬ 
onds. It is therefore possible to check the operational readiness of the sensor even when 
the vehicle is stationary. 

Detection of the installation location indicates whether the change in the magnetic field 
strength is sufficient to ensure reliable operation.

Dry Braking 

In wet conditions, a film of water is formed on the brake discs, resulting in delayed 
response of the brakes. 

In connection with previous systems it was therefore recommended to operate the brake 
from time to time in wet conditions to wipe off the waterfilm. 

This dry braking function is dependent on the activity of the windscreen wiper. 

When the windscreen wiper is operating in continuous wipe mode, the wheel brakes are 
lightly applied againstthe brake disc cyclically every 90 seconds in orderto wipe off the 
waterfilm. 

Dry braking takes place underfollowing conditions: 

• Speed >70 km/h 

• In continuous wipe mode 

This applies only if the driver does not apply the brake himself during this period of time. 
A delay of operating noises are not perceivable forthe driver.

Brake Standby 

The brake pads are applied againstthe brake disc when the accelerator pedal is released 
quickly thus reducing the emergency braking stopping distance (by approx. 30 cm/100 
km/h).The DSC module builds up a low braking pressure (approx. 2.5 bar) within a short 
space of time (approx. 0.5 s) in orderto eliminate the clearance between the brake pad 
and brake disc by applying the brake pads. 

The brake standby function is activated under following conditions: 

• Speed >70 km/h 

• M inimum time between brake application 8 s 

• The brake standby function is not activated in response 
to performance-oriented driving. 

The signal indicating quick release of the accelerator pedal is made available by the 
DM E/DDE control unit via the PT-CAN. 

The sensitive driver may perceive a slightly harder brake pedal. A delay of operating nois¬ 
es are not perceivable for the driver.

Soft Stop 

When braking to a standstill, a so-called stopping jerks occurs where the occupants per¬ 
ceive increased deceleration as a result of the transition from sliding friction to adhesion 
friction on the brake disc. 

When braking lightly (< 25 bar) at constant pressure to standstill, the soft-stop function 
automatically reduces the braking pressure on the rear axle just before reaching standstill. 

Consequently, the deceleration peak perceived by the occupants is reduced by approx. 
50% and extended overtime. 

The function is inactive at medium to high deceleration or during ABS control in order not 
to extend the braking distance. 

The speed and standstill status are detected via the wheel speed sensors.

Fading Compensation 


High temperatures (>550 °C) can occuratthe brake discs when driving downhill for 
longer periods of time or as the result of multiple braking operations (>80 bar). These 
high temperatures result in a change in the coefficient of friction of the brake pads, caus¬ 
ing the braking effect to diminish (fading). 

The brake disc temperature is calculated based on a temperature model contained in the 
DSC8+software. The braking pressure applied bythe driver is measured bythe pressure 
sensor and compared with the current vehicle deceleration (setpoint/target value). 


If the braking effect diminishes, the driver is assisted by the fading compensation with 
additional pressure build-up ofthe DSC module. 



A warning lamp in the instrument cluster informs 
the driver of the overheated brake. 


The DSC control unit enters information in the fault code memory in response to activa¬ 
tion ofthe facing compensation function. 

Function triggered at temperatures above 500 °C 

• HFC (Hydraulic Fading Control) is active for longerthan 500 ms and the brake disc 
temperature is above 500 °C. 

Function triggered at temperatures above 700 °C (multiple braking) 

• HFC is active and the brake disc temperature is above 700 °C.The warning light in 
the instrument cluster is activated if the fading compensation function is triggered at 
brake disc temperatures above 700 °C. A check control message is additionally out¬ 
put on vehicles equipped with a display.

Start Assistant 

This function provides assistance when driving off on uphill gradients by temporarily 
maintaining brake pressure in the wheel brakes. 

Based on the gradient, the DSC calculates the holding pressure required in the wheel 
brakes in orderto hold the vehicle. 

When the brake pedal is released, the pressure at the wheel brakes is immediately 
reduced to the holding pressure calculated by the DSC. After a further 0.7 seconds, the 
DSC reduces the pressure in the wheel brakes in stages to 0 bar and the vehicle starts 
off slowly providing the accelerator pedal is not pressed. 

Reducing the pressure at the wheel brakes decreases the breakaway noise of the brakes. 
This function is not active when the parking brake is applied. 

The angle of inclination is measured by the longitudinal acceleration sensor in the DSC 
sensor and made available in the form of a telegram on the CAN. 

This function is also effective on a downhill incline with reverse gear engaged.

Electric Steering Column Lock (ELV) 

The ELV safety concept includes the monitoring of the vehicle status. The CAS will not 
permit the steering column to be locked if the speed signal from the DSC is not plausible 
orthere is no signal. The CAS deactivates terminal 15 when none of the wheel speed 
sensors send a valid signal while the vehicle is stationary. 

The DSC8+ informs the CAS of the vehicle status with regard to: 

• Standstill 

• Vehicle moving 

• Validity of speed signal 

The information is transmitted redundantly via the CAN and hard wiring between the 
control units. As from terminal position "R", the CAS supplies system voltage on the DFA 
CAS line to the DSC. 

When the DSC is operational, the voltage applied by the CAS is connected to ground in 
various frequencies. 

• 10 Hz vehicle stationary < 5 km/h 

• 50 Hz driving speed >5 km/h 

This function is a part of the safety concept of the electric steering column lock. 

The CAS does not permit locking of the ELV if it does not receive a valid speed signal. 

The DSC must detect at least 3 wheel speed sensors as valid forthe control unit to apply 
a frequency on the DFA CAS line.

Service Information 


Some jobs on the DSC sensor system require adjustments in the DSC module as well 
as the LWS and DSC sensors to ensure correct operation. 


IMPORTANT!!! 


All DSC systems withouta pre-charge pump require 
the low-viscosity DOT4 brake fluid. Observe regula¬ 
tions governing fluids and lubricants.
