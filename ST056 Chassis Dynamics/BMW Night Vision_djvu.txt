Introduction 


The BMW Night Vision system provides the driver with a black-and-white image of the 
driving environment ahead of the vehicle in the central information display (CID). 

BMW Night Vision is a 100% passive system without active infrared illumination. Objects 
situated ahead of the vehicle are shown in varying degrees of brightness depending on 
the temperature of these objects. This enables the driver to detect in good time heat- 
emitting objects such as people, animals, and other vehicles. 

This thermal image is recorded with a Far Infrared camera (FIR) via a special imaging 
sensor which detects the infrared radiation in a specific wavelength range. 


The BMW system is distinguished from infrared systems with active illumination by its 
resistance to dazzling, its long range, and its clearly structured image. 



Image taken from CID 


The system offers the following advantages: 

• Improved vision in conditions of dusk and darkness 

• No dazzling by the headlights of oncoming vehicles 

• Highlighting of unilluminated, heat-emitting objects such as pedestrians, cyclists 
vehicles and deer, etc. 

• Better overview of the driving situation thanks to the depiction of the route of the 
road beyond the headlight cone 

• Enlarged depiction thanks to the zoom function of objects in the far distance at high 
speeds 

• Illumination of bends/curves thanks to the bend/curve mode (pivoting of image 
detail) 

• Illumination of dark courtyard and garage entrances 


Note: The driving speed must be adapted to the relevant visibility conditions 
in each case. BMW Night Vision is designed as a supporting system, 
which, with a modified driving style, affords the driver an early, better 
overview of the road conditions ahead of the vehicle.

Night Vision Camera 

The thermal imaging camera consists of a heated 
optical element and a thermal imaging sensor. The 
thermal imaging sensor is made up of a multitude 
of sensor elements. 

Each display pixel is assigned one such sensor ele¬ 
ment. The sensor elements generate an electrical 
signal as a function of the impinging intensity of 
heat radiation. 

The higher the temperature, the brighter the corre¬ 
sponding pixel will be displayed. The heat radiation 
is converted into electrical signals on the basis of 
the principle of a change in resistance. 

The image can be replaced up to 60 times per second. In order to ensure an image 
of consistent quality, it is necessary for the camera to be calibrated roughly every 120 
seconds. This calibration can take up to approx. 0.5 seconds. For this reason, the image 
may be seen to freeze in the display. 

The Night Vision camera is mounted with a bracket directly behind the left ventilation 
grille on the bumper mounting bracket. 

The camera is equipped with a sensor which detects heat-emitting objects in the Far 
Infrared range (wavelengths from 8 (im to 15 ^m). 

The camera resolution is 320 x 240 pixels. The maximum angle of view is 36°. The 
calculations for the "Bend/curve mode" functions are made in the camera. The camera 
operates in an ambient-temperature range of -104°F to 185°F (40°C to +85°C). The 
camera and imaging sensor are thermally insulated to provide protection against heat 
influences from the camera surroundings. 

The washer jet is screwed to the camera bracket and is situated directly above the 
camera's front lens. It is directly connected to the headlight washer system and therefore 
operates in conjunction with the latter. 

A heater element is incorporated on the inside of the camera-housing cover to prevent 
the optical element from misting over or freezing up. The heater is activated when the 
rain/light sensor detects precipitation or at temperatures below 32°F (0°C).

Night Vision Control Unit 

The control unit is accommodated in the front 
device holder behind the glovebox. 

The control unit increases the image data from 
the camera from 320 x 240 pixels to 640 x 480 
pixels. Only one detail is shown in the control 
display. 640 x 240 pixels are displayed when the 
"Full screen" function is activated while 400 x 
240 pixels are displayed for the splitscreen function. The diagnosis, programming and 
coding data are transmitted to the camera via the control unit. 

The camera and the front-lens heater are powered via the control unit. In addition, the 
control unit converts the symmetrical image data from the camera into a CVBS signal 
and, depending on the equipment specification, makes this signal available to either the 
navigation system or the video module. 

The Night Vision control unit is accommodated in the front device holder behind the 
glovebox. 

The camera-housing cover features a 12-pin plug connection. 

Button in Light Switch Center 

The button for switching BMW Night Vision on and off is integrated in the light switch 
center.

Principles of Operation 


The BMW Night Vision camera is a thermal imaging camera, which converts thermal 
radiation into electronic signals and then into images visible to the human eye. 

The thermal image is converted first by the sensor into electrical signals and then with 
the aid of image-processing software into a visible image in the control display. 

The sensor elements alter the resistance in proportion to the temperature. The higher 
the temperature, the higher the electrical signal and the whiter the pixel will be shown. 

Thanks to increased dynamic sensitivity, the sensor can generate a new image up to 60 
times per second. This results in a softer and clearer image. 

Heat radiation is absorbed and dissipated by virtually every solid or liquid body. Heat 
radiation, however, is not visible to the human eye because it belongs in the long-wave 
infrared range. From a physical standpoint, this represents electromagnetic waves with 
a wavelength of 8 ^m to 15 (im. This long-wave infrared radiation is known as Far 
Infrared (FIR). 

The advantage of utilizing radiation in the Far Infrared range is the greater range com¬ 
pared with Near Infrared systems with a wavelength of 0.7 ^m to 1.4 ^m. These systems 
require illumination with just this wavelength. 

Essentially, FIR systems consist of an optical element, a thermal imaging camera, an 
control unit and a display.

ambient light and the driving lights are 
switched off; BMW Night Vision is ready for 
operation approx. 2 seconds after the button 
in the light switch center is pressed. A mes¬ 
sage is shown in the control display during 
this period of 2 seconds. 

• The rain/light sensor detects insufficient 
ambient light and the driving lights are 
switched on; BMW Night Vision is ready for 
operation immediately after the button is 
pressed. 

• In conditions of darkness (underground 
car park), the driving lights are switched off 
and the driving speed is less than 5 km/h; 
BMW Night Vision is ready for operation 
after the button in the light switch center is 
pressed.

Visibility 

Normal driving-light illumination is approximately 328 ft (150 m). 

The use of BMW Night Vision enables heat emitting objects to be detected 
up to a distance of approx. 984 ft (300 m). 

This specified distance is dependent on weather factors. 

For example, heavy fog or rain reduces visibility. 



Comparison of BMW Night Vision Visibility with Different Vehicle Headlights 



The driving speed must be adapted to the relevant visibility conditions 
in each case. BMW Night Vision is designed as a supporting system, 
which, with a modified driving style, affords the driver an early, better 
overview of the road conditions ahead of the vehicle.
