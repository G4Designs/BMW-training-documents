Introduction 


BMW installed for the first time an “engine sound system” in the E85 Z4 3.0si. The 
intake noise of the engine was enhanced by means of a resonator and pipe routing 
without active intervention at the passenger compartment. 

As the name Active Sound Design (ASD) suggests, the Active Sound Design is an 
active system. The engine sound is evaluated by means of a control unit. The engine 
sound is evaluated according to the programed sound specification and various parame¬ 
ters such as the accelerator pedal angle (driver's desired load), engine speed and torgue 
for example. It is then output via the vehicle's own audio system in the passenger com¬ 
partment. 

The ASD system complements the sound of the interior space of the passenger com¬ 
partment through electronically generated engine sounds. Due to the increasingly better 
vehicle noise absorption and increased vehicle performance, BMW is initially launching 
the system in some models. Additionally other noise generated applications are still pos¬ 
sible, such as sound generation in the vehicle exterior area for electric vehicles. 

Active Sound Design will be incorporated for the first time in late 2011 in the E89 
Z4 sDrive28i. This system will also be installed in the F10 M5. 

There are currently two different sound characteristic maps. If the engine dynamic 
setting of "Efficient" or "Comfort"is selected, the generated engine sound output is 
somewhat more low-key in order to satisfy the comfort priority. On the other hand, when 
the driver selects an engine dynamic setting of “Sport” or “Sport +”, the engine sound is 
slightly more powerful, highlighting the dynamic handling characteristics of the vehicle.

System Overview 


The engine sound from the Active Sound Design is output or its audio signals are super¬ 
imposed over the existing audio, regardless if the audio system is ON or OFF, such as: 
RADIO, CD, MP3, navigation or telephone. 

Depending on the driving style, driving dynamics or engine dynamic program selection 
from Comfort to Sport, the tone and the level of engine sound output can be designed 
to match the selected program. 

The Active Sound Design control unit (ASD) in the F10 M5 is connected to the K-CAN2 
whereas in the E89 is connected to the K-CAN data bus. This connection enables the 
evaluation parameters and transfers the audio signals to the corresponding control unit, 
the AMPH (HiFi amplifier) or the AMPT (Top HiFi amplifier). 

The Active Sound Design control unit is located in the luggage compartment on the left.

Active Sound Design Variants 


HiFi System (AMPH) 

In the HiFi system the Active Sound Design is installed between the Headunit/CIC and 
the audio amplifier AMPH. The Active Sound Design in the FI 0 M5 is woken up by the 
K-CAN2. The ASD System mixes the audio signals coming from the headunit and the 
corresponding vehicle-specific and engine-specific audio signal. The ASD then forwards 
the modified signals to the audio amplifier and from there the combined audio signals 
are output on the speaker.

immediately available.

Design wiring diagrams.

Top HiFi System (AMPT) 

The Active Sound Design can also be installed in the Top HiFi system. The Active Sound 
Design in the F10 M5 is woken up by the K-CAN2 and generates the vehicle-specific 
and engine-specific audio signals. The ASD continuously forwards the generated signals 
to the respective audio amplifier (AMPT). 

The main difference between the Top HiFi system and the HiFi system relies in that the 
former, the audio signals from the Headunit/CIC and the signals from the ASD are com¬ 
bined in the audio amplifier and output to the speakers, as opposed to the HiFi System 
where the audio inputs are combined in the ASD control unit and then the modified 
signals are sent to the AMPH.

course of repairs, components for various software versions and hardware numbers may 
be installed: 

• The control unit for Active Sound Design (ASD) can be replaced individually. 

• The control unit for Active Sound Design (ASD) must always be encoded 
after replacement. 

• When replacing individual components, proceed according to repair instructions. 

• Only Original BMW replacement parts guarantee the function of the Active 
Sound Design (ASD). 

Diagnosis 

The Active Sound Design (ASD) can be read for diagnosis and is connected to the K- 
CAN2 on the FI 0 M5 and to the K-CAN on the E89. We can assume no liability for
