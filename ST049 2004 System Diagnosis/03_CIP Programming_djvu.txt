CIP Programming 


Model: All 

Production: All 



After completion of this module you will be able to: 

• Retrofit an eject box and perform CIP 

• Program a vehicle with complete vehicle coding 

• Change the vehicle VO

Choose which vehicle you will be programming. 


4 

CIP Programming 
























Select depending upon programming required. 

To retrofit select Load SW. 

To update a vehicle select Vehicle. 

Selecting Vehicle will ensure that complete encoding is performed.

Have control modules been replaced on this car? 



Note: For retrofits press No 



A YES selection will lead you to choose which control module(s) have been replaced. 
A NO selection will lead you to Retrofits.

After determining the fitted modules, a measures plan will be made. At this point you will 
be notified if control modules need to be replaced. 

Control module replacement is required if the hardware level in a module can not be 
upgraded to a high enough software level. 

In the case above no modules need replacement, in fact on the DSC needs to be repro¬ 
grammed.

If you selected no earlier (Have any control modules been replaced?) you would come to 
this screen. 

Here selections to reprogram individual modules can be made or entry into retrofit pro¬ 
gramming.

Selecting retrofit on the previous screen brings you here. 

More selections (such as mobile phone USA) are on the next page, accessed by pressing 
retrofits on bottom of selection list.

By selecting Vehicle initially when entering CIR you will save time when updating the 
vehicle. 

Updating through Load SW differs from Measures Plan determined through Vehicle. 

When updating through Load SW only the module programmed is re-coded. You still 
need to come to this screen and perform Complete Encoding. 

By updating through Vehicle, the entire car is automatically encoded, after the program¬ 
ming is complete.

CIP Programming 









































A measures plan has been created and accepted. It takes 1 minutes to 
execute this measures plan. 


The measures plan is now carried out with Start, the process is cancelled 

with Cancel. 


If cancelled, the entire process must be repeated! 



Press start to begin the programming and encoding procedure.

Workshop Exercise - CIP 


The purpose of this exercise is to retrofit an eject box to the vehicle and then remove 
the eject box by changing the VO back to its original state. 

The eject box does not have to be physically installed to perform the retrofit... 
However it is recommended that the eject box be installed so that testing may be 
done after the retrofit procedure. 

Note: The eject box is already physically installed in the vehicle, and the vehi¬ 
cle has been brought up to the most current programming level. 

Enter CIP 

When prompted, Select NO... Control Modules have not been installed. 

Select Retrofits from bottom right of screen. 

Select Retrofits from bottom of selection list. 

Select Mobile Phone USA. 

A measure plan will be determined, then select Accept. 

Select finish. 

At this time what modules in the vehicle have been programmed and encoded? 

Make a phone call with the mobile phone using the controller. 

Did the phone call work? _ 

Now disconnect from the vehicle, and cycle the key. 

Attempt to use the mobile phone now. 


19 

CIP Programming 




Retrofit the mobile phone again. 

Encode the entire vehicle. 

Disconnect from the vehicle and make a phone call using the mobile phone. 

Why did the phone call work this time? _ 

Hook back up to the vehicle. 

Select Vehicle 
Select VO 
Select Adapt VO 

You will be instructed to insert the disc into the DISplus. 

When the adaptation is finished the current VO will be displayed. 

The mobile phone VO code (K639) should no longer be listed on the VO.
