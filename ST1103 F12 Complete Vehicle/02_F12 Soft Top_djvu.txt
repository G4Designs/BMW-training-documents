FI 2 Soft Top 
1. Introduction 


The FI 2 is the new BMW 6 Series Convertible. It uses a fully automatic, electro-hydraulic soft top and 
was introduced to the US market (just in time for Spring) in May of 2011. 

As with the E64, the soft top of the FI 2 extends in the rear area into two side fins. This design enables 
the top edge of the soft top to be flattened towards the rear, which gives the car a coupe-like silhouette 
with a highly recognizable as a 6 Series when the soft top is closed. 



BMW 6 Series Convertible 


The soft top of the FI 2 is essentially based on that of the E64. 

• The soft top is foam-backed with polyurethane, this provides excellent insulation against wind 
and driving noises. 

• The heated, retractable rear window can be operated separately from the soft top. 

• The soft top can be automatically operated with the soft top switch or with the integrated key 
in the lock cylinder of the driver's door. 

The FI 2 soft top to be opened and closed with the ID transmitter, and closed via the outside 
door handle electronics. This is made possible because all FI 2 vehicles are equipped with 
comfort access as standard equipment. 

• It takes approximately 19 seconds for the soft top to open and approximately 22 seconds for 

it to close. With the side and rear windows being lowered or raised and the car being unlocked 
or locked while the soft top is being operated, it takes approximately 25 seconds for opening 
and approximately 26 seconds for closing. 

Unlike the E64 convertible top, which was made by Edcha, the FI 2 soft top is manufactured instead by 
the Karmann company. 

Special features 

• The soft top can be ordered in two colors: black or beige. The headliner is always black. 

• The soft top can be opened and closed while the car is being driven up to a speed of approxi¬ 
mately 40 km/h / 25 mph. 

The soft top, once it has started moving, will be stopped at a speed exceeding approximately 
50 km/h / 31 mph.

The soft top frame is connected at the two main bearings to the bodyshell. To open and close the soft 
top, the main pillars and the fins are driven via a linkage by hydraulic cylinders. The soft top is locked 
on the cowl panel by the front soft top bow.

To lock and unlock the front soft top bow with the windshield frame, the retaining hooks are moved by 
an electric motor via the pushrods and the gearing. 

A Hall-effect sensor on the carrier plate senses the locked position of the retaining hooks, all further 
positions are determined by means of an incremental sensor located in the electric motor. 

The locking noises and the locking speed have been improved in the FI 2 when compared with the 
E64. 

2.2.3. Soft top compartment lid 

The FI 2 soft top compartment lid is made of SMC (Sheet Moulding Compound), a fiber-plastic com¬ 
posite. 



FI 2 Soft top compartment lid 


The FI 2 soft top compartment lid has been visibly enhanced with the addition of trim strips and a re¬ 
designed rear window assembly trim. The overall seal has also been improved by an optimized hinge 
connection design. 


The enhanced rigidity of the SMC soft top compartment lid has made it possible to provide a more ac¬ 
curate fit between the soft top compartment lid and the body of the vehicle.

The two locks of the soft top compartment lid are actuated by the kinematic box via a cable. 


2.2.4. Variable soft top compartment 

As with the E64, the luggage compartment capacity of the FI 2 can also be increased when the soft 
top is closed. 

Moving the hinged panel of the variable soft top compartment into the upper position increases the 
luggage compartment capacity from 300 to 350 liters. Unlike the E64, the FI 2 uses a leaf spring de¬ 
sign. 

It is important to note that before the soft top can be opened, the hinged panel must be returned to the 
lower position. 

The lower position of the hinged panel is monitored by a microswitch on the right side of the frame and 
forwarded to the soft top module.

Six hydraulic cylinders (arranged in pairs) operate the soft top compartment lid, the fins and the main 
pillars. The hydraulic cylinders can be pressurized at the plunger and rod ends. 

The direction in which the hydraulic cylinders for the main pillars are actuated is dependent on the di¬ 
rection in which the hydraulic pump rotates. The directions in which the hydraulic cylinders for the soft 
top compartment lid and the fins are actuated are dependent on the setting of the relevant changeover 
valves. When a hydraulic cylinder is pressurized at both ends, the pressure at the plunger end is domi¬ 
nant and the plunger rod extends. 

In contrast to the E64, to save space, the entire hydraulic unit of the FI 2 is located inside the rear win¬ 
dow module. The hydraulic fluid does not have to be changed. Service openings are provided in the 
rear window module and in the hydraulic unit for topping up hydraulic fluid, lost for example due to a 
leak. These openings are each sealed by a round cap. Hydraulic fluid may only be added up to the level 
mark on the fluid reservoir as seen below. 



F12 Hydraulic fluid reservoir, service openings 


The hydraulic system is automatically bled in the fluid reservoir. 

If after a repair or emergency operation, there is high level noise while the soft top is being operated 
the soft top must be opened and closed several times in succession so that the air can be bled from 
the system. 


11 







FI 2 Soft Top 
2. System Components 

The temperature of the hydraulic pump is determined by the soft top module by means of a virtual 
sensor. The hydraulic pump can run without interruption for roughly 8 minutes. The soft top can be op¬ 
erated again after the hydraulic system has cooled down. 

The hydraulic pump's operating pressure is 190 to 200 bar. The system pressure is limited by two 
pressure-limiting valves to 190 bar. 

The entire hydraulic system is depressurized if the soft top has been completely opened or closed. 

If soft top operation is interrupted, the soft top compartment lid closes automatically after 8 to 10 min¬ 
utes (when operated with the ID transmitter after approximately 30 seconds). Changeover valve 1 is al¬ 
ternately supplied with current (clocking).

Unlike in the E64, the rear side windows in the FI 2 are also fitted with an anti-trap mechanism. The 
rear window still does not have an anti-trap mechanism. 

The four side windows and the rear window can be opened with the toll function. Only the four side 
windows can be closed with the toll function. The switch must be continuously operated in order to 
close the rear window.

Soft top switch 


The soft top switch is located in the center console behind the selector lever/gearshift lever. The oper¬ 
ating principle is similar to that for the power window regulators. 

One green LED and one red LED are integrated in the soft top switch. The green LED is lit while the 
soft top is moving. When the red LED lights up, the soft top switch has been operated and one or more 
prerequisites for soft top operation have not been fulfilled (e.g. hinged panel of the variable soft top 
compartment not in the lower position). If the soft top switch is released while the soft top is being 
opened or closed, the movements are stopped and the red LED in the soft top switch lights up. 

The soft top module (current version CVM 7) controls and monitors all the electrical functions of the 
electro-hydraulic soft top. The functions are similar to those of the electro-hydraulic soft top in the 
E64.

The sensors sense the component positions relevant to soft top operation and signal these positions 
to the soft top module. 

The angle-of-rotation sensors sense the positions of the main pillars and the fins. They are designed 
as potentiometers. The output voltage of each potentiometer changes while the soft top is being oper¬ 
ated. The voltage values are converted by the soft top module into angle values. 

The Hall-effect sensors sense specific positions of the fins, rear window, retaining hooks and soft top 
compartment lid. 

The soft top compartment microswitch uses a mechanical contact to sense the lower position of the 
hinged panel of the variable soft top compartment.

3. Operation and Function 

3.1. Soft top operation 

A 

For safety reasons, always observe the opening and closing actions of the soft top and make sure that 
nobody is trapped or injured by the mechanism. 


3.1.1. Prerequisites 

The following conditions must be satisfied before the soft top can be opened or closed: 

• Hinged panel of the variable soft top compartment in the lower position 

• Luggage compartment lid is closed 

• Driving speed < 40 km/h / 25 mph 

• Ambient temperature >-20 °C 

• Terminal 15N activated (only for standard operation with the soft top switch) 

• Power window regulators are initialized 

• Battery voltage > 10.5 V 

• Temperature of hydraulic pump not too high 

(The temperature of the hydraulic pump is recorded by the soft top module by means of a vir¬ 
tual sensor. The hydraulic pump can run without interruption for roughly 8 minutes. The soft 
top can be operated again after the hydraulic system has cooled down) 

• Car is not in transport mode 

If the soft top switch is operated and one of the conditions is not satisfied, the red LED in the soft top 
switch lights up and the opening or closing action is not started. In addition, a Check Control message 
is displayed in the instrument panel. 

A_ 

Do not operate the soft top when the rollover bars of the rollover protection system are extended! 

Operating soft top when the rollover bars of the rollover protection system are extended will result in 
damage of the soft top. 


3.1.2. Standard operation 

The soft top is operated by the soft top switch located in the center console.

Switch 


The operating principle of the soft top switch is similar to that for the power window regulators. 

• Press soft top switch: soft top is opened 

• Pull soft top switch: soft top is closed 

The green LED in the soft top switch is lit while the soft top is moving. If the soft top switch is released 
while the soft top is being opened or closed, the movements of the soft top or the side windows and 
the rear window are immediately interrupted. The red LED in the soft top switch then flashes and a 
Check Control message is displayed in the instrument panel. The movements are resumed when the 
soft top switch is operated again. 

Sequence: Open soft top 

When the soft top switch is pulled, the conditions for opening the soft top are verified by the soft top 
module. If all the conditions are satisfied, the soft top is opened.

3. Operation and Function 

1 If after the closing action the soft top switch remains operated for more than approx. 1.5 seconds or 
is operated again within approx. 1.5 seconds, the side windows and the rear window are closed. 

When the soft top is open, the position of the raised rear window is slightly lower than when the soft 
top is closed. This helps to deflect air turbulence away from the passenger compartment more effec¬ 
tively. 

Sequence: Close soft top 

When the soft top switch is pressed, the conditions for closing the soft top are checked by the soft top 
module. If all the conditions are satisfied, the soft top is closed. 

If the rear window is raised, it is fully lowered. If the side windows are raised, they are only slightly low¬ 
ered.

3.1.3. Convenience functions 

The soft top can also be opened and closed from the outside via the lock barrel with the integrated key. 

On all FI 2 vehicles the soft top to be opened and closed with the ID transmitter, and closed via the 
outside door handle electronics. This is possible since all FI 2 are equipped with comfort access. 

The ignition does not have to be switched on for the soft top convenience functions to work. The ID 
transmitter must however be situated in the immediate vicinity of the car (approx. 1.5 m). Otherwise 
the same prerequisite as for standard operation apply.

FI 2 Soft Top 
4. Information for Service 


The soft top can be adjusted in three directions: vertically, longitudinally and laterally. 

Two soft top main bearing (brackets) connect the soft top to the bodyshell. These are secured by three 
lock nuts and one adjusting nut.

Soft top main bearing 



To adjust the soft top, all the adjusting and lock nuts on the soft top main bearings must be released 
and the washers removed. 

The soft top is vertically adjusted by turning the banjo bolts. The banjo bolts have external threads and 
can be turned in the main bearings with special tool 54 3 000. Turning clockwise raises the soft top, 
turning counterclockwise lowers the soft top. 


42 

















FI 2 Soft Top 
4. Information for Service 


The elongated holes on the soft top main bearing allow the soft top to be longitudinally and laterally 
adjusted. In this way, the soft top can be adjusted in the horizontal direction around the threaded bolts. 

The soft top setting made is secured by tightening down the adjusting nut. Brace the bolt in the pro¬ 
cess. Then fit the washers and tighten down all the lock nuts. 

To finish, it is necessary to check the soft top adjustment in relation to the cowl panel. The guide pins 
on the left and right should drop in the middle into the guide bushes. If this is not possible, the entire 
soft top must be adjusted in the appropriate direction. After adjusting the soft top, it is also necessary 
to adjust the side windows as directed in the repair instructions. 

Tips: 

• To make it easier to adjust the soft top, it is useful before removing the soft top to mark the 
positions of the soft top main bearings on the body. After the repair is completed or when the 
soft top is replaced, the soft top main bearings can be aligned to the markings. 

• If the soft top is being replaced: Before removing the soft top, measure the gap between the 
mounting plate and the soft top main bearing. Carry over these dimensions to the new soft 
top. In this way, the longitudinal adjustment of the soft top is roughly specified. 

• If the soft top is being replaced: Measure the vertical adjustment of the banjo bolts and carry 
over to the new soft top. 


4.4. Breaking in the soft top 

The positions of the main pillars and fins are sensed by the two angle-of-rotation sensors and must be 
signalled to the soft top module. 

The soft top must be broken in (taught) when: 

• the soft top has been replaced 

• a different soft top module control unit has been installed 

• one or both angle-of-rotation sensors have been replaced 

The soft top module is designed in such a way that it can also open and close the soft top in the non- 
taught state. However, the main pillars and fins are always subject to extended strain. The entire soft 
top operation is unharmonious, since other switching points are active. 

Before the soft top module control unit is replaced, the rear window must be fully lowered (if neces¬ 
sary, manually lower the rear window). If an already taught soft top module control unit is to be installed 
in a different vehicle, it must be placed in a non-taught state by means of diagnosis prior to being re¬ 
moved. 

In Service the ISTA diagnosis system can be used to read out the current status, whether the soft top 
module is taught and which values are stored. 

As well as teaching by means of diagnosis, it is possible to teach the closed position by means of a 
switch combination. For this purpose, the soft top switch must be released after the soft top closing 
action within 5 seconds and then operated again for 30 seconds in the "Close" direction. The red and 
green LEDs in the soft top switch light up to indicate successful teaching, otherwise only the red LED 
lights up. No LED lights up if the soft top switch was operated too late or released too early.
