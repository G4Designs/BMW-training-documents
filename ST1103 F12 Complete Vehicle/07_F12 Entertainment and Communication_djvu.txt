2. Head Unit 

2.1. Car Information Computer (CIC) 



FI 2 Car Information Computer 

The CIC head unit was installed for the first time in the BMW 1 and 3 Series vehicles in conjunction 
with the Professional navigation system (option SA 609). This further development of the Car Commu¬ 
nication Computer (CCC) is now also used in the FI 2. 

The head unit provides data management through an internal 80 GB hard drive which enables a multi¬ 
tude of new possibilities. 

This is clearly shown in the audio system particularly with regard to the music storage. Music files can 
be converted (ripped) or copied for compiling music on the hard drive. Fast access to these music files 
is ensured at all times by storing them on this CIC (dedicated) hard drive. It is possible to store up to 
3700 music files in the 12 GB “Media” storage partition. 

As with previous CIC's the digital tuner (IBOC) and satellite tuner (SDARS) digital radio systems are in¬ 
tegrated into the CIC electronics. 

With the FI 2 music player connectivity has been further extended with the introduction of the new 
BMW apps. option (SA-6NR). Among many other features BMW Apps. provides for connection and 
playback of tracks stored on a cell phone music player. 

In contrast to the previous system the tracks stored on a cell phone can now be easily accessed via 
Bluetooth with no “physical” connection to the vehicle. Simple menu navigation and playback of these 
tracks can be controlled via the iDrive system. 

For further information on the Car Information Computer, please refer to the " ST815 Car Information 
Computer (CIC) training material".

3. Speaker Systems 

3.1. Overview 

Two different sound systems are available in the FI 2: 

• Hi-Fi sound system (standard) 

• Premium Hi-Fi system (option SA 677). 

Incorporated in the Hi-Fi system is an eight-channel amplifier with digital equalizer. However, the Hi-Fi 
system only uses seven of the eight channels. 

The bass speakers are located under the front seats. They are coupled either side sill. In this way, the 
volume required for bass reproduction is increased. 

The CIC head unit can be combined with all amplifier/speaker systems. 

In the Hi-Fi system and Premium Hi-Fi system separate speakers are installed for the treble and mid¬ 
ranges. 

For the same diameter of speakers in the Hi-Fi system and Premium Hi-Fi system, there are differ¬ 
ences in speaker performance. This is achieved through the use of different materials such as di¬ 
aphragms, coils and solenoids. 

The Premium Hi-Fi system supports the playback of multichannel formats. Playback of multichannel 
audio formats is possible through the CIC drive or through the optional six-disc DVD changer. 

The Hi-Fi system consists of 9 speakers, the Premium Hi-Fi system of 12 speakers, each with different 
auxiliary amplifiers. 


3.2. Components 


3.2.1. Hi-Fi sound system 

The speakers and the amplifier of the Hi-Fi system are illustrated in the following graphic. The speak¬ 
ers are operated with a power output of 5 x 25 W for the mid-range speakers and tweeters and with 2 x 
40 W for the bass speakers.

3.2.2. Premium Hi-Fi system 

The speakers and the amplifier of the Premium Hi-Fi system are illustrated in the following graphic. 

The speakers are operated with a power output of 5 x 50 W for the mid-range speakers and tweeters 
and with 2 x 125 W for the bass speakers. 

The amplifier of the Premium Hi-Fi system is equipped in the FI 2 with so-called load logic separation. 
Here the amplifier electronics are supplied and connected with a separate voltage line. This is specially 
boosted against short voltage dips and therefore prevents the electronics from failing in the event of a 
short voltage dip.

4.3. Smartphone Integration (BMW Apps SA 6NR) 

Audio playback via an external device (e.g. iPod, USB stick) is already possible due to the way in which 
components of the optional equipment Smartphone Integration SA 6NF have been integrated into 
the vehicle system. Video playback and the Plug in feature are now available in combination with op¬ 
tion BMW Apps (SA 6NR) and the BMW Connected app. This is currently only available for the Ap¬ 
ple™ iPhone™ and is made possible by placing the Smartphone in the specially development “Media” 
snap-in adapter. 

A_ 

Note: The Apple™ iPhone™ is the first Smartphone for which a suitable BMW snap-in adapter 
has been developed. Currently there are several snap in adapters available from BMW for the 
Apple™ iPhone™ depending on vehicle model year, equipment option, available features and 
device version. When addressing a customer complaint please verify that you are using the 
correct snap in adapter for that application. 


The signals that transmit the sounds and images in the video files follow different paths in the vehi¬ 
cle. The image data is sent from the Smartphone to the headunit in the form of an analogColor Video 
Blanking Signal (CVBS) via the video base plate, snap-in adapter and wiring harness. They are con¬ 
verted to a digital low voltage differential signal (LVDS) in the headunit and displayed at the CID. 

The audio signals are sent to the Combox via an AF (audio frequency) signal, then also transmitted to 
the headunit via the Media Oriented System Transport (MOST) bus from where they are then sent to 
the speakers via the HiFi or Top-Hifi amplifier.

A description of the redesigned “Media” snap-in adapter is provided below. This can be ordered via 
the Electronic Parts Catalogunder part number 84 21 9 229 004 for the iPhone™ 3G/3GS and 84 21 
2 199 392 for the iPhone™ 4. Two panels on top of the adapter have been colored silver so it can be 
clearly differentiated from its predecessor.

Label containing information “Video Ready” 


This modified snap-in adapter contains a chip that converts the video signal from the iPhone™ (1 wire 
+ ground) into a differential video signal (CVBS) (2 wires + ground). It also contains resistors that adjust 
the level to 75 ohm. The conversion to 2 wires + ground is made because when a fault occurs with dif¬ 
ferential transmission this occurs on both wires. As the signal is mirrored, the sum of the signal is al¬ 
ways 0 and the fault is therefore absorbed or canceled out. The quality and interference immunity of 
the video transmission via the “Video ready” snap-in adapter is therefore significantly higher. 

A_ 

The cell phone must not be exposed to extreme ambient conditions. At high temperatures, 
functions such as charging can no longer be carried out. In some cases where Web Radio or 
other UMTS data services are continuously used, the iPhone™ can heat up to the point that it 
can lead to deactivation of the charging process at ambient temperatures as low as 23°C/73° 

F. To address this a media snap-in adapter with an integrated fan has been developed part # 

84 21 2 218 390 for iPhone™ 4 and # 84 21 2 218 391 for 3g/3gs. Please refer to the latest Af¬ 
tersales parts bulletin for more information.

4.3.2. Video base plate 

The newly developed video base plate enables the vehicle to access the video data saved on the 
Smartphone. The audio signal of the video clip is connected to the Combox via the video base plate 
(SA6 NF) and iPod and USB adapter (SA 6FL) in the center console. The video signal is transferred to 
the headunit directly via the CVBS signal described above and via the interface of the video base plate. 

In terms of its appearance when installed, the video base plate is no different to the base plate that 
"only" supports audio playback. In order to find out whether a video base plate is installed, the black 
18-pin connector must be removed and the pinning checked. 

The relevant connection between the video base plate and the vehicle electrical system is explained in 
the following graphic:

The control signals for the App (SA 6NR) are transmitted via a 4-core USB data line. The distinguish¬ 
ing feature of the specially developed base plate for extended connectivity of the music player in the 
cell phone is its two gold-plated pins. 

The gold-plated pins also serve as locking pins for the snap-in adapter. The video lines that transmit 
the CVBS signal are located in the 18-pin multi-pin connector. This distinguishes the video base plate 
from the USB base plate used up until now.

6.1. BMW Apps 

Apps, or "applications", have been developed for Smartphones such as the Apple iPhone™ for some 
time now. These apps (or applications) are user programs and are available to download from the In¬ 
ternet either for free or for a charge, (for example from the Apple™ iTunes™ store). Once downloaded, 
the data installs itself on the Smartphone. If a Smartphone is connected to the vehicle, the software re¬ 
mains on the Smartphone and is not transferred to the vehicle. This allows new functions to be devel¬ 
oped more quickly. Therefore development costs are low and not dependent on the life cycle of the ve¬ 
hicles and their hardware (headunits, telephone control units, etc.).

As from December 2010, customers can download the BMW Connected App from the iTunes™ 
Store and install it on their Apple iPhone™. This app is designed to work only in combination with the 
BMW Apps SA 6NR optional equipment and it is only available as from 2011 MY BMW vehicles. 



BMW Connected in Apple iTunes™ portal 


With BMW Apps (option SA 6NR) the Apple™ iPhone™ " Apps" function is now available for the 
first time to BMW customers. These features are activated and controlled via the BMW Drive user in¬ 
terface. An important point to note is that the software for the individual functions is only installed on 
the iPhone and not in the headunit or Combox telephone control unit. The headunit is only required to 
integrate the functions in the vehicle. This means that problem-free functionality of the app depends 
on the app developer and the stability of the iPhone's operating system. 

The Smartphone is connected to the vehicle using the original Apple™ USB cable. Additional func¬ 
tions are available to the customer once the Smartphone has been connected to the vehicle using 
Smartphone Integration cradle (SA 6NF) and the iPhone™ Media snap-in adapter (sold separately). No 
other Smartphones or operating systems Apps are currently supported by the BMW App. SA 6NR 
option. 

A 

Note: Smartphone Integration (SA 6NF) is included when the customer orders the SA 6NR op¬ 
tion. 


With the incorporation of BMW apps option, the menu structure of the Drive system was modified. 
The name of the menu item "BMW Assist" in the main menu was changed to "ConnectedDrive".

The BMW customer can now also access his/her Facebook™ social network in the vehicle with the as¬ 
sistance of BMW Apps. This means the customer can also keep in touch with the contacts in his/her 
social network for the duration of the trip. The user can let the members of his social network know 
about what he/she is currently experiencing: e.g. "I need a filling station fast!". This feature also in¬ 
cludes other pre-prepared messages which are randomly generated by the system. It is also possible 
for users to create their own messages and then post them on the spot. Furthermore, the customer 
can also learn about the status of other members of the social network or read their messages. Mes¬ 
sages can be "read out” with the voice command system option SA 620 (which is included with SA 
609) while the vehicle is moving. This means that the driver can "check" messages without taking his/ 
her eyes off the road. Note that the voice system (Text to Speech) only reads out the message in the 
language set in the headunit. The speech processing system may therefore attempt to read out En¬ 
glish text modules in German. The female voice will then speak German in an English accent.

6.1.3. Web radio 

From the customer's point of view, web radio offers a great deal of added value. The driver of a BMW 
vehicle that is networked with the outside world via the "Web radio" BMW App can receive the signal 
of his/her favorite radio station worldwide. Prerequisites for this process (known as "live streaming") 
are that the program must be listed in the database of broadcast stations and the relevant streaming 
format must be supported. 

Once the app has been successfully activated, the customer can navigate to the "Web radio" submenu 
in the Radio menu and add to several preset "BMW Top stations" by searching for radio stations world¬ 
wide based on selection criteria such as location or genre, and also for local radio stations.

6.1.4. Last Mile & Vehicle Finder 

The Last Mile function was added to the list of BMW Apps in the spring of 2011 and it is available for 
download from the iTunes Portal™ as a “BMW Apps" software update. The Last Mile app guides the 
customer to his actual navigation destination, even if this in a location that is inaccessible to motor ve¬ 
hicles (e.g. pedestrian zone or city parking garage). Navigation continues after the customer has left 
the vehicle and uses the iPhone™ as a navigation tool.

Once the customer has left the vehicle, the coordinates of the vehicle's location are transmitted to 
the iPhone™. It is important in this case to ensure that the Last Mile function is activated before exit¬ 
ing the vehicle. The last destination, next destination and final destination are also transmitted to the 
iPhone™. The last destination is useful in cases where the customer is unable to park at the actual 
destination, heads for the next multi-story parking lot and walks back to the previous destination (e.g. 
museum, theater, restaurant, etc.). The next and final destination become active if the customer has 
entered several destinations in the BMW navigation system route guidance.

6.2. Smartphone Integration (Audio/Video Interface) 

6.2.1. Video playback 

When MTV™ broadcasted the video clip “Video Killed The Radio Star" on 1 st August 1981, this her¬ 
alded the era of the video clip. YouTube™ launched an Internet video portal on 14th February 2005 
where the user can view and upload video clips free of charge. The Internet site contains film and TV 
clips, music videos and self-made films. Since 2007, BMW Group has expanded its Internet presence 
with the site www.bmw.tv where video clips are available to the public (See BMW TV App). The files 
can be downloaded from there in wmv or mp4 format. 

Video clips are therefore now part and parcel of our everyday life and they can now be played in BMW 
vehicles. To do this, a video connection between the vehicle and the Apple™ iPhone™ has been devel¬ 
oped in order to be able to show the video clips from the Smartphone on the vehicle's CID. 


39 





























FI 2 Entertainment and Communication 

6. ConnectedDrive 


A new "Media video base plate" makes it possible to play video clips in BMW vehicles. For safety rea¬ 
sons, this function is only supported when the vehicle is stationary. The video clips are sent to the 
head unit from the iPhone™ via the “Media” snap-in adapter and displayed in the CID. They can be se¬ 
lected and played from the "CD/Multimedia - External audio devices" menu and the "ConnectedDrive 
- Plugin" menu.

6.3. Plugin 

Smartphones are assuming more and more importance among consumers. This is why BMW Group 
made the decision to support the connection of these devices and their software (referred to as apps) 
to the vehicle electrical system. Plugin allows the user to switch from the familiar BMW user interface 
(iDrive controller in conjunction with the Central Information Display) to the Apple™ interface. This plu¬ 
gin essentially supports the iPod™ function and features of the iPhone™. 

The Plugin menu item allows the customer to enjoy the look and feel of an Apple™ interface when 
the iPhone™ is connected to the vehicle. The control signals in this case are transmitted via USB data 
connections. The picture signals are rendered by the iPhone™ and output as video signal via CVBS.

6.3.1. Starting Plugin 

Before starting the Plugin feature make sure that the iPhone™ is connected via the “Media” snap in 
adapter in the center console. Once Plugin has been selected, the connection between the iPhone™ 
and the vehicle is checked. Select the “Plugin” button to start the function. In doing so, it is important 
to be aware that when the function is started, the usual BMW iDrive “turn-press-push" environment 
no longer applies. Although the push function no longer exists the user navigates through the menu by 
turning and pressing the controller and can still jump back one step via the “Back” button. Press the 
"Menu" button to exit the Plugin function and return to the main menu of the BMW iDrive system.

6.3.2. Genius music mixes 

To give the customer an added benefit, iPhone™ Genius mixes can now also be accessed. Genius 
mixes browses the iTunes™ Media Library on the iPhone™ and automatically generates up to twelve 
genre-based mixes containing tracks that (according to the Apple™ Genius) "work well together". It is 
not possible to influence the selection directly. These mixes are compiled based on the experience of 
the worldwide iTunes™ community. The playlist generated by Genius can be saved on the iPhone™ or 
updated from time to time.

7. Self-diagnosis 

The ’’BMW Connected” app on the iPhone™ includes a self-diagnosis function which can be used for 
troubleshooting in order to eliminate faults more quickly and systematically. If the BMW Connected 
app is not working properly, the customer can start the "self-diagnosis" via his iPhone™. In doing so, 
the iPhone™ must not initially be connected to the vehicle via the USB port. Once the self-diagnosis 
has been started, the customer will be prompted to connect the iPhone™ to the vehicle via the USB 
cable. Once the self-diagnosis has been completed, a nine-digit fault code is displayed for the cus¬ 
tomer. 



BMW iPhone™ App Self-diagnosis code retrieval. 


The customer can then quote that code to the Service department. Alternatively, the Service employ¬ 
ee will need to start the self-diagnosis via the customer's iPhone™ then note down the fault. Once the 
self-diagnosis is complete, the customer can take his iPhone™ with him, even if the vehicle has to re¬ 
main in the workshop because the fault has not yet been eliminated. The test plan AT8400_A4A can 
be called up on ISTA and ISTA Client. The test plan prompts you to enter the iPhone diagnostic code. 
By entering the fault code in the diagnosis system, the fault can be traced back to the iPhone™, vehi¬ 
cle or connection (snap-in adapter) between the end device and vehicle.

FI 2 Entertainment and Communication 

7. Self-diagnosis 



Diagnosis system - input of fault code and display of iPhone™ details 

Faults that are attributable to the iPhone™ will not be repaired by BMW Service and must be remedied 
by the manufacturer of the end device or relevant app provider. 

In order to trace faults on the vehicle, the service employee must perform a short test and run the 
telecommunication test plan (AT8400_SYSTEL). The relevant test module for evaluating the test code 
is integrated in this plan (A4A - Application 4 Automotive). The test code is decoded by the test plan. 
This provides the service employee with all of the necessary information. He is then able to perform a 
focussed diagnosis. 

The test code can be evaluated on a workshop computer (e.g. service advisor's computer). A function¬ 
al ISTA client must be installed on this computer. The vehicle can be identified via the chassis number 
or its basic characteristics using the ISTA Client. Then a free test search can be made for the test mod¬ 
ule AT8400_A4A - Test code evaluation for service advisors in order to run the module. The test mod¬ 
ule can also be found at: Information search - Functional structure - Body - Audio, Video, Telephone, 
Navigation - Telecommunication - Documents - BMW Connected. This test module is only intended to 
be a source of information for service advisors and does not generate a diagnosis code. If a diagnosis 
code is needed, proceed as described in section Dealing with problems in the workshop.
