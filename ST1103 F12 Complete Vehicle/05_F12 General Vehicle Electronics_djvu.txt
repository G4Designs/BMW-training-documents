2.2. Special features 

The vehicle electrical system of the FI 2 is based on the F01 (vehicle electrical system NB2020). 

FlexRay is also used in the FI 2 as the system bus for networking of the systems that control the dy¬ 
namic handling characteristics and engine control. The central gateway module ZGM contains two star 
couplers with eight bus drivers. The bus drivers forward the data of the control units via the commu¬ 
nication controller to the central gateway module (ZGM). The FlexRay control units are connected to 
these bus drivers. 

To avoid reflections on the lines, both ends of the data lines are terminated with resistors. 

The FI 2 has Ethernet access in order to be able to program the complete vehicle quickly. It has been 
possible to discontinue access via the Media Oriented System Transport bus system for programming 
purposes thanks to the extremely high data transfer rate of the Ethernet (100 MBit/s). 

The body controller area network 2 (K-CAN2) facilitates communication between control units with 
a high data transfer rate (500 kBit/s). The K-CAN2 is also connected to the other bus systems via the 
central gateway module (ZGM). 

The Powertrain Controller Area Network 2 (PT-CAN2) serves as a redundant system for the Powertrain 
Controller Area Network (PT-CAN) in the area of engine and transmission control unit and also to for¬ 
ward signals to the electric fuel pump.

FI 2 General Vehicle Electronics 

3. Voltage supply 

The voltage supply concept of the FI 2 is based on current BMW models. The components and layout 
used are essentially the same. 


3.1. Components 

Due to the steady increase of electrical functions for comfort, communication and safety in BMW vehi¬ 
cles, the voltage supply is becoming ever more important. 

Five separate power distribution boxes are installed in the FI 2: 

• Power distribution box in the engine compartment 

• Power Distribution Module PDM in engine compartment (only on 640i with the N55B3000 en¬ 
gine). 

• Junction box for the power distribution box next to the glove box 

• Luggage compartment power distribution box on right side of the luggage compartment 

• Battery power distribution box. 

The junction box comprises the junction box power distribution box and junction box electronics (JBE).

3. Voltage supply 

Three main power lines are routed along the vehicle underbody of the FI 2 from the luggage compart¬ 
ment to the engine compartment: 

• A main power line runs from the safety battery terminal (SBK) to the starter motor and alterna¬ 
tor via the positive battery connection point. Copper cable with a cross-section of 50 mm 2 is 
used up to the transition connection point below the luggage compartment floor and alumini¬ 
um cable with a cross-section of 80 mm 2 is used from this point onwards. 

• The second main power line supplies voltage to the Power Distribution Module (PDM). This 
copper cable has a cross-section of 16 mm 2 and is protected by a high-current circuit breaker 
in the battery power distribution box. 

• The third main power line runs to the power distribution box in the engine compartment. Cur¬ 
rent is supplied to the electrical fan via this power distribution box. This line is also protected 
by the high-current circuit breaker in the battery power distribution box and is a copper cable 
with a cross-section of 25 mm 2 . 

Two additional battery cables run through the vehicle interior to the luggage compartment power dis¬ 
tribution box and one battery cable runs to the junction box for the power distribution box. Each of the 
three battery cables is protected by a high-current circuit breaker in the battery power distribution box. 

To prevent the main power lines on the vehicle underbody from being damaged, these are laid in a pro¬ 
tected zone. 


3.1.1. Battery 

Voltage in the FI 2 is always supplied by a 90 Ah AGM (absorbent glass matt) battery. The vehicle bat¬ 
tery is installed at the rear of the luggage compartment in the Center. 



AGM battery 


With the introduction of the FI 0, the intelligent battery sensor (IBS) has been used to improve the bat¬ 
tery condition detection. The following criteria are used to establish whether or not the battery in the 
FI 2 is defective and needs to be replaced: 

• Identification of faulty battery cells in the vehicle battery 

• Establishing the remaining capacity of the vehicle battery 

• Battery water loss detected 


11 


FI 2 General Vehicle Electronics 

3. Voltage supply 


• Long immobilization period with low state of charge 

• Charge capacity 

• Charge balance when the vehicle is at a standstill 

• Charge balance during journey 

• Lowest permitted discharging 

These criteria are recorded using the measured values obtained from the intelligent battery sensor and 
other measured variables of the voltage supply. The measured values are then evaluated using math¬ 
ematical models. Only specific criteria may be used to determine the battery condition, depending on 
the driving style and equipment used in the vehicle.

The battery condition detection determines whether the battery needs to be replaced based on the 
severity and number of defects detected. Furthermore, the vehicle user is notified via the "Change 
battery" Check Control message that a problem may exist. The fault entry can only be deleted once 
the vehicle battery change service function has been carried out. 

The condition of the battery can be read out during service via the "battery condition" or "energy diag¬ 
nosis" procedures ("General information / battery" menu) in order to determine whether it needs to be 
replaced.

3.3. Energy management 

The FI 2 energy management has been extended to include a number of functions. 

3.3.1. Charge condition display 

If the FI 2 is in transport mode, the battery's state of charge is continuously displayed when in opera¬ 
tion. The carrier can therefore charge the battery on time in order to prevent deep discharging of the 
battery, and therefore damage to the battery:

FI 2 General Vehicle Electronics 

3. Voltage supply 

3.3.2. Influence of steering power 

The power consumption of the electric power steering (EPS) is extremely high. In order to avoid a 
brief reduction in the steering servo availability, the energy management of the FI 2 anticipates and re¬ 
sponds to steering-intensive driving maneuvers (parking or three-point turns). To do this, specific in¬ 
put variables (e.g. vehicle speed, brake pedal operation and steering angle) are evaluated. The energy 
management can implement the following measures: 

• Raise the idling speed and adjust the ignition timing to increase the engine torque 

• Increase the vehicle voltage via the alternator 

• Turn off convenience functions (heated rear window, outside mirror heating system and seat 
heating). 


3.4. Supply to EPS 

The voltage supply to the Electric Power Steering (EPS) varies depending on which equipment in¬ 
stalled in the vehicle: 

• Vehicles without Integral Active Steering (SA 2VH): 12V 

• Vehicles with Integral Active Steering (SA 2VH): 24 V. 

With this version, the steering servo is fully electric. In vehicles with Integral Active Steering (SA 2VH), 
the Electric Power Steering (EPS) is combined with a planetary gearbox with override function. 

For more information on the Electric Power Steering (EPS), refer to the FI 2 Chassis Dynamics section 
of this training material.

4. Car Access System 

The fourth generation Car Access System used in current BMW models is also used in the FI 2. With it 
comes the full functionality of Comfort Access integrated into the Car Access System. 

As of series introduction, the drive authorization (Passive Go) system is fitted as standard equipment in 
the FI 2. Drive authorization allows the customer to start the engine without actively using the remote 
key or ID transmitter. Vehicles equipped with drive authorization require no insertion slot. An ID trans¬ 
mitter or remote key only needs to be somewhere inside the passenger compartment for the engine to 
be started. 

The remote key/ID transmitter comprises, among other things: 

• A battery 

• Remote control function 

• Transponder coil for emergency start function 

• Spare key 

• Receiver unit. 

Up to eight remote keys/ID transmitters can be used with a particular vehicle. The battery has a four 
year estimated service life.

4.2. Overview of functions 

The Car Access System performs, among other functions, the role of central control unit via which the 
vehicle is accessed and locked. Consequently, the Car Access System has full responsibility for the 
central locking system. 

The Car Access System incorporates the following functions for the FI 2: 

• Comfort Access 

• Central locking system 

• Power window regulators 

• Terminal control 

• Electronic immobilizer. 

Other functions of the Car Access System are: 

• Vehicle data storage 

• Data transfer for Conditioned Based Service (CBS) 

• Plausibility check of signals from remote key/ID transmitter. 

Various functions are released or suppressed by the Car Access System. However, other control units 
are involved in actually carrying out these functions: 

• Junction box electronics (JBE) 

• Footwell module (FRM) 

• Roof function Center (FZD). 

For the purposes of communication with other components of the vehicle electrical system, the Car 
Access System is connected to the K-CAN2, CAS data bus and local interconnect network bus. 

The Car Access System analyzes the status of the hood contact switch and broadcasts it for use by 
the alarm system. 

The Car Access System also analyzes the status of the following buttons and initiates the central lock¬ 
ing function. 


23 







FI 2 General Vehicle Electronics 

4. Car Access System 

• Button for central locking system on dashboard 

• Trunk lid push-button on A-pillar 

• Central locking system button on inside of trunk. 

The Car Access System supplies voltage to the brake light switch and also analyzes its status. 

A remote key/ID transmitter must be located in the passenger compartment in order for the engine 
to be started. The engine can now be started by pressing the start/stop button with the brake pedal 
pressed and the vehicle is operational. 

For a more detailed description of the functions, please read the " F01/F02 Car Access System" train¬ 
ing material available on TIS and ICR

FI 2 General Vehicle Electronics 

5. Comfort Access 


Using Comfort Access, the customer can unlock and open the vehicle without actively using the ID 
transmitter irrespective of where in the vehicle the customer wishes to gain access. It is sufficient if the 
ID transmitter is in the immediate vicinity (within a range of about. 1.5 m) of the vehicle. 

Comfort Access first featured in the E65 (03/2002) then was successively introduced in various BMW 
models. The FI 2 is standard equipment from series introduction. 

The benefits of Comfort Access are: 

• High level of operating convenience when unlocking and locking the vehicle 

• Convenient and fast access to the vehicle 

• Simple engine start/shutdown procedure 

• Maximum comfort for the driver. 

The Comfort Access that features in the FI 2 is a version that is based on predecessor systems and 
has been adapted to the requirements of the FI 2. As is the case with current BMW models, the entire 
function is incorporated into the Car Access System which means the FI 2 also has no separate Com¬ 
fort Access control unit. 

If the ID transmitter has been detected and is grasped by a hand reaching into the handle recess of the 
outer door handle on one of the doors, the vehicle unlocks and can then be opened by pulling the out¬ 
er door handle. 

If the ID transmitter is outside the vehicle and the sensitive surface on the outer door handle of one of 
the doors is touched, the vehicle locks. 

Comfort Access is divided into the following functions: 

• Access authorization (Passive Entry) 

• Drive authorization (Passive Go) 

• Locking authorization (Passive Exit). 

For a more detailed description of the functions, refer to the "F01/F02 Comfort Access " training ma¬ 
terial available on TIS and ICR

6. Central locking system 

The central locking system locks and unlocks all doors, the fuel filler flap and trunk centrally. It is in¬ 
stalled in the FI 2 as standard and can be operated via the following components: 

• Remote key/ID transmitter 

• Driver's door lock barrel (door lock) 

• Outer door handle 

• Button for central locking system on dashboard 

• Button for central locking system on inside of trunk 

• Trunk lid push-button on A-pillar 

• Trunk lid push-button on outside of trunk lid (integrated in BMW badge). 

The FI 2 has no lock in the Trunk lid that can be unlocked mechanically. 

The central locking system in the FI 2 is based on the familiar central locking system that already fea¬ 
tures in the E70, E90 or F01/F02.

6.2. Overview of functions 

The function of the central locking system is basically divided between two control units. 

• The Car Access System assumes the central control function. The Car Access System knows 
what the system statuses of the central locking system are which is why the Car Access Sys¬ 
tem authorizes the unlocking, locking and deadlocking of the vehicle. 

• The junction box electronics executes the requests to unlock or lock the vehicle. 

The vehicle can be unlocked and locked actively or passively. 


30 
















FI 2 General Vehicle Electronics 

6. Central locking system 

Active means that the vehicle can be opened after it has been unlocked by pressing the button on 
the remote key/ID transmitter. The vehicle can be locked by pressing the "lock" button after the doors 
have been closed. 

A_ 

The vehicle can only be locked when the driver's door is closed.

7.2. Examples of the signal path 

The following examples show the signal paths before the power window motors open or close the side 
windows and rear window. As a prerequisite, operation of the power windows must have been enabled 
by the Car Access System. 

7.2.1. Switch block, driver's door 

If the front left or front right power window switch is pressed, the signal is routed to the footwell mod¬ 
ule via the local interconnect network (LIN) bus. The footwell module controls the relevant power win¬ 
dow motor. 

If the rear left or rear right power window switch is pressed, the signal from the switch block in the 
driver's door is routed to the footwell module via the local interconnect network (LIN) bus. The footwell 
module sends the signal to the junction box electronics via the body controller area network 2 (K-CAN 
2). The junction box electronics (JBE) controls the relevant power window motor. 


33 














FI 2 General Vehicle Electronics 

7. Power window regulator 


If the rear window power window switch is pressed, the signal from the switch block in the driver's 
door is sent to the footwell module (FRM) via the local interconnect network (LIN) bus. The footwell 
module sends the signal to the convertible top module (CVM) via the body controller area network 2 
(K-CAN 2). The convertible top module (CVM) actuates the relay that lowers or raises the rear window 
and receives the signals from the hall effect sensors via which the position of the rear window is identi¬ 
fied. The rear-window drive is actuated via the relay that lowers or raises the rear window.

passenger door is operated. The junction box electronics sends the signal to the footwell module 
(FRM) via the body controller area network 2 (K-CAN 2). The footwell module controls the relevant 
power window motor.

FI 2 General Vehicle Electronics 

8. Anti-theft system 

The Anti-theft system (DWA) is standard equipment of the FI 2. Its purpose is to indicate when the 
vehicle is accessed without authorization by emitting an alarm warning. The alarm can be activated 
acoustically or visually. To do this, the alarm system must be activated. When activated, the alarm sys¬ 
tem monitors the whole of the vehicle interior. 

In addition the alarm system monitors the engine compartment and the vehicle's rest position. In order 
that nothing can be stolen from the luggage compartment, the alarm system monitors opening of the 
trunk lid. 

The alarm system also signals when an attempt is made to tamper with the vehicle, e.g. by cutting 
through the feed line to the siren with tilt alarm sensor (SINE). 

The passenger compartment is monitored by four MuW (multiplex microwave sensors) sensors in to¬ 
tal via a radar-based measuring procedure. These are located behind the door and side trim panels. 
When monitoring is in progress the MuW sensors detect all movements and directions of movement. 
The siren with tilt alarm sensor (SINE) activates the MuW sensors. 

The siren with tilt alarm sensor SINE is located on the right, on the bumper side support.

• the door contacts, by the footwell module (FRM) 

• the engine compartment lid contact switch, by the Car Access System (CAS) 

• the rear lid contact switch, by the junction box electronics (JBE). 

As soon as a status changes, the siren with tilt alarm sensor (SINE) receives a corresponding signal. If 
the alarm system is activated, an alarm is triggered.

9. Exterior lights 

The exterior lights of the FI 2 are based on most current BMW models. 

The standard equipment of the FI 2 includes bi-xenon headlights. The daytime running lights and side 
lights are implemented in the corona rings using LED technology and thus guarantee a high recogni¬ 
tion value in traffic. 

The LEDs can be operated in two power stages. When dimmed to roughly 10% of their maximum 
power they operate as side lights, while at full power they operate as daytime driving lights. 

The daytime driving lights are activated when the vehicle is started. If the automatic lighting system 
switches the low-beam headlight on, or if the driver switches the side lights or low-beam headlight on 
at the light switch himself, the light ring changes automatically to side lights. 

A white LED positioning light (eyebrow) is installed. 

The fog light has been implemented in LED technology for the first time in the FI 2. 

For more information on exterior lights, refer to the “ F01/F02 Exterior lights" training material available 
on TIS and ICP.

10. Interior light 


The interior lighting of the FI 2 is controlled via the footwell module (FRM) control unit. 

The footwell module is the central control unit for the interior lighting system. All interior light outputs 
of the footwell module are pulse-width-modulated. This ensures that the brightness of the interior 
lighting remains uniform in the event of voltage fluctuations. The pulse width modulation is also used 
for the soft ON/soft OFF function. 

The components of the interior light in the front roof area are integrated in the roof function center 
(FZD) and in the sun visors. The footwell lighting is located on the underside of the dashboard. Voltage 
is supplied to the rear reading and passenger-compartment lights via the roof function center.

10.2. Examples of switching operations 

If a door is opened when the vehicle is unlocked, the status of the relevant door contact changes. The 
footwell module (FRM) evaluates the status and sends the request to switch on the interior light. Par¬ 
allel to this, the footwell module (FRM) switches on the door entry lighting for the open door, the door 
entry lighting and footwell lighting. 

The status of the door contact changes again when the door is closed. The footwell module initiates 
the procedure to switch off the interior light. 

The luggage compartment lights are connected to the voltage supply via terminal 30B. If the trunk lid 
is opened, the luggage compartment light and trunk lid light are switched on via the trunk contact.

means they are also visible to the occupants when seated. 

The front seats feature a rear easy-entry facility via the forward/back seat adjustment and a backrest 
forwards-folding mechanism.

In contrast to the E63, the handle for the backrest forwards-folding mechanism is located directly on 
the reversing mechanism. It no longer needs to be operated in order to fold back the backrest. 

Depending on the seat position, the seat and/or head restraint move downwards when the backrest is 
folded forwards. 

If the backrest does not engage correctly after it has been folded back, a Check Control message is 
displayed in the instrument panel (KOMBI). 

The seat can be moved into the required position by pressing the rear easy-entry facility button. The 
movement stops when the button is released. If the seat is adjusted backwards, it moves into its origi¬ 
nal position. 

If the rear easy-entry facility button is only briefly pressed, the seat moves into the corresponding end 
position. The movement can be stopped by pressing the button again.

Automatic tensioner with adaptive force limiter 


The inertia reel is located below the seat pan of the front seat which means the rear seat passengers 
have more knee room than in the E64 and also reduces the weight of the backrest. 

The front seats are equipped with seat occupancy detection and belt tensioners.
