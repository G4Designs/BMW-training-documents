FI 2 Introduction

2.1. Bodyshell 



FI 2 Bodyshell 


2.1.1. Overview 

Great emphasis was placed on the use of lightweight materials in the design and construction of the 
FI 2 bodyshell. This is achieved with the intelligent application of higher-strength multi-phase steels 
and super-strength hot-formed steels. The FI 2 sees an increase in the average strength of its body 
materials of 29 % compared with the E64. 

The use of lightweight materials in conjunction with a rigid bodyshell design results in the enhance¬ 
ment of the following areas: 

• Driving dynamics 

• Reducing fuel consumption 

• Reducing CO 2 emissions 

• Passive safety. 


4 


FI 2 Introduction 

2. Body 

Special features 

• Die-cast aluminium suspension-strut mountings 

• High proportion of multi-phase steels (16 % of the bodyshell weight) 

• High proportion of hot-formed steels (6 % of the bodyshell weight). 

The die-cast aluminium spring strut towers stiffen the front end and thereby improve the driving dy¬ 
namics. The use of aluminium in the front end also contributes to uniform axle-load distribution. This in 
conjunction with the strut brace mounted between the front panel, spring strut towers and bulkhead, 
provides for a homogeneous distribution of stiffness which facilitates the absorption and dissipation of 
all the vertical, longitudinal and lateral forces in the event of a collision. 

The higher-strength multi-phase steels and super-strength hot-formed steels ensure maximum 
strength of the safety occupant cell (passenger compartment) with low weight, thus making a huge 
contribution to passive safety. 

Along with hot-formed steels, an innovative new development, passive corrosion-proofing, is used. In 
the past, there were no suitable hot-formed sheet metal materials with galvanized corrosion-proofing 
available on the market. However, with the development of press-hardening technology there is now a 
process of manufacturing galvanized hot-formed components that is capable of application in volume 
production. 

It involves initially cold-forming galvanized sheet steel and then heating it to approx. 900 °C/1252 °F. 
Immediately afterwards it is cooled directly in the moulding die with integrated water cooling within 
just a few seconds down to approximately 70 °C/158 °F and thereby hardened. That process gives the 
components a minimum yield strength of well over 1000 MPa. 

The parts produced in that way can be used in areas exposed to moisture without suffering corrosion 
of the basic material. The advantage with type of steel is that it does not require any additional corro¬ 
sion-proofing measures. 

2.1.2. Materials 

A modern vehicle body must meet a great many requirements. Despite small outer dimensions, it 
should provide an interior that is a large as possible while providing the highest level of protection 
in the event of an accident. The torque that is generated also means that the engine and transmis¬ 
sion, rely on the body for support. Furthermore, the body must have high static and above all dynamic 
strength in order to guarantee the outstanding driving characteristics that are typical of BMW. 

Last but not least, the supporting structure of the vehicle must be highly durable and, in the event of an 
accident, it must be possible for repairs to be carried out at a reasonable cost and without an excessive 
amount of work. 

In order to meet all these requirements in the optimum way, BMW pursues the strategy of manufactur¬ 
ing each component from the material that best suits its function. 

The two expressions aluminium and steel are merely generic terms for the large number of alloys with 
very different properties that are deployed.

Multi-phase steels are steels where the structure consists of a number of phases. Higher-strength 
multi-phase steels with a yield strength R p0 .2 of 300 to 600 MPa are, for example, dual-phase steels or 
TRIP steels. Super-strength multi-phase steels with a yield strength R p0 .2 in excess of 600 MPa are, 
for example, complex-phase steels or martensitic-phase steels. 

Hot-formed manganese-boron steels are super-strength steels with a yield strength R p0 .2 in excess of 
900 MPa. 

Weight proportions 

In order to reduce the vehicle weight and still ensure maximum strength of the bodyshell, the propor¬ 
tion of higher/super-strength multi-phase steels, super-strength hot-formed steels and aluminium 
used is growing.

2.1.3. Corrosion protection and leak resistance 

Primarily galvanized sheet iron and aluminium sheets are used in the FI 2 body to optimize corrosion 
protection. Welding, bonding and riveting processes are used as joining methods. 

The overlaps of the metal plates are designed in such a way that the join surfaces are minimized. This 
prevents bondline corrosion. Water is prevented from entering the body structure by means of con¬ 
structive bonding and sealing of the join surfaces. 


In particularly critical areas, expansion foam parts are used to seal the body cavities against moisture. 
Double-sheet panels in wet areas are double-sealed and, if necessary, also cavity-filled with wax. 


13 











FI 2 Introduction 

2. Body 

Where required, the overlaps of the metal plates in dry chambers are sealed off to prevent dust from 
entering. 

Risks of corrosion are avoided by using optimum processes. 

Coating process 

In the painting process in the immersion cleaning unit, the bodyshell 

• is cleaned by alkali 

• is phosphated (roughing of the surface for better adhesion) 

• is coated in the immersion process using cathodic dip-painting (anticorrosive paint which 
coats all the body cavities from both the inside and the outside) 

The organic coat is then baked at up to 200 °C/392 °F 

Furthermore, the body is sealed with PVC and protected by filler, top coat and clear varnish on the out¬ 
er skin. 

The objectives are: 

• No visible corrosion in the outer skin area for five years 

• No visible corrosion in the underbody area for three years 

• No rust penetration for twelve years 

• High leak-tightness against water and dust.

2.2. Rollover protection system 

The rollover protection system is installed as standard behind the rear head restraints and is used for 
passive safety purposes. 

In the event of the car rolling over, two rollover bars extend from the module within fractions of a sec¬ 
ond and lock positively. This, together with the reinforced windshield frame, secures the cabin space 
for the occupants. 

If an accident situation that is critical to the car's occupants is identified by the electrical system's sen¬ 
sor system and signalled to the Crash Safety Module (ACSM). The module outputs a signal for activat¬ 
ing the two pyrotechnical actuators in the rollover protection system. 

The actuators release the spring-loaded rollover bars. The two rollover bars extend and lock in their 
end position by means of pawl/gear strip.

2.3. Pedestrian protection 

Several pedestrian protection features have been incorporated in the FI 2 front section. An impact ab¬ 
sorber is installed between the bumper support and the bumper trim to cushion leg impact. The hood 
is made from aluminium and is fitted with deformation elements. These design measures are intended 
to produce a defined reduction of energy in the event of an accident. 


2.4. Doors 

Frame less doors with sheet aluminium shell design are installed in the FI 2. 


16 




FI 2 Introduction 

2. Body 



FI 2 Door 


Large sheet metal braces that transfer force in the door area ensure high rigidity and component qual¬ 
ity with the smallest tolerances. The implementation of high draw depths and a new component sep¬ 
aration (hinge reinforcement and inner door panel) have enable a sophisticated design / contour in the 
exterior. 


Advantages of these design features are: 


Reduced CO 2 emissions and increased driving dynamics thanks to reduced weight 
(approx. 14 kg/30 lbs per vehicle in relation to a comparable steel variant) 

The highest form stability of individual parts as a result of one-part inner door panels 

Lowest possible number of components for the door structure 

Laser welding and structural adhesive bonding as methods of joining the door structure 


Aluminium door structures have already featured frequently in BMWs in the past, e.g. in the E52, E63, 
E64 and E36 M3. Aluminium doors have been manufactured for vehicles in high quantities since the 
F01. The aim of developing the door structure was to implement a door concept of sheet aluminium 
shell design which can also be manufactured in higher quantities at acceptable costs. 

However, from a production engineering point of view the manufacture of sheet aluminium shell parts 
is more demanding than steel, especially at high draw depths, due to the fact that aluminium is hard¬ 
er to work. By developing a new structural concept with large shells capable of transmitting force, pro¬ 
duction capability could be ensured without having to depart from the proven sheet-metal shell design 

The FI 2 is the first Convertible to feature a drop-type rear side window with anti-trap mechanism.

Lightweight construction grade 

1 

E64 model year 2004 

2 

FI 2 model year 2011 


Static torsional rigidity refers to the distortions of the body about an axis when subjected to a torque. 
Because there is a conflict of objectives between lightweight construction and rigidity, static torsional 
rigidity is never considered on its own; instead, the lightweight construction grade is also considered. 

The lightweight construction grade describes the static torsional rigidity value in relation to the contact 
area (toe x wheelbase) and to the weight of the bodyshell (without doors and compartment lids). It is a 
measure of what rigidity has been achieved with what small amount of mass for a given contact area. 

In the FI 2 it has been possible to achieve a lightweight construction grade of 3.6 through intelligent 
geometrical layout of the load paths in conjunction with lightweight material construction.

• Center armrest storage compartment (with cup holder for manual gearbox). 

The latch for the center armrest is linked to the central locking system. 

3.2.4. Front seats 

Lightweight front seats with integrated belts are used in the FI 2. They are low in height, thereby facili¬ 
tating a low seat position. This has made it possible to deliver among other things a flat roof line in the 
F12. 

The use of higher-strength steels has reduced the wall thicknesses of the seat structure and with it re¬ 
duced the weight of the seats. This has made the front seats much narrower, especially in the back¬ 
rests. Omitting the belt height adjusters has also helped to reduce the weight. 

The backrests of the front seats are no longer fitted with conventional rear panels; instead they have 
bag-type covers, flanked on either side by a plastic trim. 



FI 2 Front seat 


Unlike the E63/E64, the FI 2 uses the same front seats as the FI 3 Coupe. 
The front seats of FI 2 offer the same functionality as those of the F01.

The FI 2 features for the first time seat adjustment with memory buttons situated at the top so that 
they are also visible to the occupant while sitting. 

The front seats also have a rear easy-entry facility by means of forward/back seat adjustment and a 
mechanical backrest tilt-forward facility.

Before driving off, tilt the backrest back and lock in place, otherwise there is a risk of accident due to 
unexpected seat movement. 


The handle for tilting the backrest forwards is, unlike its predecessor, mounted directly on the seat belt 
guide loop. It does not have to be operated to tilt the backrest back. 

Depending on the seat position, the seat and/or the head restraint are adjusted downwards when the 
backrest is tilted forwards. 

If the backrest fails to engage correctly when it is tilted back, a Check Control message is displayed in 
the instrument panel.

The seat can be moved into the desired position by pressing the rear easy-entry facility button. Re¬ 
leasing the button stops the seat's movement. If the seat is adjusted towards the rear, it returns to its 
original position. 

If the rear easy-entry facility button is only briefly pressed, the seat moves to its respective end posi¬ 
tion. Pressure the button again stops the seat's movement. 

Seat heating 

The buttons for operating seat heating are located in the integrated automatic heating/air conditioning 
system control panel.

The side head airbag is not located under the seat cover, but instead is mounted in the form of a con¬ 
tainer solution to the side of the seat frame. 

Seat belt 

The FI 2 features front seats with integrated seat belt systems, making the belts much easier to ac¬ 
cess.

The automatic reel is located under the front seat pan, thereby reducing the weight of the backrest. 

The front seats are equipped with belt tensioners, and the front passenger seat is additionally 
equipped with a seat occupancy detector. 

3.2.5. Wind deflector 

A wind deflector can be ordered for the FI 2. 

When installed, the wind deflector deflects the air turbulence generated by the air flow away from the 
passenger compartment. This provides for a comfortable drive with the soft top open, particularly at 
higher speeds. 

The upper frame of the wind deflector can where necessary be manually folded down or placed in the 
upright position again. When not being used, the wind deflector is kept in the supplied storage pouch 
in the luggage compartment to save space.

FI 2 Wind deflector 

The wind deflector for the FI 2 is, apart from the longer bolts and mounting arms, identical to the wind 
deflector for the E64. 

3.2.6. Climate control 

The FI 2 is equipped with 2/2-zone integrated automatic heating/air conditioning (IHKA). 

The first number denotes the number of controllable temperature zones (temperature selector wheels) 
and the second number the number of controllable airflow volume and air distribution zones (separate 
fan settings).
