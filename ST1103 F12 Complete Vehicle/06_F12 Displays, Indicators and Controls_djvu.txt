FI 2 Displays, Indicators and Controls 

1. System overview 

1.1. Introduction 

As with all other BMW models, the operating concept of the new BMW 6-Series convertible is based 
on a clear and optimized layout of the instruments and controls. The number of switches has been re¬ 
duced in order to simplify logical operation. The display and operating elements are organized in a hi¬ 
erarchical arrangement corresponding to their function.

FI 2 Displays, Indicators and Controls 

2. System components 

2.1. Instrument panel 

As with previous BMW models the FI 2 instrument cluster arranges and displays the speedometer, 
tachometer, fuel gauge, engine oil temperature, indicators and warning lights clearly. 

The instrument cluster (KOMBI) receives information in analogand digital electrical signals via the 
wiring harness. These signals are processed and then displayed, or passed on as information to other 
control units. 

The FI 2 cluster is a further development of the F01 instrument cluster and, as a control unit, is a bus 
component of the MOST bus (Media Oriented System Transport) bus and powertrain CAN (PT-CAN). 



FI 2 Instrument cluster 


2.1.1. Brake energy regeneration 

The Brake energy regeneration display is faded into the current consumption display in coasting (over¬ 
run) mode. 

The kinetic energy of the vehicle is converted into electrical energy during coasting. The vehicle bat¬ 
tery is partially recharged and the fuel consumption can be reduced. 



FI 2 Fuel economy display in coasting (overrun) mode 


2.1.2. On-board computer 

As with all BMW vehicles the FI 2 is equipped as standard with an on-board computer. 

The on-board computer functions can be called up by briefly pressing the on-board computer button 
on the steering column switch.

2.2. Central information display 

The central information display (CID) has been redesigned for the FI 2. 

As with all new BMW models, the system is operated by means of the iDrive system controller. 

The central information display is an integrated display and operating facility for the following func¬ 
tions: 


Audio functions, such as radio, CD, MP3 for example 

Telephone and data services 

Navigation

2.3. Head-Up Display 

The name "Head-Up" describes the principle benefit of this system. The Head-Up Display (HUD) 
projects a virtual image into the driver's field of view. Important information, e.g. from the cruise control 
or navigation system with activated arrow display, is reflected on the windshield and is therefore per¬ 
manently available in the driver's field of view. 

The Head-Up Display is part of the Driver Assistance Package (SA ZDA) in the FI 2. The HUD contains 
various functions aimed at enhancing driving safety and ride comfort. 

The following information is displayed: 

• Vehicle speed 

• Set speed regulation by the cruise control with braking function (DCC) 

• Navigation system 

• Check Control messages 

• Seed limit information 

• Lane departure warning 

• Night Vision with pedestrian detection 

The HUD used in the FI 2 has been enhanced to include the following functions:

2. System components 


• Intersection view 

• Road symbol in the junction view. 

The HUD in the FI 2 can now also project the color blue in addition to red and green. Contents can be 
displayed in all colors of the RGB color spectrum, as is the case with an LCD monitor, by mixing the 
three colors. 

Having the displays in the driver's direct field of view increases safety, as this allows the driver to keep 
his eyes on the road at all times.

2.3.2. Functional principle 

The HUD is similar to a projector. A light source is required to project the HUD information. Two white 
LEDs serve as the light source. The light is directed through a lens onto a TFT projection display 
where the screen contents are displayed. The TFT projection display can be compared to a filter which 
admits or blocks light. 

An optical imaging element determines the shape, distance and size of the HUD images. 

The image appears to float freely over the roadway, the windshield acts as a deflecting mirror.

2.3.3. Operating elements and settings 

The HUD is operated and adjusted via the following operating elements: 

• BEFAS on/off button 

• Controller/CID 

• Dimmer wheel in light switch cluster. 

Switching on/off 

The button is resistance coded and is routed directly to the HUD. The resistance coding enables the 
HUD to identify the button signals or a fault in the button. 

Settings 

The HUD settings are displayed in the CID and can be modified via the controller: 

• Call up the main menu by pressing the menu button 

• Call up "Settings" menu item 

• Call up "Head-Up Display" menu item. 

The following settings can be modified: 

• Brightness 

• Height adjustment 

• Displayed information. 

The basic brightness of the Head-Up Display can also be modified via the dimmer wheel in the light 
switch cluster. 

Test functions 

Certain test functions may be also invoked directly on the HUD without using a BMW diagnostic sys¬ 
tem, as follows: 

• Hold the HUD button in the BEFAS pressed for roughly 20 seconds and then release 

• Press the button again to call up additional test functions 

• Hold the HUD button in the BEFAS pressed for longer than 20 seconds to exit this function. 

2.3.4. Installation location 

The head-up display is fitted above the steering column, immediately behind the instrument cluster. It 
is secured to the bulkhead supporting structure using three screws.

2.3.5. Windshield 

The windshield is a "special pane of glass" and an important element in the projection of the displays. 
The outer and inner glass panes are bonded to a plastic film, just like in the standard windshield. Un¬ 
like in the standard windshield, this plastic film is not parallel but is tapered over the entire area of the 
windshield. 

Incorrect windshield installed 

The HUD image is always reflected on the inner surface and outer surface of the windshield. 

With a standard windshield, the two reflected images are offset due to the tilt angle of the window 
glass. 

Due to the taper angle, these two images are superimposed on the HUD window glass with the result 
that the driver only sees "one" image.
