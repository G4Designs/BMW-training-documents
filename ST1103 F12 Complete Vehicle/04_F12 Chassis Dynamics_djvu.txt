3.3. Suspension/dampers 

Both axles of the FI 2 are equipped as standard with steel springs and EDC shock absorbers. 

3.3.1. Electronic Damper Control (EDC) 



F12 Components of EDC 

Dynamic Damper Control is standard and is a sub-function of the Vertical Dynamics Management 
VDM. With EDC, the actuator unit and the specified satellite sensors at the shock absorber are con¬ 
nected to the VDM control unit via FlexRay. The damper characteristics stored in the VDM control unit 
can be selected via the drive dynamic control switch in the center console. 


11 








FI 2 Chassis Dynamics 

3. Chassis and suspension 

The primary objective of the EDC system is to increase ride comfort and maintain a high standard of 
driving safety without compromise. Greater ride comfort is achieved if the vertical movement of the 
vehicle body is virtually eliminated despite excitation of the vehicle due to the roadway (unevenness, 
joints) or cornering. This is why the adjustable dampers are operated using a soft, comfortable damp¬ 
ing characteristic in as many situations as possible. 

A high standard of driving safety is guaranteed if the wheels never lose contact with the roadway and 
deliver a high bearing force when necessary. This is why a harder damping action is set if the driving 
situation or driver intervention (e.g. steering, braking) is required. 

In addition, the EDC control takes steering operations (e.g. transition from straight-ahead driving 
to cornering) into account based on the steering angle characteristic. If the EDC detects a rapid in¬ 
crease in the steering angle, the controller deduces that cornering is starting and can now set a harder 
damper setting at the outer cornering wheels as a preventative measure. The EDC therefore supports 
the ARS control and thus assists in reducing the rolling movement of the vehicle. 

EDC can also detect when the driver is braking based on the information supplied by the DSC on brake 
pressure. A high brake pressure normally causes a pitching movement of the vehicle. EDC counteracts 
this by setting the front damper for higher damping forces. This also improves the braking force distri¬ 
bution at the front/rear which produces a small braking distance advantage (when compared to a vehi¬ 
cle without EDC). 

The basic damping force level is adapted by the EDC controller depending on which damping program 
is selected by the driver (comfort/sport). Irrespective of this, e.g. even if the Comfort program is se¬ 
lected, high damping forces act on individual wheels in critical driving situations. A reference damp¬ 
ing force is output via FlexRay for every wheel or damper according to the prioritization of the individu¬ 
al controller components. In addition, a default current value for the quiescent operating point is speci¬ 
fied for the dampers. 


3.4. Wheels & Tires

3.5. Tire Pressure Monitor System 

3.5.1. System function 

The Tire Pressure Monitor System is installed in the FI 2. 

The direct measuring TPM system (RDC) consists of the TPMS control unit with integrated reception 
aerial and four wheel electronics. It was possible to reduce the number of components and cost of the 
TPM system by integrating the reception antenna in the TPMS control unit. 

The four wheel electronics transmit the tire pressure and temperature to the TPMS control unit via 
radio communication (433 MHz). Once the wheel electronics have been woken up, (vehicle speed > 

20 km/h), a total of 25 telegrams are transmitted once at two second intervals. Providing the pressure 
does not drop, individual telegrams are then sent every 18 seconds from the wheel electronics to the 
TPMS control unit. As a prerequisite for the wheel electronics to go to sleep, the wheel must be at a 
standstill for more than five minutes. 

Resetting the tire pressure values 

The tire pressure values are reset via the instrument panel (KOMBI) or Central Information Display 
(CID). The TPMS text message appears, or the permanent TPMS indicator light lights up, in the instru¬ 
ment panel (KOMBI) when the teach-in process starts. 

Teach-in process 

During the teach-in process, the wheel electronics identification numbers (IDs) are transmitted to the 
TPMS control unit. The TPMS control unit can identify the wheel position of the corresponding wheel 
electronics via the identification numbers once the teach-in process is complete. 

Two acceleration sensors are installed in each of the wheel electronics in order to be able to determine 
their positions. The acceleration sensors determine the wheel's direction of rotation. This means that 
it is possible to differentiate between the positions of the right/left wheel electronics at the vehicle. 

The high frequency signals received are evaluated in order to determine whether the wheel electronics 
are at the front or rear axle. The TPMS control unit with integrated receiver is installed in the luggage 
compartment. The level of the signals received by the TPMS control unit from the wheels on the rear 
axle is higher than the level of signals sent by the wheel electronics on the front axle. This means it is 
possible to determine whether the wheel electronics are at the front or rear of the vehicle. 

The entire teach-in process takes between roughly one and twelve minutes at the most. The following 
factors influence the time it takes to complete the process: 

• The condition of the road (smooth or rough surface) 

• The current mode of the wheel electronics (awake/gone to sleep) 

• The RDC control unit already knows what the IDs of the wheel electronics are.

FI 2 TPMS- teach-in process complete 


Once the teach-in process is complete, the RDC text message or solid TPMS indicator light is can¬ 
celled. Four green tire symbols subsequently appear in the CID. 

Pressure drop 



FI 2 TPMS- pressure drop 

Once the teach-in process is complete, the wheel electronics send the pressure, temperature and also 
the identification numbers of the tires to the TPMS control unit at regular intervals when driving. 

If a pressure change of > 20 kPa (0.2 bar, 2.9 psi) is identified within two successive pressure measure¬ 
ments, the wheel electronics for the relevant wheel immediately assumes a fast transmitting mode. It 
then sends information to the TPMS control unit at one-second intervals. If the tire pressure drops by 
more than 25%, the RDC text message "Tire Low" appears.

3.5.4. Notes for Service 

Teach-in process 

The wheel electronics must be taught in under the following circumstances: 

• The tire pressure has been changed 

• A tire change has been carried out 

• Wheels have been replaced 

The driver can start the teach-in process via the Central Information Display (CID) and the controller. 
For more information, refer to the vehicle owner's manual. 

Service life of batteries for wheel electronics 

The service life of the batteries installed in the wheel electronics is roughly 7.5 years. The current val¬ 
ue of the service life counter in the batteries of the wheel electronics can be read out via the diagnosis 
system. 

If the battery is fully discharged or faulty, a fault message is displayed via the TPMS. 

Removing/installing the wheel electronics 

The following points must be observed when removing/installing the wheel electronics of the Tire 
Pressure Monitor System:

4.1. Service brakes 

The FI 2 has a dual-circuit hydraulic brake system with front/rear split. Lightweight construction brake 
discs with riveted aluminium disc centers sections are installed at the front and rear axle of the FI 2. 
Conventional bracket-type aluminium floating calipers are used on the front axle while cast iron floating 
caliper brakes with integrated EMF actuator (for the Electromechanical Parking Brake) are installed at 
the rear. 

The familiar brake pad wear monitoring function for the Condition Based Service display continues to 
be used. 

The brake discs at the front and rear axle are ventilated internally.

4.2. Electromechanical Parking Brake (EMF) 

An EMF is integrated in the rear brake calipers of the FI 2. 

The use of the electromechanical parking brake offers the following advantages: 

• Operated via an ergonomic button in the center console 

• Safe and reliable application and release of the parking brake under all preconditions 

• Automatic protection of the hydraulic holding functions (automatic hold function) 

• Dynamic emergency braking function ensured by way of the control systems (ABS) even on 
surfaces with a coefficient of friction 

• The discontinuation of the parking brake lever in the center console creates space for new 
equipment features.

ing brake button. The vehicle condition is queried/detected via the electrical system connection and 
the bus systems. The control unit decides whether all conditions for engaging the parking brake are in 
place. If this is the case, the two EMF actuators on the rear brake calipers are activated. 

4.2.4. System function 

Due to the spindle's self-locking facility, the clamping force remains securely applied even when no 
power supply is connected, and the vehicle is thus securely held. Once the required force is reached, 
the parking brake applied status is indicated by a red indicator lamp in the instrument panel (KOMBI) 
and an additional red LED in the parking brake button.

The driver applies the vehicle's parking brake by pulling out the parking brake button. The operating 
direction is the same as for a mechanical parking brake lever. The signal from the parking brake button 
is imported by the EMF control unit. The EMF actuators on the rear brake calipers are individually con¬ 
trolled by the EMF control unit. 

The parking brake can be applied in any logical terminal status. The connection from terminal 30 to 
the EMF control unit makes it possible to apply the parking brake at terminal 0. The EMF control unit 
wakes up if the driver operates the parking brake button at terminal 0. The EMF control unit then 
wakes up the other control units in the vehicle. Only then does the EMF control unit receive the essen¬ 
tial information about vehicle standstill. In addition, the change of parking brake status can also be indi¬ 
cated once the system has woken up. 


28 





















FI 2 Chassis Dynamics 

4. Brakes 

The "applied" status is indicated by a red indicator light in the instrument panel (KOMBI) and an addi¬ 
tional red LED in the parking brake button. Once the parking brake is on, pulling the parking brake but¬ 
ton again has no effect. 



Roll-away detection while parking brake applied 

The roll-away detection function is designed to prevent the vehicle rolling away while the parking brake 
is applied. The roll-away detection function is always activated whenever the parking brake status 
changes from "released" to "applied" and terminates after a defined period of time from that change of 
status. 

A signal from the DSC is used as the input variable for roll-away detection. As soon as that signal in¬ 
dicates that the vehicle is starting to roll during the detection window, the EMF actuators are immedi¬ 
ately further tightened. That is achieved by applying maximum current to the EMF actuators for 100 
ms in order to increase the clamping force. The system then waits for 400 ms. If the vehicle starts to 
roll again, the retightening process is repeated (up to three times). If rolling of the vehicle is still detect¬ 
ed after retightening the parking brake three times, the function terminates and a fault is entered in the 
fault memory. 

Temperature monitoring 

The temperature monitoring function ensures that the loss of parking-brake force that occurs when 
hot brake discs cool down is compensated for. The temperature monitoring function is activated if the 
temperature is above a defined value on a change of parking brake status from "released" to "applied". 

The temperature of the brake discs is calculated individually for each wheel by the DSC control unit 
and communicated to the EMF control unit. When the status changes, the higher of the two brake disc 
temperatures is used for temperature monitoring purposes. The temperature ranges and correspond¬ 
ing retightening periods are stored in a characteristic map. 

The appropriate retightening periods from the characteristic map are applied according to the temper¬ 
ature on change of status. Once the first retightening period has elapsed, the parking brake is retight¬ 
ened for the first time. After expiry of the second retightening period, the parking brake is retightened 
again, and again after the third period has elapsed. The characteristic map may also contain the value 
0 for one or more retightening periods. In that case, the corresponding retightening sequences do not 
take place. The function terminates when the last retightening sequence has been completed. 

Releasing the parking brake 

The parking brake is released by pressing the parking brake button down. However, for the parking 
brake to actually be released, Terminal 15 must be ON and at least one of the following preconditions 
satisfied: 


29 



FI 2 Chassis Dynamics 

4. Brakes 


• Brake pedal applied, or 

• Automatic transmission parking lock engaged, or 

• Clutch pedal depressed (vehicles with manual gearbox only). 

That prevents the vehicle starting to roll when not intended, e.g. if another occupant apart from the 
driver presses the parking brake button. Once the parking brake is released, the red indicator lamp on 
the instrument panel (KOMBI) and the red LED in the parking brake button go out. 

Activation of the EMF actuator sets the spindle in motion. The rotation of the spindle moves the spin¬ 
dle nut a small, defined distance away from the brake piston. 

Dynamic emergency braking 

The law requires that there are two operating facilities for the brakes. The second operating facility 
in the FI 2 after the brake pedal is the parking brake button in the center console. If the parking brake 
button is pulled up while the vehicle is moving, the DSC system performs a dynamic emergency brak¬ 
ing operation in a defined sequence. This function is intended for emergency situations in which the 
driver is not able to brake the vehicle using the brake pedal. Other occupants can also bring the vehicle 
to a standstill in this way if, for example, the driver suddenly falls unconscious. 

During dynamic emergency braking, brake pressure is generated hydraulically at all four wheel brakes. 
The DSC functions are fully active and the brake lights are operated. That represents a fundamental 
advantage over manual parking brakes. 

Dynamic emergency braking only occurs while the parking brake button is being pulled. The level of 
deceleration applied by the DSC is steeply increased. During dynamic emergency braking the EMF in¬ 
dicator light on the instrument panel (KOMBI) is activated. In addition, a Check Control message is dis¬ 
played along with an acoustic signal in order to draw the driver's attention to this special situation. 

If the driver decelerates by pressing the brake pedal and pulling the parking brake button at the same 
time, the DSC control unit priorities and implements the higher braking demand. If dynamic emergen¬ 
cy braking continues until the vehicle is at a standstill, the vehicle remains braked even after the park¬ 
ing brake button is released. The EMF indicator light in the instrument panel (KOMBI) remains on. The 
driver can then release the parking brake (see "Releasing the parking brake"). 

Parking brake fault 

If the parking brake develops a fault, the EMF indicator lamp in the instrument panel (KOMBI) shows 
yellow. A Check Control message is displayed.

4. Brakes 


The parking brake can be released by unscrewing the EMF actuators and manually screwing back the 
spindle. 

Replacing brake pads 

To replace the brake pads the EMF actuator must be in the fully released position so that the brake 
piston can be pressed back. The EMF actuators can be operated by means of the BMW diagnosis sys¬ 
tem and moved to the fully released position. That position is required in order to be able to replace the 
brake pads. Once the installation position is reached, installation mode is automatically activated.

The parking brake cannot be applied while the EMF control unit is in installation mode for safety rea¬ 
sons. If the parking brake button is operated with the EMF control unit in this mode, the EMF indicator 
lamp on the instrument panel (KOMBI) flashes yellow. 


Installation mode can be cancelled in two ways: 

• By executing the service function "Reset installation mode" with the aid of ISTA 

• By driving the vehicle and exceeding a programmed minimum speed.

The precise procedure for bedding-in the service brakes is described in the repair instructions. The in¬ 
structions here must be precisely followed.

FI 2 Chassis Dynamics 

4. Brakes 


Brake test stand detection 

The EMF control unit determines via a plausibility check (comparison of wheel speeds) that the vehi¬ 
cle is on a brake test stand and switches to brake test stand mode. This process takes roughly six sec¬ 
onds. 

Pull the parking brake button several times in a row to approach the following target positions: 

• Brake pads in contact 

• Force level 1 for brake test stand 

• Force level 2 for brake test stand 

• Target force. 

Alternatively, the parking brake button can be continuously held in the pulled-out position while brake 
test stand mode is active. The target positions are then approached one-by-one at three second inter¬ 
vals. 

When brake test stand mode is active and the EMF actuators are released, the parking brake indicator 
light flashes slowly. 

When brake test stand mode is active and the EMF actuators are partially applied, the parking brake in¬ 
dicator light starts to flash more quickly. 

When brake test stand mode is active and the EMF actuators are fully applied, the parking brake indi¬ 
cator light remains permanently lit. 

When the vehicle is on a brake test stand, the parking brake can be released without having to press 
the brake or clutch pedal. Brake test stand mode is automatically cancelled when the vehicle is driv¬ 
en off the brake test stand. It is also deactivated if the parking brake button is pressed in or if a fault is 
present.

Electric Power Steering (EPS) is fitted to the FI 2 as standard. The steering is now entirely electrically 
operated and replaces the conventional hydraulic steering. The Electromechanical power steering with 
parallel-axis arrangement (EPS-APA) familiar from the FI 0 is used. 

Active steering and rear axle slip angle control are available in the Integral Active Steering optional 
equipment package (2VFI).

EPS steering reduces fuel consumption by roughly 0.31 per 100 km when compared to conventional 
hydraulic power steering. This helps reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 

As there is no oil in an EPS, it is environmentally cleaner than conventional hydraulic power steering. 

For reasons inherent in the system, EPS is always equipped with the Servotronic function. Two differ¬ 
ent settings (“Normal” and “Sporty”) can be accessed via the driving dynamic control switch. 

The EPS is less sensitive to external disturbance variables such as shudder and steering wheel vibra¬ 
tion. It also features active roll damping which enhances the driving safety of the FI 2. 

The return characteristics of the EPS are fully configurable. That means that optimum drivability can 
be guaranteed. In addition, the EPS allows implementation of the parking assistance feature.

The operating principle and design of the EPS are identical with those of the FI 0 and are described in

5.2.1. Functional ranges 

The Integral Active Steering further improves driving dynamics through additional control interventions 
at the front and rear axle. The vehicle speed, lateral acceleration and yaw rate calculated from mea¬ 
sured variables are compared with a set-point value. The difference between the set-point and actual 
value is converted into a reference yaw moment. The resulting control interventions are distributed in 
an optimum ratio between the active steering AL or rear axle slip angle control (HSR). 

The EPS is supplemented by a planetary gearbox with override function in the steering gear input and 
an active steering servomotor. The active steering servomotor can modify the steering angle specified 
by the driver with reference to default values from the active steering control unit. 

To do this, the active steering control unit evaluates the sensor signals, which include: 

• Steering angle 

• Wheel speed 

• Yaw rate 

• Lateral acceleration. 

In the event that the system fails, the active steering servomotor is braked and disabled by a lock. The 
full range of vehicle maneuverability is retained as a permanent mechanical connection between the 
steering wheel and the front wheels exists. 

Low speed range 

The variable steering ratio of the active steering component reduces the steering effort required to 
move the front wheels from lock to lock to roughly two steering wheel turns. 

At low speed ranges of up to roughly 60 km/h, the variable steering ratio of the front axle is coupled 
with an opposing steering angle at the rear axle. This increases the maneuverability of the vehicle. 

High speed range 

As the driving speed increases, the degree of steering angle amplification by the Active Steering com¬ 
ponent is reduced and the steering-gear ratio becomes less direct. 

At the same time, the steering strategy adopted by the Integrated Active Steering changes. While at 
low speeds the rear wheels are steered in an opposing direction to the front axle, at higher speeds the 
steering angle is in the same direction. 

As a result the instantaneous center of rotation shifts backwards. This corresponds to a vehicle with a 
longer wheelbase which enhances its directional stability. The radius of the curve becomes longer. 

Active steering adds a further angle to the wheels at the front axle which means that the curve radius 
and required steering angle remain at the accustomed level. 


38 





FI 2 Chassis Dynamics 

5. Steering 

Overall, lane changes and steering maneuvers can be mastered with a greater degree of stability by 
coordinating steering interventions at the front and rear axle - without compromising agility and con¬ 
trol. 

The combination of the active steering with the rear wheel steering gives the driver advantages in all 
speed ranges. 

Stabilization when understeering 

When changing lanes quickly, all vehicles have a tendency to produce a significant yaw response and 
can sometimes start to oversteer. 

If the ICM dynamic handling controller detects a difference between the response desired by the driv¬ 
er and the reaction of the vehicle, it initiates coordinated steering interventions on the front and rear 
wheels. The speed of the stabilizing intervention is such that it is hardly perceptible by the driver. 

Decelerating DSC brake interventions can largely be dispensed with which improves the stability and 
damping of the vehicle.

Owing to the principle of active steering, up till now it was only possible to respond to oversteering ve¬ 
hicle behavior with individual brake modulation of the outside rear wheel by the DSC. 

With the introduction of active rear axle steering, corrective action is now possible in understeering sit¬ 
uations through intervention of the Integral Active Steering which further increases active safety. 

The components of Integral Active Steering "active steering AL" and "rear axle slip angle control HSR" 
cannot be ordered separately and are only available with the Integral Active Steering package (SA

As with the FI 0 higher steering forces are required due to the active steering at the front axle, 12V 
power steering would no longer be sufficient. An EPS with 24 V power supply is therefore used in the 
FI 2 in conjunction with the optional equipment Integral Active Steering (2VH). 

The necessary components, an auxiliary battery with charger and a separator, are installed in the lug¬ 
gage compartment of the FI 2.

It switches the relay in the separator that integrates the auxiliary battery into the circuit. The EPS is on¬ 
ly supplied with 24 V once this relay has been switched. If a fault develops, the EPS can also be oper¬ 
ated using 12 V. If no fault develops, the relay in the separator is switched from terminal 15N.

The auxiliary battery can be charged in 24 V mode using the battery charging unit. The charger draws 
the power required for this from the vehicle electrical system via the Luggage compartment power dis¬ 
tribution box. 

When the Electric Power Steering is in 24 V mode, the auxiliary battery is charged via the charging 
controller for auxiliary battery (BCU). As a voltage of 24 V is present in the EPS circuit due to the series 
connection of the main and auxiliary battery, the auxiliary battery can only be charged using a special 
measure. 

This involves using a DC/DC converter in the charging controller for auxiliary battery (BCU) that pro¬ 
duces different voltages at the input and output that are isolated from one another. 

Energy is drawn from the vehicle electrical system and fed to the auxiliary battery.

The use of Integral Active Steering increases the overall ride comfort and dynamics of the vehicle by 
actively steering the rear wheels in certain conditions. 

The special HSR actuator on the rear axle is fastened underneath a support plate on the rear axle sup¬ 
port. This electromechanical actuator is located between the two camber links of the integral V rear 
axle. The rear wheel steering system includes a dedicated HSR control unit that controls and monitors 
the HSR actuator. 

Control systems were designed independently of one another using the state-of-the-art technology. 

In the FI 2 these systems are networked by the ICM. In the ICM architecture a central control unit has 
superseded the driving dynamics sensors previously used and constitutes a central driving dynamics 
controller.

The HSR actuator is designed for a maximum stroke of ± 8 mm which produces a maximum steering 
lock of ± 3° at the wheel. 

The worm-and-nut rear-wheel steering gear is self-inhibiting. This means that if the system fails, the 
vehicle has the same drivability is a vehicle without rear wheel steering.

6.2. Dynamic Stability Control DSC 

The DSC prevents the driving wheels spinning when pulling away and accelerating. 

In addition, the DSC detects unstable driving conditions such as oversteer or understeer. The DSC 
helps to keep the vehicle on a safe course within the physical limits by reducing engine power output 
and individually modulating the brake intervention at each wheel.

Driving style and safety always remains the responsibility of the driver, do Not rely solely on 
DSC to maintain stability of the vehicle. 

The additional safety features afforded by the system should not be diminished by risky driv¬ 
ing. 


The DSC system and its hydraulic block mounted control unit incorporate a large number of individual 
functions which are listed in the table below.

The FI 2 features the Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM) with integrated Electronic Damper 

Control (EDC) function. The EDC was also referred to as Vertical Dynamics Control (VDC) in the large 
series from the F01/F02 onwards. The VDC introduced with the E70/E71 was systematically devel¬ 
oped further for the F01/F02, FI 0 and now the FI 2 uses the latest version. 

The EDC reduces undesirable vehicle movements that arise as a result of a dynamic driving style or 
uneven roadway. This achieves noticeable improvements in the following areas, even with a com¬ 
fort-oriented sports suspension: 

• Vehicle body comfort 

• Tire comfort 

• Driving dynamics. 

With EDC, the actuator unit and the specified satellite sensors at the shock absorber are connected to 
the VDM control unit via FlexRay. 

The vertical acceleration of the wheel is recorded by the acceleration sensors integrated in the satel¬ 
lite. 

The movement of the vehicle body is determined based on the wheel acceleration and ride height sig¬ 
nals. In addition, signals such as the vehicle speed are acquired via FlexRay and used to determine the 
reference forces for the damping action. 

The current supply required for the rebound and compression stage valves at the dampers is switched 
based on the calculated reference force and the damper characteristic map. 

In the FI 2, the Dynamic Damper control is standard and the optional Active Roll Stabilization (ARS, SA 
229), is available as an option. 


6.4. Active Roll Stabilization ARS (Dynamic Drive) 

The Active Roll Stabilization ARS was introduced for the first time in the E65/E66. With the FI 2, this is 
available as option. (SA 229) 

ARS can bring about a noticeable reduction in the lateral tilt of the body that occurs during fast corner¬ 
ing or avoidance maneuvers. During this process, the ARS reduces the required steering angle and al¬ 
so minimizes the unwanted interference created by the wheels on the axle. 

The ARS significantly improves the bump steer as well as the load change response of the vehicle.

With ARS the following variables are permanently measured or calculated: 

• Vehicle speed 

• Current lateral and longitudinal acceleration 

• Body and wheel acceleration 

• Steering wheel position 

• Ride heights. 

Control commands are sent to the hydraulic swivel motors of the anti-roll bars based on the data ac¬ 
quired in order to counteract the lateral tilting forces that occur.

In the FI 2, the combined effect of all drivetrain and driving stability control systems can also be influ¬ 
enced via the driving dynamic control switch. The operating principle is the same as the F01. In addi¬ 
tion to the three different modes of the DSC available through the DSC button, four different modes 
are available through the driving dynamics switch. 

The Sports mode can be configured with through the iDrive Controller. 

Sports mode configuration 

The “Sport” mode allows the driver to personalize the individual settings with regard to drivetrain, 
chassis and suspension or both.
