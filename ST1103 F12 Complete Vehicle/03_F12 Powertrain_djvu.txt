2.1. N63 engine 



N63 engine 


First introduced with the X6, the N63 engine is the successor to the N62 engine. It is the first engine 
worldwide to feature an optimized package for integration of the turbochargers and main catalytic con¬ 
verters within the engine valley. The location of the turbochargers and catalytic converters (in the “v” 
space between the banks) means the locations of the intake and exhaust ports have been reversed. In 
addition, the resulting short pipe lengths and large cross-sections minimize the pressure losses on the 
intake and exhaust ports. 

Special features: 

• Implementation in all model series (E71/E72, F01/F02, F04, F07/, F10) 

• Twin exhaust turbochargers in the engine valley 

• Catalytic converters are also mounted in the engine valley 

• High Precision Direct fuel injection with piezoelectric injectors 

• MSD85 engine control, liquid-cooled and FlexRay capable 

• Indirect charge air cooling

2.2.2. Engine identification 

The engines have an identification mark on the crankcase to ensure unambiguous identification and 
classification. 

This engine identification is also necessary for approval by government authorities. With the N55 en¬ 
gine, this identification has been subject to a further development, with the previous eight positions 
being reduced to seven. The engine number can be found on the engine below the engine identifi¬ 
cation. This consecutive number, in conjunction with the engine identification, permits unambiguous 
identification of each individual engine.

3.1. Designation 

A unique designation is used for the transmission in the technical documentation so it can be clearly 
identified. In frequent cases, however, only a short designation is used. This short form is used so the 
transmission can be assigned to a transmission family. The GA8HP transmission family, consisting of 
the GA8HP45Z, GA8HP70Z and GA8HP90Z transmissions for example, is often mentioned.

3.3. GA8HP transmission 

The new GA8HP45Z and GA8HP70Z automatic transmissions with eight forward gears and one re¬ 
verse gear are used in the FI 2.

FI 2 Powertrain 
3. Automatic transmission 



Special features: 

• Enhanced gearshift spontaneity 

• Greater driving and shifting comfort as a result of a closer gear ratio 

• Higher precision control of the converter lockup clutch at low engine loads 

• High power transmission of the converter lockup clutch 

• Reduced fuel consumption (-5% to -6%) 

The GA8HP45Z and GA8HP70Z are new developments and will gradually replace the established 6- 
speed automatic transmissions GA6HP19Z TU and GA6HP26Z TU. The overall gear ratio has been 
increased from 6.04 to 7.07; the gear to gear ratios have are now closer, thus also reducing the differ¬ 
ences in speed when shifting gear. The weight of the transmission has been reduced significantly us¬ 
ing a plastic oil pan and other lightweight components. 

The Electronic Transmission Control (EGS) control unit is integrated in the control unit framework of 
the electronic immobilizer EWS. This provides better protection against theft. 

It is operated via the gear selector switch or using the shift paddles (SA 2TB, automatic sports trans¬ 
mission, via the steering column switch cluster (SZL)). 

Mechanical torsional vibration dampers of the second generation are deployed in the torque converter: 


Turbine torsional vibration damper TTD 

Two-damper torque converter ZDW. (used on diesel applications of this transmission)

FI 2 Powertrain 
3. Automatic transmission 


The function and structure of the torque converter are described in the “E70 Automatic transmission” 
training material available on TIS and ICR 

The vibration isolation reduces the proportion of slip on the converter lockup clutch and enables a 
larger operating range with the converter lockup clutch closed. This reduces the fuel consumption by 
5% to 6% in the consumption cycle (KV01) compared to the TU 6-speed automatic transmission used 
until now.

3.4.2. Electronic transmission emergency release 

A 

Only specially trained service technicians are permitted to actuate electronic transmission emergency 
release. 

The vehicle must not be towed while electronic transmission emergency release is actuated; it may 
only be maneuvered. In case of misuse an entry is made in the fault memory. 


A _ _ 

The electronic transmission emergency release can only be operated if the engine does not start but 
the starter motor still turns. 

The electronic transmission emergency release function is active for fifteen minutes. This time is ex¬ 
tended by a further 15 minutes as soon as a wheel speed signal is recorded. After this time period the 
parking lock is engaged without a Check Control message being displayed. The time specified is de¬ 
pendent on the battery capacity. 


Before operating the electronic transmission emergency release, secure the vehicle to prevent 
it from rolling

4.3. G manual transmission 

The G manual transmission familiar from the E60 with N62 engine has been further developed for used 
in the FI 2 650i with N63 engine. The maximum drive torque has been increased from 490 Nm to 600 
Nm.

FI 2 Powertrain 
4. Manual transmission 


This means that an extremely high degree of precision, operational smoothness and top class shift¬ 
ing comfort are tangible to the customer. The total ratio spread of the transmission maximizes the uti¬ 
lization of engine performance. The shifting comfort is significantly higher, due in part to the short shift 
travel distances of 55 mm. 

Special features: 

• Slip suppression control system to prevent clutch slip 

• Start-up engine speed limitation in order to minimize the work required to overcome friction of 
the clutch (in conjunction with the N63 engine) 

• External transmission oil cooling (in conjunction with the N63 engine) 

• Use of long term oil filling. 

A slip suppression control system is installed to prevent possible overloading of the clutch. This makes 
acceleration under full load conditions possible without the clutch slipping. The clutch slip is calculat¬ 
ed via an engine speed pickup at the transmission countershaft and the engine torque is reduced as 
required. 

A start-up engine speed limitation system is used in conjunction with the N63 engine. This limits the 
engine speed to 3500 - 5500 rpm when the vehicle is at a standstill, depending on the mode of the 
Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), which prevents thermal overloading of the drive plate during the 
starting process. 

In conjunction with the N63 engine, the external transmission oil cooling system ensures that the ve¬ 
hicle operates reliably, even under extreme conditions. To achieve this, the transmission oil is pumped 
through the transmission oil cooler by a transmission oil pump to cool it. The transmission has an inte¬ 
grated gearbox oil temperature sensor via which the transmission oil pump is switched on (transmis¬ 
sion oil temperature >130 °C) or off (transmission oil temperature <110 °C).

6. Driveshafts 

6.1. Driveshaft 

6.1.1. Overview 

Two variants of the steel driveshaft are used depending engine-transmission configuration. 

Special focal points of the FI 2 driveshaft design were the torque transfer and comfort requirements in 
relation to acoustics and vibrations. 

The joints, shaft divisions and shaft diameters have been designed to prevent disruptive noises or vi¬ 
brations being passed on through the connection points to the body. 

The FI 2 driveshafts are connected to the manual or automatic transmission and to the rear axle final 
drive exclusively using flexible discs. This minimizes the high-frequency gear meshing noises on the 
rear axle final drive.

6.1.2. Crash function 

In the event of a head-on collision, the driveshaft absorbs a portion of the crash energy. The properties 
of the so-called crash function, which is integrated in the front driveshaft tube, have been optimized. 
The force at which the front driveshaft tube selectively deforms has been reduced once again com¬ 
pared to the E63. The torque transfer capability has remained unchanged.

6. Driveshafts 


The FI 2 features output shafts that are inserted onto the gear and differential side. 

The journal version towards the rear axle final drive depends on the size of the rear axle final drive. The 
journal to the wheel hub is designed in only one size. 

The positioning of the rear axle final drive means the left and right output shafts have different overall 
lengths. 

The splined shaft between the two joints is designed as a torsionally-rigid hollow shaft.
