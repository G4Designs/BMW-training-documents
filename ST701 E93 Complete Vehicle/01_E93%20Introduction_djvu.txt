E93 Introduction 


The 3 Series Convertible 



With the 3 Series Convertible, customers have always enjoyed the exhilarating feeling of 
driving with the top down. 

The E93 consistently continues this line while adopting the sporty characteristics of the 
E92. This sport-orientated performance is reflected in the deep-drawn front and the 
wide, flat rear. 

New engines, an even more rigid body with 19 Hz torsion frequency (torsional rigidity) 
and a sophisticated strut, chassis and suspension concept support the sports character. 

Dimensions and Weight 

In terms of dimensions, the E93 is larger compared to the E46/C. The E93 is 4580 mm 
long, 1782 mm wide and 1384 mm high.The weight has also increased from 1565 kg 
(E46)to 1655 kg (E93). 





E93 Introduction 

















Bodyshell 


By using high-strength materials, the philosophy of lightweight body construction has 
been consistently realized in the E93.

E93 Introduction 






































Higher dynamic forces are introduced into the body structure while driving due to the 
runflat tires and harder suspension setup in the E93 compared to the E46/C. 
Consequently, the rigidity targets have been raised even further compared to the E46/C.

The sill represents the decisive load path from the front end to the rear end. A horizontal 
flange is used between the inner and outer sill shell in orderto optimally utilize the 
available package space for bending and torsional rigidity. The sill is reinforced with trans¬ 
verse bulkheads. 

To effectively absorb stress and strain, the outer skin panel of the sill is designed as a 
flexibly rolled sheet metal component with wall thickness varying between 2.00 mm and 
3.00 mm. The greatest wall thickness is at the nodes forthe A and B-pillars. 

With minimum weight, the partition is an assembled module that provides a large, 
customer-friendly load space. Also in this area, the main load paths run via struts.

E93 Introduction 




Strut Concept 

A strut concept is employed with the aim of increasing the body rigidity, consisting of: 

• Front end struts 

• Spring strut tower - bulkhead - struts 

• Front axle subframe - struts 

• Tension struts at rear 

• Strut in rollover protection system 

The cross section ofthe sill has been additionally increased compared to the E92.

Aerodynamics 

The outstanding aerodynamic qualities ofthe 3 Series Coupe have been transferred to 
the 3 Series Convertible. Ultimately, a drag coefficient cx = 0.29 was realized on the 
325i. 

J oint Reduction 

The size ofthe joint gaps has been reduced on the E93.

E93 Introduction 























Side Panel 

The side panel of the E93 is made from thermoplastic material. It is common part from 
the E92. 

The advantage of a plastic side panel is the weight reduction of approximately 3 kg 
compared to a side panel made from steel. 

Minor bumps are absorbed. 

Doors 

From a workshop point of view, the doors of the E93 are the same as the doors of the 
E92. All assembly and installation work corresponds to that of the E92. 

The doors of the E93 are also based on a lightweight steel construction. The anti-corro¬ 
sion concept with a 2C PVC seal is the same as on the E92.

Important Body Equipment 

• Retractable three-piece hardtop (see reference material "Retractable hardtop E93") 

• Folding rear seat backrest with storage compartment 

• Concealed antennas 

• Easy-load luggage compartment 

• Wind deflector with new functionality 

• Multifunctional ski bag with largerthrough-load width (380 mm instead of 250 mm) 

Partition Module 

The partition module consists ofthe aluminum cross member section with nodes and 
corresponding struts as well as the rollover protection system. 

The partition module additionally contains the control units forthe Convertible top 
module (CTM), park distance control (PDC), Passive Go and rollover control (ROC).

E93 Introduction 



Seats 


A special feature of the front seats in the E93 is the seat-integrated seat belt system. 
This system is known from the E46 and E64. A new feature of the leathertrim finish is 
so-called cool leather, i.e. sun reflective technology. 

This technology involves a change in physical properties by introducing modified color 
pigments in the leather, thus achieving a clearly noticeable temperature difference of up 
to 20°C (on black leather). 

The folding rear seat backrest is a new development in the E93. 



Ski Bag 

The considerably larger ski bag provides the option of storing skis, snowboards as well as 
a golf bag. 

The volume of the luggage compartment is 350 liters and 210 liters with the top down. 
The front cover of the ski bag is hinged such that it can be opened even when the 
backrest is in the upright position. In this position, a restricted through-load opening can 
be used while simultaneously carrying four persons. 


The full cross section of the through-load area can be used when the backrest is folded 
down. The front cover can be detached by means of an adapter system so as to increase 
the loading cross section even further.

E93 Introduction 









Rear Bag 

The rear bag has been specially developed forthe E93 forthe purpose of transporting 
items of luggage, clothing and other items in a clean and dry condition and to protect 
them from nosy-parkers when the top is down. 

The bag is fixed to the vehicle so that it and the contents remain secure even during 
sudden braking. It fits conveniently under the wind deflector. 

Accident Repairs 

The following procedures must be complied with in the event of accident damage in the 
vicinity of the retractable hardtop: 

Accident Damage: Replacing boot lid 

Procedure - Check kinematic rear end module, support tube and coupling locks and main 
mount of roof module, including Convertible top compartment lid for damage and replace 
as required. 

Accident Damage: Replacing rear apron 

Procedure - Remove and install rear end module for retractable hardtop to perform weld¬ 
ing jobs (accessibility of welding tong at weld). 

Check both main mounts, support tube and coupling locks when removed fordamage 
and replace as required. 

Accident Damage: Replacing rear left or right frame side member 

Procedure - Remove and install rear end module for retractable hardtop to perform weld¬ 
ing jobs (accessibility of welding tong at weld). 

Check both main mounts, support tube and coupling locks when removed fordamage 
and replace as required.
