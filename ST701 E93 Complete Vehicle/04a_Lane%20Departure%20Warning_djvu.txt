Lane Departure Warning 





Introduction 


The lane departure warning is available to orderfrom 03/07 as option 5AD forthe E60 
and E61.The feature will be introduced in 09/07 on the E63 and E64. 

Fatigue or inattentiveness on the road can cause a driverto unintentionally leave a lane. 
This could result in the vehicle driving into a lane with oncoming traffic or ditches at the 
side of the road. 

BMW's lane departure warning is a driver assistance system designed to inform the dri¬ 
ver in good time of unintentional course deviations by means of vibrations in the steering 
wheel intended to prompt the driverto make corrective steering movements. 

The lane departure warning is a driver assistance system. The area in front of the vehicle 
is captured by a camera. This makes it possible forthe roadway markings to the right and 
left of the current lane to be detected. 

If the vehicle approaches a roadway marking in the absence of a turn indication, the dri¬ 
ver is informed of the course deviation by steering wheel vibrations before the vehicle 
crosses the line. 

The camera is fitted near the rear-view mirror behind the windscreen and its camera 
images to the control unit on a data line. 

The control unit contains the software that determines the position of the vehicle in the 
lane from the camera images. 

The lane departure warning is designed for operation on highways, major roads and well 
maintained country roads. A warning is issued if the system (current driving conditions 
within a specific time frame being equal) detects that the vehicle is crossing the roadside 
border line. The warning can be felt as a vibrating of the steering wheel. 

The lane departure warning is switched on and off using a button on the steering wheel. 
When the ignition is switched on, the lane departure warning system always reverts to 
the state that was active when the vehicle was last switched off (last function mode). 

The display indicating whether the lane departure warning is switched on or off is output 
by the instrument cluster or, optionally, by the head-up display. When the lane departure 
warning is switched on, there is an additional display indicating whetherthe system is 
primed or not. 

Note: The system is only primed if it is switched on and has detected one or 
two roadside borderlines with the vehicle travelling at a speed faster 
than 70 km/h.

Lane departure warning system overview The lane departure warning system receives a 
number of input signals. The image data of camera (1) is evaluated in lane departure 
warning control unit (2) together with the other vehicle data that the control unit receives 
on the PT-CAN.The lane departure warning is realized from the combination of this data. 

Instrument cluster (9) and head-up display (9) output the displays of the lane departure 
warning. 

Electric motor (3) in multi-function steering wheel (4) produces the vibration of the steer¬ 
ing wheel by means of an imbalance mass. 

Body gateway module (10) transfers the PT-CAN messages from the lane departure 
warning control unit to the K-CAN and vice versa.

Lane Detection 

The camera is fitted to the windscreen near the rear-view mirror. The camera captures the 
roadway up to approximately 40m to the front of the vehicle and up to approximately 5 m 
to the right and left. 

Using image processing technology, the lane departure warning control unit looks for 
possible lane markings in the images captured by the camera. 

The software in the control unit also checks which lane markings are delimiting the 
current lane in which the vehicle is driving. 

From the detected lane markings, the lane departure warning is then calculated for 
the vehicle.

21 

Lane Departure Warning 













Availability of the Lane Departure Warning 


The system is available when: 

• No system fault is present. 

• The lane departure warning system is calibrated correctly. 

• The vehicle speed is above the activation threshold (see following table). 

• At least one roadway marking has been detected by the system with sufficient 
certainty. 

• The vehicle is not in a construction site area with several possible roadway markings. 

• The vehicle is on a road with an average lane width of more than 2.5 m. 

The speed threshold above which the lane departure warning can be available has been 
adapted to country-specific conditions. In the US the activation threshold is 45 mph and 
deactivation threshold is 42 mph. 

Warning Output 

The lane departure warning function only outputs a warning to the driver if the system is 
switched on and available. 

Warning Point 

The system outputs the warning to the driver if the driver approaches a detected roadway 
marking. To do so, the system calculates the anticipated time (t) before the roadway 
marking is crossed.The warning is output in time before the vehicle crosses the marking. 

Since warning situations may arise more frequently on narrow roads, the warning is out¬ 



put later by tendency on these kinds of road

Warning Duration 

The warning ends when: 

• The driver steers back into the lane. 

• A lane change is completed. 

• The vehicle drives on the line for longer than 2.5 s. 

• The turn signal is operated. 

• The brake pedal is depressed with force (brake-pressure-dependent). 

Note: A warning is output only once on approach to a roadway marking. The 
warning lasts no more than 2.5 s. If the vehicle remains on the line, no 
new warning will be issued. A new warning can only be issued if the vehi¬ 
cle has been steered back into the lane orthe vehicle has completed a 
change of lane. 

Suppression of the Warning 

A warning is suppressed despite the display of primed status if the following conditions 

exist on one side: 

• Turn signal operated before the vehicle is driven towards the warning trigger. 

• One-touch turn signal indicated on the side from which a warning would be 
triggered. 

There is no warning suppression if the hazard warning flashers are switched on.

Lane Departure Warning Control Unit 


The control unit is accommodated in a 2/3 shell-type housing. For EMC reasons, 
the housing is made entirely of aluminum. It has two connectors: 

• 12-pin connection to the vehicle electrical system 

• 10-pin connection to the LVDS line. 



Index 

Explanation

LVDS Connection 

2 

Vehicle Electrical System Connection 


The control unit has two processors. One processor is for communicating with the vehi¬ 
cle electrical system on the PT-CAN.The second processor is used to calculate the lane 
departure warning. 

The communication processor is activated as soon as terminal 30g is ON. Messages can 
now be sent and processed on the PT-CAN. The control unit itself is still in sleep mode. 

From terminal 15 ON, the control unit reports to the vehicle electrical system on a cyclical 
basis. The control unit only becomes operational once the Engine running signal is pre- 
sent.This is because it is only at this point that the high-performance computer, whose 
responsibilities include image processing, is activated. 

The high-performance computer evaluates the image data of the camera together with 
the other vehicle data that the control unit receives on the PT-CAN.The lane departure 
warning is realized from the combination of this data. 

During operation of the wipe/wash system, the sweep of the wiper blades also takes them 
through the field of view of the lane departure warning's camera. Forthis reason, the con¬ 
trol unit for the lane departure warning receives information about whether the wipe/wash 
system is switched on or off. 


26 

Lane Departure Warning 









Installation Location 

The control unit is secured by a bracket to the support tube above the glove compart¬ 
ment. 

Overvoltage/Undervoltage Behavior 

The voltage range in which the control unit operates is 9.0 V to 16.0 V. 

Wake-up 

The control unit for the lane departure warning is woken by the wake-up signal of the 
control units on the PT-CAN. 

Sleep Mode 

In sleep mode, the control unit is switched off. 


27 

Lane Departure Warning 



Lane Departure Warning Camera 

The camera is fitted behind the windscreen at the base of the rear-view mirror. The cam¬ 
era for the lane departure warning captures the surrounding area, and therefore the lane 
markings, to the front of the vehicle. 

The camera's scope of detection ranges from approximately 4 m to 40 m ahead of the 
vehicle. The camera has a horizontal aperture angle of approximately 50°, and a vertical 
aperture angle of approximately 30°. 



Detection range of the lane departure warning camera using the E60 as an example 

The camera is a digital black/white CMOS camera. This means that the captured sur¬ 
roundings are output as a grayscale image. 

Colored or Black Roadway Marking 

Roadway markings Colored yellow, blue, red or black are also represented in grayscale. 
The grayscale image may stand out poorly, or not at all, from the grey road surface. 

In unfavorable situations, this could mean that these lanes cannot be detected. 

Note: If no lane is detected, the lane departure warning does not display 
primed status.

Camera Objective 

The camera objective has several glass lenses. They are coated to diminish or even fully 
eliminate scattered light and thereby increase the image quality of the camera. 

Vibration Motor 


The vibration motor and its electronics are fully integrated inside the steering wheel. 

The vibration motor is fitted in the six o'clock spoke of the steering wheel. 

To generate the vibration, there is a small imbalance mass on the shaft of the vibration 
motor. The vibration motor is controlled directly by the control unit. The electronics in the 
steering wheel are used to convert the control voltage supplied by the control unit into 
the voltage value required by the motor and to provide its stabilization. The control voltage 
corresponds to the on-board voltage. 


The motor with imbalance mass issues a warning if the vehicle threatens to leave the 
current lane by causing the steering wheel to vibrate.

Windscreen 

The lane departure warning requires a windscreen matched to the system.The wind¬ 
screen has a wider, black print that conceals the camera and a camera holder bonded on. 

Button 

The SZL records the requests input at the button and sends them to the lane departure 
warning control unit on the PT-CAN. 

Other Control Units 


Steering Column Switch Cluster 

The vibration motor in the steering wheel is connected directly to the lane departure 
warning control unit by the SZL and the slip ring. 

All steering wheels equipped with steering wheel heating LHZ require an SZL with steer¬ 
ing wheel heating.These SZLs are compatible with the lane departure warning. 

For steering wheels without LHZ, there is a special variant of the steering column switch 
clusterforthe lane departure warning. 


Car Access System 

The CAS control unit controls the wake-up line and thus also the waking of the control 
unitforthe lane departure warning. 


Instrument C luster/Head-up Display 

The instrument cluster and the head-up display display the activation status when the 
lane departure warning is switched on. 



Note: The message indicating availability of the lane departure 
warning is only displayed in the instrument cluster. 


A corresponding Check Control message is displayed in the event of a fault anywhere in 
the lane departure warning system. 

Body Gateway Module 

The body gateway module transfers messages from the lane departure warning control 
unit (PT-CAN) to the K-CAN.The same applies in the opposite direction.

Service Information 


Calibration 

If the system is to be able to calculate the distance to a given roadway marking, it must 
know the exact installation position of the camera on the one hand, and the camera's 
exact focal direction on the other. 

Due to installation tolerances and tolerances inside the camera, the position of the cam¬ 
era's viewing angle may vary by several degrees. 

The exact installation position of the camera and its installation angle are determined 
during calibration of the system and stored in the system. 

In production, there is a dedicated calibration bench for this process that determines the 
measured variables by means of sample boards, which are arranged in a defined posi¬ 
tion relative to the vehicle. 

Any replacement of the camera or windscreen requires a calibration of the system 
because the position of the camera and thus of the system sensor may have changed. 

No calibration is required if the control unit is replaced. In this case, the calibration data 
stored in the camera is transferred to the control unit and stored there. 

Each time the system is started, a check takes place to determine whether the system is 
calibrated and whether the system components are matched to each other and the vehi¬ 
cle. In this regard, the Vehicle Identification Number VIN stored in the control unit is com¬ 
pared with that of the vehicle's. 

With this plausibility check, it can be determined whether the control unit is coded cor¬ 
rectly and whether it belongs to the vehicle. 

The VIN stored in the camera is then compared with the VIN stored in the control unit. If 
discrepancies are detected, the system detects that a camera requiring new calibration 
has been fitted and it outputs a corresponding fault code. For more details, please refer 
to the BMW diagnostic system or the repair instructions. 

Note: A windscreen replacement cannot be detected by the system. In this 
case, the aftersales service organization is responsible for ensuring 
that the system is newly calibrated. 


33 

Lane Departure Warning 




To have the system calibrated in the aftersales service organization, a diagnostics job is 
started. This diagnostics job investigates whether the camera is functional and has free 
line of sight. This is determined from the detection of movements in front of the camera. 
Free line of sight can be determined by having someone walk by in front of the camera, 
for example. 

Calibration starts automatically on successful completion of this test step (good camera 
image). Calibration takes place during a calibration run, which can be carried out by the 
customer. In the event that the camera test failed, the calibration process is terminated 
and must be restarted afterthe possible interfering factors have been remedied. 

A specially developed algorithm is used for calibrating the system during the calibration 
run. This algorithm scans the image for all straightedges and, from their orientation, 
determines the viewing angle of the camera. 

The calibration algorithm works from a speed of 30 km/h. Forevaluation purposes, it 
essentially uses images captured during straight-ahead travel. As soon as enough infor¬ 
mation has been recorded, the viewing angle is calculated and stored in the control unit. 

This process generally takes a few minutes. In conditions of poor visibility, e.g. night, rain 
or winding roads, the calibration process may take up to 20 minutes. 

The calibration run does not have to be completed during the first drive following the start 
of the diagnostics job. It is reset with each power cycle and restarted again until it has 
been successfully completed. 

The system can be switched on and off during the calibration process. When the lane 
departure warning has been calibrated, the primed status display is shown when the lane 
departure warning is on.The conditions forthis are: 

• speed of over 70 km/h 

• lane markings detected. 

Following a replacement, e.g. of the control unit, the camera orthe windscreen, it is nec¬ 
essary to recalibrate the lane departure warning. 

The customer is notified by a Check Control message if the calibration process cannot 
be completed successfully after a net time of 7 minutes of straight-ahead travel at over 
60 km/h. 

The system then makes an automatic attempt to carry out calibration again. If this 
attempt underthe conditions described above is unsuccessful, the system makes anoth¬ 
er attempt at calibration. A new Check Control message is only ever output after a power 
cycle following the first unsuccessful calibration attempt. 


34 

Lane Departure Warning 



This process repeats itself until calibration has been successfully completed. If the cali¬ 
bration run does not complete successfully, the vehicle must be brought into the after¬ 
sales service organization. In the after-sales service organization, the calibration process 
can be terminated manually using a diagnostics job. 

After the calibration process has been terminated, it must then be restarted once more. 

Diagnosis 

The control unit for the lane departure warning is compatible with diagnostics. The fault 
code memory can be read using the BMW diagnostic system. 

For test purposes, there is an option for controlling the vibration motor orthe camera, for 
example. You will find more detailed information in the BMW diagnostic system.
