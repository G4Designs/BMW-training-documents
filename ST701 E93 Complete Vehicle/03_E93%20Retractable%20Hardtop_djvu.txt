E93 Retractable Hardtop 




Introduction 


Spring 2007 will see the market launch of the new BMW 3 Series E93 Convertible. It is 
the first to offer a retractable hardtop in lightweight steel construction. The three-part 
roof design with a fully automatic opening and closing mechanism allows the roof to be 
opened or closed in less than 25 seconds. 

The retractable hardtop ofthe new BMW 3 Series Convertible provides good rear visibili¬ 
ty, even when closed. The glass surface area ofthe rear window is significantly larger 
than that ofthe predecessor model. This makes driving maneuvers such as changing 
lanes, turning or parking considerably more pleasant. 

Other advantages ofthe retractable hardtop are: 

• Greater preservation of value 

• Improved protection against damage and theft 

• Optimized year-round suitability 

• Sound insulation performance at high speeds (up to 270 km/h, 167mph) 
compared to that of a Coupe. 

In addition, the folding height ofthe retractable hardtop (about 170cm/67in) is low 
enough to allow it to be opened and closed in garages. 

The three steel roof section plates are engineered for optimum weight and rigidity. 

The trunk lid is also made of steel for rigidity reasons. 

The movement sequence ofthe retractable hardtop is driven by a central hydraulic sys¬ 
tem with 8 hydraulic cylinders. The movement sequence is also supported by 6 gas 
pressure dampers. The hydraulic system is controlled via the Convertible Top Module 
(CTM)and is built into a recess in the luggage compartment floor. 



5 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 













A central electric motor in the front roof panel locks the entire retractable hardtop system 
It is locked at the cowl panel and the center roof panel by means of a linkage mechanism 
The roof panels are interlocked using drive cables (similar to a sunroof drive) orflexible 
thrust cables. 

The trunk lid is locked using the Soft Close Automatic (SCA) feature, which comes stan¬ 
dard. 

The retractable hardtop is opened and closed using the button in the middle of the cen¬ 
ter console. The retractable hardtop can also be opened using the remote control.The 
luggage compartment divider must be closed before the opening and closing process 
can be started. 

The retractable hardtop can be stopped in any position during the opening/closing 
sequence. Pressing the operating button or remote control again continues the opening 
or closing process. 

The retractable hardtop cannot be opened or closed while driving. 

Weight: 

• Roof module: about 98kg or 2161b (approx. 43kg or 951b. more than soft top) 

• Rear module: about 48 kg 

• Complete scope of delivery with trunk lid attachments (lights, SCA etc.) approx. 
147kg or 3241b

Button 


The standard means of operating the retractable hardtop is by actuating the button in 
the center console. The movement of the hardtop is carried out as long as the button is 
actuated.The operating principle ofthe button is similarto that of the powerwindows. 

• Pushing the button opens the hardtop; pulling the button closes it. 

• The green LED in the button lights up while the hardtop is moving. 

• If the button is released while the hardtop is moving, (the movement ofthe hardtop, 
the rear module or the side windows is immediately interrupted).The red LED then 
flashes in the button. The hardtop movement can be resumed by pressing the but¬ 
ton again. The movement ofthe side windows can be resumed within 10 seconds. 

• If one ofthe conditions is not met, the red LED is lit continuously. 


Note: On early production E93 vehicles, the switch operation is different, 
Pushing the button closes the hardtop; pulling the button opens it. 


12 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 















Opening Sequence 

When the button in the center console is 
pushed, the conditions for opening the hard¬ 
top are checked by the Convertible Top 
Module (CTM). Afterthe check is successful¬ 
ly completed, the green LED on the switch 
goes on: 

• The side windows are lowered. 

• Then, the front roof panel is lowered and 
the roof sections are unlocked from each 
other. 

• When the hydraulic system is activated, 
the lock fastener Mechanism "closure”, 
connecting the rear roof section and rear 
module to the body) is unlocked. 

• The 3 roof sections are now positioned 
one on top of each other to form the 
"roof package" 

• Then, the "rear module" is opened and 
the roof package is stowed in the trunk. 



• The stowed roof module is then locked 
in place. 

• The rear module is then closed and 
locked. 

• Finally, the side windows move back up.

Closing Sequence 

The closing procedure of the hardtop is the reverse of the opening. When the button in 
the center console is pulled, the conditions for closing the hardtop are checked by the 
Convertible Top Module (CTM). Afterthe check is successfully completed, the green 
LED lights up and: 

• The side windows are lowered if necessary. 

• The rear module is then unlocked and opened. Simultaneously, the roof package is 
unlocked. 

• Once the rear module is opened all the way, it is held in this position while the roof 
package is extended. 

• When the roof package has reached the end position, the rear module is closed, 
locked by the "closure", (to align all parts in closed position) then unlocked again. 

• The roof sections are then moved apart until the front roof panel reaches the top of 
the cowl panel. 

• The roof sections can now be interlocked as the front roof panel is locked to the 
cowl panel. 

• Finally, the rear roof panel and rear module are locked to the body. 

• The green LED in the button goes out. 

• If the button remains pressed, the side windows are raised. 

Convenience Functions 

The retractable hardtop can also be operated using the remote control or using the 
mechanical key and door lock. For vehicles with the Comfort Access, the hardtop can be 
opened and closed using the ID sensor. 



14 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 



The hardtop is opened by pressing and 
holding down the button on the remote 
control/ID Transmitter for unlocking the vehi¬ 
cle. If, during the opening process, a button 
of the second remote control/ID Transmitter 
is pressed, the opening process is immedi¬ 
ately interrupted. 



Convenience Opening Via Remote/ID Transmitter 

The same pre-conditions apply for conve¬ 
nience opening of the hardtop using the 
remote control/ID Transmitter as for stan¬ 
dard operation. The only difference is that 
terminal R does not need to be enabled 
and that the remote control/l D transmitter is 
within the reception range of the vehicle 
(4m or 13 ft) 


The same pre-conditions apply for conve¬ 
nience closing of the hardtop using remote 
control/ID Transmitter as for standard opera¬ 
tion. 

The ID Transmitter must be within the 
reception range of the Comfort Access 
antenna (4m or 13ft).The hardtop is closed 
by pressing and holding down the button on 
the remote control/ID transmitterfor locking 
the vehicle. If, during the closing operation, a 
button of the second remote control/ID 
Transmitter is pressed, the closing operation 
is immediately interrupted. If the ID 
Transmitter is in the slot, convenience clos¬ 
ing is not possible. 



Convenience C losing Via Remote/ID Ttransmitter 

Convenience closing of the hardtop via ID 
Transmitter is possible for vehicles with the 
Comfort Access. 


Note: Convenience closing using the remote control is 
not possible on vehicles with out Comfort Access 


15 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 


Convenience Functions Via Door Lock 

The hardtop can also be opened and closed using the mechanical key. During the open¬ 
ing or closing process, the vehicle user has all movements and hazardous situations in his 
orherfield ofvision.To do so, the mechanical key in the lock cylinder of the driver's door 
must be turned and held in the "unlock vehicle" or "lock vehicle" direction.

Note: Forvehicles with the Comfort Access, convenience closing 
via the outer door handle electronics is not possible 


16 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 



Convenience Loading/Unloading 

The new convenience loading and unloading function allows quick access to the luggage 
compartment when the roof is open in order to load large items of luggage. The same 
pre-conditions apply for convenience loading and unloading as for operation via remote 
controI/ID Transmitter. 

The convenience loading and unloading function is activated as follows: 


• Briefly press the trunk lid button. 


• Then, press and hold down the 
trunk lid button (no more than one 
second may pass between when the 
trunk lid button is released and 
when it is pressed again)

17 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 




• First, the rear module is unlocked and opened all the way. 

• Then, the roof pack is lifted from the luggage compartment to the 
intermediate position. 

• Next, the rear module is closed and locked. 

• Finally, the trunk lid is unlocked using the Soft Close Automatic 
feature and opened slightly. 

• The luggage compartment divider can be pivoted upward manually. This enlarges 
the access to the luggage compartment so that it can be loaded conveniently with¬ 
out the need to close the hardtop all the way. 

• Afterthe luggage compartment is loaded, the hardtop can be opened using the 
remote control or opened or closed using the ID Transmitter (for vehicles with 
Comfort Access ). 

Note: "Open roof", "Close roof" and "Convenience loading" via remote con- 
trol/ID Transmitter are only possible with Comfort Access Option. 

Soft Close Automatic (SC A) 

For convenient closing of the trunk lid, the Soft Close Automatic is installed as standard. It 
consists of two Soft Close Automatic drives that lock the trunk lid to the rear module car¬ 
rier on the left and right. This increases the stability of the trunk area. 

Opening theTrunk Lid 

When the trunk lid is opened using the trunk lid button, a microswitch is actuated and its 
status is read by the junction boxj B.The J B sends a message to the CAS via K-CAN. 
Afterthe check is successfully completed, the CAS sends the release and thej B trig¬ 
gers the drive for unlocking the trunk lid. The drive actuates the release catch; the left and 
right trunk lid locks are unlocked via the control cables. 

The J B transmits the status of the trunk lid (unlocked) on K-CAN, and the CTM receives 
it. The CTM then triggers the start-up of the SCA drives, which then move to standby 
position and are available for a closing operation orto support a closing operation. 

Closing theTrunk Lid 

When the trunk lid is closed, the SCA drives are in standby position. When the left and 
right trunk lid locks have reached the locking clips, two microswitches are actuated and 
their status is read in by the CTM. The CTM then triggers both SCA drives (one on each 
SCA drive) until two other microswitches signal the "trunk lid locked" status to the CTM. 


18 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 



Manually closing the trunk lid would make closing via the Soft Close Automatic drive 
unnecessary. However, because it must be ensured that the trunk lid is really closed, the 
Soft Close Automatic drive is actuated nonetheless. The end position of the SCA drives 
in the "Unlocked" status is signalled to the CTM by two additional microswitches. 

Non-repeat Lock 

Each Soft Close Automatic drive has a non repeat lock to prevent overheating of the Soft 
Close Automatic drive. It allows up to 20 actuations of the Soft Close Automatic drive. 
Afterwards, the Soft Close Automatic drive is electrically disabled for approx. 2 minutes.

System Components 

Mechanical Components 

The retractable hardtop is a roof system in steel construction. 

This system withstands speeds up to 270 km/h (167mph) and has a sophisticated water 
management system for draining remaining water when the roof is extended or retracted. 

AM/FM antennas are integrated into the bonded rear window. 

The retractable hardtop is designed as a three-part roof system. The hardtop roof panels 
are made of steel in a classic sandwich construction and are engineered for optimum 
weight and rigidity. 

A central hydraulic system located in the luggage compartment floor operates the kine¬ 
matic movement of 8 hydraulic cylinders in the overall system.

Roof Module 

The roof module consists of 3 roof sections, linkage, main mount and the hydraulics. 

The movement sequence of the retractable hardtop is driven by a central hydraulic sys¬ 
tem with hydraulic 8-cylinder activation, with an additional 2 gas pressure dampers in the 
main mount. 

A total of 8 hydraulic cylinders and 6 gas pressure dampers are used in the retractable 
hardtop. The hydraulic system is controlled via the Convertible Top Module (CTM) and is 
built into a multifunctional tray in the luggage compartment floor. 

A central electric motor in the front roof section serves to lock the entire retractable hard¬ 
top system. The roof sections are interlocked using drive cable tubes, similar to a sunroof 
drive. 

The roof module weighs about 98kg (2161b) (about 941b more than a soft top)

Water Management 

The water flows from the roof channel into a water drain through a duct system with valve 
on the main guide bar. 

When the retractable hardtop is stowed while wet, any remaining water droplets are col¬ 
lected in the side storage trays and the channel in the trunk sill panel, where they can 
evaporate. This provides items of luggage with maximum protection from remaining 
water.

If the button is released while the hardtop is moving, then the movement of the 
retractable hardtop, the rear module orthe side windows is immediately interrupted. The 
hardtop movement can be resumed by actuating the switch again. It has two contacts 
that are switched to ground and that are closed alternatively. The function display on the 
button has two LEDs (red and green). 

• The green LED in the button lights up during the opening/closing operation. 

• The blinking red LED indicates that a system operation has been interrupted in mid 
movement, as the movement resumes the green LED lights up again until the oper¬ 
ation is complete. 

• The solid red LED signals incorrect operation or hazardous situations by one or 
more of the preconditions for operation have not been met. For example, the hardtop 
cannot be opened if the luggage compartment divider is not in the lower position or 
ambient temperature is below 10°F. In this case, the red LED is lit continuously.The 
CTM detects the status of the button. 


26 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 















Convertible Top Module (CTM) 

The (CTM) is the central electronic control 
module for all functions of the retractable 
hardtop. The location of the CTM is to the 
right of the compartment divider. The CTM 
controls the retractable hardtop, the rear 
module and the Soft Close Automatic fea¬ 
ture. 

Power is supplied to the CTM by the junc¬ 
tion box with terminal 30g. 

There is an additional power supply to the 
CTM via terminal 15 of the Car Access 
System (CAS) so that in certain cases of 
malfunction, such as an interrupted supply 
from the junction box, adequate diagnos¬ 
tics and communication with the diagnos¬ 
tic tester are possible. 

The CTM controls the electric motor for 
the interlocking of the roof panels and of 
the front roof panel to the cowl panel. In 
addition, it controls the hydraulic pump and 
the 8 hydraulic cylinders via 5 valves in the 
hydraulic unit. 

During the hardtop and rear module movements, the respective position is detected by 9 
Hall sensors and 5 microswitches in the cowl panel, hardtop and rear module and for¬ 
warded to the CTM via the respective wiring harness. Each of them signals whether a 
certain status has been reached and whether the CTM can initiate the next phase. The 
current supply of the microswitches/Hall sensors is provided by the CTM. The CTM also 
reads in the status ofthe button. 

The CTM is connected to other control modules via the K-CAN. For example, information 
about the outside temperature, driving speed and status ofthe trunk lid is received via K- 
CAN. When the hardtop is opened or closed, the CTM sends the request to lowerthe 
side windows to the FRM. 

In certain critical situations, the CTM triggers introductions that are easily understandable 
to the customer in the instrument cluster as check control messages and text messages 
in the CID. A list of check control messages is provided in the "Service information" sec¬ 
tion of this Product Information. 

Depending on whether the roof is closed or open, the CTM transmits a signal to the 
antenna diversity module for it to select best antenna to maintain proper reception.

Roof Sections Locking Sequence 

When the front roof panel has reached the cowl panel, the electric motor is activated. The 
left and right drive cables are driven via the gear on the electric motor (in a manner similar 
to the sliding/tilt sunroof). The ends of the drive cables have locking bolts (pins) that are 
pushed from the front roof panel into the center roof panel and thus lock these roof sec¬ 
tions together. Simultaneously these locking bolts press against springloaded elements in 
the center roof panel then act on flexible rods, that push a second set of locking bolts 
(pins) to secure roof panels 2 and 3. 

While the drive cables are operated, the connecting rods are simultaneously activated via 
the control disk. The force is transmitted from the gearwheel of the electric motor to the 
connecting rods via the splines on the control disk. The left and right connecting rods 
separate, and the front roof panel is locked to the cowl panel via the catch hooks. The 
locking hook, which locks the front roof panel to the center roof panel, is also driven via 
the center connecting rod. 

The roof panels are unlocked by reversing this operation. The end positions of the elec¬ 
tric motor are detected by two microswitches and forwarded to the CTM.

To prevent damage to the roof package when stowed, such as when driving over pot¬ 
holes, etc., the front roof section is locked in the luggage compartment. Locking the front 
roof panel secures the entire roof package in place, which also prevents noises (such as 
squeaks, groaning or rattles). 

When the roof sections have been stowed in the luggage compartment, the electric 
motor is activated. The catch hooks are locked to the base plates via the catch hooks. In 
addition, the locking bolts (driven by the drive cables) move into the guides. Thus the 
front roof panel is securely locked in the luggage compartment.

Microswitches and Hall Sensors 



The various positions of the retractable hardtop and the rear module are detected via 9 
Hall sensors and 5 microswitches and sent to the CTM. All Hall sensors and 
microswitches are supplied with voltage by the CTM and are capable of diagnostics. 

"Cowl panel reached" Microswitch (1) 

• This microswitch is built into the left cowl panel on the vehicle.The 
CTM evaluates the signal ofthe microswitch. When the guide pin 
of the front roof panel has reached the cowl panel, the 
microswitch is closed. Beginning at this position, the electric 
motor is activated and the roof sections are locked. 

"Catch hooks locked" Microswitch (2) 

• This microswitch is installed on the left below the electric motor for hardtop locking 
mechanism.The contacts ofthe microswitch are opened if the catch hooks are 
locked all the way.The CTM reads in the status ofthe microswitch.The catch hooks 
can be locked both at the cowl panel and at the base plate in the luggage compart¬ 
ment. When the hardtop is closed all the way, the contacts ofthe microswitch are 
open.The CTM receives a "High" signal. When the hardtop is opened, the catch 
hooks are unlocked and the contacts ofthe microswitch are closed. Afterthe roof 
package is stowed in the luggage compartment, 

the catch hooks at the base plate are locked and 
the contacts ofthe microswitch are opened.

"Catch hooks unlocked" Microswitch (3) 

• This microswitch is installed on the right below the 
electric motor for hardtop locking. The contacts of 
this microswitch are opened if the catch hooks at the 

cowl panel are locked all the way.The status ofthe microswitch is read in by the 
CTM. When a High signal is received by the CTM, the opening ofthe ofthe catch 
hooks ofthe hardtop is complete. Furthermore, the locking ofthe front roof panel to 
the center roof section and the interlocking of all three roof sections are separated. If 
the roof panels are subsequently lifted above each other and are stowed in the lug¬ 
gage compartment, the contacts ofthe microswitch remain open. Only when the 
catch hooks begin to lock are the contacts ofthe microswitch closed again.

"Roof panels partially open/partially closed" Hall Sensor (5-6) 

Two Hall sensors are installed on the right roof panel cylinder and detect the movement 
of the piston in the roof panel cylinder. If the piston is extended, a signal is sent from the 
"Roof panels partially open" Hall sensor to the CTM. In this position, the roof sections are 
positioned completely above each other and can now be stowed in the luggage compart¬ 
ment. The "Roof panels partially closed" Hall sensor sends a signal to the CTM when the 
piston in the roof panel cylinder is almost completely retracted. From this position, the 
hardtop closes more slowly until it reaches the cowl panel (indirect pressure-sensitive fin¬ 
ger guard system).

"Rightclosure open" Hall Sensor (7) 

This Hall sensor is located on the right closure cylinder. 

It transmits a signal to the CTM when the piston of the 
closure cylinder is fully extended. In this position, the 
lock of the rear module and the rear roof panel to the 
body is disengaged. 

"Left/rightclosure closed" Microswitch (8 and 15) 

One microswitch is on both the left and right closure cylinder. 
These microswitches transmit a signal to the CTM when the clo 
sure is locked. 

" Rear module closed" Hall Sensor (9) 

This Hall sensor is installed on the right of the divider module. 

It transmits a signal to the CT M when the rear module has 
reached the bottom position. The rear module has a bow that 
changes the voltage in the Hall sensor when it reaches the 
end position.

"Roof package stowed" Hall Sensor (10) 

This Hall sensor is installed on the right base plate in the luggage 
compartment. It transmits a signal to the CT M when the guide pin 
of the front roof panel has reached the guide in the base plate. ^ 

Beginning at this position, the drive for the hardtop lock can be * 

activated and the rear module can be closed. 


" Rear module opened/rear module almost closed" Hall Sensor (11-12) 

Two Hall sensors are installed on the right rear module cylinder and detect the movement 
of the piston in the rear module cylinder. If the piston is extended, a signal is sent from the 
top "Rear module open" Hall sensorto the CTM. In this position, the rear module is com¬ 
pletely open and the roof panel package can be stowed in or lifted out of the luggage 
compartment. The lower "Rear module almost closed" Hall sensor sends a signal to the 
CTM when the piston in the rear module cylinder is almost completely extended. From 
this position, the rear module closes more slowly until it reaches the end position.

“Luggage compartment divider" Hall Sensor (13) 

The Hall sensorforthe luggage compartment divider signals that the luggage compart¬ 
ment divider is in the bottom position and thus that an important function condition is 
met. If this signal is missing, the hardtop cannot be actuated. 

The Hall sensor is installed on the left rear module mount on the vehicle.

Hydraulic Overview 

The retractable hardtop and the rear module are driven hydraulically. The hydraulic sys¬ 
tem consists of 8 hydraulic cylinders that are supplied with pressure by the hydraulic sys¬ 
tem via the hydraulic lines.The cylinders are always activated in pairs. The hydraulic 
assembly is installed in a recess in the luggage compartment floor. Four cylinders are 
required forthe movement of the hardtop: 

• Two roof panel cylinders and two rear pillar cylinders. 

• The rear module is opened and closed by two rear module cylinders. 

• Two closures are responsible for locking/unlocking the rear roof panel and 
the rear module.

Relay for clockwise operation 


The movement direction of the hardtop and rear module are determined by correspond¬ 
ing valve positions and by reversing the direction of rotation of the pump. The hydraulic 
pump in the hydraulic unit is driven by an electric motor that operates in two directions of 
rotation. Both rotation directions are implemented with a relay switch. 

The pump motor and the five hydraulic valves are activated by the CTM.The power con¬ 
sumption of the electric motor is about 40A (safeguarded by a 50A fuse). The hydraulic 
pump generates an operating pressure of 150 to 200bar. 

To prevent the pump motorfrom overheating if the hardtop is operated frequently, the 
temperature of the pump motor is measured using an NTC resistor. The NTC resistor is 
connected to the CTM via two wires with a floating ground. An open circuit causes an 
entry in the fault code memory, but does not prevent the hardtop from moving. Two tem¬ 
perature values are particularly important. The lower of these is around 90°C (194°F)and 
serves as an "early warning". If this temperature is exceeded, any hardtop movement that 
has already begun is continued until it has safely come to an end. If the temperature 
reaches 105°C (221°F), the hardtop movement is stopped immediately. It cannot be 
resumed until the temperature falls back below 90°C. 

• If the hardtop movement is interrupted, the hardtop remains in the hold position. 

The pressure in the hydraulic system is maintained at all times and is not shut off. 

• In case of an emergency actuation of the hardtop, the bleed screw on the 
hydraulic pump must be released. 

• The hydraulic fluid does not need to be changed (lifetime). 

• If the hydraulic fluid needs to be refilled due to leaks ensure that the approved 
hydraulic fluid is used. Add hydraulic fluid only up to the mark on the reservoir. 

• If a lot of noise is heard while the hardtop is actuated, the hardtop must be 
opened and closed a few times in succession to allow the system to bleed. 

• The hydraulic system is automatically bled in the reservoir. 


39 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 






























Closure Cylinders 

The closure cylinders lock the rear roof panel and rear module to the body. Before the 
hardtop can be opened, the rear roof panel must be unlocked. It is unlocked by extending 
the piston. A Hall sensor is installed on the right cylinder that detects the position of the 
extended piston. Since the cylinders are de-pressurized if the hydraulic pump is not acti¬ 
vated, they are engaged while locked or activated via dead center. 

The locking is signaled to the CTM by two microswitches (one on each of the two clo¬ 
sure cylinders). When the hardtop is closed, afterthe roof package is extended and the 
rear module is closed, the closure cylinders are retracted in order to push the rear module 
all the way into the lower position. Then, the closures open and are not closed until the 
roof panels are interlocked and locked to the cowl panel. The rear roof panel and the rear 
module are locked to the body by closing the closures.

Roof Panel Cylinders 

The movement of the roof sections is carried out using two roof panel cylinders. The 
actuation direction of the roof panel cylinders depends on the rotation direction of the 
hydraulic pump. 

• When the pistons have retracted into the roof, the hardtop is closed. 

• When the roof panel cylinders are pressurized on the piston side, the pistons are 
extended and move the roof panels above each other via the roof panel control arms. 

• Two Hall sensors are installed on the right roof panel cylinder and detect the position 
of the piston. 


41 

E93 Retractable Hardtop 























• When the roof panel cylinders are pressurized on the rod side, the pistons are 
retracted and the roof panels separate. 

• When the Hall sensordetects the position of the retracting piston, the pressure in 
the cylinder is reduced. 


In addition, the spring on the roof panel cylinder acts counterto the movement direction. 
The reason for this is that the front roof panel moves into the front cowl very slowly, result¬ 
ing in a harmonious hardtop movement. The slow movement also minimizes the risk of 
becoming trapped.

Main PillarCylinders 

The main pillar cylinders serve to stow the roof package in the luggage compartment and 
to lift it out of the luggage compartment. When the rear pillar cylinders are retracted, the 
roof package is lifted. The roof package is stowed by extending the main pillar cylinders. 

A Hall sensor is installed on the right main pillar cylinderthat signals the "Roof panels 
extended" position to the CTM.The uniform movement of the roof package is supported 
by 2 gas pressure dampers in the main mount.

Rear Module Cylinders 

The rear module is opened and closed by the rear module cylinders. When the rear pillar 
cylinders are retracted, the rear module is closed. The rear module is opened by extend¬ 
ing the pistons in the rear module cylinders. Two Hall sensors are installed on the right 
rear module cylinder. The upper Hall sensor detects the position of the opened rear mod¬ 
ule.The lowerHall sensorsignals to the CTM that the rear module is almost closed. 
Beginning at this position, the pressure in the rear module cylinders is reduced and the 
rear module is slowly closed until it reaches the end position.
