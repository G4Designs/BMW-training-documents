Bus Network 


The vehicle systems network US differs in that it features other systems provided specifi¬ 
cally forthe USA and Canada. 

Since no diesel vehicles are currently offered in the USA, the corresponding control units 
have been omitted on the PT-CAN and BSD. 

Changes in K-CAN 

A new feature is the Convertible top module (CTM) which is connected to the K-CAN for 
the purpose of controlling the retractable hardtop. 

The ACSM 2 is used as the passive safety system which contains the sensors forthe 
rollover protection system. 

The SINE of the anti-theft alarm system DWA is no longer looped through the roof 
functions module FZD but rather connected directly to the K-CAN. 

The RDC (TPMS) is a tire pressure monitoring system that replaces the tire failure 
indicator RPA in US vehicles to conform to legal requirements. 

Changes in LIN-bus 

Two control units forthe seat belt extender on the driver's and passenger's side have 
been dropped from the LIN-bus as the seat belt in the Convertible is located directly in 
the seat.

Energy Management 

As in the current models, an energy management system is also used on the BMW 3 
Series Convertible to ensure a balanced energy supply in the vehicle. 

The energy management functions are integrated in the power management system that 
is implemented in the form of software in the engine control module (DM E). 

The power management, the components and the various functions of the system differ 
depending on the equipment configuration of the vehicle. 

Two energy management control systems are installed: 

• Basic Power Management BPM 

• Advanced Power Management APM 

On vehicles equipped with advanced power management modifications have been made 
in the terminal shut-down system through relay 30g and 30g f. 

Advanced Power Management 

Advanced power management (APM) is used on vehicles featuring following options: 

• Comfort access 

• Multi-audio system controller 

• Car communication computer 

• Telephone US/telephone preparation US 

The advanced power management has been expanded by the intelligent battery sensor 
IBS. In addition to the change in the idle speed and the specified charging voltage target 
value, the system includes the following functions that differfrom the BPM. 

Expanded APM Functions 

• Electric load reduction 

• Electric load shut-down 

• Systems network diagnosis 

• Battery diagnosis

Terminal Shut-down Identification 

To provide clear identification of the terminal shut-down function, the control units are 
identified with colored triangles. The identification and assignment to the individual ter¬ 
minals is shown in the legend on the opposing page. 

Electric Load Shut-down Terminal 30g Relay 

Time-dependent shut-down - The E93 is equipped with a terminal 30g relay for switch¬ 
ing off the power supply to most control units. M ost convenience electric loads such as 
the radio are switched off after 30 minutes by terminal 30g in orderto maintain the start¬ 
ing capability of the battery. 

The after-running time is extended to 60 minutes if a telephone is installed in the vehicle. 
The terminal 30g relay is activated by the car access system. 

Electric Load Shut-down Terminal 30g_f Relay 

Fault-dependent shut-down - The terminal 30g_f relay is additionally installed in the 
junction box of the E93 only when one of the following equipment options is ordered: 

• Comfort access 

• M-Audio system controller 

• Car communication computer 

• Telephone US/telephone preparation US 

The terminal 30g_f relay is a bistable relay and is always in the ON state under normal 
conditions. It switches off the connected control units only in the case of fault. The 
switching status is retained even when no power is applied. 

The terminal 30g_f relay is activated by the junction box control unit and switches off the 
connected electric loads if a fault occurs. The calculations required for activating the 
terminal 30g_f relay take place in the DM E and in the junction box. The following activi¬ 
ties are monitored in the junction box: 

• Unauthorized wake-ups within the bus system 

• Sleep mode preventers (control units that constantly keep the bus systems active) 

The battery values are constantly read out and evaluated in the engine control unit. The 
relay is also switched off when the starting capability limit of the vehicle battery is 
reached.

E93 Electronic Systems 



Control Units (connected to terminal 30) 

Due to theirfunctionality, some control units cannot be switched off and must remain 
connected to KL30. The following chart shows the control modules connected to KL30 
and the reasons why this is needed.

General Vehicle Electrical System 


The general vehicle electrical system includes the following: 

• Exterior lighting 

• Interior lighting 

• Central locking system 

• Anti-theft alarm system 

• Rooffunctions module 

• Seat with rear easy-entry 

• Changes in control units 

• Powerwindows 

Exterior Lighting 

No changes have been made to the exterior lighting of the E93 Convertible compared to 
the E92 Coupe. The E93 Convertible is equipped as standard with bi-xenon lights. 

Adaptive headlights are optionally available in connection with the turn signal or direction 
indicator light. 

The E93 Convertible is equipped as standard with the daytime driving lightfunction that 
is realized by the corona rings. The E93 Convertible also features the welcome light 
function. 

Note: Important note on tail lights - In the event of a defective bulb in the tail lights, 
after removal, the bulb carrier must be fitted in the tail light housing otherwise the 
function of the new bulb cannot be checked due to the lack of ground connec¬ 
tion. 

Interior Lighting 

The interior lighting system of the E93 Convertible was adopted from the E92 with 
ambient interior lighting in the door and side trim panels. 

Forthis reason, the general functions and the components of the interior lighting system 
will not be described in detail again here. The following minor changes have been made 
to the optional interior lights package: 

• No rear interior light in the roof 

• The central luggage compartment light has been replaced by two lights at the rear 
left and right

Central Locking System 

The central locking system has been adapted to the specific requirements of the 
Convertible. In addition to the basic functions of locking the doors, lids and flaps, two 
furtherfunctions have been added: 

• automatic locking and opening of the glove compartment 

• and the locking of the storage compartment in the center console. 

These functions are necessary for the purpose of providing a safe place to store objects 
with the hardtop open. 


Glove Compartment Locking 

The glove compartment is unlocked by electrical means. The reason forthis is that a 
knee airbag is installed in US vehicles. The knee airbag is located in the lid to the glove 
compartment. 


The opener is located on the left on the glove compartment lid. The lid must be locked 
on both sides to ensure the resulting forces can be transmitted in the event of the knee 
airbag triggering.

E93 Electronic Systems 





























Opening Glove Compartment 

The opener is raised slightly to open the glove compartment. A microswitch sends a 
signal to the junction box which, in turn, activates an actuator motor in the glove compart¬ 
ment. The actuator motor with the gear mechanism pulls backthe two locking rods so 
that the glove compartment lid can be opened. 

The power supply to the actuator motor is cut after a short time and the locking rods 
extend again. 

Closing Glove Compartment 

The ends of the locking rods are beveled. When closing the lid, the rods are pressed 
against a spring. When the lid is closed, the spring force pushes the locking rods back 
into the lock openings thus locking the glove compartment lid. 

Locking Glove Compartment 

The hotel switch is located in the glove compartment. The hotel switch can prevent 
unauthorized opening of the boot lid. Forthis purpose, the glove compartment is locked 
with the mechanical key at the lock barrel. 

Emergency Release of Glove Compartment 

In the event of the battery discharging or being defective, the glove compartment can be 
opened with the mechanical key. 

Locking Function of Storage Compartment in Center Console 

The storage compartment, in which the mobile phone is kept (depending on equipment 
variant) contains an actuator motor which locks the storage compartment. This actuator 
motor is driven directly by the junction box when central arrest is activated. 

Emergency Release 

The storage compartment in the center 
console can be released by means of a pull 
cable (1) in the event of the battery discharg¬ 
ing or being defective. 

Forthis purpose, the cover must be removed 
from the rear compartment air outlet, fol¬ 
lowed by removal of the air outlet. 

The storage compartment can then be 
released by pulling the loop of the pull cable.

Anti-theft Alarm System 

The anti-theft alarm system in the E93 Convertible is identical to that in the 3 Series 
Sedan in terms of its basic functions and operating mode. There are differences in the 
interior monitoring function and connection to the system network. 

Microwave sensors, as in the E64 Convertible, are used forthe interior monitoring system 
instead of ultrasonic sensors. The microwave sensors facilitate monitoring of the vehicle 
interior also when the convertible top is down. 

The microwave sensors have a semicircular radiation characteristic. By strategic place¬ 
ment in the vehicle, the entire interior can be monitored without the microwave sensors 
radiating outside the vehicle. 

Four microwave sensors are used on the E93 Convertible forthe purpose of monitoring 
the interior. The microwave sensors are connected via the DWA bus to the SINE (siren 
with tilt alarm sensor). The DWA bus is a sub bus based on the K-bus. SINE is the 
master control unit and is connected directly to the KCAN.The entire control ofthe anti¬ 
theft alarm system is located in the SINE.

PowerSeats with Easy Entry Function 

Special seats with a seat-integrated seat belt system as in the E46/E64 are installed in 
the E93 Convertible. The electrically adjustable seats (comfort and sport) are equipped 
with a rear compartment easy-entry function to facilitate entry in the rear compartment. 

Forthis purpose, an adjustment switch is provided on the upper end of the backrest in 
orderto move the seat forward and backward at double the speed via the seat 
forward/backward adjustment function. 

When entering the rear compartment, the customer can move the seat forward with the 
adjustment switch. By mechanically releasing the seat backrest, it can be additionally 
tilted forward to create sufficient space for convenient entry.

Explanation

Backrest release lever 


At the same time, the headrest is retracted so that the backrest can be completely folded 
down and does not come in contact with the sun visor. Retraction of the headrest 
depends on the position of the seat. The headrest is not retracted if the seat position is 
set in the area approximately 8-10 cm from the rear end stop as there is sufficient space 
to fully fold down the backrest in this position. 


26 

E93 Electronic Systems 













Following entry, the backrest is folded back, the headrest automatically returns to its 
previous position and the seat can be moved back using the adjustment switch. The 
position of the headrest is detected by a Hall sensor on the headrest adjustment motor. 

The seat moves back and assumes the previous position. The previous position is also 
determined by means of a Hall sensor on the seat forward/backward adjustment motor. 
The signals from the Hall sensors are read into the driver or passenger seat module and 
correspondingly evaluated. The front passenger seat module has no memory function. 

A new feature of the seat in the Convertible is the integration of the side airbag in the 
backrest. The use of the SGS seat with integrated seat belt system makes it necessary 
to monitorthe backrest lock. If the backrest were not locked correctly, there would be the 
danger of the occupant moving forward with the backrest without any restraint effect. 

This would be equivalent to the occupant not wearing a seat belt. 

Forthis reason, the backrests on the driver and front passenger seats are monitored to 
ensure they are locked correctly. The driver/passenger seat modules monitorthe position 
with Hall sensors in the backrest. The information is sentto the crash safety module via 
the K-CAN link. The information is used in the calculation of the triggering algorithm. 

A backrest that is not locked correctly would have the same effect on the triggering 
characteristics as an occupant not wearing a seat belt. 

If the backrests are not locked correctly, the driver/passenger seat module generates 
check control messages which are sent via the K-CAN to the instrument cluster and the 
central information display.

C hanges to C ontrol U nits 

Due to the various mechanical and electrical changes on the E93, some control modules 
have been modified or moved from theirfamiliar locations. Brief explanations of these 
changes are in the following pages. 

Roof Functions Module (FZD) 

The roof functions module has been adapted in terms of its functionality and geometric 
form to the specific requirements of the E93 Convertible. 

The following functions have been adopted: 

• Interior lights, reading light and top light 

• Connection of the electrochromic interior rear/view mirrorand transmission of values 
on the K-CAN 

• Connection of rain/lights sensorvia LIN 

• Gateway function LIN > K-CAN 

• Connection of the condensation sensor and transmission on the K-CAN 

• Emergency call button (option) 

• Passenger airbag OFF light (option) 

The following functions have been dropped: 

• Connection of interior lights at rear 

• Ultrasonic interior movement detector 

• Operation and actuation of slide/tilt sunroof 

• M icrophones for hands-free and voice input 

On the E93 Convertible, the microphones for hands-free and voice input are located on 
the steering column trim panel. 



E93 Electronic Systems 


J unction Box 

The functions of the junction box have been included to drive the actuators forthe glove 
compartment and storage compartment in the center console. 

The gateway function has been adapted to accommodate the D-CAN. At present, all 
other models are still equipped with the previous diagnosis interface (K-LINE 115 kbit/s). 



33 

E93 Electronic Systems 




Footwell Module 

As the master control unit for the power win¬ 
dows, the footwell module is responsible for 
evaluation of the central power window switch. 
The central power window switch in the 
Convertible makes it possible to open and 
close all four side windows simultaneously. 

A furtherfunction is the extended travel range 
of the powerwindows as on the E46/E64 
Convertible. The extended travel range func¬ 
tion of the powerwindows is activated when 
the retractable hardtop is lowered. All side win¬ 
dows are lowered almost fully during this oper¬ 
ation to ensure smooth opening.

PowerWindows 

The E93 Convertible is equipped as standard with powerwindows at the front and rear. 

In addition to the individual power window buttons, the switch cluster on the driver's side 
contains a central button (1), with which all windows can be lowered simultaneously. 

As a standard feature on BMW Convertibles, the side windows are frame-less. 

The windows mustenterthe door seal by several millimeters in orderto avoid leaks and 
wind noise. 

The door windows must be lowered by approximately 15 mm to ensure the doors can be 
opened and closed without applying any effort.

Automatic Climate Control 

The E93 Convertible is available with the following heating/air conditioning systems: 

• Integrated automatic climate control (IHKA) 

The E93 Convertible with its retractable hardtop combines two vehicles in one. It is a 
Coupe when closed and a Convertible when open, a fact taken into account by the auto¬ 
matic climate control to create pleasant and comfortable heating/ventilation conditions. 

This characteristic makes it possible for an individual climate control program for both 
states. The software automatically initiates the automatic climate control program when it 
detects that the hardtop is down. 

Trials and customer surveys have shown that the previous air conditioning systems setup 
for Sedans or Coupes were not ideal for a Convertible with the top down. 

The temperature and blower output stage had to be constantly readjusted for the 
purpose of ensuring pleasant interior conditions. 

All control parameters are adapted to the requirements of driving with the top down when 
the hardtop is lowered. 

Convertible mode requires no additional sensors. The IHKA control unit was 
programmed with corresponding software that takes these specific parameters into 
account. 

Convertible Mode Setting 

Convertible mode is available only in vehicles equipped with the optional fully automatic 
climate control (IHKA). 

Convertible mode is activated by opening the retractable hardtop. The IHKA receives the 
corresponding information on the status of the hardtop from the Convertible top module 
(CTM). 

Convertible mode is always active on vehicles with no central information display (CID). 

On vehicles with central information display, the Convertible M ode box in the "Automatic 
Program" menu must first be activated. This activation is possibly only with the hardtop 
open and is set to active as part of initial programming. 

Note: If Convertible mode is not activated, the selected automatic program 
(soft, medium, intensive) is activated when the hardtop is opened.

All other program settings are deactivated (grey) if Convertible mode is activated with the 
hardtop lowered. The other program settings can be selected if Convertible mode is not 
activated with the hardtop lowered. 

Convertible mode cannot be selected when the hardtop is closed. Convertible mode 
that has already been selected is correspondingly indicated, however, it is not active when 
the hardtop is closed (grey) and can also not be changed.

E93 Electronic Systems 







Convertible Mode Control 

The aim of Convertible mode is to create an automatic climate control program that 
makes it unnecessary to continually make manual adjustments while driving. 

When driving with the top down, the occupants consciously expose themselves to the 
solar radiation and outside temperature at changing driving speeds. These parameters 
have a decisive influence on the climate in the vehicle interior and must therefore be 
taken into consideration in the control concept. 

The spatial separation of the interior is cancelled when the hardtop is opened thus 
drastically reducing the influence of the interior temperature sensor. The temperature 
control for the vent outlet temperature is strongly orientated on the outside temperature. 

The sun's intensity has a great influence on the climate in the vehicle interior when 
driving with the top down. Therefore, changes in conditions such as cloudless, cloudy or 
daytime/night-time are included via the solar sensorto a greater extent in the temperature 
control than when the hardtop is up. 

Unlike when the vehicle is closed, the ventilation outlets become the dominant air 
distribution level when the hardtop is down and are therefore always fully opened while, 
to achieve a comfort balance, the footwell outlets must always be restricted as soon as 
the operating temperature of the engine necessary for heating is reached. 

M easures for keeping the windscreen/windows clear are not necessary when driving with 
the top down, therefore the defrost outlets always remain closed. 

The driver sets the required temperature at the temperature control. Depending on the 
outside temperature, sun's intensity and vehicle speed, the required interior climate is 
maintained by the supply of correspondingly temperature-controlled air. The most 
comfortable conditions are achieved with the side windows closed and a wind deflector 
additionally installed. 

The ram pressure compensation that serves the purpose of keeping the airthroughput 
constant when the vehicle is closed is cancelled in Convertible mode. The blower output 
Is additionally increased based on the vehicle speed in orderto maintain a constant air 
flow about the occupants. 

The increasing air volume essentially shields the occupants from increasing turbulence at 
highervehicle speeds. The occupants subjectively notice no difference in temperature 
conditions. 

The AUC function is also active in Convertible mode up to a speed of 45 M PH. It is 
deactivated at higher speeds. This is intended to ensure that no pollutants are blown into 
the interior of the vehicle via the air conditioning outlets when driving at low speeds, e.g. 
in urban or stop-and-go traffic. The best effect is achieved with the side windows closed.

Antenna Systems 

Since the standard locations for antennas on the roof or in the fixed rear window are not 
available on the E93 Convertible, the various antenna systems are distributed and 
integrated in the vehicle. Antennas are required forthe following systems: 

• Radio 

• Digital receivers 

• Navigation 

• Telephone and telematics 

• Remote control 

With the exception of the SDARS antenna, the E93 Convertible has no visible antennas. 
The Convertible does not even have the standard rod antenna, a feature contributing to 
the harmonious appearance of the exterior. 


AM/FM Antennas 

FourFM antennas (FMl-FM4)and one AM antenna that are switched via an FM antenna 
diversity function are used for radio reception in the E93 Convertible.

Different antennas are used when the hardtop is closed or lowered. When closed, the 
AM, FM1 and FM 3 antennas in the rear window are used as in a Coupe. The antenna 
amplifier and the rejector circuit for the rear window defoggerare located on the left 
C-pillar. There is only a rejector circuit on the right-hand C-pillar. 

The E93 Convertible has many information and communication antennas all of which, 
except forone, are concealed. Only the SDARS antenna on US vehicles is located on the 
rear lid as this requires a direct reception path to the satellites. The antenna systems are 
divided into radio, digital receiver, telephone, navigation and remote control. 

The FM2 and FM4 antennas are located behind the rear bumper panel. The antenna 
amplifiers for the FM2 and FM4 antennas are located in the antenna diversity module on 
the rear left in the luggage compartment.

Changeover voltage/diagnosis 


The switchover between the antennas in the rear window and side trim panels takes 
place by means of a signal from the Convertible top module CTM. 

The sequence of FM antenna diversity is not defined as on previous models. On the 
E93, the reception quality and field strength of all antennas are checked and stored in a 
memory. 

The next best FM antenna in the list is selected if the signal quality of the radio station 
received at the active antenna is insufficient in terms of quality and field strength. 

The antennas are evaluated and the list updated at the same time as the switchover 
between the individual antennas. 


47 

E93 Electronic Systems 

















Changeover takes place in such a way that no interruption is heard. The high frequency 
signal (RF) of the active FM antenna is routed from the antenna diversity module via a 
coaxial cable to the tunerforthe radio or navigation system. The signal is de-modulate in 
the tuner and output via the speakers as an audio signal. 

The radio or navigation system detects whether a diversity module is installed and 
generates the changeover voltage (Us) necessary for diversity operation and the 
intermediate frequency signal (IF). 

The IF is evaluated by the electronic circuitry in the diversity module and is a copy of the 
radio station currently heard on the fixed frequency of 10.7 MHz. 

The changeover between AM/FM1 reception and diagnosis mode takes place with the 
aid of the changeover voltage. This voltage is generated by the radio and used in the 
diversity module forevaluation purposes. 

Diversity mode is active at 2.5 volts (Us =2.5 V). AM mode is active orthe FM 1 antenna 
selected at 0 Volts (Us = 0 V). Diagnosis mode is active at 5 Volts (Us = 5 V). 

Up to three signals can be transmitted simultaneously on the coaxial cable: 

• RF signal (e.g. 87.5 - 108 M Hz) from diversity module to radio 

• Control voltage (Us)from radio to diversity module 

• Intermediate frequency (IF =10.7 MHz)from radio to diversity module as basis for 
assessing the quality of the RF signal. 

M utual influencing is not possible due to the different frequencies. The frequency of the 
antenna diversity module is 87.5-108 M Hz. 

Note: No antenna diversity is provided forSW, MW and LW reception as there 
is only one AM antenna.

Antennas forTelephone and Telematics 


The following antennas are required fortelephone and telematics functions: 


• Telephone antenna 

• Telematics antenna 

• SOS antenna 

• GPS antenna 

• Bluetooth antenna for internal communication 

Telephone Antenna 

The telephone antenna is located underthe side panel on 
the front left. This position is possible as the side panels 
on the E93 Convertible are made of plastic. 

The telephone antenna is routed directly to the eject box in 
the center console. 



Telematics Antenna 

The telematics antenna (1) is located on the rear bumper underthe left tail light. 

On vehicles equipped with the Assist, the telematics antenna is connected directly to the 
telematics control unitTCU and is used solely for data transmission relating to telematics 
functions. 



54 

E93 Electronic Systems 






SOS Antenna 

The SOS antenna (2) is activated if the emergency call 
function is no longer possible via the telematics antenna 
after an accident. The SOS antenna is installed underthe 
side trim panel on the rear left. 



Bluetooth Antenna 

The Bluetooth antenna (1) is used for internal transmission 
of data between the mobile phone and vehicle. 

The antenna is located in the leftfootwell trim panel. 



GPS Antenna 

A GPS antenna (2) is necessary for the telematics function - Automatic emergency call 
with location -. On vehicles with CCC navigation system, the GPS antenna is routed 
directly to the navigation computer. TheTCU receives the position data via the MOST. 


The GPS antenna is connected directly to theTCU on vehicles with no navigation system 
but with radio Professional and telematics functions. In this case, theTCU determines the 
location. The GPS antenna is located behind the rooffunctions module in the roof frame.

Passive Safety Systems 

In the same way as the Sedan, the E93 Convertible offers vehicle safety at the highest 
level for all occupants as well as in all crash situations. Numerous reinforcements have 
been implemented in the body forthe purpose of conforming to worldwide stipulations 
relating to a uniform body. 

The loads and stresses that occur in the case of a crash are counteracted by a reinforced 
floor assembly and a reinforced bulkhead with high-strength A-pillars. The reinforced floor 
assembly is required particularly in the area of the front seats in orderto direct the forces 
that are exerted in the event of a crash by the seat integrated seat belt systems into the 
floor assembly. 



The sills were reinforced specifically for the Convertible in orderto be able to absorb the 
forces in the event of a side crash and to direct them to the opposite side of the impact. 

The roof frame in the area of the windscreen has been reinforced and forms the rollover 
protection system together with the roll bars integrated in the partition module. 

In the event of a crash, in which the vehicle rolls over, the roll bars extend in milliseconds 
and, together with the roof frame, form an adequate survival space forthe occupants. 

The E93 Convertible is equipped with a passive safety system with rollover protection. 

In the event of a crash, in which the vehicle rolls over, the roll bars extend automatically 
and, together with the windscreen frame form an adequate survival space forthe 
occupants. 

The rollover sensor system is integrated in the crash safety module. The actuators are 
triggered by the ROC control unit. In the event of a side crash, an enlarged side airbag 
located in the backrest protects the thorax and head of the occupants. 


58 

E93 Electronic Systems 


Advanced C rash and Safety Management 

The E93 Convertible is equipped with the second generation advanced crash and safety 
management system (ACSM 2). In terms of its scope of functions, the ACSM 2 is identi¬ 
cal to the ACSM in the E64 Convertible. 

The ACSM 2 differs from the ACSM inthatthe supplier is different and itfeatures 
additional interfaces for future function expansions. The first generation ACSM is 
supplied by Autoliv while the second generation ACSM is supplied by BOSCH. 

The task of Advanced Crash and Safety M anagement is to evaluate permanently all the 
sensorsignals in orderto identify a crash situation. As a result of the sensor signals and 
their evaluation, the crash safety module identifies the direction of the crash and the 
severity of the impact. 

The crash safety module incorporates a longitudinal acceleration sensor and a transverse 
acceleration sensor. The sensors serve to detect and verify front-end, side-on and 
rear-end crashes. 



In the E93 Convertible the crash safety module has additional sensors for rollover 
detection. 

Satellites are also integrated in the B-pillars. The satellites each consist of a longitudinal 
acceleration sensor and a transverse acceleration sensor. 

Together with the transverse acceleration sensor in the crash safety module, the 
transverse acceleration sensors serve to detect side-on crashes. Door pressure sensors 
are additionally installed in the front doors forthe purpose of detecting side crashes. 

Together with the longitudinal acceleration sensor in the crash safety module, the 
longitudinal acceleration sensors serve to detect front and rear-end crashes. 


59 

E93 Electronic Systems 














The acceleration sensors measure the positive acceleration (+) and the negative 
acceleration (- / deceleration) in the X and Y directions. The resultant from the X and Y 
signals is the definitive factor in determining the direction of the impact. 

US vehicles have additional up-front sensors forfront-end crash detection. 

Also included is information on the occupants and whetherthey have their seat belts 
fastened or not. From this information, measures are taken to selectively trigger the 
necessary restraint systems. 

In orderto ensure ACSM operational availability at all times, the system monitors itself 
and indicates that it is ready for operation when the airbag warning lamp (AWL) goes out. 

If a fault occurs during operation, this is stored in a fault memory, which can then be read 
out for diagnostic purposes. 

In the event of a crash, this is communicated to the other users in the bus-system net¬ 
work by way of a bus telegram. The relevant control units respond to this telegram by exe¬ 
cuting their own activities. 

These activities include: 

• Opening the central-locking system 

• Activating the hazard warning flashers 

• Switching on the interior lights 

• Deactivating the fuel pump 

• Switching offthe alternator 

• Automatic emergency call.

E93 Convertible Rollover Protection System 

The rollover protection system is of vital importance to the passive safety of the E93 
Convertible. The rollover protection system helps to maintain a sufficient survival space 
for the occupants in the event of the car overturning or rolling over. 



There are different factors which can cause a carto overturn or roll over. The most 
common causes are: 

• The car hits a ramp (e.g. a crash barrier) on one side. The car rotates about its 
longitudinal axis as a result of the high angular velocity. 

• The car skids sideways off the road surface and buries itself with its wheels in the 
soft soil. The kinetic energy could be sufficient to upend and overturn the car. 

• The car skids sideways off the road into the curb and is upended. 

The crucial factors which determine whetherthe car overturns are not just the angle but 
also the angular velocity at which the car is set into the roll. All these vehicle movements 
can also occur after a front-end, side-on or rear-end crash. 

The rollover protection system consists of two extendable roll bars which are housed in 
the partition module behind the two rear seats. 

Rollover Detection 

The E93 Convertible has a special sensorsystem in the crash and safety module 
ACSM2 forthe purpose of detecting rollover situations. In addition ofthetwo sensors (4) 
for longitudinal (X-axis) and transverse acceleration (Y-axis), there is a rotation rate sensor 
(2) and a Low-g sensor (3) forthe Z-axis and forthe Y-axis. 

The longitudinal and transverse acceleration sensors (4) registerthe positive and negative 
vehicle acceleration in a range from 0-100 g. They serve to detect heavy accelerations 
and decelerations in a crash. 


64 

E93 Electronic Systems 




The two Low-g sensors (3) have a small measuring range of 0-2 g and can therefore 
detect small accelerations and decelerations with great accuracy. For example, when the 
vehicle skids sideways off the road surface and buries itself with its wheels in soft ground. 

The sensors provide a voltage as measured variable. This voltage is a measure for the 
acceleration and is converted directly into digital signals in the sensor. The digital values 
are sent to the processorfor evaluation. 

The processor evaluates the signals from the longitudinal and transverse acceleration 
sensors and the two Low-g sensors. The rotation rate sensor is also included in the 
calculation.The results are compared with the stored algorithm. When the processor 
detects that a rollover is imminent, it sends two telegrams within a defined timeframe to 
the ROC control unit with the instruction to triggerthe actuators.

voltage regulator (8), the microprocessor (10) and the switching controller (4) are supplied 
with voltage. The switching controller transforms the voltage into 35 V and charges up 
the two firing capacitors (3). 

When the processor in the crash safety module detects an imminent rollover, it sends two 
telegrams within a defined time window via the K-bus. 


The first telegram instructs the ROC control unit to make itself ready forfiring (arming 
telegram). The ROC control unit incorporates two firing capacitors (3) connected in 
parallel for providing the firing energy. Each actuator has one high-side and one low-side 
power circuit-breaker.

The second telegram contains the firing command (firing telegram). The low-side power 
circuit-breakers (6) are connected to ground and the two high-side power circuit breakers 
(2) are switched through. The ROC control unit now discharges the two firing capacitors 
and the two actuators are supplied with voltage. 

During normal operation, the roll bars are inserted in the cassettes in the partition mod¬ 
ule. They are pre-tensioned in the direction of their extension by a spring and held in 
place by a lock on the actuator.

The ROC control unit activates the two actuators via the output stages. Each actuator 
consists of a single-acting solenoid with a lock for disengaging and engaging its roll bar. 
The solenoid actuates the lock and releases the spring-loaded roll bar. 

The locking pawls on the roll bar press the toothed rack back mechanically as the bar 
extends. When the protection bar is extended, the locking pawls are supported on the 
tooth strip. When the car is in the overturned position, the force is transmitted via the 
locking pawls on the roll bars to the toothed rack. 

The rollover protection system may be triggered as follows: 

• Automatically when an imminent rollover situation is detected 

• By a defined crash severity in a front-end, side-on or rear-end crash 

• Via the diagnostic interface 

• By a mechanical emergency release mechanism. 

In orderto return the triggered roll bar back into its initial position, it is necessary 
to press the toothed strap back so that the bar can be pushed in. 

Triggering the Rollover Protection System (via diagnosis equipment) 

To check the function of the rollover protection system, it is necessary to trigger the sys¬ 
tem using the diagnostic equipment. The output stages of the actuators are activated 
here with the aid of a test module. 

It is absolutely essential to observe the following safety precautions: 

• Open the hardtop otherwise the rearwindow will be damaged 

• Make sure no-one is situated in the immediate vicinity of the roll bars. 

Mechanical Emergency Release 

The rollover protection system should be triggered if it has to be removed for repair work. 
If this cannot be done electrically, e.g. for repair work following an accident, the system 
must be triggered mechanically in orderto avoid the risk of injury. 

Follow the procedure set out below: 

• Open the hardtop otherwise the rearwindow will be damaged 

• Remove rear seat 

• Remove partition panel 

• Remove control units underthe roll bar cassette 

• Remove control unit carrier 

• Use a hook (0 3 mm) to reach the actuator 

• The actuator has an opening in the middle, by means 
of which the roll bar can be triggered using the hook.

Crash Safety Module 

The crash safety module is located centrally on the transmission tunnel in the vehicle. 
The crash safety module consists of a diecast housing with integrated plug cover. 

It contains two acceleration sensors offset at an angle of 90°. These acceleration 
sensors measure the longitudinal acceleration and transverse acceleration of the vehicle. 

A rotation rate sensor as well as a Low-g sensor for transverse acceleration (Y direction) 
and a Low-g sensorforZ-direction are additionally integrated for detecting rollover 
situations. 




Crash Safety Module (ACSM 2) 


ROC Control Unit 

In the E93 Convertible, advanced crash and safety management is equipped with an 
additional ROC control unit (rollover controller). The ROC control unit is connected via a 
K-bus to the crash safety module. 

The task of the ROC control unit is to activate the actuators of the rollover protection 
system in the event of an imminent rollover situation. 

Rollover detection takes place in the crash safety module. Two telegrams are sent to the 
ROC control unit when the threshold values are reached. 

The ROC control unit is mounted on the carrier structure of the rollover protection 
systems behind the rear right seat. 

There are a few particulars to be borne in mind in relation to diagnosis forthe ROC 
control unit.

E93 Electronic Systems 



















The ROC (1) control module is not directly 
diagnosis-compatible. The ROC control unit 
monitors itself internally. The two circuits for 
the actuators are also monitored by the ROC. 

In the event of a fault, the ROC transmits the 
fault to the ACS M2 crash safety module, 
where the fault is stored in the fault memory. 
ACS M2 activates the airbag warning lamp in 
the instrument cluster. 


Airbag Systems 

In addition to the known two-stage driver's and passenger's airbag, newly designed side 
airbags are used in the E93. The side airbags are integrated in the backrest of the SGS 
seat. 



The side airbags have a larger volume compared to the airbags previously used. The side 
airbag develops between the seat and door in the event of side impact of sufficient 
severity. Due to the increased volume, the occupant's thorax and head are additionally 
protected.

Design features of the E93 Convertible include the pronounced inclination ofthe wind¬ 
screen with the windscreen cowl panel extending further towards the rear. Knee airbags 
are additionally fitted in US vehicles to conform to US legal requirements for protecting 
occupants not wearing seatbelts. 

The knee airbags substantially reduce displacement ofthe pelvis and initiate upper body 
rotation earlier in the event of an accident, thus preventing occupant contact with the sun 
visor on the windscreen cowl panel. When the ACSM 2 detects that the front passenger 
seat is not occupied, the knee airbag on the passenger's side will not be triggered in the 
event of a crash.
