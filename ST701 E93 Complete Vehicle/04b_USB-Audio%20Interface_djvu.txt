USB/Audio Interface 


Introduction 


Option SA 6FL, "USB/Audio interface", enables the sound systems in BMW vehicles to 
play audio files stored on mass storage devices with a USB (Universal Serial Bus) inter¬ 
face, e.g. USB memory sticks. A special iPod adapter cable is available for connecting an 
Apple iPod. 

USB is a serial bus system used for quick and easy connection of terminal devices to 
computers. 

The mass storage device can be accessed from the "Entertainment" menu on the 
i Drive. 

The CID supports alphanumeric characters ofthe Roman character set. Other character 
sets cannot be correctly represented on the CID at present. 

Operation is described in the owner's handbookforthe vehicle.

USB/Audio Interface 














USB mass storage devices that support the "USB Mass Storage Class" standard can be 
connected. That includes mass storage devices for playback of compressed audio files 
with a USB interface such as MP3 players, USB memory sticks, etc. The system also 
supports Apple iPods of the 4th generation or later, iPod nano and iPod mini if connected 
using the iPod adapter cable (special accessory). 

Due to the large number of devices on the market, no guarantee can be given that every 
available "USB Mass Storage Class" device will function through the USB interface. If a 
device of a different device class is connected, the message "Incompatible device" 
appears. 

When a USB mass storage device is connected, the contents of the device are read and 
the folder structure processed for display on the CID. In addition, a plausibility check is 
performed as to whether the tracks can be played by the vehicle's sound system. Only 
those tracks that can be played are displayed. 

Processing of the data takes some time. While the database of the content details of the 
music tracks is constructed, the music files can only be selected by navigating through 
the folder structure. On completion of the database, music tracks can also be selected by 
genre, artist and album. 

Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is not supported at present. MP3 players that carry the 
PlaysForSure logo use MTP and are therefore not supported. More information on the 
protocols used can be obtained from the operating instructions ofthe mass storage 
device concerned. 

Note: Connecting mobile phones to the USB interface is not recommended. 

With certain mobile phones, B luetooth is deactivated if they are connect¬ 
ed to the vehicle through the USB interface. There is no USB socket on 
the Snap-in adapter. 

USB hard drives must not be connected to the USB interface due to their 
high power draw. It is not permissible for hard disks to draw their power 
supply from the vehicle's electrical system (e.g. from the cigarette lighter 
socket) and can cause faults. 

The following compressed file formats are normally supported 
with fixed and variable bit rates: 

• MP3 (M PEG-1 Audio Layer3) with ID3 tags Version 2 

• Windows M edia Audio (WM A) with WM A tags 

• Advanced Audio Coding (AAC).

USB/Audio Interface 



The WAV file format is also supported. USB mass storage devices must be formatted 
using the FAT file system. If more than one partition (logical drive) has been set up on the 
device, only the first partition is supported. 

The USB mass storage device cannot be accessed if the files are password-protected or 
are subject to Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM is a method of protecting copy¬ 
right and marketing rights relating to intellectual property in digital form. 

If music tracks acquired from Apple iTunes are to be played, the iPod must be connected 
by means of an adapter cable that simultaneously uses the jack socket and the USB. The 
adapter cable is available to orderfrom BMW Parts Sales. 

With the adapter cable, the USB connection is used to control the iPod and the jack 
socket for audio playback.The reason forthis method of connection is that music tracks 
obtained from iTunes are subject to DRM and can only be played on the device to which 
they were downloaded. The copyright protection prevents digital transmission of the 
music track via USB. 

If a video file is selected on the iPod, only the sound track is played. If other supported 
USB mass storage devices are used, video files are not displayed. 

It is only possible to access the files on the mass storage device using the iDrive when 
the USB mass storage device is connected to the USB interface. If the mass storage 
device is connected using the jack plug, the iDrive cannot be used to operate the device.

Components 


Option SA 6FL, "USB/Audio interface" consists of the following components: 

• High interface box (SBX High) 

• USB hub 


• Audio socket with USB interface 

• Application software on the head unit. 

The USB interface is on the center console and is protected by a slider mechanism. 


To prevent earth loops, simultaneous use of the USB interface and the 12 V socket for 
charging the mass storage device is not recommended. Dependent on the USB lead 
used, the mass storage device may be able to be charged through the USB interface. 
However, the power consumption of the mass storage device must not exceed the 
maximum level of 500 mA permitted by the SBX High.

USB/Audio Interface 









The High interface box (SBX High) performs the following tasks: 

• USB connection for USB/audio interface 

• Bluetooth signal connection for customer's mobile phone (dealt with in "E70 
Telephone Systems" Product Information) 

• Voice input system (dealt with in "Voice input and activation systems E70" 

Product Information) 

The High interface box is always fitted if option SA 6FL, "USB/Audio interface", is fitted to 
the vehicle. It decodes the digital audio signals that are supplied via the USB interface. 
After decoding, the audio files are broadcast via the MOST. In addition, the analogue LF 
signals from the audio socket are also broadcast on the M OST. 

Software (drivers) cannot be uploaded to the SBX High via the USB interface. 

The SBX High supports USB 1.1 with the following specifications: 

• M aximum data rate: 12 M bit/s 

• Voltage: 5 V 

• Current: 500 mA. 

The SBX High is located in the luggage compartment on the left-hand side.

Audio J ack 

The audio socket is used for connecting an external audio source such as an MP3, 
cassette or CD player using a 3.5 mm jack plug. The audio socket (Aux In) without USB 
interface is standard equipment on the E70. It is located below the center armrest. 

A 12 volt power socket is located in the immediate vicinity of the audio socket.

Service Information 


Included with the option code 6FL (USB/Audio Interface) is a cable that is required to 
fully integrate an Apple iPod to the vehicle. 

This cable allows the data files and incompatible audio files to be masked in the CID. 
Only compatible audio files will be displayed if this interface cable is used.
