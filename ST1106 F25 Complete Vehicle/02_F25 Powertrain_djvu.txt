2.3.2. Engine identification 

The engines have an identification mark on the crankcase to ensure proper identification and classifi¬ 
cation. 

This engine identification is also necessary for approval by government authorities. With the N55 en¬ 
gine, this identification has been subject to a further development, with the previous eight positions 
being reduced to seven. The engine number can be found on the engine below the engine identifi¬ 
cation. This consecutive number, in conjunction with the engine identification, permits unambiguous 
identification of each individual engine.

3.3. GA8HP transmission 

The F25 features the new automatic transmission GA8HP45Z with eight forward gears and one re¬ 
verse gear.

F25 Powertrain 
3. Automatic transmission 



Highlights 

• Significantly enhanced spontaneity of the gear shifts 

• Greater driving and shifting comfort as a result of smaller gear jumps 

• Higher control precision of the converter lockup clutch at low engine loads 

• High power transmission of the converter lockup clutch 

• Reduced fuel consumption (-5 to -6%). 

The GA8HP45Z is a new development which will gradually supersede the established GA6HP19Z TU 
or GA6HP26Z TU 6-speed automatic transmission. The overall gear ratio has been enlarged from 6.04 
to 7.07; the gear jumps have become smaller, thus also reducing the differences in speed when shift¬ 
ing gear. The weight of the transmission has been reduced significantly using, among other things, a 
plastic oil pan. 

The Electronic Transmission Control (EGS) control unit is integrated in the control unit framework of 
the electronic immobilizer EWS. This provides better protection against theft. 

It is operated via the gear selector switch. 

The torque converter contains second generation mechanical torsional vibration dampers: 


Turbine torsional vibration damper, TTD 
Two-damper torque converter, ZDW. 


9 



F25 Powertrain 
3. Automatic transmission 


The function and design of the converter is described in the Automatic transmission section of ST605 
E70 X5 training material. 

The vibration isolation reduces the proportion of slip on the converter lockup clutch and enables a 
larger operating range with the converter lockup clutch closed. This reduces the fuel consumption by 
5% to 6% in the consumption cycle (KV01) compared to the TU six-speed automatic transmissions 
used until now.

3.4.2. Electronic transmission emergency release 

A_ 

The electronic transmission emergency release may only be operated by specially trained Service per¬ 
sonnel. 

If the electronic transmission emergency release is operated, the vehicle must only be maneuvered 
and not towed. In the event of misuse, an entry is made in the fault memory. 


A 

The electronic transmission emergency release can only be used if the engine does not start but the 
starter still cranks. 

The electronic transmission emergency release is only active for fifteen minutes. As soon as a wheel 
speed signal is detected, the time extended an additional fifteen minutes. After this period elapses, 
the parking lock is engaged without a Check Control message being displayed. The specified time de¬ 
pends on the condition of the battery. 


Before operating the electronic transmission emergency release, secure the vehicle to prevent 
it from rolling 

Depress and hold the brake pedal throughout the entire process 

Press the start/stop button - the starter motor will crank for a specific amount of time

The ATC450 transfer case is a further development of the ATC 400 used in the predecessor E83. 

Highlights 

• Approx. 2 kg weight reduction 

• Optimized efficiency 

• Cost efficient. 

The overall efficiency has been improved through the following: 

• Integration of printed circuit board and servomotor in the transfer case (VTG) control unit 

• Omission of mechanical oil pump 

• Lubrication and cooling of components via the oil supply function of the chain drive 

• Reduction in number of components of actuator mechanism 

• minimization of mechanical tolerances. 


4.3.2. Power flow 

The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) activates the fully-variable torque distribution between the front 
axle differential and rear axle final drive. The required nominal torque at the multidisc clutch of the 
transfer case is adjusted via the integrated control unit of the transfer case (VTG). This process is sub¬ 
ject to correction functions in relation to the wear and run-in behavior in order to ensure optimum posi¬ 
tioning accuracy throughout the entire service life. Continuous ongoing calculation of thermal loading 
models in the control unit of the transfer case (VTG) protect the transfer case from destruction as a re¬ 
sult of overheating. 

The variable distribution of torque to the front axle is superimposed on the rigid through drive to the 
rear axle. 

When the multidisc clutch is open, the entire drive torque is transmitted to the rear axle final drive 
(0/100%). If the multidisc clutch in the transfer case is activated, the drive torque will normally be dis¬ 
tributed between the front and rear axle according to the BMW-typical characteristic (40/60%). 

Due to the xDrive functionality in the DSC, the torque distribution between axles can also be varied ar¬ 
bitrarily depending on the driving conditions (in response to different road surface coefficients of fric¬ 
tion). For more information on the xDrive functionality, refer to the "F25 chassis and suspension train¬ 
ing material.

Chain drive between rear and front axle, if multidisc clutch is closed 


The transfer case (VTG) control unit module, consisting of electric motor and control unit PCB, trans¬ 
fers the torque to the toothed actuator ring (4) via the worm gear wheel shaft (5). This in turn converts 
the torque into an axial force via the ball ramp system which compresses the multidisc clutch set (2) via 
a piston. The higher the applied axial force is, the more torque is diverted from the main gear (1) via the 
chain drive (7) to the front axle flange (6) and the front axle. 


17 











F25 Powertrain 
4. Drivetrain 


If the multidisc clutch is fully open, the entire input torque is transmitted to the rear axle flange (3) via 
the direct connection driveshaft. 

4.3.4. Specific mechanism 



Spiral-toothed gearwheel drive with ball ramp 


Index 

Explanation 

1 

“Sprial-toothed” worm gear/wheel drive - the servomotor turns the worm gear/ 
wheel which causes radial movement of the ball ramp 

2 

Ball ramp - converts the control lever's radial movement into axial piston 
movement in order to apply the multidisc clutch and transfer the torque to the 
front axle

4.4. Rear axle final drive 

The rear axle final drive has a spheroidal graphite cast iron housing (GGG40). Already used in the E70 
and E90 but has been developed further for the F25. The HAG 188LW rear axle final drive is available 
in two gear ratios depending on the engine variant installed.

F25 Low-friction rear axle final drive 


4.4.1. Highlights 

• Weight: 28.5 kg (incl. 0.8I oil) 

• Reduced transfer losses 

• Optimized efficiency (approx. 1%). 

Efficiency has been improved through the following: 

• Use of oil with a lower viscosity 

• The material of the radial shaft seals has been modified 

• Optimized lubrication of pinion bearing 

• The ring gear is welded to differential housing instead of bolted. 


4.4.2. Designation

4.5. Driveshafts 

4.5.1. Overview 

Both models of The F25 use a steel driveshaft. 

Focal points in the design of the driveshafts were the torque transfer and comfort requirements with 
regard to acoustics and vibrations. 

The universal joints, shaft divisions and shaft diameters have been specified in such a way that they do 
not transmit any disruptive noises or vibrations to the connection points at the body. 

The driveshafts of the F25 are connected to the transfer case with a flexible disc and to the rear axle fi¬ 
nal drive with universal joint.

4.5.2. Collapsing element 

The driveshaft is equipped with a collapsing element (integrated in the front driveshaft tube) which is 
designed to absorb some of the deformation energy in the event of a head-on collision. This device re¬ 
duces the load on the occupants and increases passive safety. 

The properties of this collapsing element have been enhanced for the F25. Although the capability to 
transfer torque has remained unchanged, the spring force which deforms the front driveshaft tube in 
the event of a head-on collision has been reduced. 


4.6. Output shafts, front axle 

The front output shafts transfer the torque to the front wheels. The movement of the assemblies (en¬ 
gine/transmission, bearings, rear axle) along with the spring travel of the wheels and angle changes in 
the drivetrain must be balanced out during this process. 

The front output shafts in an xDrive vehicle must take up large deflection angles caused by the steer¬ 
ing angle at the wheel hubs. The output shafts must also be capable of transferring the maximum 
torque applied to them. 

Up till now, output shaft journals with longitudinal splines have been used for the axle to wheel hub 
connection. In the F25, this connection is made by machining spur gears on both the axle and the 
wheel hub mating surfaces. When these components are then torqued to specifications the result is 
comparable to the conventional spline method. This system (first introduced in the EU with the E84 
XI) simplifies the installation of the drivetrain at the assembly plant and reduces manufacturing costs.

4.7. Output shafts, rear axle 

Conventional output shafts with longitudinal splines are used at the rear axle of the F25. 

The positioning of the rear axle final drive means the left and right output shafts have different overall 
lengths.
