2.2. Special features 

The vehicle electrical system of the F25 is based on the F01 (vehicle electrical system BN2020). 

FlexRay is also used in the F25 as the system bus for networking of the systems that control the dy¬ 
namic handling characteristics and engine control. The central gateway module ZGM contains a so- 
called star coupler with three bus drives. The bus drivers forward the data of the control units via the 
communication controller to the central gateway module (ZGM). The FlexRay control units are con¬ 
nected to these bus drivers. 

To avoid reflections on the lines, both ends of the data lines are terminated with resistors (as bus ter¬ 
mination). 

The F25 has Ethernet access in order to be able to program the complete vehicle quickly. It has been 
possible to eliminate access via the Media Oriented System Transport bus system for programming 
purposes thanks to the extremely high data transfer rate of the Ethernet (100 MBit/s). 

The body controller area network 2 (K-CAN2) facilitates communication between control units with 
a high data transfer rate (500 kBit/s). The K-CAN2 is also connected to the other bus systems via the 
central gateway module ZGM. 

The Powertrain Controller Area Network 2 (PT-CAN2) serves as a redundant system for the Powertrain 
Controller Area Network (PT-CAN) in the area of engine and transmission control and also to forward 
signals to the electric fuel pump.

3. Voltage supply 

The voltage supply concept of the F25 is based on current BMW models. The components and layout 
used are essentially the same. 

3.1. Components 

Due to the steady increase of electrical functions for comfort, communication and safety in BMW vehi¬ 
cles, the voltage supply is becoming ever more important. 

Five separate power distribution boxes with fuse blocks are installed in the F25: 

• Engine compartment power distribution box with capacitor 

• Power Distribution Module PDM at brake servo 

• Junction box for the power distribution box in the vicinity of the glove box 

• Luggage compartment power distribution box on right-hand side of the luggage compartment 

• Battery power distribution box. 

The junction box comprises the junction box power distribution box and junction box electronics JBE.

Battery 


Two main power lines are routed along the vehicle underbody of the F25 from the luggage compart¬ 
ment to the engine compartment: 

• One of the main power lines runs from the safety battery terminal (SBK) to the starter motor 
and alternator via the engine compartment power distribution box and positive battery con¬ 
nection point. 

Copper cable with a cross-section of 50 mm 2 is used up to the transition point below the lug¬ 
gage compartment floor from where round aluminium cable with a cross-section of 80 mm 2 is 
used. 

• The second main power line runs from the power distribution box on the battery to the Power 
Distribution Module (PDM) and is a copper cable with a cross-section of 16 mm 2 . 

Two additional battery cables run through the vehicle interior to the luggage compartment power dis¬ 
tribution box and junction box for power distribution box. 

3.1.1. Battery 

Voltage in the F25 is always supplied by an AGM (absorbent glass matt) battery. The vehicle battery is 
installed at the rear of the luggage compartment in the center. Two different AGM battery ratings are 
used, depending on equipment level. 

• 90 Ah 

• 105 Ah

AGM battery 


With the introduction of the FI 0, the intelligent battery sensor (IBS) was used to improve the battery 
condition detection. The following criteria are used to establish whether or not the battery in the F25 is 
defective and needs to be replaced: 

• Identification of faulty battery cells in the vehicle battery 

• Establishing the remaining capacity of the vehicle battery 

• Battery water loss detected 

• Long immobilization period with low state of charge 

• Charge capacity 

• Charge balance when the vehicle is at a standstill 

• Charge balance when the vehicle is moving 

• Lowest permitted discharging 

These criteria are recorded using the measured values obtained from the intelligent battery sensor and 
other measured variables of the voltage supply. Only specific criteria may be used to determine the 
battery condition, depending on the driving style and equipment used in the vehicle.

The battery condition detection determines whether the battery needs to be replaced based on the 
severity and number of defects detected. Furthermore, the vehicle user is notified via the "Check pow¬ 
er supply" check control message that a problem may exist. The fault entry can only be deleted once 
the vehicle battery change service function has been carried out. 

The condition of the battery can be read out in Service via the "battery condition" or "energy diagno¬ 
sis" procedures ("General information / battery" menu) in order to determine whether it needs to be re¬ 
placed.

3.3. Energy management 

The F25 energy management has been extended to include a number of functions.

F25 General Vehicle Electronics 

3. Voltage supply 


3.3.1. Charge condition display 

If the F25 is in transport mode, the battery's state of charge is continuously displayed when in opera¬ 
tion. The carrier can therefore charge the battery on time in order to prevent deep discharging of the 
battery, and therefore damage to the battery. 

3.3.2. Influence of steering power 

The power consumption of the electromechanical power steering (EPS) is extremely high. In order to 
avoid a brief reduction in the steering servo availability, the energy management of the F25 anticipates 
and responds to steering-intensive driving maneuvers (parking or three-point turns). To do this, specif¬ 
ic input variables (e.g. vehicle speed, brake pedal operation and steering angle) are evaluated. The en¬ 
ergy management can implement the following measures: 

• Raise the idling speed and adjust the ignition timing to increase the engine torque 

• Increase the vehicle voltage via the alternator 

• Turn off convenience functions (heated rear window, outside mirror heating system and seat 
heating). 


3.3.3. Power distribution box in engine compartment 

A capacitor is installed in the power distribution box in the engine compartment to reduce the AC rip¬ 
ple in the vehicle voltage caused by the alternator.

If a faulty electric fan fails, the harmonic content of the voltage must also be measured using a test 
plan in ISTA. If the harmonic content is determined to be too high, this indicates that a capacitor is also 
faulty and must be replaced.

3.4. Supply to EPS 

The electromechanical power steering (EPS) is installed in all F25 xDrive vehicles. 

EPS can reduce fuel consumption by roughly 3% on average when compared to conventional hy¬ 
draulic steering. This contributes towards a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

4. Car Access System 

The F25 uses the forth generation Car Access System (CAS 4). Associated with that is complete inte¬ 
gration of the Comfort Access functions in the Car Access System. 

As of series introduction, the drive authorization (Passive Go) system is fitted as standard equipment in 
the F25. Drive authorization allows the customer to start the engine without actively using the ID trans¬ 
mitter. The ID transmitter only needs to be somewhere inside the passenger compartment for the en¬ 
gine to be started. 

An ID transmitter consists of: 

• A battery 

• Remote control function 

• Transponder coil for emergency start function 

• Spare key 

• Receiver unit. 

The battery has a service life of approx, four years. Up to eight ID transmitters can be used for a partic¬ 
ular vehicle.

4. Car Access System 

4.2. Overview of functions 

The Car Access System is, among other functions, the central control unit for accessing and locking 
the vehicle. The Car Access System has complete control over the central locking system. 

The Car Access System incorporates the following functions for the F25: 

• Comfort Access 

• Central locking system 

• Power window operation 

• Panorama glass roof 

• Terminal control 

• Electronic immobilizer. 

Other functions of the Car Access System include: 

• Vehicle data storage 

• Data transfer for Conditioned Based Service (CBS) 

• Plausibility check of signals from ID transmitter. 

Various functions are released or suppressed by the Car Access System. However, other control units 
are involved in actually carrying out these functions: 

• Junction box electronics (JBE) 

• Footwell module (FRM) 

• Roof function center (FZD) 

For the purposes of communication with other components of the vehicle electrical system, the Car 
Access System is connected to the K-CAN2, CAS bus and local interconnect network bus. 

The Car Access System analyses the status of the engine compartment lid contact switch and broad¬ 
casts it for use by the alarm system. 

The Car Access System also monitors the status of the following buttons and initiates the central lock¬ 
ing function. 

• Central locking system button on dashboard 

• Tailgate push button on A-pillar 

• Button for central locking system on inside of tailgate. 

The Car Access System supplies voltage to the brake light switch and monitors its status. 

An ID transmitter must be located in the passenger compartment in order for the engine to be started. 
The engine can now be started by pressing the start/stop button with the brake pedal pressed and the 
vehicle is operational. 

Note: For more a complete description of the functions, please refer to the F01/F02 training 
information available on TIS and ICP. 


20 




F25 General Vehicle Electronics 

5. Comfort Access 


Using Comfort Access, the customer can unlock and open the vehicle without active use of the ID 
transmitter. Access to the vehicle can be gained from any point. It is sufficient if the ID transmitter is in 
the immediate vicinity (within a range of approx. 1.5 m) of the vehicle. 

The F25 is available with Comfort Access as optional equipment (SA 322). 

The benefits of Comfort Access are: 

• High level of operating convenience when unlocking and locking the vehicle 

• Convenient and fast access to the vehicle 

• Simple engine start/shutdown procedure 

• Maximum comfort for the driver. 

The Comfort Access in the F25 is based on previous systems and is adapted to the F25. As is the 
case with current BMW models, the entire function is incorporated into the Car Access System, which 
means the F25 also has no separate Comfort Access control unit. 

If the ID transmitter has been detected and a door handle has been touched on one of the front doors, 
the vehicle unlocks and can then be opened by pulling the outer door handle. 

If the ID transmitter is outside the vehicle and the sensitive surface on the outer door handle of one of 
the front doors is touched, the vehicle locks. 

Comfort Access is divided into the following functions: 

• Access authorization (Passive Entry) 

• Drive authorization (Passive Go) 

• Locking authorization (Passive Exit). 

For more a complete description of these functions, please refer to the F01/F02 Comfort Access Sys¬ 
tem training material available on TIS and ICR

6. Central locking system 

The central locking system locks and unlocks all doors, the fuel filler flap and tailgate centrally. It is in¬ 
stalled in the F25 as standard and can be operated via the following components: 

• ID transmitter 

• Driver's door lock barrel (door lock) 

• Outer door handle (outside door handle electronics only with Comfort Access, SA 322) 

• Button for central locking system on dashboard 

• Button for central locking system on inside of tailgate (only with Comfort Access, SA 322). 

• Tailgate push button on A-pillar (only with automatic tailgate activation, SA 316) 

• Tailgate push button on the outside of the tailgate 

• Tailgate push button on the inside of tailgate (only with automatic tailgate activation, SA 316). 
The F25 has no lock in the tailgate for unlocking the vehicle using the mechanical or spare key. 

The tailgate lock can be unlocked manually from the inside of the luggage compartment. The unlock¬ 
ing lever is on the underside of the system lock. The system lock can be accessed by removing the lin¬ 
ing of the luggage compartment floor. 

The central locking system in the F25 is based on the familiar central locking system already used in, 
for instance, the E70, E90 or F01.

6.2. Overview of functions 

The function of the central locking system is basically divided between two control units. 

• The Car Access System has overall control. The Car Access System is aware of the system 
statuses of the central locking system. Therefore it is the Car Access System which authorizes 
the unlocking, locking and deadlocking of the vehicle. 

• The junction box electronics executes the requests to unlock or lock the vehicle. 

It is possible to unlock and lock the vehicle actively or passively. 

Active means that the vehicle can be opened after it has been unlocked by a press of the button on 
the ID transmitter. The vehicle can be locked by pressing the Lock button after the doors have been 
closed. 

A 

Note: The vehicle can only be locked with the driver's door closed.

6. Central locking system 

Passive locking and unlocking requires the optional equipment Comfort Access (SA 322). 

Passive means the vehicle is unlocked when the outer door handle is grasped, provided the ID trans¬ 
mitter is no more than approx. 1.5 metres from the vehicle. The locking operation is activated by 
touching the sensitive surface on the outer door handle.

7.3. Examples of the signal path 

The following examples show the signal paths prior to opening or closing of the side windows by the 
power window motors. As a prerequisite, operation of the power windows must have been enabled by 
the Car Access System. 

7.3.1. Switch block, driver's door 

If the front left or front right power window switch is pressed, the signal is routed to the footwell mod¬ 
ule via the local interconnect network bus. The footwell module drives the corresponding power win¬ 
dow motor. 

If the rear left or rear right power window switch is pressed, the signal from the switch block in the 
driver's door is routed to the footwell module via the local interconnect network bus. The footwell 
module sends the signal via the body controller area network 2 to the junction box electronics. The 
junction box electronics controls the relevant power window motor.

9. Alarm system 

The alarm system DWA is to indicate when the vehicle is accessed without authorization by emitting 
an alarm. The alarm can be triggered both audibly and visually. To do this, the alarm system must be 
activated. When activated, the alarm system monitors the whole of the vehicle interior. 

In addition the alarm system monitors the engine compartment it also monitors all 4 doors and tailgate. 

The alarm system also signals when an attempt is made to tamper with the vehicle, e.g. by cutting 
through the feed line to the siren with tilt alarm sensor SINE. 

The alarm system's ultrasonic interior movement detector is integrated into the roof function center 
FZD. The ultrasound waves pass into the inside of vehicle through openings in the grille of the roof 
function center. 

The siren with tilt alarm sensor SINE is located in the area of the front wheel arch. 

For more information on the operating principle of the alarm system, refer to the F01/F02 Anti-theft 
System training manual available on TIS and ICR

10. Automatic operation of tailgate 

The automatic operation of tailgate is available for the F25 from series introduction. It can be ordered 
as optional equipment SA 316 Automatic tailgate activation. 

The automatic operation of tailgate allows the vehicle to be accessed more conveniently by opening or 
closing the tailgate automatically at the push of a button. A spindle-driven system features for the first 
time in the F25 for automatic opening or closing of the tailgate. 

The automatic operation of tailgate is implemented via the following components: 

• Tailgate push-button on the outside of the tailgate 

• ID transmitter 

• Tailgate push-button on A-pillar 

• Tailgate push-button on the inside of the tailgate 

• Button for central locking system on inside of tailgate (only with Comfort Access, SA 322).

If the optional equipment Comfort Access (SA 322) is also fitted in the vehicle, the tailgate can also be 
opened automatically even when the vehicle is locked. To open the vehicle via the tailgate push-button 
on the outside of the tailgate, a suitable ID transmitter must be close to the rear end of the vehicle. 

It is now also possible in conjunction with the Comfort Access (SA 322) to lock the car doors via the 
button for the central locking system on the inside of the tailgate.

1 Button for central locking system on inside of tailgate only available with Comfort Access (SA 322). 


The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the rear window antenna. The remote control re¬ 
ceiver in the antenna diversity module forwards the signal to the Car Access System via the local inter¬ 
connect network bus. The Car Access System is the master control unit for the central locking func¬ 
tion. 

Once the signal has been successfully verified, the Car Access System issues a command to activate 
the central locking system in the tailgate. 

The junction box electronics execute the command to activate the central locking system in the tail¬ 
gate. The status of the tailgate contact for the automatic operation of tailgate function is acquired by 
the junction box electronics and sent to the control unit for the automatic operation of tailgate via the 
body controller area network. The status is one of the triggering criteria for luggage compartment lid 
operation. 

The control unit for the automatic tailgate operation monitors the movement of the tailgate via sensors 
in the spindle drives. It also records the power consumption of the spindle drives. 


41 














F25 General Vehicle Electronics 

10. Automatic operation of tailgate 

If the luggage compartment lid is blocked when closing, it is moved back slightly (reversed) by the au¬ 
tomatic operation of tailgate in order to release the blockage. An obstruction to the tailgate movement 
during opening causes the tailgate to stop and it is not reversed.

13.1.4. Crash-active headrest 

Each of the front seats is equipped with a crash-active headrest. This is a head restraint with a py¬ 
rotechnic actuator that optimizes the distance and height of the headrest in relation to the head if 
a rear-end collision of sufficient force occurs. This reduces the load on the cervical vertebrae in the 
event of a rear-end collision. 

A _ _ 

If the active head restraints have been triggered, the pyrotechnic actuators must be replaced 
in the workshop. Please to refer to the repair instructions. 


A 

Seat or head restraint covers and/or accessories that could impair the protective effect must 
not be mounted on the head restraints.

The head restraints are adjusted via pretensioned tension springs. If the Crash Safety Module detects 
a rear-end collision, the pyrotechnic actuators are energized and the pretensioned tension springs are 
enabled. 


13.2. Rear seats 

The rear seat backrests in the F25 have a 60/40 split as standard. A seat heating system (SA 496) and 
through-loading system with a center section that folds down separately and a 40/20/40 split (SA 465) 
are available as optional equipment.

14. Heating and air conditioning systems 

Integrated automatic climate control IHKA is available for the F25. 

• 2/1-zone IHKA (SA 534) 

The first number denotes the number of controllable temperature zones (temperature selector wheels) 
and the second denotes the number of controllable air volume and air distribution zones (separate fan 
settings). 

Both versions are based on the E83 heating and air conditioning systems.

Highlights 

The F25 features rapid cooling and heating response with a greater degree of comfort in terms of 
acoustics and customizing. 

* Optimized air flow rate 

The entire volume of air in the vehicle can be replaced up to 3 times a minute. 

* Fresh air/recirculation 

Air is filtered through interaction with an automatic air recirculation control sensor which al¬ 
so continuously monitors the quality of the intake air. This ensures that pollutants do not en¬ 
ter the vehicle interior when driving in towns or through tunnels. The incoming fresh air is also 
cleaned by a carbon filter. Air is also filtered in air recirculation mode to prevent soiling of the 
heating and air conditioning system components and vehicle interior and also to ensure hy¬ 
gienic operation of the system. 

* Solar and condensation sensor 

A combination sensor integrated into the mirror base determines the angle of incidence and 
the intensity of solar radiation. This means that the automatic integrated heating and A/C 
control unit IHKA can maintain an even and pleasant temperature in the passenger compart¬ 
ment even when solar radiation is present. The IHKA can reliably prevent fogging of the win¬ 
dow glass through selective control intervention by measuring the surface temperature of the 
windscreen and air humidity.

14. Heating and air conditioning systems 

• Climate styles and layering function 

When the IHKA is in AUTO mode, the customer can adjust the amounts of air according to 
his individual comfort requirements using five different "climate styles" without exiting AUTO 
mode. The ventilation temperature (oncoming flow at upper body) can be adjusted individually 
via the layering function. 

14.2. 2/1-zone IHKA 

The 2/1 -zone IHKA is standard on all F25 models.

The 2/1 -zone IHKA the temperature can be controlled on the left and right side separately. 

The current driver temperature setting can be transferred to the front passenger side by pressing the 
"ALL" button. 


The 2/1 -zone IHKA also features automatic air recirculation control (AUC). This means that fresh air 
containing odors or pollutants is blocked. The interior air is then recirculated.
