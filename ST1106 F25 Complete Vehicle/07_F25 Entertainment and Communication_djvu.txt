Car Information Computer, CIC 


The CIC headunit was installed for the first time in the BMW 1 -Series and 3-Series vehicles in con¬ 
junction with the Navigation system (SA 609). 

A wide range of new options are now available with this headunit including an 8.8-inch high-resolution 
trans-reflective screen that is the largest on-board monitor in its vehicle segment. 

As with the latest CIC systems a hard disk storage capacity of 80 GB is used in combination with the 
Navigation system option. 

With regard to audio system, a 12 GB partition of the total hard drive memory is set aside for the music 
collection function. Music files can be converted (ripped) from CDs or copied from USB drives to the 
music collection on the systems hard drive. Storing these files on the CIC-dedicated hard disk, allows 
for fast and easy access to the customer's music at all times. A selection of up to 3700 music files can 
be stored with the system. 

In contrast with CIC Basic 2 (which has a CD drive) CIC with Navigation incorporates a DVD drive. 

CIC incorporates a double tuner for the FM/AM band, one is used for tuning the other to update the 
station list and station information. The FM/AM double tuner module and the FM-TMC module com¬ 
bine to form the triple tuner. 


The digital radio tuner (IBOC) and satellite tuner (SDARS) radio systems are now integrated into the 
CIC, this mean there is no need to install separate control units for these functions.

CIC Basic 2 


Index 

Explanation

Car information computer basic 2 (CIC Basic 2) 


The car information computer basic 2 CIC Basic 2 (also referred to as "Champ 2") is used in the F25. 
The Radio Professional (SA 663) without navigation system is standard on both variants of the F25. 

In contrast to its predecessors (M-ASK and CFIAMP), the CIC Basic 2 is not equipped with a DVD 
drive. Only a single CD drive is installed in the headunit which means that the CIC Basic 2 only sup¬ 
ports playback of audio files and not DVDs. 

The contacts are now located in a flash memory in the form of an SD memory card with a 2GB capaci¬ 
ty. In the F25, this system is installed in combination with the standard radio without navigation. 

Furthermore, the IBOC and SDARS digital tuners hardware and software functions have been incorpo¬ 
rated into the CIC Basic 2 electronics and thus the range of functions substantially extended. 

The CIC Basic 2 in the F25 can now be ordered for the first time with a built-in hands-free Bluetooth 
system due to the incorporation of the Bluetooth hardware and function into the headunit. 

The CIC Basic 2 option comes with a CID Central Information Display with 6.5" screen. 

A 

Note: The CIC Basic 2 components are not replaceable separately by the BMW Service De¬ 
partment, if defective, it has to be replaced as a complete unit.

3. Speaker systems 

3.1. Overview 



F25 Speaker 


The speaker systems on the F25 are available in two variants: 

• Hi-fi sound system (SA 676) is standard. 

• Top (Premium) HiFi System (SA 677) is optional. 

A seven-channel amplifier with digital equalizing is integrated in the hi-fi system. The amplifier of the 
hi-fi sound system has no bus connection and receives the switch-on signal instead via a separate line. 

The bass speakers are under the front seats. They are coupled to the side sills. That increases the res¬ 
onance volume necessary for bass reproduction. 

The CIC and CIC Basic 2 headunits can be combined with all amplifier/audio speaker systems. 

The hi-fi and Top HiFi systems feature separate speakers for the treble and mid-tone ranges. 

Although the diameters of the speakers in the hi-fi sound system and Top HiFi system are the same, 
the performance of the speakers is different. This is achieved by using different materials for di¬ 
aphragms, coils and magnets. 

The Top HiFi system supports playback of multichannel formats. Multichannel audio formats can be 
played back via the CIC drive or DVD changer for six DVDs. The amplifier of the Top HiFi system has no 
data bus connection and instead receives the switch-on signal via a separate line. 


3.2. Components 


3.2.1. Hi-fi system 

The graphic below shows the hi-fi system speakers and amplifier. The speakers are operated with a 
power output of 5 x 25 watts for the mid-range speakers and tweeters and 2 x 40 watts for the bass 
speakers.

3.2.2. Top HiFi system 

The graphic below shows the Top HiFi system speakers and amplifier. The speakers are operated with 
a power output of 7 x 50 watts for the mid-range speakers and tweeters and 2 x 125 watts for the bass 
speakers. 

The amplifier of the Top HiFi system in the F25 features what is referred to as load-logic separation. In 
this case power is supplied to the amplifier's electronics separately by a line which is connected sep¬ 
arately. This is specially protected against brief voltage dips which in turn prevents failure of the elec¬ 
tronics if a voltage dip occurs briefly.

4.3.1. Compatibility 

The range and diversity of cell phones available on the market is steadily increasing. Not every Blue¬ 
tooth-enabled cell phone is automatically compatible with every hands-free system. To provide the 
customer with a simpler, easy-to-understand overview of the currently “tested” devices, the website at 
http://www.bmwusa.com/bluetooth is being constantly updated. Customers are able to use the web¬ 
site to determine which devices and functions work and which do not with their specific BMW model. 

The customer can now obtain information regarding the compatibility of specific tested cell phones 
with their vehicles (by entering the vehicle VIN number for example). A prospective BMW customer can 
also find out which cell phones have been tested and are compatible with specific BMW models.

4.5.2. Functions 

Audio device via Bluetooth 

The Combox in the F25 allows stereo audio signals to be transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth from a 
suitable audio source. To do this, the audio source must support A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution 
Profile). An audio source can be a cell phone or an MP3 player, for example. The A2DP profile is used 
for transmission of the audio playback signal. 

The AVRCP (Audio Video Remote Control Profile) is used to control the source remotely. The range 
of remote control functions depends on the version of AVRCP supported by the source. The Combox 
supports AVRCP versions 1.0 and 1.3. Version 1.4 of AVRCP is scheduled to be released in 03/2011. 

For best results and to ensure optimum functionality of audio playback via Bluetooth, you should only 
use BMW tested devices. These devices are listed on the Internet page http://www.bmwusa.com/blue- 
tooth 


26 















F25 Entertainment and Communication 

4. Telephone systems 


Multiple Bluetooth pairing 

With the Combox two devices can be connected simultaneously via Bluetooth. That means the audio 
player of one device and the telephone function of another can be connected to the vehicle simultane¬ 
ously. 

The configured function for each device in use is clearly shown by a phone or musical note symbol af¬ 
ter the name of each device on the ’’Add new device” screen. 


When two phones are connected at the same time, one will have full Office functionality (indicated by 
the phone/phone book icon) and the other can be used just for incoming (personal) calls as an “Addi¬ 
tional Telephone”. 


This second or “Additional Telephone” will not display the contacts nor any other Office function. 


This is achieved by highlighting the device and selecting “Additional Telephone” under “Configure 
Phone” feature in the options menu.

Contacts with images 

The Combox in the F25 supports contacts with images. These are transmitted from a compatible cell 
phone via Bluetooth and stored provisionally on the Combox. 

Contacts can be created and edited. The contacts in the cell phone are also displayed providing the 
device supports this function. The addresses can be used as navigation system destinations and the 
phone numbers can be dialed.

Office functions are displayed on the Office sub-menu. 


The customer can use the Office function of the Combox to access the emails, SMS, calendar, notes, 
tasks and reminders, these functions are phone dependent and are only available with a compatible 
“Tested” cell phone. 


The “Office” menu item replaces the “Contacts” item in the central information display regardless if 
the phone supports this function. 

The cell phone supported Office functions will be displayed in the Office sub-menu (some phones will 
only display “Contacts” here). 

Although access to the cell phone is always read-only and the Combox does not modify existing data 
on the phone, once you open a message/email via the iDrive, the status of the message on the phone 
will change to “read”. 

The user must manually change the message status on the phone in order for the message to be dis¬ 
played on the iDrive next time the data is updated (e.g. key is cycled). 

The "Current Office" screen tells the user about the number of new messages, which tasks are active 
and forthcoming deadlines.

USB audio interface 



Apple devices can now be connected with the original Apple USB cable. 

With the Coinbox, an iPhone or iPod can now be connected using the customer's “original” Apple 
USB cable. This feature still requires the optional equipment iPod and USB adapter SA 6FL (included 
in option SA 6NL BMW Assist w/enhanced BT & USB). In this case all data and other information, in¬ 
cluding the audio data, are transmitted via the USB cable. Because the device is now also charged via 
this cable the familiar Y cable is no longer needed. 

A 

Note: Non-compatible iPods (e.g. first-generation iPod Nanos) still have to be connected us¬ 
ing the familiar Y cable. 


A_ _ 

Note: In some cases where the device is not sufficiently charged by the vehicle, the use 
of a charging adapter# 61 12 2 167 663 may be necessary. Refer to parts Bulletin # 

V-13-1010-6515 for more information. 


Album covers 

Album covers can be displayed with MP3 players, USB sticks, MTP players, iPods and iPhones provid¬ 
ing it is included in the MP3 file. 

The album covers are only displayed if the connection has been established via USB (SA 6FL).

Software updates 

The Combox will enable the customer for the first time to update the firmware of a system device. To 
update the Combox firmware, the Bluetooth profile software update must be downloaded from the 
BMW web site (when one is available) and stored on a USB stick. For this purpose, any conventional 
USB stick with sufficient storage capacity can be used. The firmware file is then transferred from the 
USB stick to the Combox via the USB audio interface (option SA 6FL) in the center console.

Note: This Combox feature was still under development at the time of this training material re¬ 
lease please refer to the BMW website http://www.bmwusa.com/bluetooth. for more information.

The customer can purchase a USB stick in the form of a BMW flat key from a BMW Service Center. 
This means the Service Advisor/Parts Sales Consultant can perform a one-off software update for the 
customer. The customer can use the USB stick to perform further software updates himself or, de¬ 
pending on which products are available, do this at the dealership.

5. Connected Drive 


BMW Connected Drive is effectively a personal assistant to the driver that employs state-of-the-art 
technology to provide the driver with all the information he requires. With the market introduction of 
the F01, BMW Connected Drive was enhanced by a further innovation. With the F25, a number of 
functions have been introduced to the X3 for the first time. 


5.1. Google™ local search 

The search engine for special destinations is a function Connected Drive. The special destinations can 
be selected directly from a list. This list can be found under the "Navigation" menu item in the "Special 
destinations" sub-menu. It is now also possible in the F25 to search for special destinations with BMW 
Search . The results returned by the Google™ search engine are used.

An antenna rod is not required on the F25 because of the (BMW patented) "Wing" antenna system in¬ 
tegrated into the rear window defroster. The FM antennas are obtained from the semicircular shaped 
heated area and the collecting rails (left and right). The AM (medium wave) antenna is made up of the 
left wing layout. The antenna of the remote control service (FBD) is in the right wing. 



By partitioning the heating element and arranging it in a semicircular patern ample area has been pro¬ 
vided for the most critical antennas. The design also provides an effective defrosting element for the 
rear window in the event of condensation/icing. 

The antenna amplifier for AM/FM and remote control service is located on the center upper part of the 
window.
