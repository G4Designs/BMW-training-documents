2.1.1. Introduction 

The F25 body is comprised mainly of strong, lightweight materials. This is achieved with the intelligent 
application of higher-strength, multi-phase steels and super-strength, press hardened steels. On aver¬ 
age, the strength of the body materials used for the F25 is 27% higher than the E83. 

The construction with lightweight materials makes a decisive contribution to reducing the overall vehi¬ 
cle weight which results in a significant contribution to the following: 

• Driving dynamics 

• Reducing fuel consumption 

• Reducing C0 2 emissions 

• Passive safety. 


4 


F25 Introduction 

2. Body 

Highlights 

• High proportion of multi-phase steels (14 % of the bodyshell weight) 

• High proportion of press hardened steels (4% of the bodyshell weight). 

The higher-strength multi-phase steels and super-strength press hardened steels ensure maximum 
strength of the passenger safety cell with low weight, thus making a huge contribution to passive safe¬ 
ty. 

In the case of the press hardened steels, an innovative development with passive corrosion protection 
is used. This development is unprecedented as suitable press hardened sheet metal materials with 
sacrificial corrosion protection have not been available in the market until now. The development of 
press hardening technology means that a series-compatible procedure for the manufacturing of galva¬ 
nized press hardened components is now available. 

During this process, galvanized sheet steel is initially cold worked then heated to roughly 1652°F 
(900°C). They are then cooled down right away to roughly 158°F (70°C) and hardened within a few 
seconds in the pressing tool with integrated water cooling directly. Following this procedure, the mini¬ 
mum elastic limit of the components is significantly higher than 1000 MPa. 

Components manufactured in this manner can be used in areas where moisture is present without 
corrosion of the base material occurring. Additional corrosion protection measures are no longer re¬ 
quired for this steel. 

2.1.2. Materials 

A modern vehicle body must meet a great many requirements. Despite small outer dimensions, it 
should provide a passenger compartment that is a large as possible. In the event of an accident, pas¬ 
sengers must be protected against injury as effectively as possible. The torque that is generated al¬ 
so means that all assemblies, e.g. the engine and transmission, rely on the body for support. Further¬ 
more, the body must have high static and above all dynamic rigidity in order to guarantee the outstand¬ 
ing driving characteristics that are typical of BMW. 

Last but not least, the supporting structure of the vehicle must be durable over the long term and, in 
the event of an accident, it must be possible for repairs to be carried out at a reasonable cost and with 
a minimum amount of effort. 

In order to meet all of these requirements, BMW pursues the strategy of creating each component 
from the material best suited for its function. 

The word "steel" is ultimately an umbrella term that describes the large number of alloys with widely 
varying properties that are used.

Other steels (< 300 MPa) 


Multi-phase steels are steels where the structure consists of a number of phases. Examples of high¬ 
er-strength multi-phase steels with a limit of elasticity R p0 .2 of 300 to 600 MPa are dual-phase steels 
or TRIP steels. Examples of higher-strength multi-phase steels with a limit of elasticity R p0 .2 above 600 
MPa are complex-phase steels or martensitic-phase steels. 

Press hardened manganese-boron steels are super-strength steels with a limit of elasticity R p0 .2 above 
900 MPa. 

Weight proportions 

In order to reduce the vehicle weight and still ensure maximum strength of the bodyshell, the propor¬ 
tion of higher or high-strength multi-phase steels and super-strength press hardened steels used has 
increased.

2.1.3. Corrosion protection and leak prevention 

In order to optimize corrosion protection, mainly galvanized steel plates and sheet aluminium plates 
are used on the body. The joining technologies used are welding and bonding. 

The overlaps of the metal panels are designed in such a way that the join surfaces are minimized. This 
is done to prevent bondline corrosion. Water is prevented from entering the body structure by means 
of constructive bonding and sealing of the join surfaces. 

In particularly critical areas, expansion foam parts are used to seal the body cavities against moisture. 
Where sheets are doubled up in wet chambers, these are sealed twice and, if required, additionally 
preserved with wax. 


Where required, the overlaps of the metal panels in dry chambers are sealed off to prevent dust from 
entering.

F25 Introduction 

2. Body 


Corrosion-critical material pairing is avoided. The combination of material substrates and joining meth¬ 
ods is carefully coordinated to eliminate the risk of corrosion. 

Coating process 

In the painting process in the immersion cleaning unit, the bodyshell is: 

• cleaned by alkali 

• phosphated (roughing of the surface for better adhesion) 

• coated in the immersion process with KTL (corrosion protection paint that coats all the body 
cavities from the inside). 

The organic layer of paint is then annealed. 

The body is sealed with PVC and protected by filler, top coat and clear varnish on the outer skin. 

With the F25, selective cavity preservation is carried out in particularly critical body areas. 

The objectives of these body treatments are: 

• No visual signs of corrosion for five years in the area of the outer skin 

• No visual signs of corrosion in the undercarriage area for three years 

• No rust damage for twelve years 

• Extremely water and dust tight. 

• Fording depth at 4 mph 500 mm /19.7 inches.

F25 Introduction 

2. Body 


The door of the F25 is drawn down further than the door of the E70. An additional sealing lip at the 
door outer skin trim panel protects large sections of the entrance against dirt contamination. This sig¬ 
nificantly reduces the risk of soiling clothing when getting in and out. 

The trim panel is designed as a single-shell injection moulded part clipped to the door outer skin. The 
grained surface makes the trim panel less susceptible to damage when compared to a painted com¬ 
ponent. In vehicles with the optional equipment X-Line package (SA 3XL), a chrome strip is bonded to 
the trim panel in order to further enhance the impact of the component. 


2.3. Panoramic glass sunroof 

A two-part panoramic glass sunroof (SA 402) can be ordered as optional equipment for the F25. The 
larger glass surface lends the passenger compartment a bright and spacious appearance. This en¬ 
hances the sense of space. 

The front edge of the glass slide/tilt sunroof cover runs more or less parallel to the windshield/roof 
edge (contour roof) which lends the vehicle a more harmonious overall appearance.

The panoramic glass sunroof is a slide / tilt sunroof that runs inwards. The glass panel and sliding trim 
can be operated fully electrically and are controlled according to the usual BMW slide / tilt sunroof op¬ 
erating logic by means of a switch in the roof function center (FZD): 

• To open the roof: press the switch backwards 

• To close the roof: press the switch forwards 

• Roof in vent position: press the switch upwards. 

The same operating logic used for opening BMW panoramic glass sunroofs is applied to the sliding 
trim. The operating logic corresponds to the direction of movement of the components and is thus 
easy for customers to understand. 

To exclude the risk of possible injury, an anti-trap mechanism is implemented for the complete trav¬ 
el path of the glass slide/tilt sunroof cover and the sliding trim. The roof function center (FZD) can de¬ 
tect the sudden increase in the power consumption of the motors which occurs when the glass slide/ 
tilt sunroof cover or sliding trim encounters an obstruction. They are then stopped and moved back 
slightly in the opposite direction. The electronic control system takes account of international legal re¬ 
quirements. 

By using suitable materials for the sliding trim, the noise level when the glass slide/tilt sunroof cover 
and sliding trim are fully closed is similar to that of a vehicle with a normal roof. 

When the roof is open, a mesh-type wind deflector ensures that background noise remains within ac¬ 
ceptable limits.

The static torsional rigidity of a body describes the degree of distortion around an axis through the 
application of torque. As a conflict of objectives exists between lightweight construction and rigidi¬ 
ty, the static torsional rigidity can never be considered in isolation, and instead in conjunction with the 
lightweight materials grade. 

The lightweight materials grade describes the ratio between the value for static torsional rigidity in re¬ 
lation to the tire contact patch (toe x wheelbase) and the weight of the bodyshell (without doors and 
lids). It provides a measure of the degree of rigidity achieved for the tire contact patch with the smallest 
possible mass. 

The F25 has a lightweight construction grade of 2.6 owing to intelligent geometric design of the load 
paths and construction with lightweight materials. 


2.5. Vibrations and acoustics 

2.5.1. Vibration comfort 

The prerequisite for ensuring good vibrational characteristics of the vehicle is carefully targeted design 
of structural dynamics in interaction with the excitation from the chassis and suspension. 


16 
















F25 Introduction 

2. Body 


To ensure this, the rigidity of the body has been further increased by roughly 27 % in comparison with 
the E83. 

The vibrations in the chassis and suspension and complete vehicle have been harmonized through se¬ 
lective optimization of the excitation forces in the chassis and suspension and also the properties of 
the vibration system. 

This made it possible to compensate for the higher excitation that occurs in comparison with the E83 
due to the use of run-flat tires. 


2.5.2. Acoustics 

The sound insulation has a significant impact on the acoustics of the passenger compartment. Effec¬ 
tive insulation against noise emitted by the drive train components is normally achieved by using more 
weight. To keep this increase in weight as low as possible, the design in the bulkhead area is condi¬ 
tion-based. In doing so, only the surface weight that is absolutely required, depending on the neces¬ 
sary components, is used at this point. 

A new sound insulation concept has been applied in the transmission tunnel area, which combines 
high structural rigidity with a high degree of insulation and sheet metal panel damping. During this pro¬ 
cess, sandwich panels are systematically joined together using a damping mass material.

2.6. Crash testing research 

2.6.1. Preventative measures 

Based on the research data compiled from racing vehicles, the extreme loading conditions that occur 
in these situations, the following measures must be taken to enhance the passenger safety cell and 
maximize the safety of drivers: 

• Roll cage 

• Body-contoured seat with special six-point seat belt 

• Safety clothing with crash helmet. 

Passive safety is an extremely important issue for BMW and its customers on the road, and not just in 
racing sports. 

The following comparison vividly demonstrates the forces at work during a collision: crashing against a 
wall at 50 km/h (31 mph) is roughly the same as falling out of the 4th story of a building. At this speed, 
the seat belt can significantly reduce the risk of injury but cannot eliminate it altogether. Injuries due to 
impact with the steering wheel during severe head-on collisions can be prevented with the additional 
protection of the airbag (an ideal compliment to the seat belt system). 

The airbag, in conjunction with the 3-point automatic-reel belt, provides optimum protection in the 
event of a head-on collision. A great deal of thought is required in developing its triggering behavior to 
ensure it only activates when needed. Smaller vibrations that occur when driving over a level crossing 
for example must not cause the airbag to trigger. 

Around 14 % of all accidents in the BMW accident database are side impact and 20 % of these side 
collisions were fatal accidents.

These insights show that protection of the occupants from side collisions needed to improve signifi¬ 
cantly. The first and most important measure needed to protect the vehicle occupants in the event of a 
side collision is, and also remains, a stable vehicle structure in order to reduce intrusion. 

The introduction of a side airbag, and also the head airbag from 5/97, were further steps taken to pro¬ 
vide occupants with optimum protection against a side collision. 

2.6.2. Safety testing/Accident analysis 

Before a new BMW vehicle is launched onto the market, a large number of crash tests are carried out. 
The purpose of these crash tests is to verify compliance with the legal regulations in the relevant coun¬ 
tries and also consumer protection requirements. 

Crash tests are also carried out based on the insights gained from accident research carried out by 
BMW. Accident research by BMW has revealed a high percentage of head-on collisions with trees 
which is why BMW carries out a head-on crash test against a post in order to optimize the vehicle 
structure, even if there is no legal requirement to do so. 

The safety of BMW vehicles is therefore much higher than the legal requirements for safety worldwide. 
The most important crash tests are explained in detail below: 

• Head-on collision according to US-NCAP 

• Side collision according to US-NCAP 

• Side collision according to US-IIHS 

• Rear-end collision according to FMVSS 301 

• Pedestrian protection 

The total number of accidents recorded in the accident statistics is divided up according to the various 
crash situations: head-on collision, side collision, rear-end collision and rollover. 

2.6.3. Head-on collision 

A range of head-on collision tests have been devised in order to make the testing conditions as realis¬ 
tic as possible. 

The US-NCAP (New Car Assessment Program) is a consumer protection test that places the toughest 
demands on the vehicle structure and passenger restraint system in the context of a head-on collision.

F25 Introduction

Head-on collision according to US-NCAP 

The US-NCAP on the other hand prescribes a collision against a rigid barrier with an impact speed of 
35 mph (56 km/h) and 100% offset. 

The vehicle is occupied by two dummies, one on the driver seat and one on the front passenger seat. 

However, a 40% offset test is carried out in the USA by the IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safe¬ 
ty) at 40 mph (64 km/h) against a deformable barrier.

2.6.4. Side collision 

Four side collision tests have been devised in order to make the testing conditions as realistic as pos¬ 
sible. The configurations in USA and Europe are different. 

The US-IIHS test places the toughest demands on the vehicle structure and passenger restraint sys¬ 
tem during the side collision due to the modified test conditions with increased ground clearance. 

The main evaluation criterion is the individual and overall evaluation of the risk of injury for various ar¬ 
eas of the body. These tests also provide important insights into the structural behavior of the passen¬ 
ger compartment under loads that partially occur locally. 

Side collision according to US-NCAP 

The US-NCAP prescribes 38.5 mph (62 km/h) and 27 degrees as the impact speed and angle respec¬ 
tively of the moving barrier. 

The driver's seat of the vehicle and the seat behind it are occupied by a dummy.

Side collision according to US-IIHS 


2.6.5. Rear-end collision 

The US law FMVSS 301 (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard) is used as the basis for the rear-end 
collision test. This corresponds to one vehicle driving into another stationary vehicle at 80 km/h. 

Rear-end collision according to FMVSS 301 

US regulation FMVSS 301 prescribes a rear-offset crash with 70% offset at 50 mph (80 km/h) with a 
moving barrier (with mass of 1368 kg). 

A aluminium honeycomb deformable barrier is fitted to the barrier wagon. 

The test is carried out on the tank filling side and serves as a leakage test of the fuel system. In addi¬ 
tion, the structure of the vehicle, seats, rear axle and the components in the luggage compartment are 
tested under this load.

Pedestrian protection 

In addition to passenger protection tests, crash test also includes a pedestrian protection test. During 
this test, the risk of injury to children and adults in the event of a head-on collision at 40 km/h (25 mph) 
is evaluated. Sheathed metal cylinders and balls of varying weights are used as a substitute for legs 
and heads and shot at defined points on the front of the vehicle; the stress on the "body parts" is mea¬ 
sured.

The front end which incorporates corresponding deformation cavities below the hood (at least 60 
mm/2.36 in) as well as resilient hinge kinematics, satisfies the stringent pedestrian protection require¬ 
ments. 

The bumpers play their part in passive protection for pedestrians due to their design, geometry and 50 
mm/1.98 in foam. 

A weight reduction of up to roughly 4 kg/8.8 lb can be achieved by using aluminium as opposed to 
steel profiles.

3.1.2. Hood 



F25Hood 

The Hood is made of steel and features deformation elements for pedestrian protection. 

3.1.3. Undercarriage concept 

The vehicle undercarriage which is more or less entirely smooth reduces drag and upward thrust. Spe¬ 
cific air inlets ensure optimum cooling of components. The underbody covers improve acoustics and 
protect lines and other components against stone chipping damage and dirt contamination. This pro¬ 
tects the body and components against corrosion. 

A 

Changes to the vehicle underbody or omitting trim panel components leads to changes in the air flow 
at the vehicle underbody. This can influence road grip.

The air guides enhance the effect of the smooth vehicle underbody. They reduce the drag of the 
wheels and improve the oncoming flow that cools the brakes. Furthermore, integrated ramps in the ve¬ 
hicle underbody provide additional cooling of the brakes.

Crash-active headrest 

The front seats are equipped with crash-active head restraints. These head restraints feature a py¬ 
rotechnic actuator that epitomizes the distance and height of the restraint in relation to the head in 
the event of a rear-end collision of sufficient force. This reduces the stress in the region of the cervical 
spine during a rear-end collision. 

A_ 

If the active head restraints have been triggered, the pyro-actuators must be replaced in the 
workshop. It is essential to refer to the repair instructions please.

F25 Introduction 

3. Exterior trims and interior equipment 

For a heating/air-conditioning unit in this class, it delivers outstanding performance. The entire 
volume of air in the vehicle can be replaced up to 3 times a minute. 

• Fresh/recirculation air is filtered through interaction with automatic air recirculation control 
sensor 

The quality of the intake air is monitored continuously by an automatic air recirculation control 
sensor. This ensures that pollutants do not enter the passenger compartment when driving 
in towns or through tunnels. The incoming fresh air is also cleaned by a carbon canister. With 
the air recirculation function, air is also filtered in order to prevent soiling of the heating and air 
conditioning system components and passenger compartment and also to ensure hygienic 
operation. 

• Solar and condensation sensor 

A combination sensor integrated into the mirror base determines the angle of incidence and 
the intensity of solar radiation. This means that although solar radiation is present the IHKA 
can maintain an even and pleasant temperature in the passenger compartment. The IHKA can 
reliably prevent fogging of the window glass through selective control intervention by measur¬ 
ing the surface temperature of the windscreen and air humidity. 

• Climate styles and layering function 

When the IHKA is in AUTO mode, the customer can adjust the amounts of air according to 
his individual comfort requirements using five different "climate styles" without exiting AUTO 
mode. The ventilation temperature (oncoming flow at upper body) can be adjusted individually 
via the layering function. 


3.3. Luggage compartment 

The luggage compartment capacity is 550 liters. The luggage compartment has enough space for four 
golf bags or three mountain bikes (for example), as well as three occupants. 

Highlights 

• 12V charging socket under loading floor, e.g. for the storage of compact electronic equipment 
in a concealed area combined with charging option for when the vehicle is in motion (in con¬ 
junction with SA 493, storage compartment package) 

• 12V charging socket in trim panel of luggage compartment on right 

• Folding and removable collapsible box, which can be stored below the loading floor (in con¬ 
junction with SA 493, storage compartment package) 

• Flexible storage net for three different attachment positions including pocket function (in con¬ 
junction with SA 493, storage compartment package) 

• Scratch and wear-resistant stainless steel loading edge (in conjunction with SA 3XL, X-Line 
package) 

• Luggage compartment separation net (SA 413): the roller blind cassette can be unlocked at 
the push of a button which represents a significant improvement in terms of comfort.
