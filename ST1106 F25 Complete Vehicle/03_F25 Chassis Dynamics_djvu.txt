The two-joint spring strut front axle with trailing links in the F25 offers the ideal combination of driving 
dynamics and ride comfort. The supporting function of the steering box housing achieves extremely 
high rigidity with minimum weight. 

Low-friction ball joints are used in the front axle. This has greatly improved the response characteris¬ 
tics. 

The standard Electronic Power Steering EPS (electromechanical power steering) is a new feature of 
the F25 and makes a significant contribution to "EfficientDynamics". (2VL Variable sport steering is 
available as an option) 

The Electronic Damper Control EDC is available as optional equipment (SA 223 Dynamic Damper 
Control) to be used in conjunction with conventional dampers. 

The front axles installed in the off-road vehicles are listed in the table below.

3.2. Rear axle 

The HA5 five-link rear axle installed in the F25 is derived from a double wishbone rear axle with rear- 
mounted track rod. Although the engineering design principle of the rear axle is based on the one used 
in the E8x and E9x vehicles, this version is characterized by its low installation space requirement and 
light weight of its components. 

In addition to a particularly precise wheel control, this design delivers outstanding driving dynamics in 
relation to the following: 

• Directional stability, accuracy 

• Load change response 

• Self-steering response 

• Lane change stability 

• Steering movement (transitional response from cornering to straight-ahead driving). 

The two conflicting objectives, driving dynamics and comfort have been successfully adapted with the 
use of: 


double-elastic rubber mounting bearing 

rear axle suspension with reduced preload (via high suspension ratio) 
wide supporting base of rear axle support 
high structural rigidity of rear axle support 


The optimized elasto-kinematics ensures ride comfort as the use of small but effective control arms 
means that the rear axle hardly reacts to interference. 

In contrast to the E84 and E9x series, spring struts are installed at the rear axle instead of the split ar¬ 
rangement of springs/dampers. A high suspension ratio has been achieved through the installation of 
spring struts. 

The flat space-saving design of the axle with wide spring struts mounted on the outside results in a flat 
luggage compartment floor with generous loading width. 


Low unsprung masses have been implemented using innovative sheet-metal control arm technology. 
The rear axles installed in the off-road vehicles are listed in the table below.

3.4. Tire Pressure Monitoring 

3.4.1. Operating principle 

The F25 is being equipped with the latest generation of tire pressure monitoring systems. 

The direct measuring system consists of the TPM control unit with integrated reception antenna and 
four wheel electronics. It was possible to reduce the number of components and cost of the system by 
integrating the reception antenna in the TPM control unit. 

The four wheel electronics transmit the tire pressure and temperature to the TPM control unit via ra¬ 
dio communication (433 MHz). Once the wheel electronics have been woken up, (vehicle speed > 20 
km/h/12mph), a total of 25 telegrams are transmitted once at two second intervals. Providing the pres¬ 
sure has not dropped, individual telegrams are then sent every 18 seconds from the wheel electronics 
to the TPM control unit. As a prerequisite for the wheel electronics to go to sleep, the wheel must be at 
a standstill for more than five minutes. 

Resetting the tire pressure values 

The tire pressure values are reset via the instrument panel or Central Information Display CID. The 
TPM text message appears, or the permanent TPM indicator light lights up, in the instrument panel 
when the teach-in process starts. 

Teach-in process 

During the teach-in process, the wheel electronics identification numbers (ID) are transmitted to the 
TPM control unit. The TPM control unit can identify the wheel position of the corresponding wheel 
electronics via the identification numbers once the teach-in process is complete. 

Two acceleration sensors are installed in each of the wheel electronics in order to be able to determine 
their positions. The acceleration sensors determine the wheel's direction of rotation. This means that 
right/left differentiation of the wheel electronics positions at the vehicle is possible. 

The high frequency signals received are evaluated in order to determine whether the wheel electron¬ 
ics are at the front or rear axle. The TPM control unit with integrated receiver is mounted in the outer 
area of the luggage compartment well above the rear axle. The level of the signals received by the TPM 
control unit from the wheels on the rear axle is higher than the level of signals sent by the wheel elec¬ 
tronics on the front axle. This means it is possible to determine whether the wheel electronics are at 
the front or rear of the vehicle. 

The entire teach-in process takes between roughly one and twelve minutes at the most. The following 
factors influence the duration: 

• The condition of the road (e.g. cobbles) 

• The current mode of the wheel electronics (awake/gone to sleep) 

• The TPM control unit already knows what the IDs of the wheel electronics are.

Once the teach-in process is complete, the TPM text message or solid TPM indicator light are can¬

Pressure drop 



F25 TPM pressure drop 


Once the teach-in process is complete, the wheel electronics send the pressure, temperature and also 
the identification numbers of the tires to the TPM control unit at regular intervals when driving. 

If a pressure change of > 20 kPa (0.2 bar, 2.9 psi) is identified within two successive pressure measure¬ 
ments, the wheel electronics for the relevant wheel immediately assumes a fast transmitting mode. It 
then sends information to the control unit at one-second intervals. If the pressure drop is higher than 
25%, the TPM text message "Tire Low" appears.

3.4.4. Notes for Service 

Teach-in process 

The wheel electronics must be taught in under the following circumstances: 

• The tire pressure has been changed 

• A tire has been changed 

• Wheels are replaced axle-wise. 

The driver can start the teach-in process via the Central Information Display CID and the controller. For 
more information, refer to the vehicle Owner's manual. 

Service life of batteries for wheel electronics 

The service life of the batteries installed in the wheel electronics is roughly 7.5 years. The current val¬ 
ue of the service life counter in the batteries of the wheel electronics can be read out via the diagnosis 
system. 

If the battery is fully discharged or defective, an TPM fault message is displayed. 


Remove/install wheel electronics 

The following points must be observed when removing/installing the wheel electronics of the tire pres¬ 
sure control (TPM):

4.1. Service brakes 

The F25 has a hydraulic dual-circuit brake system with front/rear split. Conventional internally ventilat¬ 
ed brake discs are installed at the front and rear axle of all F25 engine versions. Grey cast iron floating 
caliper brakes are installed at the front and rear axle. In this instance, the EMF actuator on the rear axle 
is integrated in the brake caliper. 

The familiar brake pad wear monitoring function for the Condition Based Service display continues to 
be used. Brake pad wear sensors are therefore installed at the front left and rear right wheel brakes. 

The brake dimensions of the F25 are listed in the following table.

4.2. EMF Electromechanical Parking Brake 

On the F25 there is an EMF integrated in the rear brake calipers. 

The use of the electromechanical parking brake offers the following advantages: 

• Operation via an ergonomically designed button in the center console 

• Safe and reliable application and release of the parking brake under all pre-conditions 

• Automatic Hold function (ACC Active Cruise Control) 

• Dynamic emergency braking function ensured by way of the control systems (ABS), even with 
a low coefficient of friction 

• Discontinuation of the parking brake lever in the center console makes room for new equip¬ 
ment features.

4.2.3. System structure 

The EMF control unit receives the driver's instruction to apply the parking brake from the parking 
brake button. The vehicle condition is queried/detected via the electrical system connection and the 
bus systems. The EMF control unit decides whether all the pre-conditions for the parking brake se¬ 
quence are satisfied. If so, the two EMF actuators on the rear brake calipers are operated.

4.2.4. System function 

Due to the spindle's self-locking facility, the clamping force remains securely applied even when no 
power supply is connected, and the vehicle is thus securely held. Once the required force is reached, 
the parking brake applied status is indicated by a red indicator lamp on the instrument panel and an 
additional red LED in the parking brake button. If the vehicle's parking brake is already applied, pulling 
the parking brake button again has no effect. 

The driver applies the vehicle's parking brake by pulling out the parking brake button. The operating 
direction of the button is the same as the operating direction for a mechanical parking brake lever. The 
signal from the parking brake button is read by the EMF control unit. The EMF control unit operates 
the EMF actuators on the rear brake calipers individually. 

The parking brake can be applied in any logical terminal status. Parking brake application in Terminal 
0 status is made possible by the connection from Terminal 30 to the EMF control unit. If the driver op¬ 
erates the parking brake button in Terminal 0 status, the EMF control unit is woken up. The EMF con-

trol unit then wakes up the other control units on the vehicle. Only then does the EMF control unit re¬ 
ceive the essential information about vehicle standstill. In addition, the change of parking brake status 
can also be indicated once the system has been woken up.

Roll-away detection while parking brake applied 

The roll-away detection function is designed to prevent the vehicle rolling away while the parking brake 
is applied. The roll-away detection function is always activated whenever the parking brake status 
changes from "released" to "applied" and terminates after a defined period of time from that change of 
status. 

A signal from the DSC control unit is used as the input variable for roll-away detection. As soon as that 
signal indicates that the vehicle is starting to roll during the detection window, the EMF actuators are 
immediately further tightened. That is achieved by applying maximum current to the EMF actuators for 
100 ms in order to increase the clamping force. The system then waits for 400 ms. If the vehicle starts 


30 






















F25 Chassis Dynamics

to roll again, the retightening process is repeated (up to three times). If rolling of the vehicle is still de¬ 
tected after retightening the parking brake three times, the function terminates with a fault entry in the 
fault memory. 

Temperature monitoring 

The temperature monitoring function ensures that the loss of parking-brake force that occurs when 
hot brake discs cool down is compensated for. The temperature monitoring function is activated if the 
temperature is above a defined value on a change of parking brake status from "released" to "applied". 

The temperature of the brake discs is calculated individually for each wheel by the DSC control unit 
and communicated to the EMF control unit. When the status change takes place, the higher of the two 
brake disc temperatures is applied for temperature monitoring purposes. The temperature ranges and 
corresponding retightening periods are stored in a characteristic map. 

The appropriate retightening periods from the characteristic map are applied according to the temper¬ 
ature on change of status. Once the first retightening period has elapsed, the parking brake is retight¬ 
ened for the first time. After expiry of the second retightening period, the parking brake is retightened 
again, and again after the third period has elapsed. The characteristic map may also contain the value 
0 for one or more retightening periods. In that case, the corresponding retightening sequences do not 
take place. The function terminates when the last retightening sequence has been completed. 

Releasing the parking brake 

The parking brake is released by pressing the parking brake button down. However, for the parking 
brake to actually be released, Terminal 15 must be ON and at least one of the following preconditions 
satisfied: 

• Brake pedal applied, or 

• Automatic transmission parking lock engaged. 

That prevents the vehicle starting to roll when not intended, e.g. if another occupant apart from the 
driver presses the parking brake button. Once the parking brake is released, the red indicator lamp on 
the instrument panel and the red LED in the parking brake button go out. 

Activation of the EMF actuator sets the spindle in motion. The rotation of the spindle moves the spin¬ 
dle nut a small, defined distance away from the brake piston. 

Dynamic emergency braking 

The law requires that there are two operating facilities for the brakes. On the F25, the second operat¬ 
ing facility after the brake pedal is the parking brake button in the center console. If the parking brake 
button is pulled up while the vehicle is moving, a dynamic emergency braking operation with a defined 
procedure is performed by the DSC system. This function is intended for emergency situations in 
which the driver is not able to brake the vehicle using the brake pedal. Other occupants can also bring 
the vehicle to a standstill in this way if, for example, the driver suddenly falls unconscious. 

During dynamic emergency braking, brake pressure is generated hydraulically at all four wheel brakes. 
The DSC functions are fully active and the brake lights are operated. That represents a fundamental 
advantage over manual parking brakes. 


31 



F25 Chassis Dynamics 

4. Brakes 


The dynamic emergency braking sequence only remains in effect while the parking brake button is be¬ 
ing pulled. The level of deceleration applied by the DSC is steeply increased. During dynamic emer¬ 
gency braking the EMF indicator light on the instrument panel is activated. In addition, a Check Control 
message is displayed along with an acoustic signal in order to draw the driver's attention to the special 
situation. 

If the driver simultaneously brakes by pressing the brake pedal and pulling the parking brake button, 
the DSC control unit prioritizes. The greater deceleration demand is put into effect. If dynamic emer¬ 
gency braking is continued until the vehicle is at a standstill, the vehicle remains braked even after the 
parking brake button is released. The EMF indicator light on the instrument panel remains on. The 
driver can then release the parking brake (see "Releasing the parking brake"). 

Parking brake fault 

If a fault occurs on the parking brake, the EMF indicator lamp on the instrument panel shows yellow. A 
Check Control message is displayed. 


PARK

Emergency release 

Emergency release of the parking brake by the customer is not provided for. 

The parking brake can be released by unscrewing the EMF actuators and manually screwing back the 
spindle. 

Replacing brake pads 

To replace the brake pads the EMF actuator must be in the fully released position so that the brake 
piston can be pressed back. The EMF actuators can be activated via the diagnosis system and moved 
to the fully released position. That position is required in order to be able to change the brake pads. 
Once the installation position is reached, installation mode is automatically activated. 


32 



F25 Chassis Dynamics 

4. Brakes 



A_ 

As long as the EMF control unit is in installation mode, the parking brake cannot be applied for safe¬ 
ty reasons. If the parking brake button is nevertheless operated, the EMF indicator lamp on the instru¬ 
ment panel (KOMBI) flashes yellow. 


Installation mode can be cancelled in two ways: 

• By executing the service function "Reset installation mode" with the aid of ISTA 

• By driving the vehicle and exceeding a programmed minimum speed. 


Brake test stand detection 

The EMF control unit detects that the vehicle is on a brake test stand by means of a plausibility check 
(comparison of wheel speeds) and switches to brake test stand mode. Identification takes about. 6 
seconds. 

Pulling the parking brake button several times in sequence sets the parking brake to the following po¬ 
sitions: 


Brake pads in contact 
Force level 1 for brake test stand 
Force level 2 for brake test stand 
Target force. 


Alternatively, the parking brake button can be held continuously in the pulled-out position while brake 
test stand mode is active. The parking brake is then moved to the individual defined positions in se¬ 
quence at intervals of 3 seconds. 


33 











F25 Chassis Dynamics 

4. Brakes 


When brake test stand mode is active and the EMF actuators are released, the parking brake indicator 
light flashes slowly. 

When brake test stand mode is active and the EMF actuators are partially applied, the parking brake in¬ 
dicator light starts to flash more quickly. 

When the vehicle is on a brake test stand, the parking brake can be released without having to press 
the brake or clutch pedal. Brake test stand mode is automatically cancelled when the vehicle is driv¬ 
en off the brake test stand. It is also deactivated if the parking brake button is pressed in or if a fault is 
present.

5. Steering 

5.1. Electronic Power Steering EPS 

The F25 xDrive is the first mass-produced vehicle with xDrive to be equipped with Electronic Power 
Steering EPS (electromechanical power steering) which replaces the conventional hydraulic power 
steering. 

In contrast to hydraulic power steering, with EPS steering the servo forces are applied to the rack via 
an electric motor and a reduction gear. 

This has achieved an average reduction in fuel consumption of roughly 0.3 I per 100 km when com¬ 
pared to conventional hydraulic power steering. That helps to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions. As 
there is no oil in the EPS, it is environmentally cleaner and more service friendly than conventional hy¬ 
draulic power steering. 

Compared to conventional hydraulic power steering, the installation and maintenance cost has been 
significantly reduced thanks to the compact design of the steering box with integrated electric motor 
and control electronics. 

With EPS steering, the steering servo (steering forces) and also the return characteristics are freely 
configurable. This means that the steering and drivability can be adapted optimally to the relevant driv¬ 
ing situation (e.g. when driving in the city or on the highway). 

Servotronic, i.e. steering servo dependent on vehicle speed, is available as optional equipment (SA 
216). 

If a driving dynamics control switch is installed - two different settings, "Normal" or "Sporty" can be 
accessed with the following optional equipment: 

• EDC (SA 223) 

• Sports steering (SA 2VL) 

• Servotronic (Standard) 

• Steptronic sport automatic transmission (SA 2TB) 


Although Active Steering is not provided for in the F25, "Variable sport steering" (SA 2VL) is available 
as the optional equipment.

5.1.3. Steering angle sensor 

In the F25, information on the steering angle is not acquired via the Electronic Power Steering EPS 
from a separate sensor at the steering wheel and is instead deduced from the motor position angle of 
the EPS motor in relation to the steering wheel. 

The EPS reports the position of the rack via FlexRay to the ICM control unit. In this case the EPS cal¬ 
culates the absolute position of the rack based on the current position of the EPS motor rotor and the 
number of full rotor revolutions from the neutral position (corresponds to straight-ahead driving). 

Taking this position as the starting point, the ICM control unit determines, among other things, the 
steering angle in relation to the wheel using the stored gear ratio parameters (between the rack and 
steering angle in relation to wheel) and transmits these via FlexRay. This wheel-specific steering angle 
is used by the Dynamic Stability Control and other systems as a reference variable for internal control 
functions. 

In cases where the absolute value is not available from the EPS (terminal 30 loss, flashing process), the 
absolute value is determined through interaction of the ICM and EPS via a teach-in function by steer¬ 
ing from end stop to end stop (e.g. straight-ahead position -> left -> right -> straight-ahead position). 


5.2. Variable sport steering 

The optional equipment "Variable sport steering" (SA 2VL) is available for the F25 as an alternative to 
the basic version of the EPS. This is the first steering system available on the market to combine the 
benefits of an extremely direct, variable steering gear ratio with the operating principle of EPS steering. 

The variable sport steering increases ride comfort and also agility. The direct ratio reduces the total 
steering angle, i.e. the number of steering wheel revolutions from steering stop to steering stop, by 
roughly 25%. This therefore increases comfort during driving manoeuvres that require larger steering 
angles, e.g. when parking, turning off or turning. 


44 










F25 Chassis Dynamics 

5. Steering 

Compared to the basic version of the EPS steering, the vehicle responds more directly and has greater 
agility owing to the more direct steering gear ratio and the resulting lower required steering angle. This 
is effective during avoidance manoeuvres, for example. 

The variable steering gear ratio is achieved by using a displacement-dependent rack gearing geome¬ 
try. When roughly in the center position of the steering box, the steering responds precisely with stable 
directional stability. As the steering angles move out of the center position, the ratio becomes increas¬ 
ingly more direct.

ICM control unit 


The ICM control unit is installed on the center console by means of a holder. It contains the driving dy¬ 
namics sensor system and central sensor system for the airbag. 

6.2.2. System function 

Influence of the ICM control unit on driving stability control in detail: 

• Performance Control (SA 2VG) 

Selective braking at the rear inner cornering wheel makes a more neutral self-steering re¬ 
sponse possible and reduces the tendency to understeer. For the duration of braking interven¬ 
tion, the output of the engine is increased proportionally so this is not perceived as decelera¬ 
tion. The setpoint is calculated in the ICM control unit and put into action in the Dynamic Sta¬ 
bility Control. (For more information!, refer to sections 6.4 and 6.5 of this training material.) 

• Driving dynamics control 

The driver can use the operating elements DTC button or driving dynamics control switch 
(DTC mode, Dynamic Stability Control OFF) to activate the driving dynamics control FDR. The 
function mode is displayed via the instrument panel (KOMBI). 

Evaluation of the DTC button and driving dynamics control switch as well as the changeover 
logic, including communication with the systems involved (including DSC), takes place in the 
ICM control unit. In addition, the ICM control unit incorporates system monitoring of part¬ 
ner functions that changes back to normal mode when one of the functions being monitored 
drops out (DSC ON). 

• Hill Descent Control HDC 

The purpose of HDC is to support the driver when driving downhill. When the driver activates 
this function by pushing the button, the vehicle travels on downhill gradients at a constant 
speed defined by the driver of between roughly 5 and 25 km/h. If the actual speed is not the 
same as the reference speed set by the driver, the HDC attempts by means of harmonious 
control to match the two speeds. The driver is supported by the DSC control functions during 
this process. 

A 

If the driver operates the HDC button, the ICM control unit checks this operation against the 
current states of the other assist systems. 

• Dynamic Cruise Control 

The Dynamic Cruise Control DCC is a road speed controller that incorporates brake interven¬ 
tion. The DCC function in the ICM control unit acts on the powertrain and brake via the corre¬ 
sponding interfaces. In addition, interfaces for display and operating elements and for the driv¬ 
ing dynamics sensor system exist. (For more information, refer to section 6.6.) 


48 







F25 Chassis Dynamics 

6. Driving stability control systems 

The ICM control unit contains the following sensors, depending on the vehicle equipment: 


Function Vehicles with out Vehicles with 

EDC EDC 



The information from these sensors is used to calculate the following signals which are made available 
to the Dynamic Stability Control DSC via FlexRay: 

• Yaw rate 

• Lateral acceleration 

• Longitudinal acceleration 

• Steering angle. 


6.3. Dynamic Stability Control DSC 

The Dynamic Stability Control DSC is at the heart of suspension control systems that are designed to 
increase active safety. It optimizes driving stability under all driving conditions and also traction when 
driving off and accelerating. In addition, it detects unstable driving conditions such as understeering or 
oversteering and helps keep the vehicle safely on course. 

To this end the current driving conditions are permanently recorded by the highly sensitive sensors of 
the DSC. The information acquired comes from the wheel speed, steering angle, lateral acceleration, 
longitudinal acceleration, pressure and yaw sensors (rotation around the vertical axis of the vehicle), for 
example. The single-track model calculated from this information in the DSC control unit serves as the 
basic parameter for regulatory intervention by the DSC. During this process, a comparison is made be¬ 
tween the corresponding driver input (steering wheel angle and vehicle speed). 

If the measured actual condition deviates from the calculated reference condition, action is taken to 
improve stability and/or traction. This involves selective actuation of the engine and brake manage¬ 
ment as well as the xDrive. The driving stability can be ensured once again or a traction request can be 
implemented by selectively reducing or increasing the engine torque (with active engine drag torque 
control or Performance Control) or brake intervention at individual wheels.

Adopting a suitably adapted driving style always remains the responsibility of the driver. 
Not even DSC can overcome the laws of physics. 

The additional safety features of the system should not be diminished by risky driving.

6.4.3. Drive function 

The drive torque is distributed variably in terms of driving dynamics and traction as the situation de¬ 
mands through networking with the dynamic stability control DSC. Due to its optimized design, the 
xDrive adaptation in the F25 makes a further contribution towards enhancing the driving experience. 

Understeering 

xDrive shifts more drive torque to the rear axle as the understeering tendency increases. This allows 
the front axle to build up more traction which reduces understeering. 

At the same time the Performance Control (SA 2VG) ensures, through braking intervention at the inner 
rear cornering wheel and by increasing the drive torque of the engine, that the vehicle adopts a neutral 
drivability without slowing it down.

As the understeering tendency reduces, more drive torque is directed to the 
front axle and the intervention by Performance Control diminishes 

5 

xDrive re-establishes the standard distribution, intervention by Performance 
Control is no longer required 


Oversteering 

In an oversteering driving situation, xDrive distributes the drive torque so that the load on the rear axle 
is reduced as much as possible. 

At the same time, the DSC ensures, through additional brake intervention at the outer rear wheel dur¬ 
ing cornering, that the vehicle is quickly stabilized and that neutral drivability is restored.

during cornering 

4

axle and the intervention by Performance Control diminishes

6.5. Performance Control 

The F25 features Performance Control (SA 2VG), the DSC functionality of the xDrive. 

To increase the agility of the xDrive vehicle, the understeering tendency and the required steering an¬ 
gle are reduced. This is implemented by varying the torque distribution at the rear axle. The Perfor¬ 
mance Control brakes the rear inner cornering wheel when the vehicle is being driven with a sporty 
driving style. At the same time, the drive torque of the engine is increased to compensate for the brak¬ 
ing torque produced. 

Due to the driving dynamics, the Performance Control is withdrawn at high speeds. 


6.6. Dynamic Cruise Control DCC 

The Dynamic Cruise Control DCC is a road speed controller that incorporates brake intervention. 

The DCC maintains a constant set speed at speeds higher than roughly 30 km/h - as opposed to con¬ 
ventional speed control with the following additional functions: 

• Active brake intervention - if the engine drag torque is insufficient to maintain the selected 
speed in coasting (overrun) mode, the vehicle is decelerated automatically by means of addi¬ 
tional controlled brake intervention. 

• Curve-Speed-Limiter CSL - depending on the lateral acceleration that currently exists, the 
speed in the longitudinal direction is reduced during controlled cornering as necessary. When 
exiting the corner, the speed is adjusted until the required speed is obtained once again. 


60 







F25 Chassis Dynamics 

6. Driving stability control systems 

• Comfort-Dynamic-System CDS - the driver can use an operating element at the steering 
wheel to permanently accelerate or decelerate the vehicle in two dynamic stages respective¬ 
ly in "Hand throttle mode". This means the required speed will be reached more quickly. The 
driver can accelerate or decelerate in traffic flow without estimating the target speed before¬ 
hand. 

• Controlled downhill driving - in order to reduce fuel consumption, downhill driving is con¬ 
trolled by means of overrun fuel cutoff. To reduce the load on the wheel brakes when driving 
downhill, gear downshifts are modified and torque is distributed between the front and rear 
axle. In the DSC brake control system, corresponding leakage compensation and torque distri¬ 
bution measures are applied using a substitute temperature model. This counteracts any leak¬ 
age in the brake control circuit. 

The desired speed is displayed in the instrument panel (KOMBI) by a movable marker around the 
speed reading. When the control system is active, this marker lights up green. When the DCC function 
is deactivated, the marker lights up orange and the resume speed is displayed. If the desired speed 
has been adjusted or if the DCC function is activated, the updated digital value is displayed briefly as a 
checkback signal for the operator.

6.7.3. System function 

The EDC is a variable, electronically controlled shock absorber adjustment system that controls the 
vertical dynamics. EDC adapts the damping forces of the shock absorber more or less instantly to 
changing road or driving conditions. 

The EDC consists of 

• four electronic adjusting dampers 

• the EDC control unit 

• two wheel acceleration sensors on the front axle to determine the wheel movement 

• a sensor cluster integrated in the ICM control unit to determine the movements of the body 
(pitch, vertical, roll). 

The sensors in the vehicle permanently measure 

• the body and wheel acceleration 

• the current lateral/longitudinal acceleration 

• the vehicle speed 

• the steering wheel position. 


64 












F25 Chassis Dynamics 

6. Driving stability control systems 

The EDC control unit uses this measured data in conjunction with the road profile and driving situa¬ 
tion to calculate the wheel-specific control commands for the electromagnetic valves in the shock ab¬ 
sorbers. The damping forces delivered will therefore always match the requirements. 

This improves ride comfort and at the same time enhances driving dynamics. 

• Increased body stability and agility 

• Improved driving safety by minimizing wheel load fluctuation and reduced stopping distance. 

The driver can use the driving dynamics control switch to change between a comfortable or sporty as¬ 
pect of the vehicle's character according to his individual requirements. 

6.7.4. Service information 

Other separate lines exist between the dampers, including front axle sensors and the wiring harness. 
These are not shown in the system wiring diagram. These lines can be replaced individually when car¬ 
rying out repairs.
