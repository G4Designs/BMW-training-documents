N55 Engine. 

1. Introduction 

1.1. Highlights 

The N55 engine is the successor to the N54 engine. Re-engineering and modifications have made it 
possible to now use only one exhaust turbocharger. Against the backdrop of reduced costs and im¬ 
proved quality, the technical data have remained virtually the same.

3.1.2. Engine designation 

The engines are marked on the crankcase with an engine identification code for unique identification. 
This engine identifier is also required for approval by the authorities. 

The N55 engine further develops this identification system and the code has been reduced from previ¬ 
ously eight to seven characters. The engine serial number can be found under the engine identifier on 
the engine. Together with the engine identifier, this consecutive number enables unique identification 
of each individual engine.

4. Engine mechanical system. 

4.1. Engine housing 

The engine housing consists of the engine block (crankcase and bedplate), cylinder head, cylinder 
head cover, oil pan and gaskets. 


4.1.1. Engine block 

The engine block is made from an aluminium diecasting and consists of the crankcase with bedplate. 

Crankcase and bedplate 

The crankcase features cast cylinder liners (2) made from cast iron. A new feature is that the webs be¬ 
tween two cylinders now have a groove (3). Coolant can flow along these grooves from one side of the 
crankcase to the other, thus cooling the webs. 

As opposed to the N54 engine, five oil return ducts on the exhaust side (4) now permit oil to return 
from the cylinder head into the oil pan. These oil return channels extend into the bedplate up to below 
the oil deflector. They help reduce churning losses as the returning engine oil can no longer reach the 
crank drive even at high transverse acceleration. 

Five oil return channels on the intake side (5) also ensure that the blow-by gasses can flow unobstruct¬ 
ed from the crankshaft area into the cylinder head and to the crankcase breather in the cylinder head 
cover. 

The cooling duct (1) in the engine block is split and coolant flows directly through it.

Ducts are provided for the oil supply to the vacuum pump as it is now lubricated by filtered oil and not 
by unfiltered oil as on the N54 engine. The oil pressure control valve has been integrated for the map- 
controlled oil pump.

The crankcase has larger bored longitudinal ventilation holes. The longitudinal ventilation holes im¬ 
prove the pressure equalisation of the oscillating air columns that are created by the up and down 
movement of the pistons.

The cylinder head of the N55 engine is a new development. Direct fuel injection with exhaust tur¬ 
bocharging and Valvetronic are used for the first time on a BMW 6-cylinder engine. The cylinder head 
features a very compact design and is equipped with third generation Valvetronic. 

A 

The combination of exhaust turbocharger, Valvetronic and direct fuel injections is referred to as Tur- 
bo-Valvetronic-Direct-Injection (TVDI).

This system reduces CO 2 emission and fuel consumption by 3 - 6 %. 

There are now no connections for the VANOS non-return valves as they have been integrated in the 
solenoid valves. The cylinder head further features cooling channels about the fuel injectors, providing 
indirect cooling.

4.1.3. Cylinder head cover 

Design 

The cylinder head cover is a new development. The vacuum accumulator for the vacuum system is in¬ 
tegrated in the cylinder head cover. 

All components for crankcase ventilation and the blow-by channels are also integrated in the cylinder 
head cover. The integrated non-return valves ensure that the blow-by gasses are reliably added to the 
intake air. 

The N55 engine is equipped with a vacuum-controlled crankcase ventilation system. A regulated neg¬ 
ative pressure of approx. 38 mbar is maintained.

The blow-by gasses flow through the opening in the area of the sixth cylinder into the settling cham¬ 
ber in the cylinder head cover. From the settling chamber, the blow-by gasses are directed through 
holes on to an impact plate, against which the oil impacts, due to the high flow rate, and flows off. The 
blow-by gasses cleaned of oil now flow via the pressure control valve and, depending on the operating 
mode, via the non-return valves into the intake area upstream of the exhaust turbocharger or via the 
cylinder head ahead of the intake valves. The separated oil is directed via a return flow duct to below 
the oil level into the oil pan. 

Function 

The standard function can only be used as long as a vacuum prevails in the intake air manifold, i.e. in 
naturally-aspirated engine mode. 


17 













N55 Engine. 

4. Engine mechanical system. 

With the engine operating in naturally-aspirated mode, the vacuum in the intake air manifold opens the 
non-return valve in the blow-by duct in the cylinder head cover, thus drawing off blow-by gasses via 
pressure control valve. At the same time, the vacuum also closes the second non-return valve in the 
duct to the charge air intake line. 

The blow-by gasses flow via the distributor rail integrated in the cylinder head cover directly into the 
intake channels in the cylinder head.

Index Description 



Blow-by gasses can no longer be introduced via this channel as soon as the pressure in the intake 
air manifold increases. There would otherwise be the danger that the boost pressure could enter the 
crankcase. A non-return valve in the blow-by channel in the cylinder head cover closes the channel to 
the intake air manifold, thus protecting the crankcase from excess pressure. 

The now greater demand for fresh air creates a vacuum in the clean air pipe between the exhaust tur¬ 
bocharger and intake silencer. This vacuum is sufficient to open the non-return valve and to draw off 
the blow-by gasses via the pressure control valve.

A 

If a customer complains about high oil consumption and at the same time the exhaust turbocharger is 
found to be oiled up, it should not be immediately assumed that the exhaust turbocharger is defective. 
If the oiling already exists after the introduction of the blow-by gasses then the entire engine should 
be checked for leaks. Defective gaskets or defective crankshaft seals may be the cause of excessively 
high blow-by gas throughput. Leaking crankshaft seals can cause an oil consumption of up to 3 1/1000 
km. 


4.1.4. Oil pan 

The oil pan is made from an aluminium casting. The oil deflector and the intake pipe to the oil pump 
are designed as one component. To facilitate attachment to the bedplate, the oil return ducts are de¬ 
signed such that they extend over the oil deflector. Consequently, the oil return ducts end in the oil 
sump.

Crankshaft 

The crankshaft is designed with optimum weight. At 20.3 kg, the crankshaft in the N55 engine is ap¬ 
prox. 3 kg lighter than the crankshaft in the N54 engine. The crankshaft is also known as a lightweight 
crankshaft. The crankshaft is made from cast iron (GGG70). The counterweights are arranged asym¬ 
metrically. No incremental wheel is installed. The timing chains are mounted by means of an M18 cen¬ 
tral bolt.

Crankshaft main bearings 

As on the N54 engine, the main bearings on the crankshaft are designed as two-component bearings 
free of lead. The thrust bearing is mounted at the fourth bearing position. 

4.2.2. Connecting rod and bearing 

The size of the connecting rod of the N55 engine is 144.35 mm. A special feature is the formed hole in 
the small connecting rod eye. This formed hole optimally distributes the force acting from the piston 
via the gudgeon pin over the surface of the bush and reduces the load at the edges.

Lead-free big-end bearing shells are used on the large connecting rod eye. The material G-488 is used 
on the connecting rod side and the material G-444 on the bearing cap side. 

The size M9 x 47 connecting rod bolts are the same on the N55 and N54 connecting rod. 

4.2.3. Pistons with piston rings 

A full slipper skirt piston supplied by the company KS is used. The piston diameter is 82.5 mm. The 
first piston ring is a plain rectangular compression ring with a chrome-ceramic coating on the contact 
surface. The second piston ring is a tape faced Napier ring. The oil scrape ring is designed as a steel 
band ring with spring that is also known as VF system.

chamber. It can be seen that the BMW (spray-guided) high precision injection (HPI) system is not used 
but rather a Bosch solenoid valve fuel injector with multi-hole nozzle. The fuel injector is combined 
with turbocharging and Valvetronic III. For better illustration, a valve with valve set has been removed in 
the graphic.

5.1.1. Camshafts 

Cast or lightweight camshafts were used simultaneously on the N54 engine. This made it possible to 
use lightweight camshafts as well as cast camshafts or a mixture of both in an N54 engine. 

Only lightweight construction camshafts are used on the N55 engine. The lightweight camshafts for 
the N55 engine are manufactured in an internal high pressure forming process. The exhaust camshaft 
features bearing races and is encapsulated in a camshaft housing. The camshaft housing reduces oil 
foaming during operation.

5.1.3. Intake and exhaust valves 

The valve stem has a diameter of 5 mm on the intake valve and 6 mm on the exhaust valve. The reason 
for the larger diameter is that the exhaust valve is hollow and is filled with sodium. In addition, the valve 
seat of the exhaust valve is armoured. 

5.1.4. Valve springs 

The valve springs are different for the intake side and exhaust side.

5.2.1. VANOS 

Overview 

The VANOS system has been optimised to provide even faster adjustment speeds of the VANOS 
units. The optimisation has also further reduced the susceptibility to soiling. It can be seen from the 
following comparison of the VANOS on the N54 engine and the VANOS on the N55 engine that fewer 
oil channels are required.

VANOS solenoid valves 

The return shut-off valve with screen filter used on the N54 engine have now been integrated in the 
VANOS solenoid valves on the N55 engine. This measure has made it possible to reduce the number 
of oil ducts in the cylinder head. In addition, the non-return valves have been integrated in the VANOS 
solenoid valves. Screen filters on the VANOS solenoid valve ensure trouble-free operation and reliably 
prevent the VANOS solenoid valve from sticking as the result of dirt particles. 

5.2.2. Valve list adjustment 

Overview 

As can be seen from the following graphic, the installation location of the servomotor has changed. A 
further feature is that the eccentric shaft sensor is no longer mounted on the eccentric shaft but has 
been integrated in the servomotor.

The Valvetronic III system is used. The differences between Valvetronic III and Valvetronic II are in the 
arrangement of the Valvetronic servomotor and the Valvetronic sensor. As in Valvetronic II, the turbu¬ 
lence level is increased in Valvetronic III for the purpose of optimising the mixture formation with phas¬ 
ing and masking at the end of the compression cycle. This movement of the cylinder charge improves 
the combustion during partial load operation and in catalytic converter heating mode. The quench ar¬ 
eas also contribute to mixture formation. 

Phasing 

Phasing results in a lift difference between both intake valves of up to 1.8 mm in the lower partial load 
range. Consequently, the flow of fresh air is distributed asymmetrically. 


36 

















N55 Engine. 

5. Valve gear. 

Masking 

Masking refers to the design of the valve seats. This shaping ensures that the incoming fresh air is 
aligned in such a way as to give rise to the required cylinder charge movement. The advantage of this 
measure is that the combustion retardation is reduced by approx. 10 “crankshaft. The combustion pro¬ 
cess takes place faster and a larger valve overlap can be achieved, thus considerably reducing NO x 
emissions.

The following graphic shows the effect of the previously described measures. These measures 
achieve improved and faster combustion in the red area. Technically, this is known as the turbulent ki¬ 
netic energy.

Engine response is improved by the combination of Valvetronic III, direct injection and turbocharging. 
The response up to naturally aspirated full load is shortened on a naturally aspirated engine with Val¬ 
vetronic as there is now no need wait for the intake air manifold to be filled. The subsequent torque 
build-up as the turbocharger starts up can be accelerated with the partial lift setting at low engine 
speed. This effectively flushes out residual gas, thus resulting in faster torque build-up.

Valvetronic 

A new brushless DC motor is used. The Valvetronic servomotor exhibits the following special features: 

• Open concept (oil through-flow) 

• The eccentric shaft angle is determined by angle increments from the integrated sensor sys¬ 
tem 

• Power intake reduced by approx. 50 % 

• Higher actuating dynamics (e.g. cylinder-selective adjustment, idle speed control, etc.) 

• Weight advantage (approx. 600 gramme) 


39 





















N55 Engine. 

5. Valve gear. 

The third generation Valvetronic servomotor also contains the sensor for determining the position of 
the eccentric shaft. A further feature of the Valvetronic servomotor is that engine oil flows through and 
about it. An oil spray nozzle lubricates the worm drive for the eccentric shaft.

7.1.2. Oil return 

The following graphics show the integrated oil deflector. It combines the following components: 

• Oil deflector 

• Intake snorkel 

The greatest possible partitioning between the oil sump and crank drive is achieved by the integrated 
oil deflector. Oil scraper edges that specifically direct the spray oil from the crank drive are additionally 
provided on the bedplate. 

The adaptation for the required type of oil pan can be simply made by changing the intake snorkel. 

The oil flowing back from the cylinder head is directed under the oil deflector. In this way, no returning 
oil can reach the crankshaft and cause churning losses even under high transverse acceleration condi¬ 
tions.

A modified version of the reciprocating slide oil pump known from the N54 engine is used. For the first 
time a Duroplast reciprocating slide valve is used. The volumetric flow control system known from the 
N53 engine is also used. The operating principle of the oil pump is described in the Product Informa¬ 
tion ”N63 Engine”. The operating principle of the pressure control system is described in the Product 
Information ”N53 Engine”.

The oil pump has been redesigned to cater for the functionality and durability of the Duroplast recipro¬

7.1.4. Oil filtration and oil cooling 

The oil filter housing is made from Duroplast. A separate engine oil cooler is also used for cooling the 
engine oil. Depending on the oil temperature, a thermostat on the oil filter housing releases the oil flow 
to the oil cooler. 

7.1.5. Oil spray nozzles 

The N55 engine is equipped with oil spray nozzles for the purpose of cooling the piston crown. A spe¬ 
cial tool is required for positioning the oil spray nozzles. 

7.1.6. Oil monitoring 

Oil pressure 

Since the N55 engine has an oil pump with volumetric flow control, it is necessary to exactly measure 
the oil pressure. For this reason, a new sensor supplied by the company Sensata is fitted. The N53/ 
N43 engine was equipped with a Honeywell sensor. 

Advantages of the new sensor: 

• Measurement of absolute pressure (previously relative pressure) 

• Characteristic map control possible in all speed ranges. 

Oil level 

The known oil condition sensor is used for the purpose of measuring the oil level.

8. Air intake and exhaust system 

8.1. Air intake system 


8.1.1. Overview 

Several functions have been optimised for the N55 engine: 

• Unfiltered air routed up to the intake silencer (adopted from the N54 engine) 

• Filtered air duct completely new and simplified to accommodate the new exhaust turbocharg¬ 
er 

• Crankcase ventilation 

• Diverter valve system integrated in exhaust turbocharger 

• Fuel tank ventilation correspondingly adapted. 


As can be seen from the graphics, the design layout of the air intake system has been simplified as on¬ 
ly one turbocharger is used.

The basic function of the diverter valve remains the same. The difference compared to the N54 engine 
is that the diverter valve is not operated pneumatically. The diverter valve on the N55 engine is an elec¬ 
tric actuator that is controlled directly by the DME. The number of components has been greatly re¬ 
duced by positioning the diverter valve on the exhaust turbocharger. The diverter valve can connect 
the intake side to the pressure side. 

As on the N54 engine, the undesirable peaks in the boost pressure that can occur when the throttle 
valve closes fast are reduced. This means the diverter valve plays an important role in terms of the en¬ 
gine acoustics while protecting the components of the exhaust turbocharger. The detailed operating 
principle is described in the Product Information ”N54 Engine”. 

8.1.2. Air intake system 

As can be seen in the following graphic, the engine control unit is mounted on the intake system. The 
intake air is also used to cool the engine control unit. 

Thanks to this arrangement, the engine can already be assembled with the control unit and the sen¬ 
sors and actuators connected to the engine in production.

8.2.1. Overview 

With the twin scroll exhaust turbocharger, the design of the exhaust system is less complicated than 
that for the N54 engine with two exhaust turbochargers. In addition to a near-engine catalytic convert¬ 
er (3), the exhaust system also features a centre silencer (4) and two rear silencers (5 + 6).

The exhaust manifold is air-gap insulated and designed as a six into two manifold. Combining three 
exhaust channels each into one exhaust channel is necessary in order to ensure optimum flow to the 
twin scroll exhaust turbocharger. The exhaust manifold and exhaust turbocharger are welded together 
to form one component.

Function of the twin scroll exhaust turbocharger 

A constant exhaust gas pressure is applied to the exhaust turbocharger only rarely. At low engine 
speeds, the exhaust reaches the exhaust turbine in pulsating form. Due to this pulsation, a higher pres¬ 
sure ratio is temporarily reached in the exhaust turbine. Since the efficiency increases as the pressure 
rises, the pulsation also improves the boost pressure progression and thus the torque progression of 
the engine. This is the case particularly at low engine speeds. 

To ensure the individual cylinders do not mutually influence each other during the cylinder charge 
change process, cylinders 1 - 3 (cylinder bank 1) and cylinders 4-6 (cylinder bank 2) are each com¬ 
bined to form one exhaust channel. The flow of exhaust gas in the turbocharger is directed in scrolls 
(spirals) to the exhaust turbine via the exhaust channels (1 + 2). This design layout makes it possible to 
optimally use the pulsations for generating boost pressure. 

The known wastegate valve is used for the purpose of limiting the boost pressure. 

8.2.4. Catalytic converter 

Two ceramic monoliths are contained in the catalytic converter housing. The catalytic converter has a 
volume of 2.7 litres. Depending on the type of vehicle the ceramic monoliths have different coatings. 

Ceramic monolith 1 has a volume of 1.2 litres, a diameter of 125 mm and contains 600 cells. 

Ceramic monolith 2 has a volume of 1.5 litres, a diameter of 125 mm and contains 400 cells.

9. Vacuum system. 

9.1. Design 

The N55 engine is equipped with a vacuum pump for generating the vacuum required by the brake 
booster and the auxiliary load. This auxiliary load on the F07 is the wastegate valve. A vacuum accu¬ 
mulator is used to ensure there is sufficient vacuum for the wastegate valve at all times.

The largest part of the space expansion (evacuation) is used for the first stage, ensuring vacuum is 
built up at a rapid rate for the brake booster. Only in the last section is the opening for the auxiliary load 
released, i.e. the second stage cuts in. It therefore takes longer to build up the vacuum here, as shown 
in the following diagram.

10. Fuel preparation. 

10.1. Overview 

The high pressure fuel injection system (HDE) is used on the N55 engine. In contrast to high precision 
injection (HPI) solenoid fuel injectors with multi-hole nozzles are used. 

The following overview shows the complete fuel preparation system. The fuel preparation system used 
on the N55 engine is similar to the fuel preparation system of the N54 engine. For instance, the same 
high pressure pump is used. The high pressure fuel injection valves are new. Bosch high pressure fuel 
injection valves with the designation HDEV5.2 are used.

10.1.1. Fuel pressure sensor 

The fuel is conveyed at a primary pressure of 5 bar by the electric fuel pump from the fuel tank via the 
supply line to the high pressure pump. The primary pressure is monitored by the fuel pressure sensor. 
The fuel is delivered by the electric fuel pump corresponding to requirements. The fuel pressure sen¬ 
sor known from the N54, N53 and N63 engine is used. 

In the event of the fuel pressure sensor failing, the electric fuel pump continues operation at 100 % de¬ 
livery rate as from terminal 15 ON.

10.1.2. High pressure pump 

The fuel is pressurised in the permanently driven three-piston high pressure pump and delivered to 
the fuel rail via the high pressure line. The fuel stored under pressure in the fuel rail is distributed via 
the high pressure lines to the high pressure fuel injection valves. The required fuel pressure is deter¬ 
mined by the engine management as a function of the engine load and engine speed. The pressure 
level is registered by the rail pressure sensor and sent to the engine control unit. The fuel is regulated 
by the quantity control valve based on a target/actual value comparison of the rail pressure. The pres¬ 
sure level is configures such to achieve the best possible fuel consumption and smooth running prop¬ 
erties of the N55 engine. A pressure of 200 bar is only required at high load and low engine speed. The 
high pressure pump is of the same design as the high pressure pump used on the N53 and N54 en¬ 
gines.

Warning information for working on the high pressure system 


10.1.3. Fuel injectors 

The high pressure fuel injection valve HDEV5.2 from Bosch is a solenoid valve fuel injector. In contrast 
to the piezo-injector used on the current BMW engines, the solenoid valve fuel injector is designed as 
an inward-opening multi-hole valve with highly variable jet angle and jet form. The solenoid valve fuel 
injector is designed for a system pressure of up to 200 bar. 

A 

Work should only be carried out on the fuel system after the engine has cooled down. The coolant 
temperature must not be more than 40 °C. These requirements must be observed otherwise the resid¬ 
ual pressure in the high pressure fuel system could cause fuel to spray out. 

It is essential to observe the utmost cleanliness when working on the high pressure fuel system and 
follow the working procedures described in the repair instructions. Even minute soiling and damage at 
the screw connections of the high pressure lines could cause leaks. 

Particular care must be taken when working on the fuel system of the N55 engine to ensure that the 
ignition coils are not soiled with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by con¬ 
tact with fuel. This could result in sparkover at the top of the spark plug and misfiring. 

• Before working on the fuel system, remove the ignition coils and use a rag to prevent fuel en¬ 
tering the spark plug well. 

• The ignition coils must be removed before installing new solenoid valve fuel injectors and ut¬ 
most cleanliness must be observed. 

• Ignition coils that have been heavily soiled with fuel must be replaced.

11. Cooling system. 

11.1. Overview 

The cooling system of the N55 engine consists of a coolant cooling system and an oil cooling system. 
Depending on the version, different types of oil cooling system are used. In the hot climate variant, 
heat transfer from the engine oil to the coolant area of the engine is avoided by decoupling the oil cool¬ 
er from the coolant circuit.

The coolant ducts in the cylinder head are now also used for indirect cooling of the fuel injectors. The 
following graphic clearly shows that the coolant flows over the valves and the fuel injectors, thus re¬ 
ducing the heat transfer to the components to a minimum.

For the first time, an engine-mounted Digital Motor Electronics (DME) module is used. The DME is 
flanged to the intake manifold and is cooled by the intake air. The near-engine DME has the following 
advantages: 

• Engine wiring harness divided into six individual modules 

• All electrical components on the engine supplied directly via the DME 

• No E-box 

• 211 pins are available, the plug-in connections are water-tight

12.1.3. Engine control unit 

The N55 engine is equipped with the Bosch engine management MEVD17.2. The MEVD17.2 is inte¬ 
grated in the intake system and is cooled by the intake air. The MEVD17.2 is FlexRay-compatible and 
directly supplies voltage to the sensors and actuators. 

The top side of the DME housing also serves as the bottom section of the intake system. The housing 
is contoured in the area of the intake manifold to ensure optimum flow through the intake system. 

The plug connections between the wiring harness and DME are water-tight.

12.2. Functions 


12.2.1. Fuel supply system 

The fuel pressure sensor sends a voltage signal, corresponding to the system pressure applied be¬ 
tween the fuel pump and the high pressure pump, to the engine control unit (DME control unit). The 
system pressure (fuel pressure) is determined with the fuel pressure sensor upstream of the high pres¬ 
sure pump. The target pressure is constantly compared to the actual pressure in the DME control unit. 


90 















N55 Engine. 

12. Engine electrical system. 

If the target pressure deviates from the actual pressure, the engine control unit increases or decreases 
the voltage for the electric fuel pump. This voltage is sent in the form of a message via the PT-CAN to 
the EKP control unit. 

The electric fuel pump (EKP) control unit converts the message into an output voltage for the electric 
fuel pump, thus regulating the required delivery pressure for the engine (or high pressure pump). The 
electric fuel pump is pilot-controlled in the event of signal failure (fuel pressure sensor). Should the 
CAN bus fail the EKP control unit operates the electric fuel pump with the applied system voltage. The 
high pressure pump increases the fuel pressure to 50 and 200 bar. The fuel flows via the high pressure 
line to the fuel rail. The fuel is buffered in the fuel rail and distributed to the fuel injectors. 

Fuel quantity control 

The rail pressure sensor measures the current fuel pressure in the rail. The excess fuel is returned to 
the inlet to the high pressure pump when the quantity control valve in the high pressure pump opens. 
Restricted vehicle operation is possible in the event of the high pressure pump failing. 

The quantity control valve controls the fuel pressure in the rail. The engine management actuates the 
quantity control valve with a pulse width-modulated signal. Depending on the pulse width, a variable 
throttle cross section is released, thus providing the quantity of fuel required for the current load status 
of the engine. It is additionally possible to reduce the pressure in the rail. 

12.2.2. Boost pressure control 

The engine management controls the boost pressure with the wastegate valve at the exhaust tur¬ 
bocharger. An electropneumatic pressure converter which converts the signals from the engine man¬ 
agement and defined vacuum is used to adjust the wastegate valve infinitely variable with vacuum. 

A diverter valve is flanged to the exhaust turbocharger. This diverter valve can control the engine man¬ 
agement directly, thus establishing a connection between the intake side and the pressure side. The 
diverter valve can eliminate undesirable peaks in the boost pressure that can occur when the throt¬ 
tle valve is closed quickly. The diverter valve therefore has a decisive influence on the engine acous¬ 
tics while protecting the components of the exhaust turbocharger. A pressure wave is built up from the 
throttle valve to the exhaust turbocharger when the throttle valve is closed. This pressure wave comes 
up against the turbine blades in the exhaust turbocharger and presses them against the bearings. The 
diverter valve substantially reduces this pressure wave and thus the load on the exhaust turbocharger. 


12.2.3. Engine cooling 

The advantages of the conventional cooling system are utilised for the cooling system with elec¬ 
tric coolant pump. The heat management determines the current cooling requirement and controls 
the cooling system accordingly. Under certain circumstances, the coolant pump can be completely 
switched off, e.g. to rapidly heat up the coolant during the warm-up phase. The coolant pump contin¬ 
ues to operate when the hot engine is shut down. The coolant capacity can therefore be varied irre¬ 
spective of the engine speed. In addition to the characteristic map thermostat, the heat management 
makes it possible to use various characteristic maps for controlling the coolant pump. In this way the 
engine control unit can adapt the engine temperature to the driving conditions. 

The engine control unit regulates the following temperature ranges: 


91 



N55 Engine. 

12. Engine electrical system. 


• 108 °C = Economy mode 

• 104 °C = Normal mode 

• 95 °C = High mode 

• 90 °C = High mode and control with characteristic map thermostat 

The engine management sets a higher temperature (108 °C) when, based on vehicle operation, the 
engine control unit detects ’’Economy” mode. The engine is operated with relatively low fuel require¬ 
ments in this temperature range. The internal engine friction is reduced at higher temperatures. The 
increase in temperature therefore realises low fuel consumption in the low load range. The driver wish¬ 
es to utilise the optimum power developed by the engine in ’’High and control with characteristic map 
thermostat” mode. For this purpose, the temperature in the cylinder head is reduced to 90 °C. This 
temperature reduction promotes improved volumetric efficiency, thus resulting in an increased engine 
torque. Adapted to the relevant driving situation, the engine control unit can now regulate a defined 
operating range. In this way it is possible to influence the fuel consumption and power output through 
the cooling system. 

12.2.4. System protection 

If the coolant or engine oil overheat during engine operation, certain vehicle functions are influenced to 
the effect that more energy is available to the engine cooling system. 

These measures are divided over two operating modes: 

• Component protection 

Coolant temperature between 117 °C and 124 °C 
Engine oil temperature between 150 °C and 157 °C 

Result: the output of the air conditioning system (up to 100 %) and of the engine is reduced 

• Emergency 

Coolant temperature between 125 °C and 129 °C 

Engine oil temperature between 158 °C and 163 °C 

Result: the power output of the engine is reduced (up to approx. 90 %). 


12.3. Sensors 


12.3.1. Crankshaft sensor 

The function of the new integrated crankshaft sensor is identical to that of the crankshaft sensors used 
for the automatic engine start-stop function (MSA). The engine reversal detection is required for the 
MSA function. The sensor and function are described in the Product Information ”N47 Engine”.

12.3.2. Ignition coil and spark plug 

Ignition coil 

A new ignition coil has been developed for the N55 engine. The ignition coil provides a higher ignition 
voltage, improved electromagnetic compatibility and is sturdier. 

A 

The ignition voltage of the secondary coil on the N43 and N53 engines is reversed. This is achieved by 
reverse actuation and a diode in the secondary circuit. The positive polarisation extends spark propa¬ 
gation, thus improving the flammability of the mixture. This feature is only required in stratified charge 
mode. Since the air/fuel mixture is homogeneous on the N55 engine, the ’’normal” ignition coil is used. 


Spark plug 

The N55 engine is equipped with the spark plug that is a common part with the N63 engine and N74 
engine. The strength has been improved and the voltage strength increased by improved ceramics. 

12.3.3. Oil pressure sensor 

The new oil pressure sensor can now determine the absolute pressure. This is required for more accu¬ 
rate oil pressure control. The sensor design is identical to that of the fuel pressure sensor.

A new connector is used for the oxygen sensors. The new connector system provides greatly im¬ 
proved contacting properties and eliminates ’’background noise” caused by contacting problems. The 
vibration-free contact point represents a further improvement.

Oxygen sensor before catalytic converter 

The Bosch oxygen sensor LSU ADV is used as the control sensor before the catalytic converter. The 
function is comparable with that of the oxygen sensor LSU 4.9 and is therefore not described in detail 
here. This oxygen sensor is already used on the N63 engine. The abbreviation LSU stands for 'Lamb- 
dasonde Universal' and ADV for Advanced. 

The oxygen sensor before catalytic converter (LSU ADV) offers the following advantages: 

• High signal stability specially during turbocharged operation thanks to low dynamic pressure 
dependence 

• Increased durability due to reduced pump voltage 

• Increased accuracy (by a factor of 1.7 compared to LSU 4.9) 

• Ready for operation faster < 5 seconds 

• Greater temperature compatibility 

• Improved system connector with more effective contacting properties 

The LSU ADV has an extended measuring range, making it possible to measure precisely from lambda 
0.65. The new oxygen sensor is ready for operation faster so that exact measured values are already 
available after 5 seconds. 

The measuring dynamics of the sensor are higher, making it possible to determine and therefore also 
control the fuel-air ratio separately in each cylinder. Consequently, the flow of exhaust gas is homoge¬ 
neous, the emission values can be reduced and the long-term emissions characteristics optimised. 

Oxygen sensor after catalytic converter 

The oxygen sensor after catalytic converter is also known as the monitoring sensor. The known Bosch 
LSF 4.2 minitoring sensor is used. 


12.3.5. Hot-film air mass meter 

The Siemens SIMAF GT2 hot-film air mass meter is used. The Siemens SIMAF GT2 air mass meter is 
equipped with planar metal resistors on glass. This technology has been used in the SIMAF GT1 for 
more than 15 years. Based on this tried and tested sensor technology, the SIMAF GT2 represents a 
consistent further-development and optimisation with higher vibration resistance, improved accuracy 
at all operating temperatures and lower sensitivity to water and pulsations.

12.4.1. Valvetronic servomotor 

A brushless direct current motor (BLDC motor) is used as the Valvetronic servomotor. Thanks to the 
contactless energy transfer system, the BLCD motor is maintenance-free and very powerful. The use 
of integrated electronic modules ensures precision control. 

Function 

Actuation of the Valvetronic servomotor is limited to maximum 40 amps. A maximum of 20 amps is 
available over a period of > 200 milliseconds. The Valvetronic servomotor is actuated by a pulse width- 
modulated signal. The duty cycle is between 5 % and 98 %.

The DME supplies the sensor with a voltage of 5 Volt. The DME receives signals via five Hall elements 
and evaluates them. Three of the five Hall sensors are used for rough division and two for fine subdivi¬ 
sion. In this way, the angle of rotation of the servomotor can be determined to < 7.5°. Together with the 
step-up ratio of the worm drive, very accurate and fast lift adjustment of the valve can be achieved in 
this way. 

12.4.2. High pressure fuel injection valve 

The HDEV5.2 used on the N55 engine is a new development based on the HDEV5.1 high pressure fu¬ 
el injection valve used on the N14 engine. The function is the same. 

Function 

The HDEV5.2 is actuated in four phases as shown in the following graphic.

1 Booster phase: Opening of the HDEV5.2 is initiated in the booster phase by a high booster volt¬ 
age from the DME. The booster phase ends on reaching approx. 10 amps. The high current is 
achieved by a voltage of up to approx. 65 Volt. 

2 Energisation phase: In the energisation phase, the HDEV5.2 is completely opened by control¬ 
ling the current to approx. 6.2 amps. At the end of the energisation phase, the current is reduced 
from the energisation to the holding current level of approx. 2.5 amps. 

3 Hold phase: The energised HDEV5.2 is kept open by controlling the current at approx. 2.5 amps 
in the hold phase. 

4 Switch off phase: The current is switched off at the end of the injection time in the switch off 
phase. At least 2 milliseconds elapse between two injection cycles.

If a customer complains about high oil consumption and at the same time the exhaust turbocharg¬ 
er is found to be oiled up, it should not be immediately assumed that the exhaust turbocharger is de¬ 
fective. If the oiling already exists after the introduction of the blow-by gasses then the entire engine 
should be checked for leaks. Defective gaskets or defective crankshaft seals may be the cause of ex¬ 
cessively high blow-by gas throughput. Leaking crankshaft seals can cause an oil consumption of up 
to 3 1/1000 km. 


13.2. Fuel conditioning system 

13.2.1. Overview 

Fuel injectors 

A 

Work should only be carried out on the fuel system after the engine has cooled down. The coolant 
temperature must not be more than 40 °C. These requirements must be observed otherwise the resid¬ 
ual pressure in the high pressure fuel system could cause fuel to spray out. 

It is essential to observe the utmost cleanliness when working on the high pressure fuel system and 
follow the working procedures described in the repair instructions. Even minute soiling and damage at 
the screw connections of the high pressure lines could cause leaks. 

Particular care must be taken when working on the fuel system of the N55 engine to ensure that the 
ignition coils are not soiled with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by con¬ 
tact with fuel. This could result in sparkover at the top of the spark plug and misfiring.

13. Service information. 


Before working on the fuel system, remove the ignition coils and use a rag to prevent fuel en¬ 
tering the spark plug well. 

The ignition coils must be removed before installing new solenoid valve fuel injectors and ut¬ 
most cleanliness must be observed. 

Ignition coils that have been heavily soiled with fuel must be replaced.

13.3.1. Ignition coil and spark plug 

Ignition coil 

A 

The ignition voltage of the secondary coil on the N43 and N53 engines is reversed. This is achieved by 
reverse actuation and a diode in the secondary circuit. The positive polarisation extends spark propa¬ 
gation, thus improving the flammability of the mixture. This feature is only required in stratified charge 
mode. Since the air/fuel mixture is homogeneous on the N55 engine, the ’’normal” ignition coil is used.
