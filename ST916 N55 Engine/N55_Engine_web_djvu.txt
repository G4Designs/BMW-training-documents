N55 Engine 


Introduction 


The N55 engine is the successor to the N54. Re-engineering and modifications have 
made it possible to now use only one exhaust turbocharger. Against the backdrop of 
reduced costs and improved guality, the technical data have remained virtually the same. 


N55 Engine

N55 Engine 






Engine Components/Systems Overview 

The following provides an overview of the features of the N55 engine: 

Crankcase: 

• Large longitudinal ventilation holes inter-connect the crankcase lower chambers 
and relieve unwanted crankcase pressure between cylinders. 

• Modified oil galleries enhance the supply of oil to vacuum pump. 

Crankshaft: Is lightweight design and has an asymmetric counterweight arrangement. 

Pistons and connecting rods: 

• A specially formed bushing/bore in small end of the connecting rods evenly 
distributes the force of the pistons on the power stroke. 

• Lead-free bearing shells are installed on the big-end of the connecting rods. 

Cylinder head: 

• Specially designed water passages intergraded into the cylinder head enhance 
injector cooling. 

• The combustion chambers are machined to work in conjuction with the Valvetronic 
III system with regard to promoting air turbulence and mixture formation. 

Crankcase ventilation: 

• In contrast to the N54, the N55 crankcase ventilation does not use cyclone 
separators. 

• The cylinder and head cover have integrated blow-by passages that connect the 
crankcase ventilation directly to the intake ports. 

VANOS: 

• The N55 VANOS oil passages are simplified compared to the N54 engine. 

• The solenoid valves have integrated non-return valve and 3 screen filters. 

• The VANOS units are of a lightweight design for increased adjustment speed 
and have a reduced susceptibility to soiling. 

Valvetrain: 

• The N55 is the first BMW turbo engine to incorporate Valvetronic. 

• The valvetrain is a new designed that combines Valvetronic III with Double VANOS. 

• With Valvetronic III the 3rd generation brushless servomotor is introduced. 

• The position detection sensor of eccentric shaft is now integrated in the servomotor. 

6 

N55 Engine 



Oil supply: 

• An enhanced and simplified oil circuit design is used. 

• The inlet pipe, oil deflector, and oil collector are combined in one component. 

• Oil pump uses a Duroplast slide valve and it is electronically controlled based on 
a characteristic map within the engine management. 

Forced induction: 

• The N55 uses a single twin scroll turbocharger with vacuum operated, 
electronically controlled wastegate valve. 

• The electric diverter valve is intergraded into the turbocharger compressor housing. 

Air intake and exhaust system: 

• Air intake system is similar in configuration as the N54 with the exception of the 
intake manifold and the use of a single turbo. 

• The intercooler is an air to air type mounted in the lower area of the front bumper 
cover. 

• The exhaust system uses no underbody catalytic converter. 

Vacuum system: 

• The N55 engine has a two-stage vacuum pump as on the N54. 

• The vacuum system has the vacuum reservoir built into the cylinder head cover. 

Fuel injection: 

• HDE (high pressure fuel injection) system is installed on the N55. 

• The HDE system uses solenoid valve fuel injectors instead of the piezoelectric 
type used on HPI. 

• The high pressure pump and pressure sensors are similar in design and function 
in both the HDE and HPI systems. 

Digital Motor Electronics (DME): 

• The DME is mounted on the intake manifold and cooled by intake air. 

• The location of the DME facilitates the installation of the N55 engine in several 
current BMW platforms/models.

Engine Identification 

The engines are marked on the crankcase with an engine identification code for unigue 
identification. This engine identifier is also reguired for approval by the authorities. The 
N55 engine further develops this identification system and the code has been reduced 
from previously eight to seven characters. The engine serial number can be found under 
the engine identifier on the engine. Together with the engine identifier, this consecutive 
number enables unigue identification of each individual engine.

Engine Components 


Engine Housing 

The engine housing consists of the engine block (crankcase and bedplate), cylinder 
head, cylinder head cover, oil pan and gaskets. 

Engine Block 

The engine block is made from an aluminum die-casting and consists of the crankcase 
with bedplate. 

Crankcase and Bedplate 

The crankcase features cast iron cylinder liners (2). A new feature is that the webs 
between two cylinders on the deck of the block now have a grooved cooling passage 
(3). Coolant can flow along these grooves from one side of the crankcase to the other, 
thus enhancing cooling of this area. 

Five oil return ducts on the exhaust side (4) now permit oil to return from the cylinder 
head into the oil pan. These oil return channels extend into the bedplate up to below the 
oil deflector. They help reduce churning losses as the returning engine oil can no longer 
reach the crankshaft even at high transverse acceleration. 

Five oil return channels on the intake side (5) also ensure that the blow-by gasses can 
flow unobstructed from the crankshaft area into the cylinder head and to the crankcase 
breather in the cylinder head cover. 

The cooling duct (1) in the engine block is split and coolant flows directly through it.

The crankcase has large longitudinal ventilation holes bored between the lower chambers 
of the cylinders. The longitudinal ventilation holes improve the pressure egualization, 
between the oscillating air columns that are created in the crankcase, by the up and down 
movement of the pistons. 

This enhances power by relieving the unwanted pressure that acts against the downward 
movement of the pistons. It also enhances crankcase ventilation and adds to oil service 
life by promoting the movement of blow-by gasses within the engine. 



16 

N55 Engine 




Crankshaft 


The crankshaft of the N55 is of lightweight design, at 20.3 kg it’s approximately 3 kg 
lighter than the crankshaft in the N54 engine. 

The crankshaft is made from cast iron (GGG70). The counterweights are arranged asym¬ 
metrically. There is no incremental wheel installed on the crankshaft. The timing chains 
are mounted by means of an Ml 8 central bolt.

Crankshaft Main Bearings 

As on the N54 engine, the main bearings on the crankshaft are designed as two 
component bearings free of lead. The thrust bearing is mounted at the fourth bearing 
position.

N55 Engine 
























Pistons and Rings 

A full slipper skirt type piston with a diameter of 82.5 mm is used. The first piston ring is a 
plain rectangular compression ring with a chrome-ceramic coating on the contact surface. 
The second piston ring is a tapered faced Napier type ring. The oil scrape ring is 
designed as a steel band ring with spring that is also known as VF system.

Connecting Rod and Bearings 

The size of the connecting rod of the N55 engine is 144.35 mm. A new feature is the 
specially formed hole in the small end of the connecting rod. This formed hole is 
machined wider on the lower edges of the wrist pin bushing/bore. This design evenly 
distributes the force acting on the wrist pin over the entire surface of the rod bushing and 
reduces the load at the edges, as the piston is forced downward on the power stroke.

The following graphic shows the surface load on a standard connecting rod without the

Lead-free bearing shells are used on the large connecting rod end. The material G-488 is 
used on the connecting rod side and the material G-444 on the bearing cap side. 

The size M9 x 47 connecting rod bolts are the same on the N55 and N54 connecting 
rod. 


21 

N55 Engine 








Oil Pan 


The oil pan is made from an aluminum casting. The oil deflector and the intake pipe to 
the oil pump are designed as one component. To facilitate attachment to the bedplate, 
the oil return ducts are designed so that they extend over the oil deflector. Consequently, 
the oil return ducts end in the oil sump. 

Ducts are provided for the oil supply to the vacuum pump as it is now lubricated by 
filtered oil and not by unfiltered oil as on the N54 engine.

Electrionic Volume-controlled Oil Pump 

A modified version of the volume control oil pump of the N54 engine is used. For the first 
time a Duroplast reciprocating slide valve is installed. The volumetric flow control system 
operating principle of the oil pump is described in the E71 X6 training material under the 
”N63 Engine” available on TIS and ICR 

This type of pump delivers only as much oil as is necessary under the respective engine 
operating conditions. No surplus guantities of oil are delivered in low-load operating 
ranges. This operating mode reduces the pump work and therefore the fuel consumption 
of the engine while also slowing down the oil aging process. The pump is designed as a 
slide valve-type vane pump. In delivery mode, the pump shaft is positioned off-center in 
the housing and the vanes are displaced radially during rotation. As a result, the vanes 
form chambers of differing volume. The oil is drawn in as the volume increases and 
expelled into the oil galleries as the volume decreases. 

The oil pressure in the system (downstream of the oil filter) acts on the slide against the 
force of a compression springs in the control oil chamber. The slide element rotates 
about a pivot axis.

Oil Pump and Pressure Control 

The oil pump has been redesigned with regard to the functionality and durability of the 
Duroplast reciprocating slide valve. The oil pump used in the N55 engine is a further 
development of the shuttle slide valve volume control oil pump. The activation of the oil 
pump is adapted by the engine management and controlled through an oil pressure 
control valve. 

The delivered oil volume is controlled by means of the oil pressure, based on specific 
reguirements. The modifications, compared to previous pumps, are primarily in the pump 
activation system. The oil pressure no longer acts directly on the control piston but rather 
directly on the slide valve. The engine management activates the electrohydraulic 
pressure control valve, which affects the oil pressure at the slide valve control mechanism 
within the oil pump, altering the pump output. This has the advantage of avoiding power 
losses by running the oil pump only when needed. 

The electrohydraulic pressure control valve controls the pump output and is bolted to the 
front of the engine block. It is operated based on a characteristic map within the DME 
(ECM) which in turn is based on feedback from the oil pressure sensor. The N55 uses a 
special oil pressure sensor for this purpose which functions in the similar way as the HPI 
fuel pressure sensor.

N55 Engine 



























The oil pressure generated by the oil pump (2) is delivered to the engine’s lubricating 
points and hydraulic actuators. This system uses oil pressure feed back to control the 
desired operating oil pressure. For this purpose, the oil pressure downstream of the oil 
filter (7) and engine oil-to-coolant heat exchanger (9) is adjusted by the DME (map-con¬ 
trolled) via the pressure control valve (4) to the pressure control valve (3). 

The actual generated oil pressure is registered by the oil pressure sensor (10) and 
recognized by the engine management. 

In the event of an electrical malfunction, the oil pressure is set to the default control 
setting. The pump compression springs are allowed to expand, moving the slide valve to 
its maximum oil pressure position.

Oil Supply 

The following graphics show an overview of the oil circuit of the N55. Compared to the 
N54 engine, there are considerably fewer oil ducts in the cylinder head. This is mainly due 
to the use of the new VANOS solenoid valves.

Oil Filtration and Oil Cooling 

The oil filter housing is made from Duroplast. Based on the application, two types of 
engine oil coolers may be used. Depending on the oil temperature, a thermostat on the 
oil filter housing controls the oil flow through the oil cooler. 


30 

N55 Engine 






































Oil Spray Nozzles 

The N55 engine is equipped with oil spray nozzles for the purpose of cooling the piston 
crown. A special tool is required for positioning the oil spray nozzles. 

Oil Pressure 

Since the N55 engine has an oil pump with electronic volumetric flow control, it is neces¬ 
sary to measure the oil pressure precisely. For this reason, a new oil pressure sensor is 
installed. 

Advantages of the new oil pressure sensor: 

• It now measures absolute pressure (previous measured relative pressure). 

• It is characteristic map control in all speed ranges. 

Oil Level 

The oil quality sensor is used for measuring the oil level as on previous BMW engines. 

Oil Return 

The following graphics show the integrated oil deflector. It combines the following 
components: 

• Oil deflector (4) 

• Intake snorkel (5) 

The oil sump (1) and crankshaft are separated by the integrated oil deflector. Oil scraper 
edges are installed on the bedplate to direct the spray oil from the crankshaft. 

Depending on the model, the oil pan can be adapted to different installation configura¬ 
tions by simply changing the intake snorkel. The oil, flowing back from the cylinder head 
(2, 6) is directed under the oil deflector. In this way, even under high transverse accelera¬ 
tion conditions, no returning oil can reach the crankshaft and cause churning losses . 



31 

N55 Engine 








Cylinder Head 

Direct fuel injection, turbocharging and Valvetronic systems are combined for the first time 
on a BMW 6-cylinder engine. The cylinder head of the N55 engine is a new develop¬ 
ment. It features a very compact design and is eguipped with third generation Valvetronic. 

The combination is referred to as Turbo-Valvetronic-Direct-Injection (TVDI). 

This system reduces C02 emission and fuel consumption by 3 - 6%. 

There are now no connections for the VANOS non-return valves as they have been 
integrated in the solenoid valves. The cylinder head also features cooling passages 
near the fuel injectors; providing indirect cooling.

Cylinder Head Cover 

The cylinder head cover is a new development. The accumulator for the vacuum system 
is built into the cylinder head cover. 

All components for crankcase ventilation and the blow-by channels are also integrated 
into the cylinder head cover. The non-return valves ensure that the blow-by gasses are 
reliably added to the intake air in both engine modes (NA and Boost) 

The N55 engine is eguipped with a vacuum-controlled crankcase ventilation system; 
therefore, a regulated negative pressure of approximately 38 mbar is maintained.

N55 Engine 

















Crankcase Ventilation 


The blow-by gasses flow into the settling chamber of the cylinder head cover through an 
opening located in the rear of the cover. Here, the blow-by gasses are directed through 
holes on to an impact plate, against which the oil impacts at high speed, and drains off. 
The blow-by gasses, cleaned of oil, flow via the pressure control valve (depending on the 
operating mode) through the non-return valves into the inlet pipe upstream of the 
turbocharger, or via passages in the cylinder head ahead of the intake valves. The sepa¬ 
rated oil is drained via a return flow duct into the oil pan. 

Naturally Aspirated Mode 

The standard function can only be used as long as a vacuum prevails in the intake air 
manifold, i.e. in naturally-aspirated engine mode. 

With the engine operating in naturally-aspirated mode, the vacuum in the intake air mani¬ 
fold opens the non-return valve (15) in the blow-by duct within the cylinder head cover. 
This draws off blow-by gasses via the pressure control valve. At the same time, the vacu¬ 
um also closes the second non-return valve (12) in the duct to the charge air intake pipe. 

The blow-by gasses flow via a distribution rail integrated in the cylinder head cover, 
through the intake passages (16) in the cylinder head, which lead directly into the intake 
ports, ahead of the valves.

Boost Mode 

As the pressure in the intake air manifold increases in boost mode, blow-by gasses can 
no longer be introduced via the passages in the cylinder head, otherwise, the boost pres¬ 
sure could enter the crankcase. A non-return valve (15) in the blow-by channel within the 
cylinder head cover closes the connection (16) to the intake air manifold. This protects 
the crankcase from excess pressure. 

The increased demand for fresh air creates a vacuum in the clean air pipe between the 
turbocharger and intake silencer. This vacuum is sufficient to open the non-return valve 
(12) and draw the blow-by gasses via the pressure control valve.

Intake and Exhaust Valves 

The valve stems have a diameter of 5 mm on the intake valve and 6 mm on the exhaust 
valve. The larger diameter exhaust valve are hollow and filled with sodium. In addition, the 
valve seat of the exhaust valves are reinforced. 

Valve Springs 

The valve springs are different for the intake side and exhaust side.

Camshafts 


Lightweight camshafts as well as cast camshafts or a mixture of both were installed in 
N54 engines. Only lightweight construction camshafts are used on the N55 engine. 

The lightweight camshafts for the N55 are manufactured in an internal high pressure 
forming process called hydroforming. The exhaust camshaft features bearing races and 
is encapsulated in a camshaft housing. The camshaft housing reduces oil foaming during 
operation.

Overview 

The VANOS system has been optimized to provide even faster adjustment speeds of the 
VANOS units. The aluminum VANOS units are much lighter and are also less susceptible 
to soiling. It can be seen by comparing the N54 VANOS system with the N55 VANOS 
that fewer oil passages are required and that the non-return valves are no longer on the 
cylinder head but rather incorporated into the solenoid valves on N55.

VANOS Solenoid Valves 

The non-return valve with screen filter used on the N54 engine have now been integrat¬ 
ed in the VANOS solenoid valves on the N55 engine. This measure has made it possible 
to reduce the number of oil ducts in the cylinder head. The screen filters on the VANOS 
solenoid valve ensure trouble-free operation and reliably prevent the VANOS solenoid 
valve from sticking due to dirt particles. 

Cam Sensor Wheels 

The sensor wheels are now “deep-drawn” sheet metal components and no longer made 
from two parts. This design increases production accuracy while reducing manufacturing 
costs.

Valvetronic III 


The main differences between Valvetronic III and Valvetronic II are in the arrangement of 
the Valvetronic servomotor and the Valvetronic sensor. As in Valvetronic II, the turbulence 
level is increased at the end of the compression cycle for the purpose of optimizing the 
mixture formation with the use of phasing and masking measures. This movement of the 
cylinder charge improves the combustion during partial load operation and in catalytic 
converter heating mode. The quench areas also contribute to mixture formation. 

Phasing 

Phasing results in a lift difference between both intake valves of up to 1.8 mm in the 
lower partial load range. Consequently, the flow of fresh air is distributed asymmetrically. 

Masking 

Masking refers to the design of the valve seats. This machining ensures that the incoming 
fresh air is aligned in such a way as to give rise to the required cylinder charge movement. 
The advantage of this measure is that the combustion retardation is reduced by approxi¬ 
mately 10° of crankshaft rotation. The combustion process takes place faster and a larger 
valve overlap can be achieved, thus considerably reducing NOx emissions.

Engine response is improved by the combination of Valvetronic III, direct injection and tur¬ 
bocharging. The response up to naturally aspirated full load is shortened on a naturally 
aspirated engine with Valvetronic as there is now no need wait for the intake air manifold 
to be filled. The subseguent torgue buildup as the turbocharger starts up can be acceler¬ 
ated with the partial lift setting at low engine speed. This effectively flushes out residual 
gas, thus resulting in faster torgue build-up.

Combustion Chamber Geometry 

The following graphic shows the arrangement of the individual components in the com¬ 
bustion chamber. It can be seen that the BMW (spray-guided) high precision injection 
(HPI) system is not used but rather a Bosch solenoid valve fuel injector with multi-hole 
nozzle. The fuel injection is specially adapted to the combination of Valvetronic III and tur¬ 
bocharging. For better illustration, a set of valves has been removed in the graphic.

Valve Lift Adjustment Overview 

As can be seen from the following graphic, the installation location of the servomotor has 
changed with Valvetronic III. Another new feature is that the eccentric shaft sensor is no 
longer mounted on the eccentric shaft but has been integrated into the servomotor.

Valvetronic Servomotor 

A brushless direct current motor (BLDC motor) is used. The BLCD motor is mainte¬ 
nance-free and very powerful, due to the contactless energy transfer system. The use of 
integrated electronic modules ensures precision control. 

The Valvetronic servomotor has the following special features: 

• Open concept (engine oil is directly supplied to the motor). 

• The eccentric shaft angle is determined by angle increments from the integrated 
sensor system. 

• Power consumption is reduced by about 50%. 

• Higher actuating dynamics (e.g. cylinder-selective adjustment, idle speed control, 
etc.). 

• Lightweight design is approximately 600 grams. 

Function 

Actuation of the Valvetronic servomotor is limited to a maximum of 40 amps. A maximum 
of 20 amps are available over a period of > 200 milliseconds. The Valvetronic servomotor 
is actuated by a pulse width modulated signal. The duty cycle is between 5% and 98%.

Air Intake and Exhaust System 


Air Intake System 

Several functions of the air intake system have been optimized for the N55 engine: 

• The unfiltered air is routed up to the intake silencer (similar to the N54 engine). 

• The filtered air duct is completely new and simplified to accommodate the new 
turbocharger. 

• The crankcase ventilation system has been redesigned. 

• The diverter valve has been integrated into the compressor housing 
of the turbocharger. 

• The fuel tank ventilation has been correspondingly adapted. 

The design layout of the air intake system has been simplified, compared to the dual 
turbocharger set up of the N54.

Exhaust Manifold 

The exhaust manifold is air-gap insulated and designed as a six ports into two chamber 
manifold. Dividing six exhaust ports into two exhaust chambers is necessary in order to 
ensure optimum flow to the twin scroll turbocharger. The exhaust pulses from the first 
three cylinders (1 -3) feed one scroll (duct 1) of the turbo, while the last three (4-6) feed 
the second scroll (duct 2). The exhaust manifold and turbocharger are welded together to 
form one component.

Function of the twin scroll turbocharger 

The system is designed so that constant exhaust gas pressure is rearly applied to the tur¬ 
bocharger. At low engine speeds, the exhaust reaches the turbine in tuned pulsed form. 
Due to this pulsation, a higher pressure ratio is temporarily reached in the turbine. Since 
the efficiency increases as the pressure rises, the pulsation improves the boost pressure 
progression and thus the torque progression of the engine. This is the case particularly at 
low engine speeds. 

To limit the back pressure and ensure that the individual cylinders do not mutually 
influence each other during the cylinder charging process, cylinders 1 - 3 (bank 1) and 
cylinders 4 - 6 (bank 2) are combined to form two exhaust channels. The exhaust gas 
pulses in the exhaust channels (1 and 2) are directed into two scrolls (spirals) within the 
turbocharger to drive the turbine wheel. This design layout makes it possible to optimally 
use the exhaust pulsations for generating boost pressure based on the firing order of the 
engine. This improves engine efficiency by enhancing throttle response and limiting 
unwanted turbo lag. 

The wastegate valve is used for the purpose of limiting the boost pressure and is already 
known from previous BMW turbo engines. It is vacuum operated and electronically con¬ 
trolled through a vacuum control solenoid by the DME (ECM). 

Diverter valve 

The basic function of the diverter valve remains the same. The difference compared to 
the N54 engine is that the diverter valve is not operated pneumatically. The diverter valve 
on the N55 engine is an electric actuator that is controlled directly by the DME. 

The number of components has been greatly reduced by positioning the diverter valve on 
the turbocharger compressor housing. 

The diverter valve is designed to release unwanted pressure in the intake by connecting 
the pressure side of the induction system to the inlet side under deceleration. The unde¬ 
sirable peaks in the boost pressure that can occur when the throttle valve is quickly 
closed are reduced. This means the diverter valve plays an important role in terms of the 
engine acoustics while protecting the components of the turbocharger.

Catalytic Converter 

Two ceramic honeycomb structures are contained in the catalytic converter housing. 
The catalytic converter has a volume of 2.7 liters. Depending on the type of vehicle the 
ceramic structures have different coatings. 

Ceramic structure 1 has a volume of 1.2 liters, a diameter of 125 mm, and 
contains 600 cells. 

Ceramic structure 2 has a volume of 1.5 liters, a diameter of 125 mm, and 
contains 400 cells.

Exhaust System 

With the single twin scroll turbocharger, the design of the exhaust system is less compli¬ 
cated than that of the N54 engine, with two turbochargers. In addition to a “near-engine” 
catalytic converter design, the exhaust system also features a center silencer 
and two rear silencers.

Vacuum System 

The N55 engine is equipped with a vacuum pump for generating the vacuum required by 
the brake booster and the auxiliary consumers (exhaust flaps and wastegate). A vacuum 
accumulator (built into the cylinder head cover) is used to ensure there is sufficient 
vacuum for the wastegate valve at all times.

Vacuum Pump 

The vacuum pump is similar to that used on the N63 engine. It is a two-stage pump and 
therefore has two connections. The first stage is for the brake booster and the second for 
the auxiliary consumers.

therefore takes longer to build up the vacuum here, as shown in the following diagram.

Fuel Injection 

The high pressure fuel injection system (HDE) is used on the N55 engine. In contrast to 
high precision injection (HPI), HDE uses solenoid fuel injectors with multi-hole nozzles. 

The following overview shows the complete fuel injection system. The system is similar 
to the N54 fuel injection. Although the same high pressure pump, pressure sensor, and 
fuel rail are used, the high pressure fuel injection valves are new. The HDE system uses 
Bosch high pressure solenoid type fuel injection valves with the designation HDEV5.2.

Fuel Pressure Sensor 

The fuel is supplied at a primary pressure of 5 bar by the electric fuel pump from the fuel 
tank via the supply line to the high pressure pump. The primary pressure is monitored by 
the fuel pressure sensor (5). The fuel is delivered by the electric fuel pump correspond¬ 
ing to engine requirements. The fuel pressure sensor known from the N54 and N63 is 
used. 

In the event of the fuel pressure sensor failing, the electric fuel pump continues operation 
at 100% delivery rate as from terminal 15 ON.

High Pressure Fuel Pump 

The fuel is pressurized in the permanently driven three-piston high pressure pump and 
delivered to the fuel rail via the high pressure line. The fuel stored under pressure in the 
fuel rail is distributed via the high pressure lines to the high pressure fuel injection valves. 
The required fuel pressure is determined by the engine management as a function of the 
engine load and engine speed. The pressure level is registered by the rail pressure 
sensor and sent to the engine control unit. The fuel is regulated by the quantity control 
valve based on a target/actual value comparison of the rail pressure. The pressure level is 
configured such to achieve the smoothest running properties with the best possible fuel 
consumption. A pressure of 200 bar is only required at high load and low engine speed. 
The high pressure pump is of the same design as the high pressure pump used on the 
N54 engine. 


N55, fuel pressure diagram 



73 

N55 Engine 








Fuel Injectors 

The high pressure fuel injection valve Bosch HDEV5.2 is a solenoid type injector. In con¬ 
trast to the piezo-electric injectors used on the current BMW engines, the solenoid valve 
fuel injectors are designed as inward-opening multi-hole valves with highly variable jet 
angle and form. They operate at a system pressure of up to 200 bar. 


Do not open the fuel system if the coolant temperature is 
above 40°C/104°F. The residual pressure in the high pres¬ 
sure fuel system could cause bodily injury. 



It is essential to observe the utmost cleanliness when working on the high pressure fuel 
system and to follow the proper working procedures described in the repair instructions. 
Even minute soiling or damage at the thread connections of the high pressure lines could 
cause leaks. 


Note: Special tool #13 0 270 must be used to remove the HDEV5.2 high pres¬ 
sure injector valves from the engine. Damage to the injector or the relat¬ 
ed components may occur otherwise. See the Service Information sec¬ 
tion in this training material for more information. 

Particular care must be taken when working on the fuel system of the N55 engine to 
ensure that the ignition coils are not wet with fuel. The resistance of the silicone insulating 
material of the coils is greatly reduced by the contact with fuel. This could result in arcking 
at the top of the spark plug and misfiring. See the Service Information section and repair 
instructions for more information.

Cooling System 

The cooling system of the N55 is enhanced with additional oil cooling. 

Two different types of oil cooling systems are used depending on the model and applica¬ 
tion. In the “hot climate” version, heat transfer from the engine oil to the engine coolant is 
avoided by separating the oil cooler from the engine coolant circuit. The other version 
uses an auxiliary radiator in combination with an oil to coolant heat exchanger bolted to 
the oil filter housing. The auxiliary radiator enhances cooling efficiency by adding surface 
area to the cooling system.

Coolant Passages 

The coolant passages in the cylinder head are also used for indirect cooling of the fuel 
injectors. The following graphic clearly shows that the coolant flows over the valves and

• The MEVD17.2 is FlexRay-compatible and directly supplies voltage to the sensors 
and actuators. 

The top side of the DME housing also serves as the bottom section of the intake 
manifold. The housing is contoured in the area of the intake manifold to ensure optimum

Functions 


Fuel supply system 

The fuel pressure sensor sends a voltage signal, corresponding to the system pressure 
applied between the fuel pump and the high pressure pump, to the engine control unit 
(DME/ECM). The system pressure (fuel pressure) is determined with the fuel 
pressure sensor upstream of the high pressure pump. The target pressure is constantly 
compared to the actual pressure in the DME. 

If the target pressure deviates from the actual pressure, the engine control unit increases 
or decreases the voltage for the electric fuel pump. This voltage is sent in the form of a 
message via the PT-CAN to the EKP control unit. 

The electric fuel pump (EKP) control unit converts the message into an output voltage 
for the electric fuel pump, thus regulating the required delivery pressure for the engine 
(or high pressure pump). The electric fuel pump is pilot-controlled in the event of signal 
failure (fuel pressure sensor). Should the CAN bus fail the EKP control unit operates the 
electric fuel pump with the applied system voltage. The fuel flows via the high pressure 
line to the fuel rail. The fuel is buffered in the fuel rail and distributed to the fuel injectors. 

Fuel quantity control 

The rail pressure sensor measures the current fuel pressure in the rail. The excess fuel is 
returned to the inlet of the high pressure pump when the quantity control valve in the 
high pressure pump opens. Vehicle operation is restricted in the event of the high pres¬ 
sure pump failing. 

The quantity control valve controls the fuel pressure in the rail. The engine management 
actuates the quantity control valve with a pulse width-modulated signal. Depending on 
the pulse width, a variable throttle cross section is released, thus providing the quantity of 
fuel required for the current load status of the engine. It is also possible to reduce the 
pressure in the rail. 

Boost pressure control 

The engine management controls the boost pressure with the wastegate valve at the 
turbocharger. An electropneumatic pressure converter (vacuum solenoid) receives the 
signals from the engine management and supplies vacuum to open the wastegate valve 
when the specified maximum boost pressure is reached. 


90 

N55 Engine 



A diverter valve is installed on the compressor housing of the turbocharger. It connects 
the pressure side to the inlet side of the induction system and is controlled directly by the 
engine management. The diverter valve eliminates undesirable peaks in the boost pres¬ 
sure that can occur when the throttle valve is guickly closed. Therefore it has a decisive 
influence on the engine acoustics while protecting the turbocharger and its related com¬ 
ponents. 

A pressure wave is built up from the throttle valve to the turbocharger compressor wheel 
when the throttle valve is closed. This pressure wave acts against the throttle plate and 
the compressor blades pressing them against the bearings. The diverter valve reduces 
this pressure wave and thus the load on these components by “diverting” air pressure 
from the pressure side to the suction side of the compressor housing. This also maintains 
the turbocharger spooled (up to speed) for the next acceleration and reduces turbo lag. 

Engine cooling 

The engine cooling system utilizes an electric coolant pump. The heat management 
determines the current cooling reguirement and controls the cooling system accordingly. 
Under certain circumstances, the coolant pump can be completely switched off, e.g. to 
rapidly heat up the coolant during the warm-up phase. The coolant pump continues to 
operate when the hot engine is shut down. The coolant capacity can therefore be varied 
regardless of the engine speed. In addition to the characteristic map thermostat, the heat 
management makes it possible to use various characteristic maps for controlling the 
coolant pump. In this way the engine control unit can adapt the engine temperature to 
the driving conditions. 

The engine control unit regulates the following temperature ranges: 

• 108°C/226°F = Economy mode 

• 104°C/219°F = Normal mode 

• 95°C/203°F - High mode 

• 90°C/194°F = High mode and control with characteristic map thermostat 

The engine management sets a higher temperature (108°C) when, based on vehicle 
operation, the engine control unit detects ’’Economy” mode. The engine is operated with 
relatively low fuel reguirements in this temperature range. The internal engine friction is 
reduced at higher temperatures. The increase in temperature therefore results in low fuel 
consumption in the low load range. The driver wishes to utilize the optimum power devel¬ 
oped by the engine in “High and control with characteristic map thermostat” mode. For 
this purpose, the temperature in the cylinder head is reduced to 90°C. This temperature 
reduction promotes improved volumetric efficiency, thus resulting in an increased engine 
torgue. Adapted to the relevant driving situation, the engine control unit can now regulate 
a defined operating range. In this way it is possible to influence the fuel consumption and 
power output through the cooling system. 


91 

N55 Engine 



System Protection 

If the coolant or the engine oil overheat during operation, certain vehicle functions are 
influenced to the effect that more energy is available to the engine cooling system. 

These measures are divided over two operating modes: 

• Component protection 

- Coolant temperature between 117°C/242°F and 124°C/255°F 

- Engine oil temperature between 150°C/300°F and 157°C/314°F 

- Result: The output of the air conditioning system 
(up to 100%) and of the engine is reduced 

• Emergency 

- Coolant temperature between 125°C/257°F and 129°C/264°F 

- Engine oil temperature between 158°C/316°F and 163°C/325°F 

- Result: The power output of the engine is reduced 
(up to 90%) 


Crankshaft Sensor 

The function of the new crankshaft sensor is identical to that of the crankshaft sensors 
used for the automatic engine start-stop function (MSA). The engine reversal detection is 
required for the MSA function. (MSA is not currently offered in the US.)

Ignition Coil 

New ignition coils have been developed for the N55 engine. The ignition coils have 
improved electromagnetic compatibility and are sturdier. The insulation has been rein¬ 
forced with silicone and a metal collar shielding compared to the coils used on previous 
engines. See the Service Information section of this training material for more details. 


CAUTION!!! 


Always remove the ignition coils before opening the fuel system. Gasoline may 
damage the silicone insulation on the coils which may lead to arcking and sub¬ 
sequent engine misfiring.

Oil Pressure Sensor 

The new oil pressure sensor can now determine 
the absolute pressure. 

The sensor delivers a more accurate pressure 
reading which is required for the electronic volume 
control oil pump function. 

The sensor design is identical to that of the (high) 

fuel pressure sensor. The DME supplies a voltage 

of 5 Volt to the oil pressure sensor. lirr

Oxygen sensor before catalytic converter 

The Bosch oxygen sensor LSU ADV is used as the control sensor before the catalytic 
converter. The abbreviation LSU stands for “Lambdasonde Universal” and ADV for 
“Advanced”. The function is similar to that of the LSU 4.9 oxygen sensor and is therefore 
described in detail in the E71 X6 training material under “N63 engine” available in TIS 
and ICR 

The oxygen sensor before catalytic converter (LSU ADV) offers the following advantages: 

• High signal stability specially during turbocharged operation due to low dynamic 
pressure dependence. 

• Increased durability due to reduced pump voltage. 

• Increased accuracy (by a factor of 1.7 compared to LSU 4.9). 

• Ready for operation in < 5 seconds. 

• Greater temperature compatibility. 

• Improved connector with more effective contacting properties. 

The LSU ADV has an extended measuring range, making it possible to measure 
precisely from lambda 0.65. The new oxygen sensor is ready for operation faster so that 
exact measured values are available within 5 seconds of start up. 

The higher measuring dynamics of the sensor makes it possible to more effectively 
determine and control the fuel-air ratio separately for each cylinder. This results in a 
homogeneous exhaust flow that reduces emissions while also having a favorable effect 
on long-term emission characteristics. 


Oxygen sensor after catalytic converter 

The oxygen sensor after catalytic converter is also known as the monitoring sensor. 
The familiar Bosch LSF 4.2 monitoring sensor is used.

Hot-film air mass meter 

The Siemens SIMAF GT2 hot-film air mass meter is used. This sensor is equipped with 
planar metal resistors on glass. Based on the tried and tested sensor technology used in 
the SIMAF GT1 for more than 15 years, the SIMAF GT2 represents a further-develop¬ 
ment and optimization with higher vibration resistance, improved accuracy (at all operating 
temperatures), and lower sensitivity to air pulsations and water.

High Pressure Fuel Injector Valve 

The FIDEV5.2 solenoid type injector valves used on the N55 engine are a new 
development. 

1 Booster phase: 

Opening of the FIDEV5.2 is initiated in the booster phase by a high booster voltage 
from the DME. The booster phase ends on reaching approximately 10 amps. 

The high current is achieved by a voltage of up to approximately 65 Volt. 

2 Energizing phase: 

In the energizing phase, the FIDEV5.2 is completely opened by controlling the 
current to approximately 6.2 amps. At the end of the energizing phase, the current is 
reduced to the holding current level of approximately 2.5 amps. 

3 Hold phase: 

The energized HDEV5.2 is kept open by controlling the current at approximately 
2.5 amps in the hold phase. 

4 Switch off phase: 

The current is switched off at the end of the injection time (in the switch off phase). 
At least 2 milliseconds elapse between two injection cycles.

Service Information 


Cylinder Head 

The combination of exhaust turbocharger, Valvetronic, and direct fuel injection is referred 
to as Turbo-Valvetronic-Direct-Injection (TVDI). 

Cylinder Head Cover 

Note: If a customer complains about high oil consumption and oil is 
discovered in the turbocharger, it should not be immediately 
assumed that the turbocharger is defective. 

If the oil is present in the fresh air pipe after the introduction of the 
blow-by gasses then the entire engine should be checked for leaks. 
Defective gaskets or crankshaft seals may be the cause of excessively 
high blow-by gas output. 


Fuel Injectors 

In order to remove the N55 fuel injectors from the cylinder head, special tool #13 0 270 
must be utilized. Failure to use the special tool will result in damage to the injectors. 



Note: Do not open the high pressure fuel injection system if the coolant 

temperature is above 40°C. The residual pressure in the high pressure 
fuel system could cause bodily injury. 


99 

N55 Engine 




Note: It is essential to follow the repair instructions and observe the utmost 

cleanliness when working on the high pressure fuel system. Even minute 
soiling or damage at the connections of the high pressure lines and 
cause leaks. 

There is a new tool # 13 0 280 that must be used when replacing the PTFE seals on the 
tips of the solenoid valve injectors. As with piezoelectric injectors these seals must be 
replaced if and when the injectors are being re-installed. 




Ignition Coils 

The ignition coils of the N55 have been redesigned for better rigidity and durability. 
Particular care must be taken when working on the fuel system to ensure that the ignition 
coils are not wet with fuel. The resistance of the silicone material is greatly reduced by 
contact with fuel. This could compromise the coils insulation and result in arcking at the 
top of the spark plug causing a misfire. 

• The ignition coils must be removed before working on the fuel system. 

• When installing new solenoid valve fuel injectors utmost cleanliness must be 
observed. 

• After removing the ignition coils use a rag to prevent fuel from entering the spark 
plug well. 

• Ignition coils that have been saturated with fuel must be replaced.
