The New 7-Series 


Introducing the F01/F02 

In autumn 2008, the F01 will be in production in the Dingolfing plant. At the same time, 
the F02 (long-wheelbase version) will start coming off the assembly line. 

The range will be represented by the 740i, 740iL and 750i and 750Li models. The 
F01/F02 is lower in height than the E65/ E66 and it has an improved rear passenger 
compartment (space for head/knees). The wheelbase too is considerably longer. 
Fleadroom and luggage-compartment capacity are more or less the same as in the E65.

Dimensional Comparison, F02 vs F01 

The following text describes the dimensional differences between the F01 and the longer 
wheelbase version, the F02: 

• Wheelbase longer by 140 mm 

• F02 rear axle with pneumatic springs and self-levelling suspension as standard 

• F02 has more rear-passenger orientation and a multifunction seat with improved 
comfort. 

The F01/F02 is characterized by highly efficient petrol and diesel engines (more power in 
combination with lower fuel consumption). 

The suspension damping is variable, with 3stage adjustment. The steering is an Integral 
Active Steering configuration with steerable rear axle. 

Drive assistance systems and a cockpit arrangement with driver orientation and a selector 
lever set in the center console are distinct from the E65.

Body Overview 


Bodyshell (body-in-white) 

As with other models, the use of lightweight materials was a major requirement in the 
F01/ F02 design brief. This was achieved by the intelligent use of high-strength multi¬ 
phase steels and very-high-strength hot-formed steels (strength of the body structure 
has again been increased over that of the predecessor model). 

The lightweight materials contribute significantly to the overall reduction in gross vehicle 
weight and in combination with the rigidity of the bodywork skeleton they also contribute 
significantly to the car’s drive dynamics. 

Highlights: 

• Cast-aluminum spring mounts and aluminum roof 
(4 % of the body skeleton weight) 

• High proportion of multiphase steels (18 % of the body skeleton weight) 

• High proportion of hot-formed steels (16 % of the body skeleton weight) 

Function 

The cast-aluminum spring mounts strengthen the front section and improve drive 
dynamics. Lightweight construction with aluminum in the front section contributes to 
uniform axle load distribution. 

The aluminum roof lowers the center of gravity of the vehicle as a whole, thus contribut¬ 
ing positively to drive dynamics. 

The increased-strength multiphase steels and very-high-strength hot-formed steels 
combine low weight with maximum strength for the safety passenger cell, thus con¬ 
tributing very significantly to passive safety. 

Interested readers will find a wealth of background information on nomenclature and 
abbreviations in the Product Information entitled “Basics of High-Strength Steels”.

F01 Introduction 
















In order to optimize anti-corrosion protection, the bodywork of the F01/F02 is construct¬ 
ed primarily from fully galvanized sheet, special-steel sheet and aluminum sheet. 

Welding, adhesive bonding and riveting are the connection technigues used. 

Where sheets are doubled up the design is such as to minimize the contact surfaces. 

This helps prevent bondline corrosion. 

All other anti-corrosion protection and sealing measures depend on the extent to which 
the doubled sheets are exposed to moisture/ water. 

In particularly critical areas, expanding foam parts are used to seal the body cavities 
against the ingress of water. All doubled sheets in wet zones are double-sealed and, if 
necessary, they are also treated with wax as an extra sealant. 

Doubled sheets in dry zones (above the waistline) are sealed not against corrosion as 
such, but if necessary to avoid the ingress of dust. 

Corrosion-critical material pairing is avoided. The combinations of material substrates and 
joining technigue were chosen with meticulous care in order to avoid corrosion risks. 

Coating process 

In the painting process the bodyshell is dipped and: 

• Alkaline-cleaned 

• Phosphated (roughening of the surface so the coating forms a good key) and 

• Cathodic-dip coated (anticorrosion coating that coats the insides of all body cavities). 
The organic paint coat is then baked on. 

In follow-up processes the body is sealed with PVC and protected by filler and topcoat 
paints on the outer skin. 

Critical parts of the body of the F01/F02 are specially treated with cavity sealant. 

The objectives are: 

• 3 years without any visible corrosion whatsoever 

• 12 years without rust penetration 

• High level of seal efficiency against increase of water and dust. 

The design implements the following measures aimed at controlling acoustic effects and 
vibrations in the F01/F02 bodyshell: 

• Narrow engine-mount base to reduce structure-borne sound transmission to the 
front of the car 

• Longer rear-axle mount base; solution of the trade-off between liveliness of response 
on the one hand and acoustics on the other 


11 

F01 Introduction 



• Rolling acoustics with runflat tires on a par with those of non-runflats 

• Optimized vehicle insulation, even though the roof is aluminum 

• Double bulkhead panel with need-oriented acoustic insulation 

• High static and dynamic body stiffnesses; homogeneous flex line 

• Outstanding idling comfort 

• Acoustically insulating glass available as an optional extra 

• V8 and larger engines: hydraulically damped gearbox mounts: 
solution of trade-off between shake vs. acoustics. 



The aluminum roof is one of the engineering highlights of the F01/F02 bodyshell. 

• Aluminum roof on steel body in series production 

• Weight saving (8.4 kg for the slide/tilt sunroof version) 

• Lowers the car’s center of gravity > drive dynamics, C02 

• Adhesive-bonded aluminum roof; this also means optimum anti-corrosion protection 
in mixed-material construct 

• Top part of frame riveted (slide/tilt sunroof version) 

• Patented shaping to compensate for thermal expansion and contraction 

• Use of a newly developed adhesive generation (“expansion/contraction vs. strength”, 
shear modulus over temperature, long-term strength) 

• Spacer nubs integrated into roof ensure correct gap for the adhesive 

• Assurance of a roof-rack concept (100 kg load-bearing capacity). 

12 

F01 Introduction 




The aluminum roof can be separated from the bodyshell by heating the adhesive and 
inserting wooden wedges to open a gap between the aluminum roof and the bodyshell.

F01 Introduction 



Front End 

The F01/F02 share the same front end of the bodyshell. 



The engine supports are shorter than those 
of the E65. Consequently, there is no repair 
section for the engine bearers for the F01/ 
F02. 


The wheel housing is similar in design to that 
of the E70 (cast-aluminum spring mount). In 
most instances in which the wheel housing 
requires repair, engine and gearbox can 
remain installed in the car. 

There are repair sections for the top support. 

The front side panel is a bolt-on aluminum 
panel. There are spacers between the side 
panel and the bodyshell.

Side Frame 



As in the predecessor model, the B pillar of the side frame is made of very-high-strength 
steel. A new feature is that the sill is made of the same material as the B pillar. 

Repair sections, side frame F01/F02 

The following sections have been defined for parts-replacement repairs of the side frame:

Rear, F01/F02 

The rear of the F01/F02 is a conventional structure. With regard to repair procedures, 
there are no major innovations as compared to the E65/E66.

F01 Introduction 


Front end 


The front end of the F01/F02 can be completely separated from the rest of the car. 

It consists of the front bumper, the lights and numerous sensors and the diverse cover 
panels. 




The front end is attached by means of the engine carrier and the front axle. This is new. 
Removing the front end entails releasing the threaded fasteners at the engine carrier. 


17 

F01 Introduction 




The threaded fasteners of the front-axle mounts also have to be undone. 

The threaded fasteners of the radiator bracket also have to be undone (do not open the 
cooling circuit). The final steps are to release the support of the lock and remove the 
wheel-arch panels. 

The advantage of having the front end attached by means of the engine carrier and the 
front axle is that in the event of a collision, there is a second load path to dissipate the col¬ 
lision forces. 



This makes for better results in the statutory crash tests and advantages in terms of 
pedestrian protection and the high-speed crash reguirements. 

Another interesting point is the material mix in the threaded-fastener concept of this 
mounting system. The engine carrier is made of increased-strength steel, while the 
bumper mounts and the front-axle anchorages are aluminum.

F01 Introduction 


















Doors 


The F01/F02 has aluminum doors with sheet-metal shell window frames. The advan¬ 
tages of this configuration are as follows: 

• Improved visibility to the outside and upward 

• Window frames look lighter and slimmer when the doors are closed 

• When the doors are open, the window frames look solid with a high-quality appeal 

• More light can make its way into the passenger compartment 

• Interior impression with improved feeling of space. 


Front door 



The doors are made of large, sheet-metal shells to transmit force. The corpus of the door 
is characterized by high rigidity and component quality, ensured by the closest possible 
tolerances. Numerous advantages derive from this make-up: 

• Compliance with the highest requirements for rigidity at the window frames, because 
the frame is a single section made of only two sheet-metal parts with minimum 
dimensions and good manufacturability 

• Implementation of the premium design/form language in the exterior by realization of 
extreme deep-draw dimensions and a new component separation (hinge reinforce¬ 
ment and door inside panel) 

• Maximum geometrical stability of the individual parts with one-piece door inside 
panel (window frame and door corpus) 

• Lowest possible number of components for the door structure 

• Laser welding and structural adhesive bonding as the joining technologies of the 
door structure. 


19 

F01 Introduction 


Rear door 



BMW has often used aluminum door structures in the past, for example for the Z8. Until 
now, however, aluminum doors were manufactured only for models produced in relatively 
small numbers of units. 

The development objective for the F01/F02 door structure, therefore, was to implement a 
concept for an aluminum door that can be manufactured in larger numbers at acceptable 
costs. 

Flowever, aluminum is not as easy to shape as steel, so aluminum sheet shell parts are 
much more difficult to manufacture than counterpart steel components, particularly when 
the deep-drawing depths are considerable. 

Despite these difficulties, the development of a new structure concept with large shells to 
transmit force sufficed to improve the manufacturability of the components, without 
necessitating a departure from the proven sheet-metal shell structure. A new cross-sec¬ 
tion at the window frame achieves high rigidity and good manufacturability; there are only 
2 parts and dimensions are minimized. In this way, the intensive form language typical of 
BMW’s exterior lines is carried over into the material aluminum, bringing dimensional min¬ 
imization to the visually sensitive area of the window frames and utilizing high deep-draw 
depths to preclude the possibility of taking up more space. 

As regards the interior parts of the doors, it is noticeable that unlike the E65, there are no 
airbags in the door trim. Again at variance with the E65, the outside mirrors can be 
removed without the necessity of removing the door trim. 

The sound-deadening mats and the fasteners for the wiring harness in the door are also 
of new design. The installation and removal of the exterior door handle are slightly more 
difficult than is the case with the E65. 

Window lifts and locks are similar to those of the E65. A new roller sunblind is a feature of 
the rear door. The mounting elements are of modified design.

Interior Equipment 

The interior of the F01/F02 has evolved again beyond that of the E65/E66. There is more 
knee-room for the rear-seat passengers. The same also applies to headroom in the rear. 
By the same token, the steering column adjusts over a longer range than in the predeces¬ 
sor model. 



Interior equipment, F01/F02 


The following are available for stowage inside the passenger compartment: 

• Oddments tray with hinged lid on the left beside the steering column 

• Folding-lid compartment in center console with mobile-phone adapter 

• Large glove box 

• DVD changer in directly accessible compartment with lid 

• Large pockets in the doors. 


21 

F01 Introduction 



The driver assistance systems available are: 

• Head-up display 

• Night Vision II 

• ACC 

• Lane-departure Warning and Active Blind Spot Detection 

An improved multimedia interface offers even more convenience and additional freely 
programmable buttons. 

The F01/F02 offers perceptible driver orientation, for example gear-selector switch, actu¬ 
ating switch for the electromechanical parking brake and drive-dynamics switch in the 
center console. 

The passenger compartment also features multimedia functions such as USB, hard-disc 
drive and multimedia changer (including DVD). A slimmer instrument panel without 
emphatic double dome over the instruments expresses the higher tone. Similarly, there is 
no slot for the ignition key (I.D. transmitter) Passive Go is now standard. 


22 

F01 Introduction 



Seats 

The front seating on the F01 consists of the multifunction seats. This seat features a 
side airbag integrated into the seat backrest. 

If the Rear Seat Entertainment option is installed the backrest head of each front seat has 
a rear-facing monitor set in the rear. Ambience lights for the rear compartment are also 
set in the back panel of each front seat. 

The seat-adjustment switches have been relocated and are now back on the seats 
themselves, whereas the seat function switches are again set in the door trim. 

The front seat features crash-active headrests. There is also a choice between basic and 
high versions for the rear seats.

F01 Introduction 









The “Comfort seat, rear” is available as part of the “Luxury Rear Seating” package only in 
the F02. The comfort seat is a two-seat configuration for more passenger comfort. 
Between the seats there is a small console with a storage compartment and lid. 

The center armrest has a recess cover. The cover moves into position to cover the recess 
when the armrest is extended. There is also a cupholder integrated into the center armrest.

rear seat ventilation system which directs air to different parts of the seat. This is accom¬ 
plished by air mats perforated at defined points to direct the air to the seat occupant’s 
body. 

The cooled air is drawn in from the passenger compartment at the bottom of the B pillar. 
This new concept has a significantly better cooling effect than the configuration in the 
E65, especially in hot climates. 

The diverse individual fans in the acclimatized seat of the E65 are replaced by two central 
fans per seat. These fans draw in air cooled air from the passenger compartment through 
the shared box.

The fans blow air toward the seat occupants. Fan speed varies as a function of the seat’s 
surface temperature. 

The rear massage seat is a new optional extra. 12 inflatable massage pads relax the 
musculature of the seat occupant’s back with a wavelike downward massaging action. 
The rotary mobilization function is produced by 6 pads. These pads are set in the outer- 
shoulder area and in the middle of the thorax and in the lower lumbar region. 

To achieve segment rotation, the left shoulder pad is inflated with the right lumbar pad 
and the left thorax pad. This changes periodically with the opposite set of pads. 

A complete massage cycle takes 64 seconds, then the process starts again at the begin¬ 
ning.

The impression of space in the rear of the F02 is improved considerably by comparison 
with the E66, on account of the multifunction seat and the rear air-conditioning system. 


By the same token, the ambience enjoyed by the rear-seat passengers reflects the most 
exacting standards. This starts with the vanity mirror in the headliner, continues through 
the controls for the rear-seat air-conditioning system through to the 9” screens and DVD 
drives that are standard with the Rear Seat Entertainment optional extra. 

These screens are set in the backrests of the front seats. 

The Controller and numerous other secondary controls are set in the rear center armrest. 
In conjunction with the ambience lights package, these features combine to give a higher 
feeling of sumptuous luxury even than the E65. 


28 

F01 Introduction 












Belt System 

The F01/F02 has electric belt reels (EMA) for the driver’s and front passenger’s seat 
belts. In this arrangement the B pillar accommodates an electric motor with control unit. 
This is an automatic belt reel with a motor/gear unit.

• Pre-crash function In a hazard situation the occupant is brought to the crash position 
at which the restraint systems can operate at maximum efficiency. This function is 
reversible.

F01 Introduction 













Luggage Compartment 

At 500 liters, luggage-compartment capacity is the same as that of the E65. 

The following luggage-compartment versions are available: 

• Luggage compartment with rear-compartment air conditioning and cool box 

• Luggage compartment with cool box 

• Luggage compartment with rear-compartment air conditioning 

• Luggage compartment without rear-compartment air conditioning/and without cool 
box. In this configuration the capacity of the luggage compartment has a capacity of 
500 liters. 

It will accommodate 1 medium-sized and 2 small cases and a cosmetic case. 
Alternatively, 4 golf bags or 2 pairs of skis or 1 snowboard can be transported. 

The are compartments with storage trays underneath and a height-adjustable net offer 
practical possibilities for stowage. The toolkit and warning triangle are now again stowed 
in the luggage compartment lid.

F01 Introduction 















Rear Bumper 

The bumper panel of the rear bumper is a no-gap fit to the side frame. The reflectors are 
integrated into the bumper panel. The bottom part of the panel is also finished in the 
body color. Chrome-plated stainless steel end-silencer covers are integrated into the 
bottom part of the bumper panel. 

Model differentiation is carried though by various details for the 8-cylinder and the future 
12-cylinder power plants. An extra chrome finisher for the 12-cylinder emphasizes the 
top-of-the-line engine. 



The bumper panel’s overhang past the luggage compartment lid is minimal in combina¬ 
tion with the finisher panel for the luggage compartment lid. There is a seamless transi¬ 
tion between rear-light unit and bumper panel. 

The bumper carrier (with the shock absorber) is bolted to the bodyshell structure. It can 
absorb low-speed impacts without damage to the bodywork (at least 2.5 mph). 

The bumper system is a consumer-protection-complaint design that prevents damage to 
the car’s body structure. Deformation elements specifically designed for the purpose 
make for low repair costs. 


33 

F01 Introduction 
















Slide/tilt Sunroof 


The F01/F02 has an evolved sliding sunroof system, known as the contour roof. 

The contour roof has a larger area of glass than a conventional sliding sunroof system, so 
it contributes positively to the interior effect and to the feeling of space inside the car. 

The headliner panel is electrically operated, and since this means that there is no grip in 
the panel the impression of interior space is even further enhanced, because the sliding 
headliner panel now integrates into the interior design of the headliner as a homoge¬ 
neous surface, underscoring the premium luxury effect. 

When we turn our attention to the exterior we see that the design integration of the glass 
into the car’s skin is effected by the contour curvature of the glass sunroof. At its leading 
edge, it is oriented in parallel with the leading edge of the roof at the transition to the 
windscreen, contributing to the harmonic appearance of the car as a whole. 

In order to maintain a pleasant level of background noise with the glass sunroof fully open, 
the contour roof features a speed-dependent combination slipstream deflector.

Explanation

Contour roof

Standard, slide/tilt sunroof 


The contour roof features an inside-mount slide/tilt sunroof. Glass panel, sliding headliner 
panel and combination slipstream deflector are all-electric and are operated by a switch 
set in the roof-functions overhead console (FZD), in line with BMW’s usual control and 
operation logic for the sliding sunroof: 

• To open the roof -> Push the switch to the rear 

• To close the roof -> Push the switch forward 

• Set roof to vent position -> Push the switch up. 


34 

F01 Introduction 










The operation and control logic for opening the sliding headliner panel is analogous to 
that familiar from the BMW panorama-roof configurations. The direction in which the con¬ 
trol is moved corresponds to the direction in which the component is to be moved, so 
this logic is easy for customers to grasp. 

To exclude the risk of possible injury, the entire range of movement of the glass roof panel 
and the sliding headliner panel has a trap release function with a special electronic con¬ 
troller in accordance with international legal requirements. 

When the glass sunroof panel and the sliding sunroof panel are both fully closed, the 
material of which the sliding sunroof panel is made keeps the background noise level on 
a par with that of a car with normal roof. 

The combination slipstream deflector can move to either of 2 possible positions, depend¬
