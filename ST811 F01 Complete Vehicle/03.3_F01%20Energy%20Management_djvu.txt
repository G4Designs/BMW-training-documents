Introduction 


The Energy Circuit in the Vehicle 

The vehicle’s electrical energy system comprises all components for generating, storing, 
distributing and converting electrical energy. 

The job of the vehicle’s electrical energy system is to supply and distribute electrical 
energy in all vehicle operating situations. The aim is to provide all electrical components 
with the necessary electrical energy in all vehicle situations. 

The highest-priority aims are maintaining the vehicle’s ability to start and trouble-free 
operation of the vehicle when it is being driven. Another aim is to minimize wear (high 
battery energy throughput) and prevent damage to components (total battery discharge) 
of the vehicle’s electrical system by networking, dimensioning and appropriate control of 
devices that consume, store and convert electrical energy. 

Like the other current BMW Group models, the F01/F02 uses an energy management 
system to ensure balanced use of energy on the vehicle. 

The energy management functions are integrated in the power management system 
that is implemented in the form of software on the engine management module.

Bus Overview and Terminal Status 

The F01/F02 introduces new designations for some of the terminals. A distinction is also 
made between logical terminals and power supply terminals. The logical terminals are: 

• Terminal R 

• Terminal 15 

• Terminal 50. 

The power supply terminals are: 

• Terminal 30 

• Terminal 15N 

• Terminal 30B 

• Terminal 30F. 


The logical terminals do not serve as power supply terminals; instead, they represent 
a status. They are activated/deactivated by pressing the START-STOP button. 

The table below details the previous and new terminal designations.

Power Management 


The power management system is a subsystem of the energy management system. 

The power management functions are carried out by the engine management module 
(DME). 

The power management system regulates the power consumption of some of the most 
important electrical devices and the power output of the alternator while the vehicle is 
being driven. 

Only advanced power management (APM) is used on the F01/F02. 

In addition to the main functions of basic power management (idling speed and required 
battery charge voltage), APM also incorporates the following extended functions: 

• Electric load reduction 

• Electric load shut-down 

• Vehicle systems diagnosis 

• Battery diagnosis. 

Idle Speed Boost 

On vehicles with gasoline engines, the idling speed is raised by up to 200 rpm as soon 
as current starts to be drawn from the battery despite the alternator working at full 
capacity. 

Charging Voltage Target Value 

The required battery charge voltage is determined according to outside temperature and 
IGR function.

F01 Energy Management 
















Effect of Outside Temperature 

The required battery charge voltage function ensures electrochemically optimum battery 
charging by adjusting the battery charge voltage according to temperature. Since the 
current absorbed by a cold battery is lower, the voltage for charging must be higher than 
for a warm battery. 

Conversely, if that higher voltage were constantly used to charge a warm battery, there 
would be a risk of gas formation. Therefore, the charge voltage is regulated on the alter¬ 
nator according to temperature. The current battery temperature is measured by the 
intelligent battery sensor (IBS) attached directly to the battery negative terminal and sig¬ 
nalled to the engine management module (DME) via the LIN bus. 

The power management uses this value as the input variable for calculating the battery 
temperature. With the aid of a calculation model, the specified charging voltage is set 
based on the battery temperature. This information is sent to the alternator via the bit- 
temperature of serial data interface (BSD). 


11 

F01 Energy Management 



Battery Regeneration 

In order to ensure the availability of IGR Low, a certain level of unused capacity must 
always be retained in the battery. That is implemented by means of IGR High and IGR 
Medium. For the battery, that means that it is never fully charged. If a battery were not 
fully charged over a long period or were left fully discharged, sulphation could occur. 
Sulphation causes a battery to prematurely age, thereby reducing the usable proportion 
of its rated capacity. To prevent that occurring, the reguired battery charge voltage func¬ 
tion performs a battery regeneration cycle in the course of which the battery is fully 
charged. 

On vehicles with IGR function, regular battery regeneration phases are maintained in 
order to protect the battery against premature aging and loss of capacity due to cyclic 
discharge and sulphation. That involves the battery being fully charged using the maxi¬ 
mum permissible charge voltage taking account of ambient conditions (temperature, 
charge level). 

Emergency Operation 

The APM makes use of emergency operation set to a constant 14.3 V. A fault code func¬ 
tions when there is a break in the LIN “Communication LIN” is entered in the fault inter¬ 
face. In this case, the alternator voltage is code memory of the engine management.

Electric Load Reduction 

In order to reduce the power consumption in critical situations, not only can the idling 
speed be increased and the required charge voltage raised, the power of various non- 
essential electrical devices can be reduced or they can be switched off altogether. 

That prevents the battery being discharged. 

The electrical devices (that consume power when the engine is running) are subdivided 
into two classes. 

• Class A 

A reduction of the power consumption or shut-down of these devices is only notice¬ 
able to the driver to a limited degree or after a delay. Individual Class A devices are 
only switched off or have their power consumption reduced under the following 2 
conditions: 

- Battery charge status in critical range 

- High load on alternator. 

• Class B 

A reduction of the power consumption or shut-down of these functions is immedi¬ 
ately noticeable to the driver. Individual Class B devices are only switched off or have 
their power consumption reduced under the following condition: 

- Battery charge status in critical range.

The following measures are taken for Class A devices under the conditions specified

fault memory entry is registered and the history memory records the 
duration, odometer reading, and the function concerned.

Advanced Power Management 

Vehicle in Stationary Mode 
Electric loads in stationary mode 

Certain electric loads may be active even when the closed-circuit current monitoring facil¬ 
ity of the power management is already in operation. This is necessary for various rea¬ 
sons: 

• Legally reguired electric loads, e.g. side lights, hazard warning system 

• Convenience for the customer, e.g. radio function, telephone. 

These electric loads must be excluded from the closed-circuit current monitoring system 
in order to avoid misinterpretation in the power management. For this purpose, these 
electric loads must log in with the power management. 

In turn, the power management recognizes the activity and accepts the higher power 
consumption when the systems are deactivated, the corresponding control units log off 
from the power management. 

Stationary load log-off 

The power management in the engine control can send a reguest to switch off the active 
electric loads in stationary mode depending on the battery charge status and the start 
capability limit. The electrical devices operating when the vehicle is in stationary mode 
must then deactivate their functions irrespective of the terminal status and must have 
attained their closed-circuit current within 5 minutes. Legally reguired electric loads are 
excluded from this function.

Terminals 

New Terminal Designation 

The F01/F02 introduces new designations for some of the terminals. A distinction is also 
made between logical terminals and power supply terminals. The logical terminals are: 

• Terminal R 

• Terminal 15 

• Terminal 50. 

The logical terminals do not serve as power supply terminals; instead, they represent a 
status. They are activated/deactivated by pressing the START-STOP button. Their status 
is signalled to the control units by means of a bus message. 

The power supply terminals are: 

• Terminal 30 

• Terminal 15N 

• Terminal 30B 


• Terminal 30F. 

The table below details the previous and new terminal designations.

Terminal 15N 

Terminal 15N is used to supply power to control units and components that are only 
intended to be active when the vehicle is being driven, e.g. PDC. 

The letter “N” stands for “Nachlauf”, meaning “overrun”. The power supply Terminal 15N 
is switched on and off by means of the logical Terminal 15. The overrun time after 
Terminal 15N is switched off is 5 seconds. That time is required so that the control units 
have enough time to save their data. While Terminal 15N is active, Terminal 30B and 
Terminal 30F are also active. 

Terminal 30B 

Terminal 30B supplies power to control units and electrical components 
that are required when the driver is present. 

The letter B stands for “Basic mode”. 

Terminal 30B is activated by: 

• Pressing the buttons on the radio remote control 

• Unlocking/locking/double-locking the vehicle 

• Pressing the START-STOP button 

• Change of door switch status, change of trunk switch status, 
change of side-window position 

• Bus message. 

Regular deactivation by: 

• Vehicle double-locked and tailgate closed (one minute overrun) 

• Vehicle not double-locked or tailgate open (30 minutes overrun). 

Other possible deactivation triggers: 

• Upper starting capacity limit reached (one minute overrun) 

• “Powerdown”: diagnosis command for purposes of measuring 
closed-circuit (10 seconds overrun) 

• Transport mode (one minute overrun). 

While Terminal 30B is active, Terminal 30F is also active. 


18 

F01 Energy Management 



Terminal 30F 


Terminal 30F supplies power to control units and electrical devices that are also required 
when the driver is not present but which can be switched off in the event of a fault. 

Use: all control units that are not supplied by Terminal 15N or Terminal 30B, are not 
responsible for vehicle access and do not have to meet a legal requirement for permanent 
operation. 

The letter “F” stands for “Fault”. 

Terminal 30F is activated by: 

• Pressing the buttons on the radio remote control 

• Unlocking/locking/double-locking the vehicle 

• Pressing the START-STOP button 

• Change of door switch status, change of tailgate switch status, 
change of side-window position 

• Bus message. 

In the event of a fault (closed-circuit current too high, bus wake-up, sleep-mode inhibitor, 
start capacity limit reached) Terminal 30F is reset for 10 seconds. 

Terminal 30F is not reset or switched off if at least one of the following conditions is met: 

• Terminal 30B active 

• Parking lights switched on 

• Side lights switched on 

• Flazard warning lights switched on 

• If an extended overrun time for Terminals 30B and 30F is demanded by a service 
message from any of a number of control units. Example: when the engine is warm, 
it can be necessary for the electric fan to run on for up to 11 minutes after the vehi¬ 
cle is parked and locked. In order for the electric fan to be operated, the engine man¬ 
agement module must be supplied with power. Since the overrun time in that case 
is only three minutes (that is currently the short overrun time for Terminal 30B, not 
one minute), the DME requests the appropriate extension byway of a bus message 
when the engine is switched off. 

• “Sticking relay” detected. 

Terminal 30F is switched off if Terminal 30B is off and at least one of the following 
conditions is met: 

• Starting capacity limit reached 

• Another 10 bus wake-ups have occurred afterTerminal 30F reset 

• Unexplained bus activity afterTerminal 30F reset 

• Violation of closed-circuit current limit detected afterTerminal 30F reset.

The Junction box module controls the bistable relays for Terminal 30F but receives the 
request from the central gateway module (ZGM) or IBS. 

• ZGM: If sleep mode inhibited or on occurrence of unauthorized wake-up. 

ZGM monitors the vehicle status and registers inhibited sleep mode or unauthorized 
wake-up after Terminal 30B is switched off. 

• IBS: If closed-circuit current limit violated or starting capacity limit reached. 

The computation for activating the Terminal 30F relay takes place on two control units. 
The ZGM monitors the following activities: 

• Invalid wake-up procedures within the bus systems 

• Sleep blockers (control units that constantly keep the bus systems active). 

The ECM (DME) continuously reads and assesses the battery data. The relay is also 
switched off when the starting capability limit of the vehicle battery is reached. 

The Terminal 30F relay is a bistable relay and is always in the ON state under normal con¬ 
ditions. It switches off the connected electric loads only in the case of fault. Once the 
Terminal 30F relay has been switched off, one of the switch-on conditions must be met 
before it can be switched on again. 

Note: More information on this topic can be found in the Reference Information 
on the CAS.

General Measures 


The terminals "load shut-down" and the terminal "interior lighting" are switched off as a 
general measure when the vehicle is in stationary mode. This occurs only when the vehi¬ 
cle is not locked and secured. These loads are shut down immediately when the vehicle 
is locked and secured. This measure affects the following electric loads:

Components 

The components of the energy management system are: 

• Engine 

• Alternator 

• Vehicle battery 

• Intelligent battery sensor 

• Junction box module 

• Engine management (power management) 

• Loads. 

The most important components of the energy management system are described 
in the following. 

Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS) 

The intelligent battery sensor has a similar range of functions to the intelligent battery 
sensor on previous models. A new feature is data transmission between the IBS and the 
engine management module via LIN bus and the wake-up function of the IBS.

The intelligent battery sensor (IBS) is a mechatronic component for monitoring the 
battery condition. The description “intelligent” indicates that the IBS has an integral 
microprocessor. That microprocessor performs the computation and assessment of 
time-critical measured variables. 

The power supply for the IBS is provided by a separate lead from the power distribution 
box on the battery. The data from the IBS is passed to the higher-level control units 
(DME) via the LIN bus. If necessary, the IBS can wake up the Junction box module via a 
separate lead.

F01 Energy Management 






















The following physical battery variables are registered by the IBS: 

• Current 

• Voltage 

• Terminal temperature. 

Among other things, the following main functions are integrated in the IBS: 

• Continuous measurement of the battery current, voltage and temperature under all 
vehicle operating conditions. 

• Calculation of the battery indicators as the basis for the charge and health status of 
the battery. The battery indicators are charge and discharge current, voltage and 
temperature of the vehicle battery. Alongside calculation of the battery indicators, 
preliminary computation of the battery charge level (“state of charge”, SOC) is also 
carried out. 

• Balancing of the charge/discharge current of the battery. 

• Continuous monitoring of the battery charge status and making available the corre¬ 
sponding data in the event of insufficient battery power. 

• Calculation of the current progression when starting the engine to determine the 
battery health status. 

• Closed-circuit current monitoring of the vehicle. 

• Self-diagnosis 

Wake-up Function 

When the vehicle is in idle mode, the IBS continuously records the data relevant to the 
battery indicators. The IBS is programmed to wake up every 14 seconds in order to 
update the measured data by taking new readings. The time required to take the read¬ 
ings is approximately 50 milliseconds. The measured data is stored on the IBS in the 
memory for recording the closed-circuit current. 

The wake-up function applies only when the vehicle is in idle mode. If the IBS detects a 
wake-up trigger, the Junction box module is woken up by a PWM signal. The IBS is 
directly connected to the Junction box module via a separate lead. 


The pulse duty factor indicates the reason for the wake-up:

60% 

Raised closed-circuit current 


25 

F01 Energy Management 





A wake-up due to raised closed-circuit current can take place up to three times. 

Depending on the vehicle status and reason for the wake-up, the Junction box module 
performs one of the following actions: 

• Wakes up the vehicle so that the DME can send shut-down commands to 
electrical devices that are operating while the vehicle is in parked mode 

• Resets Terminal 30F (without waking up the vehicle) 

• Switches off Terminal 30F (without waking up the vehicle). 

A fault memory entry is registered in each case. 

Commissioning 

The IBS is fully functional as soon as it has been fitted to the battery terminal (screwed to 
the grounding point and connected to the signal leads), i.e. it can immediately detect the 
basic variables, current, voltage and temperature. 

However, the variables derived from those readings for the purposes of power manage¬ 
ment, i.e. battery condition, starting capacity, etc., must first be recalculated and, there¬ 
fore, there is a time lag before they are available. 

When the engine is restarted, the DME reads off the closed-circuit current progression. If 
it diverges from the defined closed-circuit current progression, a fault is registered in the 
DME fault memory. 

In the period between “Engine OFF” and when the DME main relay is switched off, the 
IBS is informed by the DME as to the maximum charge that can be drawn from the bat¬ 
tery on the basis of ensuring that the engine can be reliably restarted. After the DME 
main relay is switched off, the IBS continually checks the battery charge level (SOC) and 
the closed-circuit current.

Junction Box Module 


The Junction box module (JBE) is responsible for switching the Terminal 30F relay and 
for storing information (history data and fault memory entries) related to energy manage¬ 
ment. As part of vehicle diagnostics, these data can be used to evaluate faults and to 
analyse the vehicle battery. 



Engine Management (Power Management) 

The (power management) software for controlling the energy balance is located in the 
engine management. On the basis of that control algorithm, various electrical devices in 
the vehicle’s electrical system are switched off by the CAS control unit via the Terminal 
30B relay or by the Central Gateway Module and engine management module via the 
Terminal 30F relay. The power management is additionally responsible for evaluating and 
storing the IBS data.

Service Information 


Transport Mode 

Indication of Battery Condition 

The batteries in vehicles coming off the production line are adequately charged so that 
SOC > 80% (SOC = “State of charge”). However, since several days or weeks can pass 
between the time the vehicle comes off the production line and when it is delivered to 
the customer, the battery will have discharged to a greater or lesser degree. Therefore, 
every battery must be charged according to the recharging calendar. 

The F01/F02 is the first model on which it is possible to display the charge level of the 
battery when the new car is being transported. When production or transport mode is 
activated, a Check Control message is generated that provides a quick indication of the 
battery condition.

Note: If the SOC has dropped to less than 35%, the indication continues to be 
displayed on the instrument cluster until the battery is replaced and a 
change of battery is registered. 

Note: When transport mode is reset, there is no indication on the instrument 
cluster of the battery charge level. 

Note: If the vehicle is delivered with the red Check Control message “Battery 
charge level very low” active, it is essential that the low battery charge 
is recorded as transport damage on the delivery note. 


28 

F01 Energy Management 













In such cases, the test module “Energy diagnosis” must be carried out to establish the 
cause. Replace the battery before handing over the vehicle to the customer and register 
the change of battery using the service function. 

Note: If a vehicle is delivered with the yellow Check Control message “Charge 
battery”, this should also be recorded on the delivery note. The battery 
must then be charged once and an energy diagnosis carried out.

Closed-circuit Current 

Upwards of a closed-circuit current level of 80 mA, a Check Control message is generat¬ 
ed (raised battery discharge rate when parked). 

Note: The closed-circuit current should always be measured if increased cur¬ 
rent consumption is suspected. Even power consumption levels only 
slightly above normal can cause relatively rapid battery discharge. 

The graph below shows the typical closed-circuit current progression on the F01/F02 
associated with the various electrical system statuses. The actual current values change 
depending on the vehicle equipment configuration.

Load shut-down switches off immediately when the vehicle is secured. In all other termi¬ 
nal statuses, the load shut-down terminal is switched off after an overrun period of 8 min¬ 
utes. It is activated by the footwell module.

Electrical System and Battery Diagnosis 

Over the past few years, the energy management of all BMW models has been continu¬ 
ously improved and standardized across the various model series. In terms of energy 
diagnosis, this also means standardization of testing schedules and displays in the BMW 
diagnostic system. 

The aim of the diagnostic procedures is to show the causes of a discharged battery as 
unambiguously as possible. In view of the complexity, especially in the area of energy 
management, the specific cause of a fault can be shown only partially depending on its 
nature. The acguired energy diagnosis data are shown if the fault cannot be clearly 
assigned based on the acguired data. 

Power management is retained in full while the expanded diagnostic options are now resi¬ 
dent in the history memory. 

ZGM monitors the vehicle status, registers inhibited sleep mode or unauthorized wake-up 
after Terminal 30B is switched off and reguests a reset or shut-down of Terminal 30F by a 
bus message to the JBE. 

The originator and reason for wake-up (unauthorized wake-up) are stored as additional 
information in the ZGM fault memory. The driving profile for the last 5 weeks is stored in 
the JBE energy history memory. The energy history memory is referred to for energy 
diagnosis purposes.
