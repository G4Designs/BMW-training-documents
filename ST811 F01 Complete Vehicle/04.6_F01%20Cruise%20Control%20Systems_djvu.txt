Introduction 


Trusted Driver Assistance Systems 

BMW has long since offered a comprehensive range of driver assistance systems. These 
make it easier for the driver to control the vehicle, by 

• providing the driver with information, 

• prompting the driver how to act or 

• actively intervening in the way the vehicle is driven. 

The systems presented have, for the most part, already been tried and tested in BMW 
vehicles for many years. These include: 

• Cruise control with braking function 

• Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function 

• Adaptive Brake Assistant with warning function. 

The F01/F02 will see refinements and enhancements to improve customer benefits 
further still. 

Standard and Optional Equipment

F01 Cruise Control Systems 





















In the F01/F02, “Dynamic Cruise Control” (DCC) supersedes the cruise control (FGR) 
function available as standard in the E65. 

The optional extra “Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function” (ACC Stop & Go) 
provides optimum assistance to the driver not only in smoothly flowing traffic but also in 
traffic jam situations. Both systems are based on the new architecture of the Integrated 
Chassis Management (ICM). 

The primary aim of both items of optional eguipment, ACC and ACC Stop & Go, is to 
relax the driver and, therefore, to make an improvement to the comfort/convenience area 
of the vehicle. 

To assist the driver in panic braking situations as well, each of these items of optional 
eguipment has been enhanced by the Adaptive Brake Assistant function. This safety 
function, which was first available in the E6x LCI, has been supplemented by a new warn¬ 
ing function in the F01/F02. It alerts the driver to a risk of collision detected by the long- 
range radar sensor. This enables the driver to intervene even faster and, potentially, to 
avoid an accident.

Cruise Control with Braking Function 



Cruise control 


The cruise control with braking function has already featured in the BMW 3 Series (E9x). 

It is also referred to as “Dynamic Cruise Control” (DCC). 

It relieves the burden on the driver on quiet roads by maintaining a constant speed 
regardless of the resistance to vehicle motion (gradient, payload). 

It also offers the driver the opportunity to adjust the set speed in small or large incre¬ 
ments, which is then set and maintained by the system by controlling power output and 
braking. The brakes are also controlled during steep downhill driving if sufficient decelera¬ 
tion is not achieved by engine drag-torque alone. 

Dynamic Cruise Control in the F01/F02 is not computed in the DSC control unit as it is in 
other vehicles. Instead, it has been integrated into the ICM control unit. 

The function has, of course, been newly configured for optimum compatibility with the 
F01/F02. Due to the new vehicle interior, there are differences in how the function is 
operated and how information is displayed by comparison with the function implemented 
in other vehicles. These are described here. 


15 

F01 Cruise Control Systems 




Operation and display 

In the F01/F02, Dynamic Cruise Control is no longer operated by means of an operating 
lever. Instead, the driver can operate the function conveniently using a button pad on the 
multifunction steering wheel.

Explanation

SET button to activate 

2 

Rocker switch to change the set speed 

3 

I/O button to switch on and off 

4 

RES button to resume a stored set speed 


To prevent accidental activation, the function remains inoperable until the I/O button has 
been pressed after the vehicle has started. This switches the function to standby. This 
state is acknowledged in the instrument cluster by a green indicator light lighting up. 

With the function in standby, the driver is now able to activate cruise control. To do this, 
the driver can press the SET button used to store the vehicle’s current road speed as the 
set speed. An active state is indicated by a green indicator light in the circumference of 
the speedometer dial lighting up. 

There is an alternative way to activate the function if a set speed has already been stored. 
This is indicated by an orange indicator light in the circumference of the speedometer 
dial. If the driver wants to use this speed value as the set speed, he simply has to press 
the RES button. Dynamic Cruise Control then accelerates or decelerates the vehicle to 
this speed value automatically. 


16 

F01 Cruise Control Systems 














While the function is active, the driver is able to increase or decrease the set speed at any 
time. There are two adjustment increments available. The rocker switch offers two differ¬ 
ent increments in either direction. First, the set speed is altered in increments of 1 km/h 
each time the rocker switch is pressed; second, it is altered in increments of 10 km/h. 

Note: In the F01/F02, the adjustment range for the set speed is 30 km/h 
(18 mph) to 230 km/h (142mph). 

If the rocker switch is pressed and held, the system will accelerate/decelerate the vehicle 
until the rocker switch is released. This is known as a “comfort dynamics” function as fea¬ 
tured in the E9x and E6x LCI. 

To deactivate the system, the driver can simply operate the brake pedal like before. 

Or, the driver can deactivate the system by pressing the I/O button. The system is then 
returned to standby and keeps the set speed last used stored in its memory. 

If the driver then presses the I/O button once more, the system is completely switched off 
and the green indicator light in the instrument cluster goes out. 

There follows a summary of the most important displays for Dynamic Cruise Control.

In the event of particular operating states, the displays shown here are supplemented by 
information messages displayed below the speedometer. This is the case, for instance, if 
the driver attempts to activate the system even though not all the activation criteria have 
been fulfilled (e.g. speed less than 18 mph). 

In the F01/F02, a difference in the way Dynamic Stability Control interacts with Dynamic 
Cruise Control has been introduced. This is explained by the following example: Using the 
“Dynamic Performance Control”, the driver has selected a mode in which DSC is inactive 
(e.g. “Sport+” mode). If the driver now activates cruise control, DSC will be activated 
automatically. This is accompanied by an automatic changeover from “Dynamic 
Performance Control” to “Normal” mode. In previous vehicles, the driver was unable to 
activate cruise control without activating DSC manually first.

F01 Cruise Control Systems 













Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go Function 



Traffic jam situation 

The ACC Stop & Go function in the F01/F02 is largely identical to that in the E6x LCI. 

ACC Stop & Go extends the operating range of the former ACC system to include low 
speeds down to a standstill. In other words, speed and distance from the vehicle in front 
are automatically controlled at those speeds as well. 

ACC Stop & Go will automatically stop the car if necessary and then indicate to the driver 
as soon as it detects that it is possible to start moving again. To pull away again, the driver 
has to acknowledge this message. The pulling-away process is controlled fully automati¬ 
cally by ACC Stop & Go only if the duration of the standstill is very short. 

Thus, ACC Stop & Go provides optimum assistance for the driver not only in moving 
traffic but also in traffic jams such as are more and more freguently encountered on high¬ 
ways. Flowever, this system (in common with ACC) is not intended for use in urban areas 
for negotiating junctions or traffic lights. 

The functions of ACC Stop & Go in the F01/ F02 differ from those in the E6x LCI in the 
following areas: 

• Operation and display 

• Behavior in response to driver’s intention to get out. 


19 

F01 Cruise Control Systems 



Operation and display 

ACC Stop & Go and DCC are activated/ deactivated in a very similar way. The driver is 
able to activate ACC Stop & Go not only while the vehicle is in motion, but also when the 
vehicle is stationary, provided the system has detected another vehicle in front. To acti¬ 
vate ACC Stop & Go at a standstill, the driver has to depress the brake pedal and press 
the SET or RES button at the same time. The activation conditions that applied to the 
E6x LCI similarly apply here: 

• Brake pedal must not be depressed 

• Automatic transmission must be in Drive 

• Parking brake must not be activated 

• Radar sensors must be operational and not dirty 

• There must be no system fault present.

F01 Cruise Control Systems 










If Dynamic Stability Control was inactive before, in the F01/F02 it is activated as soon as 
ACC Stop & Go is activated. At the same time, the “Dynamic Performance Control” auto¬ 
matically changes to “Normal” mode (same behavior as for DCC). 

Similarly, ACC Stop & Go cannot be deactivated by means of the I/O button while the 
vehicle is stationary unless the brake pedal is depressed at the same time. 

Note: In the F01/F02, the adjustment range for the set speed is 30 km/h 
(18 mph) to 230 km/h (142mph). 

By comparison with DCC, a vehicle with ACC Stop & Go has an MFL button pad that 
additionally features two buttons for making distance adjustments. 

Each (short) button stroke to change the distance increases the desired distance used by 
ACC Stop & Go for its control process by one increment at a time. A total of four incre¬ 
ments are available to the driver. 


21 

F01 Cruise Control Systems 



The most important display functions of ACC Stop & Go in the F01/F02 are illustrated 
below. 

As with DCC, the display symbols for ACC Stop & Go are supplemented by messages 
displayed below the speedometer as and when necessary. 

If the vehicle is equipped with the head-up display option, the ACC displays also appear 
there, provided the driver has configured them to do so.

F01 Cruise Control Systems 



Behavior in response to the driver’s intention to get out 

ACC Stop & Go uses the DSC hydraulics to reliably slow the vehicle to a halt and keep it 
stationary. 


Without a supply of electricity, the DSC hydraulics are, however, unable to indefinitely 
maintain the braking force necessary to keep the vehicle stationary.

C 

Road traffic situation or perceptible response of vehicle with ACC Stop & Go 

1 

ACC Stop & Go is active and has automatically braked the vehicle to a halt behind a vehicle in 
front. The DSC hydraulics hold the vehicle stationary (and are monitored by the DSC control unit). 

2 

The driver has undone the seatbelt and opened the driver's door. This is evaluated as an unequiv¬ 
ocal signal for the driver's intention to get out. DSC detects this state and activates the parking 
brake function. As a result, the vehicle can be held stationary for any length of time, even if the dri¬ 
ver gets out. The parking brake indicator light indicates that the parking brake has been applied. 

ACC Stop & Go detects that the parking brake has been applied and switches off automatically. 


By contrast with the E6x LCI, the F01/F02 is equipped with an electromechanical parking 
brake (EMF). This is able to assume the function of holding the vehicle stationary if 

• DSC is no longer able to maintain the hold function due to a fault or overload, 

• the driver gets out or 

• the engine is switched off. 

Thanks to the EMF, therefore, ACC Stop & Go also benefits from improvements 
designed to enhance comfort while the vehicle is stationary. Drivers of an E6x LCI had to 
be issued with a warning if they were about to get out with ACC Stop & Go still active. 
They were reminded to secure the vehicle against rolling away. They had to apply the 
parking brake manually. 

In the F01/F02, however, the parking brake function of the EMF is activated automatically 
whenever the driver is about to get out of the vehicle with ACC Stop & Go still active. 

The driver’s intention to get out of the F01 / F02 is detected by the signals of the seat belt 
buckle contact (driver’s) and door contact (driver’s door). A signal from the seat occupan¬ 
cy detection (driver’s seat) is not used in the F01/F02. 

While the vehicle is being held stationary by ACC Stop & Go, the DSC unit takes over all 
monitoring and control processes. The DSC also controls the system’s behavior in 
response to the driver’s intention to get out of the vehicle. For ACC Stop & Go, this is 
absolutely identical to that implemented for the DSC-internal Automatic Hold function 
(see the “F01/F02 longitudinal dynamics systems” Product Information). 

ACC Stop & Go is deactivated automatically if, from the bus signals it receives, it detects 
that the parking brake function has been activated. Now the vehicle is still held stationary 
but by the parking brake function instead.

F01 Cruise Control Systems 




Adaptive Brake Assistant with Warning Function 



Panic braking situation 


As Featured in the E6x LCI 

The Adaptive Brake Assistant has been carried over from the E6x LCI. This function is 
included automatically if the customer orders the ACC Stop & Go option, or in some 
countries, the ACC option. 

Adaptive Braking Assistance offers the greatest benefit in situations where the vehicle is 
following another vehicle. If the vehicle in front brakes hard, it is detected by the long- 
range radar sensor. The two subfunctions of 

• precharging the brake system (also known as the “brake readiness” function) and 

• lowering the threshold for the hydraulic Brake Assistant 

assist the driver to perform the braking operation to best effect and thus in the best case 
to avoid a rear-end collision with the vehicle in front. 

In the F01/F02, this function is no different from the function implemented in the E6x LCI. 
The long-range radar sensor gathers data on the road users ahead of the vehicle. The 
data are supplemented by data relating to the driving status of the customer’s vehicle, 
and both types of data are used as a basis for calculating a collision avoidance rate of 
deceleration. This is the rate of deceleration at which the driver would have to brake in 
order to avoid a collision with the vehicle in front. If the calculated collision avoidance 
deceleration is above a stored threshold value, the brake system begins to precharge and 
the activation threshold for the hydraulic Brake Assistant is reduced. 

All sensor-related and processing functions of Adaptive Braking Assistance are computed 
in the long-range radar sensor. However, the computed output variables have to be trans¬ 
mitted to the DSC control unit because that is where they are put into action. To make 
this possible, the ICM control unit acts as a gateway between the local CAN and the 
FlexRay. 


26 

F01 Cruise Control Systems 




In the DSC control unit, there are still more conditions that need to be fulfilled before 
these two subfunctions can be carried out. (Example: road speed must be higher than a 
defined minimum speed.) 

However, the Adaptive Braking Assistance technology also has limits and cannot react 
fast enough in situations such as other road users cutting in right in front of the vehicle. 
Driving with care and anticipation remains the fundamental imperative even with Adaptive 
Braking Assistance! 

Note: The Adaptive Brake Assistant and its subfunctions ,precharging the 
brake system and lowering the threshold for the hydraulic Brake 
Assistant are always active and does not have to be switched on 
separately by the driver. 


27 

F01 Cruise Control Systems 



New warning function 

In the F01/F02, the Adaptive Brake Assistant is supplemented by a warning function. 

This useful “collision warning” is designed to draw the driver’s attention to hazardous 
situations in good time. The driver is then assisted by the subfunctions of the Adaptive 
Brake Assistant, which provide optimum deceleration in this kind of emergency situation. 

The driver is able to switch the collision warning on and off. Its state (on/off) remains 
stored for the duration of the current driving cycle (key-specific). 

The field of application in which the collision warning offers the greatest benefit to the 
customer is as follows: The customer is driving behind a vehicle that brakes suddenly and 
hard. 

If the customer has activated the collision warning, he is given notification in two stages 
that a hazardous situation has been detected and the customer is thereby prompted to 
intervene: 

• Advance warning 

• Acute warning. 

The time at which the warning has to be issued is, again, calculated by the long-range 
radar sensor based on the collision avoidance deceleration. Each warning stage has its 
own threshold values.

F01 Cruise Control Systems 



Setting the advance warning 

In the event of an advance warning, powerful braking by the driver is sufficient to allay the 
situation. If the acute warning is issued, the driver must brake immediately and with maxi¬ 
mum force to avoid a collision. 

The driver has some control over the threshold value for the activation of the first stage, 
the advance warning. From an Assistant window in the Central Information Display, the 
driver is able to select one of three warning times for the advance warning: 

• Early 

• Late 

• Off (no advance warning given). 

For the collision warning, the ICM control unit is responsible for the following control 
tasks. The switching on and off, the activation conditions, the fault monitoring and the 
adjustment of the warning time are all computed by the ICM. In addition, the ICM control 
unit forwards the warning reguest from the long-range radar sensor to the instrument 
cluster and (if fitted) the head-up display, where the warning is issued.

A 

Stage 1: Advance warning 

B 

Stage 2: Acute warning 


The advance warning is represented by the red car symbol in the instrument cluster. In 
the event of an advance warning, it lights up constantly. As there is no audible signal, this 
visual warning signal is the only signal for the advance warning. 


In the event of an acute warning, the car symbol in the instrument cluster begins to flash. 
Since an immediate intervention by the driver is reguired, this visual signal is supplement¬ 
ed by an audible tone.

Stage 1: Advance warning

Stage 2: Acute warning 


This particular high-freguency tone is used only for the acute warning and differs distinct¬ 
ly from other tones that are issued, e.g. with Check Control messages. 


If the vehicle is eguipped with the head-up display, the visual displays of the collision 
warning are seen by the driver even more directly and therefore even sooner. 

In the head-up display, the advance warning is represented by a significantly enlarged red 
car symbol. As with the instrument cluster display, the advance warning is indicated by 
the symbol lighting up constantly.

F01 Cruise Control Systems 
















In the event of an acute warning, the car symbol in the head-up display begins to flash. 

At the same time, the parts of the display that are irrelevant to this emergency situation 
are hidden so as not to distract the driver unnecessarily. These displays include those of 
the navigation system, for example. As soon as the acute warning is over, all the displays 
in the head-up display re-appear. The same distinctive tone for the acute warning is used 
in vehicles with head-up display. 

Note: The collision warning is active only if the driver has switched it on at the 
driver assistance systems operating unit. 

As the advance warning is the first warning stage, its timing is config¬ 
urable but it can also be switched off. 

Fault states 

The functions of the Adaptive Brake Assistant depend on the faultless operation of the 
long-range radar sensor in particular, but also of the ICM control unit and the DSC unit. 

If one of these essential system components is limited in its availability in anyway, these 
functions may no longer work correctly and would need to be deactivated. 

The driver is given notification of this condition. If, for example, a fault is present at the 
time the system is switched on, the function illumination of the collision warning will not 
be activated. From this, the driver can infer that the collision warning is not available. 

If a fault were to occur some time after the system was switched on, the driver could fail 
to see the function illumination go out. For this reason, a Check Control message is 
issued as an additional warning measure. There are two different symbols, and each 
one is supplemented by a relevant instruction.

Vehicle-specific Modifications in Detail 

Long-range Radar Sensor 

In terms of physical design, the long-range radar sensor (LRR) for ACC Stop & Go in the 
F01/F02 is largely identical to the one fitted in the E6x LCI. 

Functionally, however, it differs from the sensor in the E6x LCI in that it also calculates 
the new collision warning of the Adaptive Brake Assistant. 

In the F01/F02, the long-range radar sensor no longer has a connection to the wake-up 
line. Instead, it is supplied with power by terminal 15N and is thus hard switched. 
Terminal 15N is tapped off at the front fuse carrier. The long-range radar sensor contains 
a terminating resistor (for the local CAN) as it does in the E6x LCI. 

The installation location of the long-range radar sensor and the way it is mounted have 
been adapted to the structural conditions specific to the F01/F02.

Note: In the F01/F02, the long-range radar sensor is fitted with the connector

had to be relocated. 

Note: Adjusting the long-range radar sensor on vehicles with Integral Active 
Steering: Before the adjustment device is set up and the actual adjust¬ 
ment work can begin, it is necessary to bring the actuator for the rear- 
wheel steering to the straight-ahead position. It is essential that the 
instructions of the diagnostic system and Repair Instructions be 
observed. 

Short-range radar sensors 

The short-range radar sensors (SRR) used for ACC Stop & Go in the E6x LCI have 
undergone a hardware revision. New, integrated switch circuits have been implemented. 
The principle of operation, however, is much the same. The table below compares the 
sensors’ properties with those of the Lane Change Warning.

Note: As in the E6x LCI, the short-range radar sensors cannot be programmed. 
While they do have a self-diagnostics function, accessing the ICM con¬ 
trol unit is the only means by which it is possible to read their fault code 
memory entries. 

The short-range radar sensors on the left and right are identical, as they are in the E6x 
LCI. Each of the short-range radar sensors detects its respective installation position from 
the pin that is assigned to ground in the wiring harness. 

In the F01/F02, the short-range radar sensors -like the long-range radar sensor - are sup¬ 
plied with power by terminal 15N, which is supplied in turn by the front fuse carrier. There 
is no connection to the wake-up line. 

The local CAN is connected to the short-range radar sensors by two short stub lines, 
which begin at the long-range radar sensor. 

The short-range radar sensors have no terminating resistor for the local CAN. 

The F01/F02 and the E6x LCI differ greatly in the installation location of the short-range 
radar sensors and in the way they are mounted. The key differences are illustrated here 
using as an example a short-range radar sensor fitted on the right-hand side when viewed 
in the direction of travel.

F01 Cruise Control Systems 











In the F01/F02, the short-range radar sensors are fitted on top of the bumper carrier (and 
no longer on its front). For this reason, the bracket had to be completely redesigned. It 
now grips the housing of the short-range radar sensor from behind. To guarantee the 
necessary level of stability and reliability, the bracket now also has a reinforcement rib. 

This runs vertically to the front of the antenna cover. The rib was positioned here in order 
to minimize its interference with the propagation of radar waves. 

Note: The material for the bracket (and thus for the rib) was also selected 

specifically for this particular application. Emergency repairs that use 
other plastic parts are not permitted. Otherwise, there is a risk that the 
short-range radar sensors may not work correctly. 

For the short-range radar sensors, a distinction is made between the following types of 
fault: 

• Sensors dirty: The short-range radar sensors can no longer function reliably if their 
antenna is covered by snow, slush or ice. If this condition is detected, a correspond¬ 
ing signal is sent to the ICM control unit. The ACC Stop & Go function is deactivated 
as a result. A separate Check Control message informs the driver about this special 
case. There is no fault code memory entry. 

• External interference with radar signal processing: Radar sensors used by 
other vehicle manufacturers may interfere with the signal evaluation of the short- 
range radar sensors. If such a problem is detected, the ACC Stop & Go is deactivat¬ 
ed. It can be switched on again by the driver as soon as the vehicle is far enough 
away from the vehicle causing the interference. This malfunction is logged in the 
fault code memory of the ICM control unit. However, there is no repair action that 
can be taken. Instead, the customer should be informed of the cause of the fault 
(external interference). 

• Temporary fault: The causes of this type of fault include communication faults, 
overvoltage, undervoltage and thermal overloads in the short-range radar sensors. In 
these cases, it is necessary to proceed as instructed by the test plan in the diagnos¬ 
tic system. The short-range radar sensors must not be replaced unless the test plan 
prompts you to do so. 

• Control unit fault: If one of the short-range radar sensors is affected by a control 
unit fault, the only way to rectify the fault is to replace the defective sensor. 

• Sensors maladjusted: As with the long-range radar sensor, the short-range radar 
sensors in interaction with the ICM control unit are also able to detect a maladjust¬ 
ment caused by an accident. If the calculated degree of maladjustment exceeds a 
certain limit, the ACC Stop & Go function is shut down. An entry in the fault memory 
indicates the cause of the fault. To correct the fault, observe the instructions in the 
diagnostic system and Repair Instructions. 


35 

F01 Cruise Control Systems 



In the F01/F02, too, as with the long-range radar sensor, there is no means of adjusting 
the short-range radar sensors. 

Note: If a short-range radar sensor has been replaced with a new one, it is nec¬ 
essary to commission the sensor using the diagnostic system. While 
commissioning is in progress, new short-range radar sensors are taught 
their respective installation position and, importantly, their angle rela¬ 
tive to the vehicle longitudinal axis. A measurement does not need to be 
carried out in this case. The angle entered is the angle predetermined by 
the construction and the form of the bumper support. 

Note: Great care must taken during repair work carried out at the front end. If 
the bumper carrier is deformed or if the bumper trim is scratched or 
dented, the short-range radar sensors may no longer work correctly. The 
specified structural clearances between the short-range radar sensors 
and the bumper trim must also be maintained. The Repair Instructions 
must be observed without fail.

New Components 


Integrated Chassis Management 

The new ICM control unit in the F01/F02 essentially performs the calculations for the 
control functions that influence the longitudinal and lateral dynamics. The ICM control 
unit also contains the control functions of “Dynamic Cruise Control” and “Active Cruise 
Control with Stop & Go function”. 

In addition, the ICM coordinates the control of the vibration actuator in the steering wheel 
for the “Lane Departure Warning” and “Lane Change Warning” driver assistance func¬ 
tions. Also integrated into the ICM control unit are micromechanical sensors that supply 
the driving dynamics signals (in previous vehicles, these were generated by the separate 
DSC sensor). 

Two versions 

An ICM control unit is installed in every F01/ F02. Which of the two available versions of 
the ICM control unit is fitted depends on the vehicle’s equipment level. 

If the vehicle is equipped with one or both of the following options 

• Integral Active Steering (IAL) or 

• Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function (ACC Stop & Go), 

the high-performance version of the ICM control unit is installed. 

If neither of these options are installed in the vehicle, the basic version of the ICM control 
unit is used. 

The internal layout of the high-end version differs from the internal layout of the basic ver¬ 
sion in the following ways: 

• Larger microprocessor (required to calculate the Integral Active Steering control and 
active speed control) 

• Redundant sensor system for lateral acceleration and yaw rate (safety requirement 
for Integral Active Steering).

Electrical interfaces 

The control unit has a 54-pin plug via which the power supply, sensors, actuators and 
bus systems are connected. 

As is the case with the controller housing, the plug does not have a watertight design. 
This is not necessary as it is installed on the inside of the vehicle. 

The ICM control unit is connected to the integrated FlexRay controller via the FlexRay 
bus system. A detailed description of the new features of the FlexRay network is provided 
in the Product Information for the F01/F02 bus systems. The communication with most 
partner control units is handled by the microprocessors in the ICM via the FlexRay. 

The FlexRay is routed to the ICM control unit (from the central gateway module) and con¬ 
tinues from there (to the DME). The ICM control unit is related to the FlexRay, i.e. not an 
end node. This is why it does not have a terminating resistor for the FlexRay. 

A further bus system, a local CAN, is connected to the ICM control unit in addition to 
the FlexRay. Its sole purpose is to enable the ICM to communicate with the long-range 
radar sensor and the short-range radar sensors. This local CAN therefore performs the 
same tasks as the sensor CAN in the E6x LCI that connects the LDM control unit to the 
sensors. It transmits information on road users that has been recorded by the sensors. 

The local CAN operates in the same way as the PT-CAN with a data transfer rate of 500 
kBit/s. There are two terminating resistors for the local CAN, each with 120 .. One of 
these is in the ICM control unit, the second terminating resistor is integrated in the long- 
range radar sensor. The local CAN is routed to the short-range radar sensors by short 
stub lines. 

The pins for the local CAN are only connected at the plug of the ICM control unit if it is a 
high-end version. 

The ICM control unit is also connected to the wake-up line. The ICM control unit can 
be woken up via the wake-up line. 

Power is supplied from the front fuse carrier by terminal 30B.

Installation location 

The ICM control unit is installed in the center console behind the sensor for the crash 
safety module. This means that the position of the control unit and its integrated sensor 
system in the vehicle -near to its center of gravity -is ideal from the point of view of driving 
dynamics. The mounting points on the body are precisely determined and are measured 
when the vehicle is manufactured and must not be replaced with any other mounting 
points.

The housing of the control unit is connected to the metal body of the transmission tunnel 
with four screws and spacer sleeves made of aluminum. The control unit must be mount¬ 
ed on the vehicle body free of play as otherwise vibrations may be induced in the control 
unit housing which would severely impair the operation of the integrated sensor system. 

A secondary task of this mounting is to conduct heat away from the control unit to the 
body. 

For the mounting to be able to perform these tasks, the following points must be 
observed when mounting and replacing the ICM control unit: 

Note: Only screws and spacer sleeves that are in perfect condition may 
be used. Deformed or damaged fixing elements must not be used. 

The mounting screws in the reamed holes must be tightened first, 
followed by the other two screws. The tightening torque specified 
in the repair instructions must be observed without fail. 

A check must then be carried out to make sure the control unit is 
mounted securely and free of play. 

To ensure sufficient heat dissipation and to avoid vibrations, the sides and top of the con¬ 
trol unit housing must not come into contact with other vehicle components. Instead, the 
spaces provided around the control unit as part of the engineering design must always 
remain free of other components. 


42 

F01 Cruise Control Systems 



Removing and installing the ICM control unit 

The ICM control unit performs tasks that are important for many vehicle functions, e.g. 
provision of sensor signals. If the vehicle were operated without the ICM control unit 
installed, a large number of vehicle functions would not be available. In the area of dynam¬ 
ic driving systems, for example, the Servotronic and stabilization functions would no 
longer be available. In addition, fault code memory entries would inevitably also be gener¬ 
ated in many control units. 

Note: If the ICM control unit needs to be replaced, the repair instructions must 
be observed without fail. 

For example, the vehicle battery must be disconnected before removing 
the control unit and reconnected following the installation. This is the 
only way to ensure synchronized restarting of the control unit assembly. 

Note: Once the new ICM control unit has been installed, it must be started up 
with the assistance of the diagnostic system. To do this, the following 
steps must be carried out (depending on the equipment specification): 

• Calibration of the sensors integrated into the ICM 

• Calibration of the ride-height sensors 

• Initialization of the Integral Active Steering. 

Commissioning the short-range radar sensors 

In vehicles with the ACC Stop & Go option, the ICM control unit also plays an important 
role in the interaction with the short-range radar sensors. 

Although short range radar sensors are intelligent sensors that perform the functions of a 
control unit they cannot be accessed directly via the diagnostic system. The ICM control 
unit acts as a “go-between” between the short range radar sensors and the diagnostic 
system which is why the ICM also controls the start-up process for the short range radar 
sensors. 

Note: The short range radar sensors for ACC Stop & Go must be started up if 
one (or both) short range radar sensor(s) is/are replaced. In this instance, 
the diagnostic system communicates with the ICM control unit. The ICM 
in turn controls the corresponding functions in the short range radar 
sensors.

The ICM does not allow the collision warning to switch on unless the entire system is 
working faultlessly. It is only then that a bus signal providing positive feedback is sent to 
the FRM in order to have the function illumination in the button light up. If, however, a 
fault is present in any part of the entire system, the function illumination remains off even 
if the button is pressed. From this, the driver can infer that the collision warning is not 
available.

Multifunction steering wheel button pad 

Which version of the MFL button pad on the left-hand spoke of the multifunction steering 
wheel is fitted depends on which option, DCC or ACC Stop & Go, is fitted in the vehicle. 
This does not apply to the MFL button pad on the right-hand spoke, which is the same 
regardless of whether the vehicle is eguipped with DCC or ACC Stop & Go. 

The operation and function of the buttons were described in the “functions” section.

The electronics of the multifunction steering wheel evaluate the button strokes on both

switch cluster (SZL). The SZL forwards the button stroke signals to the ICM control unit 
on the FlexRay. This is where the signals for controlling the DCC and ACC Stop & Go 
function are evaluated. 

There is no function illumination on the MFL button pad. For this reason, no feedback is 
sent by the ICM control unit to the MFL button pad as it is to the driver assistance sys¬ 
tems operating unit.
