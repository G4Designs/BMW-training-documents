Introduction 


F01/F02 Available with Automatic Soft Close Function 

The Automatic Soft Close function (SCA) is available and can be ordered as of volume 
production launch. 

The Automatic Soft Close function requires the installation of suitable door locks with 
drives for Automatic Soft Close (SCA drives). 

The particular feature of this Automatic Soft Close function is that the door lock and the 
Automatic Soft Close drive unit are no longer a single unit. The Automatic Soft Close 
drive unit is separate and controls the door lock by way of a cable. 

This means that the lock and the drive can be fitted separately and the installation space 
available can be used to the best effect. 

The Automatic Soft Close option is only available for all doors on the vehicle. 

The benefit of the Automatic Soft Close function is that the doors only have to be 
pushed or pulled lightly into the lock. This action starts the Automatic Soft Close func¬ 
tion which closes the doors fully. 

Note: The Automatic Soft Close function for the trunk is standard equipment 
and thus is not part of this option.

Functions 


Automatic Soft Close 

The Automatic Soft Close function is an autonomous function. The only connection to 
the car’s electrical system is Terminal 30 basic mode (Terminal 30B) and the ground 
connection. The Automatic Soft Close function is operational as of “Terminal 30B ON”. 

Circuit Diagram for an Automatic Soft Close System 

The electronics for controlling and monitoring the function are located in the Automatic 
Soft Close function drive. 

The sensors for the Automatic Soft Close function are Hall-effect sensors and are locat¬ 
ed in the locks. The Hall sensors are built into the lock of each vehicle door. One Hall 
sensor is for the locking pawl, the other for the rotary striker.

The Automatic Soft Close function analyzes the status of the Hall sensors. The 
Automatic Soft Close drive units are operated or moved back to their starting position 
according to status. 

The Automatic Soft Close function drive is connected to lock by way of a Bowden cable 
and a 3 wire cable.

Locking Procedure when Door is Pushed into the Lock 

Starting position: Door open, the Automatic Soft Close function is in the standby position. 

When the door is closed normally, first the locking pawl (lock) Hall sensor changes its sta¬ 
tus. The electronics in the Automatic Soft Close function drive start the door closing 
operation after a delay of 200 ms. This prevents the Automatic Soft Close drive unit start¬ 
ing before the lock bolt is located in the rotary striker. The drive operates the rotary striker 
by way of the Bowden cable until the Hall sensor for the rotary striker changes its status. 
The locking pawl is then engaged and secured in the rotary striker. Operation of the 
Automatic Soft Close drive unit is then stopped and the Automatic Soft Close drive unit 
returns to its parked position. 

When the door is opened using the outside door handle (bow handle) or inside door han¬ 
dle, the system runs back to its original position. This is also known as the standby posi¬ 
tion. 

Note: Only when the rotary striker sensor has changed its status is the rotary 
striker mechanically locked by the locking pawl. This is particularly 
important, as only then is it guaranteed that the door is truly closed.

Closing the Door by Slamming 

Slamming the door would make closing with the Automatic Soft Close function drive 
unnecessary. However, since it is essential to ensure that the door is definitely closed, the 
Automatic Soft Close drive unit is nevertheless still operated for safety reasons. 

The electronic circuitry in the Automatic Soft Close drive unit detects the slamming of 
the door by the fact that the locking pawl and rotary striker Hall-effect sensors have 
changed their status within a short time. 

Anti-repeat Circuit 

Every Automatic Soft Close function drive has an anti-repeat circuit to prevent overheat¬ 
ing of the Automatic Soft Close function drive. It permits 15 operations (counter incre¬ 
mented up to 15 times) of the control for the Automatic Soft Close function drive. The 
Automatic Soft Close function drive is then locked electrically for approximately 2 min¬ 
utes.

Light closing causes the advance detent tooth (3) of the rotary striker (1) to engage on 
the locking pawl (6). The Automatic Soft Close function drive pulls on the actuating lever 
(5). The actuating lever rotates the rotary striker by means of the pull latch (4) until it is 
rotated over the main detent tooth (7). The locking pawl can now engage in the main 
detent tooth of the rotary striker. The rotary striker is thus secured and the lock can no 
longer open by itself.

The Automatic Soft Close function drive motor (6) has a two-start worm (4) on its shaft. 
This permits drive in the CLOSE direction for the Automatic Soft Close function. The 
rotary motion of the drive worm is transferred to the driven wheel (3) by the idler gear (5). 
The drive gear transfers the rotary motion to the Bowden cable (1). This means that the 
actuating lever in the lock is pulled by the Bowden cable and thus the vehicle door is fully 
closed.

Service Information 


Lock and Drive 

The lock and the Automatic Soft Close function drive are a closed unit (modular). This 
means that a faulty lock or Automatic Soft Close function drive cannot be replaced indi¬ 
vidually. Opening the drive, for instance, destroys it, and perfect operation is no longer 
guaranteed. The Automatic Soft Close function drive is inseparably fastened to the lock. 
The lock and the Automatic Soft Close drive unit can only be ordered together as spare 
parts. 

Note: There is no diagnostic function for the Automatic Soft Close function 
drive in the diagnostics system. Retrofitting the Automatic Soft Close 
system would be very complicated and is therefore not envisaged. 

There is no diagnostic function for the Automatic Soft Close function 
drive in the diagnostics system.
