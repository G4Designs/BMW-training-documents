F01 Central Locking System 


Introduction 


Unlocking and Locking the Vehicle 

The central locking system makes it possible to unlock or lock the vehicle. It is fitted as 
standard equipment and relates to all vehicle doors, the fuel filler flap and the trunk. 

The central locking can be operated via the following components: 

• ID transmitter 

• Driver’s-door lock barrel (door lock) 

• Central-lock button 

• Trunk lock barrel 

• Exterior trunk button 

• Interior trunk button in the A-pillar 

• Outside door handle * (outside door handle electronics/Car Access System) 

• Central locking button in the trunk lid *. 

* Component of the Comfort Access option. 

The central locking system in the F01/F02 is based on the central locking system as it is 
already known in, for instance, the E90 or E70. The function of the central locking 
system is basically divided between three control units. 

The Car Access System has overall control. The Car Access System is aware of the sta¬ 
tuses of the central locking system. Therefore it is the Car Access System which causes 
the unlocking, locking and central locking of the vehicle. 

The junction box electronics module executes the request to unlock or lock the vehicle. 

Note: The Car Access System is now entering its fourth control-unit genera¬ 
tion and contains the functions of its predecessor. 

With Car Access System 4, Comfort Access functionality is now also 
integrated into this control unit. This means that, on the F01/F02 there 
is no separate control unit for Comfort Access. 

It is possible to unlock and lock the vehicle actively or passively. 

• Active means that the vehicle can be opened after it has been unlocked by a press 
of the button on the ID transmitter. The vehicle can be locked by pressing the Lock 
button after the doors have been closed. 

Note: The vehicle can only be locked with the driver’s door closed. 


5 

F01 Central Locking System 





Passive locking and unlocking reguires the option Comfort Access. 

• Passive means the vehicle is unlocked when the outer door handle is grasped, 
provided the ID transmitter is located within a radius of no more than approxiamately 
1.5 meters from the vehicle. The locking function is triggered by pressing on the 
sensitive area on the outer door handle. 

The trunk is fitted with the automatic soft-close function as standard. With the automatic 
soft-close function, it is sufficient to gently press the trunk into the trunk lock. As soon as 
the locking pawl reaches the pre-locking position, automatic soft-close fully closes the 
trunk. The locking pawl is then located in the main locking position. 

An alternative is automatic soft-close, the automatic soft-close function is available for all 
vehicle doors. When eguipped with the automatic soft-close function, the vehicle door 
needs only to be gently pulled or pushed into the lock. The automatic soft-close function 
then completely closes the door. 

The Car Access System (4) evaluates the signal from the ID transmitter (1) and reguests 
the unlocking or locking of the vehicle. The junction box electronics module (8) executes 
the reguests. 

The lock barrel (12) in the driver's door is used for mechanically unlocking or locking the 
door. The footwell module (10) evaluates the movement (status of Hall sensors) of the 
lock barrel and the status of the door contacts.

The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the rear window antenna. The 
remote control receiver integrated in the diversity module (19) forwards the signal to the 
Car Access System (2). After the signal has been successfully checked, the Car Access 
System issues a request for control of the central locking system. The Car Access 
System is the master control unit for the central locking system. 

The junction box electronics module (4) executes the unlocking or locking of the vehicle. 

The footwell module (1) evaluates the status of all door contacts (6, 8,14 and 16). 

It communicates the current status on the KCAN2. This means, for example, that the Car 
Access System is able to prevent locking when the driver’s door is open. 

The status of the center-lock button (3) is evaluated by the Car Access System and 
communicated over the K-CAN2. Depending on the status, the junction box electronics 
module activates central locking. The junction box electronics modules is also responsi¬ 
ble for registering the status and activating central locking in the trunk. 

The junction box electronics module is also responsible for controlling the fuel filler flap 

( 10 ). 

The footwell module evaluates the signals from the Hall sensors for the lock barrel (16) 
and makes this information available on the K-CAN2. 

With this information, the Car Access System knows the status of the door lock in the dri¬ 
ver’s door. This is important if a request is issued to unlock or lock the vehicle using the 
ID transmitter, for example. 

The central locking button is integrated in the underside of the trunk and is part of the 
Comfort Access option.

Functional Procedure 
Unlocking 

Pressing the Unlock button on the ID transmitter causes an encrypted remote control 
signal to be transmitted. The antenna in the rear window forwards the remote control sig¬ 
nal to the diversity module. The diversity module remote control receiver demodulates, 
processes and then sends the signal to the Car Access System on the LIN bus. 

If the vehicle is in sleep mode, the remote control receiver wakes up the Car Access 
System via the LIN bus for reduced-consumption operation. This allows the Car Access 
System to receive the request which was sent out by the ID transmitter. The ID transmit¬ 
ter has already been checked in the remote control receiver. If the result of the check is 
positive, the remote control receiver forwards the request via the LIN bus. If the request is 
authorized, the Car Access System wakes up the vehicle and causes the vehicle to 
unlock. The Car Access System thereby gives the junction box electronics module per¬ 
mission to unlock the central-locking drive. 

The junction box electronics module then activates the relay and power output stages 
and triggers the unlocking of the vehicle. 

Note: The Car Access System is responsible for communication over the LIN 
bus. This means that the diversity module only passes on a LIN bus sig¬ 
nal when instructed to do so by the Car Access System 4. This applies to 
vehicles not currently in sleep mode. 


13 

F01 Central Locking System 
































Locking 

The vehicle can only be locked once the footwell module has evaluated the door con¬ 
tacts and the Car Access System 4 has reported that the driver’s door is closed. 

The further signal progression for locking the vehicle corresponds analogously to the sig¬ 
nal progression of the unlocking procedure. 

During the vehicle locking process, all central locking drives are moved into the “Lock” 
position. The central-locking drives in the doors are additionally moved into the “centrally- 
locked” position. Following the central arrest procedure, the locking buttons in the doors 
are mechanically separated from the central locking drive system. 

The vehicle can now no longer be unlocked using the locking buttons in the doors. 

Note: The trunk can either be locked manually or using automatic trunk actua¬ 
tion. 


Central locking button 

The central locking button can be used to lock and centrally lock all vehicle doors. 

The central locking button is located on the underside of the trunk and can therefore only 
be used with the trunk open. 

Additional information is presented under the Central locking button section, which fol¬ 
lows. 

Center-lock Button 

The vehicle can be locked/unlocked with the center-lock button. 

If the center-lock button is not being pressed, the junction box electronics module 
receives a high signal (battery voltage approxiamately 12 V). The high signal changes 
to a low signal (approximately 0 V) as soon as the center-lock button is pressed. 

The junction box electronics module evaluates the change from the high signal to the low 
signal and locks/unlocks the vehicle. 

In order for locking or unlocking to take place, the driver’s door and front passenger door 
must be closed. 


14 

F01 Central Locking System 



Mechanical Key/Spare Key 

The mechanical key/spare key is used to unlock/lock the driver’s door. Should the ID 
transmitter fail, e.g. if the battery is flat, it is still possible to access or lock the vehicle. 

Driver’s-door lock barrel 

The footwell module evaluates the Hall sensors for the lock barrel in the driver’s door. 

The Car Access System 4 is informed of the change in status via the K-CAN2. 

The Car Access System 4 enables the vehicle unlocking/locking procedure. The junction 
box electronics module triggers the unlocking/ locking of the vehicle. 

The normal procedure for unlocking or locking using the mechanical key occurs within a 
period of approxiamately 20 ms to 1 second. Evaluation of the lock barrel Hall sensors 
occurs within this period of time. 

Note: Turning the mechanical key in the driver’s-door lock barrel too quickly or 
slowly, means that only the driver’s door will be mechanically unlocked 
or locked. In such situations, the central locking system does not oper¬ 
ate. 

Trunk lock 

The trunk lock can be unlocked by using the mechanical key in the lock barrel, and then 
opened. 

Note: If the anti-theft alarm system is fitted, unlocking the trunk may trigger an 
alarm. 

To close the trunk, the trunk must be pushed into the trunk lock. As soon as the locking 
pawl reaches the pre-locking position, automatic soft-close begins and closes the trunk. 

Note: In the F01, the trunk lock is pulled closed via an automatic soft-close 
drive. Slamming the trunk closes the trunk so quickly that automatic 
soft-close is not activated. 


15 

F01 Central Locking System 



Locking Button on Vehicle Doors 

All four doors can be mechanically locked separately with the locking button. 

The inside door handle of the door to be unlocked must be pulled twice before the door 
will unlock. 

However, the junction box electronics module does not activate central locking. 

If the vehicle is centrally locked, the locking knobs are mechanically disconnected from 
the lock. It is thus no longer possible to unlock the vehicle either via the locking knobs or 
by pulling twice on the door handle. On vehicles with an anti-theft alarm system, this also 
activates the system. 

Car Access System 4 

As soon as the Car Access System 4 receives the signal from the remote control receiver, 
it checks whether the ID transmitter is valid and belongs to the vehicle. Only if the check 
is successful will the Car Access System 4 forward the reguest to the central locking. 

The check, also referred to as authentication, takes a few milliseconds. As the master 
control unit of the central locking system, the Car Access System 4 grants authorization 
for control of the central locking system. 

The junction box electronics module receives the enable via the K-CAN2. 

Junction Box Electronics Module 

The junction box electronics module is the The trunk central locking system is activated 
slave control unit which unlocks/locks the directly via a power output stage, entire vehicle. 
The unlocking/locking relays are located in the junction box electronics module. The fol¬ 
lowing relays are activated: 

• Relay for unlocking/locking central locking 

- Driver’s door. 

• Relay for unlocking/locking central locking 

- Rear doors 

- Front passenger door 

- Fuel filler flap. 

Footwell Module 

The footwell module monitors the Hall The reguest to lock the vehicle, for example, is 
sensors of the door contacts. Opening or not executed while the driver’s door is open, 
closing a door causes a change in status of the door contact in guestion to occur. 

The junction box electronics module receives the current status of the door contacts from 
the footwell module via the K-CAN2. The junction box electronics module passes the 
status of the door contacts on to the Car Access System 4. 


16 

F01 Central Locking System 



Unlocking the Trunk 

The trunk can be unlocked via the ID transmitter and the exterior or interior trunk button, 
and then opened. 

ID transmitter 

The ID transmitter is used to trigger the unlocking of the trunk by means of a brief 
(approximately 500 ms) press on the trunk symbol button. 

The junction box electronics module executes the unlocking of the trunk. 

The motor in the trunk lock is activated via the power output stage in the junction box 
electronics module. 

Note: If the vehicle is fitted with the automatic trunk actuation option, 
the trunk symbol button must be pressed and held for longer than 
1.2 seconds. 

Exterior trunk button 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked, the trunk can be opened with the exterior trunk but¬ 
ton in the trunk. The button switches to ground when the exterior trunk button is pressed. 

The button is monitored by the junction box electronics. When the signal of the button 
changes to low, the trunk is unlocked and can be opened.

Interior trunk button in the A-pillar 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked, the trunk can be unlocked and opened by pressing 
the interior trunk button. 

The button is integrated into the A-pillar and switches to ground. 

The Car Access System evaluates the button and sends the signal for the junction box 
electronics module over the K-CAN2. The junction box electronics module evaluates the 
message and triggers the trunk to unlock. 

Closing the trunk 

Gently pressing the trunk into the trunk lock triggers the automatic soft-close drive. 

A microswitch in the trunk lock is activated by the locking pawl being located in the pre¬ 
locking position. The drive electronics for automatic soft-close assess the change in sta¬ 
tus as a starting signal. 

The drive then pulls the rotary striker closed via a Bowden cable. As soon as the locking 
pawl engages in the main locking position, the automatic soft-close drive is stopped. 

Note: The automatic soft-close drive serves to ensure that the trunk closes 
both safely and securely. 

Special Functions 

Automatic locking (personal profiles) 

At speeds in excess of 16 km/h (10 mph), the vehicle locks automatically. The speed sig¬ 
nal is supplied by the Integrated Chassis Management. 

The vehicle is unlocked in connection with Comfort Access as soon as terminal 15 is 
switched off. 

Note: Various functions of the central locking system can be individually cus¬ 
tomized using “personal profiles”. Refer to the Owner’s Handbook for 
further information. 

Unlocking after a crash 

A locked central locking system is unlocked as soon as the Car Access System 4 
receives a crash message from the advanced crash safety management. 

After this crash message is received, the central locking controls are blocked. 

The controls are only enabled again after Advanced Safety Crash Management (ASCM) 
stops sending the crash message or if, after 10 seconds, the crash message is no longer 
received. 

Selective unlocking 

With corresponding coding, the vehicle can also be unlocked selectively. In this case, ini¬ 
tially the driver’s door is unlocked. The rest of the vehicle is unlocked in response to a 
renewed unlock reguest. 


18 

F01 Central Locking System 



Central Locking Button 

A new function for the central locking system is the ability to activate central locking from 
the trunk. 

The central locking button is located on the underside of the trunk. Whether or not the 
button is present depends on which eguipment is installed on the vehicle. 

Pressing the central locking button locks and centrally locks all vehicle doors. 

Note: The central locking button is only accessible with the trunk open. 

The button status is evaluated by the Car Access System. If the vehicle is in sleep mode, 
it must first be woken up. 

The Car Access System recognizes that the central locking button has been pressed and 
locks and centrally locks the car as appropriate.

System Components 

Components of the Central Locking System 


Footwell Module 

The footwell module is installed at the left-hand A-pillar. It evaluates the status of the 
door contacts and reads in the Hall sensor signals of the lock barrel in the driver’s door 
and transfers the information via the K-CAN2 to the junction box electronics module or 
Car Access System 4. 

Car Access System 4 

The Car Access System 4 is installed on the right, above the steering column. It 
assumes the master function for the central locking system. The Car Access System 4 
has the exclusive system authorization and is simply supported by the other control 
units. 

The Car Access System 4 also registers the status of the center lock button. The Car 
Access System 4 activates central locking, depending on the status of the central lock¬ 
ing system. Briefly pressing the center lock button triggers the vehicle to lock or unlock. 

The Car Access System evaluates the status of the interior trunk button on the A-pillar 
and the central locking button on the trunk. 

Junction Box Electronics Module 

The junction box electronics module is plugged into the front power distribution box. 

Note: The power distribution box and the junction box electronics module are 
two separate components. This must be borne in mind when performing 
service work. 

The junction box electronics module contains the relays for activating the central locking 
drive units. 

The trunk central locking is activated via a power output stage in the junction box elec¬ 
tronics module. 

The status of the exterior trunk button is read by the junction box electronics module 
and this information is passed on to the Car Access System 4. 

The automatic soft-close drive and the remote control receiver are supplied with power 
by the rear power distribution box. 

Controls 

The central locking can be operated from the following controls (among others): 

• ID transmitter 

• Driver’s-door/trunk lock barrel 


20 

F01 Central Locking System 




• Central locking button 

• Interior trunk button in the A-pillar 

• Central locking button. 

ID transmitter 

Each vehicle is supplied with a purse key/ spare key and two ID transmitters. 

The adapter for the spare key is located in the glove compartment. 

Note: Up to eight ID transmitters can be used in conjunction with the Comfort 
Access function. Four ID transmitters can be used for personal profiles. 

The ID transmitter has one button for locking and one for unlocking the vehicle. There is 
a separate button for unlocking the trunk. Pressing the trunk symbol button triggers auto¬ 
matic closing/opening of the trunk. Automatic closing requires the automatic trunk actua¬ 
tion option. 

The ID transmitter contains a battery which lasts up to four years. 

The mechanical key is located in the ID transmitter. 

Note: The passenger airbag can also be deactivated/activated with the 
mechanical key.

Driver’s-door lock barrel 

The lock barrel is connected mechanically via a linkage to the door lock. Hall sensors for 
the lock barrel are integrated in the door lock. 

The footwell module evaluates the signals from the Hall sensors for locking/unlocking 
purposes. 

Trunk locking barrel 

The lock barrel is connected mechanically via a Bowden cable to the trunk lock. Turning 
the spare key in the lock barrel opens the trunk lock.

Note: The center lock button can also be operated when the vehicle is locked. 
However, opening the vehicle door will trigger an alarm from the anti¬

Central Locking Drive Units 

A central locking drive unit consists of an electric drive unit and the unlocking/locking 
mechanism. 

Central locking drive units in the doors 

The central locking drive units in the doors are equipped with two motors to facilitate the 
unlocking/locking and central arrest functions of the vehicle. 

Central arrest means that the locking button in the doors is separated mechanically from 
the central locking drive unit. 

As a result, the vehicle cannot be opened by pulling the locking button. 

The Hall sensor for the door contact is additionally integrated in the central locking drive 
unit. 

Trunk central locking drive (trunk lock) 

The central locking drive for the trunk is equipped with a motor for unlocking. 

The central locking drive contains two microswitches which are actuated by the locking 
pawl. If the locking pawl is in the pre-locking position, the status of the microswitch 
changes from a high signal to a low signal. The electronics in the automatic soft-close 
drive register the status and activate the drive. As soon as the locking pawl engages in 
the main locking position, the drive stops. 


23 

F01 Central Locking System 










Note: The junction box electronics module evaluates the status of the 

microswitch. The junction box electronics module sends the status via 
the K-CAN2. This applies to vehicles with automatic trunk actuation. 

The trunk lift requires this information so that it can start at the right 
time, and not cause damage to the trunk lock. 

The second microswitch is used to switch on the luggage compartment lighting. The 
change in the status of the microswitch which occurs when the trunk is opened or closed 
is also used to monitor the trunk for the purposes of the anti-theft alarm system. 

Automatic soft-close drive for the trunk 

The automatic soft-close drive is connected to the trunk lock with a Bowden cable. This 
has the benefit that the drive can be fitted regardless of the available installation space. 
The drive is connected to terminal 30B. The fuse is located in the rear power distribution 
box. An electronics module is integrated into the automatic soft-close drive which is used 
to monitor its proper functioning. 

Closing the trunk places the rotary striker in the trunk lock in the pre-locking position. To 
this end, a microswitch is located in the trunk lock which changes status when the lock is 
actuated. 

The electronics module in the automatic soft-close drive evaluates this change in status 
and triggers the drive to switch on. The automatic soft-close drive is actuated until the 
rotary striker is located in the main locking position. Once this has occurred, the 
microswitch changes status again and the drive is switched off. 

Note: The drive and the trunk lock can be replaced individually. 

Fuel filler flap central locking drive 

The central locking drive is eguipped with a motor for unlocking/locking. 

Manually releasing the fuel filler flap 

The fuel filler flap can be released manually in the event of an electrical defect. The 
release mechanism is located in the luggage compartment, on the right-hand side. 


24 

F01 Central Locking System
