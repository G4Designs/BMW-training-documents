Introduction 


The New Flagship 

As ever, developing a new 7 Series is a special challenge because this vehicle repre¬ 
sents the pinnacle of technical achievement and, in this class, the demands placed on a 
wide variety of gualities are particularly high. During this development, we were faced 
with having to outdo not only the competition but also an excellent predecessor. 



The drive train was particularly challenging in this respect. Here, superior dynamics meet 
ultra-smooth performance, increasingly, however, fuel economy is also playing an ever 
more important role. And this is exactly where the “Efficient Dynamics” development 
strategy comes in. It combines improved driving performance with reduced fuel con¬ 
sumption. 

The F01/F02 sets new standards in all of these areas. “Efficient Dynamics” is a strategy 
that aims not to find a compromise, but to achieve the best of all worlds.

Modifications as compared to the predecessor 

This document describes the modifications to the F01 drive train by comparison with its 
predecessor, the E65. New or modified systems and components are also explained. 

The following table shows an overview of the changes/modifications relative to the E65. 
Their descriptions are distinguished by various categories: 

• New development denotes a new technology that has never before been used at 
BMW. 

• Change denotes a component that was specifically developed for the F01 engine 
but does not represent a technological innovation. 

• Carry-over denotes a component already fitted in other BMW models

N63B44O0 engine 




The N63 engine fitted to the E71 has now been carried over to 
the F01/F02. Only the intake air duct and the exhaust system are 
vehicle-specific, and the engine management is now connected 
to the FlexRay. 

Fuel preparation 




Fuel preparation has been further improved in the area of the 
breather system. At the same time, the security against escap¬ 
ing fuel or fuel vapors has been further increased. 

Automatic transmission 




The 6HPTU has been carried over from the E70. On the 

F01/F02, too, the transmission is now controlled using the gear 
selector switch also adopted from the E70. 

Rear axle differential 




The F01/F02 are equipped with new final drives. It is the first 
time that BMW has fitted rear differentials having an aluminum 
casing. They have also been optimized for low-friction operation. 

Shafts 




The propeller shaft has a push-fit connection to the rear axle dif¬ 
ferential as it does on the E70. For the first time, this connection 
has a flexible coupling. The drive shafts have a push-fit connec¬ 
tion at both the differential end and at the wheel end. Both hol¬ 
low and solid shafts are used.

F01 Powertrain 



















N63B44O0 Engine 


The 750i/Li also underwent a series of downsizing measures, although its increased 
power output is more immediately obvious than its reduced engine capacity. 

The N63 engine makes use of the same technology for mixture preparation as the N54 
engine, i.e. twin-turbochargers and High Precision Injection (HPI) operating permanently 
in homogenous mode. 

The engine is relatively new to the market. It was introduced in May 2008 under the 
hood of the X6 xDrive50i, where it would deliver breathtaking performance.

F01 Powertrain 





The N63 engine’s most extraordinary feature has to be the location of its turbochargers - 
in the engine valley - hence the arrangement of the cylinder heads where the hot exhaust 
side is turned inwards. It is the first automobile gasoline engine in the world to have such 
an arrangement. 

By positioning the turbochargers and the catalytic converters in the engine valley, it was 
possible to make optimum use of this space to bring essential turbocharging compo¬ 
nents together. 

Conseguently, only the relatively small intake manifolds (due to turbocharging) are present 
on the outside of the engine. This enables the engine to be integrated into a range of 
different vehicle and drive train concepts without any major modifications being reguired. 

Particular challenges are faced, however, in the cooling system and charge-air line. 

Vehicle-specific Modifications 

The N63 is a relatively new engine. For use in the F01/F02, hardly any modifications were 
reguired. 

The following components were adapted: 

• Oil sump 

• Intake air duct 

• Exhaust system 

• Cooling system 

• Engine electrical system.

Air Intake and Exhaust System 

Intake Air Duct 

The intake air duct in the F01/F02 differs negligibly from that of the E71. In the interests 
of space-saving, the unfiltered air duct has been relocated. Now air is taken in from the 
side of the BMW kidney grille. Also evident is the one resonator on each of the two unfil¬ 
tered air pipes. The upper section of the intake silencer has also undergone a vehicle- 
specific modification.

Exhaust System 

When designing the dual outlet exhaust system in the underbody area, our development 
engineers focused on achieving optimum pipe routing and the optimum pipe diameter. 

The design of the silencers meets the high demands for low noise levels in this vehicle 
class. Jutting out of each of the two rear silencers are two tailpipes, each of which 
contains an exhaust flap. The exhaust flaps are map-controlled by the DME, making it 
possible to achieve the sound behavior you would expect from the vehicle.

With the E71, this was characterized by high load feedback, i.e. a powerful V8 sound 
under acceleration, settling down to a more comfortable noise level during constant 
speed travel. In the tuning of the F01/F02, we accomplished a V8 sound that meets the 
high demands for comfort in this vehicle class. 

The F01/F02 fully complies with the ULEV II emission standards. Connected down¬ 
stream of the turbochargers are the near-engine catalytic converters. The exhaust 
system is dual pipe design throughout. There are two front silencers, one center silencer 
and two rear silencers. 

The four tailpipes project into two chrome trims integrated into the rear apron.

Cooling System 


In principle, the complex cooling system of the N63 engine is a carry-over from the E71. 
Nevertheless, there are a few differences: 

• no separate auxiliary coolant radiator 

• engine oil radiator to the front of the left-side wheel housing 

• there is an additional engine oil radiator to the front of the right-side wheel housing 

• liguid-cooled engine control module.

For the most part, the layout of the N63 engine cooling circuit in the F01/F02 corre¬ 
sponds to that of the E71. The only obvious difference is that no auxiliary coolant radiator 
is used in the F01/F02. This is made possible by the use of high-performance coolant 
radiators. These also have a more compact height, which is essential when it comes to 
pedestrian safety. 

As usual, the coolant radiator has an integrated low-temperature section for transmission 
cooling. Thanks to the on-demand control of the electric fan, the characteristic map 
thermostat and the electric auxiliary coolant pump, we were able to realize a thermal 
management system that yields benefits in terms of fuel economy, comfort and power 
output. 

The entire cooling module and the engine oil radiator and its lines are decoupled from 
the body in order to optimize sound characteristics in the passenger compartment.

As it did in the E71, the turbocharged N63 engine operates with an indirect form of 
charge air cooling. Heat from the charge air is transferred to the coolant, then the hot 
coolant radiates heat into the ambient air. There is a dedicated coolant circuit for this 
function. In the F01/F02, the cooling for the DME is also integrated into this coolant 
circuit. For the first time at BMW, the engine control unit is liquid-cooled.

Engine Control Unit 

In the F01/F02, too, the N63 engine is controlled by the MSD85 as is the case in the 
E71. This control unit has been modified to make it compatible with the FlexRay used in 
the F01/F02. 

As with the other engine variants, the control unit is located to the front of the right-side 
spring strut dome. By contrast with the other two engine variants, however, this control 
unit is liguid-cooled rather than air-cooled.

Fuel Supply System 


Due to the nature of the installation space in the vehicle, the fuel tank is divided into two 
chambers. The fuel supply system has two delivery units that are accommodated in the 
right and left fuel tank halves. 

In the event of the surge chamber being completely empty, initial fill valve (1) enables 
fuel to enter the surge chamber during the refueling process.

Fuel passes through suction strainer (2) and enters fuel pump (3) and is then pumped to 
feed line (9) through fuel filter (4). The fuel pump resides in the surge chamber. 

A pressure limiting valve (8) is integrated into the feed line in the fuel tank. 

For the first time for a gasoline engine, we are no longer using a pressure regulator. 
Instead, operation of the electric fuel pump is pressure-regulated. In response to the 
signal from the low-pressure fuel sensor, the speed of the electric fuel pump is adjusted 
to achieve the desired delivery pressure upstream of the high-pressure pump. 

A further line branches off downstream of the fuel pump into the left half of the fuel tank 
and carries fuel from the left half into the surge chamber by way of a non-return valve (5) 
and suction jet pump (6).

The non-return valve (5) prevents fuel from flowing back from the right half to the left half 
of the fuel tank while the engine is switched off. 

When you switch off the engine, the feed line is depressurized but cannot run dry 
because, with the system being airtight, no air is able to enter the line. Anti-leak valve (7) 
prevents the fuel tank from leaking in the event of damage to the lines on the engine or 
underbody. 

A further line en route to the left half of the fuel tank branches off to another suction jet 
pump (11), which sucks fuel out of the fuel trap and delivers it to the surge chamber. 

Another line exits the pump carrying fuel pumped from the fuel tank to the surge 
chamber by suction jet pump (10).

Fuel filler cap (A) has an integral pressure relief valve (B) to the protect fuel tank (E) from 
excess pressure. At the end of the fuel filler neck, there is a non-return flap with a pres¬ 
sure relief valve (C). The non-return flap prevents fuel from sloshing back into the fuel 
filler neck. The non-return flap is sealed closed by a spring. In the event of a build-up of 
pressure in the fuel tank, the pressure relief valve in the non-return flap ensures that the 
excess pressure can escape through the fuel filler pipe and out of the fuel filler cap 
through the pressure relief valve. 

The components in the fuel tank are accessible through the service cover (F). The fuel 
level is detected by the two lever-type sensors (G). 

The surge chamber (D) ensures that the fuel pump never pumps dry. The surge 
chamber is permanently connected to the fuel tank and cannot be replaced separately. 

The F01/F02 has a whole range of breather valves in the fuel tank. In principle, all of 
these valves fulfil the breather function, both during vehicle operation and during 
refueling. 

Despite this, they are named to reflect their main purpose. They are therefore divided 
into filler valves and service breather valves. The service breather valves have a smaller 
opening, which means that, during refueling, they alone would not be able to let air 
escape from the fuel tank fast enough. There are service breather valves with and without 
over fueling protection. 

The service breather valves are arranged in such a way that air can still be released even 
if the vehicle is parked up on one side. 

The filler breather valve is located at a high position. If the fuel level rises to this height 
during refueling, the valve closes. Air can no longer escape from the fuel tank fast 
enough, which causes fuel to rise up the filler pipe and switch off the fuel nozzle. 

To enable the release of air to continue, there is a service breather valve located at the 
highest point. However, the presence of the valve in this location means that the fuel tank 
could be overfilled in the event of persistent refueling. Conseguently, fuel would enter the 
activated charcoal filter and ultimately flow back out of the opening. To prevent this, the 
highest service breather valve is eguipped with over fueling protection like the one on the 
left-hand side of the vehicle (as a safeguard if the vehicle were parked up on one side). 

Fuel that is carried along with the release of air is collected in a fuel trap and pumped 
back into the surge chamber.

Fuel filler pipe 


The non-return flap forms a tight seal. A force of approximately 0.15 N is required to 
open the non-return flap. This force is slightly exceeded during any type of refueling. 

The non-return flap on the F01 is equipped with a pressure relief valve. The purpose of 
this pressure relief valve is to prevent excessive pressures from building up in the fuel 
tank. If the pressure in the fuel tank rises to over 150 mbar, the pressure relief valve 
opens and the pressure is able to escape through the fuel filler pipe and the breather 
line/pressure relief valve in the fuel cap. 

The pressure relief valve in the non-return flap on the F01 is a new concept because the 
breather line is not protected by the body along its entire length. In the event of an acci¬ 
dent, therefore, the breather line could be squeezed closed. 

Filler Breather Valve 

The filler breather valve has several functions. As the name suggests, the valve fulfils the 
filler-neck breather function. In addition, however, it also performs the service breather 
function It also has a rollover function. 

The filler breather valve is notable for its large opening, which allows air to escape rapidly 
from the tank during refueling. If, during refueling, the float of the filler breather valve 
ascends with the rising fuel level and thereby closes the breather hole, fuel will rise up the 
fuel filler pipe and switch off the fuel nozzle. 

During vehicle operation, the pressure in the fuel system can rise as a result of the 
increase in temperature. This pressure is allowed to escape through the filler and service 
breather valve and the fuel trap. Fuel that is carried along in the process is collected in the 
fuel trap and sucked back while the fuel pump is in operation.

The service breather valve with over fueling protection is responsible for the release of air 
during vehicle operation. It also has a roll-over function. 

A feature worth noting is the integrated over fueling protection. The service breather 
valve with over fueling protection is fitted with a plate that seals the breather hole under 
its own weight. During refueling, this plate is lifted by the build-up of excess pressure in 
the fuel tank and the resultant flow of air, and the filler breather valve is then able to fulfil 
the purpose for which it was designed.

If the float of the filler breather valve now ascends with the rising fuel level and thereby 
closes the breather hole, fuel will rise up the fuel filler pipe and switch off the fuel nozzle. 

As soon as the fuel in the tank settles down, the fuel level drops slightly and the float no 
longer obstructs the filler breather hole. It would now be possible to refuel a little more. 
This refueling needs to be prevented, which is where the plate plays its part. As refueling 
involves only a low volumetric flow of fuel, the plate’s opening pressure is not reached, so 
no air can escape, the fuel level in the fuel filler pipe rises again and the fuel nozzle 
switches off again. 

During vehicle operation, the pressure in the fuel system can rise as a result of the 
increase in temperature. If the pressure in the complete fuel tank (fuel level above service 
breather valves) rises approximately 55 mbar above atmospheric pressure, the plate is lift¬ 
ed and the pressure can escape through the fuel trap. Fuel that is carried along in the 
process is collected in the fuel trap and sucked back while the fuel pump is in operation. 

In this way, air can still be released even if the fuel tank is full with no risk of over fueling.

The service breather valve without over fueling protection is responsible for the release of 
air during vehicle operation. It also has a roll-over function. 

The service breather valve without over fueling protection also makes it possible for air to 
enter the fuel tank. 

During refueling, the rising fuel level lifts the float of the filler breather valve, which seals 
the breather hole. The fuel nozzle does not switch off, however, because there are other 
breather valves located higher up the fuel tank.

Fuel Trap 

With the fuel tank full, the fuel trap is located below the fuel level. The service breather 
valve and filler breather valve may inevitably allow some fuel to enter the fuel tank breather 
system. This fuel is captured by the fuel trap at the lowermost point of the fuel tank 
breather system. From here, it is sucked up by a suction jet pump fitted near the fuel 
pump and pumped back into the surge chamber. As a result, no air is able to leak out of 
the vehicle, even if the vehicle were to overturn. 

Afloat in the fuel trap prevents fuel from entering the liquid trap through the return line 
when the fuel level is high. The float is designed to also act like a roll-over valve, sealing 
the fuel tank from the breather line in the event of the vehicle overturning.

Fuel Pump 

The electric fuel pump (EKP) is controlled by the EKP control unit by means of a PWM 
signal. The EKP control unit in turns receives a request from the ECM (DME). 

This request used to be based on load and engine speed. Now the regulation is 
pressure-sensitive. For this purpose, a fuel pressure sensor is fitted to the fuel line 
directly upstream of the high-pressure pump. 

This allows the electric fuel pump to be controlled on demand. This reduces the energy 
consumption of the fuel pump, which improves fuel economy. 

Pressure Limiting Valve 

The pressure limiting valve is connected to ground by the plug-in contacts on the service 
cover. This prevents electrostatic charge on the valve. 

The pressure limiting valve keeps fuel pressures in the feed section lower than to a maxi¬ 
mum of 5.8 bar (approximate). 

This prevents excess pressures from building up in the feed line. Excess pressures would 
otherwise occur if the fuel filter were to become blocked, which would place the feed 
section of the fuel system under unnecessarily heavy loads.

Automatic Transmission 


The F01/F02 is available exclusively with an automatic transmission. The transmission is 
GA6FIP26TU that was introduced with the E70 and was subsequently fitted in many 
model series since. 

GA6HP26TU 





The basic transmission (GA6FIP26) was introduced with the E65/E66. Even then, they 
featured an electronic gearshift. The F01/F02 has an electronic gearshift as well, but the 
gear selector switch has been relocated to the center console, as it is in the E70/E71 or 
E60/E61 LCI.

Gear Selector Switch 

The gear selector switch on the F01/F02 has been carried over from the E6x and E7x. 

In both automatic and manual mode, operation of the switch is monostable, in other 
words, the selector lever always returns to its original position. 

The gear selector switch also contains the control unit (GWS), which is connected to the 
electric gearshift controller by the PT-CAN like it was before. The second, redundant 
connection, however, is no longer connected by the LIN bus as used to be the case, but 
by the new PT-CAN 2. 



Emergency release of the F01/F02 automatic transmission 


Emergency Release 

As you would expect, the F01/F02 has an emergency release for the automatic transmis¬ 
sion. This functions in much the same way as that of the E70. The emergency release is 
located under the ashtray to the front of the gear selector switch.

Rear Axle Differential 


The key aim in the development of the final drive in the F01/F02 was to make consider¬ 
able savings on weight at the same time as increasing the maximum torque transmission 
capacity. 

In addition, efficiency was further improved by efforts to achieve optimum spline geome¬ 
tries. The result is a new generation of final drives, which are also notable for their new 
aluminum casing. These differentials are recognizable by the letters “AL” in their 
designation (A = aluminum casing, L = low-friction). 

The new differential in the F01/02 is designated “225 AL” and weighs approximately 
29.7 kilograms (approximately 65 lbs.) 

Thanks to cutting edge development methods, a differential casing was made of 
aluminum for the first time. This has helped to achieve a weight reduction of approxi¬ 
mately 15 % compared with previous differentials. 

To satisfy the high demand for low noise levels in this vehicle class, a comprehensive 
range of decoupling measures were required on the vehicle. Through the use of efficient 
bearings, optimum spline geometries in the oil circuit and an optimum oil volume in the 
differential, it was possible to reduce friction losses and churning losses and to thereby 
increase efficiency even further. Together with better heat dissipation, this has con¬ 
tributed to lower oil temperatures.

Driveshaft 

For the F01/02 the driveshaft is made from steel and designed meet the higher torque 
requirements. 

In addition to torque transfer, key aims in the designing of the driveshaft for the F01/ F02 
were to satisfy demands for comfort in terms of noise and vibration. 

The joints, shaft junctions and shaft diameters were designed in such a way that no 
disturbance noise or vibrations at the connecting points are transmitted through the body. 

On the F01/F02, the driveshaft is connected to the automatic transmission and rear axle 
differential exclusively by flexible couplings. This minimizes high-frequency gear teeth 
noise at the rear axle differential. 

The connection to the automatic transmission is a screw-fitted one. At the rear axle 
differential end, it is push-fitted as it is on the E70. However, this is the first time that a 
push-fit connection with flexible coupling has been used. The center connection is a 
slide piece connection with universal joint. 

The driveshaft absorbs some of the impact energy in the event of a head-on collision. 
Improvements have been made to the properties of this crash function, which is integrat¬ 
ed into the forward driveshaft tube. The compression force under which the forward 
driveshaft tube is meant to deform has been further reduced with no effect on torque 
transfer capability. 

Despite increased demands in terms of torque and comfort, it was possible to reduce 
weight by comparison with the predecessor model. 

Axle Shafts 

The F01/F02 has axle shafts that are push-fit at each end, i.e. wheel end and differential 
end. The axle shafts for the N63 engine on the F01 are solid. 

The journal at the rear axle differential end depends on the size of the rear axle differen¬ 
tial. The journal at the wheel hub end comes in only the one size. 

Due to the position of the rear axle differential, the drive shafts on the left and right have a 
different overall length.
