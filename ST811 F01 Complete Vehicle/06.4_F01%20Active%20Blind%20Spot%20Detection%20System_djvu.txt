F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 


Introduction 


Active Blind Spot Detection is a new BMW system. It is being introduced for the first 
time in the F01/F02 7 Series . The system is designed to assist the driver in making lane 
change maneuvers by monitoring traffic at the rear and sides of the vehicle. Using two 
radar sensors it detects vehicles traveling in the rear and along side our vehicle and 
warns the driver of the position of any unseen vehicles around him traveling in his 
“Blind Spot”.

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 




















The active blind spot detection system can detect traffic situations that could be 
dangerous if your vehicle changes lanes. The driver is informed and warned in two 
stages. 

These kinds of traffic scenarios arise, for example, when distant vehicles rapidly approach 
from behind. They are then in the "lane change zone" shown in the graphic. 

These kinds of situations are difficult for the driver to judge, especially after dark. The 
radar sensors work completely independently of the light conditions. 

A second danger can arise if other vehicles are in the blind spot area. The driver can only 
be aware of them if he is particularly careful and cautious. However, If he has a lapse of 
attention, he may not see vehicles in this area. 

The radar sensors of the active blind spot detection system detect other vehicles in the 
neighboring lanes right up to about the middle of your own vehicle. The system can 
therefore offer the driver valuable assistance in this situation as well. 

The first stage of detection is called "information" and it is provided as soon as the sys¬ 
tem is switched on and a hazardous lane change situation is present. The information is 
provided by activating warning lights in the door mirrors. 

If the driver intends to make a lane change and uses the turn signal stalk to indicate this, 
a second, more intense stage will then be issued, the "warning". 

The corresponding warning light then flashes with high intensity and the steering wheel 
starts to vibrate. The driver must cancel the lane change and if necessary steer back into 
his own lane to avoid a dangerous situation. 


Note: The US marketing term for Lane Change Warning System (SWW) is 

Active Blind Spot Detection. These two systems are one and the same 
and are not to be confused with Lane Departure Warning.

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 


























Detecting Road Users 

Both (master and SWW2) radar sensors are used to detect road users. They operate 
independently of each other in their own respective areas of detection. 

First, the position of the road users who have been detected is determined in a 
longitudinal and lateral direction. Based on this, they are assigned a lane. In doing so a 
distinction is made between your own lane, the neighboring lanes on the right and left 
and other neighboring lanes that are further away. 

if road users are in your "lane change zone", their approaching speeds to your own 
vehicle are recorded. 

If, instead, a road user is in your blind spot, it is sufficient that you are aware of their 
presence. His exact position or speed in such cases is not critical for the warning to be 
issued. 

Setting the Necessity for a Warning 

The necessity for a warning is determined by the master radar sensor (SWW). To do 
this, it uses the data which it has collected about road users itself, as well as information 
from the SWW2 radar sensor. 

For the blind spot detection system, only the road users on the immediately neighboring 
lanes on both sides are relevant. In contrast, road users in your own lane and on other 
more distant lanes do not pose a danger when you are making a lane change. 

The distance and approaching speed of road users in your lane change zone, i.e. of 
vehicles immediately behind your own vehicle, is a decisive factor as to whether a warning 
is issued or not. The time remaining for cancelling a lane change maneuver is calculated 
using the distance (in a longitudinal direction) and their approaching speed. If this time 
drops below a threshold value for any one of the detected road users, the system decides 
that it is necessary to give a warning. 

Road users in the blind spot lead to a minimal amount of time being calculated for 
cancelling a lane change. This is why their exact position or speed relative to your own 
vehicle only has secondary importance. The mere presence of a road user in the blind 
spot therefore leads to the necessity for a warning. 


12 

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 



The blind spot detection system must, of course, also be able to detect transitions from 
the lane change zone into the area of the blind spot and vice versa. A further challenge 
for the system is to determine the beginning and the end of the warning necessity when 
a vehicle in the neighboring lane is slowly overtaken by your own vehicle. 

Vehicles that are overtaken very guickly cause the necessity for a warning to be 
suppressed or at least to end guickly. 

In order to depict what the system is doing as reliably as possible to the driver, more than 
just the current measured values from the radar sensors are used, in particular in these 
special situations. In addition, the position and speed history of the other road users is 
taken into account. For example, based on a mathematical model, the system determines 
the point when an overtaking vehicle leaves the blind spot area and no longer poses a 
danger. 

The master-radar sensor sends the result of the calculation as to whether the necessity 
for a warning is present or not, to the ICM control unit. 

Switching the System On and Off 

How the Active Blind Spot Detection system behaves with regard to the driver is ulti¬ 
mately controlled by the Integrated Chassis Management. 

This includes: 

• Switching it on and off 

• Checking the operating conditions 

• Checking for faults 

• Distinguishing between information and a warning. 

A button on the operating unit for the driver assistance systems is used to switch it on 
and off. The ICM control unit receives the signal by keystroke from the footwell module. 

The ICM control unit permits it to be switched on only if no fault is present in the inter¬ 
connected system and all operating conditions are satisfied. 

If the ICM control unit carries out the driver's reguest to switch it on, the function 
illumination on the button is switched on as visual feedback. This is also controlled 
by the Integrated Chassis Management and is executed by the FRM. 


13 

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 



If the request to switch it on cannot be carried out, the function illumination remains off. 
The status (switched on or off) remains key specific regardless of power cycles. If the 
Active Blind Spot Detection system is on in the current driving cycle, it will be on in the 
next driving cycle from the start. 

If, after switching on the Active Blind Spot Detection, one of the operating conditions is 
infringed or a fault occurs, it is automatically deactivated. In such a case, the driver would 
not be able to tell if only the function illumination had switched off. Therefore, a Check 
Control message is issued (see the section entitled "system components"). 

Informing and Warning 

The system can only generate information or a warning reliably, if the road speed is 
greater than 50 km/h (31 mph). The function will work at speeds under 50 km/h (31 
mph), but not with the high quality and reliability required by BMW. In order not to com¬ 
promise on the satisfaction of discerning BMW customers, no information or warnings 
are issued at speeds below 50 km/h (31 mph). 

Information is the first stage of assistance that the driver receives from the Active Blind 
Spot Detection system. The idea is to discreetly make the driver aware of a danger that 
could arise if he were to change lanes. Information is produced by discreetly illuminating 
a yellow triangle-shaped warning light in the housing of the door mirror. The warning light 
is only activated on the side of the vehicle where the necessity for a warning has been 
detected by the master radar sensor. 

Thanks to this concept, the system provides assistance to the driver as early as the 
preparation phase of a lane change maneuver. The driver can glance briefly in the 
direction of the door mirror at any to collect information from the Active Blind Spot 
Detection system as to whether or not a danger exists regarding a lane change. 

The discreet manner of the information, on the other hand, does not cause annoyance if 
the driver wishes to continue to drive straight ahead without making a lane change. 

The ICM control unit sends a bus signal that contains a warning request indicating in 
which door mirror the warning light should light up and with which intensity. In the 
process, the ICM control unit selects an intensity that is dependent on the surrounding 
brightness. To do this, it reads a bus signal from the rain/ lights/solar/condensation sensor 
and evaluates it. 

The warning request from the ICM control unit travels via the central gateway module to 
the footwell module, where the signal is routed to the door mirror(s) concerned. 


14 

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 



The information is issued to the driver in all cases where all of the following conditions 
have been satisfied: 

• The Active Blind Spot Detection system is switched on 

• The road speed is above 50 km/h (31 mph) 

• The master radar sensor has detected a necessity for a warning. 

The second stage, the warning, should, in comparison, be significantly more prominent 
than the information. It should reach the driver guickly and directly, if he is still intending to 
make a lane change despite an impending dangerous situation. 

The warning is issued, if the following conditions have been satisfied 

• The conditions for information have been satisfied: 

• The turn signal is switched on the side of the vehicle where the master radar sensor 
detected a necessity for a warning. 

The steering column switch cluster issues the signal about the status of the turn signal 
via the FlexRay to the ICM control unit. 

The only difference in the criteria for information and a warning is thus the status of the 
turn signal. The rear traffic situation or your own driving conditions do not influence it. 

The visual aspect of the warning is generated by the respective warning light flashing with 
a high light intensity. In addition, the steering wheel begins to vibrate and this produces a 
haptic and very direct warning signal to the driver. 

Note: If the driver changes lanes without using the turn signal, he will only 

receive the information discreetly from the Active Blind Spot Detection 
system. The Active Blind Spot Detection system only sends out the more 
intensive warning, if the driver has switched on the turn signal when he 
intends to make a lane change. 


Coordinating the Activation of the Vibration Actuator 

Like the blind spot detection, the lane departure warning (KAFAS control unit) also uses 
the vibration actuator to produce a warning signal for the driver. For this, the systems use 
different amplitudes of vibration. 

This is why these must be a coordinator function for controlling the vibration actuator. 
This is integrated into the ICM control unit. 

Using the FlexRay bus system, the coordinated setpoint for the vibration is 
communicated to the steering column switch cluster and executed via the steering 
wheel module (LRE) and the vibration actuator in the steering wheel.

Blind Spot Detection from the Customer’s Perspective 

In this section, example situations are used to explain how the Active Blind Spot 
Detection system behaves in different traffic scenarios. The emphasis here is not on the 
technology, but rather on how the customer perceives the system. In all example situa¬ 
tions it is assumed that the driver has switched on the Active Blind Spot Detection sys¬ 
tem and that the road speed of your own vehicle is above 50 km/h (31 mph).

No Necessity for a Warning 

Although another vehicle in the left-hand lane is approaching your own vehicle, neither 
information or a warning is generated. Even if the driver were to carry out a lane change 
with his own vehicle, this would not result in a dangerous situation. The time it would take 
for the other vehicle to reach your own vehicle is considerable. 

A sufficient distance will be maintained by accelerating your own vehicle slightly or by a 
slight deceleration of the other vehicle. There is no necessity at all for the driver to be 
informed by the Active Blind Spot Detection system.

The vehicle in the left-hand neighboring lane is already in the lane change zone. Because 
it is still approaching your own vehicle at a high speed, the time the driver would have to 
cancel a lane change maneuver is short. The blind spot detection system detects the 
necessity for a warning. Because the driver in his own vehicle does not show any specific 
intention of making a lane change, only the information and not the warning is issued. 

The vehicle in the right-side neighboring lane is at a some what shorter distance from 
your own vehicle than the vehicle in the left side neighboring lane. It is travelling at the 
same speed as your own vehicle. The distance to your own vehicle is therefore not 
decreasing. Thus, there is no necessity for a warning on the right-hand side. 

Only the warning light in the driver's door mirror lights up and it does this with 
low intensity.

The vehicle in the left-hand neighboring lane is in the lane change zone and is 
approaching your own vehicle. There is a necessity for a warning therefore on the left- 
hand side. 

Because the driver intends to make a lane change to the left, he has switched on the left 
turn signal. A lane change maneuver is therefore imminent. In order to attract the 
attention of the driver guickly and directly, a left-side warning is produced. This means 
the warning light in the driver's door mirror flashes brightly and in addition the steering 
wheel vibrates. 

The vehicle in the right-side neighboring lane is also approaching your own vehicle at this 
point. Therefore, the necessity for a warning also exists on the right-hand side. However, 
because the driver has not switched on the right turn signal, information is issued to this 
side, but no warning.

Both the vehicle in the left-hand and the vehicle in the right-side neighboring lanes are in 
the blind spot area. Therefore, the necessity for a warning exists on both sides, indepen¬ 
dently of how quickly they are travelling. 

The driver intends to make a lane change to the right and therefore switches on the right 
turn signal. This causes the right-side warning to be produced. The warning light in the 
front passenger door mirror flashes brightly and the steering wheel vibrates. 

Information is issued on the left-hand side, but no warning.

System Components 


Radar Sensors 

Two radar sensors are fitted in the vehicle for the Active Blind Spot Detection system. 
The two parts are different, although visually they look the same. 

There is a master sensor that is always fitted in the rear of the vehicle on the right-hand 
side, as well as a SWW2 that is fitted in the rear left-hand side. 

The identical features of the master and SWW2 will be introduced first. Then the special 
features and differences between the master and SWW2 will be described. 

Common Features of the Master and SWW2 

The sensors of the Active Blind Spot Detection system work according to the RADAR 
principle (radio detection and ranging). They have some features in common, but also 
some differences in comparison with the short-range radar sensors for the ACC Stop & 
Go function. These are listed in the following table.

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 







































The RADAR principle offers basic advantages with regard to the detection reliability of 
road users in poor weather conditions. Only when it is exposed to extreme conditions, for 
example heavy rain or snow, can a reduction in its range occur. If the sensors detect a 
particularly extreme situation, this status is signalled, so that the function can be switched 
off and the driver informed. 

Both sensors have the functionality of control units. This means that they are compatible 
with diagnostics and can be programmed and coded. 

The sensors are fitted in the rear of the vehicle above the bumper bracket. They are fitted 
to a large plastic component that is referred to as the "center guide". From the outside 
the sensors are not visible, because they are hidden by the bumper trim.

As you can see from the graphic, the detection zones of the two sensors overlap. The 
data on road users that have been detected can therefore not be evaluated separately 
from each other (for the left and right side of the vehicle). Instead the data is first collected 
from both sensors and evaluated. Then a decision is made whether the driver must be 
warned or not. 

A detailed view of the installation locations of the master and SWW2 can be seen in the 
following:

The fixtures for the sensors do not permit any mechanical adjustment. Instead of the sen¬ 
sors being mechanically adjusted (as is the case with the long-range area sensor in the 
ACC), they are calibrated using software. When this is done, the actual installation posi¬ 
tion and above all the alignment of the center axes of the sensors are determined and 
stored in the sensors. For details please see the section entitled "Calibrating the radar 
sensors".

Radar sensor shield

Bracket for shielding

Deformation element 


Two brackets are fitted to the deformation element of the rear bumper that act as a shield 
for the radar sensors. This prevents malfunctions when processing radar signals that 
could be caused, for example, by reflections from the road surface. The material used for 
the bracket was specially selected for this intended use. Therefore, in the event of dam¬ 
age to the brackets, they must be replaced with the correct new part. 

Emergency repair using a different plastic part is not permitted. Both radar sensors have a 
similar structure. The connector and the electronics board are located on the lower sec¬ 
tion of housing. It is used both for electrical shielding and for dissipating heat. 

The board always has a signal processor. This evaluates the radar signals and uses them 
to generate a list of the objects detected by the sensor. The list contains the distance to 
each object in a longitudinal and lateral direction and the relative speed. In addition, infor¬ 
mation is supplied about whether the object is in the blind spot area. 

The radar front-end (radome) is used to generate and send radar waves. Of course, the 
receive circuit is also integrated in it. Sending and receiving is carried out via a planar 
antenna. The radar waves are transformed into the reguired shape using the so-called 
radome. 


24 

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 











The plastic radome therefore determines exactly the extent of the detection zone of the 
sensors. The bumper trim also influences the shape of the detection zone. Calibration 
must therefore always be done with the bumper trim mounted. If done without the 
bumper trim, different values are assigned to the measured distances. The measuring 
result would be distorted and the warning for the driver inappropriate. 

The radome and the lower section of housing are cemented together. Repairs to the 
inside of the sensor are not intended. If the test plan of the diagnostic system reguests it, 
then the sensor must be merely replaced in its entirety.

On one side of the lower section of housing, there is an element for producing pressure 
compensation both on the master and the SWW2. This element contains a membrane 
with a teflon coating that is permeable to air and moisture. However, water in liquid form 
can not permeate the membrane. Pressure compensation is required, because the sen¬ 
sors heat up considerably during operation as a result of electronic power conversion. 

Both sensors have an identical looking connector. Even the mechanical encoding of the 
connector on both sensors is identical. However, the pins are wired differently for master 
and SWW2. This is why they should only be connected to the intended wiring harness. 

How can you distinguish between master and SWW2 then?

The mounting eyes of the lower housing sections on the master and SWW2 are located 
in different positions. The fixtures for the mounting bolts on the "Center guide" are appro¬ 
priately positioned. This ensures that the master is mounted only on the right and the 
SWW2 on the left. Only after installation is complete is it recommended to connect the 
wiring harness to the sensors. 

You can also differentiate between the sensors by using the part number and by the 
labelling on the lower section of the housing. 

Special Features of the SWW2 Radar Sensor 

The SWW2 only provides information about the road users in its detection zone. This is 
why the SWW2 contains only one signal processor for controlling the radar front-end and 
for evaluating the radar signals. A CAN controller is used to send the data to the master. 

The signal processor is also capable of executing the self-diagnostics of the sensor. If 
SWW2 faults are detected, they are stored in its own EEPROM. They are also transferred 
to the master and stored there in its fault code memory. 

Special Features of the Master Radar Sensor (SWW) 

The master performs the same basic tasks as the SWW2 with regard to recording and 
evaluating data from road users. In addition, the master calculates whether a traffic sce¬ 
nario exists that could be dangerous in the event of a lane change. This calculation is 
based on data about the road users detected and the state of motion of your own vehicle. 
If such a situation is detected, the master sends a corresponding signal via FlexRay to the 
ICM control unit. In addition, the master uses the same path to send signals about the 
status of both sensors, for example to determine whether they are functioning correctly or 
there is a fault. 

The master executes self-diagnostics in the same way as the SWW2. If, in the process, it 
detects a fault within itself or a fault is registered by the SWW2, an entry is made in the 
fault code memory of the master. This makes it possible to read faults with the SWW2 
during servicing, even though the diagnostic system is only communicating with the 
master and as a result is only accessing its fault code memory. 

The master contains in addition to the signal processor a further microprocessor for this 
purpose. This also carries out communication via the FlexRay controller with partner con¬ 
trol units, and with the ICM control unit in particular.

Bus Connections 

The sensors for Active Blind Spot Detection are connected with two bus systems: 

• The master (SWW) is connected to the FlexRay and to the local CAN. 

• The SWW2 radar sensor is only connected with the local CAN. 

The SWW2 uses the local CAN to transmit the data of all of the road users it has detect¬ 
ed to the master. The sensors also utilize the local CAN to exchange internal system sta¬ 
tus and control signals. 

The local CAN is physically set up like the PTCAN and therefore works at a bit rate of 
500 kBit/s. Master and SWW2 each have one of the two terminal resistors, each with 
120 Q. 

The FlexRay represents the interface between the sensors and the whole vehicle. In this 
way, the sensors, or to be exact, the master sensor, receives the data about the state of 
motion of the vehicle (e.g. the road speed and yaw rate). 

The master uses this interface to send information about whether the necessity for a 
warning exists to the ICM control unit. 

The FlexRay is routed to the master and is fitted there with a terminating resistor. The 
master is therefore a terminal node in the FlexRay network. 

A detailed description of new features in the FlexRay network can be found in the F01 / 
F02. bus systems training material in ICP and TIS. 

Voltage Supply 

The SWW sensors are supplied with power via a common fuse with terminal 15. The 
fuse is located in the rear fuse carrier (in the luggage compartment). The voltage supply is 
routed to the master and from there to the SWW2. 

The wake-up line is therefore not reguired on the SWW sensors. 

Note: During the overrun of terminal 15 the SWW sensors save important data 
in the integrated EEPROM. This includes, for example, fault code memo¬ 
ry entries and values calculated during calibration. This data is perma¬ 
nently stored and available again for the next driving cycle. It is therefore 
important to wait for the overrun from terminal 15 when work is carried 
out on the SWW sensors, before disconnecting the voltage supply (con¬ 
nector, battery).

Calibrating the Radar Sensors 

The calibration process is carried out with use of the ISTA diagnostic system. 

Calibration is performed for both sensors of the Active Blind Spot Detection system 
successively. 

Reasons for calibration 

The radar sensors of the Active Blind Spot Detection system measure the position and 
speed of road users approaching from the rear. This measurement is taken by the sensor 
housing as a reference value. In order to make a decision as to whether the driver should 
be warned or not, the measured data must be related to the vehicle's coordinate system. 
For this the exact location of the sensors must be known. 

The installation location of the sensors is principally specified by the position of the 
retaining bore in "center guide". However, the sensor may be incorrectly aligned during 
installation or as a result of the tolerances of supporting parts. This applies in particular 
to the angle formed by the sensor axis and the vehicle longitudinal axis. If the deviation 
between the actual angle and the angle specified in the design is too large, this would 
interfere with the proper functioning of the Active Blind Spot Detection system. Warnings 
would either be omitted or be produced inappropriately. 

The radar sensors must always be calibrated after the following: 

• At least one of the radar sensors has been replaced. 

• The bumper trim has been replaced. 

• Repair work to the supporting parts has been carried out (e.g. to the "center guide"). 

• The test plan of the diagnostic system reguests this due to a fault code memory 
entry. 


Note: For more information regarding the Active Blind Spot Detection radar 
calibration process refer to the ISTA Diagnostic System.

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 



Special Situations and Fault Statuses 

Communication faults and internal control unit faults are not dealt with here in detail. 
Problem resolution is carried out in the same manner as with other control units, i.e. with 
the assistance of the test plan in the diagnostic system. 

Instead, the emphasis here is on the statuses which apply specifically to the radar 
sensors of the Active Blind Spot Detection system. The material presented here should 
facilitate the diagnostics. 

Blindness 

"Blindness" here is used to denote heavy interference with the radar sensors, in which 
they no longer are able, for example, to detect road users at the required range. Blindness 
can also cause incorrect or omitted warnings. 

The radar sensors contain a function which enables it to detect this status during 
operation. In this case, the master sends a bus signal to the ICM and the Active Blind 
Spot Detection system is then deactivated. The driver is informed about this by a Check 
Control message. The blindness status is documented with an entry in the fault code 
memory for a subsequent workshop visit. 

Possible causes of the blindness status are: 

• The sensor is covered by a sticker or by a bicycle carrier at the rear. 

• Deformation (dents) in the bumper trim, even if for instance it has been repaired 
with plastic filler. 

• Incorrect vertical alignment of the sensors (e.g. upwards) through a deformation 
of the supporting parts. 

• Extremely thick covering of snow/slush on the bumper trim. 

Errors in the sensor alignment 

In the radar sensors of the Active Blind Spot Detection system, a function is calcu¬ 
lated that can detect sensor alignment errors when the vehicle is in motion. This 
function monitors the data about detected objects as it is processed. 

If the detected sensor alignment error is within a range that is still tolerable, the function 
compensates for the error. This means the data about the detected road users is correct¬ 
ed by the known value. If a sensor alignment error that is too large is detected, the proper 
functioning of the Active Blind Spot Detection system is no longer possible. The master 
then sends a signal to the ICM and the Active Blind Spot Detection system is switched 
off. The driver is informed about this by a Check Control message. 


31 

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 



Reasons for deactivating the system due to detected sensor alignment errors include: 

• A new radar sensor was installed without being calibrated (detected immediately). 

• The sensor is covered by a sticker or by a bicycle carrier. 

• Mechanical damage to the rear of the vehicle with deformation of the supporting 
parts (e.g. the "Center guide"). 

• Deformation (dents) in the bumper trim, even if for instance it has been repaired with 
plastic filler. 

Some of the reasons given here could also apply to the "blindness" status. 

For example, depending on the extent of the deformation of the bumper trim, 
this can result in blindness. 

This kind of deformation can distort the radar signals in such a way that the sensors 
detect a sensor alignment error. 

Rear damage 

Two kinds of damage are plausible which reguire different repair measures: 

• Damage exclusively to the bumper trim in the area where the sensor is installed. 

• Additional deformation of the bumper bracket or other supporting parts. 

Damage to the bumper trim 

Of course only damage in the area where the radar waves are emitted from the sensors 
are relevant. If the bumper trim is deformed there, scratched extensively or it has an 
uneven thickness due to repairs to the plastic, can interfere with the proper functioning 
of the radar sensors. Bumper stickers placed over the area can also cause radar interfer¬ 
ence. 

These situations may result in a reduced range, the omission of warnings or the incorrect 
production of a warning. 

In the event of this kind of damage, you must ensure that the sensor installed behind the 
bumper trim has not been damaged in anyway. 

The repair entails restoring the original position and the original shape of the bumper trim 
to ensure proper system operation. 


Note: The US marketing term for Lane Change Warning System (SWW) is 

Active Blind Spot Detection. These two systems are one and the same 
and are not to be confused with Lane Departure Warning. 


32 

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 



Damage to supporting parts 

If a supporting part (e.g. the bumper bracket or the trunk trim fitted to the "Center guide") 
is deformed, the sensors for the Active Blind Spot Detection system are probably no 
longer correctly aligned. This leads to the omission of warnings or that warnings are 
incorrectly produced. 

Your first option is to attempt a calibration. To do this, the bumper trim must be mounted. 
If the calibration is performed successfully, the misalignment was so small that it could be 
compensated for in the calibration (using software). 

If the calibration produces a deviation in the sensor alignment that is larger than specified 
by the design, the "center guide" must be correctly realigned. Because the "center 
guide" acts as a carrier for the sensors, aligning the "Center guide" also repositions the 
sensors correctly. This process is described in detail in the Repair Instructions. 

Based on the spacers that act as gauges, the correct alignment can be restored. In any 
case, after this kind of body repair, the sensors will have to be calibrated.

The operating unit for the driver assistance systems is fitted with a button that can switch 
the Active Blind Spot Detection system on and off. 

The operating unit is connected via the LIN bus to the footwell module (FRM). A bus 
signal from the FRM to the ICM is used to inform that the button has been pressed. 

The ICM only permits the Active Blind Spot Detection to be switched on, if the system is 
working faultlessly. Only then does it send a positive response via a bus signal to the 
FRM, to activate the function illumination on the button. 

If instead there is a fault with the system, the function illumination remains off despite 
being pressed. The driver will then know that the system is not available.

Warning Light in the Driver's Door Mirror 

There is a triangular-shaped warning light in the left and right door mirror. This lights up 
two-dimensionally and can be activated in different intensities. 

The ICM sends a reguest together with the reguested intensity to the footwell module. 

Using the LIN bus, the request is passed on to the electrical system of the respective 
door mirrors. Amplitude-modulated control is used to light up the LEDs in the door mirror. 

Vibration Actuator in the Steering Wheel 

The vibration actuator is housed in the six o'clock spoke of the steering wheel. It has the 
task of causing the steering wheel to vibrate. 

The Lane Departure Warning and Active Blind Spot Detection systems use this vibration, 
in order to alert the driver of dangerous situations. In both systems, the warning is execut¬ 
ed by vibrating the steering wheel. 

The steering wheel module that controls the vibration actuator is also housed in the 
interior of the steering wheel. This produces an alternating voltage that causes the 
vibration actuator to oscillate. The frequency of the alternating voltage is not changed 
during operation. It is designed so that oscillations from the vibration actuator fit perfectly 
to the overall steering wheel system. 

The amplitude of the alternating voltage can be changed using the steering wheel 
module. Therefore, you have the option of different systems with varying oscillating 
amplitudes available to you for the warning.

F01 Active Blind Spot Detection System 







The E6x LCI is already equipped with the driver assistance system called lane departure 
warning which has already used steering wheel vibration to warn the driver in a similar 
way. Here a vibration motor is used as the vibration actuator. An unbalance mass is 
located on the shaft. If the vibration motor is activated, the unbalance mass rotates and 
thus produces the vibrations. 

The vibration actuator in the F01/F02 has undergone a significant advancement in 
comparison with the vibration motor. Instead of the unbalance motor, a structural 
element is used that only oscillates in a longitudinal direction. For this reason, it is known 
as a "longitudinal oscillator". This active principle has the advantage that the vibrations are 
only induced in this one direction. The vibration actuator is built into the steering wheel so 
that the direction of its oscillations corresponds with the direction of rotation of the steer¬ 
ing wheel. This provides an ideal expression of the warning and the driver is made imme¬ 
diately aware that he must use the steering wheel to avert the dangerous situation. In 
addition, this principle to a large extent avoids unwanted side-effects such as noises or 
oscillations that could be transferred in other directions to the body. 

The two brackets connect the vibration actuator with the steering wheel. However, the 
brackets on the vibration actuator are not screwed to the case, but to the coil carrier.

This means the coil carrier is fixed in place. The permanent magnet can move instead. It 
is set into an oscillating motion in the direction shown, when alternating voltage is applied 
to the coil. The longitudinal movement of the permanent magnet is transferred to both 
case sections due to its length. This is why the case sections also have a long slot in the 
electrical connection area to the coil. The springs ensure that the case sections do not hit 
against their end positions and therefore prevent noises. 

The reguest to activate the vibration actuator is sent from the Integrated Chassis 
Management over the FlexRay to the steering column switch cluster (SZL). The SZL 
guides this reguest via LIN bus further to the steering wheel module (LRE).

Instrument Cluster 

There are no function displays for the Active Blind Spot Detection system in the instru¬ 
ment cluster (different to the lane departure warning). Instead Check Control messages 
are displayed in the instrument cluster, when the Active Blind Spot Detection system is 
not available. A distinction is made between two possible causes: 




Active Blind Spot Detection deactivated 
(due to functional peripheral factors such 
as, blindness) 


Active Blind Spot Detection failure 
(due to real faults or defects with components)
