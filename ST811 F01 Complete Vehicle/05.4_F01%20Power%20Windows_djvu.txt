The Car Access System (2) issues the enable to actuate the power window motors (5, 7, 

12 and 14). If a power window switch is then activated, the footwell module (1) (front 
power window motor) or the junction box electronics (3) (rear power window motor) exe¬ 
cutes the request. 

Examples of the Signal Path 

The following examples of a signal path show the path taken by the signal before the 
power window motor opens or closes the window. A requirement is that the Car Access 
System 4 has issued the enable to operate the power windows. 

Driver’s Door Switch Cluster 

When the power window switch for the window in the driver’s door or front passenger‘s 
door is operated, the signal is routed via the LIN bus to the footwell module. The footwell 
module drives the corresponding power window motor. 

The signal is routed from the driver’s door switch cluster via the LIN bus to the footwell 
module when the power window switches for the windows in the rear doors are operated. 
The footwell module sends the signal via the K-CAN2 to the junction box electronics. 

The junction box electronics receives the signal and activates the corresponding power 
window motor. 

Power Window Switch, Front Passenger’s Door 

The signal is routed to the junction box electronics when the power window switch in the 
front passenger’s door is operated. 

The junction box electronics sends the signal via the K-CAN2 to the footwell module. 

The footwell module drives the power window motor. 

Power Window Switch, Rear Doors 

When the power window switches in the rear doors are operated, the signal is routed to 
the JBE. The JBE drives the power window motor.

Overview 


All four windows on the F01/F02 are electrically operated. The power windows are 
equipped with an indirect pressure-sensitive finger guard. The electric power windows 
have the following functions: 

• Opening and closing 

• Opening and closing with toll function 

• Auto-remote opening and closing 

• Indirect pressure-sensitive finger guard 

• Panic mode 

• Load shut-down at terminal 50 

• Overheating protection of power window motors. 

Opening and Closing 

The Car Access System 4 has the central control function for electric opening and clos¬ 
ing of the power windows. 

This means that the Car Access System 4 issues the enable to open and close the 
power windows. The footwell module and the junction box electronics actuate the power 
window motors and monitor the motor speed of the respective power window motor. This 
means the footwell module or the junction box electronics can respond to the following 
operating situations: 

• Trapping 

• Overheating of the power window motor 

• Blocking of power window motors. 

The corresponding power window motor is activated in OPEN or CLOSE direction by 
pressing or pulling the power window switches to the first notch position. The power win¬ 
dow motor remains active until the corresponding power window switch is released. 

To ensure the power window is closed reliably, the power window motor is briefly driven 
to block status at the upper stop. 

Opening and Closing with Toll Function 

The toll function is implemented for all power windows. The corresponding power win¬ 
dow motor is driven in the OPEN or CLOSE direction by pressing or pulling a power win¬ 
dow switch beyond the limit stop. 

The power window motor moves the window automatically until it is completely open or 
closed. Power window operation is stopped when the power window switch is pressed or 
pulled again.

By way of example, the opening and closing procedure for one of the rear windows is 
illustrated by the signal path in the following graphic. The opening or closing function is 
initiated from the driver’s door switch cluster.

Auto-remote Opening and Closing 

Auto-remote opening or closing can be performed with the identification transmitter via 
the door lock in the driver’s door or the outside driver’s/passenger’s door handle. 

Auto-remote opening with identification transmitter 

The auto-remote opening function is initiated by unlocking the vehicle with the identifica¬ 
tion transmitter and keeping the button pressed for longer than 5 seconds. 

Initially, the front windows are opened, followed after a short time delay by the rear win¬ 
dows and the panorama glass roof. 

Note: If the fold-in/out exterior mirrors option is installed and the mirrors are 
folded in, the mirrors will be folded out at the same time as the rear win¬ 
dows are opened. 

Only the version sold in Japan offers auto-remote closing or auto¬ 
remote opening for folding the exterior mirrors in or out. 

The signal from the identification transmitter is picked up by the Car Access System 4 via 
the remote control receiver. 

The Car Access System 4 issues the enable to operate the power windows and initiates 
the auto-remote opening function. The footwell module and the junction box electronics 
correspondingly activate the power window motors. 

Auto-remote closing with identification transmitter 

The auto-remote closing function is initiated after locking the vehicle with the identifica¬ 
tion transmitter and keeping the button pressed for longer than 5 seconds. Initially, the 
panorama glass roof is closed followed after a short time delay by the rear/front windows. 

If the folding exterior mirrors option is installed, the mirrors are folded in simultaneously as 
the rear windows are closed. 

Auto-remote opening and closing via the driver’s door lock barrel 

There are two Hall sensors installed in the door lock for the purpose of opening and clos¬ 
ing the vehicle. The Hall sensors enable the footwell module to detect the position of the 
mechanical key or of the spare key in the lock barrel. 

The key must be turned to the open or close position to initiate the auto-remote opening 
and closing function. The auto-remote opening or closing function is initiated when the 
key is held in this position. 

The footwell module sends the reguest via the K-CAN. On conclusion of the correspond¬ 
ing check, the Car Access System 4 initiates the auto-remote opening or closing proce¬ 
dure. 

Auto-remote closing with Comfort Access 

In connection with Comfort Access, the auto-remote closing function is triggered via the 
driver’s/passenger’s outside door handle. 

10 

F01 Power Windows 



It is sufficient to touch the sensitive area of the outside door handle in order to trigger the 
auto-remote closing function via the door handle. Auto-remote closing is triggered if the 
sensitive area is touched for longer than 5 seconds. The ID transmitter must be within an 
approximate 2 m radius of the vehicle. 

Note: Touching the outside door handle corresponds to pressing the lock but¬ 
ton on the ID transmitter. 


Indirect Pressure-sensitive Finger Guard 

Essentially, the indirect pressure-sensitive finger guard does not prevent an object being 
trapped but rather it limits the trapping force to maximum 80 N. The power window motor 
is reversed on exceeding this trapping force. 

The footwell module and the junction box electronics monitor the activated power win¬ 
dow motors. The indirect pressure-sensitive finger guard for the front windows is activat¬ 
ed by the footwell module. The indirect pressure-sensitive finger guard for the rear win¬ 
dows is activated by the junction box electronics. 

The indirect pressure-sensitive finger guard in the E90 is based on the evaluation of the 
Hall pulses from the power window motors. The speed is derived from the Hall pulses of 
the power window motors. Speed fluctuations within certain ranges trigger the indirect 
pressure-sensitive finger guard so that the windows are opened. Operation of the power 
window switches is ineffective while the windows are in the process of opening. 

If no operable pressure-sensitive finger guard is detected as the result of defective Hall 
sensors, the window can only be operated in jolts. The power window is in emergency 
mode and must be reinitialized. 

Note: The initialization procedure is described in the Service Information.

Panic Mode 

Panic mode is triggered by overpulling releasing-overpulling (overpulling = pulling beyond 
limit stop) the power window switches. 

It is necessary to release and overpull the switch again as the pressure-sensitive finger 
guard is still active the first time the switch is overpulled. Overpulling the power window 
switch the second time within 4 seconds closes the window with maximum force. 

Note: The indirect pressure-sensitive finger guard is no longer active in this 
case. The window closes at the maximum closing force and does not 
reverse. 

Load shut-down, Terminal 50 

Car Access System 4 sends the “terminal 50 ON” status. The signal is received by the 
footwell module and junction box electronics via K-CAN. 

The junction box electronics and the footwell module prevent operation of the power win¬ 
dows during the start procedure or interrupt current operation of the power windows. 

This protects the battery during the starting procedure. 

The power window switches must be pressed again following an interruption in opera¬ 
tion. 

Operation of the power windows is not possible until the start procedure has been com¬ 
pleted. 

Overheating Protection of Power Window Motors 

The footwell module and the junction box electronics monitor the motor temperature. 

The motor temperature is determined based on the outside temperature, motor running 
time and the time the motor is stationary (not operative). Each motor can be switched off 
individually to prevent the power window motors overheating during operation of the 
power windows. The motor is then deactivated for a defined period of time. 

The overheating protection facility does not prevent the windows being opened in the 
case of trapping. Once started, a power window function is not interrupted by the over¬ 
heating protection facility. In panic mode the window can still be closed even when the 
overheating protection function is active.

Roller Sun Blind 


Roller sun blinds are available as an option for the rear window and rear side windows. 
The roller sun blinds can be raised and lowered electrically. 

The switch for the roller sun blind on the rear window is located in the driver’s door 
switch cluster. The footwell module detects the switch status via the LIN-bus. When the 
button is pressed, the footwell module issues the operational request via the K-CAN2. 
The complete control and function monitoring facility is integrated in the junction box 
electronics. The junction box electronics therefore executes the operational request. 

Every time the roller sun blinds are operated, their positions are stored in the junction box 
electronics. 

Other operating points are located in the armrests on the rear doors. The switches are 
located next to the switches for the power windows. 

Three switches are provided in each armrest. The switches are: 

• Switch for roller sun blind on rear window 

• Switch for roller sun blind on left side window 

• Switch for roller sun blind on right side window. 

The roller sun blinds can be raised and lowered separately with the switches.

F01 Power Windows 











Each rear door has two roller sun blinds, one for the side window and one for the quarter 
light. 

Both roller sun blinds are raised or lowered by means of an electric motor. 

Note: The roller sun blinds are raised and lowered completely. They cannot be 
raised or lowered to an intermediate position. 

If a new operational request is sent to the roller sun blinds during their actuation, they will 
reverse their direction of movement immediately. 

The enable for operating the roller sun blinds on the rear doors is linked to the closed 
window position. 

The Car Access System issues the enable for operating the roller sun blinds. 

The roller sun blind of the corresponding side window is automatically lowered in 
response to an operational request to open the side window. 

Operation of the roller sun blinds is restricted in the event of undervoltage. 

By monitoring the outside temperature and interior temperature, the function “lower” 
roller sun blind is executed at an interior temperature > 11 °C and outside temperature < - 
16°C. 

The roller sun blinds can be operated as from terminal 15N ON. 

Note: Operation of the roller sun blinds is disabled when the child safety lock 
is activated.

Overview of Functional Principle 

The functional principle of the electrically operated roller sun blinds is described in the 
following. 

Pressure-sensitive Finger Guard for Side Window 

The roller sun blind has no electronic pressure-sensitive finger guard! The mechanism 
and drive units are designed such as to rule out any danger for the occupants posed by 
excessively high forces. 

Nevertheless, to prevent trapping, the roller sun blinds can only be extended when the 
corresponding side window is closed. However should a trapping situation occur, move¬ 
ment of the roller sun blind will be stopped. The roller sun blind is then moved in the 
opposite direction in response to the next operational request. It is always possible to 
retract the roller sun blinds at the side windows. 

The direction of roller sun blind movement that has already started can only be reversed 
1.5 seconds after the button is pressed again. 

Further button operation is ignored during the initial 1.5 seconds of roller sun blind move¬ 
ment. This function is intended to protect the operating mechanism of the roller sun 
blind. 

Roller Sun Blind on Rear Window 

The roller sun blind on the rear window can be operated by means of the roller sun blind 
switches. There are three operating points: 

• Driver’s door switch cluster 

The junction box electronics receives the switch status via the K-CAN2. 

• Switch cluster in rear driver’s side armrest* 

• Switch cluster in rear passenger’s side armrest*. 

*The junction box electronics cyclically evaluates the switches at the rear doors via the LIN-bus. 

The roller sun blind for the rear window is raised or lowered by briefly pressing the switch. 

A special function is activated when the switch for the rear window roller sun blind is 
pressed longer. This special function allows all three roller sun blinds to extend or retract 
to assume the same position. 

In this function, the roller sun blind for the rear window is actuated and, if necessary, also 
the roller sun blinds for the side windows. 

Every time the roller sun blinds are operated, their positions are stored in the junction box 
electronics. 

The end stops are detected by the motors blocking, thus cancelling activation. 


18 

F01 Power Windows 



A repeat inhibit function is integrated in the system to prevent the motor overheating due 
to continuous operational reguests initiated by children playing with the switch. The 
repeat inhibit blocks operation of the roller sun blind in the down position. Once started, 
movement of the roller sun blind is not interrupted by the repeat inhibit. 

The renewed enable to raise the roller sun blind depends on the number of times the 
roller sun blind is operated and the intervals between operation. 


Rearwindow roller sun blind F01/F02 



Position of roller sun blinds unknown 

The raised or lowered positions of the roller sun blinds are stored in the junction box elec¬ 
tronics. An unknown position of the roller sun blind may occur, for example, as a result of 
a voltage reset. If the position is not known, the junction box electronics interprets the 
roller sun blind as being in the raised position. The roller sun blind is then initially lowered 
in response to the next operational request. The direction is reversed if the junction box 
electronics detects blocking directly after actuation. Blocking signals that the roller sun 
blind is at the lower end stop position. 

Blocking detection 

The junction box electronics is equipped with a blocking detection facility to protect the 
motor. This function serves the purpose of immediately switching off the motor on reach¬ 
ing the upper or lower end position. 

Motor actuation is additionally subject to a time monitoring function. Consequently, actu¬ 
ation of the motors is terminated after a defined maximum period of time. 

The roller sun blinds on the side windows also feature a blocking detection function. This 
function is integrated in the electronic circuitry of the switch cluster in the rear door arm¬ 
rest. 

This blocking detection function serves the purpose of switching off the motor on reach¬ 
ing the upper or lower end position. 

The end positions are detected by evaluating the current consumption of the motors, 
thus cancelling activation. After detecting a significant increase in current consumption, 
the motor is short-circuit braked in blocked position and the drive is briefly reversed to 
relief the strain on the mechanical system. 


19 

F01 Power Windows 







The actuation time of the motor for the roller sun blind is additionally monitored. The 
actuation time is limited to 15 seconds. Actuation is then terminated after this period of 
time has elapsed. 

Child safety lock 

The child safety lock function is switched on or off by means of the child safety lock 
switch in the switch cluster on the driver’s side. 

The roller sun blinds can no longer be operated with the rear switches when the child 
safety lock is switched on. 

No request to raise or lower the roller sun blind is triggered when the child safety lock 
button is pressed. Current movement of the roller sun blind is not interrupted when the 
child safety lock is engaged. 

Roller sun blind switches 

All switches have a LIN-bus connection. The switches are connected to terminal 30B 
and a ground connection. 

The motors for the roller sun blinds in the side windows are connected directly to the 
respective switch cluster. The motor for the roller sun blind on the rear window is con¬ 
nected to the junction box electronics. 

The electronic circuitry for the LIN-bus and the power electronics for actuation of the 
motors are integrated in the switch cluster. The electronic circuitry monitors actuation and 
detects the end positions of the roller sun blind. 

The junction box electronics receives information on the end positions from the LIN-bus.

Signal evaluation of the power window switches 

The signals of the power window switch in the driver’s door switch console are evaluated 
directly by the driver’s door switch cluster and transferred to the footwell module via the 
LIN bus. 

The signals from the power window switches in the front passenger’s door as well as the 
power window switches of both rear doors are evaluated by the junction box electronics. 

Control Units 

Car Access System 4 

The Car Access System 4 is the central control unit for opening and closing the windows. 
Therefore, it issues the enable to operate the power windows. 

“Terminal 50 ON” status is sent while starting the engine. The junction box electronics 
and the footwell module prevent operation of the power windows during the start proce¬ 
dure or interrupt current operation of the power windows. This means more energy from 
the battery is available for the starter during engine start-up. 

Footwell module 

The relays for the power window motors for the front doors are installed in the footwell 
module. 

The footwell module provides information on the status of the door contacts and the dri¬ 
ver’s door lock cylinder. 

The footwell module also provides the power window switch and the driver’s door switch 
console with information on the “Terminal 58g ON” status. 

Junction box electronics 

The relays for the power window motors for the rear doors are installed in the junction box 
electronics. 

Identification Transmitter 

The identification transmitter can initiate auto-remote opening/closing of the power win¬ 
dows. 

The operating procedure is defined in the Owner’s Handbook. 

Power Window Motors 

The power window motors are eguipped with Hall sensors that generate signals during 
motor operation. These signals serve the purpose of monitoring motor operation and are 
evaluated for the pressure-sensitive finger guard. 

The signals are evaluated in the footwell module and the junction box electronics.
