Introduction 


Windscreen Wipers 

The F01/F02 has a wiper/washer system for the windscreen as standard. 
Windscreen wiping has the following functions: 

• Continuous wipe in stage 1 

• Continuous wipe in stage 2 

• Flick wipe. 

The following systems are also available: 

• Headlight washer system 

• Water jet heater 

• Automatic mode using the rain/light/solar/condensation sensor. 

The wiper motor for the wiper/washer system is connected via a LIN bus.

Rain/lights/solar/condensation Sensor 

The rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor is the same as the rain/driving lights/solar sen¬ 
sor, but has been enhanced with the condensation sensor function. The functionality of 
the rain sensor, the driving lights sensor and the solar sensor have been retained in full. 
This means, for example, that the driver is still assisted by the rain sensor automatically 
initiating the procedure for switching on the windscreen wipers. 

The automatic wiping does not relieve the customer from the responsibility of wiping the 
windscreen. For this reason, the customer can override the automatic wiping function at 
any time by moving the wiper switch on the steering column stalk up or down or pulling it 
towards him. 

The driving lights sensor supplies the on and off signal for the automatic driving lights 
control function.

Under unfavorable light conditions such twilight or when driving through a tunnel, the ON 
signal ensures the driving lights are switched on automatically. 


The solar sensor makes sure the automatic climate control system provides optimum air 
conditioning distribution in the vehicle. 


The condensation sensor allows the integrated automatic heating/air-conditioning system 
to detect when condensation is forming on the windscreen in good time, even before the 
driver is aware of it. Countermeasures can be taken automatically at an early stage, with¬ 
out the need for driver intervention.

When the wiper switch on the steering column stalk (7) is operated, the wiper motor (1) is 
switched on or off. The junction box electronics execute the functions of the wiper/ wash¬ 
er system. The motor for the washer fluid pump (5) or for the headlight cleaning system 
(4) is switched on or off by the junction box electronics. 

On vehicles with automatic driving lights control, the junction box electronics receive the 
information about switching the wiper/ washer system on/off from the rain/lights/solar/ 
condensation sensor (8). 

The Dynamic Stability Control (10) provides information about the vehicle speed.

The signal produced when the wiper switch on the steering column stalk (12) is operated 
is sent from the SZL steering column switch cluster (13) via the FlexRay to the central 
gateway module (1). The central gateway module transmits the signal on the K-CAN2. 
The junction box electronics (11) switch the wiper motor (2) on, for example and monitor 
its function. 

The washer fluid pump (8) is switched on or off by the junction box electronics. 

On vehicles with automatic driving lights control, the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor 
(15) sends the reguest to switch on the wiper motor, for instance, via the LIN bus. The 
junction box electronics receives the reguest and implements it. 

The roof function center (16) supplies the voltage for the rain/lights/solar/condensation 
sensor.

Functions 


Wiping 

The wiper/washer system is switched on and off with the wiper switch. The wiper switch 
is an integral part of the steering column switch cluster SZL. 

Wiper Switch 

The wiper switch on the steering column stalk does not lock in position. It always returns 
to its start position after every operation. The button for the rain/lights/solar/condensation 
sensor also returns to its starting position after every operation. The wiper-stage switch 
does lock in position. 

The following functions are switched on with the wiper switch on the steering column 
stalk: 

• Automatic wipe with rain/lights/solar/ condensation sensor 

• Continuous wipe, stage 1 

• Continuous wipe, stage 2 

• Flick wipe 

• Wash windscreen 

The signals from the wiper switch on the steering column stalk are sent from the steer¬ 
ing column switch cluster via the FlexRay to the central gateway module. From the cen¬ 
tral gateway module, the signal is transmitted to the junction box electronics via the K- 
CAN2. The junction box electronics evaluates the signals and actuates the wiper motor 
via the LIN bus. The junction box electronics also monitor the wipe function via the LIN 
bus. To do so, the junction box electronics cyclically request the status of the wiper 
motor.

Windscreen Wipe Function 

The following functions are available for wiping the windscreen: 

• Intermittent wipe in stages 

• Automatic wipe 

• Continuous wipe, stage 1 

• Continuous wipe, stage 2 

• Flick wipe. 

Intermittent wipe 

The interval can be set with the multi-stage switch. Four intermittent wipe stages are 
available. The time intervals depend on the set intermittent wipe stage and the vehicle 
speed. The junction box electronics calculate the time intervals and actuate the wiper 
motor accordingly. 

Automatic wipe 

The automatic wipe function can be activated by pressing the axial button from status 
“terminal R ON”. The LED on the wiper switch indicates that the function is active. A 
one-off wipe function (acknowledgement wipe) is additionally started. The acknowledge¬ 
ment wipe is also initiated when the wipe interval is increased by means of the wiper- 
stage switch but not when the wipe interval is decreased. 

The rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor initiates wipe reguests according to the heavi¬ 
ness of the rain. The junction box electronics analyze the signal from the rain/ 
lights/solar/condensation sensor every 20 ms. For this, the junction box electronics 
reguest the relevant signal values and execute the windscreen wipe according to the wipe 
reguest. 

With the automatic wipe function, the wipe speed depends on the information from the 
rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor, i.e. continuous wipe stage 1 or stage 2 may be initi¬ 
ated depending on the rain intensity. 

Continuous wipe, stage 1 

The wiper motor runs at normal speed when stage 1 is switched on with the wiper switch 
on the steering column stalk. The wiper motor switches from continuous wipe in stage 1 
to intermittent wipe if the vehicle speed is reduced down to standstill. 

The continuous wipe function in stage 1 resumes as soon as the vehicle speed is higher 
than 2.5 mph (4 km/h). 

The reset (switch-back) of the wiper stage when the vehicle is stationary can be decoded. 
In this case, the wiper blades operate in continuous wipe stage 1 mode also when the 
vehicle is stationary.

The wiper blades are moved at double the speed in continuous wipe stage 2. When the 
vehicle is stationary, continuous wipe stage 2 automatically switched back to continuous 
wipe stage 1. The wiper blades then move at normal speed. Stage 2 is resumed again at 
a speed in excess of 2.5 mph (4 km/h). 


The wipe function switches back to stage 1 at a speed in excess of 130 mph (210 km/h). 
Stage 2 is switched on again at a speed below 127 mph (205 km/h). 

Decreasing wiper stage (continuous wipe stage 2) 



13 

F01 Wiper/Washer System 



























The reset of the wiper stages when the vehicle is stationary can be decoded. In this case, 
continuous wipe stage 2 is retained also when the vehicle is stationary. 

Flick wipe 

Pressing the wiper switch on the steering column stalk triggers the flick wipe function for 
as long as the switch is pressed. When the wiper switch on the steering column stalk is 
released, the wiper movement is completed until the wiper blades reach the rest position. 

Windscreen Wiper Anti-blocking Function 

The windscreen wiper anti-blocking function is integrated into the electronics of the 
wiper motor. If the wiper motor is obstructed, the electronics cease the actuation of the 
motor. The electronics communicate this via the LIN bus the next time the junction box 
electronics guery the status. 

A further attempt can be made to switch on the wiper. If the wiper blocks again, it will no 
longer be operative for approximately 3 minutes. 

The wiper interlock is cancelled when the status is switched from "terminal R ON" to 
"terminal R OFF". The wiper must then be switched on again. 

Wash Functions 
Wash windscreen 

When the wiper switch on the steering column stalk is pulled, the washer fluid pump is 
first switched on, followed by the windscreen wiper. The washer fluid pump remains 
switched on for as long as the wiper switch on the steering column stalk is pulled. 

The signal is routed from the steering column switch cluster via the FlexRay to the central 
gateway module. It is then transmitted from the central gateway module via the K-CAN2 
to the junction box electronics. The junction box electronics actuate the washer fluid 
pump directly. 

After the pump is switched off, the wipers continue to operate for several wipe cycles in 
order to wipe the windscreen dry. 

The wipe function set before the windscreen wash cycle is continued after the wind¬ 
screen has been washed. 

The junction box electronics will no longer actuate the washer fluid pump if the fluid level 
in the washer fluid reservoir is too low. The junction box electronics receive the informa¬ 
tion necessary for this purpose from the washer fluid level sensor. 

Washer fluid level sensor 

The junction box electronics monitor the washer fluid level sensor from terminal status 
“terminal R ON”. The washer fluid sensor is integrated in the washer fluid reservoir and is 
switched to ground. 

The junction box electronics receive a low signal when the washer fluid reservoir is full. 
The switch opens when the fluid level in the washer fluid reservoir drops below a certain 


14 

F01 Wiper/Washer System 



level. The low signal changes to a high signal. The junction box electronics consequently 
generate a message indicating the low level in the washer fluid reservoir. 

Terminal 50 

The washer function is interrupted or not at all started while the vehicle is started. 

If the windscreen washer function was interrupted, the started function is continued after 
the vehicle start procedure has been completed. 

Headlight Washer System 

The headlight washer system is switched on during the first wash cycle after terminal sta¬ 
tus “terminal R ON” and “lights ON”. Activation is then suppressed for 7 min. The head¬ 
light washer system is activated if the windscreen washer system is operated 5 times 
within the 7 minutes. 

In response to the request from the junction box electronics, the headlight washer system 
is switched on by means of a relay in the distribution box. 

The headlight washer system is no longer activated if the washer fluid level in the washer 
fluid reservoir is too low. The junction box electronics receive the signal from the washer 
fluid sensor. 

The headlight washer system is not actuated either if obstruction of the wipers is detect¬ 
ed. 

BMW Night Vision 

If the vehicle is equipped with BMW Night Vision with person recognition, the Night 
Vision Camera lens is cleaned at the same time as the headlights. The pump in the head¬ 
light washer system supplies water to all the washer jets for the headlights and the Night 
Vision Camera.

System Components 

Involved Components 

The following components are involved in the wiper/washer system: 

• Control units 

- Steering column switch cluster 

- Central gateway module 

- Junction box electronics 

- Instrument cluster 

- Dynamic stability control 

• Rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor 

• Wiper switch on the steering column stalk 

• Relay for headlight washer system 

• Wiper motor 

• Washer fluid pump 

• Pump for headlight washer system 

• Heated washer jets 

Control Units 

Steering column switch cluster 

The steering column switch cluster evaluates the status of the wiper switch on the 
steering column stalk. The respective status is issued by the steering column switch 
cluster on the FlexRay. 

Junction box electronics 

The junction box electronics is the central control unit for all wipe and wash functions. 

The junction box electronics communicate the current wipe requirement via the LIN bus. 
This request is received by the electronics in the wiper motor and the relevant wiper 
stage is initiated. 

A separate relay is fitted in the front distribution box for the headlight washer system. 

Dynamic stability control 

The Dynamic Stability Control provides the road speed signal. 


16 

F01 Wiper/Washer System 




Rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor 

The rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor consists of four sensors. The rain sensor is 
used for the wiper/washer system. 

Condensation sensor 

The condensation sensor consists of a sensor element with integrated processor on a 
flexibly mounted circuit board. The condensation sensor records the relative air humidity 
and the temperature on the inside of the windscreen. 

The rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor is integrated in the base of the mirror and is 
held in place by a spring on a retaining plate. The retaining plate is securely bonded to 
the inside of the windscreen. 

The visual connection between the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor and the wind¬ 
screen is formed by a silicone gel layer on the optical element. The condensation sensor 
is mounted directly on a “flexible” circuit board. 

Due to the specified installation location, the flexible circuit board with the condensation 
sensor is pushed against the windscreen. This ensures a good thermal connection with 
the windscreen. A permeable membrane made from Teflon protects the condensation 
sensor from becoming dirty. 

Fault code memory entries for the function of the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor are 
stored in the junction box electronics. 

If the condensation sensor fails, the junction box electronics transmits this via the K- 
CAN2. The central gateway module transmits the information on the K-CAN. The inte¬ 
grated automatic heating/air-conditioning system thus receives the information and deac¬ 
tivates the program to prevent condensation from forming on the windscreen. 

Note: Replacing the rain/lights/solar/ condensation sensor: 

It is permissible to replace a rain/lights/solar/ condensation sensor as 
long as no bubbles occur in the silicone gel layer (adhesive layer) when 
you do so. Please remember to initialize the sensor. Refer to the Repair 
Instructions for more information.

F01 Wiper/Washer System 



Wiper Switch on the Steering Column Stalk 

The wiper switch on the steering column stalk with the following functions is located in 
the steering column switch cluster: 

• Intermittent wipe 

• Wipe in stages 1 and 2 

• Windscreen washer 

• Headlight washer 

• Switch for the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor 

• Indicator for activated rain/lights/solar/ condensation sensor. 

The wiper switch has sliding contacts that are located on the circuit board for the steering 
column switch cluster. The switch functions are realized by means of these sliding con¬ 
tacts. 

The interval switch is a four-stage switch. Each stage produces different input values in 
the steering column switch cluster. The input values are evaluated for setting the sensitiv¬ 
ity of the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor or the intermittent wipe stage. 

The button for the rain/lights/solar/ condensation sensor is designed as an ground¬ 
switching button. It is reguired for switching on the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor. 
The LED is illuminated when the rain/lights/solar/ condensation sensor is activated.

Wiper Motor 

The front wiper motor is a little smaller than the wiper motor in the E65. 

Advantages of the wiper motor: 

• Lighter 

• Less noise 

• Reversing wiper motor 

• Stable wiper speed 

• Reduced tendency of the wiper blades to judder 

• Alternating rest position of the wiper blades. 

The wiper motor has two speed settings for wiping the windscreen. 

The wiper motor receives information about the wiper stage via the LIN bus. 

The LIN-bus messages are evaluated by electronics in the wiper motor. 

A constant speed is generated by the electronics, enabling consistent wiping by 
the windscreen wipers. 

The wiper motor stores the wiper arms, and therefore also the wiper blades, outside the 
field of vision, as in the E65. In addition, they are stored on alternate sides. This prevents 
unnecessary wear on the wiper blades and they will remain pliant for longer.

Washer Fluid Pump 

A washer fluid pump is located in the washer fluid reservoir for cleaning the windscreen. 
The pump is actuated directly by the junction box electronics. 

Pump for Headlight Washer 

A high pressure pump is used for the headlight washer system. The pump is activated via 
a relay in the front power distribution box. 


Heated Washer Jets 

Three heated water jets are used for the windscreen washer. The washer jets have a PTC 
resistor that automatically limits the power consumption.

Service Information 


Wiper/washer System Emergency Operating Functions 

Emergency Operation in the Event of the Ssteering Column Switch Cluster 
Failing 

The wipers can no longer be operated in the event of the steering column switch cluster 
failing or a break in the bus connection. 

The junction box electronics switch to emergency operating mode and the windscreen 
wipers are switched on in stage 1. 

Emergency Operation if the Rain/lights/solar/condensation Sensor Fails 

If there is a fault in the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor or it fails completely, the 
junction box electronics take over control of the wiper/washer system and switch to 
emergency operating mode. Emergency operating mode is an intermittent wipe 
function that is dependent on the vehicle speed. 

Note: The same applies if the rain/driving lights/solar sensor fails. 

Replacement of the Rain/lights/solar/condensation Sensor 

The following steps are necessary after replacing the sensor: 

• Code the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor 

• Clear fault code memory 

• Initialize the rain/lights/solar/condensation sensor. 

Please refer to the Repair Instructions. 

Note: The same applies to the replacement of the 
rain/driving lights/solar sensor. 

Replacement of the Wiper Motor 

The wiper motor is connected to the LIN bus and this must be taken into consideration 
during the service. 

Note: The Repair Instructions must be observed when the wiper motor is 

replaced. If the LIN bus fails, the wiper will go into emergency operation. 


23 

F01 Wiper/Washer System 




Replacing the Wiper Blades 

The wiper arms can be moved to a service position in order to replace the wiper blades. 
This makes the wiper blades easily accessible and allows them to be replaced. 

Activating the service position 

• Switch on the ignition with the START/STOP button 

• Switch off the ignition with the START/STOP button 

• Operate the wiper switch on the steering column stalk (push it upwards and hold it 
there for more than three seconds). 

The wiper arms now move into the service position (the upper reversal position of the 
wiper blades) and the wiper blades can be replaced.
