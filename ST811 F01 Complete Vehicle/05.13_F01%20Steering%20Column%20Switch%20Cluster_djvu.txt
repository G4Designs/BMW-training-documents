Introduction 


The Steering Column Switch Cluster - An Interface 

The steering column switch cluster is a “mechanical and electrical interface” from the 
steering wheel to the vehicle; it is firmly connected mechanically to the steering column. 
On top of this purely mechanical connection, the steering column switch cluster is 
connected electrically via bus systems or directly to components. 

In the F01/F02, the steering column switch cluster has a steering column stalk on either 
side of the steering column. The right-hand steering column stalk is for activating/ deac¬ 
tivating the wiper/washer system functions. The left-hand steering column stalk is for 
activating/deactivating the high-beam headlight or turn indicators and for operating the 
on-board computer functions. 

A steering column switch cluster with optical steering-angle sensor is built into the F01/ 
F02. The steering-angle sensor uses a non-contact optical measuring system for steer¬ 
ing-angle detection. 

The steering column switch cluster receives the button signal of the steering wheel 
directly or across the LIN bus. These signals are forwarded from the steering column 
switch cluster to the respective control units. 

Signals such as the buttons for controlling the volume of the radio are transmitted by the 
steering column switch cluster across the FlexRay. The steering column switch cluster 
receives e.g. the signal to activate the vibration actuator across the FlexRay. 

The steering column switch cluster forwards the trigger signal of the driver’s airbag 
directly to the priming caps of the airbag. 

For the electrical steering column adjustment, the switch cluster evaluates the button 
and transmits reguests across the FlexRay. 

The steering column switch cluster also evaluate the button for the steering wheel heat¬ 
ing. The steering column switch cluster forwards this signal across the LIN bus to the 
steering wheel electronics.

Functions 


Signal Detection 


The functions of the steering column switch cluster are: 

• Detecting the switching signals of the steering-column switches 

• Detecting the controls in the multifunction steering wheel 

• Resetting the turn indicator 

• Transmitting and receiving information. 


Detecting the Switching Signals of the Steering-column Switches 

The switching signals of the F01/F02 steering-column switches are triggered by the 
steering column stalks. The relevant switches are located on the printed-circuit board of 
the steering column switch cluster. The steering column stalks do not have detent 
notches. Therefore, each time the steering column stalks are operated, they return auto¬ 
matically to their starting position. 

The resistance to movement of the steering column stalks is increased at the end stops 
and in the individual switching positions. This provides the customer with noticeable 
feedback on the respective lever position. 


The toggle switch is designed as locking. Three stop positions are available.

Steering column stalk for turn-indicator / high-beam switch 

The steering column switch cluster generates the switching signals depending on the 
respective position of the steering column stalk. The switching signals are made available 
by the steering column switch cluster across the FlexRay. 

The footwell module receives the reguests from the turn-indicator / high-beam switch as 
well as for the high-beam assistant. 

Pressing the on-board computer button in the axial direction initiates the reguests for the 
onboard computer. The steering column switch cluster sends the requests for display of 
the on-board computer functions across the FlexRay. 

Note: In the case of vehicle equipment without the high-beam assistant, the 
button on the steering column stalk for turn-indicator / high-beam 
switch is not required. Instead, a large button is used.

F01 Steering Column Switch Cluster 






























































Detecting the Controls 

The multifunction steering wheel has additional buttons. The buttons increase in-car 
comfort and convenience by providing for comfort and convenience functions. 

The steering column switch cluster reads in the signals from the steering-wheel buttons. 
The steering column switch cluster transmits these signals across the FlexRay. The asso¬ 
ciated ECU executes the request. 

Steering wheel 

The steering wheel is equipped with the following components: 

• Fanfare-horn button 

• Priming caps for the driver’s airbag 

• Driver’s airbag 

• Buttons for radio operation 

• Buttons for telephone operation 

• Cruise control system buttons 

• Steering wheel electronics 

• Steering wheel heating 

• Vibration actuator. 

The fanfare-horn button is connected directly to the steering column switch cluster. The 
junction box electronics requests the button status of the fanfare-horn button in cycles. 

The steering column switch cluster evaluates the button status and sends this across the 
FlexRay to the junction box electronics. 

The buttons for the radio, telephone and cruise control system are connected via the LIN 
bus. The applies to the steering wheel electronics. The central control unit for this equip¬ 
ment attached to the LIN bus is the steering column switch cluster. 

The right-hand button block contains the master function for the left-hand button block 
and has an electronic evaluation unit. The electronic evaluation unit picks up the button 
status of the individual buttons. The electronic evaluation unit implements the button sta¬ 
tus on the LIN bus. The steering column switch cluster requests the button status in 
cycles and thus finds out whether a button was operated or not. The steering column 
switch cluster transmits the button status across the FlexRay. In this way, the information 
reaches the other control units in the vehicle network. 

Note: The signal sent from the steering column switch cluster across the 
FlexRay must be implemented in the central gateway module on the 
K-CAN2, PT-CAN or MOST. This enables the footwell module, the 
junction box electronics etc. to execute the desired requests. 


15 

F01 Steering Column Switch Cluster 




Resetting the Turn Indicator 

The footwell module the information regarding the steering-wheel turn reguires to reset 
the turn indicator lights. 

The steering column switch cluster determines this steering-wheel turn and makes it 
available across the FlexRay. The central gateway module implements the signal on the 
K-CAN2, thus providing the footwell module with the information. Depending on the 
steering-wheel position, the footwell module decides whether the turn indicator has to be 
deactivated or not. 

Steering-wheel-rotation information 

The optical steering-angle sensor detects the neutral position within 360° of the optical 
steering-angle sensor. With a steering wheel turn of more than 360°, the information 
regarding the steering-wheel turn is also included in the steering angle calculation. 

Receiving and Transmitting Signals 

The detected and calculated data from the steering column switch cluster are forwarded 
across the FlexRay to the corresponding control units. 

The steering column switch cluster can be diagnosed via the central gateway module 
with the BMW diagnosis system. The diagnosis information can be called up via the 
FlexRay. 

Vibration actuator 

The KAFAS control unit, for example, reguests activation of the vibration actuator via the 
PT-CAN. The central gateway module implements the signal on the FlexRay. This means 
the Integrated Chassis Management receives the reguest for activation. The Integrated 
Chassis Management co-ordinates activation of the vibration actuator. 

Note: Coordination is necessary, as the lane departure warning and lane 

change warning can be fitted in the vehicle. Depending on the request 
from the two assistance systems, the Integrated Chassis Management 
forwards this to the vibration actuator. 

The steering wheel electronics evaluate the reguest, activate the vibration actuator and 
monitor its function. In the event of a defect in the vibration actuator or steering wheel 
electronics, the steering column switch cluster indicates this via the FlexRay. 

Priming caps for the driver’s airbag 

The priming caps of the driver’s airbag are connected directly via the coil spring to the 
Crash Safety Module, ACSM. Triggering the airbag is the responsibility of the Crash 
Safety Module. 


16 

F01 Steering Column Switch Cluster 



Redundant signal 

The signals from the steering column stalk for turn-indicator / high-beam switch for turn 
indicator lights as well as headlight flasher are transferred across the FlexRay. To increase 
the availability, the steering column switch cluster is connected directly by a cable to the 
footwell module. The signals e.g. for the headlight flasher or turn indicator lights are trans¬ 
ferred redundantly across this cable. 

Optical Steering-angle Sensor 

All systems that influence driving dynamics are reguired alongside other data for the 
steering angle and steering-angle speed as the basis for calculation. 

The steering angle as well as steering-angle speed are picked up by a non-contact opti¬ 
cal measuring system, the optical steering-angle sensor. 

The data of the optical steering-angle sensor are processed by the electronics in the 
steering column switch cluster and sent across the FlexRay to the Integrated Chassis 
Management. 

Information such as the absolute steering angle or the steering-wheel-turn is calculated. 
The optical steering-angle sensor picks up a steering angle of -640° / +640°.

F01 Steering Column Switch Cluster 

















Detecting Steering Angle and Steering-Angle Speed 

To pick up the steering angle, a code disc is illuminated from above by an LED and a 
light-conducting element. Due to the pattern in the code disc, the light from above only 
reaches down to certain areas. There, the light encounters photo-transistors. 

The pattern of the code disc corresponds to the digital code of the steering angle. 

The photo-transistors convert the light signals into electrical signals. As the signals are 
not yet sufficiently unambiguous, they are processed by downstream electronics. 

Thereafter, the signals are digitized and have the signal states 1 or 0. 

The steering column switch cluster receives the current value of the steering angle, the 
digital code, and forwards this across the FlexRay. 

A section of the code disc and the optical sensor are shown below. 


Section on the code disc 


Optical sensor 




The code disc (1) rotates depending on 
the steering-wheel position. The pattern of 
the digital code (2) on the code disc 
changes in 0.5° steps. The light of the 
light-conducting element (3) penetrates 
the pattern of the digital code of the code 
disc. 


The light beams encounter the photo-tran¬ 
sistors in accordance with the pattern of 
the digital code. The photo-transistors 
convert the light beams into electrical sig¬ 
nals. The downstream electronics ensure 
that the electrical signals have the signal 
states 1 or 0. This means that the steering 
angle is available to the steering column 
switch cluster as a digital code. 


18 

F01 Steering Column Switch Cluster 















Section on the code disc 



If the code disc (1) continues to rotate, the 
pattern (2) on the code disc changes. The 
light of the light-conducting element (3) 
penetrates the code disc in other areas. 


Optical sensor 



A new digital code is generated in accor¬ 
dance with the changed pattern of the dig¬ 
ital code. This means that the new steering 
angle is available to the steering column 
switch cluster as a digital code. 


19 

F01 Steering Column Switch Cluster 









Relative steering angle (± 640°) 

The relative steering angle specifies the angle position of the steering wheel. The infor¬ 
mation regarding the relative steering angle is always retained, even if the power to the 
control unit is switched off. A renewed zero-point adjustment is only necessary if the 
steering column switch cluster has been replaced. This also applies if the dynamic stabili¬ 
ty control system is replaced or repairs become necessary on the steering / steering col¬ 
umn. 

Absolute steering angle 

The absolute steering angle is a calculation based on the relative steering angle and the 
information regarding steering-wheel turn. The absolute and relative steering angles are 
defined during the zero-point adjustment of the steering column switch cluster. The 
steering column switch cluster knows every position of the steering wheel across the 
entire range of steering rotation. 

A precondition before every zero-point adjustment is the straight-ahead setting of the 
wheels and of the steering wheel. 

Steering-angle speed 

The steering-angle speed is the product of the change in the individual steering-angle 
data during steering wheel turn. 

The steering column switch cluster calculates the value and forwards it across the 
FlexRay to the vehicle network.

System Components 


The Steering Column Switch Cluster as Standard Equipment 

The steering column switch cluster (SZL) consists of, among other things, the following 
components: 

• Electronic steering column switch cluster module 

• Coil-spring assembly 

• Steering-column switch for turn indicators 

• Steering column switch for wipers 

• Optical steering-angle sensor. 

The steering column switch cluster (SZL) can only be replaced as a complete unit. The 
individual components such as the coil-spring assembly or steering column stalk can 
not be removed or replaced. 

The design and the components of the steering column switch cluster are explained in 
brief in the following.

Optical Steering-angle Sensor 

The steering column switch cluster contains the optical steering-angle sensor as well as 
the associated electronics. A second processor on the underside of the board backs up 
the information regarding the steering angle and steering-angle speed. This is why the 
steering angle and steering-angle speed are evaluated and calculated in the second 
processor in addition to the main processor of the steering column switch cluster. 

The steering-angle sensor is designed as a non-contact optical angle measurement sys¬ 
tem. The system consists of a code disc and an optical sensor. The code disc is con¬ 
nected directly to the steering wheel via a driver. If the steering wheel is moved, the code 
disc rotates within the optical sensor. 

The code disc has a pattern of holes. The pattern of holes is arranged in such a way that 
four circular tracks are formed. The four tracks represent the digital range of the sensor. 
The digital code changes when the steering is turned every 0.5°.

Optical sensor 

The optical sensor is located on a circuit board soldered onto the board of the steering

• Code disc 

• Photo-transistors.

LED and light-conducting element 

The LED - in conjunction with the light-conducting element - has the task of projecting 
light from above onto the code disc. The LED is directly soldered onto the sensor circuit 
board. The light-conducting element is clipped onto the board of the steering column 
switch cluster. 


The light-conducting element is split three ways at the light exit. The light is projected in 
such a way that a light field is formed at each light exit and beamed downwards onto the 
code disc. Depending on the pattern on the code disc, light is allowed through or not. 


Photo-transistors 

There are four photo-transistors below the light exits on the circuit board of the optical 
sensor of the steering column switch cluster. The photo-transistors detect the optical sig¬ 
nals that penetrate the code disc. The photo-transistors convert the optical signals into 
electrical signals. 


25 

F01 Steering Column Switch Cluster 
















Operating Principle of Optical Steering Angle Detection 
Steering angle detection 

The code disc enables a 4-digit digital code to be generated for each light field. The 12- 
digit digital code is formed by lining up the 4-digit digital codes. The steering-angle 
speed can be ascertained from the changes to the individual digital codes.

Activation of LED 


The LED (8) is supplied with pulse-width modulated voltage, thus also supplying the 
light-conducting element (5) with infrared light. The light-conducting element projects the 
light onto the code disc (4). The photo-transistors (3) pick up the light signals. 

The signals of the photo-transistors are processed in the downstream electronics (2) into 
the signals “1 ” or “0”. The signals of the 12 photo-transistors are put together to form the 
digital code. 

The sliding register (1) picks up the digital code and forwards it to the electronics of the 
steering column switch cluster.

The button blocks as well as the steering wheel electronics are linked across the LIN bus 
to the electronics in the steering column switch cluster. 

With the corresponding reguest, the steering wheel electronics control and monitor the 
function of the vibration actuator and steering wheel heating. 

The priming caps of the airbags are connected directly and are activated by the Crash 
Safety Module, ACSM. 

The fanfare-horn button is evaluated by the electronics of the steering column switch 
cluster. 


Steering Wheel Button Block 


Button block for driving functions 

The steering wheel contains a button block for the Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) or 
Active Cruise Control (ACC) Stop & Go functions. The button block is located on the left- 
hand side of the steering wheel.

The toggle switch be moved upwards or 
downwards and is not designed as lock¬ 
ing. Each time the toggle switch is oper¬ 
ated, it returns to its home position. Each 
direction of the toggle switch has two 
stages. See table. 

The I/O button can be used to switch the 
Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) and 
Active Cruise Control (ACC) Stop & Go function to standby or to switch it off. 

Pressing the RES button (resume) calls up and activates the last stored driving speed 
value.

Button block for telephone / radio 

The button block is located on the right-hand side of the steering wheel. The buttons can 
be used to operate functions for the radio or telephone. 

The MODE button can be used e.g. to switch between the individual audio sources. 

Operating the toggle switch + or -changes the radio volume, for example. 

The knurled wheel is designed as locking. Operating the knurled wheel (turning upwards 
or downwards) selects individual radio stations, for example. 

Pressing the knurled wheel memorizes the selection of the radio station, for example.

Steering Column Adjustment and Steering Wheel Heating Button 

The button for the steering column adjustment can be moved in four directions. It can be 
used to adjust the steering column upwards and downwards; the distance to the driver 
can also be adjusted. 

The steering column switch cluster evaluates the button status and forwards it to the 
footwell module. The signal must go across the FlexRay to the central gateway module. 
From there, the signal is sent on the K-CAN2 to the footwell module. Accordingly, the 
footwell module activates the motors for steering column adjustment. 

The footwell module monitors activation and function. 

Note: The footwell module is the central control unit for the electrical steering 
column adjustment. The position of the steering column can be called 
up or stored in the footwell module for the memory function. 

The button for the steering wheel heating is evaluated by the electronics of the steering 
column switch cluster. The electronics in the steering column switch cluster send a 
reguest across the LIN bus to the steering wheel electronics to switch the steering wheel 
heating on / off. 

The steering wheel electronics switch the steering wheel heating on and monitor its 
function. The steering wheel heating has an NTC resistor. This resistor is reguired for 
temperature control of the steering wheel heating.

Service Information 


Replacing the Steering Column Switch Cluster 

Particular care must be taken when replacing the steering column switch cluster or work¬ 
ing on the steering column. Comply with the repair instructions. 

The coil spring is a very sensitive component of the steering column switch cluster. If 
sufficient care is not taken when replacing the steering column switch cluster, the coil 
spring or another component can be destroyed. A conseguence of this can be that the 
steering column switch cluster only works in part or does not work at all. 

Note: If e.g. communication with the steering column switch cluster across 
the FlexRay is disrupted, the junction box electronics switch the wind¬ 
screen wipers to the emergency mode. 

The steering column switch cluster can only be ordered as a complete exchange part. 
After replacement, the new steering column switch cluster must be adapted to the car. 

This involves among other things: 

• Initialization of the steering column switch cluster 

• Zero-point adjustment of the steering-angle sensor 

• Front wheels in the straight-ahead position 

• Function test. 

For further information, refer to the repair instructions and the BMW diagnosis system. 

Note: The transportation lock of the steering column switch cluster is only to 
be removed after replacement, shortly before fitting the steering wheel.
