Introduction 


New Generation of Familiar Systems 

General 

Nowadays, the dynamic handling systems are subdivided into three groups according to 
the co-ordinate axis that their function relates to. 

Development continued over the years with the EDC II (E24) and EDC III (E31, E38 and 
E39) and ultimately the EDC-K(“K” stands for continuous) in the E65. 

The E65 then became the first model to feature a new vertical dynamics system called 
ARS Active Roll Stabilization, which was marketed as “Dynamic Drive”. 

The existing vertical dynamics systems are also complemented by the EHC electronic 
ride-height control system which made its BMW debut on the E39 (air springs on 2 
wheels) and E53 (air springs on all 4 wheels). 

With the arrival of the E70 came an increasing level of system integration in the area of 
dynamic handling and for the first time a central control unit was used for the vertical 
dynamics systems which was called the VDM Vertical Dynamics Management unit. 

With the new VDC Vertical Dynamics Control function, independent electronic damper 
control for each wheel was realized for the first time. 

On the E70, and subseguently also on the E71, VDC was combined with ARS under the 
name of Adaptive Drive. 

On the F01/F02, that constant development of the vertical dynamics systems has 
continued and the new generation of vertical dynamics management is referred to 
internally as VDC II.

Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) 


General Information 

Active Roll Stabilization was first fitted on the 7 Series predecessor, the E65/E66, and 
has been used in similar form since on the E6x and E7x models. 

This section only describes the essential details and modifications of the ARS on the 
F01/F02. 

As Vertical Dynamics Control (VDC) is fitted as standard on the F01/F02, the ARS 
optional extra (now also available in the US markets) is always offered as a combination. 

In customer communications, ARS continues to be marketed under the name “Dynamic 
Drive” on the F01/F02. 

System Dynamics 

VDC and ARS have to respond with the appropriate speed in the event of rapid lane 
changes, rapid cornering or rapid changes of direction on winding country roads. 

The ARS systems on previous model series had a separate control unit with the appro¬ 
priate output stages for controlling the ARS valve manifold. The system architecture on 
the F01/F02 now features two different vertical dynamics management (VDM) control 
units: 

• If ARS is not fitted, the VDM has no output stages for ARS valve manifold control 

• If ARS is fitted, the VDM has output stages for ARS valve manifold control 

The system dynamics of ARS and VDC are determined by the duration of the following 
stages: 


Process 

Time 

Signal detection by sensors, processing of sensor signals in the control unit,

Change of direction, reversal offeree direction, directional control valve

Operating States 
Straight-ahead travel 

When the engine is started, the pump delivers hydraulic fluid to the system and a back 
pressure builds up. The pressure difference of approximately 1 bar which exists between 
the chambers of the control motor is very small and has no effect on the anti-roll bar. 

The pressure valves for the front-axle anti-roll bar (PW) and rear-axle anti-roll bar (PVH) 
are not supplied with current and are therefore open. The hydraulic fluid can flow back 
into the fluid reservoir directly. The pump’s new intake restrictor valve is energized so that 
the circulation pressure can be substantially lowered when driving in a straight line in 
order to reduce C02 emission. This condition remains unchanged as long as the vehicle 
is travelling straight ahead. The system function is displayed continuously up to 10 mph. 
The full stabilization capacity is available from 10 mph upwards. 

Cornering 

As the vehicle enters a bend, the signals from the lateral acceleration sensor in the ICM 
are sent to the VDM control unit. The control unit then sends a pulse-width modulated 
(PWM) signal to the pressure valves for the front and rear-suspension hydraulic motors 
and simultaneously stops restriction of pump intake by switching off the power to the 
intake restrictor valve. The greater the lateral acceleration, the higher is the PWM signal 
current for the pressure valves. The stronger the current supplied to the valve, the more 
the valve closes and the higher the pressure which builds up in the anti-roll bars. 

The pressures at the anti-roll bars are detected by pressure sensors (10, 11) and 
signalled to the control unit. The direction valve (9) is activated by the control unit to 
create a pressure build-up which corresponds to the progression of the bend (left or 
right-hand bend). A sensor (8) detects the switching position of the direction valve.

Safety Concept 
General information 

The safety concept prevents malfunctioning of the system by monitoring signals and 
responds in a defined manner to faults caused by external problems on interfacing units 
or systems. System monitoring essentially comprizes of the following monitoring 
functions: 

• Monitoring of the power supply voltage 

• Monitoring of the electrical circuits for the valves and sensors within the system 

• Monitoring of FlexRay bus communication and checking signal plausibility 

• Monitoring hydraulic function when the vehicle is in motion and predrive test 

If a fault is detected, a defined response is initiated according to the significance of the 
fault (function impairment). The VDM control unit records the fault in the fault memory 
and displays the response on the instrument cluster. 

Limited function (fail-back level) 

If a system fault has been detected which allows continued operation of the system with 
limited functionality, this is indicated together with a warning message 



ARS indicator lamp (yellow) 


Serious fault (fall-back level) 

If a serious fault is detected, the ARS system is set to “failsafe mode” and this is indicat¬ 
ed on the instrument cluster. A CC message advises the driver to take corners more 
slowly. 



ARS indicator lamp (yellow) 


If the failsafe condition is activated, the failsafe valve is closed by means of a spring. The 
hydraulic fluid in the front anti-roll bar is sealed in, thereby ensuring an adeguate anti-roll 
effect and an understeer effect eguivalent to that of a conventional suspension and steer¬ 
ing system. The failsafe situation is shown by the hydraulic circuit diagram below.

Fluid loss due to external leakage 

The hydraulic circuits of the ARS system and the steering system are linked to one 
another by virtue of a shared fluid reservoir. The VDM control unit monitors the fluid level 
in the reservoir by means of a fluid level sensor. Loss of fluid due to external leakage in 
the hydraulic circuits of the ARS or steering systems leads to a drop in the fluid level in 
the shared fluid reservoir. Fluid loss can result in total failure of the ARS system and 
impairment of the steering system. If the fluid level sensor trips, the ARS system is set to 
failsafe mode and a fault is registered on the VDM control unit. 



ARS indicator lamp (red) 


Simultaneously, a CC message is issued warning of impairment of ARS system and 
steering system function. The driver is instructed to carefully bring the vehicle to a halt 
and switch off the engine. 

Initialization/reset performance 

When the VDM control unit is booted up, various checks and initialization routines are 
executed. They include checks of the electrical circuits for the valves and the sensors 
within the system, an authentication check involving guerying the VIN number on the 
CAS and testing FlexRay communication. The system is not enabled until the tests have 
been successfully completed. Occurring faults are stored and displayed. 

Predrive test 

Every time the engine is started or the vehicle is stopped, an automatic guick test of the 
hydraulic function of the failsafe valve and front-suspension pressure regulating valve is 
carried out which lasts only 450 ms and is imperceptible to the driver. That test is only 
started when the engine is running and the vehicle is stationary, provided no other fault is 
present. If the predrive test identifies a fault, the appropriate fault response is initiated.

Components 


Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) 

Control Unit 

The VDM control unit is located in the passenger compartment near the right-hand A- 
pillar. The VDM control unit receives its power supply via Terminal 15N and is protected 
by a 5A fuse. The VDM control unit is activated exclusively by the Car Access System 
(CAS) via a Terminal 15N lead as of status “Ignition ON”.

Explanation

VDM control unit 


A vehicle authentication process takes place when the system is started. This compares 
the vehicle identification number from the CAS with the vehicle identification number 
which is encoded on the VDM control unit. 


That is followed by a check of the VDM control unit’s hardware and software. All outputs 
(valve solenoids and sensors) are subjected to a comprehensive check for short circuits 
and circuit breaks. If there is a fault, the system switches the actuators to a safe-driving 
mode. 

The VDM control unit switches off if the voltage is too low/too high. 


28 

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 








VDM control unit inputs 

From the input signals, the VDM control unit calculates the control signals to the actua¬ 
tors. The input signals are also checked for plausibility and used for system monitoring. 

The VDM control unit receives the following input signals: 

• FlexRaybus 

• Front-suspension circuit pressure (analog) 

• Rear-suspension circuit pressure (analog) 

• Switch position detector reading (analog) 

• Fluid level sensor signal (analog) 

The most important control signal for the ARS function is the lateral acceleration mea¬ 
sured by the ICM control unit, which is sent to the VDM via the FlexRay bus. Additional 
lateral dynamics information from the FlexRay bus which is also provided by the ICM 
comprizes the road speed signal and the steering angle. From that, the stabilization 
requirement is calculated and the relevant active forces are applied. The road speed and 
steering angle information is also used to improve the reaction time of the system. 

VDM control unit outputs 

All outputs are compatible with diagnostics and protected against short-circuit. The out¬ 
puts include controls for: 

• Pressure regulating valves for front and rear axle 

• Failsafe valve 

• Directional valve 

• Intake restrictor valve 

• 5 V power supply for the sensors: 

- Pressure sensors at the front and rear axle 

- Switch-position detector (SSE) 

The valves are controlled by the supply of current regulated by pulse-width modulation 
(PWM). The current measurements of the individual coil currents are designed with 
redundancy. The valve currents are mutually checked for plausibility on a continuous 
basis. 

Thanks to the current measurement, the pressure can be set more precisely and the 
switch valves can be monitored electronically. Fault symptoms of the output signals are: 

• Short circuit to Terminal 30 and Terminal 31 

• Open circuit and 

• Valve short circuits 

• Sensor power supply faults 

29 

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 



A message is sent to the DME via the FlexRay bus from the central dynamic handling 
controller on the ICM. The message contains information on how much power the tan¬ 
dem pump currently reguires to supply the active anti-roll bars. In this way, output at the 
engine can be increased to satisfy the additional power reguirement. A regular data sig¬ 
nal (alive signal) is broadcast and read by other VDM control units to identify whether the 
system is still active. In addition, a function status signal is broadcast which communi¬ 
cates the status of the ARS function. The VDM control unit transmits an additional status 
message via the FlexRay to the instrument cluster in order to actively initiate display mes¬ 
sages. 

That status message is assigned a priority among all suspension/steering messages by 
the message co-ordinator on the ICM control unit and passed to the instrument cluster. 
All signal faults are recorded and permanently stored in the fault memory. If the alive sig¬ 
nal fails, the ICM control unit automatically sends a message to the instrument cluster to 
activate the ARS warning lamp.

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 









The hydraulic motor and the hydraulic motor body are each attached to one half of the 
anti-roll bar. The active anti-roll bar consists of the oscillating motor and the anti-roll bar 
halves fitted to the oscillating motor, with press-fitted roller bearings for their connection 
to the axle carriers. The use of roller bearings ensures optimum comfort thanks to better 
response and reduced control forces. A thin coating of grease on the roller bearing does 
not impair the function of the active anti-roll bar. 


Operating principle of oscillating motors 

The oscillating motor has three functions to perform: 

• The oscillating motor transfers the torgue into the anti-roll bars. 

• The hydraulic motor isolates the two halves of the anti-roll bar 

• In the event of system failure (failsafe mode), the front axle anti-roll bar creates suffi¬ 
cient damping via the oscillating motor hydraulic fluid (hydraulic locking). The front 
suspension anti-roll bar then works like a conventional anti-roll bar. 

Exception: if the hydraulic motor chambers no longer contain any fluid as a result of a 
leak, the front suspension anti-roll bar cannot provide a damping force. The opposing 
chambers in the oscillating motor are connected to one another. The same pressure 
exists in both chambers. Two chambers are supplied with high-pressure fluid using one 
connection. The two other chambers are connected to the tank via the return line. 


The forces F H (High) or F L (Low) are created as a result of the differences in pressure. 
Since F|_j is greater than F L , a torgue M s is produced, which causes the shaft to turn in 
relation to the housing. 



Since one half of the stabilizer bar is connected to the shaft, and the other with the hous¬ 
ing, the two halves turn in opposite directions. This torgue M s generates the active 
moment M A around the vehicle longitudinal axis via the anti-roll bar connections which 
counteracts the rolling moment M during cornering. 


31 

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 








The shell is forced upwards on the outside of a curve, and dragged down on the inside of 
a curve. The maximum level of body torgue on the front and rear suspension occurs 
when there is a high rate of lateral acceleration. The system pressure is then 180 bar on 
the front suspension and also 180 bar on the rear suspension. If the oscillating motor 
twists as a conseguence of external forces (road excitation, e.g. bumps or potholes), the 
oscillating motor then acts as a torsional-vibration damper. 

As a result of the twisting action, fluid is forced out of the two chambers. The displaced 
fluid flows through the pipes and the hydraulic valve manifold, the hydraulic resistance of 
which produces a damping effect. In the event of failsafe locking (hydraulic locking), the 
oscillating motor can only twist with a very high damping effect as a conseguence of the 
hydraulic jamming in the oscillating motor. 

Function of pressure relief valves 

When the vehicle is driven on poor road surfaces, the movements of the anti-roll bar pro¬ 
duce transient low pressures (cavitation) and pressure peaks in the hydraulic motors 
which can cause rattling noises. To prevent those noises, pressure relief valves and inter¬ 
nal pulsation dampers have been fitted on the front hydraulic motor. The pressure relief 
valves allow filtered air to flow into the hydraulic motor to prevent cavitation. That small 
guantity of air is absorbed by the hydraulic fluid (Pentosin) to form an emulsion which is 
discharged in the course of subseguent operation of the hydraulic motor. The surplus air 
is separated out in the expansion tank.

The hydraulic valve block is located on the floor plate of the vehicle behind the front right- 
hand wheel housing level with the front right- hand door. The hydraulic valve block is 
connected to a carrier plate bolted to the body. The hydraulic valve block houses the fol¬ 
lowing valves and sensors: 

• 2 pressure valves; 1 for the front suspension and 1 for the rear suspension 
[these are proportional pressure limiting valves] 

• 1 directional control valve

The hydraulic pumps fitted in this model series were based on a modular design princi¬ 
ple. Depending on the engine and eguipment specification, a suitably dimensioned 
hydraulic pump is flange-mounted to the engine in the same installation space. 

Decisive eguipment features for these tandem pumps: 

• Basic steering 

• Integrated Active Steering (IAL) 

• C02 reduction measures 

• Dynamic Drive (ARS) 

• Dynamic Drive (ARS) and Integrated Active Steering (IAL) 

• Intake restrictor valve

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 












The hydraulic pump driven by the engine’s poly-V belt is, on vehicles with Dynamic Drive, 
invariably a tandem pump, which consists of a radial-piston pump section for ARS and a 
vane pump section for the power steering. 

Radial-piston pump section of the tandem pump 

This radial piston pump has 8 pistons in a single row and is designed for a maximum 
pressure of 210 bar. 

When the engine is idling, the pump speed is approximately 750 rpm. At that speed, the 
radial piston pump section delivers a minimum fluid flow rate of approximately 5.5 l/min at 
a pressure of approximately 3 bar. Conseguently an adeguate fluid flow rate is guaran¬ 
teed even at idling speed. 

At a pump speed of 1450 rpm, the maximum fluid flow rate is limited to approximately 
9 l/min. 

New feature 

As a C02 reduction measure when driving in a straight line, the fluid flow rate of the radial 
piston pump is restricted by a restrictor valve on the intake side, thereby substantially 
reducing the circulation pressure and, therefore, the engine power used to drive the 
pump. As a result, active control of the intake restrictor valve makes a positive contribu¬ 
tion to the C02 eguation. 

The Dynamic Drive and hydraulic power steering share a common fluid reservoir and fluid 
cooler.

Vertical Dynamics Control 


General Information 

When driven vigorously or on an uneven road surface, a vehicle tends to respond with 
undesirable body movements. BMW first developed Vertical Dynamics Control for the 
E70 and was able to effectively reduce such body motion as a result. 

VDC improves the following driver-perception related vehicle characteristics according to 
road surface conditions: 

• Body-related ride comfort (primary ride comfort) 

• Roadwheel-related ride comfort (secondary ride comfort) 

• Dynamic handling (transitional response, agility) even with more comfortable sus¬ 
pension setting. 

BMW is the first manufacturer to offer a damper adjustment system that is continuously 
controllable independently of damper compression/extension as is the case with the 
VDC (2) on the F01/F02. 

The essential improvements compared with VDC (1) are: 

• 1 EDC control valve for damper extension control 

• 1 EDC control valve for damper compression control 

• “Pre-opening adjustment” for improved body stabilization (has adjustment effect 
even at low damper rates) 

• Driver-perceptible broad spread in conjunction with the handling setting switch (dif¬ 
ference between soft and hard characteristics) 

• Separately adjustable characteristic for roadwheel-related ride comfort (extension 
characteristic independent of compression characteristic)

Signal Processing 

• The vertical movement of the wheels is detected by the wheel-acceleration sensors 
integrated in the EDC satellite control units 

• From the wheel acceleration rates and the ride height signals (FlexRay bus) the vehi¬ 
cle body motion is calculated 

• In addition, signals such as the vehicle road speed are read from the FlexRay bus for 
the purpose of determining reguired damping forces. 

Signal processing/VDC (2) controller 

Individual damping forces are calculated for each individual wheel according to the vehicle 
body motion, the wheel motion and the additional signals read from the FlexRay bus, and 
are sent every 2.5 ms to the EDC satellite control units. 

Damping Force Adjustment 

• Stored on each EDC satellite control module is the actual individual damper charac¬ 
teristic, making it possible to minimize differences from the specified characteristic 
arising from manufacturing tolerances 

• From the specified damping force and the damper characteristic data map, the EDC 
satellite control units calculate the reguired current to be applied to the damper 
extension valve and compression valve

VDM 


The location of the VDM control unit is dependent on the country in which the vehicle is 
sold. 


• On left-hand drive vehicles the control unit is fitted inside the passenger compart¬

• On right-hand drive vehicles the control unit is fitted inside the passenger compart¬

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 







There are two different versions of the VDM control unit according to the equipment 
options fitted on the vehicle. 

• The basic version of the VDM control unit is used if the vehicle has only the standard 
VDC equipment 

• The high-spec version of the VDM control unit is used if, as well as the standard 
VDC system, the vehicle also has ARS Active Roll Stabilization (Dynamic Drive). 

In that case, the output stages for controlling the ARS valve manifold are also inte¬ 
grated in the VDM control unit.

The VDC dampers on the rear suspension are either steel-spring or air-spring versions 
depending on the optional equipment fitted.

Difference between a VDC (1) and a VDC (2) damper: 

A VDC (1) damper with only one EDC data map valve uses combined 
extension/compression adjustment which has to be cycled extremely rapidly. 

With this type of control, the damper adjustment is based on wheel frequency. 

The wheel frequency is the frequency at which the wheel oscillates along the z-axis.

A VDC (2) damper with two EDC data-map valves uses independent extension/ compres¬ 
sion adjustment which does not demand such a high cycling rate. 

With this type of control, the damper adjustment can be based on body freguency. 

The body freguency is the freguency at which the body oscillates along the z-axis.

Fluid flow during compression 



Control strategy 

The fundamental control principle is known as the “Skyhook system”, the name of which 
reveals the primary control objective of holding the vehicle stationary in a vertical direction 
regardless of driving situation as if suspended from a “hook in the sky”. 

To achieve this highest of all comfort objectives, the movements of the entire body have 
to be evaluated. Thus an overall analysis is performed of the ride height data and z-axis 
acceleration rates. 

Furthermore, VDC regulation takes into consideration steering inputs (e.g. transition from 
straight-ahead travel to cornering) based on the steering angle curve. If VDC detects a 
rapid increase in the steering angle, the controller infers that the vehicle is entering a 
bend and can preventively adjust the dampers on the outside of the bend to a harder set¬ 
ting in advance. Thus VDC assists the ARS system, if fitted, and contributes to reducing 
vehicle roll (roll tendency). 

Moreover, VDC is able to detect the braking operations by the driver based on the brake 
pressure information supplied by DSC. A high brake pressure normally results in pitching 
of the vehicle body; VDC counteracts that effect by setting the front dampers to higher 
damping forces. This also results in an improvement in the front/rear brake force distribu¬ 
tion, which in turn reduces the braking distance (by comparison with a vehicle without 
VDC). 


47 

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 















































































On the E70/E71 with VDC (1), the “Sport” button for switching between comfort and 
sports setting only affected the VDC characteristics. 

With the introduction of the handling setting switch, the VDC setting is incorporated in a 
number of modes which bring about a coordinated overall setting across all systems. 

Ride-height Sensor 





Index 

Explanation 

1 

Electrical connector

Lever 


The angle of a pivoting lever is converted into a voltage signal by the ride height sensor. 
The greater the angle (relative to a defined starting or zero position), the greater is the 
output voltage. It is generated by a Hall-effect sensor element. 

Designs 

There are always four ride-height sensors fitted on all F01/F02 models. 

The ride-height sensors fitted all operate according to the same principle but there are 
different designs (different part numbers). The reason for the differences are the available 
space and the starting position (zero position) of the individual ride-height sensors. 

Depending on whether or not the vehicle is fitted with Electronic Height Control (EHC), 
double or single ride-height sensors are fitted on the rear suspension. 

On the front suspension, single ride-height sensors are always used.

Electronic Ride-height Control 

Function of Air Springs 

The various control modes on the F01/F02 are similar to those on other model series 
such as the E70: 

EHC control mode flowchart for F01/F02 



Control Modes with Single-axle Air Suspension 

Ongoing control operations are not affected by transitions from one mode to another. 
However, in the case of load cutout OFF (VA_AUS), control operations are always con¬ 
cluded in order to safeguard system deactivation. The EHC control unit then sets Sleep 
mode. 

Important: All technical data quoted are code-specified as at SOP. 


50 

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 












Sleep Mode 

The vehicle is in Sleep mode at the latest by the time it has been parked for longer than a 
few minutes without a door or hood/trunk lid being operated or the terminal status chang¬ 
ing. This is the initial state of the control system. No control function is performed in 
Sleep mode. The control system goes into Pre-mode when a wake-up signal is received 
by the EHC control unit. 

Post-mode 

Post-mode is activated in order to compensate for any inclination or to adjust the ride 
height after driving and between the Pre-mode and Sleep mode. 

Duration of Post-mode is limited to approximately 1 minute. This mode is only executed if 
the engine has been running before the system switches into this mode. If the engine 
has not been running, the system switches directly from Pre-mode to Sleep mode. 

Control adjustments are made within a tight tolerance band using the following coding 
parameters: 


Coding parameter 

Value 

niv_post_up_e 

- 59 mm 

niv_post_up_d 

- 07 mm 

niv_post_down_e 

+ 06 mm 

niv_post_down 

+ 04 mm 


The fast signal filter is used. 

In the event of an inclination (Kerb mode), the control operation takes place for the nomi¬ 
nal heights applicable in this situation. 

Pre-mode 

Pre-mode is activated by the “Load cutout OFF” signal (e.g. in response to opening of 
the door or unlocking with the radio remote control). The Pre-mode then stays set for 16 
minutes and is restarted with a change in status. 

The ride height of the vehicle is monitored and evaluated with a wide tolerance band. 

In Pre-mode, the vehicle is only controlled up to the nominal height if the level is signifi¬ 
cantly below the nominal height. This control tolerance ensures that the vehicle is only 
controlled up in the case of large loads in order to increase the ground clearance prior to 
departure. Small loads give rise to small compression travel and this is compensated only 
when the engine is started. This control setting helps to reduce the battery load.

* Average figure 

With single-axle air suspension, the vehicle is controlled down when the mean value of 
both ride height signals is > 0 mm and one side is in excess of + 10 mm. 

In this mode, only the mean value of the two ride height signals (fast filter) is considered 
when deciding whether there is a need fora control operation. 

There is no inclination detection in Pre-mode. 

Normal Mode 

Normal mode is the starting point for the vehicle’s normal operating state. It is obtained 
by way of the “Engine running” signal. 

Levelling is possible. The compressor starts up as reguired. 


Coding parameter 

Value 

niv_normal_up_e 

- 09 mm 

niv_normal_up_d 

- 07 mm 

niv_normal_down_e 

+ 09 mm 

niv_normal_down_d 

+ 07 mm 


A narrower tolerance band than that in Pre-mode can be used because the battery 
capacity does not have to be protected. The fast filter is used with a narrow tolerance 
band of ± 10 mm. In this way, ride level compensation takes place outside a narrow toler¬ 
ance band of ± 10 mm. The faster filter allows the system to respond immediately to 
changes in ride level. Evaluation and control are performed separately for each wheel. 


52 

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 




When a speed signal is detected, the EHC control unit switches into Drive mode. When 
the vehicle is stopped, the EHC control unit remains in Drive mode. The system switches 
back into Normal mode only when a door or the luggage compartment lid is also opened. 
If none of the doors or the luggage compartment lid is opened, the vehicle logically can¬ 
not be loaded or unloaded. 

This prevents a control operation happening when the vehicle is, for example, stopped at 
traffic lights and the ride height is above the mean value due to a possible pitching 
motion at the rear axle. 


Drive Mode 

Drive mode for the single-axle air suspension is activated when a speed of > 1 km/h is 
detected.

niv_drive_up_d 

- 05 mm 

niv_drive_down_e 

+ 09 mm 

niv_drive_down_d 

+ 07 mm 


Low-pass filters are used. In this way, only changes in ride height over a prolonged period 
of time (1000 seconds) are corrected. These are merely the changes in ride height, 
caused by vehicle compression and a reduction in vehicle mass due to fuel consumption. 
The high-pass filter (fast filter) is used during the control operation. The slow filters are 
reinitialized at the end of the control operation. The markedly dynamic height signals 
caused by uneven road surfaces are filtered out.

Coding parameter 

Value 

niv_delta_kerb_e

The Kerb mode prevents the inclination caused by the vehicle mounting an obstacle with 
only one wheel from being compensated. Compensation would cause a renewed inclina¬ 
tion of the vehicle and result in a renewed control operation after the wheel came off the 
obstacle. 


53 

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 




Kerb mode is activated if the difference in height between the left and right-hand side of 
the vehicle is > 24 mm and is present for longer than 0.9 seconds. No speed signal may 
be present for this mode to be set. The system switches from single-wheel control to axle 
control. 

Kerb mode is quit if the difference between the left and right-hand side of the vehicle is 
< 28 mm and this difference remains for longer than 0.9 seconds or if the speed is 
> 1 km/h. 

If the system switches from Kerb mode to Sleep mode, this status is stored in the EEP- 
ROM. 

If the vehicle is being loaded or unloaded in Kerb mode, the EHC control unit calculates 
the mean value for the axle from the changes in ride height determined from the spring 
travel on the right and left-hand side. 

A change in ride level is initiated if the mean value of compression or rebound at the axle 
is outside the tolerance band of ± 10 mm. The left and right sides of the vehicle are 
raised or lowered in parallel. The height difference between the two sides is maintained. 

Curve 

Since rolling motions have a direct impact on the measured ride levels, an unwanted con¬ 
trol operation would be initiated during longer instances of cornering with an appropriate 
roll angle in spite of the slow filtering of the Drive mode. The control operations during 
cornering would cause displacement of the air volume from the outer side to the inner 
side of the curve. Once the curve is completed, this would produce an inclination which 
would result in a further control operation. Curve mode prevents that adjustment by stop¬ 
ping slow filtering when cornering is detected and cancelling any adjustment that may 
have been started. 

Curve mode is activated upwards a lateral acceleration of > 2 m/s2 and deactivated at < 

1.0 m/s2. The lateral acceleration is recorded by the DSC sensor.

This mode is detected when the permitted rebound travel at one or more wheels is 
exceeded > 55 mm. A jacking situation is also detected and the ride height stored if the 
lowering speed drops below the level of 2 mm/ s for 1 second. 

If the vehicle is raised only slightly and the permitted rebound travel has not yet been 
reached, the control operation attempts to readjust the ride height. If the vehicle is not 
lowered, a carjack situation is recognized after a specific period of time and this ride 
height is stored. 

A reset is performed if the vehicle is again 10 mm below this stored ride height. 

Special Modes (Transport, Belt) 

Transport mode is set and cancelled by means of diagnostics control. It serves to 
increase the ground clearance in order to ensure safe transportation of vehicles on trans¬ 
porter trucks. The nominal height of the vehicle is raised in this mode by 30 mm. 

When Transport mode is activated, the air suspension symbol is lit on the variable indica¬ 
tor lamp on the instrument cluster and a message is shown on the Check Control display 
to alert the driver to this special mode. 

Control operations do not take place in this mode because the vehicle mass does not 
change during transportation. 

Belt mode is set during assembly in the works to prevent control operations. 

When Belt mode is activated, the air suspension symbol is lit in the variable indicator 
lamp in the instrument cluster and a message is output in the Check Control display to 
alert the driver to this special mode. 

Production-line mode is cleared by means of diagnostics control only. The Belt mode can 
no longer be set. 

New EHC control units (spare part) are supplied with Belt mode set. 

Control operations are not performed, the safety concept only operates with limited 
effect.

Method of Operation 

Initialization/reset behavior 

Different checks and initializations are carried out when the EHC control unit is powered 
up after a reset (triggered by an undervoltage or also by load cutout off VA_AUS). 

The system is only enabled after the tests have been successfully completed and starts 
to execute the control programs on a cyclical basis. Occurring faults are stored and dis¬ 
played. 

Control sequence 

In an ongoing control operation, the high-pass filter (fast filter) is always used to prevent 
the controlled height from overshooting the specified setting. 

If a low-pass filter (slow filter) were used to calculate the ride height, brief changes of ride 
height would be “absorbed”. 

The low-pass filter is used when the vehicle is in motion (see Normal mode) to filter out 
vibrations induced by prevailing road conditions on this basis of this method of filtering. 

The high-pass filter is used to respond quickly to ride level deviations from setpoint. 
These take place while the vehicle is stationary in the event of large load changes (see 
Pre-mode). 


Both sides of the vehicle are controlled individually, i.e. even the setpoint/actual-value 
comparison for both sides is carried out individually. 

Exception: check for falling below the minimum height in Pre-mode and Kerb mode. 

The left/right mean values are taken into consideration here. The following stipulations 
are applicable here: 

• Raising or lowering 

• All valves controlled with control in the same direction 

• Individual wheel deactivation 

To ensure reliable closing of the non-return valve in the air drier, the exhaust valve is oper¬ 
ated briefly for 200 ms by the EHC control unit after each control sequence. 

The permissible ON period is monitored while performing upward adjustment operations. 


57 

F01 Vertical Dynamics Systems 



Safety concept 

The safety concept is intended to inhibit any system malfunction, particularly unintention¬ 
al control operations, through the monitoring of signals and function-relevant parameters. 

If faults are detected, the system is switched over or shut down depending on the com¬ 
ponents concerned. The driver is informed of any faults by the display, and detected 
faults are stored for diagnostic purposes. 

In order to ensure high system availability, existing faults, as far as possible, are cleared 
with terminal 15 ON. 

This is done by resetting the logistics counter to zero. However, the fault memory content 
in the EEPROM is retained and can be read out for diagnostic purposes. The system is 
then operational again. Fast fault detection means that existing faults are detected before 
control operations can take place. 

Only lowering is permitted if: 

• the power supply voltage drops below the permissible minimum of 9 volts. 

• the permissible compressor duty periods, and therefore compressor temperatures, 
based on a temperature duty period algorithm* are exceeded. 

A reset is carried out if the voltage is within the reguired range of 9 to 16 volts or after 
expiry of the compressor pause period of approximately 100 seconds. 

Only raising is permitted if: 

• The permissible control down period of 40 seconds is exceeded. 

• The reset takes place the next time the vehicle is driven or after the next 
control-up procedure. 

No control if: 

• The permissible supply voltage of 16 volts is exceeded. 

The reset takes place as soon as the voltage is within the reguired range. 


* Temperature duty period algorithm: 

In order to prevent overheating problems when the compressor is running or when outside 
temperatures are very high, a temperature duty period algorithm has been implemented. 

Tstart (starting temperature) is assumed from the coil resistance of the exhaust valve and the 
theoretical temperature change is calculated on the basis of the change in coil resistance.

The EHC control unit receives the following signals: 

• Vehicle ride height 

• Load cutout signals 

• Terminal 15 ON/OFF 

• Vehicle speed 

• Lateral acceleration 

• “Engine running” signal 

• Hatch status. 

The EHC control unit decides on a case-by case basis whether a control operation is 
required in order to compensate for changes in load. 

It is thus possible to optimally adapt the frequency, specified heights, tolerance thresh¬ 
olds and battery load to the relevant situation by means of the control operation.

Lever 


The angle of a pivoting lever is converted into a voltage signal by the ride height sensor. 
The greater the angle (relative to a defined starting or zero position), the greater is the 
output voltage. It is generated by a Hall-effect sensor element. 

Designs 

There are always four ride-height sensors fitted on all F01/F02 models. 

The ride-height sensors fitted all operate according to the same principle but there are 
different designs (different part numbers). The reason for the differences are the available 
space and the starting position (zero position) of the individual ride-height sensors. 

Depending on whether or not the vehicle is fitted with Electronic Height Control (EHC), 
double or single ride-height sensors are fitted on the rear suspension. 


On the front suspension, single ride-height sensors are always used.
