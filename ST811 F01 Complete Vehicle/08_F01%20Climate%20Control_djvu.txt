F01 Climate Control 




Introduction 


The F01/F02 heating and air conditioning system has been enhanced in terms of heat¬ 
ing/cooling capacity, airflow distribution, noise and convenience when compared with the 
previous 7 Series system. 

The F01/F02 will only be available with IHKA 4 zone (IHKA with FKA). The new 4 zone 
IHKA system is similar (in operation) to the system used on E70 and E71 vehicles. 

The (IHKA) Integrated automatic climate control with rear climate control (FKA) 
is a 4-zone system. 

Regardless on the equipment option selected, all essential climate control functions 
are individually accessible by each occupant.

IHKA (4 zone) 


System Overview 

The IHKA 4 zone has an additional control panel and control unit in the rear passenger 
compartment (FKA) allowing the rear passengers full control of temperature, airflow rate 
and airflow distribution with a choice of 5 intensity levels. 

The IHKA 4 zone system is equipped with 15 stepper motors. 

There is an extra blower fan located in the center console to enhance the airflow in the 
rear passenger compartment. 

The rear footwell ducts are each fitted with a PTC heater element to warm up the outlet 
air temperature. They are individually adjusted depending on the rear passengers 
requested temperature settings. 

The rear occupants can also adjust the air temperature from the rear center air vent and 
the left and right B-pillar vents by means of two stratification adjusters (potentiometers) 
located on the rear center air vent.

System Air Flow 

The airflows through a flap between the fan motor and the climate control housing into 
the filter housing of the IHKA. 

In the filter housing, the air is filtered by two combination filters (with activated charcoal) 
whether it is fresh air or recirculated air, it then flows on to the evaporator and heater core. 

Depending on the IHKA settings and the in side and outside temperature, the air is initial¬ 
ly cooled and dried by the evaporator and, if necessary, then re-heated by the heater core 
to deliver the reguested outlet temperature.

Air Ionizer 


The air Ionizer used in the F01/F02 is the latest technical innovation in the area of heating 
and air conditioning. 

The air ionizer is positioned upstream of the evaporator and it is activated as necessary 
when the vehicle is stationary. 

By partial ionization of the air the formation of bacteria on the evaporator surface and the 
associated odor is prevented.

F01 Climate Control 


















The air ionizer is a separate component which fits onto the climate-control unit with bayo¬ 
net connection and is positioned in the air stream to the evaporator. 

It essentially consists of a planar module, a flat ceramic plate which is covered by hard 
glass with printed electrical conductors located on the front and back of the component. 



Air ionizer on F01/F02 


Applying a high voltage generated internally in the ionizer partially ionizes the air. 

The chemical reaction between the ionized air and the condensed water produces hydro¬ 
gen peroxide in the evaporator housing, which kills bacteria and germs on the evaporator 
and thus prevents the formation of unpleasant odors that could enter the vehicle interior. 

The IHKA decides when and whether to operate the air ionizer, based on the ambient 
and operating conditions of the climate control system. 

The air ionizer is operated for a period of several minutes by a control signal from the 
IHKA. 

Operation takes place as required only during the overrun period after Terminal 15 is 
turned OFF and the vehicle is locked. 

The maximum power consumption of the unit is 850 mA. 

The power supply for operating the air ionizer is through a three-pin connector on the 
climate control wiring harness. 

Communication with the IHKA control panel takes place by means of a control signal via 
a bidirectional cable connection.

IHKA Components 


To optimize the system package, promote comfort and reduce noise level in the passen¬ 
ger compartment, the blower fan for the climate control system has now been placed in 
the engine compartment.

Coolant Circuit of the Heating System 

The F01/F02 IHKA system is a coolant regulated system. The coolant circuit uses a dou¬ 
ble solenoid heater control valve to control the temperature of the heater core. 

Note: The N63 engine uses a mechanical water pump.

A/C Compressor 

The system uses a variable displacement AC compressor with a magnetic clutch. 
Refrigerant pressure and flow are varied as the displacement of the compressor 
changes in response to the electronic control valve.

AUC Sensor 


The AUC sensor is located next to the fresh air intake. The fresh air is drawn in through 
the cowl between windshield and hood and passes through a coarse filter in the climate 
control fan housing before entering the system.

IHKA Front Control Unit Panel 

The control panel and control unit of the climate control system on the F01/F02 is incor¬ 
porated in the audio systems control panel. 



The driver and front passenger can select separate automatic programs. 

In order to be able to cater for the different heating/air conditioning preferences the auto¬ 
matic mode on the F01/F02 climate control offers a choice of 5 different levels of intensi¬ 
ty for the automatic program. 

Automatic mode is activated by pressing the AUTO button. 

The intensity level is selected by repeatedly pressing the “Fan speed” rocker button 
when Automatic mode is active. 

The “ALL” button can be used to synchronize the temperature, AUTO mode intensity or 
air flow rate and airflow distribution settings for all 4 zones with the settings for the driver. 

The Residual feature is similar to the E70 in that it is operated by pressing the HIGH side 
of the driver’s fan speed button.

The 4-zone system has four control points for individually adjusting the climate control 
settings. 

The rear passengers can adjust the temperature separately for the left and right sides. 

The automatic program with its 5 intensity settings can also be selected in the rear seats. 

As for the front seats, the intensity level in automatic mode for the rear passengers is 
selected and set by pressing the fan rocker button.
