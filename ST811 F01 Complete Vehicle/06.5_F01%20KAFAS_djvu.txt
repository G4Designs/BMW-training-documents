Introduction 


Multifunction Video Camera 

With the F01/F02, the customer is able to choose from a comprehensive range of 
optional driver assistance systems. 

The individual systems and function units are becoming ever more densely networked 
as a result of the shared use of components and signals in some areas. 

Depending on the combination of the available options installed, the functions in the 
F01/F02 are implemented as camera-based systems, both sharing the same camera 
and the one control unit, the KAFAS control unit. 

KAFAS is the Camera Assisted Driver Assistance System. 

KAFAS is used for the following combined functions: 

• Lane departure warning 

• High-beam assistant.

F01 KAFAS 































FLA (high beam assistant) is part of the ZDA Driver Assistance Package option and will 
not be available separately on the F01/F02. 

The ZDA Driver Assistance Package option includes the following: 

• High-beam Assistant 

• Lane Departure Warning 

• Active Blind Spot Detection 

The vehicle comes fitted with the KAFAS control unit and camera. The high-beam assis¬ 
tant option shares the KAFAS camera and the KAFAS control unit with the lane departure 
warning system.

Functional Principle 


Lane Departure Warning 

The lane departure warning causes the steering wheel to vibrate to warn the driver that 
the vehicle is threatening to leave the current lane without driver intending it to do so. 
The prerequisite for this function to work is the presence of road or lane markings that 
can be recognized by the control unit based on an evaluation of the images recorded by 
the forward facing video camera. 

The system is therefore intended to assist the driver in case of a lapse of attention. 
Nevertheless, the driver continues to bear full responsibility for the vehicle. 

The system is designed to assist the driver on highways, major roads and well main¬ 
tained country roads. Warnings are given, therefore, only at speeds of over 44 mph. 

The driver activates the system using the lane departure warning button in the BEFAS 
driver assistance control panel.

The “system ON” state is indicated in the instrument cluster and, where applicable, in the 
head-up display by the following symbol. 



Lane departure warning switched on 


The activated system is ready as soon as lane markings are detected by the control unit 
and the vehicle is travelling faster than 44 mph. 

The ready state of the system is represented by additional arrow symbols in the display.

F01 KAFAS 




If the vehicle threatens to drive over a lane marking and leave the lane without the driver 
intending it to do so, the driver is alerted by a vibrating of the steering wheel. 

The lane departure warning senses an intentional change of lane made by the driver from 
the activation of the turn signal. In this case there is no warning when the vehicle is driven 
over the lane marking.

Lane Detection 



F01/F02 Lane departure warning video camera 


The lane departure warning video camera integrated into the base of the rear-view mirror 
on the windshield monitors the area ahead of the vehicle. The video camera captures the 
roadway up to approximately 131 ft. to the front of the vehicle and up to approximately 5m/ 
16.4 ft to the right and left. 

The image data is sent to the KAFAS control unit along an LVDS data line for analysis. 
Using image processing technology, the control unit scans the images recorded by the 
video camera for lane and roadway markings. 

The software in the control unit also checks which lane markings apply to the 
current lane in which the vehicle is driving. 

First, the control unit calculates the vehicle’s position relative to the lanes detected in the 
camera images and then uses this position as basis for converting the data into a lane 
departure warning. 

The fundamental parameters for this calculation are the road speed and steering angle of 
the vehicle. 


15 

F01 KAFAS 








Roadway Marking 

The roadway markings in the image may differ greatly depending on the country, type of 
road or prevailing environmental conditions. The system is capable of recognizing a wide 
range of roadway markings and types of marking. 

An analysable lane marking is subject to unequivocal recognition by the video camera 
and control unit first. The lane traveled must have an average width of at least 2.5m. 

Physical Limitations of the Optical System 

The lane departure warning functions under a wide range of different environmental con¬ 
ditions. 

Due to the physical limitations of the system, system availability may be affected by 
specific road and environmental conditions, such as snow, fog, rain, or glare and dazzle. 

Display and Control Concept 

The lane departure warning can be switched on as of terminal 15 ON. 

When the ignition is switched on, the lane departure warning system always reverts to the 
state that was active when the vehicle was last switched off. 

Provided lanes can be detected, the lane departure warning is “primed” (ready) above a 
speed of 40 mph.

Warning 

The active system is ready whenever the prerequisites for a lane departure warning have 
been fulfilled: Lane detected and V > 40 mph. 

If the vehicle threatens to drive over the lane marking, the system warns the driver by 
causing the steering wheel to vibrate. 

Based on the detection of one or two lanes, the system first calculates the 
position of the vehicle in relation to these lanes. 

Using the vehicle’s steering angle and road speed, the system calculates the time (t) 
remaining before the vehicle would cross the lane marking. 

The warning is output in time before the vehicle crosses the marking.

19 

F01 KAFAS 




F01/F02 Lane departure warning 


A warning is output only once on approach to a roadway marking. The warning lasts a 
maximum of 2.5s. No more warnings are output if the vehicle then continues to drive 
along the lane marking. 

A new warning can only be issued if the vehicle has been steered back into the lane or 
the vehicle has completed a change of lane. 

No warning is given if the control unit has received an input signal indicating the activation 
of the turn signals because this signal announces that the driver is about to change lane 
intentionally. 

Similarly, no warning is given if the hazard warning lights are switched on. 

The warning ends when: 

• The driver steers back into the lane 

• A lane change is completed 

• The vehicle drives along the line for longer than 2.5 seconds 

• The turn signal is operated to indicate a change of lane 

• The brake pedal is depressed with force (brake-pressure-dependent).

Signal path for controlling the vibration actuator 

Control of the vibration actuator in the steering wheel is initiated by the KAFAS control 
unit in interaction with the ZGM, ICM and SZL. 

The ICM is always included in the control of the vibration actuator so that, in vehicles 
equipped with both the optional lane change warning and the lane departure warning, the 
driver is able to distinguish between the warnings of these similar systems.

The fundamental prerequisites for system activation and ready state are: 

• Road speed higher than 40 mph. 

• Left lane, right lane or both lanes are detectable by the system with a 
sufficient level of certainty. 

The local roadway markings, environmental conditions and the physical limitations 
of an optical system must all be taken into consideration 

• The lane departure warning system has been calibrated correctly 
(see “Service information”). 

• There is no fault in the system. 


High-beam Assistant 


The high-beam assistant (FLA) assists the customer in the use of the high-beam head¬ 
lights. Depending on the traffic situation, the prevailing ambient light conditions and 
which lights on the vehicle have been switched on, the FLA switches on the high-beam 
headlights automatically and thereby relieves the customer of having to switch the high- 
beam headlights on manually. 


High-beams can still be switched on and off manually as usual. The driver always has the 
capability, and indeed the obligation, to override the system whenever the situation 
requires it.

In the F01/F02, the high-beam assistant option is implemented differently depending on 
the equipment combination. 

In combination with the lane departure warning, the high-beam assistant function shares 
the same video camera and the same KAFAS control unit.

Operation and Indication 


In order for the driver to be able to activate and use the high-beam assistant, the light 
switch must first be set to Automatic or light switch position II. 

In the F01/F02, the high-beam assistant has its own activation button in the turn signal/ 
high-beam stalk on the steering column. 

While the high-beam assistant can be activated at anytime with the light switch in posi¬ 
tion II, there is an additional prerequisite in the Automatic position whereby the automatic 
driving lights controller must have already switched on the lights.

Detection of Light in the Field of View of the Video Camera 

The video cameras monitor the area ahead of the vehicle for light sources. Vehicles 
travelling in front and oncoming traffic become recognizable at distances of up to approxi¬ 
mately 400m/437yd. The detection range of the video camera is approximately 
1,000m/1093yd. The video camera has a horizontal viewing angle of approximately 15° to 
the left and right and a vertical viewing angle of approximately 5° up and down. 

When active, these special video cameras capture dots of light and, in the process, are 
able to distinguish between various parameters, e.g. light color and light intensity.

Evaluation of Image Data 

The various dots, colors and intensities of light captured by the camera are evaluated by 
the control unit and, based on the control unit’s assessment, a switch-on or switch-off 
recommendation is sent from the KAFAS control unit to the footwell module. 

In addition to the switch-on/switch-off recommendation, road speed is also taken into 
account. 

At speeds below 24mph, the FLA is switched off; at speeds higher than 31 mph, it may 
be switched on, depending on all other parameters. 

If the vehicle is in an environment with adequate light, the high-beam headlights do not 
switch on. The KAFAS control unit sends a switch-off recommendation to the footwell 
module. 

These conditions could be: 

• Daylight 

• Twilight 

• Road lighting 

• Illuminated places 

The system is designed to switch off the high-beam headlights automatically in response 
to the following conditions. 

• Oncoming traffic 

• Preceding traffic 

• Detection of background brightness 
(twilight, street lamps, illuminated places, etc.) 

• Driving speed too low 


28 

F01 KAFAS 



Control of the High-beam Headlights 

At the request of the FLA (KAFAS) control unit, the actual switching on and off of the 
high-beam headlights is always carried out by thefootwell module, which is responsible 
for all of the exterior lighting. 

The FLA control unit uses its own image data to assess background brightness. 

The decision of the FRM to activate the dipped-beam headlights in A mode is made in 
the FRM independently of the FLA function. The FRM receives the light signal from the 
RLSS. 


System limitations 

In various situations, and under specific environmental conditions, the limitations of a 
camera-based system begin to impact on functionality. 

These limitations may be reached in the following situations. 

• Extremely bad weather conditions (e.g. fog or heavy snowfall). 

• Poorly illuminated road users (e.g. riders on small motorcycles, cyclists, pedestrians). 

• Individual driving situations (e.g. sharp bends, steep hills, traffic coming at right 
angles from left or right). 

• Differentiation between different light sources, reflective traffic signs, etc. 

• No recognition of oncoming traffic is possible if only the cone of light is within the 
video camera’s field of view. 


Recognition is possible only if the light source itself is within the field of view of the 


video camera. 


The driver is able to intervene at any time and override the assistance system by switch¬ 
ing the high-beam headlights on and off manually. 

The driver always bears sole responsibility for the vehicle and the control of the vehicle’s 
lighting.

Service Information 


Lane Departure Warning 

The lane departure warning can be ordered has been available: 

• Since 03/07 in the 

-E60 
- E61 and 

• Since 09/07 in the 

-E63 

-E64 

In the event of a replacement of components, the different features of the variants as 
described in the parts catalogue, and the instructions for the necessary coding and cali¬ 
bration routines stored in the diagnostics and programming system must be observed. 

You will also find information on the lane departure warning in the “E60/E61 Lane depar¬ 
ture warning” training Information. 

High-beam Assistant 

The high beam assistant was introduced for the first time in the E60, E61, E63 LCI, E64 
LCI BMW models from 2007 Model Year. 

The high-beam assistant is not available separately for the F01/F02 and is part of the 
ZDA Driver Assistance Package option. 

Low-sensitivity Mode 

A low-sensitivity mode has been implemented in order to comply with the US statutory 
requirements. In this mode, the sensors are less sensitive. 

To activate this mode, the driver must press the turn signal stalk on the steering column 
forwards for 10 seconds with the vehicle stationary, the lights switched off and terminal 
15 ON. 

As soon as the high-beam assistant is activated, the driver receives a Check Control 
message indicating that low-sensitivity mode is active. 

The high-beam assistant reverts to its basic state following a power cycle.
