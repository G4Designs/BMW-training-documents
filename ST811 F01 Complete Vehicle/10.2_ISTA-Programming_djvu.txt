ISTA-Programming 




Introduction 


Reasons for introduction of the new programming system 

Due to the constantly growing complexity and ongoing development of functions over 
the life of vehicles, adaptation of the software on the control units is unavoidable. 

The launch of the F01 brings with it a new generation of vehicles which have not only 
new functions but also a new control unit architecture and a new electrical system con¬ 
figuration. 

In order to ensure that those technologies can be supported by the dealer organization 
today and in the future, a new workshop system is being introduced alongside them. 

The new workshop system incorporates an extensive workshop network with a central 
server for data storage and provision of the applications. It also introduces new hardware 
components for diagnosis and programming. 

The existing programming system, Progman, is being replaced by the Integrated Service 
Technical Application for Programming, ISTA/R 

ISTA/P contains the present vehicle field programming functions plus new functions and 
is thus designed for the future content and requirements of vehicle programming in the 
field.

ISTA-Programming 




New features when comparing ISTA/P with Progman 

• Reduction and combination of input demands. 

• Configurable measures plan viewable as a graphical chart 
or a table. 

• Detailed display of control unit status. 

• Automatic repetition of programming in the event of control unit programming or 
coding errors within the programming process. 

• Importing of enabling codes/vehicle order from any location in the workshop provid¬ 
ed there is access to the workshop system/ISTA/R 

• Measures plan can be subsequently extended and adapted. 

• Programming takes place first followed by automatic coding of all control units. 

• Proactive saving of customization and CBS data and re-importing into control units 
from F01 on. 

• Saving of personal profile settings such as phone book or navigation destinations, 
depending on control units fitted. 

• Generation of a control unit order list if hardware needs to be replaced. 

• Session can be saved if parts are not immediately available. 

• Display of the Progman or ISTA/P version that was last used to program the vehicle. 

• Timely/faster updates.

ISTA-Programming 




Release Phases 

The new programming system ISTA/P is to be introduced in several phases. 

Phase 1 

Phase 1 requires the transformation of the Software Service Station, SSS, into the 
Integrated Software Service Station, ISSS. This “Phase 1 ”, allows the ISSS to be 
integrated in the ISIS network. 

The actual data/software (ISTA/P application) needed to program the vehicles is installed 
in the will be on the ISSS. Updates will be applied to the ISIS via Jetstream or from DVD 
and then passed on to the ISSS during the maintenance cycles (off-business hours). 

ISTA/P is capable of programming and coding all models. 

Initially, the interface and control for programming can only take place by using keyboard 
and mouse on the ISSS. Soon after, programming control can take place via each individ¬ 
ual ISID in the workshop. 

The ICOM A and the ICOM B will be used as vehicle interface for programming. 

The ICOM B will be used exclusively for programming MOST control units. 

From the introduction of the ethernet connection in the OBD2 interface, ICOM B 
will not be used, (example: F01/F02) 



Illustration of Phase 1 


Future Phases 

It is planned to integrate the programming system ISTA/P entirely in the ISIS workshop 
server. A precise timetable for integration of ISTA/P in ISIS has not yet been established.

ISTA-Prog ramming 



































Transforming an SSS into an ISSS 


The technical requirements for conversion demand that the SSS is at least the 2nd gen¬ 
eration (release 2). The 1 st generation SSS can not be converted. 


A starter pack containing the following items will 
be needed: 

• ISSS - basic DVD (1 disc) 

• ISIS - ISTA/P client (1 disc) 

• ISIS ISTA/P data/software (2 disc) 

First, the basic DVD is placed in the DVD drive 
on the SSS and the operating system installed 
on the SSS. In the process, the previous applica¬ 
tion, Progman, is completely deleted. From this 
point on, future, updates and installation of the 
ISTA/P application on the ISSS will take place 
exclusively via the ISIS. 



The ISTA/P client and then application software are installed on the ISIS. The ISSS is 
updated/supplied with the application software by the ISIS via the network during the 
maintenance cycle. 


Programming 


As a fundamental rule, a vehicle may only be programmed in the following circumstances: 

• If a diagnosis system test module instructs that programming is to be carried out. 

• As part of a technical campaign. 

• In the course of conversions or retrofits. 

• If the BMW Group technical support (e.g. via PuMA) specifically instructs that a vehi¬ 
cle is to be programmed. 

Similar to An important factor for error-free programming is proper preparation of the vehi¬ 
cle and observance of the instructions during programming. There are special require¬ 
ments that may apply to individual vehicle models. The actions that are required for all 
models are described in the following pages. 

Note: Programming must always be preceded by carrying out a diagnosis on 
the vehicle and making sure that there are no faults on the vehicle. 
Programming must not be started before faults in the vehicle electrical 
system are ruled out. Always refer to the latest bulletins and information 
on currently known issues involving software releases.

Preparatory Measures 



Engine 

Turn off engine, ignition key turned to terminal 0 




Manual Gearbox/SMG/DKG 

- Transmission in neutral 

- Parking brake applied 


Automatic Transmission 

- Transmission in position P 

- System temperature below 80°C 


Parking Brake 

On vehicles with electromechanical parking brake, apply the 
parking brake by means of the parking brake button, otherwise 
use the handbrake. 


Electric Loads 

All electric loads, lights and turn indicator switched off. 

Wiper/washer system switched off. Make sure that the wipers 
can move freely. 

The wipers may be activated during programming. On no 
account block the wipers. 


7 

ISTA-Prog ramming 


























Battery and Battery Charger 

The battery should be sufficiently charged at the start of the pro¬ 
gramming procedure (>13 V). 

Connect a BMW-specified and approved battery charger and set 
to external power supply mode (FSV mode). Do not connect or 
disconnect the charger during programming. The electrical system 
voltage must not drop below 13 volts during the programming 
procedure. 



Diagnosis 

Carry out a vehicle test on the ISTA workshop system. 

Using the ISTA diagnosis system, rectify any problems before 
programming and delete stored fault codes. 


_ 



Interfaces 

Programming is performed exclusively via the ICOM devices. 



Any vehicle equipped with a MOST bus manufactured before the 
F01/F02, will require the use of an ICOM A and an ICOM B. 


Programming 

CKM data is automatically saved by ISTA/P and written back to the 
control unit after programming. 

The data status of the ISSS must always be up to date. 


8 

ISTA-Prog ramming 






























Programming of Control Units 

The programming system ISTA/P ensures updating of the data statuses on all vehicles by 
automatically generating a measures plan that should be implemented on vehicles that 
are bound to an i-level status. 

In this context, a distinction is made between three different options. Each of these 
options represents a change or adaptation to the software and functions. A distinction 
is made between three measures: 

• Programming 

• Coding 

• Customizing 

Programming 

Programming (also known as flash programming) loads a new program or data in the 
control unit. A distinction can be made between control units with: 

• Program status and 

• Program and data status 

The program status of the control unit corresponds to the operating system and controls 
the computer program in the control unit. The data status involves the characteristic 
maps and characteristic curves specific to the vehicle, engine and transmission. The 
ISTA/P programming application automatically takes that into account when programming 
the control unit concerned. 

With ISTA/R the control unit has been programmed, any necessary coding procedures 
are performed automatically. 

Coding 

Coding involves adapting the control units to the specific vehicle. That means that func¬ 
tions and data maps already in the control modules are enabled or activated in accor¬ 
dance with the vehicle order for the vehicle.

ISTA-Programming 



Customizing 

On older vehicles, the car and key memory (CKM) option located under the Vehicle 
option is used to enter the customer-specific settings for the car and key memory func¬ 
tions on certain electrical systems.

Starting Programming 

Essentially, ISTA/P is an independent external application that will run on the ISSS in 
Phase 1. 

Although in a latter stage ISTA/P can be started from the ISID, it is entirely independent of 
the ISTA diagnosis application. That means that before programming can be started, 
diagnosis must be ended or interrupted. 

Starting and management of a new programming session can only be carried out by 
means of ISTA/R 

When ISTA/P is started, the user has a choice of three different actions: 

• Cancel and exit ISTA/P 

• Open an existing programming session 

• Start a new programming session

Opening an Existing Programming Session 

If the user decides to open an existing programming session, all the programming ses¬ 
sions currently in progress are listed and the user can select the session required. 

On the toolbar there are various buttons for opening more menus. 

On the options bar, you can select the session or the vehicle that is to be programmed 
or the Integrated Software Service Station (ISSS) that is to be used for programming. 
Depending on the vehicles models connected, each ISSS can carry out up to five pro¬ 
gramming sessions at the same time. 

On the function bar is the button for selecting the vehicle access method. 

The information panel shows the details of the sessions or available ICOMs. 

The control buttons are used to navigate through the programming process, 
e.g. the "Next" button takes you to the next screen.

Starting a New Programming Session 

When a new programming session is to be started, the programming server on which the 
vehicle is to be programmed must first be selected. 

The ISSS used for the session can be selected manually or automatically. Because the 
ISSS can only program one F01 at a time or 5 other vehicles at a time, it is recommend¬ 
ed that the automatic ISSS selection is carried out.

The connection manager on the ISIS establishes all the ICOMs that are available and dis¬ 
plays the details. The user can select the desired ICOM or vehicle from the list displayed. 
ISTA/P then establishes the vehicle data. If that is not possible for any reason, the vehicle 
must be selected manually.

The user then has the opportunity to give the session any individual name, but the sys¬ 
tem automatically enters the model of the vehicle along with the chassis number as an 
identifier (example: E60_EE12345).

ISTA-Prog ramming 


























Selecting Vehicle Interface 

The same vehicle interfaces are used for programming with the new workshop system as 
for diagnosis. 

From the F01 on, all control units can be programmed using only the ICOM A. Even 
though the F01/F02 is eguipped with a MOST bus, ICOM B is not necessary due to the 
ethernet connection via the OBD2 connector. 

For CAN-bus vehicles the ICOM A is used. MOST control units are programmed directly 
using the ICOM B. The ICOM B is connected to the ICOM A and the workshop network 
by a USB cable. 

For older l-bus/K-bus vehicles with the round diagnosis connector, the ICOM C (C) is 
used in conjunction with the ICOM A.

Vehicle Access for MOST Bus 

When programming vehicles with MOST bus from E65 to E9X, vehicle access is estab¬ 
lished as shown in the photograph below. 



Vehicle access for programming MOST-bus vehicles 


Vehicle Access for l-bus/K-bus Vehicles 

On older vehicles without OBD II connection, programming is carried out via the round 
diagnosis connector in the engine compartment. That requires connecting the ICOM C 
to the ICOM A and to the workshop network.

Identifying the vehicle and obtaining a read-out of control unit data 

ISTA/P checks the vehicle electrical system, the central gateway and the vehicle-order 
control units (FRM/CAS/light module). The vehicle order is read and a consistency check 
carried out between the actual status and the required status. 

If the central gateway does not respond, a software routine for restoring it to working 
order is attempted before the service technician is instructed to replace the ZGW. 

First of all, the basic details of the vehicle are established such as VIN number, model, 
type code, etc. 

Then, all control units fitted and the current l-level of the vehicle is determined. In addi¬ 
tion, the programming system establishes, if possible, the software version last used to 
carry out servicing operations on the vehicle. 

That makes it possible to avoid unnecessary programming if the vehicle already has the 
latest software version. 

Afterwards, the details of the ex-works equipment options for the vehicle stored on the 
BMW programming system are retrieved. 

Next, the control units identified and the equipment options fitted are compared (compar¬ 
ison of required vs. actual status). 

For example, it is established whether the list of control units obtained actually matches 
those fitted on the vehicle and whether the level matches the current required status. 

That ensures that all control units on the vehicle communicate properly with one another 
within the network. An l-level is a combination of networked control units validated and 
approved by BMW Development.

Producing and Configuring the Measures Plan 

Before programming can be carried out, the measures plan is produced and can also be 
configured by the user. For example, it is now possible to program refits or conversions at 
the same time as the software update. The configuration for that is done now so that no 
further manual input is required later on during the programming sequence and it can 
then run automatically. 

After the identification process, the user is asked if any control units have been replaced 
on the vehicle. If the answer is YES, ISTA/P checks whether an enabling code is required 
for the replaced control unit and, if so, requests it from the user if it has not already been 
entered on the system.

Associated customization data such as settings for the air conditioning are backed up 
and the action "Follow up control unit replacement" added to the list of actions. 

In general it is advisable to manually back up the customer's individual settings. If the 
control unit is defective, they can not be read and, therefore, can not be written back to 
the control unit after programming either. 

The necessary actions, such as "Update control unit software", are established and 
added to the list of actions. 

Then for the first time ISTA/P produces an measures plan based on the tasks in the list of 
actions at that point. 


20 

ISTA-Prog ramming 































The user has the option of editing the measures plan. The user can add further actions to 
the measures plan but not remove them. The following actions can be added to the mea¬ 
sures plan: 

• Carry out conversion 

• Prepare control unit replacement 

• Program control unit 

• Code control unit 

• Set CKM data 


• Enter enabling code 

• Import vehicle order

Guidance notes 


Furthermore, additional guidance notes can be shown, e.g. on noting the remaining life of 
DME or conversion instructions for replacing control units. 

Note: The guidance notes must be acknowledged by ticking the checkboxes 
and confirmed by clicking OK. 


23 

ISTA-Prog ramming 






















































Preparing for Programming 

After confirming the measures plan, the flash programmability of the control units is first 
checked and a notification message displayed if there is a problem. Then the customiza¬ 
tion data and the CBS data is read and backed up for rewriting later on. 

If a control unit requires replacing, ISTA/P displays a message to the user indicating that 
the control unit should now be replaced. 

After replacement is confirmed, the action "Follow up control unit replacement" is flagged 
for attention later on in the process. 

ISTA/P then shows all required notifications, which must be acknowledged by the user 
before the actual programming starts. 

That simultaneously starts the automatic programming process which requires no further 
interaction on the part of the user. 

Note: As always, please keep in mind that the CAS is programmed first with 
the key removed. After successfully programmed, the ignition has to 
be switched on again. 

Carrying Out Repair Tasks 

If it was established in the process of identifying the vehicle that repair tasks are required, 
e.g. due to updating hardware or replacing a control unit, they are now carried out before 
the actual programming/coding process. 

If the spare part is not available or the wrong part has been ordered, the session can be 
saved and ended at this point. As soon as the right part is available, the session can be 
retrieved and continued. 

ISTA/P establishes from the measures plan which repair tasks are required and displays 
them. After successful completion of a repair task, the vehicle must be re-identified and 
any necessary software updates added to the measures plan. 

In that way the possibility of inconsistencies on the vehicle after a repair is avoided. If a 
repair task fails, the programming process is cancelled. 

Updating the Measures Plan 

After a repair task has been carried out, ISTA/P performs the vehicle identification 
process again. If it identifies irregularities, e.g. that a control unit with an older l-level sta¬ 
tus has been fitted, appropriate actions are automatically set on the system or indicated 
to the user. 

If there are irregularities, ISTA/P establishes which software updates are required based 
on compatibility management and adds them to the action plan. The measures plan is 
then updated and programming automatically started. 

To prevent vehicles with inconsistencies being created, the user has no means of stop¬ 
ping the programming sequence.

ISTA-Programming 



Carrying Out Programming 

This stage of the process involves the programming and subsequent coding of the con¬ 
trol units. 

In the process of programming or coding a particular control unit, the system checks in 
each case whether the operation has succeeded before continuing with the program¬ 
ming of further control units. A particular version of ISTA/P distributes only one l-level. 
Programming of the vehicle as a whole (meaning all control units on the vehicle) is always 
performed to the latest l-level (target l-level). 

The next step is to write the enabling codes to the relevant control units if required and 
modifying the vehicle order if conversions have been carried out. The programming of 
control units can also be performed simultaneously if they are on different bus systems, 
e.g. MOST and CAN. 

The progress of the programming process is indicated by a progress bar. 



Carrying out programming View after completion of programming 


If programming/coding/initialization has been completed successfully, there is a green tick 
by every control unit on which an action has been performed. 


If an action has failed or not been completed, the control unit concerned 
is marked with a red X. 

By clicking the control unit concerned, you can obtain information as to 
why programming failed.

Completing Programming Session 

The last stage of the programming process is importing the customization, CBS and 
CKM data. The data is written back to the control units and checked. Afterwards, the 
automated initialization sequences are performed where required (electric win¬ 
dows/slide/tilt sunroof). 

The automatic programming process is them complete. The initialization sequences 
that require user interaction are then carried out.

Notes on follow-up 


After completion of the initialization sequences, ISTA/P establishes from the measures 
plan what service functions are required, e.g. setting steering angle. They are shown to 
the user. They have to be carried out as part of the diagnosis after programming. That is 
carried out by way of the vehicle test on the ISTA workshop system and afterwards all 
fault memories must be cleared. 

Finally, the actual status is checked once again and the final report produced. ISTA/P 
provides the user with the final report. 

The user can print out the final report or else it is stored for a certain period on the ISIS. 

The entire programming log is sent to BMW AG as part of the FASTA data. This allows 
BMW to retrace how the vehicle programming was carried out from the user actions, 
either for accounting purposes or if there is a subsequent fault. 

Furthermore, that data is automatically analysed so that software errors can be detected 
at an early stage and suitable measures initiated. As a result, BMW is able to continuously 
monitor and improve software quality.
