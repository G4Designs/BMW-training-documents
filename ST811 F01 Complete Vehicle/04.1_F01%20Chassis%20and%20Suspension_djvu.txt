New Chassis Systems for F01/02 


Through intelligent design layout and optimum package space utilization on the new 
F01/F02, the basis has been created for distinctly increasing the driving dynamics while 
improving comfort and vehicle handling. 

At virtually identical wheel loads, a greater track width and a larger wheelbase have been 
realized compared to the predecessor, the E65. 

The development of the new generation chassis and suspension systems in the new 
F01/F02 focused on revolution instead of evolution. The aim was to set a new bench¬ 
mark. 

The lightweight construction philosophy was consistently pursued in the design of the 
chassis and suspension systems. This is reflected in the widespread use of aluminum, 
representing an important contribution to increasing comfort and reducing C02 emis¬ 
sions. 

For the first time, a BMW Sedan is fitted with a double wishbone front axle made of alu¬ 
minum, a steerable integral-V rear axle, BMW integral active steering (IAL) and the innov¬ 
ative damper system, the 2nd generation vertical dynamics control (VDC 2). 

The integrated chassis management (ICM) intelligently links all chassis and suspension 
control systems, thus achieving a new level of functional guality. Further highlights 
include "Dynamic Drive" (ARS) and a fully variable power steering pump to improve fuel 
economy.

Track Width 

The size of the track width at the front and rear has a decisive influence on the cornering 
characteristics of the vehicle and its tendency to roll. 

• The track width should be as large as possible, however, it cannot exceed a defined 
value in relationship to the width of the vehicle. 

• The fully deflected (spring compressed) wheel turned at full lock on the front axle 
must not scrape or snag in the wheel arch cutout. 

• A certain degree of clearance for fitting snow chains is reguired on the drive axle 
(irrespective of whether this is the front, rear or both axles). 

• The wheels must not make contact with any chassis or body parts when the sus¬ 
pension springs fully compress and rebound. 

Wheelbase 

The wheelbase -measured from the center of the front axle to the center of the rear axle 
has a decisive influence on the vehicle handling properties. 

A large wheelbase compared to the length of the vehicle permits favorable accommoda¬ 
tion of the vehicle occupants between the axles and reduces the influence of the vehicle 
load on the overall load distribution. Short body overhang at the front and rear reduces 
the pitching tendency. 

A short wheelbase, on the other hand, provides favorable cornering characteristics, i.e. a 
smaller turning circle at the same steering lock angle. 

The outstandingly balanced values on the E65 result in safe, superior and agile vehicle 
handling characteristics that represent the standard in the luxury class segment also for 
the future. These technical data are the prereguisite for achieving the top position in its 
class. In terms of driving dynamics, the F01/ F02 will assume a leading position without 
forfeiting driving and rolling comfort compared to the competition (with comparable 
eguipment).

System Overview 


Front Axle 

A double wishbone front axle as known from the E70 and E71 is now also fitted in the 
F01/ F02. 

In comparison with the double pivot spring strut front axle on the E65, this front axle 
design offers the following advantages: 

• Higher transverse acceleration is reflected in greater vehicle agility. 

• Improved cornering/steering and transition characteristics which are particularly 
favourable in terms of rolling motion. 

• Reduced interference means greater comfort. 

• Shock absorbers that are subjected to virtually no transverse forces provide greater 
comfort. 

• The design layout of the double wishbone front axle facilitates vertical dynamics 
control (VDC) and all-wheel drive (as on the E70/E71) without the need to adjust 
height and no spring travel loss. 

• Double wishbone front axles improve directional stability. 

The outstanding driving dynamics, the excellent driving comfort as well as the exception¬ 
al directional stability are factors of this double wishbone front axle design solution that 
contribute to a high degree of driving pleasure and safety while making the vehicle ideal 
for every day use and providing the most relaxing drive on long journeys.

Rear Axle 


Compared to the integral IV rear axle, the further-developed integral-V rear axle in the 
F01/F02 is characterized by further improved driving dynamics without compromising 
comfort and driving safety. 

Furthermore, a “distributed” integral-V rear axle was reguired in order to realize FISR (rear 
axle slip angle control) that is a fundamental part of the integral active steering system. 

Dampers/suspension 

In the F01/F02, the range of spring/damper units extends from the steel spring with 
standard vertical dynamics control (VDC) through to the electronically controlled dampers 
that can also be combined with the single axle air spring on the rear axle. 

Brakes 

The brake system on the F01/F02 is a furtherdeveloped high performance brake system 
with newly adapted dimensions for the F01/ F02 and is dependent on the national market 
specification. The service brake is based on the conventional design, however, the park¬ 
ing brake features an electromechanical parking brake system (EMF). 

Steering 

The F01/F02 is available with two steering system variants: 

• Hydraulic servotronic 

• Integral active steering (IAL). 

Both steering systems are adapted to the varied application options of the F01/F02. 

The integral active steering is a new BMW development. 

Wheels and Tires 

In contrast to its predecessor the E65/E66, the F01/F02 is now eguipped as standard 
with a runflat safety package.

The introduction of a second control arm level for wheel control, which is arranged above 
the wheel, results in additional degrees of freedom for the kinematics of the front axle as 
well as for the suspension/damping compared to other designs such as a spring strut 
front axle. 

Components with special materials: 

• The forged aluminum swivel bearing (3) with the 3rd generation wheel bearing (4). 

Note: The arms and links are bolted by means of ball/disc connections to the 
swivel bearing and, similar to the track rod heads, no longer have 
tapered screw fittings. 

• The transverse control arm at the top (2) is made from forged aluminum and the 
cylindrical joint pin is clamped in the swivel bearing (3). 

• Tension strut with hydraulic mount (8) and lower transverse control arm (6) are 
forged aluminum components while the lower control arm bears the spring strut (1) 
by means of a forged steel mount. 

• The new front axle subframe (9) is a welded aluminum structure which, as the 
standard axle, does not reguire the familiar aluminum thrust panel with service open¬ 
ings for increasing stiffness. This is made possible by the solid transverse section in 
the front axle subframe. 

Note: The design layout of the front axle subframe makes it possible to lower 
the complete steering gear for service purposes.

Wheel center plane 




The steering pivot axis of the wheel suspension is now formed by a joint at the top A-arm 
and the virtual pivot point of the lower arm level as known from the spring strut or 
McPherson front axle. 

The steering pivot axis is therefore freely selectable and can be positioned such as to 
produce a small kingpin offset at hub with sufficient weight recoil. 

This kingpin offset at hub is decisive for transmitting the irregularities on the road surface 
to the steering wheel. The lower and upper arm levels now move simultaneously in 
response to wheel deflection. As a result, as the spring compresses, the wheel pivots in 
such a way that the negative camber to the road does not decrease as much as is the 
case with a spring strut front axle. 


10 

F01 Chassis and Suspension 












Since the two control arm levels undertake the wheel control, the damper is virtually no 
longer subjected to transverse forces and rotational motion. 

This makes it possible to do without a roller bearing assembly (conventional strut mount) 
on the spring strut support. Instead of this conventional roller bearing a damping and sup¬ 
port unit is installed that takes up all three load paths. The load paths are the damper pis¬ 
ton rod, the inner auxiliary spring and the bearing spring. This damping and support unit 
is still referred to as the “strut mount”. 

Due to the lack of transverse forces, the piston rod can be made thinner, resulting in a 
similar displacement volume in the push and pull direction of the damper. This serves to 
improve the design layout of the damper and is the prerequisite for the innovative damper 
control system - vertical dynamics control (VDC). 

Due to the substantially lower friction at the circumference of the piston rod, the damper 
can respond more sensitively. 

By connecting the stabilizer bar via the stabilizer link to the spring strut, the torsion in 
response to body roll motion is equivalent to the total wheel lift from the inside to the out¬ 
side of the curve (in other suspension setups, the stabilizer bars are connected to a trans¬ 
verse control arm and therefore achieve only a fraction of the torsion angle). Despite 
being highly effective, this high degree of torsion allows for the stabilizer bar to be made 
relatively thin which has a favorable effect on driving comfort and dynamics as well as 
saving weight.

Cast aluminium spring support (body side) 

On the E70, a cast aluminum spring support was used for the first time on the front end 
of the X Series. This assembly is now also used on the F01/F02. It offers the following 
advantages: 

• Reduced weight through intelligent lightweight construction 

• Improved driving dynamics thanks to higher degree of stiffness 

• Less components therefore reduced manufacturing expenditure. 

The cast aluminum spring support takes up the forces from the chassis and suspension 
and directs them into the car body. Both the spring strut as well as the upper transverse 
control arm are secured to the cast spring support. The component must exhibit a high 
degree of stiffness for this purpose. This is achieved by optimum material distribution by 
ensuring material is only accumulated where necessary. The spring support therefore 
represents an important contribution to controlling driving characteristics as it takes up 
both static and dynamic wheel forces. Since, with the cast construction, it is possible to 
integrate many individual functions and components in one single component, compared 
to the conventional shell construction, this setup is distinctly more compact while making 
a significant contribution to reducing weight. 

• The cast aluminum lightweight construction reduces the weight by approx. 50 % 
compared to the conventional sheet steel construction 

• More useful package space compared to conventional sheet steel construction -80 
mm shorter front end 

• Function-compliant design with specific local stiffening points adding to lightweight 
construction 

• Integration of various brackets for mounting units etc. in the cast aluminum spring 
support with add-on parts. 

The cast aluminum spring support is connected to the neighboring steel components 
(e.g. engine support) by means of a rivet-adhesion structure. The structure is of lower 
weight while making it possible to reduce the number of parts (no additional sheet metal 
brackets). Nevertheless, the vehicle body is more stable and torsionally rigid while 
increasing local stiffness. This design arrangement has a positive effect on improved 
driving dynamics. 

Service 

Note: The camber can also not be adjusted on the double wishbone front axle. 
As for the E70/ E71, two replacement upper transverse control arms are 
available for the F01/F02 should the camber need to be changed (e.g. 
after an accident). These replacement upper transverse control arms 
enable positive (+5 mm) and negative (-5 mm) correction.

Rear Axle 


Highlight in F01/F02 

The integral-V rear axle is a revolutionary further development of the integral IV rear axle 
now installed in many BMW models. 

The integral IV rear axle fulfils the primary function of the running gear and wheel control 
in a unigue way while making a significant contribution to driving dynamics characteristic 
of a BMW. 

Safety functions are defined by the superior vehicle control characteristics. Effective 
decoupling of the road and drive train guarantees outstanding levels of acoustic and 
vibration comfort. 

The further developed integral-V rear axle in the F01/F02 also provides these properties. 

In addition, the new rear axle has been specifically tuned to the new reguirements of the 
F01/F02: 

• Larger vehicle dimensions 

• Greater total weight 

• Greater drive output 

• Higher drive torgue 

• Runflat tires. 

In addition, the demanding objectives relating to driving dynamics and comfort have been 
correspondingly adapted while the new system integrates driving dynamics systems 
reguired for this purpose. 

The integral-V rear axle primarily fulfils the driving dynamics functions of the mechanical 
chassis and suspension, i.e. define elastokinematic wheel control in all relevant driving 
situations. 

The particularly innovative BMW development of the integral active steering (IAL), howev¬ 
er, makes specific demands in terms of the elastokinematics of the integral-V rear axle: 
To a certain extent, the wheels on the rear axle must be able to execute steering move¬ 
ments. 

Kinematics and elastokinematics 

The spatial arrangement of the pivot points or pivot axes of the arms and links is known 
as kinematics. This term applies to components that are assumed to be non-deformable. 

Elastokinematics takes into account the flexibility at least of the rubber-metal mounts, 
often of the ball joints and rarely of the components. 

Various arms define the horizontal plane of the rear axle wheel suspension at the axle car¬ 
rier and the wheel carrier. These arms are mounted such that they can rotate about an 
approximately horizontal axis of rotation and therefore allow vertical movement of the 
wheel carrier. 

14 

F01 Chassis and Suspension 



Kinematics is primarily of significance in terms of vehicle handling. The kinematics is 
arranged such that defined camber and toe-in angles are achieved between the wheel 
and road surface in response to the suspension and steering. 

Kinematics is superimposed by elastokinematic effects. These elastokinematic effects 
occur as the movement points and movement axes are spatially displaced by the effect of 
the forces at the wheel. 

New challenge for the integral rear axle 

In terms of the F01/F02, the new integral active steering (IAL) as a BMW driving dynam¬ 
ics innovation, posed a completely new challenge to the engineers and the tried and test¬ 
ed integral IV rearaxle.The integral active steering is made up of the active steering and 
the rear axle slip angle control (HSR).

The principle of the integral-V rear axle makes it possible to resolve the conflict between 
driving dynamics and comfort. The dynamic and drive forces applied through the wheel 
contact point into the wheel suspension are taken up by the wheel carrier, rear axle carrier, 
three links and an A-arm (swinging arm).

The design layout reduces the flexible pulling action in the wheel carrier and therefore 
enables lengthways damping of the wheel control, which is important for rolling comfort, 
by means of axially soft front link mounts on the rear axle carrier. 

Thanks to the position of the spring on the wheel carrier, it is no longer necessary to 
support the weight of the vehicle on the rubber mounts on the rear axle carrier. 

This optimum spring position in conjunction with specific lengthways control guarantees 
effective isolation of rolling and drive noise while significantly contributing to the refined 
smooth and guiet vehicle running characteristics. 


16 

F01 Chassis and Suspension 


















The main criteria that governed the selection of materials included component weight, 
production process (cold forming, casting properties, welding properties), strength and 
deformation characteristics as well as corrosion resistance. 

Two versions of the integral-V rear axle are available. Bearing assemblies are fitted on the 
two track rods if the vehicle is not eguipped with integral active steering. 

The revolutionary further development of the integral IV rear axle culminates in the BMW 
patented integral-V rear axle. The new arrangement of the arms and links as well as the 
use of ball joints facilitates a rear axle with steering capabilities.

Viewing the arrangement of the arms and links in the integral IV rear axle of the E65 it is 
difficult to imaging that defined steering movement of the rear wheels about the Z-axis 
could be realized. 


17 

F01 Chassis and Suspension 



















Theoretically, i.e. kinematically, the design of the integral IV rear axle could facilitate steer¬ 
ing capabilities, however a large actuator would be reguired that could not be accommo¬ 
dated in the package space available on the F01/F02. This would have to be designed 
considerably longer and would therefore be decisively heavier and more expensive.

The system consists of a wheel carrier that is controlled from below by a torsionally rigid 
A-arm (swinging arm). 

At the bottom, the wheel carrier is connected directly by means of a first bearing mount 
and indirectly by means of a second bearing mount, in connection with an integral link 
arranged vertically with respect to the plane of the A-arm (swinging arm), to the wheel 
carrier. 


18 

F01 Chassis and Suspension 


























The two rubber mounts on the inside of the vehicle are connected to the rear axle carrier 
such that they are torsionally soft and can be displaced axially. 

The upper transverse control arm lies approximately in the vertical plane of the drive shaft 
and therefore also at the center point of the wheel. 

The rear track rod arranged approximately at the center point of the wheel is either 
mounted on the rear axle carrier or connected to the actuator of the integral active steer¬ 
ing. 

Service 

Note: The track and camber at the rear axle can still be adjusted by means of 
two eccentric screws, however, a new procedure must be observed!

Damping/suspension 

The standard chassis and suspension system of the F01 features steel springs on the 
front and rear axle. The standard chassis and suspension on the F02 has steel springs 
on the front axle with the single axle air suspension (EHC) fitted on the rear axle. The 
F01/F02 is eguipped as standard with vertical dynamics control featuring electronically 
controlled damper systems. In addition, the following combinations are available: 

• Standard suspension with single axle air spring 

• Dynamic drive with steel springs and VDC dampers 

• Dynamic drive with 2 steel springs and single axle air spring and VDC dampers. 

BMW is the first car maker to offer as standard a continuously controlled adjusting 
damper system irrespective of tension/compression. 

The outstanding properties of this new (VDC2) adjusting damper are: 

• Advanced opening adjustment for improved body stabilization. Realized by adjust¬ 
ments even at low damper speeds. 

• Difference between “soft” and “hard” in connection with driving dynamics control 
easily identifiable by the customer. 

• Separately tuned identifier for rolling comfort through tension characteristics irre¬ 
spective of compression.

Brakes 

Function-optimized lightweight construction brakes are used on the F01/F02. 

Lightweight brake rotors with riveted aluminum hubs are installed on the front axle, while 
cast iron rotor are used on the rear axle. 

Floating brake calipers are fitted on the front and rear axle. The brake system in the F01/ 
F02 features the known brake wear monitoring system for the CBS indicator.

The frame structure of the floating caliper effectively uses the package space available in 
the wheel. 

In connection with effective brake cooling, the brake system achieves a high degree of 
thermal efficiency. The aluminum housing of the floating caliper saves weight while 
ensuring maximum operating efficiency. 

Brake disc 

The familiar riveted aluminum hub also saves weight while drastically reducing the shield¬ 
ing effect that may occur under harsh braking conditions, i.e. deformation of the brake 
disc caused by thermal material expansion. Internally ventilated brake discs are fitted on 
the front and rear axle.

The F01/F02 is eguipped with an electrically operated steering column with infinitely vari¬ 
able horizontal and vertical adjustment as standard. 


• Outstanding ergonomics ensured by an optimum adjustment range for the steering 
wheel position: 

- Horizontal ± 30 mm 

- Vertical ± 20 mm 

• Additional comfort function provided by easy entry and exit: 

- When getting in and out of the vehicle, the steering wheel temporarily moves into 
the topmost position thus providing maximum freedom of movement. 

• Outstanding crash safety provided by the familiar, innovative BMW crash system, 
specifically tuned and featuring force-dependent energy absorbers.

The steering column has a motor for in/out adjustment and a motor for up/down adjust¬ 
ment with a specially developed gear mechanism. 

Each of these low-noise drive units is mounted acoustically decoupled executes the 
adjustment with the aid of motor/driven flexible spindles. 

The components of the steering column are optimized in terms of rigidity in the comfort¬ 
relevant freguency range to reduce vibration and avoid disturbing steering wheel vibration 
and have been developed in line with a magnesium and aluminium lightweight construc¬ 
tion concept. 


The flexible coupling fitted in the steering column represents the perfect means of finely 
tuning the steering characteristics and driving comfort. Vehicle-specific loop packages 
are vulcanized in elastomer in this flexible coupling, allowing extremely high torgue to be 
transmitter reliably and precisely. The steering column is thus successfully decoupled 
from disturbing influences caused by excitation from the road surface (axial impact or radi¬ 
al torgue peaks).

The innovative crash system essentially consists of a crash adapter and crash tube. In the 
event of a crash, the impact energy is progressively reduced for the driver by the crash 
tube breaking open and deforming, thus providing the advantage of reduced stress on 
the occupants in the event of a crash (integral part of the 5-star philosophy at BMW). 

In addition, the lower and center steering shaft collapses during the crash thus preventing 
penetration of the steering column into the passenger compartment. The system design 
also prevents the back displacement of all components in the engine compartment and 
possible damage to the bulkhead.

Wheels and Tires 

Unlike the E65 predecessor, the F01/F02 is fitted with the RunFlat System Component 
RSC package on board as standard. 

Highlights of the safety tires: 

The BMW Group has put together a safety package with the aim of avoiding such acci¬ 
dents as well as the risk involved with changing a tire at the side of the road, at night or in 
wet conditions, in tunnels or at road construction. 

The BMW runflat safety system: 

• Warns the driver in good time of imminent tire pressure loss so that countermea¬ 
sures can be taken 

• Allows the journey to be continued for a defined distance even in the event of com¬ 
plete loss of tire pressure 

• Keeps the tire safely on the rim even in the event of sudden tire pressure loss at high 
speed. 

The system consisting of the RSC tires, rims with EH2+ contour and the electronic tire 
pressure monitoring system (TPMS), renders a spare wheel or space-saver wheel, break¬ 
down kit or vehicle jack unnecessary and this creates more storage space in the luggage 
compartment while also saving weight. 

Extended Hump rims (EH2+) 

The specially shaped rim humps ensure that the RSC tire cannot detach from the rim 
even in the case of sudden tire pressure loss. This means substantially greater safety par¬ 
ticularly when driving at high speed and on winding roads. 

TPMS 

The Tire Pressure Monitoring Systemmonitors the tire pressure via wheel mounted pres¬ 
sure sensors. A warning lamp informs the driver of any irregularities that occur due to the 
loss of tire pressure. 

Note: The TPMS system does not exempt the driver from regularly checking 
the tire pressure. 

After changing the tire pressure or after changing a tire, the TPMS systemmust be reini¬ 
tialized in order to restore the target values with the correct tire pressure. 

The entire safety package consists of three components: 

• Runflat tires 

• Extended hump rims (EH2+) 

• Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)

RSC tires with emergency running properties 

With its reinforced side walls, additional strip inserts and heat-resistant rubber mixtures, 
even when completely depressurized, the “self-supporting tire” makes it possible to con¬ 
tinue the journey for a limited distance at a maximum speed of 50 mph. This means each 
tire is also its own spare wheel. 

The maximum range after complete tire pressure loss is: 

• approximately 250 miles at low vehicle load 

• approximately 150 miles at medium vehicle load 

• approximately 50 miles at high vehicle load. 

ABS, ASC and DSC remain fully operational even in the event of complete tire pressure 
loss. 

When driving with a run flat tire with no pressure, the standard VDC automatically distrib¬ 
utes the vehicle weight over the remaining wheels so as to relieve the load on the depres¬ 
surized tire with the aim of achieving the highest possible range for continued operation. 

F01/F02 Wheel sizes 

For the benefit of creating a sports appearance and to improve the overall design, com¬ 
pared to the E65/E66 the track width on the F01/F02 has been increased while the 
wheel arch overhang has been reduced to a minimum. 

In addition, the entire range of wheels for the F01/F02 has been aligned flush by corre¬ 
spondingly matching the outer rim offset so that, with the exception of the different rim 
dimensions, there are no longer any differences between the tire sizes. 


The following table lists the standard wheels on the F01/F02.
