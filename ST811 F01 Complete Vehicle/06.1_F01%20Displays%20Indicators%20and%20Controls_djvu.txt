Introduction 


As in all other BMW models, the operating and control concept of the new BMW 7 
Series F01/F02 is based on clear and optimum structuring of the cockpit. Fewer switch¬ 
es simplify logical operation. The display, indicator and control elements are organized in 
a hierarchical arrangement corresponding to their function. 

This product information covers exclusively the following topics: 

• Instrument cluster and 

• Central Information Display, CID. 

Note: All other display systems such as "Head-Up Display", "Night Vision 2", 
"Connected Service" and "Personal Profile" are described in detail in 
separate sections of this course’s reference material.

Instrument Cluster 

The instrument cluster is a new development. It has four analog needle instruments 
based on full-surface Black Panel technology. 

With this display technology, the symbols of the individual functions only become visible 
when the ignition is switched on. 

At first glance, the instrument cluster appears as a black surface, without an arrangement 
of digits and different-colored function symbols. 

The two large dials show the road speed and engine speed. 

The two small dials indicate the fuel level on the left-hand side and the oil temperature on 
the right-hand side. 

Most of the indicator lamps arranged are in the center, at the top between the two large 
dials and above the two small dials. 

A permanent background image in orange gives the instrument cluster a certain 3D rep¬ 
resentation. 

The TFT display is located in the lower part of the instrument cluster, in the center 
between the two small dials. 

The display for the Entertainment mode is located on the right-hand side of the display; 
the Navigation display is in the center; and the display for Check Control messages is on 
the left.

Central Information Display (CID) 


The Central Information Display, CID, is a further development of the CID already used in 
BMW models. 

The new BMW 7 Series F01/F02 features very similar software as used in the CID 
installed in the BMW 3 Series with a CIC. 


As on all new BMW models, the system is operated by means of the central control ele¬ 
ment, the controller.

Personal Profile 

The "Personal Profile" systems allows the driver to set several functions in the BMW 7 
Series F01/F02 to suit his/her personal requirements. 

Personal Profile stores the data entered by the driver such as automatic setting of the 
outside mirrors or speed-dependent volume in the corresponding control units. 

As soon as the vehicle is unlocked using the identification transmitter, the system recog¬ 
nizes the corresponding settings belonging to the identification transmitter. 

Up to three different basic settings can be adapted for three different persons. The pre¬ 
condition is that each of the three persons has his/her own identification transmitter.

System Overview 


The system circuit diagram for the outside temperature is displayed below. 

The diagram is structured in such a way that only the control units and control elements 
directly involved in the instrument cluster are shown. 

The instrument cluster receives a large number of different bus signals that provide 
information (speed, CC messages, etc.) for the various displays and indicators. These 
bus signals are requests to the instrument cluster and are therefore not listed in this 
product information. 

The only directly connected component that can be seen in the system circuit diagram 
is the outdoor temperature sensor. 

This input signal is read directly in the instrument cluster and made available from here 
to all other bus users. The outdoor temperature sensor wiring “passes through” the 
junction box and is processed directly by the instrument cluster.

Principles of Operation 


Instrument Cluster 

The instrument cluster receives information on the wiring harness in the form of analog 
and digital electrical signals. These signals are processed and displayed in the instru¬ 
ment cluster or passed on as information to other control units. 

On the new BMW 7 Series F01/F02, the instrument cluster has a number of functions 
that are new to BMW or have changed in relation to existing BMW models. 

Black Panel Technology 

The F01/F02 is the first BMW vehicle to utilize Black Panel technology. This is a panel, 
the back of which is coated with black film that virtually covers the entire surface portion 
of the instrument cluster. 

Black Panel technology is used on the instrument cluster, control panels for IPIKA/AUDIO 
and FKA. 

On the instrument cluster, the area that is not covered by the Black Panel is designed in 
such a way that the symbols of the lamps are not visible when switched off. 

The Black Panel surface appears homogeneously dark, which means that no details 
from the background area can be detected. 

The two large accentuating rings for the speedometer and tachometer and two small 
dial areas for the fuel gauge and oil temperature are galvanized. 




instrument Cluster - Off 

When the instrument cluster is switched 
off, the analog indicators are at their zero 
point, the active area of the display is 
switched off and the rings in the display 
area are not closed. 


Instrument Cluster - Vehicle Awake 

When the vehicle is awake, the analog 
indicators are at their zero point, the active 
area of the display is switched on only to 
complete the lower portion of the rings in 
the display area. 


Note: The control panels for the integrated automatic air-conditioning system 
(IHKA), AUDIO and rear automatic heater / air conditioner (FKA) are also 
designed in this new technology. 


13 

F01 Displays, Indicators and Controls 




TFT Display 

A horizontal TFT display with a resolution of 960 x 160 pixels is integrated in the instru¬ 
ment cluster underneath the dials. 

The large mechanical, analog dials are open at the bottom. These dials are closed by 
graphics. The graphics are displayed digitally and contain specific functional indicators 
such as the range or current consumption. 

The display enables the prioritization of information with the following representations: 

• under right dial - display of audio and telephone lists that can be operated via the 
multifunction display, MFL 

• under left dial - display of longer, two-line Check Control texts 

• center display area - the navigation information, including other navigation texts 
under the left-hand and right-hand dial. 

This structure of the instrument cluster enables flexible use of the display area and keeps 
the signature BMW appearance for the large dials for road speed and engine speed. 

The most important information that appears depending on the content and prioritization 
is: 


• Navigation display • Infotainment (audio and telephone) 

• Voice input acknowledgement • Check Control messages 

• Traffic information • Acknowledgements of assistance systems. 

The background image is activated in orange and is always displayed as soon as anything 
appears in the display. 

Schematic Breakdown of the Display Area 

The graphic in the page below shows the schematic breakdown of the display area in the 
instrument cluster. Nighttime design is activated in the display when the parking lights or 
headlights are on.

F01 Displays, Indicators and Controls 



Daytime-nighttime Design 

The daytime-nighttime design differs with regard to the color assignment of some text 
and graphic elements. 



Nighttime design Daytime design 


The following displays change from white to orange: 

• Scales and scale lettering of the large and small dials 

• Basic indicators, e.g. time, outside temperature 

• Gear indicators 

• On-board computer and navigation displays 

• CC texts and texts for operation acknowledgements 

• Text and line for rear seat belt status 

Under the following conditions, nighttime design is activated in the display: 

• Side lights ON 

• Low-beam headlights ON, in darkness or in a tunnel. 

Note: The texts in the CBS reset menu and the test functions are always in 
white, independently of the daytime / nighttime view.

F01 Displays, Indicators and Controls 





Rev Counter 

On theBMW7 Series F01/F02, engine speed is displayed using the following signal 
chain: 

• The DME control unit sends the engine speed across the PT-CAN to the instrument 
cluster. 

• Using a characteristic curve, step pulses for actuating the stepper motor are 
assigned to the effective engine speed. 

Economy Control (fuel consumption indicator) 

The fuel consumption indicator (economy control) is an analog indicator in the instrument 
cluster. 

Fuel Gauge 

The fuel level is indicated in the small dial on the left. 

A pictogram of a fuel pump lights up in the display of the instrument cluster 
when the level drops below a factory-coded threshold (standard = 8 I gasoline). 

A warning tone additionally sounds on reaching the reserve threshold. 

Outside Temperature Indicator 

The temperature sensor measures the outside temperature and displays it in the instru¬ 
ment cluster. 

In ignition key position "0", the instrument cluster applies terminal 30g current to the tem¬ 
perature sensor every 20 minutes. 

The instrument cluster makes the current outside temperature available in the form of a 
data telegram via the PT-CAN. 

Indicator and Warning Lamps 

The indicator and warning lamps are activated by the processor in the instrument cluster. 

All important and legally stipulated indicator and warning lamps are activated at terminal 
15 ON during the pre-drive check. 

The indicator and warning lamps can be illuminated in different colors or combinations. 


Note: The indicator lamp for the 
rear fog light is not active.

Manipulation Dot 

If a dot appears in the middle under the trip distance recorder and odometer, different 
data are stored in the TFT display and in the CAS 4. 

The manipulation dot is shown when, for example, a comparison of the stored vehicle 
identification numbers indicates that they do not match. 

Note: Different data may be caused, for example, by replacing one of these 
two control units. 

Acoustic Generators 

Audible warnings are given in support of check control messages. All of the acoustic out¬ 
puts reguested in the instrument cluster are generated in the Car Information Computer, 
CIC. The sound patterns of the various acoustic outputs are also stored in the CIC. 

An acoustic generator is built into the instrument cluster fro the turn indicator sound. 

The footwell module is responsible for control of the direction indicator function via the 
K-CAN2. 

The vehicles additionally feature an ignition key warning and a seat belt warning. 

An uninterrupted warning tone sounds when the driver's door is opened with terminal 15

Component Replacement and Trial Replacement 

There are three possible combinations for replacing the instrument clusters and 
Car Access System 4, CAS 4. 

• Instrument cluster defective, CAS 4 OK 

• CAS 4 defective, instrument cluster OK 

• CAS 4 and instrument cluster must be replaced. 

Simultaneous replacement of CAS 4 and the instrument cluster should be avoided. 

The odometer reading will be lost as a result. 

In principle, it is also possible to carry out a trial replacement of the instrument 
cluster and CAS 4. 

Central Information Display (CID) 

Service Mode 

The controller can be used to activate the Service mode functions. 

The Service mode is a special facility which provides information about the status of the 
display and user control system. 

Note: This function was created to aid in diagnosis and is not intended for the 
customer. 

The Service mode can be used, for example, to read out hardware/software versions for 
the Central Information Display or control units in the CIC system network. 

As an addition to the comprehensive facilities of the diagnosis system, the Service mode 
serves as a simple means of quickly accessing diagnostic data without a BMW diagnosis 
system.
