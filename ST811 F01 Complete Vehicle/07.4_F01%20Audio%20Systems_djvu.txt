Introduction 


History 

With the launch of the E65, an optical bus (MOST) was used for the first time in a series 
production vehicle for the purpose of transmitting digitized audio signals. 

With the introduction of the E93 in 2007 a USB interface for external audio devices was 
offered for the first time in BMW vehicles. The media can be accessed from the Drive 
and the audio data played through the vehicle speakers. 

New Features 

The CIC system is a further development of the previous CCC system. The CIC head 
unit was installed for the first time on the BMW 1 Series and 3 Series in 2008. 

The New BMW 7 Series, the F01/F02 is eguipped with an enhanced version of the 
CIC system. 

By storing data on a 80 GB hard disk, the new head unit provides many new functions 
and options. 

In the audio systems, this development is reflected by the new music collection function. 
Music files can be converted (ripped) or copied for the music collection onto the hard 
disk. 

Storing the music on the CIC-dedicated hard disk allows fast access to these music 
files at all times. 

A selection of up to 3700 music files (12 GB) is possible. 

A USB interface is provided in the glove compartment for import/export purposes 
(data copy or data backup). 

The digital radio systems IBOC tuner/decoder is now integrated in the CIC. 

A common station list together with the analog systems provides added convenience. 

An improved antenna system makes reception of the radio stations even more stable 
and less prone to interference. An additional interference suppression filter enhances the 
reception over long distances, particularly in the AM range. 

A modified base plate makes it possible to connect to and play back music tracks stored 
in the mobile phone with the Smartphone Integration option (6NF). This option is 
currently available only with the iPhone®. 

Music tracks stored in the mobile phone can now be easily accessed. Simple menu 
navigation and playback of these music tracks can now be controlled via the Drive.

Principals of Operation 


Comparison of CIC with CCC 

The ASK system was installed in E65/E66. With the E60, ASK developed into M-ASK 
and the further developed CCC which was available as an option. 

The multi-audio system controller M-ASK is the central control unit of the information 
and communications systems. The M-ASK combines up to four control units in one. 

The M-ASK combines the following control units in one housing: 

•ASK 

• Antennal amplifier/tuner 

• MOST CAN gateway, interface to control display 
In the E65, these modules were separate control units. 

The car communication computer CCC is the central control unit which combines the 
functions of the M-ASK, plus some additional functions. 

Voice control of the systems and the navigation system with map presentation were 
made possible with the CCC. 

The CCC also contains the driver for the rear passenger compartment display. 

The CCC performs all the functions of the M-ASK as well as offering Navigation and 
additional programming possibilities. 

As part of this development from the ASK to the CCC system, the radio tuner, navigation, 
voice recognition and actuation as well as video signal processing were integrated in the 
CCC. 

A comparison is repeatedly made in this training information between the predecessor, 
Car Communication Computer head unit and the new CIC head unit. 

Note: For further information on the CIC refer to the Vehicle Owner’s Manual 
and the CIC training material available in TIS and ICR

The star-shaped operating concept of “Turn-Press-Push” of the CCC has been further 
developed in the CIC. 

The sub-menus in the main menu now are arranged in lists. 

All listed sub-menus can be accessed in the start menu by “turning” and “pressing” 
the controller. 

Several sub-menus can now also be selected by means of the direct access buttons on 
the controller. 

The windows of the selected submenus are placed horizontally one over the other.

F01 Audio Systems 



Display 

The display used for the Car Information Computer is the same CID (Central Information 
Display) known from the CCC. 

In the F01/F02, the screen size has increased to a diagonal of 10.2” (26cm). 

The number of pixels has doubled in the CID from 640x240 pixels for the CCC display 
to 1280x480 pixels in the CIC central display. 

The new display delivers a crisp and improved picture quality compared to the previous 
system. 

The graphic layout of the user interface has been totally redesigned. 

The rearview of the F01/F02 control display is shown in the following with the two con¬ 
nections.

Controller 

The second most inportant hardware component of the BMW Drive system is the 
controller. 

The new controller has been completely redesigned compared to the CCC controller. 

The most noticeable new feature of the CIC controller are the seven direct access 
buttons. 

It is now possible to access the following menus directly: 

• Main menu 

• CD/Multimedia 

• Radio 

• Navigation 

• Telephone 

The following menus can still only be selected from the main menu, 
i.e. with no direct access: 

• Contacts 

• BMW Services 

• Vehicle information 

• Settings 


The “Back” button is pressed to go back to the last display view. Up to 30 “back” steps 
are possible with this button. 

The option button makes it possible to make fine adjustments or carry out special 
functions in the sub-menu last selected. 

The direct access buttons replace the “long push” function. With this function is was 
possible to change from a sub-menu directly to another sub-menu in the CCC by 
pushing the controller in the corresponding direction for at least two seconds. 

The respective sub-menus are now selected directly by pressing the CD/multimedia, 
radio, navigation or telephone buttons twice.

CD/Multimedia 

In terms of their functionality, the CD/DVD, external devices and sound submenus located 
under CD/Multimedia are similarly configured as the Drive “Entertainment” menu of the 
CCC. 

This training material mainly deals with the Music collection selection menu. The other 
selection menus are described in detail in the Vehicle Owner’s Manual. 

With the music collection, it is possible to store music data within the CIC on an 80GB 
hard disk. A total of 12 GB is reserved for the music collection, corresponding to about 
3700 music tracks. 

A music search function has been implemented, which searches for information 
(metadata) on the individual music tracks (artist, album, etc.). 

A music track database (Gracenote®) provides further information to the music track 
(metadata). This takes place as a supplementary function to the conversion process from 
Digital Audio CD to a WMA file. A storage space of 4 GB is reserved for this purpose on 
the CIC-internal hard disk.

Storing Music Data on the HDD 

The music collection is stored in a partition on the internal hard disk drive (HDD) of the 
CIC. This device makes it possible to store a large selection of music data in the vehicle, 
while allowing the option to retrieve it when necessary. 

Up to 12GB of the total 80 GB hard drive is set aside for the music collection. 

The following three options can be used to store music data on the hard disk: 

• Rip function from Compact Disk Audio format 

• Copying data via the CD/DVD drive 

• Copying data from the USB

Rip Function 

This function rips commercially available audio CDs (marked with the 
Compact Disk Digital Audio logo) and converts them to compressed 
music files. 

This function can be performed when the vehicle is stationary or while driving. 

The music on the CD can also be played back during the conversion and storage 
process of the rip function. 

The music data is converted at a speed between 3 and 12 times the playback speed. 
Following the conversion the music data is stored on the hard disk in WMA file format. 

The data is then displayed in the form of file folders in the music collection menu. 
These folders are identified with the corresponding title and with a round CD icon. 

After the conversion process the files will be displayed and can now be selected 
individually by using the music search function.

F01 Audio Systems 







Copying Data from the USB 

Data contained on a USB stick (music files in MP3, WMA or AAC format) can be 
imported via the import/export USB port located in the glove compartment. 

Copying music data from audio devices such as an MP3 players or iPods using the USB 
connection is possible although not advisable. 

The folder and file structure of the player are also copied when copying music files from 
an audio player (MP3 player, iPod®). In this case, the copied folder names are represent¬ 
ed by means of cryptic characters instead of al album title. This makes a subseguent 
search for a music file virtually impossible.

The imported USB music data is stored in file folders with USB 1, USB 2 etc. in the 
music collection. These folders are also shown together with a folder icon as the files 
copied through the DVD drive. 



Copied USB1 folder Stored in the Music Collection Menu 

Compatible USB sticks must be FAT formatted and must support the Mass Storage 
Class USB protocol. The format can be easily checked on any PC running the Windows 
operating system. 

The file system (FAT 16, FAT 32 or NTFS) is shown under properties of the USB stick in 
the Windows Explorer. The protocol which is used is shown by clicking the hardware icon 
in the windows information area. 

When using a USB stick device with several partitions, the music data files must be 
located in the first partition in order to be recognized and processed. 

USB hard drives, USB hubs and USB memory card readers with several slots cannot be 
read when connected to the USB jack in the glove compartment and therefore can not 
be used. 

Depending on the USB lead used, the mass storage device may be able to be charged 
through the USB interface. However, the power consumption of the mass storage device 
must not exceed the maximum level of 500 mA permitted. 

It is recommended that when charging a storage device, only the USB audio interface in 
the center console be used and not the USB in the glove compartment. 


Note: The USB interface in the glove compartment is only intended for the 
import and export of data (music or personal profiles) to and from the 
vehicle.

File System 

The folders of the converted or copied music files can subsequently be renamed in the 
“Options” menu. 

For this purpose, the corresponding album entry must be marked in the music collection 
and then the “Options” menu selected. 

It is important to note the following when coping music files with Digital Rights 
Management (DRM) protection to the music collection: 

• AAC music data in the M4P format (P = Protected) cannot be 
copied to the hard disk. 

• Only music data in WMA format with copy protection can be copied. 

This data will be shown in the music collection and in the music search. However, 
these protected tracks cannot be played. The track will be “skipped” or ignored and 
a different non-protected music track will be played. 

The reason for this is that it is not possible to provide purchaser authentication in the 
CIO because a link to the online provider cannot be established. It is suggested that the 
customer import the audio files using a self recorded Digital Audio CD. 

All music download portals allow the creation of a Digital Audio CD for the downloaded 
music track. However, the number of copies that can be created is limited by licensing 
legislation. 


38 

F01 Audio Systems 



Data Saving (Backup) 

The customer has the option of saving his/her complete music collection under the 
"Options" sub-menu. This is achieved by copying it back to a USB stick installed in 
the glove box port. It is necessary to ensure that the USB stick has sufficient storage 
capacity. A maximum storage capacity of 12 GB is reguired for saving the music collec¬ 
tion data.

The process is similar to the data saving procedure on a PC. This function makes it 
possible to import data when changing vehicles or when replacing a head unit or hard 
disk. 

Data saving will only be possible if the hard disk of the CIC has not been damaged 
and the interfaces to the CIC are still fully operational. 

Data back up should be done prior to programming the vehicle after replacing control 
units. Without data saving (backup), all of the music data could be lost. However, this can 
only be done by the customer prior to bringing the vehicle in for service. Detailed instruc¬ 
tions on how and where the data backup can be performed are provided in the Vehicle 
Owner's Manual. 


WARNING!!! 


For copyright reasons, the service personnel are not 
permitted to perform the data backup for the customer. 
The service personnel, can, however, instruct the 
customer on how to perform the backup procedure.

Music Search 

The "Music search" sub-menu is provided in the music collection for the purpose of 
managing a large guantity of music files. 

The music search takes place in accordance with a special filtering process. The search 
can be started at any menu item in the music search. For example, if the menu item 
"Genre" is selected as the starting point, all albums of all artists together with all the 
tracks in this music direction will be made available for selection. 

In the next step, only the artist is selected and all his/her albums are displayed. 

The search is now filtered further with each step until at the end, only the reguired entry 
remains. 

The information for the music search is stored in the form of a metafile, similar to the 
ID3 tags of an MP3 file. 

An example of how these metafile or meta information could appear is shown below:

Data management is achieved with the aid of a music track database. 

The music track database information is stored on the hard disk of the CIC for the pur¬ 
pose of managing the music file’s metadata. A 4 GB partition is allocated to the music 
search function. 

The CIC is equipped with special software provided by Gracenote® for the purpose of 
identifying the complete albums of ripped Digital Audio CDs. It provides additional infor¬ 
mation about the music track on the respective Digital Audio CD converted to WMA files. 

This music track database (Gracenote®) uses TOC (Table of Contents) as the identifica¬ 
tion pattern. This means, complete albums on Digital Audio CDs are identified based on 
the number of tracks and the track length. 

The corresponding data (track, artist, etc.) is then accordingly assigned to the music files 
in the music search database. 

On conclusion of the conversion procedure to WMA files, the new metadata is automati¬ 
cally added to the directory structure in the music search. It is not possible to rename or 
edit this metadata after it is in the hard disk. 

Note: Albums with newly released metadata at the time of vehicle delivery 
will no longer be identified. The music track database would require a 
permanent link with the server in order to keep this data up to date and 
this is not possible. 


41 

F01 Audio Systems 




Unrecognized metadata of Digital Audio CDs is stored in the music collection as 
"Audio-CD 1", "Audio- CD 2", etc., together with the CD icon. 

The metadata for the music track database from copied CD/DVD-ROMs or USB sticks is 
adopted identically in the music search function. This metadata does not stem from the 
music track database but rather from the user/customer himself. 

The metadata, copied from a USB stick or CD/DVD ROM, cannot be renamed in the CIC. 

In order to correct the faulty metadata on a track or file, the file must first be deleted from 
the hard disk in the CIC. 

The user can then rename or add to these metadata files corresponding to the music 
track database structure (genre, artist, album and track) by using software on a personal 
computer. 

When the file is imported back into the CIC hard disk, the correct metafiles will be dis¬ 
played. This procedure also ensures that the music search will also find the copied music 
data with the music track, artist, etc. 

Updating unknown music tracks is only possible with WMA files from ripped Digital Audio 
CD. If the user/customer does not follow this procedure, in time the music search will 
become unusable. 

A “current” version of the music track database is stored in the vehicle on delivery. 

The information about music CDs (Digital Audio CDs) released after the vehicle delivery 
will not be found in the vehicle's music track database. 

Note: If the metadata is not found because the Gracenote database in the CIC 
is outdated, the tracks will not be recognized. 


42 

F01 Audio Systems 



Updating the (Gracenote®) Database 

To keep the entire contents of the music track database (Gracenote®) up to date, 

BMW Service is equipped with the latest CD of the music track database (Gracenote®). 

This update takes place in connection with the media package, which also contains the 
Gracenote Update CD. 

The CD can be loaded directly in the CIC drive and updated via the Service menu of the 
CIC (See Service Information). 

The update of the music track database (Gracenote®) will become effective in the WMA 
music files only after subsequent conversions (rip function) of Digital Audio CD. 

Metadata will no longer be added to files that were ripped before the update of the music 
track database (Gracenote®). 

The reason for this is that the music track database is only accessed when a Digital Audio 
CD is loaded and subsequently ripped.

System Components 


This section describes the audio systems in F01/F02 vehicles. 

It is subdivided into the following subsections: 

• Flead unit, Car Information Computer CIC 

• Amplifiers and speakers 

• Antennas 

• Digital tuners 

• Peripherals 

- DVD changer 

- USB/audio interface 

- Smartphone integration option 

The new head unit (CIC) replaces the CCC head unit and is 
standard eguipment on the F01/F02. 

The IBOC digital tuner is now integrated into the CIC. 

The navigation system is also integrated into the CIC. The navigation software 
and navigation map material are stored on the CIC internal hard disk. 

The Car Information Computer can be combined with the following speaker and 
amplifier systems: 

• HiFi system (676) 

• TOP-Hifi system (677) 

With the F01/F02 the antenna reception has been enhanced. 

The satellite tuner “SIRIUS satellite radio” and IBOC digital radio for 
HD radio reception are optionally available. 

A CD changer is no longer offered for the F01/ F02. 

The single-slot DVD changer is offered on the F01 and F02. The DVD changer can 
accept up to six disks. The disks are inserted in the unit without the use of a magazine. 

A USB/audio interface is also available as an optional extra. External audio and storage 
media are incorporated in the vehicle entertainment system via this USB/audio interface. 

Devices such as the iPhone® can now be integrated in the vehicle network by means of 
the Smartphone Integration Option. With the mobile phone cradle it possible to navigate 
in the device menu and play back selected audio files. Although the device can also be 
connected with the USB Y-cable it is no longer necessary for this function.

Similar to a personal computer, the Car Information Computer contains a processor, RAM 
modules (= main memory) and extra peripheral components. 

The following applications of the CIC are stored on the integrated hard disk: 

• Music collection 

• Music track database (Gracenote®) 

• Navigation software (application) 

• Navigation map material 

• iSpeech (voice recognition system) 

• Contacts (database with address book data) 

The CIC is the central control unit for the listed applications. It is linked to the central 
information display (CID) for the purpose of transmitting and displaying information. 

The Car Information Computer is also connected to the controller. The controller serves 
as a selection and input device for the user interface. 

The CIC is based on a modular design. The most important systems of the communica¬ 
tion network are integrated in the CIC board as solid state components. 

The CIC combines the following control units in one enclosure: 

• Navigation computer, HIP module and yaw rate sensor 

• Tuner (FM) 

• Tuner (AM) 

• Tuner (FM-RTTI) 

• IBOC decoder 

• Audio system controller, and music search database 

• MOST-CAN gateway 

• Interface to control display (LVDS) 


The upper half of the CIC consists of the optical drive player where CDs and DVDs of 
digital audio media can be played. The player also has ability to playback video DVDs on 
the front CID. The video signal is only displayed when the vehicle is stationary with the 
gear selection in the “Park” postilion. 


52 

F01 Audio Systems 




For the navigation system, the optical drive can be used for updating the map material 
stored on the hard disk. 

The processors for the main board and application board are located in the lower half of 
the CIC. This section also contains the main memory, the individual modules as well as 
the hard disk drive. The CIC together with the controller and CID, make up the 
Drive system. 


Advantages of the Car Information Computer 

Combining several modules in one enclosure provides the following advantages: 

• The combination of several systems enhances the functionality 

• Outstanding software expansion options through suitable software interfaces 

• Fewer plug connections increases reliability 

• Less overall package space reguired for control units

LVDS Technology 

The transmission of picture data from the CCC to the CID was performed by means of an 
8-wire LVDS (low voltage differential signaling) line. With the introduction of the Car 
Information Computer, the video signal is now transmitted through a 2-wire LVDS line. 

The change in picture data transmission in the vehicle reflect the changes made in PC 
technology. While the printer was formerly connected to the PC via a parallel cable, data 
transmission now takes place using serial USB technology. 

In the following graphics, 8-wire LVDS technology is compared to the new 2-wire 
LVDS technology: 

8-wire LVDS 

Transmission of video signals via 
8-wire LVDS technology with CCC 
and CID. 

(LVDS+ and LVDS- for each of the 
four signal lines and an additional 
synchronization line) 


2-wire LVDS 

Transmission of video signals via 
2-wire LVDS technology with CIC 
and CID. 


Signal transmission through this 2-wire LVDS line offers four distinct advantages: 

• Higher data transfer rate 

• Simplified wiring 

• Runtime differences between the individual lines are avoided 

• Serial 2-wire LVDS data transmission is now much more 
cost-effective than 8-wire LVDS technology 

The main advantage of using serial 2-wire LVDS is the resulting high picture resolution. 



55 

F01 Audio Systems 





















A 4-core, shielded cable is used for the 2-wire 
LVDS technology. The cable consists of the 
four cores, LVDS+, LVDS-, 2x ground and 
shielding. 

For Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) 
reasons, the unused wire is also connected to 
ground. 

In the illustration to the right, the advantages 
of both cores connected to ground are shown 
with the aid of field lines. 

The capacitive interference of the signals is 
deflected to ground. The wires connected to 
ground form a defined potential and cannot act 
as antennas. 

This ensures that additional interference is 
avoided.

Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) 


It is essential to follow ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) guidelines when replacing individual 
components in order to avoid damage to internal components of the CIC. These reguire- 
ments also apply when storing or sending back components. 

Special packaging (ESD bags, ESD boxes with film or foam material cladding) is available 
for this purpose and should be used instead of conventional packaging materials. 

The following picture illustrates the effects of electrostatic discharge (ESD) on electronic 
components.

Working on Electronic Components 

The following requirements must be observed when working on electronic components 
on the Car Information Computer. 

• The work must be performed on a conductive and grounded workbench 
(special tool 12 7 192 is used for this purpose). 

• The grounding cable must be connected to a secure grounding point (water pipe, 
heating pipe, electric socket ground). 

• The person carrying out the work must first put on the grounding cuff in order to 
ground himself before removing the components from the packaging. 

• The electronic components are placed on the anti-static mat which is also 
connected to a grounding cable.

CIC Components 

The components listed above are defined as separate or modular. These components 
are attached to the main/complete head unit. 

Of these components, only the faceplate remains a serviceable and replaceable compo¬ 
nent. Failure of any other internal component will necessitate the replacement of the 
entire CIC unit once proper authorization has been obtained through PuMA. 

The functions of the individual components are briefly described in the following pages. 

The installation and removal instructions for the individual components and the complete 
CIC control unit are available in TIS (Technical Information System) or the workshop 
system ISTA.

Optical Drive (CD/DVD Player) 

The Car Information Computer is equipped with a DVD-ROM player. 

The optical drive is used for playing audio and video media. 

This drive makes it possible to play the following media file formats: 

• Audio CDs (CD Digital Audio) 

• Audio CD-ROM with MP3, WMA or AAC files 

• DVD Audio (only stereo track if contained on the data medium) 

• Audio DVD-ROM with MP3, WMA or AAC files 

• Video DVD 

Playing video on the (front) CID display is only possible when the vehicle is stationary 
with the gear selector in the “Park” position. When the vehicle is moving or in gear, only 
the audio track of the video will be played. 

Although the CD/DVD drive is no longer used for the navigation system (as in CCC), 
it may be used to update navigation map data from a navigation DVD.

Hard Disk Drive 

With the development CIC, a hard disk for storing applications (programs) and data 
is used in a head unit of a BMW vehicle for the first time. 

A 2.5" hard disk drive with a storage a capacity of 80 GB is installed. 

This makes it possible to display complex graphics like 3D models in the perspective 
view of the navigation system. 

This system provides the option of converting, storing and playing music tracks. 

The hard disk makes it possible to maintain a music collection with a music track 
database (Gracenote®). 

The HDD (hard disk drive) also provides a data storage option for the three languages of 
the voice recognition system. 

The hard disk drive is a replaceable component of the CIC. Proper repair instructions 
and ESD guidelines must be followed when replacing the unit. 

The Music collection backup should only be performed by the customer and not the 
service technician. For more information refer to “Music Collection Backup” in the 
Principles of Operation section of this training material. 

The following illustrations show the hard disk location and the individual partitions.

Fan 

Unlike with CCC, it is not possible to replace the fan of the Car Information Computer 
separately as part of a service procedure. 

The fan provides cooling for the entire hardware assembly, including the hard disk drive 
and the gateway processor (located directly below it). The exhaust air cools the cooling 
fins of the HiFi output stage in the power board as it is routed through a cooling channel 
out of the unit.

GPS Receiver Module 

The GPS receiver module is also known as the HIP module (Host Independence 
Positioning). 

Location and route of the vehicle are calculated in the navigation system with the data 
from the GPS receiver module. 


This module was already integrated in the head unit with the CCC system. It has the task 
of converting the signals received from the GPS antenna together with the data from the 
DSC control unit and yaw rate sensor. 


The following information is calculated in the GPS receiver module: 

• Longitude 

• Latitude 

• Altitude above sea level 

• Direction (bearing) 

• Speed 


This information is known as Almanac data and it is transferred to the navigation system 
for further processing. The Almanac data must be permanently stored for future refer¬ 
ence. One of the reasons for this is that it takes a long time for data to be received again 
from satellites after switching to terminal 15 from terminal status ignition "OFF". 


This Almanac data ensures the position of the vehicle is recognized immediately after 
starting the vehicle. Therefore the navigation system can also be used immediately. 


Compared to the GPS receiver module of the Car Communication Computer the GPS 
receiver module in the CIC has been greatly reduced in size while maintaining the same 
functionality. 


The graphic shows the size of the GPS 
receiver module compared to the main 
connection plug of the head unit.

Yaw Rate Sensor 

The Car Information Computer features a yaw rate sensor. It supplies the data relating to 
changes in driving direction for the navigation system. 

This data is reguired for the purpose of determining the exact position as satellite signals 
cannot be received everywhere (tunnels, underground parking lot etc.). 

The yaw rate sensor is a separate module 
soldered on the main board. It has been 
greatly reduced in size compared to the 
yaw rate sensor in the Car Communication 
Computer. 

Unlike with CCC, it is no longer possible to 
replace the yaw rate sensor separately from 
the entire unit.

Gateway Processor 

The gateway processor converts all relevant data of the K-CAN system into MOST-bus 
telegrams and vice versa. 


The electronic module is soldered into the board 
directly under the hard disk drive and cannot be 
replaced separately. 



The gateway processor has its own control unit

Analog Tuner Modules 

The tuner modules in the Car Information Computer have enhanced functions compared 
to the tuners used in the CCC system. The FM/AM and the traffic information (RTTI) 
range have been expanded. 

FM and AM Station List 

A double tuner module (see item 1) is installed in the CIC for the FM/AM range. 

While one tuner in the network receives the reguired station and outputs the music 
signal, the other tuner works in the background searching the station landscape for 
additional signals and shows them on the display. ("All stations" menu item). 

This function in the FM range is already known from the CCC and is now available 
in the AM range. 

The third module in the tuner network enables expansion of the FM-RTTI (Real Time 
Traffic Information) functions. The FM/AM double tuner module and the FM-RTTI 
module combine to form the triple tuner. 

The RTTI messages are used by the navigation system for displaying congestion and 
traffic information in the form of pictograms.

IBOC System/HD Radio 

The IBOC (In-Band- On-Channel) system is offered as the digital radio. With the intro¬ 
duction of the CIO, the control unit of the IBOC system has been integrated in the head 
unit as the IBOC decoder. 

The IBOC system was developed by the company Ibiguity and, with the aid of a decoder, 
enables the reception of HD (High Definition) radio through the FM/AM double tuner. 

This system simultaneously broadcasts an analog and digital signal. 

A special oscilloscope (spectrum analyzer) would show the digital components at both 
sides of the analog wave of the FM frequency (step shape). 

The IBOC system receives the signals with the aid of the FM double tuner module. 

These signals are then routed to the IBOC decoder which adds the digital data stream to 
the audible music signals.

Both services differ to the effect that the signal previously broadcast analog in the MPS is 
now used in digital form. 

The decoder delays digital reception for several seconds until it is synchronous again with 
the analog signal previously heard. 

SPS offers additional radio stations that are only broadcast in digital form. Using the multi¬ 
cast method, it is possible to accommodate up to seven digital stations in the submenu 
of the SPS main station. Normally, however, a maximum of 3 sub-menu are offered in the 
SPS. 



Sub-menu of the IBOC main station 

The system automatically switches over to analog FM reception if the digital signal is no 
longer available. 

HD radio is also available in the AM freguency range. In this case, the digital signals are 
transmitted on directly adjacent freguencies of the analog station. Multicast is not sup¬ 
ported on AM. The content of the digitally broadcast station is the same as that of the 
analog station. 

HD radio plays AM radio stations in near-FM guality and FM radio stations in near-CD 
guality.

Amplifiers and Speakers 

The speaker systems on the F01/F02 are available in two versions: 

• HiFi system (Standard) 

• Top-FHiFi system. (Option) 

The HiFi system is the standard audio equipment for the F01/F02 . The HiFi system is 
equipped with a 8-channel amplifier with digital equalizer. However only 7 of the 8 
channels are used in the HiFi system. 

The central bass speakers are located under the front seats. They are coupled to the 
side sills (rocker panels). That increases the resonance volume necessary for bass 
reproduction. 

The head unit CIC can be combined with any of the two amplifier/speaker systems. 

The HiFi and Top-HiFi systems feature separate speakers for the treble and midrange 
frequencies. 

Even though the diameters of the speakers in the HiFi and Top-HiFi systems are the 
same, there are differences in the power output of the speakers. This is achieved by the 
use of different materials for the diaphragms, coils and magnets. The designations HiFi 
and Top-HiFi are used in the table in the next page to distinguish the systems. 

The Top-HiFi system achieves double the sound level of the HiFi system. 

A digital 10-channel amplifier is used in the Top-HiFi system. However only 9 of the 10 
channels are used in the Top-HiFi system. 

The Top-HiFi system supports playback of multichannel formats. Multichannel audio 
formats can be played back with the player in the CIC or with the 6 DVD changer. 

Optimum audio reproduction in the vehicle is achieved by way of complex digital signal 
processing. 

The HiFi system has 12 speakers while the Top-HiFi system has 16 speakers each with 
different auxiliary amplifiers.

HiFi Amplifier 

The HiFi amplifier is connected to the K-CAN for coding and diagnostics. The HiFi 
amplifier can be programmed but it is supplied by the manufacturer already prepro¬ 
grammed at the factory. 

The Audio signals are transmitted in analog form from the head unit to the HiFi 
amplifier. The internal digital egualizer adapts the audio signals specifically to the vehicle, 
as determined by the coding. The Drive does not egualize any signals. 

The adapted and amplified signals of HiFi guality are distributed through seven audio 
channels to a total of twelve speakers: 

• One tweeter and one mid-range speaker in each of the front doors. 

• One tweeter and mid-range speaker in the dashboard (center). 

• One tweeter and one mid-range speaker on the rear shelf. 

• One central bass speaker under each of the front seats. 

The HiFi amplifier is located at the rear left of the luggage compartment behind 
the side panel trim.

Top-HiFi Amplifier 

The features of the Top-HiFi amplifier are: 

• MOST control unit 

• Graphic 7-channel equalizer controlled by Drive 

• Playback of multichannel audio formats 

• Higher output power in the low frequency range 

• 15 V output voltage for each mid-range speaker/tweeter 

• 30 V output voltage for each central bass speaker 

The audio signals and the control signals are sent in digital form to the Top-HiFi amplifier 
through the fiber-optic cable (MOST). 

Programming, coding and diagnostics are carried out via the MOST. 

The Top-HiFi amplifier supports playback of multichannel signals in 5.1 format. 

The signals are output in 7.2 format (seven mid-range/treble channels and two central 
bass channels).

F01 Audio Systems 










Using those channels, the sound tracks on a DVD can be played directly and entirely 
independently on each individual channel. In combination, those sound tracks produce a 
surround sound effect. For that reason, the process is described as discrete multichannel 
playback. 

There are normally two sound tracks recorded on a CD to reproduce the stereo signal, 
the usual practice on a DVD is to use the 5.1 format with 6 sound tracks. 

To adapt that format best to the vehicle environment (two rows of seats), it is converted 
into 7.2 format and reproduced through seven mid-range/tweeter and two central bass 
channels. 

For multichannel playback, the Top-HiFi amplifier decodes the digital data from the data 
source. 

Multichannel audio formats can be played back both with the CIC player as well as the 
DVD changer. 

The following multichannel audio formats are supported: 

• Dolby Digital Surround 

• Dolby Digital Surround Ex 

• DTS (Digital Theater System) 

• DTS-ES (Digital Theater System-Extended Surround) 


The multichannel audio format is indicated on the DVD case. 

The Top-HiFi amplifier supports Dolby Pro Logic II for calculating the spatial sound 
information from an existing stereo signal. 

This process replaces Logic 7 known from other BMW vehicles. A surround sound effect 
can be computed from the stereo signal, which consists only of a left and right channel. 

The signals of the individual channels are output with time correction from the 16 
available speakers of the Top-HiFi system in the F01/F02. This produces a homogeneous 
sound effect for the listener in 7.2 format. 

Audio playback can also be adjusted by the customer through the Drive with the aid of 
the 7 channel equalizer integrated in the Top-HiFi amplifier. 

After signals have been processed, the audio signals are forwarded as analog low 
frequency signals to the speakers. 

The Top-HiFi amplifier supports speed-dependent equalization in addition to speed- 
dependent volume control. The effect is that the frequency response is adjusted in 
relation to the speed of the vehicle.

A total of 16 speakers are controlled through nine amplifier channels with Top-HiFi 
quality: 

• one tweeter and one mid-range speaker in each of the front doors. 

• one tweeter and one mid-range speaker in the dashboard (center). 

• one tweeter and mid-range speaker in each of the rear doors. 

• one tweeter and one mid-range speaker on rear shelf. 

• one central bass speaker under each of the front seats.

Antenna Diversity Module with Amplifier 

The high frequency signals broadcast by the radio stations are received via the rear 
window antennas (FM1, FM2, FM3 and AM) 

The antenna amplifiers are in the antenna diversity module. There are separate amplifiers 
for AM and FM. The antenna amplifier (of the antenna diversity module) is located 
between the 3rd brake light and roof antenna. 

When the CIC is switched on, the antenna diversity/amplifier is activated and powered by 
the Rad_On signal. The remote control service part of the antenna diversity module is 
powered via terminal 30. 

The high frequency signals from the AM and FM antennas as well as from the is 
amplified. These signals are routed via a ribbon cable from the rear window to the anten¬ 
na diversity module. 

The antennal amplifier also supports the frequencies of the weatherband. 

Weatherband is transmitted over seven channels in the frequency range from 162.400 
MHz to 162.550 MHz. The weatherband tuner is incorporated in the FM module of the 
head unit.

FM Antenna Diversity 

In the F01/F02, an FM antenna diversity is standard equipment. 

The FM antenna diversity comprises: 

• FM1, FM2 and FM3 antennas 

• FM antenna amplifier with diversity module 

The FM1 to FM3 antennas route their RF signal to the antenna amplifier in the antenna 
diversity module. 

The signal quality of the currently selected FM antenna (FM1 to FM3) is now evaluated in 
the antenna diversity module. 

The high-frequency signal from the active FM antenna at any particular time is fed by the 
antenna amplifier and antenna diversity module via a coaxial cable to the tuner module in 
the head unit.

Station frequency prior to selection by customer 


The tuner module in the CIC is now informed of the station selected by the customer 
using iDrive. As a result, the tuner module in the CIC selects the matching frequency. 
This is done by setting a bandpass filter. The bandpass filter suppresses all frequencies 
above and below the selected station frequencies.

Station frequency after selection by customer 


The remaining RF signal is then demodulated in the tuner and output in the form of an 
audio signal through the speakers. 

The tuner module in the CIC detects that an antenna diversity module is installed and 
generates the changeover voltage (Us) and the signal of the intermediate freguency (IF) 
necessary for diversity operation. 

Selection of the individual antennas (diversity function) 

The intermediate freguency is an RF signal (10.7 MHz) and is evaluated by the electronic 
circuitry inside the diversity module. The antenna diversity module will switch to the next 
FM antenna if the signal guality of the current radio station on the active antenna deterio¬ 
rates to a certain level in terms of guality and field strength. 

The changeover takes place in a way that no interruption can be heard. 

Selection of the various reception modes of the antenna diversity module 

The changeover between AM reception, FM diversity operation and diagnostic mode 
occurs in response to the DC voltage Us. 

This is performed in the head unit and analyzed in the diversity module with the following 
criteria: 

• Diversity mode is active when U s = 2.5 V. 

• AM mode is active, or the FM1 antenna is selected, when U s = 0 V. 

• Diversity mode is active at U s = 5 V. 

• The changeover in diagnosis mode to the next antenna takes place by 8 V pulses.

HBL Filter 

The HBL filter is fitted to suppress interference pulses from the additional brake light 
during radio reception. HBL stands for high-level brake light (third brake light). 

A pulse-modulated signal (PWM) activates the third brake light. This kind of activation 
(PWM rectangular signal) can cause high-frequency interference. This is especially 
common with AM reception. The reason for this is that the audio information is contained 
in the amplitudes in the AM signal.

AM Restrictor 

AM reception has been improved on the F01/F02. 

Due to the great distances with relatively few radio broadcasting towers, in less 
populated areas of the US AM radio is more accessible than FM radio. 

Interference freguencies from the vehicle electrical system pose reception problems in 
terms of the guality of AM radio. In an unrestricted antenna system, these interference 
freguencies spread from the vehicle electrical system through the power supply to the 
rear window defogger into the antenna system. 

The AM restrictor was specially developed to address this issue. 

The AM restrictor supplies voltage to the upper section of the rear window. In addition, 
the rejector circuit components provide sound guality filtering. 

The main component is a coil which acts as an extremely high resistance to RF signal, 
resulting in significantly improved AM reception.

SDARS Satellite Tuner 


The SDARS (Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service) control unit enables reception of digital 
radio signals. 

Digital transmissions are superior in guality to analog transmissions. The radio stations of 
the satellite tuner can be selected under the “Satellite radio” submenu. 

Advantages of digital satellite radio: 

• Reception of same radio station across the entire US mainland (excluding Alaska). 

• Digital reception of music, news and talk stations. 

• Wide choice of available music genres. 

• No commercial breaks.

The satellite tuner is designed for the Sirius Satellite Radio subscription service. The 
SDARS signals are transmitted by three satellites. In areas without coverage, the SDARS 
signals are beamed terrestrially. 

Both SDARS signals (satellite and terrestrial) are received by a single antenna in the roof 
antenna assembly and supplied to the SDARS control unit. 

The SDARS satellite tuner is located in the luggage compartment on the left-hand side. 

When the system is activated for the first time, the weather channel (channel 184) is 
available for 360 days free of charge for test purposes. 

The other channels are blocked by the provider Sirius (not yet subscribed) and therefore 
still show a credit card symbol.

DVD Changer 

The 6-DVD changer is offered as part of the ZPS Premium Sound Package on the 
F01/F02 and it is located above the glove compartment behind the dashboard trim panel. 
A CD Changer is no longer offered. 

The DVD changer forms part of the MOST network. 

A single-slot changer means that the DVDs or CDs are loaded in the unit individually 
without a magazine. 

A DVD can be loaded by pressing the Load button, followed by the button for the DVD 
tray into which the DVD is to be inserted. 

If no button is pressed after the Load button has been tapped, the LED in the tray button 
for the first empty tray flashes. The tray moves into position during this time. Once tray 
positioning is completed, the status display begins to flash and the DVD can be loaded.

The DVD directory is read directly after loading. The contents of the DVD have to be read 
before the next DVD can be inserted by pressing the Load button again followed by the 
button for the DVD tray. 

The guick-load function must be activated in order to load all DVDs one after the other. 

The Load button must be pressed for approximately 2 seconds for this purpose. The 
LEDs in the tray buttons for trays that are empty begin to flash. 

Up to six DVDs can be inserted one after the other, depending on the number of empty 
trays. The contents of the DVDs inserted are read either once the final empty tray is 
occupied, after a timeout period or if the Load or Eject button is pressed. 

The shutter must be open in order to insert the DVDs. The slot lighting flashes when it is 
possible to insert a disk. Operation is described in detail in the Owner’s Handbook for the 
vehicle. 

An individual DVD can be ejected by pressing the Eject button followed by the operating 
button concerned. Pressing and holding the Eject button ejects all the DVDs immediately 
one after the other. 

Supported compressed audio formats: 

• MPEG-1 Layer 3 Audio (MP3) with ID3 tag version 1 and version 2 

• Windows Media Audio (WMA) up to version 9 with WMA tags 

• Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) 

Audio formats that are protected by Digital Rights Management (DRM) cannot be played. 

The data on the DVDs is decoded by the DVD changer and converted into digital MOST 
signals (audio) or analog CVBS picture signals (video). 

If the vehicle is eguipped with the HiFi speaker system, the digital data on the DVD is 
sent to the head unit through the MOST. Here it is converted to analog data and 
output through the HiFi amplifier and the speakers. 

If the Top-HiFi system option is installed, the decoded audio data is sent directly to the 
Top-HiFi amplifier through the MOST. 


91 

F01 Audio Systems 



This direct transmission bypassing the head unit is made possible because data 
conversion and sound adjustment take place exclusively in theTop-HiFi amplifier. 

The analog CVBS (Composite Video Baseland Signal) video signals are sent directly 
through the CVBS link to the CIC. 

In come cases (depending on equipment options installed) all three CIC CVBS inputs are 
already occupied and the video signals are distributed through a video switch (see video 
switch section in this training material for further information). 

The DVD changer is located above the glove compartment, concealed behind the interior 
trim equipped with a flap mechanism. 

The following picture shows the location of the DVD changer with the interior trim open.

USB/Audio Interface 

The “USB/audio interface” supports the playback of audio files stored on mass storage 
devices with USB connections such as USB sticks, MP3 players etc. 

USB is a serial bus system that allows fast and simple connection of terminal devices to 
computer systems. 

The mass storage medium can be found under the “External devices” submenu in the 
“CD/Multimedia” menu of the iDrive. 



Activation of an external USB/audio interface in the center console 

All USB mass storage devices that support the “USB Mass Storage Class” standard can 
be connected. This includes mass storage media for the playback of compressed audio 
files with a USB interface such as MP3 players, USB memory sticks, etc. The Apple 
iPod® is also supported as from the 4th generation version. 

Due to the large number of devices on the market, no guarantee can be given that every 
available “USB Mass Storage Class” device will function through the USB interface. If a 
device of a different device class is connected, the message “Incompatible device” will 
appear. 

When a USB mass storage device is connected, the contents of the device are read and 
the folder structure is processed for display on the CID. A plausibility check is performed 
as to whether the tracks can be played by the vehicle’s sound system. 

Only those tracks that can be played are displayed. 

While the database of the content (details of the music tracks is constructed, the music 
files can only be selected by navigating through the folder structure. On completion of the 
database, music tracks can also be selected by genre, artist and album. 

Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is currently not supported. MP3 players that use MTP are 
therefore not supported. More information on the protocols used can be obtained from 
the operating instructions of the mass storage device.

F01 Audio Systems 



WARNING!!! 


With certain mobile phones, Bluetooth is deactivated 
if they are connected to the vehicle through the USB 
interface. 


Note: It is not recommended to use mobile phones via the USB interface in the 
center console (Option 6FL). The Smartphone Integration Option 6NF is 
better suited for this purpose and is described in the following pages. 


The following compressed file formats are normally supported with fixed and variable bit 
rates: 

• MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3) with ID3 tags Version 2 

• Windows Media Audio (WMA) with WMA tags 

• Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) 

The WAV file format is also supported. USB mass storage devices must be formatted 
using the FAT file system. If more than one partition (logical drive) has been set up on the 
device, only the first partition is supported. 

The USB mass storage device cannot be accessed if the files are password-protected or 
are subject to Digital Rights Management (DRM). 


94 

F01 Audio Systems 



iPod® Connection 

When music tracks are to be played back using the Apple iPod® the iPod must be 
connected through an adaptor cable that simultaneously uses the auxiliary jack socket 
and the USB. 


The y-cable (cable adapter for iPod®; BMW part number 61 12 0 429 645) included with 
the vehicle. 

With the adaptor cable, the USB connection is used to control the iPod® and the jack 
socket for audio playback. 

The reason for this method of connection is that music tracks obtained from Tunes® 
(Apple music portal) are subject to DRM and can only be played on the device to which 
they were downloaded. The copyright protection prevents digital transmission of the 
music track via USB. 


If a video file is selected on the iPod®, only the sound track is played. If other supported 
USB mass storage devices are used, video files are not displayed. 

It is only possible to access the files on the mass storage device using the Drive when 
the USB mass storage device is connected to the USB interface. If the mass storage 
device is connected using the Audio jack plug, the Drive cannot be used to operate the 
device. 


AUX-in connection (USB/jack 3.5 mm) of option 6FL in the center console of the F01/F02 



Note: USB hard drives must not be connected to the USB interface due to their 
high power draw. It is not permissible for hard disks to draw their power 
supply from the vehicle’s electrical system (e.g. from the cigarette 
lighter socket) and can cause faults.

“USB/audio interface” Components 

“USB/audio interface” consists of the following components: 

• Interface box High (ULF-SBX-High) 

• USB hub 

• Audio socket with USB interface 

• Application software in the head unit 

The USB interface is on the center console and is protected by a sliding cover. 

Simultaneous use of the USB interface and the 12 V socket for charging the mass 
storage device is not recommended. 

Depending on the USB lead used, the mass storage device may be able to be charged 
through the USB interface. However, the power consumption of the mass storage device 
must not exceed the maximum level of 500 rmA permitted by the SBX High. 

The (SBX High) interface box is capable of performing the following tasks: 

• USB connection for USB/audio interface 

• Bluetooth interface with hands-free mode and phone book 

• Basic voice input and activation system through the telephone

The ULF-SBX High interface box is always fitted if the “USB/audio interface” is fitted to 
the vehicle. 

Although both the ULF-SBX-H and the TCU may be fitted in a vehicle at the same time, 
the TCU always provides the telephone functions. The telephone functions are not avail¬ 
able in the ULF-SBX High and the module is only installed to provide the "USB audio 
interface" option. 

The (TCU) and the (ULF-SBX-H) interface box control units are connected to the MOST 
bus. 

The ULF-SBX-H decodes the digital audio signals collected through the USB interface. 
The audio files are then broadcast through the MOST. 

The analog LF (low freguency) signals from the audio socket are also broadcast on the 
MOST. 

The audio signal is transmitted digitally on the MOST bus to the HiFi amplifier and the 
amplifier distributes this signal to all the vehicle’s speakers. 

The ULF-SBX High supports USB 1.1 with the following technical data: 

• Maximum data rate: 12 Mbit/s 

• Voltage: 5 V 

• Current: 500 mA 

The ULF-SBX High is located in the luggage compartment on the left-hand side.

Smartphone Integration 

It is now possible to connect to and play back (through the iDrive system) music tracks 
stored in a mobile phone. Currently, only the iPhone may be integrated in the vehicle 
network by means of the Smartphone Integration audio link. 

Smartphones may be connected through the USB Y cable or through the installation of a 
Smartphone integration snap in cradle adapter, available as option 6NF. 

The audio files can be selected and played from the submenu "External devices" in the 
"CD/Multimedia" iDrive menu 

This feature works independently from the iPod/USB interface. 

The new AUX-ln connection features an internal switch function to accommodate both 
the USB interface and the Smartphone integration options. 

It is possible to select audio from the snap in cradle or, switch to an external audio device 
connected to the (AUX) audio jack or Y-cable to the ULF-SBX-High. The second switch 
position is triggered by inserting a plug in the (AUX) jack. 

The electronic control module is installed in the base plate of the phone cradle. The 
link to the USB hub and AUX-ln connection are already integrated in the vehicle wiring 
harness.

The audio data of the snapped in cradle adapter for the mobile phone is controlled by a 
four-core USB data cable. 

The base plate and cradle specifically developed for the Smartphone Integration option 
(6NF) is immediately recognizable by the two gold-plated pin connectors. 

These two gold-plated pin connectors are also used as lock pins for the snap-in cradle 
adapter. 

Plastic pins are used in the same position in the standard snap-in telephone cradle 
adapters. 

In this way it is possible to distinguish at a glance whether the correct base plate is
