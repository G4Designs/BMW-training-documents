F01 Comfort Access 


Introduction 


Keyless Vehicle Access 

Using Comfort Access, the customer can unlock and open the vehicle without active use 
of the ID transmitter. Access to the vehicle can be gained from any point. It is important 
that the ID transmitter be located in the vehicle’s immediate vicinity (approximately 5 
feet). It is sufficient to have the ID transmitter somewhere on your person. 

Comfort Access was first introduced on the E65 (03/2002). The system was then gradu¬ 
ally introduced on different BMW models. There were the 1 Series, 3 Series, 5 Series, 

6 Series, X5 and X6. 

The F01/F02 will have Comfort Access from the start of series production in 09/2008. 
Comfort Access can be ordered as an option. 

The benefits of Comfort Access are: 

• High level of convenience when unlocking and locking the vehicle 

• Convenient and fast access to the vehicle 

• Simple engine start/stop procedure 

• Maximum comfort for the driver 

• No more annoying hunting for keys. 

The Comfort Access in the F01/F02 is based on predecessor systems and is adapted to 
the F01/F02. However, the entire function is now located in the Car Access System 4. 
For this reason, there is no separate control unit for Comfort Access in the F01/F02, in 
contrast to previous systems. 

The vehicle is unlocked when you place your hand into the handle recess on the outside 
of the door and opened when you pull the door handle. 

You can lock the vehicle again by subsequently pressing on the sensitive surface of the 
outside door handle. 

For vehicles fitted with Soft Close Automatic, the Soft Close Automatic drive fully closes 
the vehicle door. You can then lock the vehicle again by subsequently pressing on the 
sensitive surface of the outside door handle. 

The ID transmitter must be located in the vehicle interior in order for the engine to be 
started. The engine can now be started by pressing the START-STOP button and the 
vehicle is ready to be driven. 

Note: In vehicles with automatic transmission, the brake pedal must be 
depressed in order for the engine to be started. 

In vehicles with manual transmission, the clutch pedal must be 
depressed in order for the engine to be started.

Functions 


Function Overview 

Comfort Access is divided into the following functions: 

• Passive Entry 

• Passive Go 

• Passive Exit. 

ID transmitters are required for Comfort Access to function. 

An ID transmitter comprizes, among other things: 

• A battery 

• Remote control function 

• Transponder coil for emergency start function 

• Mechanical key 

• Receiver unit. 

Remote Control Function for Comfort Access 

When the unlocking or locking button on the ID transmitter is pressed, it emits an 
encrypted remote control signal. The antenna in the rear window forwards the remote 
control signal to the diversity module. The diversity-module remote control receiver 
demodulates, processes and then sends the signal to the Car Access System on the 
LIN bus. 

If the vehicle is in sleep mode, the remote control receiver wakes the Car Access 
System to reduced consumption mode via the LIN bus. The Car Access System thus 
receives the request that was sent using the ID transmitter. The ID transmitter is 
checked by the remote control receiver at this stage. If the result of the check is positive, 
the remote control receiver forwards the request via the LIN bus. If the request is 
authenticated, the Car Access System wakes the vehicle and initiates the unlocking or 
locking of the vehicle. To do so, the Car Access System issues the release signal for the 
junction box electronics to actuate the central-locking drive. 

The ID transmitter can also be used to open the trunk separately. For this, only the 
button with the open trunk symbol need be pressed. 

The Car Access System is responsible for communication via the LIN bus. The diversity 
module therefore only forwards the LIN bus signal if prompted to do so by the Car 
Access System 4. This applies to a vehicle that is not in sleep mode.

F01 Comfort Access 




































Passive Entry enables access to the vehicle without the ID transmitter being actively 
operated. 

For example, if the outside door handle is pulled, this triggers a pulse in the sensor. 

The outside door handle electronics analyze the sensor and inform the Car Access 
System that vehicle access is requested. 

The Car Access System prompts the ID transmitter to identify report to the vehicle. 

For this, a low-frequency signal is emitted by Comfort Access via the antennas. 
Transmission is via the 125 kHz antennas. 

The 125-kHz signal serves only to wake the ID transmitter. The ID transmitter responds 
with its transmission frequency. Subsequent communication is now bi-directional, i.e. in 
two directions. The Car Access System sends or receives all further information via the 
LIN bus. 

The remote control receiver is equipped with both a receiver unit and a transmitter unit. 

It establishes the connection with the ID transmitter via the rear-window antenna. For that 
reason, only the high frequency range is now used. 

Bi-directional communication has the advantage that data can be requested from or sent 
to the ID transmitter. The Car Access System has sole responsibility for this communica¬ 
tion. 

If the ID transmitter is able to be authenticated, the Car Access System initiate the 
request, e.g. unlocking the vehicle. The junction box electronics execute the unlocking. 

The transmission frequency of the ID transmitter varies for the US is 315MHz. 

Note: When it is not required, the ID transmitter is in sleep mode. This reduces 
its energy consumption. For sleep mode to be ended, the ID transmitter 
requires a wake-up signal. The wake-up signal can be sent by the Car 
Access System via the Comfort Access antennas. Pressing one of the 
buttons on the ID transmitter also wakes it. 

Passive Entry at the Trunk 

An authentication check also takes place before the trunk is opened. 

If the outside trunk button in the trunk handle strip is operated, it changes its status. 

The junction box electronics analyze the status and send it via the K-CAN2. 

The Car Access System 4 therefore knows that the outside trunk button has been oper¬ 
ated. 

The Car Access System initiates the emission of the 125 kHz signal, so that the ID trans¬ 
mitter can report to the vehicle. 

At the same time, the Car Access System initiates communication to the ID transmitter. 


12 

F01 Comfort Access 



The Car Access System sends the requests for this via the LIN bus to the remote control 
receiver. The latter sends the requests from the Car Access System via the rear-window 
antenna. 

If the ID transmitter is recognized as belonging to the vehicle, the Car Access System 
prompts the junction box electronics to unlock the trunk.

Passive Go 


The “Passive Go” function makes it possible to start the vehicle when the ID transmitter is 
in the passenger compartment. 

Issuing Start Enable 

Authorization to start the engine is only given when there is an ID transmitter in the vehi¬ 
cle. Once the last door is closed, the Car Access System begins its search for a valid ID 
transmitter. 

The Car Access System 4 requests a signal to be sent out to identify a valid ID transmit¬ 
ter. The interior antennas are used for this. 

The ID transmitter responds using a high-frequency range (315 MHz). If the ID transmit¬ 
ter is authenticated, the Car Access System 4 grants permission for the engine to be 
started. 

Note: The electronic immobilizer gives its own approval for the engine to be 
started. 

The search for an ID transmitter in the passenger compartment can also be triggered 
by pressing the START-STOP button. This will take place if the START-STOP button is 
pressed before the last door is closed, for instance. 

Or if the vehicle is stationary too long and therefore loses communication with the ID 
transmitter. Pressing the START-STOP button triggers the search for the ID transmitter 
in the vehicle interior. 


14 

F01 Comfort Access 



Passive Exit 

The Passive Exit function makes it possible to lock the vehicle without actively using the 
ID transmitter. 

Locking Procedure 

After the vehicle door has been closed, the locking procedure is started by pressing the 
sensitive area on the outside door handle. The outside door handle electronics module 
sends the reguest to unlock the vehicle to the Car Access System 4. 

The Car Access System 4 checks whether a valid ID transmitter is in the vicinity of the 
outside door handle using the outside antennas. 

The ID transmitter is instructed to send an authentication signal. 

In turn, the identification sensor sends encrypted data via the high-freguency link to the 
remote control receiver. 

The remote control receiver processes the data and sends it via the LIN bus to the Car 
Access System. The Car Access System causes the communication with the ID trans¬ 
mitter to be established. 

If the ID transmitter is recognized as belonging to the vehicle, the Car Access System 4 
issues authorization for the vehicle to be unlocked. 

The junction box electronics activate the central-locking drives. 


15 

F01 Comfort Access 



Special Comfort Access Functions 

The Comfort Access additionally features the special functions described in the following 
that are determined by the actions of the vehicle user. 

Second ID Transmitter Remains in the Vehicle Interior 

By checking via the interior antennas, the Car Access System 4 recognizes whether there 
is a valid ID transmitter in the vehicle interior. If the Car Access System 4 detects a valid 
ID transmitter in the vehicle interior and the vehicle is locked by means of another valid ID 
transmitter (located outside), the ID transmitter located in the vehicle interior is set to 
"blocked". 

This ID transmitter will not be recognized as belonging to the vehicle for Comfort Access 
until the vehicle is unlocked again. 

Note: The "blocked" status only applies to the functions of Comfort Access. 
The remote control functions are still available. 

Identification Transmitter in Luggage Compartment 

If an ID transmitter is located in the luggage compartment when the vehicle is locked and 
the trunk open and the trunk is then closed, the trunk will immediately be automatically 
opened again. Audible and visual signals draw the customer's attention to the fact that 
the ID transmitter is located in the luggage compartment. 

The Car Access System 4 starts the reguest via the luggage-compartment antennas. 

If a valid ID transmitter is detected in the luggage compartment, the Car Access System 
4 will not issue authorization for the trunk to be locked. 

The trunk cannot be closed before the ID transmitter has been removed and is located 
outside the luggage compartment. 

Note: This behavior only occurs if the Comfort Access does not find a valid ID 
transmitter in the vicinity of the vehicle when it searches the outside of 
the vehicle. 

Starting the Engine without an ID Transmitter 

This function makes it possible to start the vehicle within 10 seconds after “engine OFF” 
without detecting the ID transmitter. This function is intended for cases where, for exam¬ 
ple, the ID transmitter is not detected due to high-freguency interference. 


16 

F01 Comfort Access 



Unintentional Wake-up Function 

The vehicle cannot be woken simply by someone gripping the outside door handle. A 
valid ID transmitter must be detected in the vicinity of the vehicle. 

Locking with Engine Running 

The vehicle can also be unlocked with the engine running if the engine was started with 
Passive Go. When leaving the vehicle, the ID transmitter should also be taken and the 
vehicle locked from the outside. 

Emergency Start Coil 

In unfavorable situations, the ID transmitter cannot be found in the passenger compart¬ 
ment. The Car Access System therefore causes a message to be output to the instru¬ 
ment cluster. The message tells the customer that the ID transmitter could not be found. 

Because there is no slot for the ID transmitter in the F01/F02, there is an emergency start 
coil on the steering column. Communication via the emergency start coil allows the 
engine to be started and the vehicle is then ready to be driven. 

The emergency start coil has the same function as the transponder coil. Communication 
via the transponder coil makes it possible for the Car Access System 4 to identify the ID 
transmitter. The Car Access System 4 can issue the start authorization following success¬ 
ful identification. 

The remote control or ID transmitter cannot be found in the following situations: 

• Fault in the remote control/ID transmitter 

• Interference in the transmission to the remote control/ID transmitter 

• Flat battery in the remote control/ID transmitter.

Control Elements 

ID Transmitter 

The ID transmitter for Comfort Access must be actuated by means of a radio signal. 

The ID transmitter is therefore equipped with a receiver for the coded 125 kHz radio 
signal that is transmitted by the Comfort Access antennas. The radio signal wakes the ID 
transmitter. The ID transmitter registers with the vehicle automatically (authentication). 

For this purpose, the ID transmitter emits a coded 315 MHz high-frequency signal to 
enable identification of the ID transmitter as being valid and belonging to the vehicle. 

The ID transmitter is exclusively responsible for use of the Comfort Access system. 

The ID transmitter has a battery, the service life of the battery in the ID transmitter is 
about 4 years. 

Voltage Monitoring 

The ID transmitter monitors its own battery voltage. The battery voltage is monitored in 2 
stages. 

The first stage signals to the Car Access System 4 that the battery is flat. In response, the 
Car Access System 4 generates a check control message. The check control message 
informs the customer that the battery needs to be changed. 

If the battery is not changed, the voltage monitoring facility switches to the second stage. 
This means that the data in the ID transmitter is saved. The ID transmitter is then set to 
“inoperative”.

Data for Conditioned Based Service 

From terminal status “terminal 15 ON”, data for the Conditioned Based Service is trans¬ 
ferred to the ID transmitter in the high-frequency range. The ID transmitter then confirms 
that the transmission was received. 

Antennas for Comfort Access 

Eight antennas are installed for the Comfort Access system. Five antennas are for the 
vehicle interior and three are for the vehicle exterior. 

The antennas for the exterior and interior are inductive antennas and have a ferrite core. 

The antenna transmission frequency is 125 kHz . All messages that are sent via the 
antennas are encrypted. 

Antenna Installation Locations 
Exterior antennas 

The exterior antennas are installed in the following locations on the F01/F02: 

• Door sill on the driver’s side, in the center of the vehicle 

• Door sill on the front-passenger side, in the center of the vehicle 

• Rear bumper in the center 



Passenger-compartment antenna in the door sills in the F01/F02 

The antennas are designed to give about 5 feet (1.5 m) of coverage around the vehicle. 
The exterior antennas are equipped with a splash-proof plug connection. 

Interior antennas 

The interior antennas are installed in the following locations in the F01/F02: 

• Passenger compartment, front center console 

• Passenger compartment, middle center console 

• Luggage compartment, left and right 

• Parcel shelf 

20

The luggage-compartment antennas are of the same design as the interior antennas. 
They are integrated in the left- and right-hand sides of the luggage compartment. 

The luggage-compartment antennas are configured so that they cover the entire luggage 
compartment.

F01 Comfort Access 


Outside Door Handle Electronics Module 


The outside door handle electronics are connected to terminal 30F and work within a 
voltage range of 9 V to 16 V. The Car Access System is directly connected to the data 
line of the outside door handle electronics. This provides the Car Access System with 
information about the capacitive sensors and the piezo sensors. The status of the “pull” 
Hall sensor is monitored directly by the Car Access System. 

The outside door handle electronics detect the status of the outside door handle using 
the sensors. 

Each change in the status of the outside door handle module triggers the corresponding 
function. 

These functions are: 

• Trigger pulse by inserting a hand into the handle recess of the outside door handle; 
Capacitive sensor 1 

• Unlock request by pulling the outside door handle; Hall sensor 

• Lock request by pressing the sensitive area on the outside door handle; capacitive 
sensor 2 plus piezo sensor. 

Sensors 

Capacitive sensor 1 

If a hand is placed into the handle recess of the outside door handle, for example, this is 
detected by the outside door handle electronics. On detecting this, the outside door han¬ 
dle electronics send the request to the Car Access System. The request initially contains 
the information to wake up the Car Access System. The Car Access System is woken 
and reads the request. Then, the Car Access System establishes communication with the 
ID transmitter. 

The Car Access System switches the remote control receiver on permanently and there¬ 
fore ensures that the data sent by the ID transmitter can be received. 

Note: The remote control receiver is integrated in the diversity module. 
Capacitive sensor 2/piezo sensor 

Touching the sensitive surface generates the capacitive sensor 2 signal. Together with 
the piezo sensor, a press on the sensitive surface is detected. A lock signal is only trig¬ 
gered if the capacitive sensor and piezo sensor are both actuated. 

The outside door handle electronics analyze the two sensors and send the request to the 
Car Access System. 


22 

F01 Comfort Access 



Outside door handle Hall sensor 

The Hall sensor is redundant to the capacitive sensor 1. The Hall sensor is analyzed 
directly by the Car Access System. The Car Access System monitors the Hall sensor 
using a clocked voltage supply. 

If the vehicle has already been woken by someone reaching into the handle recess, 
pulling on the outside door handle triggers the unlocking on the vehicle. 

In unfavorable situations, it may be necessary to pull on the outside door handle twice to 
trigger the vehicle unlocking. This is caused if the signal from the capacitive sensor 1 is 
not present or is implausible. 

Door Locks 

The vehicle has rapid opening locks in the doors as standard. A spring exerts pretension 
on the central locking drive for the unlocking procedure. The door is already unlocked 
before an attempt is made to open it with the outside door handle. 

Note: However, if the outside door handle is pulled very fast, the vehicle door 
may not yet be unlocked. In this case, it is necessary to pull the outside 
door handle a second time in order to open the door.
