Introduction 


History 

Voice-activated control was offered for the first time as an option for the E38. The sys¬ 
tem enabled the driver to operate the telephone and the navigation system without tak¬ 
ing his or her eyes off the road and the traffic situation. 

As the voice recognition system evolved, the number of spoken command the system 
could recognize increased by leaps and bounds from the initial 30 to the current figure of 
about 470 (CCC with the “Voice Activation” option in the E60, E90). This means that in 
the current models, voice control can be used not only for the telephone and the navi¬ 
gation system, but also for entertainment, the address book, the air-conditioning func¬ 
tions and vehicle individualization settings. 

Voice Activation is standard equipment on the F01/F02 and it is always combined with 
the “Navigation System”. 

Note: The Voice Activation System and the “Navigation System” 
are both standard on the F01/F02.

The Voice Activation system has been further enhanced. 

There is now an even larger range of spoken commands and for the first time the user 
has the option of individualizing the voice recognition system in accordance with specific 
needs and preferences. For example, users can match the voice recognition system to 
their own knowledge base and use the controller to change the spoken-language setting. 

Other innovations of the voice activation system include: 

• Visual feedback in the instrument panel. 

• No audible beep signal during a dialog with the system. 

• Combined mode with both voice inputs and controller inputs. 

• Intersections and zip codes can be entered as destinations. 

• Voice control of contacts, phone book and address book with up to 3000 entries.

System Overview 


The following pages show the input/outputs and the schematic circuit diagrams of the 
F01/ F02 voice input and activation systems. 

The driver’s side microphone is the only device used for voice input. 

Voice input is always activated by pressing the PTT button (push-to-talk button) on the 
steering wheel. 

The control units, sensors, control elements and components involved in the system are 
shown in the input/output diagrams. A block diagram representation of a specific control 
unit is additionally shown. 

The input/output diagram provides an overview of the system in the form of a signal flow 
diagram. It does not indicate whether the signals are sent via busses, other control units, 
hard wiring or by wireless means. This detailed information can be found in the schemat¬ 
ic circuit diagram. 

The graphic representation is always followed by the corresponding legend which can 
be found either under the graphic or on the next page. 

For the sake of clarity the various individual speakers are not shown in the schematic cir¬ 
cuit diagrams.

The DVD changer serves as an example of the other voice-activated systems 
that can be controlled. 

The wheel speed signals are used for speed- dependent volume control. 

Volume can be adjusted by means of the multifunction steering wheel and the IHKA/ 
audio control unit. Speed-related volume control is also active. 

The microphone is connected to the TCU and the telephone commands are processed 
by the telephone control unit and made available on the MOST bus.

System Functions 


What can be operated by voice input? 

In the F01/F02, broadly speaking all the menus that can be viewed in the CID can be 
voice-controlled to the second level of a menu. 

The graphic below shows the first level of the “Navigation” menu on the left, and the 
second level on the right. 

Direct entry to the first level of the menu is a possibility for reducing the length of 
operating time needed to activate a particular function. This is done by saying aloud a 
term from the menu in guestion. Instead of having to say first "Navigation" and then 
"Destination entry", the user can simply say "Destination entry" to go directly to this 
function. The command is executed regardless of which menu is currently open.

F01 Voice Activation System 














Standard and Short Dialogs 

Until now, all voice recognition systems have suffered from the drawback of appearing 
complicated to inexperienced users (beginners). The difficulties were due to the fact that 
the user was unaware of how many voice commands were available, or failed to enunciate 
the commands correctly and completely. 

Experienced users (experts) on the other hand, had the advantage of knowing how to use 
the system guickly by using short commands. 

In order to ensure that users in both these groups can use the system to their 
satisfaction, in the F01/F02 it is possible to select a “Standard” dialog for inexperienced 
users or a “Short” dialog for experts. 

The “Standard” dialog provides detailed information while operation is in progress, but 
the “Short” dialog dispenses with this information for the sake of rapidity. 

Example: 

Standard dialog: 

SYSTEM: “Say the name of a place” 

USER: “Munich”- shows up on the display 
SYSTEM: “Did you mean “Munich”?” 

USER: “Yes” 

Short dialog: 

SYSTEM: “Place” 

USER: “Munich”- shows up on the display 
SYSTEM: “Did you mean “Munich”?” 

USER: “Yes”

The dialog setting can be toggled between standard and short by selecting “Settings” 
“Language/units”.

Language/units 
Language Setting 

The current voice recognition systems do not offer the customer the option of changing 
the input language without expert assistance. The car has to be brought to the workshop, 
where BMW Service can change the language setting. The language is changed either 
by recoding or by replacing the appropriate control unit. 

The new 7 Series BMW enables the customer to change not only the display language 
but also the input and output language of the voice activation system by means of Drive. 

The full range consists of eight languages: 

• English (UK) 

• French 

• German 

• English (US) 

• Italian 

• Spanish 

• Dutch 

• Japanese 

All eight languages are saved on the hard disc. 

Depending on the national-market specification, however, only three different languages 
are selectable with Drive. The other languages can be activated by coding. 

The menu item for changing the language setting is: 

“Setting” - “Language/units”.

F01 Voice Activation System 




No beep after each step in a dialog sequence 

Until now, before enunciating a command the 
user always had to wait for a confirmation beep 
marking the conclusion of a system message. 

This does not conform to the natural flow of 
speech, and often results in errors because the 
user speaks too soon. 

In the F01/F02 there is no beep between the 
individual steps in a dialog seguence. There are 
now only two audio signals: One signal confirms 
the start of a dialog seguence and sounds 
immediately after the user presses the PTT 
(push-to-talk) button on the steering wheel. 

A second signal sounds to mark the end of 
the dialog.

Visual feedback in the instrument panel 

In addition to the acoustic feedback issued by 
the voice input and activation system, the user 
also receives visual confirmation of the result 
(e.g. after enunciating the command “New num¬ 
ber” via the instrument panel. The system’s 
input prompt “e.g. Enter digits” appears at the 
same time in the instrument panel. 

Conseguently, the user has improved orientation 
and can more easily follow the sequence of 
functions and the changes from menu to menu 
in the CID.

Combined mode with voice and iDrive inputs 

This new function enables the user to operate the system by a combination of spoken 
commands and iDrive actions. 

Until now, voice input has always aborted as soon as the controller was used to select an 
entry. This meant that the user had to press the PTT button again in order to resume 
voice input to complete the sequence. 

In the F01/F02 the voice-input dialog remains open even if the controller is moved, so the 
user can immediately resume voice input to continue interacting with the system. This 
makes it much easier, for example, to enter a destination for the navigation system by 
selecting a street name from a list. 

Extended destination entry in navigation 

Voice-assisted destination entry has been extended in the following ways: 

• Entry of intersections spoken command 

• Entry of Zip codes 

Voice control with up to 3000 entries 

Until now, the phone book was the only administration function for which voice input 
could be used. In the F01/F02 it is now possible to use spoken commands to adminis¬ 
trate the contacts, phone book and the address list. This means that three lists with up to 
3000 entries can be operated by voice control.

System Components 


The voice input and activation system is implemented in the following control units: 

• Telematics Control Unit (TCU) 

• Voice input and activation system 

-CIC 

The voice-input commands are transmitted via MOST or the central gateway module 
(ZGM) to the receiving control unit. 

Voice output consists of recorded audio signals stored in the control unit for the voice 
input and activation system. The audio signals are then made available on the MOST 
bus in the form of digital signals. 

TCU 

The TCU used on the F01/F02 is an evolved unit based on the TCU from the E70.

The Voice Activation system supports all the menus viewable on the CID. Voice control 
also extends to the second level of the menu tree. 

The CIC has eight languages, all saved on the internal hard disc. Three of these 
languages are user-selectable by Drive. The other languages can be activated by coding. 

The volume of voice output can be adjusted by means of the multifunction steering 
wheel and the IHKA/audio control unit. 

The CIC is mounted behind the IHKA/audio control panel in the instrument panel.
