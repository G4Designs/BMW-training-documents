Introduction 


BMW Steering Systems - Innovative and technically always some¬ 
thing special! 

Since the introduction of the first EPS electric power steering system on the E85 in 
2002, the variety of technical innovations on steering systems has rapidly expanded. 
Before then the following systems were used: 

• Hydraulic power steering 

• Speed-sensitive power steering (Servotronic) 

The next major step with steering systems then came with the E60 and the revolutionary 
Active Steering system, which not only had the Servotronic function but also incorporat¬ 
ed speed-sensitive modulation of the steering angle. 

BMW also improved the electric power steering (EPS) system and used it in a variety of 
forms. 

The main difference between hydraulic and electric power steering is in the method of 
generating the power assistance force that reduces the amount of force that the driver 
has to apply to the steering wheel. 

In order to further inventively optimize the advantages of Active Steering on the new 7 
Series, Integrated Active Steering has now been developed and is described in this 
document.

System Overview 

Integrated Active Steering 


General Details 

Integrated Active Steering is an innovative and logical development of the Active 
Steering system developed by BMW. 

With Active Steering, a steering angle amplification factor reduces the steering effort on 
the part of the driver and combines the capabilities of “steer by wire” systems with 
authentic steering feedback. 

By intervening in the steering independently of the driver’s actions, it is also able to per¬ 
form a stabilizing function in terms of vehicle handling. 

In order to move further ahead in terms of handling dynamics, the familiar Active Steering 
has now been logically extended by the addition of active rear-wheel steering on the new 
BMW 7 Series. 

Active Steering of the rear wheels is a logical extension of Active Steering and the two 
are now combined as an all-in one system referred to as Integrated Active Steering. 

Integrated Active Steering is available as an option on the F01/F02 because the stan¬ 
dard steering system is the Servotronic.

Functions 


Steering Systems 

Implementation of the Integrated Active Steering function has essentially been made 
possible by the new ICM system complex on the F01/F02. 

The Servotronic function including valve control is also taken over by the ICM control 
unit. That steering control function is also influenced by the Driving Dynamics Control 
function. 

Advantages of Integrated Active Steering: 

• Extension of Active Steering (AL) by the addition of rear-wheel steering (HSR) 

• Variable steering-gear ratio (steering angle amplification factor) 

• Independent control of rear-wheel steering angle (steer by wire) 

• Servotronic 

• Handling stabilization functions 

• Reduction of braking distance under split surface braking conditions. 

Supply of Signals 

Signals from external sensors 

The ICM control unit reads the following signals that are essential to the Integrated 
Active Steering from external sensors: 

• Four wheel-speed signals sent via Flexray by the DSC 

• Steering angle sent via Flexray by steering column switch cluster 

• Status of AL and HSR actuators transmitted via Flexray. 

However, because the rear-wheels are steerable, the steering angle of the front wheels 
alone is not definitive for dynamic handling control purposes. Therefore, the ICM control 
unit also takes the steering angle of the rear wheels into account. Ultimately, the effec¬ 
tive steering angle is calculated from the two steering angles (front and rear wheels). The 
effective steering angle indicates the angle to which the front wheels would have to be 
turned to bring about the same vehicle response without steerable rear wheels. That 
variable is the easiest for all vehicle systems to use to analyse the steering action. 

Control and Modulation of Steering 

Both the basic steering system and the optional Integrated Active Steering on the 
F01/F02 incorporate the Servotronic function. That speed-sensitive power assistance 
function is effected byway of the Servotronic valve on the steering gear. 

The Servotronic valve is always controlled by the ICM control unit regardless of the 
eguipment options fitted. Accordingly, the Servotronic function algorithm is stored on 
the ICM control unit. 

16 

F01 Lateral Dynamics Systems 




Similarly regardless of equipment options, the steering system also always incorporates a 
proportional control valve which is controlled by the ICM control unit. With the aid of that 
valve, the power steering pump’s volumetric flow rate can be electronically adjusted. For 
that reason it is also referred to as the “electronic volumetric flow control” valve 
(EVV valve). 

That valve too is controlled by the ICM control unit. Depending on the degree of power 
assistance demanded at the time, the volumetric flow rate delivered by the power steer¬ 
ing pump is split between the steering valve and a bypass circuit. The ratio of that split 
can be infinitely varied. The less power assistance is required, the more hydraulic fluid is 
diverted into the bypass circuit. As the hydraulic fluid does not have to do any work in the 
bypass circuit, less power is required to drive the power steering pump. Consequently, 
the proportional control valve helps to reduce fuel consumption and C0 2 emissions.

Higher-level Dynamic Handling Control 


Centralized Dynamic Handling Control 

The interventions by the dynamic handling control systems are performed with the aim of 
improving agility and traction. Quite obviously, they also re-stabilize the vehicle when 
reguired. On previous vehicles the various functions were performed by a number of 
discrete systems which, although they communicated with one another, nevertheless had 
strictly defined limits to their spheres of operation. Accordingly, the interaction of all 
systems which ultimately determines the overall handling response, was difficult to har¬ 
monize.

F01 Lateral Dynamics Systems 


























The Integrated Chassis Management system on the F01/F02 employs centralized 
dynamic handling control. It compares the vehicle response desired by the driver with the 
actual motion of the vehicle at that moment. By so doing, it is able to determine whether 
and in what way intervention in the dynamic handling systems is reguired. 

The output variable of the centralized dynamic handling control system is a yaw force. It 
brings about a yawing motion on the part of the vehicle that is superimposed over the 
existing movement of the vehicle. In that way, the behavior of the vehicle can be “correct¬ 
ed” if a difference from what is desired by the driver is detected. The classic examples of 
that are vehicle understeer or oversteer. 

A new feature of the ICM on the F01/F02, however, is that the dynamic handling systems 
are brought into action even before such a discrepancy is detected. Thus, the interven¬ 
tions by the dynamic handling systems take place long before the vehicle becomes 
unstable. As a result, the vehicle feels much better balanced than would be achievable 
with a conventional suspension and steering set-up. The vehicle displays neutral handling 
characteristics in many more situations and does not even begin to under or oversteer. 
This new function is made possible by very precise computation models and new control 
strategies by which the handling characteristics can be assessed and influenced. 


19 

F01 Lateral Dynamics Systems 



Co-ordinated Intervention by the Dynamic Handling Systems 

The possibilities for intervention available in the past (and, of course, still available now) in 
order to generate the required yaw force calculated by the central dynamic handling 
controller are listed below. In brackets in each case are the dynamic handling systems 
concerned. 

• Modulation of individual brakes (DSC) 

• Adjustment of engine torque (ASC+T, DSC, MSR) 

• Adjustment of front-wheel steering angle independently of driver input 
(Active Steering). 

Subordinate to the centralized dynamic handling control system is an “actuator coordina¬ 
tion” function. It decides which dynamic handling system can be used to produce the 
yaw force in the particular situation concerned. 

For example, if the vehicle is exhibiting significant understeer, it can be counteracted by 
controlled braking of the rear wheel on the inside of the bend. If the vehicle has 
Integrated Active Steering, the same effect can be brought about even more harmo¬ 
niously by steering the rear wheels to an appropriate degree. 

As both means of intervention are limited in their degree, it can also be useful to use 
them both simultaneously. Avoidance of understeer is noticeable to the driver in the 
shape of a significant gain in agility. 

The F01/F02 is also the first model on which there is true functional networking between 
the Integrated Chassis Management and vertical dynamics management functions. But 
that doesn’t simply mean that the ICM registers the ride height data, processes it and 
passes to the VDM. 

An integral component of the dynamic handling control system is that the ICM also 
actively initiates the Dynamic Drive function in order to affect the self-steering character¬ 
istics. As is familiar from conventional suspension and steering designs, a stiffer anti-roll 
bar results in a lower achievable overall lateral friction force at the pair of wheels con¬ 
cerned. The actuator motors in the Dynamic Drive anti-roll bars can be used to simulate 
the effect of stiffer and more flexible anti-roll bars. 

Thus the ICM centralized dynamic handling control system can use the Dynamic Drive’s 
active anti-roll bars to selectively control the available lateral friction force at a pair of 
wheels. If the vehicle is oversteering, that means there is too little lateral friction force on 
the rear wheels. In that case, it is better to reduce the roll limiting force on the rear sus¬ 
pension. In return, there is a gain in lateral friction force on the rear wheels which helps to 
stabilize the vehicle. 

The input/output diagram on the following page summarizes the effect of the centralized 
dynamic handling control functions on the ICM control unit.

F01 Lateral Dynamics Systems 





















The Integrated Chassis Management is the control unit which computes the higher-level 
dynamic handling control functions for the Integrated Active Steering. 

From the current vehicle handling status and the desired course indicated by the driver, 
the Integrated Chassis Management calculates individual settings for the variable steer¬ 
ing-gear ratio and the superimposed yaw rate. Once they have been prioritized, the ICM 
provides a reguired setting in each case for the AL and HSR control units. The setting 
specified is a reguired steering angle to be applied to the front and rear wheels respec¬ 
tively. 

The AL control unit receives the reguired setting and has the main job of controlling the 
actuators so as to correctly apply the specified setting. Thus the AL Active Steering 
control unit is purely an actuator control unit. The same applies to the HSR control unit. 
It too is an actuator control unit. Like the AL control unit, it is responsible only for imple¬ 
menting the reguired steering angle specified by the ICM. 

With the introduction of the ICM on the E71, this type of function distribution was used 
for the first time. On the F01/F02, it has been expanded to the extent that 

• the ICM now controls all linear and lateral dynamics systems (AL, HSR and also 
DSC) and 

• the ICM is the master control unit both for linear dynamics and unstable handling 
situations. 

The interface between the Integrated Chassis Management and the Dynamic Stability 
Control (DSC) represents a special case.

Functional Areas of Integrated Active Steering 


Low Speed Range 

The variable steering-gear ratio of the Active Steering component reduces steering effort 
to approximately 2 turns of the steering wheel from lock to lock. In the low speed range 
up to approximately 37 mph, the variable steering-gear ratio for the front wheels is 
combined with a degree of opposite rear-wheel steer. The effect is to increase vehicle 
agility.

When the steering wheels of a vehicle are turned, it follows a curved path around what is 
called the momentary axis “M”. 

In the case of conventional vehicles, that momentary axis is positioned at a point along 
the extension of a line passing through the center of the rear wheels. 

Active Steering intervention turns the rear wheels in the opposite direction at speeds up 
approximately 37 mph.

The conseguence of the rear-wheel steering intervention is that the axis of rotation 
moves closer to the center of the vehicle with the same amount of steering effort. 

In terms of agility and dynamic handling, that is eguivalent to a vehicle with a shorter 
wheelbase. 


25 

F01 Lateral Dynamics Systems 















High Speed Range 

As the vehicle speed increases, the degree of steering angle amplification by the Active 
Steering component is reduced. The steering-gear ratio becomes less direct. 

At the same time, the steering strategy adopted by the Integrated Active Steering 
changes. Whereas, at low speeds, the rear wheels are steered in the opposite direction to 
the front wheels, at higher speeds the rear wheels are steered in the same direction as 
the front. 

The momentary axis moves further back, equivalent to a vehicle with a longer wheelbase, 
producing more stable straight-line handling. The radius of the curve becomes longer. 

By the combination with the Active Steering, an additional amount is added to the steer¬ 
ing angle of the front wheels so that the radius of the curve and the required amount of 
steering lock remain at the familiar level.

All in all, co-ordination of the steering interventions at front and rear makes lane changes 
and steering maneuvers considerably easier to negotiate without sacrificing agility or bal¬ 
ance. 

Combination of the Active Steering with the new rear-wheel steering system offers bene¬ 
fits for the driver at all speeds.

Handling Stabilization by Integrated Active Steering When Understeering 

When changing lanes guickly, all vehicles have a tendency to produce a significant yaw 
response and can sometimes start to oversteer. 

If the ICM dynamic handling controller detects a difference between the response 
desired by the driver and the reaction of the vehicle, it initiates co-ordinated steering 
interventions on the front and rear wheels. The speed of the stabilizing intervention is 
such that it is hardly discernible by the driver. 

Braking interventions by the DSC, which have a decelerating effect, can be largely dis¬ 
pensed with. 

The end result is that the vehicle is more stable and more effectively damped.

F01 Lateral Dynamics Systems 























If the driver underestimates how sharp a bend is when driving quickly on a country road, 
he/ she can be caught out by sudden understeer. 

By virtue of its inherent features, Active Steering was only able to react to vehicle over¬ 
steer. 

Integrated Active Steering incorporating active rear-wheel steering is now also able to 
make corrective interventions when the vehicle is oversteering and thus further increases 
active safety. 


29 

F01 Lateral Dynamics Systems 



Handling Stabilization by Integrated Active Steering Under Split Surface 
Braking Conditions 

Hard braking on road surfaces which provide less grip for the wheels on one side of the 
vehicle than on the other causes the vehicle to yaw towards the side with more grip.

F01 Lateral Dynamics Systems 



















































Under emergency braking, the driver of a conventional vehicle then has to correct the 
vehicle’s course. 

Under such split surface braking conditions, the dynamic handling controller generates a 
stabilizing yaw force by opposite steering interventions on the front and rear wheels. 

A) Without DSC 

In the case of a vehicle without DSC, maximum braking effect is achieved by the wheels 
on the dry side of the road, while those on the wet or icy side produce very little retarda¬ 
tion. 

As a result, a very substantial yaw force acting in an counterclockwise direction is pro¬ 
duced, causing the vehicle to swerve to the right. 

B) With DSC 

A vehicle eguipped with DSC brakes the individual wheels more sensitively in order to 
keep the yaw force within manageable limits for the driver, which however, slightly 
increases the braking distance. 

C) With DSC and AL 

The additional “yaw force compensation” function represents a significant safety feature. 

When braking on road surfaces with differences in frictional coefficient between one side 
of the vehicle and the other (tarmac, ice or snow), a turning force is generated around the 
vehicle’s vertical axis (yaw force) rendering the vehicle unstable. In such cases, the DSC 
calculates the reguired steering angle for the front wheels and the Active Steering imple¬ 
ments it by actively applying opposite lock. 

As a result, an opposing yaw force around the vertical axis is generated, “compensating” 
for the original yaw force (cancelling it out, i.e. the vehicle is stabilized by intelligent co¬ 
ordination of DSC brake modulation and AL steering, constituting a safety feature unigue 
in this class of vehicle). 

D) With DSC, dynamic handling controller and Integrated Active Steering 

Under such split surface braking conditions, the dynamic handling controller generates a 
stabilizing yaw force by opposite steering interventions on the front and rear wheels. 

That counteracts the slewing of the vehicle caused by the uneven braking forces. 

At the same time, maximum braking force can be applied in order to achieve a short brak¬ 
ing distance. 

Integrated Active Steering is a logical development from the Active Steering systems. 

The functions of the systems complement each other perfectly, taking the driving experi¬ 
ence to a new dimension. 


31 

F01 Lateral Dynamics Systems 



Integrated Active Steering Special Function 

Quite obviously, Active Steering systems must not be capable of being switched on or off 
by the driver. 

In the case of Integrated Active Steering, there is a special feature in that regard because 
if snow chains are fitted to the rear wheels, Active Steering of the rear wheels must be 
disabled. 

When snow chains are fitted, the rear-wheel steering is deactivated in order to ensure 
that the wheels are always free to rotate. 

Automatic snow-chain detection assists the driver and indicates the detected status on 
the Control Display. This does not remove the responsibility for manually changing the 
setting.

When show chains are used, the setting on the iDrive Settings menu must be changed 
to “Show chains fitted”. 

If the maximum speed of 50 kph (31 mph) for driving with snow chains is exceeded, the 
rear-wheel steering is reactivated regardless of the “Snow chains fitted” setting. 

Automatic snow chain detection 

It is possible to detect from the wheel-speed sensor signals a characteristic pattern pro¬ 
duced by the motion of the wheel when show chains are fitted (only with BMW-approved 
show chains). From that characteristics signal pattern, the control unit is able to detect 
whether show chains are fitted on each individual wheel.

HSR actuator 




The special actuator on the rear suspension is fixed underneath a mounting plate on the 
rear suspension subframe. 


The electromechanical actuator is positioned between the two new track rods of the 
Integral V rear suspension. The rear-wheel steering system has its own actuator control 
unit which is responsible for controlling and monitoring the actuator. 

It was previously the state of the art that control systems were largely independent of one 
another. 

On the F01/F02, the Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) system brings the separate 
systems together. 

A central ICM control unit in the ICM architecture replaces the previous dynamic handling 
sensors and forms a central dynamic handling controller.

The electromechanical actuator essentially consists of an electric motor which moves the 
two track rods by means of a worm-and-nut steering gear. 

The actuator is designed for a maximum travel of ±8 mm, which brings about a maximum 
steering angle of ±3 ° at the roadwheel. 

The worm-and-nut rear-wheel steering gear is self-inhibiting. That means that if the sys¬ 
tem fails, the vehicle adopts exactly the same handling characteristics as a vehicle without 
rear-wheel steering.
