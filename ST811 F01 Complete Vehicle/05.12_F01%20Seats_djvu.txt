Introduction 


Front Seat Equipment 

The front seating arrangement of the F01/F02 consists of the multi-function seat as 
standard equipment. The multi-function seat (Comfort Seat) features 16-way adjust¬ 
ment with 4-way lumbar support which includes the articulated upper backrest, 
adjustable backrest width, adjustable thigh support, and Active Head Restraints with 
adjustable side support. 

The front seat also have memory settings for the driver and passenger seats. 

An electropneumatic system is installed for lumbar support and the active seat. The 
advantage of electropneumatics lies in the fact that the overall weight of the seat is 
reduced. 

The active seat is a part of the Luxury Seating package and features pneumatic control 
rather that the previous fluid based control system on the E65. 


f ^ 



The front side airbag (1) is integrated into the backrest of the driver’s and front passen¬ 
ger seat. The seat back extends into the seat side. This is known as “encompassing seat 
wall”. When the airbag is triggered, the side is pushed a little. This allows the airbag to 
open and provide its protective function. The front seats are equipped with seat-occu¬ 
pancy recognition (passenger) and a belt tensioner. 

In the F01/F02, the button for the passenger-assist function (gentleman function) is inte¬ 
grated into the armrest of the driver’s door. After pressing the button, the driver is able to 
operate the front-passenger seat using his own seat adjustment buttons. 

5 

F01 Seats 





For example, this allows you to make more space, e.g. before someone gets in on the 
passenger’s side. 

The front seats are equipped with crash-active head restraints. In the memory seat, the 
head restraints have a button for adjusting the distance to your head. 

In the multifunction seat, the distance is adjustable using the upper backrest adjustment. 

Rear Seat Options 

In the F01/F02, there are two seat models, the basic seat and the optional comfort (multi¬ 
function) seat. The rear comfort seat is part of the “Luxury Rear Seating” package which 
also includes the rear ventilated seats. 

On the F02, there is also a “stand-alone” option for the massage function. 

All seat equipment comes with the center armrest cup holder. There are two styles for the 
center armrest. See the following comparison.

Multifunction Seat 

The optional massage function can be ordered additionally with the multifunction seat. 
The massage function is based on current medical knowledge and is integrated into the 
backrest. 

The multifunction seat helps you to feel perfectly refreshed, for example with a back mas¬ 
sage on a stressful day. 

So that customers are provided with the best sense of well-being, they can select from 
two different massage intensity levels. 

A new feature of the seat air conditioning function in the multifunction seat is that only 
two fan motors are installed for the ventilation. The fan motors draw in some fresh air from 
the rear footwell. The fresh air is then guided via air ducts through the multifunction seat 
until it reaches the backrest and seat surfaces. This helps to provide a pleasant air-tem¬ 
perature control for customers.

Seat position recording in the US 

There is seat calibration in the US version for the driver’s and the front-passenger seat. 
Seat calibration is important, because during the course of many seat adjustments, the 
seat position may lose accuracy. This generates a Check Control message. Refer to the 
section entitled Service information.

Front Seat Memory Function 

The memory function is available for both the driver’s and front-passenger seats. The 
memory buttons are located on the armrest. The memory function can be activated from 
terminal 30B ON. The memory function is integrated into the seat module. The seat 
module of the seat concerned has sole responsibility for this function. 

Two memory positions and the current seat position can be stored. 

The memory buttons are integrated into the armrest of the vehicle’s doors and connect¬ 
ed via the LIN bus to the footwell module. 

The LIN bus is “looped through” the switch block of the driver’s door. This means that 
the LIN bus cable is routed from the footwell module to the switch block in the driver’s 
door. From the switch block in the driver’s door, the LIN bus is routed further to the mem¬ 
ory buttons and the door mirror. 

The footwell module evaluates the button status and sends it via the K-CAN2. 

The footwell module sends the button status via the K-CAN2 to the central gateway 
module. The central gateway module receives the signal and issues it on the K-CAN. The 
seat module evaluates the signal and initiates the storing of the memory position, when 
reguested to do so. 

Press the memory button to prepare for storing the memory position. The seat module 
sends the reguest to switch on the function indicator. From the function indicator, for 
example, the customer can recognize that the memory function is ready for storing.

Pressing the memory "M" button followed by button "1" or "2" assigns the current posi¬ 
tion of the door mirrors and steering column to the pressed button. 


The seat module sends the reguest to store the door mirror and steering column position 
via the K-CAN. The central gateway module transfers the signal to the K-CAN2. The 
footwell module then stores the position. 

14 

F01 Seats 

























The door mirror position is assigned to the memory position of the driver's seat. Due to 
this fact, the current position of the door mirrors is also assigned to the pressed button 
"1" or "2". 

Note: The memory position of the door mirrors and the electric steering col¬ 
umn adjustment are stored in the footwell module. 

Passenger-assist Function 

The passenger-assist function is available from terminal 30B ON. The seat module on the 
driver’s side alone is responsible for the passenger-assist Function. The button status is 
read in by the footwell module via the LIN bus and sent via the K-CAN2. The central 
gateway module transfers the signal to the relevant bus system. 

As soon as the driver’s seat module SMFA detects an operation reguest from the pas¬ 
senger-assist function button, it prepares the front-passenger seat module for an adjust¬ 
ment reguest via the K-CAN. 

When the seat adjustment switch on the driver’s side is now activated, the seat module 
on the passenger’s side executes the reguest. 

The K-CAN is used for communication between the seat modules. This allows all seat 
adjustment functions for the front-passenger seat and the memory function to be operat¬ 
ed from the driver’s seat. The passenger-assist function is available for the memory seat 
and the multifunction seat. 

The seat module sends the reguest via the K-CAN to the function indicator for the acti¬ 
vated passenger-assist function button in order to switch on the LED in the button. The 
reguest must be transferred on more than one bus system. 

Note: A seat adjustment made via the buttons on the front-passenger seat has 
priority over those made from the driver’s seat.

Front Seat Heating 

The seat heating is standard as part of the comfort seats. The seat module is functionally 
responsible for seat heating. 

The seat heating can only be activated from terminal 15 ON. The status of terminal 15 
ON is issued by the Car Access System 4 via the K-CAN2. The junction box electronics 
thus know the status of terminal 15. 

The central gateway module transfers the signal to the K-CAN. The seat module is con¬ 
nected to the K-CAN and receives the status of terminal 15. 

The button for the seat heating is located in the IHKA/audio control panel. The control 
panel is connected to the control unit of the integrated automatic heating and air condi¬ 
tioning system. 


Pressing the seat heating button, selects the heating stage as shown in the following list.

If the button is pressed for longer than 1.2 seconds with the seat heating activated, the 
seat heating will be switched off. 


If, after terminal 15 OFF, the junction box electronics receive the status terminal 15 ON 
within 15 minutes, then the last selected function that was activated will come into opera¬ 
tion. 

The indicator for the selected heating stage is controlled by the seat module. The signal 
must be sent via several bus systems. 

The seat heating module is connected to terminal 30B for the seat-heating load current.

Seat Heating with Seat Module 

When the vehicle wakes up, the junction box electronics determine whether a seat mod¬ 
ule is installed in the vehicle. It sends a corresponding query via the K-CAN2 for this pur¬ 
pose. The central gateway module transfers the signal to the K-CAN. This allows the seat 
module to receive the request, respond to it via the K-CAN and take control of the seat 
heating function. 

The seat module has sole responsibility for the seat heating function. The integrated 
automatic heating and air conditioning system evaluates the button status and sends the 
button status via the K-CAN to the seat module. 

The seat module evaluates the requests for the desired heating stage, as well as controls 
and monitors the seat heating functions. The seat-heating pads are connected to the 
seat module. A NTC resistor in the seat-heating pad is monitored to control the tempera¬ 
ture. 

Depending on the heating stage, the seat module sends the request for the function to 
be indicated in the button LEDs to the integrated automatic heating and air conditioning 
system. 

The seat module is connected to terminal 30B for the seat-heating load current. 

A fault in the seat-heating system results in a corresponding entry in the fault memory of 
the driver’s seat module. 

Power reduction of seat heating 

The energy management system in the vehicle can activate the seat heating at a reduced 
power level corresponding to the vehicle’s energy balance. The energy management is 
located in the digital engine-control system. 

The digital engine control sends the request to reduce power via the PT-CAN. The cen¬ 
tral gateway transfers the information to the KCAN. This allows the seat module to receive 
the request to reduce power. 

The reduction stages are: 

• Operation of seat heating in Stage 2 

• Operation of seat heating in Stage 2 at only 50% 

• Seat heating OFF. 

Note: In the event of a power reduction, the LEDs in the seat-heating buttons 
are not switched off. 

During a starting cycle (terminal 50 ON) or when the seat adjustment switch is operated, 
the seat module prevents the seat heating from functioning. The LED indicator for the 
activated seat heating remains lit.

Heating Circuit for the Seat Heating 

The F01/F02 seats are equipped with a two-circuit seat heating system. 


Two-circuit seat heating system 

A seat-heating pad is located in the surface of the backrest. Two seat-heating pads are 
integrated into the seat surface. Both seat-heating pads are supplied with power by the 
seat module. 

There is a NTC resistor in each seat-heating pad in the backrest and seat surfaces. This 
serves as a temperature control.

Front Lumbar Support 

Using lumbar support, the backrest can be individually adapted to the spinal column and 
thus ensures relaxed driving. Lumbar support is a standard feature in the multifunction 
seat. 

The button for the lumbar support adjustment is located on the side of the front seat and 
is connected via the LIN bus to the seat module. The function of the lumbar support is 
integrated completely in the seat module. The lumbar support is adjustable from terminal 
30B ON.

The seat module reguests the button status for the lumbar support adjustment via the 
LIN bus an on a cyclical basis. Lumbar support is provided by two inflatable air cushions 
in the backrest. The desired air cushion is inflated with air or deflated via two solenoid 
valves until such time that the button for the lumbar-support adjustment is released. 

The pump for lumbar-support adjustment delivers the reguired air pressure. The pump 
and the solenoid valves are activated from the seat module. 

Note: Seats with the lumbar support option are generally fitted with a seat 
module. For this reason, all seat heating or seat adjustment functions 
are located in the seat module. 

The seat adjustment switches are read in from the seat module via the 
LIN bus. 


19 

F01 Seats 









Front Active Seat 


Active seat function can be activated from the status terminal 15 ON with the Active Seat 
button. The button is located in the armrests of the front door of the vehicle. 

The seat module has sole responsibility for this function. 

The footwell module requests the button status via the LIN bus and sends this via the 
K-CAN2. The central gateway transfers the signal to the K-CAN. This allows the seat 
module to receive the button status. The seat module evaluates the button status. 

If there is a request to switch on the active seat, then this is executed by the seat module.

A powerful pneumatic pump is used for the active seat and lumbar support functions. 
The pump supplies the air cushion, for the lumbar support and the active seat with the 
required volume of air. For this reason, the pump is somewhat larger than that which is 
found in a vehicle without the active seat option. 

Note: Lumbar-support adjustment has priority over the active seat. For lum¬ 
bar-support adjustment, the pump for lumbar-support adjustment runs 
at maximum speed. For the active-seat function, the pump for lumbar 
support adjustment runs at roughly half this speed.

Four air cushions are integrated in the seat surface for the active seat. Two air cushions, 
one on top of the other, are used in both the left and right seat halves. 

The air cushions are inflated with air supplied by the pump for the lumbar-support adjust¬ 
ment. A solenoid valve is integrated in the pump unit. The function of the solenoid valve 
is to change over the air supply. This ensures that only one function (lumbar support 
adjustment or active seat) is ever executed. 

A distributor module is available for inflating the air cushions. The seat module delivers 
power to the distributor module as soon as the active seat is switched on. 

The distributor module houses a motor, which drives an eccentric shaft. The rotation of 
the eccentric shaft causes the air inlets to the seat cushions to open or close. 

The seat cushions are alternately inflated or deflated, depending on the position of the 
eccentric shaft. The air inlets are closed when the system is switched off and in the 
breaks between inflation or deflation. 

A switch contact is integrated in the distributor module to switch on the pump for lumbar- 
support adjustment. The rotation of the eccentric shaft actuates the contact, which there¬ 
by signals activation to the seat module. The seat module switches on the pump for lum¬ 
bar-support adjustment and changes over the solenoid valve to inflation of the seat cush¬ 
ions. 

Undervoltage 

If the function fails due to undervoltage when the active seat is switched on, the active 
seat must be calibrated. The function does this by itself. The seat cushions are complete¬ 
ly deflated the next time the active seat is switched on. The active-seat function is then 
ready for operation again. 


23 

F01 Seats 
















Suspension of functions 

In the interest of avoiding irritation when cornering at high speed, the active-seat function 
is stopped immediately in the event of excessive lateral acceleration. 

The lateral-acceleration signal comes from the yaw-rate sensor. The Integrated Chassis 
Management issues the signal via the FlexRay. 

The central gateway module transfers the signals to the K-CAN. This allows the seat 
module to receive the signal for the vehicle’s lateral acceleration. The seat module can¬ 
cels activation when a defined threshold is exceeded. The function indicator however 
remains lit. 

The active seat is switched on again when the lateral-acceleration value drops again. 

Power management 

Power management is capable of briefly stopping the active seat from functioning. The 
function indicator however remains lit. 

This applies, for example when pressing the starter or to maintain a sufficient energy bal¬ 
ance for the vehicle’s electrical system. 

System faults 

In the event of a system fault, the system shuts down or stops in the next center position 
in order to avoid further damage. A fault memory entry is stored in the seat module.

Active Seat Ventilation 


The active seat ventilation option provides the occupants with individual climate control 
for the seat and backrest surfaces. 

Active seat ventilation is available for both the driver’s and front-passenger seats. Active 
seat ventilation can be activated from the status terminal 15 ON. 

Stage 3 is engaged when the button is pressed for the first time. This sets the maximum 
fan stage for seat and backrest. 

The next stage lower or OFF is selected on further pressing of the button. Active seat 
ventilation is deactivated if the button remains pressed for longer than 1.2 seconds.

The button for the active seat ventilation is located in the IHKA/audio control panel. The 
seat module has sole responsibility for this function. The integrated automatic heating 
and air conditioning system evaluates the signals for operating the active seat ventilation 
and sends the button status to the seat module. This allows the seat module to receive 
the request, activate the fan and monitor their operation. 

Depending on the heating stage, the seat module sends the request for the function to 
be indicated in the button LEDs to the integrated automatic heating and air conditioning 
system. 

Nine fans are accommodated in each seat. The fans are switched on by the seat module 
and activated separately for backrest and seat surface. For active ventilation, the seat has 
two speed stages for the fans, depending on the air-conditioning stage. The seat surface 
has five fans, while the backrest has four fans.

Rear seat heating 

The seat heating is available for the left and the right seat and each has a heating circuit. 
A seat-heating pad is located in each backrest and seat surface. The seat heating can 
only be activated from “terminal 15 ON”. 

The seat-heating buttons are integrated under the air vents in the rear center console. 

The seat heating function is fully integrated into the junction box electronics. 

The junction box electronics evaluate the buttons for the seat heating. To do this the 
junction box electronics reguest the current status of the buttons via the LIN bus. 

The junction box control unit then transfers the status to the appropriate seat heating 
module. 

The seat heating modules are connected to the junction box electronics via the LIN bus. 

Note: The seat heating modules are coded to detect the installed position. 
Different pins are switched to terminal 31, i.e. to ground for coding. 

The connectors are coded. 

The buttons and the seat heating modules are connected to terminal 30B. 

The fuses for the buttons and seat heating modules are located in the distribution box in 
the luggage compartment. 


The seat heating can be switched on in three heating stages. The heating stages and 
their indications are set out in the following table.

Power reduction of seat heating 

The energy management system in the vehicle can activate the seat heating at a reduced 
power level corresponding to the vehicle’s energy balance. The energy management is 
located in the digital engine-control system. 

The digital engine control sends the request to reduce power via the PT-CAN. The cen¬ 
tral gateway transfers the information to the K-CAN2. The junction box electronics thus 
know about the request for power reduction. 

The junction box electronics send the request for power reduction to the seat heating 
module. 

The reduction stages are: 

• Operation of seat heating in Stage 2 

• Operation of seat heating in Stage 2 at only 50% 

• Seat heating OFF. 

Note: In the event of a power reduction, the LEDs in the seat-heating switch 
are not switched off. 

During a starting cycle (terminal 50 ON), the seat heating module prevents the seat heat¬ 
ing from functioning. The LED indicator for the activated seat heating remains lit.

The rear-compartment comfort seat also has lumbar support. The comfort seat is also 
known as the multifunction seat. 

The seating in the rear-compartment is designed for two persons to increase comfort. 

As with its predecessor, the F01/F02 has the seat adjustment switch and memory but¬ 
tons in separately installed positions. 

The seat-adjustment switches are located on the center armrest and are connected via 
the LIN bus to the seat module. The button for adjusting the lumbar support is located 
next to the seat adjustment switches. 

The memory buttons are integrated into the armrest of the vehicle’s rear doors. The 
memory buttons are connected to the junction box electronics via the LIN bus. 

As previously described with the basic seat, the comfort seat also has a method of trans¬ 
ferring signals from the seat heating button that differs depending on the eguipment 
installed on the vehicle. 

The rear-compartment comfort seat can comes with the ventilation feature. Additionally, 
there is a “stand-alone” option for the massage function. 


31 

F01 Seats 











Electric Seat Adjustment for the Rear-compartment Comfort 


The comfort seat has the following electric seat adjustment options: 

• Seat-inclination adjustment 

• Longitudinal seat adjustment SLV (seat distance to front seat) 

• Head-restraint height adjustment 

• Backrest-inclination adjustment 

• Backrest head-inclination adjustment LKV. 

The comfort seat has a large seat module that is integrated into the backrest of the seat 
concerned. All seat adjustment switches are read in by the seat module via the LIN bus. 
The seat module has sole responsibility for the seat functions. It controls and monitors 
the function seguences. The seat position of the comfort seat can be adjusted from ter¬ 
minal 30 ON. 

Note: The seat module is connected via the K-CAN for communicating with 
other persons in the vehicle electrical system. 

The seat module reguests the status of the seat adjustment switches via the LIN bus. 

The seat module activates the adjustment motors in according to the status of the seat 
adjustment switches. The adjustment motors are activated via the relay in the seat mod¬ 
ule. 

When the seat adjustment switch is released, the seat module cancels activation. The 
seat module also cancels activation when the adjustment motor is obstructed or when 
the end position is reached. 

An obstructed motor is detected by the current measuring device integrated into the seat 
module and by failure of the Hall sensor pulses. In this case, the relays are no longer actu¬ 
ated thus shutting down the motors. The seat module also blanks out these adjustment 
motors when storing the memory position. 

Once the motors are unobstructed, they are available to the memory function again. 

The seat module stores the malfunctions. In the service workshop, the fault code entry is 
read out using the diagnostic system. 

Fault code memory entries can be: 

• Short-circuiting 

• Line breaks 

• Adjustment motor or Hall sensor is defective.

Other Seat Functions 


Reset function 

The reset function enables you to set the comfort seat to a pre-set seat position. After 
the reset button is pressed, the seat automatically moves into position. It can be used to 
make the seat more easily accessible during servicing. This, for example, is of benefit to 
customers and service technicians, because getting out of the vehicle and accessing the 
comfort seat becomes easier. 

Note: The reset function can also be used for fitting a child seat. After the reset 
function is activated, the comfort seat is in a better position for fitting 
the child seat.

Position detection 

The adjustment motors are eguipped with Hall sensors. The Hall sensors generate Hall 
pulses during activation, which are evaluated by the seat module. The seat module calcu¬ 
lates the fixed distance intervals based on the Hall pulses and determines the current 
seat adjustment position. 

The seat position is stored in the seat module and used for the memory position. 

Obstruction detection 

The seat module records the Hall sensor pulses of the adjustment motors. If the adjust¬ 
ment motor is obstructed the Hall sensor pulses will fail. The seat module also detects an 
obstructed motor from the increased current when the obstruction occurs. The seat 
module then cancels activation of the adjustment motors. 

The adjustment motor can be activated in the same direction again. If the motor remains 
obstructed, it must be activated in the opposite direction. If the seat can be moved in the 
opposite direction, then the seat module allows you to activate the original direction 
again. 

If the obstruction in the adjustment motor cannot be cleared, then this motor is no longer 
used to store the memory function.

Rear seat adjustment button 

In unfavorable situations, the leg room behind the front-passenger seat can seem quite 
narrow. Someone sitting behind the front-passenger seat may find this unpleasant. 

In order to enlarge the space in front of the rear seat on the front-passenger’s side, there 
is an additional button fitted on the center armrest in the rear seat area. This button 
allows you to operate the front-passenger seat. 

The rear seat module behind the front-passenger seat requests the button status via the 
LIN bus. 

This enables it to detect when the button is pressed. If the button is pressed, the rear 
seat module behind the front passenger seat prepares itself to carry out a seat adjust¬ 
ment to the front-passenger seat. 

When the seat adjustment buttons for the rear seat are now operated, they adjust the 
front-passenger seat accordingly. 

The function is deactivated by pressing the button for operating the front-passenger seat 
again. 

Note: A seat adjustment made via the buttons on the front-passenger seat has 
priority over those made from the rear seat.

Memory Function for the Rear-compartment Comfort Seat 

The memory function is available for both the left and right rear passenger seat and can 
be activated from terminal 30B ON. The memory buttons are connected to the junction 
box electronics via the LIN bus. 

The seat module of the seat concerned is responsible for the memory function. The junc¬ 
tion box electronics request the status of the memory buttons via the LIN bus on a cycli¬ 
cal basis. To enable the seat module to read out the status of the memory buttons, the 
button status must be transferred on several bus systems. The bus systems are: 

• LIN bus (JB > buttons) 

• LIN bus (buttons > JB) 

• K-CAN2 (JB > ZGM) 

• K-CAN (ZGM > SM). 

Press the memory button to prepare for storing the memory position. The seat module 
sends the request to switch on the function indicator. From the function indicator, for 
example, the customer can recognize that the memory function is ready for storing. 

Pressing button “1 ” or “2” assigns the current position of the driver’s seat to the pressed 
button. One memory position is available for each of the buttons “1 ” and “2”. 

The data is assigned to the current ID transmitter as part of the Personal Profile, when the 
memory position is stored. 

If the seat module detects an obstructed adjustment motor, then memory adjustments to 
the motor remain disabled until the motor is no longer obstructed.

When the vehicle wakes up, the JBE determine whether a seat module is installed in the 
vehicle. It sends a corresponding query via the K-CAN2 for this purpose. The central 
gateway module transfers the signal to the K-CAN. 

The ZGM transfers the signal to the K-CAN. This allows the seat module to receive the 
request, respond to it via the K-CAN and take control of the seat heating function. This 
means that the button status of the seat heating is evaluated, and the seat heating is acti¬ 
vated and monitored. 

The JBE request the button status for the seat heating via the LIN bus on a cyclical basis 
and sends it via the K-CAN2. The ZGM transfers the request for the heating stage to the 
K-CAN. The seat module evaluates the request for the desired heating stage and acti¬ 
vates the seat heating accordingly. The seat heating is a two-circuit heating system. 

Function indicator 

In order to indicate that the seat heating function has been activated, the seat module 
sends a request via the K-CAN to switch on the LEDs in the button. The request must be 
transferred on more than one bus system. 

The bus systems are, K-CAN (SM > ZGM), K-CAN 2 (ZGM>JB) and LIN (JB>buttons): 

Back lighting buttons 

The FRM sends the status of the terminal 58g ON via the K-CAN2. This is how the junc¬ 
tion box electronics receive the status of terminal 58g ON. The JBE send the status of 
the terminal 58g ON to the seat heating buttons via the LIN bus. 

Power reduction of seat heating 

The energy management system in the vehicle can activate the seat heating at a reduced 
power level corresponding to the vehicle’s energy balance. The energy management is 
located in the digital engine-control system. 

The digital engine control sends the request to reduce power via the PT-CAN. The ZGM 
transfers the information to the K-CAN2. 

The JBE then receive the request for power reduction and initiates it. 

The reduction stages are: 

• Operation of seat heating in Stage 2 

• Operation of seat heating in Stage 2 at only 50% 

• Seat heating OFF. 

Note: In the event of a power reduction, the LEDs in the seat-heating switch 
are not switched off. 

During a starting cycle (terminal 50 ON) or when the seat adjustment switch is operated, 
the junction box electronics prevent the seat heating from functioning. The LED indicator 
for the activated seat heating remains lit.

Lumbar Support in the Rear-compartment Comfort Seat 

Lumbar-support Adjustment 

Using the lumbar support, the backrest can be individually adapted to the spinal column 
and thus ensures relaxed driving. 

The button for the lumbar support adjustment is located on the side of the center armrest 
and is connected via the LIN bus to the seat module. 

The lumbar support function is fully integrated into the seat module and is adjustable 
from terminal 30B ON. 

The seat module reguests the button status for the lumbar support adjustment via the 
LIN bus an on a cyclical basis. The button responds with the current status via the LIN 
bus. 

The seat module evaluates the button status and if necessary activates the lumbar sup¬ 
port pump and solenoid valves. 

Lumbar support is provided by two inflatable air cushions in the backrest. The desired air 
cushion is inflated with air or deflated via four solenoid valves until such time that the but¬ 
ton for the lumbar-support adjustment is released. 

The pump for lumbar-support adjustment delivers the reguired air pressure. The pump 
and the solenoid valves are activated from the seat module. 

The seat module stores the malfunctions with the lumbar support. In the service work¬ 
shop, the fault code entry is read out using the diagnostic system. 

Fault code memory entries can be: 

• Short-circuiting 

• Line breaks 

• Motor is defective.

Active Seat Ventilation for the Rear-compartment Comfort Seat 

The active seat ventilation allows the passenger to have individual cooling of the seat and 
backrest surfaces. 

In the F01/F02, a new concept has been introduced for the active seat ventilation. This 
concept reguires only two fans for each seat. The integrated automatic heating and air 
conditioning system provides the vehicle with climate-controlled air. This means there is 
sufficient fresh and climate-controlled air in the footwell in front of the rear seats. The fans 
draw some air from the footwell. The drawn-in air is routed via each air-conditioning pad 
to the seat and the backrest. 

The active seat ventilation is available for the seat and backrest on the rear comfort seat 
and can be activated from status terminal 15 ON. 

The seat module has sole responsibility for the active seat ventilation function. Stage 3 is 
engaged when the button is pressed for the first time. This sets a high fan stage for seat 
and backrest. 


The next fan setting or OFF is selected on further pressing of the button.

The air intensity of the active seat ventilation is coupled to the fan setting of the automat¬ 
ic rear-compartment air conditioning. This makes it possible to harmonize the fan noises 
in the rear compartment. The active seat ventilation therefore reaches its maximum value, 
when the automatic rear-compartment air conditioning is set to the maximum fan setting. 

If the automatic rear-compartment air are activated based on a characteristic map condi¬ 
tioning is not switched on, then the fans that is stored in each seat module.

Switching on the Rear Active Seat Ventilation 

The automatic rear-compartment air conditioning evaluates the button status and sends 
it via the K-CAN. 

The seat module evaluates the status, activates the active seat ventilation with the select¬ 
ed air-conditioning setting, and monitors the function. 

Two fans are fitted in each seat. The fans are activated from the seat module depending 
on the selected setting. 

An activated seat ventilation function remains stored for up to 15 minutes after the status 
terminal 15 OFF. The previously active fan setting for the seat ventilation is switched on 
again if in this time the status terminal 15 ON is received by the seat module. 

The energy management system in the vehicle can deactivate active seat ventilation 
briefly depending on the vehicle’s energy balance. The function indicator is retained how¬ 
ever. 

Function indicator 

In order to indicate that the seat ventilation function has been activated, the seat module 
sends a reguest via the K-CAN to switch on the LEDs in the button. The automatic rear- 
compartment air conditioning switches on the LEDs. 

Back lighting buttons 

The footwell module sends the status of the terminal 58g ON via the K-CAN2. The cen¬ 
tral gateway module transfers the signal to the K-CAN. Then the automatic rear-compart¬ 
ment air conditioning receives the status terminal 58g ON and activates the back lighting. 

Note: The indicators in the control panel of the automatic rear-compartment 
air conditioning use black panel technology. A detailed description of 
the black panel technology can be found in the Product Information 
“F01/F02 display and control elements”.

Air-conditioning Pad 

The air-conditioning pad has openings in the area of the seat and backrest surfaces. 
Air can be drawn in through the openings in order to control the temperature of the 
seat cover. 

Special covers are reguired for active seat ventilation. The covers have very small air 
outlets. 


The air drawn in by the fans can flow through the air outlets. This cools the seat cover 
and ensures that the temperature of the seat cover remains pleasant.

Massage Function in Rear-compartment Comfort Seat 

The optional rear-compartment massage gives the rear-seat passenger even more 
comfort than in the E65. The rear-compartment massage function is being offered in the 
F01/F02 for the first time at BMW. 

An electropneumatic system is used to implement the massage function. 

The massage function is available for both the left and right rear passenger seat and can 
be activated from terminal 30B ON. The seat module is integrated into the back of the 
backrest in the left rear and the right rear seat and has sole responsibility for the massage 
function. 

The buttons for the massage function are connected via the LIN bus to the junction box 
electronics.

The junction box electronics evaluate the status of the massage button and sends the 
status via the K-CAN2. 

The central gateway module transfers the signal to the K-CAN. This allows the seat mod¬ 
ule to receive the current status of the buttons. The seat module evaluates the status, 
activates the massage function, and monitors it. 

In the backrest of the comfort seat, there is a massage pad for the massage function. 
Pressing the button starts the massage function at the maximum massage intensity. 
Pressing the button again switches it to a lower massage intensity level. 

Pressing the button once again switches the massage function off. 

If the button is pressed for longer than 1.2 seconds during the massage function, the 
massage function will be switched off. 

In order to indicate that the massage function has been activated, the seat module sends 
the request to switch on the LEDs in the button. 

The signal terminal 58g ON is made available through the footwell module. The junction 
box electronics pass on terminal 58g ON to the button. The button then switches the 
back lighting on.

Massage 

The massage function is divided into massage cycles. A massage cycle consists of the 
massage and includes back mobilization and lasts approximately 64 seconds. After this, a 
new massage cycle begins. 

There are twelve massage cushions that help to relieve tension in the back muscles 
through a wave-like motion along the backrest from top to bottom. 

The wave-type motion is created by inflating and deflating the massage cushions. The 
pressure distribution module activates the massage cushions in pairs simultaneously. 

The massage function is designed so that the two upper massage cushions are activated 
first. Activation in this situation means inflating and deflating the massage cushions with 
air. Following this, the pair of massage cushions lying beneath are activated and this con¬ 
tinues until the bottom massage cushions are reached. 

Towards the end of the massage cycle, mobilization of the back begins.

Mobilization cushions are used for mobilization. There are six mobilization cushions 
arranged in the outside shoulder area, in the center of the thorax and in the lumbar area. 

The mobilization cushions are simultaneously inflated and deflated periodically and sec- 
tionally. For example, the mobilization cushions in the right shoulder and right lumbar as 
well as the mobilization cushions in the left thorax are pumped up and deflated. Following 
that, the opposite side is inflated and deflated. 

If the lumbar support is set when the massage function has been activated, the seat 
module deactivates the massage function. This allows the pump for the lumbar support 
adjustment to supply enough air flow to inflate the lumbar cushions. 

After the lumbar support has been set, the massage function continues. 

The massage function has a defined run-on. With this run-on the massage cushions and 
mobilization cushions are fully deflated. The run-on encompasses one massage cycle. 


The pump for the lumbar support runs at various speeds depending on the function.

Seatbelt-buckle Switch in the Rear Seat 

The seatbelt-buckle switch signals whether the seatbelt is fastened or not. When the 
seatbelt is fastened, the seat module adjusts the head restraint with an electric motor to 
the previously used head restraint height. 

If the seatbelt has not been fastened, then the head restraint is fully retracted. This 
increases the field of vision out the back window. 

The Advanced Crash Safety Management evaluates the seatbelt-buckle switch and 
sends its status via the PT-CAN. The central gateway module transfers the signal to the 
KCAN. This provides the seat module with information about whether the seatbelt is fas¬ 
tened or not. The seat module sets the head restraint to the maximum height if the seat- 
belt is on, or completely back if the seatbelt is not on.

System Components 

Controls and Control Units 

Controls 

The controls for the seat functions are connected depending on the seat equipment. 
The controls are: 

• Seat-adjustment switches 

• Lumbar support switch 

• Memory buttons 

• Active-seat button 

• Active seat ventilation button 

• Massage function button. 

Refer to the following table: 


Switch/button 

connection 

Application 

Direct 

Seat adjustment motor is directly activated. 

Resistance-coded 

The seat module reads in the switch directly and effects the request triggered by the 
switch. 

LIN-Bus 

The seat module cyclically requests the status of the switch and effects the request trig¬ 
gered by the switch. 

LIN bus > K-CAN2 

For example, the buttons in the armrests are connected to the footwell module or the 
junction box electronics. The control units evaluate the button status and send it via the 
K-CAN2. The signal is transferred from the central gateway module to the K-CAN. 

Control unit > K-CAN 

For example, the button status for the seat heating in the front seats is evaluated by the 
integrated automatic heating and air conditioning system and issued via the K-CAN. For 
example, the button status for the active seat ventilation in the rear seats is evaluated by 
the automatic rear-compartment air conditioning and issued via the K-CAN.

Control Units 

Junction box electronics 

The junction box electronics each have a control outlet for the seat heating. In seat heat¬ 
ing with a seat heating module, the junction box electronics activate the seat heating via 
the LIN bus. 

Note: The junction box electronics cede activation of the seat heating to the 
seat module of the respective seat. 

Seat heating module 

The seat heating module evaluates the LIN bus signal from the junction box electronics. 
The seat heating module is connected by means of three connectors. One connector 
establishes the connection to the junction box electronics. The other two connectors are 
responsible for connecting the seat heating. 

Seat module 

The seat module receives activation information for the seat heating via the K-CAN. 
Similarly, the seat module evaluates the button status of the controls for the various seat 
functions. 

The reguests made by the memory buttons for the door mirror are made available via the 
K-CAN. The positions for seat memory are stored in the seat module. 

The reguirements of the seat-adjustment switches are executed by the seat module.

Seat module 




A pressure distribution module located in the backrest is for inflating and deflating the 
respective massage or mobilization cushions. The pressure distribution module distrib¬ 
utes the air for the massage cycle. There is a motor for this that drives an eccentric shaft. 
The eccentric shaft is designed so that it alternately opens and closes the air inlets and 
outlets of the massage cushions and mobilization cushions. 

The reguired air is supplied by the pump for the lumbar-support adjustment. The seat 
module receives the reguest for the reguired air for the massage function from the pres¬ 
sure distribution module. The pump for the lumbar-support adjustment is activated by the 
seat module. 

Note: Lumbar-support adjustment has priority over the massage function.

Service Information 


Calibration of the Drivers/front-Passenger Seat in the US Version 

The position of the driver’s seat in the longitudinal direction can become implausible in 
the course of that seat’s life. This can be caused by repeatedly moving the seat forward 
and back in the longitudinal direction. 

These movements can give rise to an unauthorized position delta which no longer pro¬ 
vides fora determination of the seat position. 

The seat must therefore be recalibrated. Calibration is easy and can be performed by the 
customer him-/herself. Please refer to the Owner’s Handbook.

Note: The seat must be moved in the mechanical front stop. Then the seat is 
calibrated and can be adjusted in the desired seat position. 


If the seat is unable to reach the mechanical front stop, the calibration 
must be performed in the service garage/workshop. 

This situation can come about if, for example, a coin is stuck in the seat- 
adjustment rail and blocks the adjustment travel. 

If repairs are made to the seat, the seat must always be calibrated. This is necessary to 
guarantee seat-position recognition, or more precisely to increase the safe and reliable 
function of seat-position recognition.

F01 Seats 


















Switching the seat control unit for test purposes for example with one from another vehi¬ 
cle is possible. The seat calibration will be lost however. Because the possibility of the 
calibration being in order when the old seat control unit is reinstalled cannot be ruled out, 
it is necessary to calibrate the seat. Refer to the repair instructions for seat calibration. 

Note: The ACSM receives a message from the seat module once a second as 
to whether calibration of the seat is necessary. 

The signal is transferred in the central gateway module from the K-CAN 
to the PT-CAN. 

As soon as the message contains the information “Calibration neces¬ 
sary”, the ACSM outputs a Check Control message via the PT-CAN to 
the instrument cluster. 

The seat control unit can likewise trigger the Check Control message. This is possible if 
for instance the Hall sensor of the longitudinal drive motor is defective. A repair in the 
garage/ workshop will therefore be necessary. The seat must be calibrated after the repair.

Replacing Components 

The seats consist of a large number of components. For this reason, the components 
can be replaced if one becomes faulty. 

The Repair Instructions must be observed when replacing or making repairs to a seat. It 
is also important that only genuine BMW replacement parts are used. This ensures that 
the seat functions remain intact. 

For example, the motors for the seat adjustment cannot be replaced separately from the 
corresponding output shaft, because they form one electromechanical unit.
