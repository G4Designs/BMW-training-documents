Voltage Supply Overview 

Introduction 

Due to the steady increase of electrical functions for comfort, communication and safety 
in BMW vehicles, the voltage supply is becoming ever more important. 

In the F01/F02, there are two separate fuse carriers. The front fuse carrier is located near 
to the glove compartment and the rear fuse carrier is located on the right-hand side of 
the luggage compartment. 

In the graphic below, you can see the layout of the most important components of the 
voltage supply in the F01/F02.

System Components 

Overview of System Components 

The most important new/modified features of the voltage supply in the F01/F02 are 
described below. The voltage supply in the F01/F02 consists of the following 
components: 

• Vehicle battery 

• Intelligent battery sensor IBS 

• SBK safety battery terminal 

• Distribution box on the battery 

• Rear fuse carrier on the right-hand side of the luggage compartment 

• Battery cables 

• Front fuse carrier, behind the glove compartment 

• Junction box electronics 

• Power distribution box in engine compartment 

• Electronics box in engine compartment 

• Positive battery terminal 

• Alternator 

Vehicle Battery 

The vehicle battery is fitted in the center at the rear of the luggage compartment floor. 
The vehicle battery is always an AGM battery (Absorbant Glass Matt). The AGM battery 
has a capacity of 90 Ah. 

The main advantage of the AGM battery is its higher cycle strength.

Distribution Box on the Battery 

In the F01/F02, the distribution box is located in the luggage compartment directly on top 
of the vehicle battery.

Distribution box on the battery 


The distribution box on the battery is secured on the vehicle battery by means of a metal 
tab. The metal tabs must be pressed downward and outward in order to release the distri¬ 
bution box. 

The distribution box on the battery is equipped with fuses for the following electric loads: 

• Front fuse carrier (250 A) 

• Rear fuse carrier (100 A) 

• Engine compartment distribution box (100 A) 

- large electric fan (850 W or 1000 W) 

• Electric coolant pump (100 A) 

• Intelligent battery sensor IBS.

The distribution box on the battery must always be replaced as a complete unit. 

The fuses are integrated as a complete unit in the housing of the distribution box on the 
battery. The fuses differ in terms of their power rating. The distribution box additionally 
contains the power supply for the intelligent battery sensor IBS. 

The connectors are color-coded and mechanically coded to avoid confusion. These are 
high power connections, therefore always ensure correct contacting!

Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS) 


The intelligent battery sensor (IBS) is a mechatronic component for monitoring the bat¬ 
tery status. The following physical measurements are recorded for the battery: 

• Current 

• Voltage 

• Terminal temperature 

The term “intelligent” means that there is a microprocessor integrated in the IBS. This 
microprocessor calculates and analyses time-critical measured variables. The results are 
then forwarded to the higher-level control units (i.e. DME) via the LIN bus.

Rear Fuse Carrier in the Luggage Compartment 

Due to the large number of consumers and control units in the F01/F02, an additional 
fuse carrier has been fitted in the luggage compartment. 

As well as the fuses, a few relays are plugged in here or soldered to the circuit board. 

If one of the soldered relays is faulty, the rear distribution box must be replaced as a whole 
unit. The connection port of the battery cable is located on the rear of the fuse carrier.

Battery Cables 

In the F01/F02, three main power lines on the underbody run from the distribution box at 
the battery to the engine compartment. One of the main power lines runs via the positive 
battery terminal to the starter motor and to the alternator. 

The second line powers the engine electronics (and electric coolant pump). 

The third line runs to the distribution box in the engine compartment. This distribution 
box supplies the electric fan with power. This line is safeguarded by the high-current fuse 
(100 A) in the distribution box at the battery.

In addition, a battery cable is routed to the front fuse carrier through the vehicle interior. 

The transfer points for the main power cables are located in the luggage compartment. 
The main power lines on the underbody are laid in a protected area to prevent damage.

Front Fuse Carrier 


This section describes the front fuse carrier(1). In the right-hand part of the front fuse 
carrier, there is an opening through which the junction box electronics (2) are connected 
to the front fuse carrier. 

The front fuse carrier is located underneath the dashboard on the right-hand side. 

In order for a fuse to be replaced, the glove compartment must be opened.

Front Fuse Carrier and Junction Box Electronics 


The connection between the front fuse carrier and the junction box electronics is estab¬ 
lished through the opening in the right-hand area of the fuse carrier. An internal plug 
connection provides the electrical connection between the two components. 

Junction box electronics and front fuse carrier in the F01/F02 



When assembled, the two components form a single unit (junction box) consisting of 
the junction box electronics and the front fuse carrier. 

The fuse carrier and junction box electronics components must be replaced separately. 
In addition to the corresponding test modules in the diagnostics, diagnosis cables are 
also available with which electrical measurements can be made directly on the control- 
unit plugs and on the internal interface.

Direct Contacting 

On the distribution boxes, direct contacting to the fuses is carried out. The fuses are 
plugged into the plug connections on the circuit board with a connection. The other plug 
connections are directly connected to the connecting plugs on the wiring harness. 

The advantages of this design modification are: 

• Improved package space utilization 

• Improved heat dissipation.
