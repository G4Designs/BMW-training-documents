F01 Telephone System 




System Overview 


The Telematics Control Unit (TCU) and the interface box ‘High’ (ULF-SBX-H) control 
units are connected to the MOST bus. TCU and interface box ‘High’ may both be fitted 
in the vehicle for certain eguipment options. In this case, the telephone function is always 
implemented in the TCU. 

The head unit transmits the audio signal in analog form to the HiFi amplifier and the 
amplifier distributes the audio output to the loudspeakers in the car. 

The HiFi system is fitted as standard in the F01/F02. 

If the “Top HiFi system” is installed in the car, the audio signal is transmitted digitally on 
the MOST bus to the HiFi amplifier and the amplifier distributes this signal to all the 
loudspeakers. 

Audio playback of the call recipient is via the front right, front left and center loudspeak¬ 
ers. 

For the sake of clarity the various individual loudspeakers are not shown in the schematic 
circuit diagrams. 

The Telematics Control Unit (TCU) used in the F01/F02 is similar to one used in the 
E70. 


The pairing wizard is again integrated in the F01/F02 to assist the customer in pairing 
the mobile phone. 



Note: The specified range of functions will only be achieved with Bluetooth- 
enabled mobile phones recommended by BMW. See a list of compatible 
phones at www.wireless4bmw.com.

Optional extras “USB/Audio interface” and “Smartphone Integration” require the installa¬ 
tion of the ULF-SBX-High Interface box. 

The USB hub is installed only if the car is ordered with the “Smartphone Integration” 
optional extra. 

The mobile phone and the interface communicate via the Bluetooth antenna. 

Voice output by the telephone system is via the vehicle’s front right, front left and center 
loudspeakers. Volume can be adjusted by means of the multifunction steering wheel and 
the CIC. Speed-related volume control is also active. 

Although both the ULF-SBX-H and the TCU may be fitted in a vehicle at the same time, 
the TCU always provides the telephone functions. In this case the telephone functions 
are not available in the ULF-SBX High and the module is only installed to provide the 
"USB audio interface" option.

The TCU receives its power supply via terminal 30F. The power supply via terminal 30F is 
necessary for the provision of the BMW ASSIST services, including for example: 

• Remote Door Unlock 

• Vehicle Finder/Stolen Vehicle Recovery 

• Remote Climate Control. 

These services are implemented via the MOST bus. The TCU reacts to a call from the 
provider, placed at the customer’s request. The TCU sends a signal via the MOST bus to 
the Car Access System (CAS). The CAS then wakes up the vehicle.

Functions 


Bluetooth Pairing (pairing wizard) 

The pairing wizard presents the step-by-step instructions for the entire pairing process 
via the Central Information Display (CID). Detailed help texts and instructions for further 
assistance are available in case pairing is not successful. 

This pairing wizard for Bluetooth is found by selecting the “Telephone” menu and then 
selecting “Bluetooth”. 

Pairing process: 

• Once “Add new device” has been selected, the in-car display shows the Vehicle 
Identification Number (VIN). At the same time, the pairing wizard issues a message 
to the effect that from this point on the mobile phone has to be used in the process. 

• The mobile phone should now be used to search for new Bluetooth devices. 

• If the search is successful, the VIN appears in the display of the mobile phone. 

• The next step is to key a freely selectable PIN code into the mobile phone, and then 
key the same PIN code into the vehicle. 

• If pairing is successful the data of the newly paired mobile wireless device appear in 
the vehicle’s Phonebook. 

• This can take from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on 
how many entries there are in the Phonebook. 

• The telephone entries for the entries from the “Contacts” menu are also shown. 


Up to four mobile phones can be paired with the car. Before a fifth mobile phone can be 
paired, one of the other four entries must be removed from the list. 


Note: Not all system compatible phones are capable of these features. 
For more information see a list of compatible phones at 
www.wireless4bmw.com

F01 Telephone System 




Calls with Multiple Users 

This function can be used to conduct two phone conversations at the same time. 
Services such as call waiting, toggle calls and teleconferencing are possible in this way. 

Call Waiting 

If a second call is incoming while a call is in progress this is indicated by a call waiting 
tone and also by an accept/reject prompt in the display. The user can now reject the 
second call and continue the active call or accept the second call. In which case the first 
caller will hear a call waiting melody and is placed on hold. 

Toggle Calls 

When calls with multiple users are in progress, one call can be “active” and one “on 
hold”. 

The “toggle calls” function can be used to toggle these calls between the “active” status 
and the “on hold” status. 

Display showing active calls 



Teleconference 

If the user has an active call and a call on hold, the "Conference" menu item can be 
selected to place all phone users in a shared conference call.

Phonebook Contacts 
Contacts 

All contact information can be viewed and saved under ‘Contacts’. Contacts transferred 
from the user’s mobile phone to the car are also listed here. A symbol after the contact 
shows where the information for this contact is saved. When the mobile phone is 
removed from the car the contacts from the phone/ Bluetooth pairing can no longer be 
selected in the vehicle.

only be transferred from the mobile phone to the car if the former supports the PBAP 
(Phone Book Access Profile) function.

Phonebook 

The entries in the Phonebook show only contacts for which a phone number has been 
saved. These can be either entries from mobile phones or contacts saved in the car. Up 
to four telephone numbers can be saved for each contact and the individual numbers 
retrieved using the Phonebook functionality.

Smartphone Integration 

The “Smartphone Integration” optional extra enables the customer to play back audio 
files saved on a mobile phone. The option adds a USB port to the telephone base plate 
snap in cradle. The mobile phone can be connected to the car with a compatible snap-in 
cradle adapter, with all telephone functions remaining fully available. 

Simultaneous use of the mobile phone in the snap-in adapter and the USB port in the 
center console is possible. However, the audio files on the mobile phone cannot be 
accessed while a device is connected to the USB port.

System Components 


Components and Installation Locations 

The following control units act as the interface between the mobile phone 
and the vehicle: 

• ULF-SBX-High Interface box (Only for USB/Audio Interface) 

• Telematics Control Unit (TCU) 

The preconditions under which TCU or TCU and interface box together 
are installed are listed below:

23 

F01 Telephone System 














ULF-SBX-H Interface Box 

The ULF-SBX High interface box has been used in BMW vehicles since the introduction 
of E93. 

The (SBX High) interface box is capable of performing the following tasks: 

• USB connection for USB/audio interface 

• Bluetooth interface with hands-free mode and phone book 

• Basic voice input and activation system through the telephone 

Interface box and interface box ‘High’ support various techniques for downloading phone 
book entries from Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones. One of these techniques is 
Phonebook Access Profile (PBAP). The number of compatible mobile phones increases 
with the support of several downloading techniques. In addition, it is possible to download 
all the phone numbers attached to a name entry. 

Although both the ULF-SBX-H and the TCU may be fitted in a vehicle at the same time, 
the TCU always provides the telephone functions. In this case the telephone functions 
are not available in the ULF-SBX High and the module is only installed to provide the 
"USB audio interface" option.

F01/ F02, several antennas are installed in the vehicle, with the configuration depending 
on equipment trim level. 

The following antennas are used for this purpose: 

• Roof antenna 

• Bluetooth antenna
