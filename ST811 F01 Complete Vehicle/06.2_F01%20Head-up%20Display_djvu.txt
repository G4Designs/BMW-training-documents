Introduction 


The very name “Head-Up” describes the principle benefit of this system. The Head-up 
Display (HUD) projects a virtual image into the driver’s field of vision. Important informa¬ 
tion such as cruise control details or graphical directions from the navigation system are 
projected onto the windshield and are thus permanently visible within the driver’s field of 
view. 

The driver of a BMW thus has the important data and graphics put up in his field of view, 
just like a pilot in his jet fighter. 

The head-up display in the new BMW 7 Series incorporates various functions aimed at 
enhancing road safety and driver convenience. 

That includes display of: 

• Information from the DCC cruise control system 

• Information from the navigation system 

• Check Control messages 

• Road speed 

Having the displays in the driver’s direct field of view increases safety, as the eyes are 
always on the traffic.

System Functions 


The Principle 

The HUD can be compared to a projection device. A light source is required to project 
the HUD information. The two LED arrays (red and green) serve as the light source. The 
image content is created by the TFT projection display. The TFT projection display can 
be compared to a filter which admits or blocks light. 

An optical imaging element determines the shape, distance and size of the HUD 
images. 

The image appears to float freely over the road, the windshield acts as a deflecting mir¬ 
ror.

Switch-on Conditions 

The following conditions are required to release the light: 

• Terminal 15 ON 

• Button (HUD) pressed on the driver assistance system control panel, BEFAS. 


Switch-on Performance 

The HUD receives the terminal 30 ON status via the K-CAN. The HUD is partially ready 
for operation from terminal R ON. That means that: 

• The HUD can communicate with the other electrical-system devices via the K-CAN 

• The TFT projection display is initialized and blanked 

• The LEDs are off. 

The HUD receives the terminal 15 ON status via the K-CAN. The HUD is ready for opera¬ 
tion from terminal 15 ON. This permits the following actions: 

• Switching on of the backlighting by the button on the BAFAS 

• HUD height adjustment 

• Adjustment of HUD brightness 

• Display of information via the HUD. 

When the vehicle is started, the vehicle is set to terminal 50 status. In terminal 50, i.e. 
Lights Off, the HUD goes into a hold status. This hold status is maintained until shortly 
after the end of the terminal 50 status.

F01 Head-up Display 


Switch-off Conditions 

The HUD is switched off under the following conditions: 

• Button on the BAFAS pressed 

• Terminal R OFF 


Brightness Offset 

Brightness offset is a PIA Personal Profile function. Brightness offset allows the customer 
to set and save his/her own individual HUD default brightness setting. Each time the HUD 
is switched on, this setting is used as the brightness offset for the HUD. 

The brightness setting is adjusted with the controller via the CID. Any value between -10 
and +10 can be set. The mid-position value is 0. 

The value is transferred via the K-CAN to the HUD.

Brightness setting 


The brightness setting is automatically corrected in order to compensate for different 
light conditions. Compensation is based on signals from the rain and light sensor. 

The automatic brightness setting is configured in such a way that no HUD brightness 
jumps occur. 


11 

F01 Head-up Display 



The differing light conditions depend, for instance, on: 

• Environmental conditions, such as day, night, sunshine, clouds, rain, fog, snow, etc. 

• Surrounding structural features, such as tunnels, underground car parks, etc. 

• The driver can adjust the brightness of the instrument lighting with the knurled 
wheel. 

• From terminal 58g lights on, the HUD brightness is determined by the brightness 
setting of the instrument lighting. 

The brightness is dependent on the following conditions: 

• Dimmer-wheel setting 

• Brightness offset 

• Rain/light sensor, RLS 

Operating-hours Counter 

The HUD incorporates individual service-time counters for the HUD and the LED arrays. 

Display Area of Head-up Display 

The HUD size is approximately 200 mm x 100 mm with a display resolution of 480 x 240 
pixels. The HUD is separated into 2 display areas. The individual fields are “optically” sep¬ 
arated in the image so that they can be identified more easily.

Color Selection 

Symbols (such as e.g. warning symbols) are specified by the individual control units. The 
color specifications are adopted by the instrument cluster for display and representation 
on the HUD. 

“Flat” 2D symbols are used for optimum visibility and readability. 


The colors are: 

• Orange as the standard color 

• Red or yellow for warning messages 

• Green for the set speed 

• The HUD background is transparent

15 

F01 Head-up Display 



Cover Glass 

The cover glass is made from scratch-resistant, coated polycarbonate (PC) and forms the 
top cover of the HUD. The cover glass protects the interior of the HUD against dust and 
objects accidentally placed on it. 

The glass combined with the HUD trim are curved so that any incident light is not reflect¬ 
ed back to the driver. 

It also guarantees unobstructed projection of the display information onto the windshield 
without interference from stray light effects, for instance. 

Plane mirror 



Mirrors 


Two mirrors are fitted in the head-up display. They reflect the information in the display 
onto the windshield. 

The concave mirror (1) is responsible for compensating for the curvature of the wind¬ 
shield and for the size and distance of the image. 

The flat mirror (2) is a deflecting mirror to keep the beam in the space provided. 

The convex mirror is made of plastic while D 

the flat mirror is made of glass.

LED Array 

There are two LED arrays. The LED array is an arrangement of LEDs in one plane and 
acts as the back lighting for the TFT projection display. The LED array generates the light 
reguired for the HUD brightness. The LED arrays consist of red and green LEDs. The 
LEDs generate the brightness of the HUD content as controlled by the master PCB. 


PCB 

The following components among others are 
incorporated on the PCB: 

• K-CAN interface 

• Processor (CPU) 

• LVDS controller 

• EEPROM memory 

• Power supply 

The video signals are passed on to the display 
by the instrument cluster via an LVDS lead. 



Housing 

The casing is made of aluminum and consists of a bottom section and the plastic cover. 
The (aluminum) cooling fins and the electrical power supply are attached to the bottom 
section. The cover glass is integrated into the cover.

Windshield 


The windshield is a “special design” that is essential for projection of the displays. The 
outer and inner glass panes are bonded to a plastic film, just like in the standard wind¬ 
shield. Unlike in the standard windshield, this plastic film is not parallel but is tapered over 
the entire area of the windshield. 

The taper prevents the HUD from displaying images twice. The taper tip points down¬ 
wards and starts at a distance of approximately 10 cm to the bottom edge of the wind¬ 
shield. 

The end of the taper is located at approximately 2/3 windshield height. In the top third of 
the windshield, the plastic film runs parallel to the outer and inner glass panes. The thick¬ 
ness of the taper tip is 0.8 mm. The thickness of the end of the taper is 1 mm. 

The total thickness of the bottom edge of the windshield is 4.5 mm. The total thickness 
of the top edge of the windshield is 4.7 mm.

Incorrect Windshield Fitted 

The HUD image is always reflected on the These two images are overlaid by the angle of 
inner surface and outer surface of the taper in the HUD screen, so that the driver wind¬ 
shield only sees “one” image.

The rain and light sensor provides the brightness signal over the LIN bus to the roof func¬ 
tion Center FZD and then to the K-CAN. 

Eyebox 

The eyebox is the movement space in which the driver can move without his view of the 
image in the HUD being impaired. 

The freedom of movement within the eyebox is roughly: 

• 70 mm vertically plus ± 30 mm range of adjustment 

• 130 mm horizontally. 

The HUD image is not clearly visible outside the eyebox limits.

Instrument Cluster 

For the purposes of filtering the speed reading, a distinction is made between accelera¬ 
tion, braking and coasting phases. 

When the car is in the coasting phase, 3 successive values are averaged and then the 
speed is updated. 

Check Control Messages 

All CC messages are also displayed on the HUD. The instrument cluster has the master 
function for the messages. The symbol together with the associated text is transmitted by 
the instrument cluster. CC messages are given precedence over the display of other 
information such as navigation-system directions, for instance. 

Note: A Check Control message is displayed for 8 seconds. If several CC 

messages occur simultaneously, each one is displayed for 3 seconds. 


21 

F01 Head-up Display 








Controls 

The following controls are used in the operation of the HUD: 

• ON/OFF button on the BEFAS 

• Dimmer wheel in the light switch cluster 

• Controller. 

Driver Assistance System Control Panel 

The HUD On/Off button is located on the 
BEFAS. The button is resistance-coded and 
routed directly to the HUD. The HUD can 
identify the button signals or a button fault 
using the resistance coding. 


Instrument-lighting Dimming 

The dimmer setting is also used for the HUD 
with active headlights. The dimmer signal is 
emitted by the light module. 


Controller 

The HUD brightness and height settings are adjusted with the Controller via the CID. 
Brightness setting is also termed brightness offset. 

Functions such as e.g. navigation can also be set with the Controller in the Function 
selection menu. Therefore these settings have an indirect effect on the HUD display.

Adjusting the Height of the Horizon on the HUD 

On the BMW 7 Series F01/F02, the driver can adjust the location of the image and the 
eyebox to suit his/her particular requirements using the Drive controller. 

The eyebox can be shifted up to a maximum of ± 30 mm upwards or downwards. 

The height setting is adjusted as follows: 

• Call up the main menu by pressing the menu button. 

• Press the Controller and select the menu option “Settings”. 

• Turn the Controller until “Plead-up display” is selected and then press the Controller 
to confirm selection. 

• Turn the Controller until “FHeight setting” is selected and then press to confirm. 

• Set the desired height by turning the Controller and confirm by pressing. 



Note: The height can only be adjusted when the HUD is active. 

The height adjustment is in the scope of the PIA. The setting is stored in the EEPROM 
for each key. If the signal “Radio remote key status” is received when Terminal 30 is on, 
the mirror moves to the position set for the current key. 

The mirror remains in that position as long as the FIUD is switched on. 

Vertical Rotation of the HUD 

The HUD is supplied as standard with a defined basic setting. The HUD image can be 
rotated in the horizontal by a service technician using vertical rotation, after a change of 
windshield, for instance. 

The display is adjustable within a range of -3° to +3° by means of a motor. 

Detailed information may be found in the BMW diagnostic system.

Correcting Distortion (Warping) 

Should the image be distorted after a change of windshield, the image display can be 
improved using the Warping function. Warping is the technical term for the improvement 
of the image display. 

Detailed information on the subject of warping can be found in the BMW diagnostic 
system. 

Diagnosis 

The most important functions for service can be called up in diagnosis. 

These functions are: 

• Initiate self-test 

• Read out fault memory
