Introduction 


Comprehensive Exterior Lighting Systems 

The following information outlines the function of the exterior lighting system and the 
adaptive headlights. The F01/F02 are eguipped with standard adaptive headlights. 

The F01/F02 features the welcome light, making the vehicle even more customer 
friendly. The exterior lighting system is switched on for approximately 20 seconds when 
the vehicle is unlocked. This has the advantage of locating the vehicle more easily under 
unfavorable light conditions. 

A further feature is the daytime driving light that can be activated or deactivated via the 
Personal Profile.

Exterior Lighting System with Adaptive Headlights 

The adaptive headlights include the functions of the exterior lighting system. However it 
allows panning of the bi-xenon low-beam and high-beam headlights when cornering. 

Note: Standard equipment for the vehicle includes bi-xenon headlights, fog 
lights and automatic driving lights function. 

Panning of the bi-xenon low-beam and high-beam headlights is adapted continuously 
during cornering. Illumination during cornering therefore improves the driver’s vision. 

Illumination during cornering results in: 

• Safer cornering with faster identification of obstacles 

• Better perception of the environment 

• Prevention of accidents. 

The electronics of the adaptive headlight allow fast reaction to the current driving condi¬ 
tions. The system is controlled by the electronics and is less susceptible to malfunctions 
than purely mechanical systems. 

Furthermore an emergency program can be activated via the electronics.

Functions 

Overview 

The functions of the exterior lighting are integrated in the footwell module. 

These lighting functions are: 

• Side lights 

• Low beam headlight 

• High-beam headlight 

- Headlight flasher 

• Fog light 

• Direction indicator light 

- Hazard warning light 

• Tail light/license plate light 

• Dynamic brake light 

• Reversing light 

• Parking lights 

• Welcome light 

• Delayed switch-off home lights 

• Daytime driving light. 

The headlight lighting functions are powered via a headlight driver module or the 
footwell module. 

The footwell module controls a constant brightness level for each headlight. This is 
achieved with a pulse-width regulated voltage supply. Voltage fluctuations in the vehicle 
electrical and bus systems are compensated for by the pulse width. 

The headlight driver module receives the information on the voltage supply for its light 
source via the LIN bus. 

Note: The LEDs, e.g. in the additional brake light, tail light or bi-xenon head¬ 
light are not controlled but rather activated at 100 % pulse width. 


14 

F01 Exterior Lighting 





In addition to the standard light functions, further functions for the exterior lighting are 
integrated in the footwell module: 

• Dynamic beam throw adjustment system 

• Lamp monitoring 

- Cold monitoring with lights “OFF” 

- Hot monitoring with lights “ON” 

• Visual alarm/feedback 

- Central locking system 

- Antitheft alarm system 

- Crash signal 

• Special case at “Terminal 15 OFF” 

• Emergency operating mode 

• Adaptive headlight with 

- Turning lights 

- Adaptive headlight-range adjustment system.

F01 Exterior Lighting 



















Side Light 

The light switch in the light control unit must be turned to switch position 1 to switch on 
the side light. 

The following lamps are activated together with switching on the side light: 

• Daytime driving light corona rings, dimmed on bi-xenon headlights 

• Tail lights 

• Left/right license plate light 

• Terminal 58 switched. 

Low Beam Headlight 

To switch on the low beam headlights, the light switch in the lights control panel must be 
turned to low beam headlight (switch position 2) When the low beam headlights are 
switched-on the bi-xenon headlights are activated. 

After turning off the engine, the side lights stay on although the light switch is in switch 
position 2. The side lights are switched off automatically as the driver’s door is opened. 

Note: The light switch must be consciously set to switch 
position 1 in order to make the vehicle more easily 
detectable by means of the side lights when it is dark. 

An audible signal (gong) sounds and the check control 
message opposite is shown in the instrument cluster 
as soon as the side lights are switched on. Leaving the 
side lights switched on can drain the vehicle battery. 

High-beam Headlight 

The high beam headlight is switched on under following conditions: 

• Terminal 15 ON and 

• Light switch in position 2 low beam and 

• Turn-signal/high-beam switch for high-beam headlight ON. 

The headlight flasher is activated by pulling on the turn-signal/high-beam switch. 

The function is operative as from Terminal 30F ON. 

Direction Indicator/high Beam Switch 

The steering column switch cluster contains the direction indicator/high beam switch. 
The signal from the turn-signal/high-beam switch is transmitted from the steering column 
switch cluster via the FlexRay. The central gateway module transfers the signal to the K- 
CAN2. The footwell module thus receives the signals from the turn-signal/high-beam 
switch. 




Automatic Driving Lights Control 

The following conditions must apply for the low-beam headlights to be switched on: 

• Light switch in position A automatic driving light control and 

• Status “Terminal 15 ON” and 

• Rain/driving lights/solar sensor or rain/light/ solar/condensation sensor signals dark¬ 
ness. 

Note: The rain/driving lights/solar sensor has now been extended with the 
condensation sensor function. It performs the condensation sensor 
function for the air conditioning system. 

Only the rain/light/solar/condensation sensor is used from now on in the 
description. The description also applies correspondingly for the 
rain/driving lights/ solar sensor. Both sensors are connected over the LIN 
bus. 

The footwell module switches on the low-beam light if the signal from the rain/light/solar/ 
condensation sensor fails due to a defect. 

The low beam lights are switched on together with the side lights by the automatic dri¬ 
ving lights control system as soon as the rain/light/ solar/condensation sensor detects a 
certain level of ambient brightness. The signal is sent from the 
rain/light/solar/condensation sensor via the LIN bus to the junction box electronics. 

The junction box electronics routes the signal via the K-CAN2 to the footwell module. In 
turn, the footwell module evaluates the signal and switches on the driving lights. 

The driving lights switched on by the automatic driving lights control system can be 
switched off with the light switch or by means of the rain/light/solar/condensation sensor. 

The side lights can also remain on after “Terminal 15 OFF” because they were switched 
on by the automatic driving lights control function. The side lights are switched off auto¬ 
matically after opening the driver’s door. 

If a different door is used to exit the vehicle, the side lights will be switched off when the 
vehicle is locked. 

The rain/light/solar/condensation sensor supplies the switch-on signal for the driving 
lights at a specific level of darkness. 

The roof functions center is responsible for the voltage supply to the rain/light/solar/ con¬ 
densation sensor. 

The junction box electronics gueries relevant statuses via the LIN bus and transmits them 
over the K-CAN2.

F01 Exterior Lighting 



Fog Lights 

Switching Fog Lights ON/OFF 

The fog lights can be switched on under the following conditions: 

• Terminal 15 ON and 

• Light switch in position 1 side lights or position 2 low-beam headlights 
ON or automatic driving lights control and 

• Fog lights button pressed. 

The fog lights are switched off by pressing the button again. When switched on, the fog 
lights can also be switched off by turning the light switch to the “Lights OFF” position. 

The fog lights can be switched on again when the light switch is set to the side lights, 
low beam or automatic driving lights control position. 



A H-8 35 W bulb is fitted in each fog light. 

Direction Indicator Lights 

The front and rear direction indicator light as well as the side direction indicator repeaters 
can be switched on as from Terminal R ON. They are operated by means of the switch on 
the steering column switch cluster. The signal from the steering column stalk is transmit¬ 
ted redundantly via the FlexRay and a separate wire. This increases system availability, for 
instance in the event of faults. 

It is nonetheless still possible to use the direction indicators if the information does not 
arrive at the footwell module via the bus system. This is because the information is avail¬ 
able redundantly over the separate wire. 


19 

F01 Exterior Lighting 


Note: The redundant transmission is also used for the one-touch indicating 
and headlight flasher functions. 

A defective light source in the front or rear direction indicator lights causes the remaining 
direction indicator lights to flash at double the rate. A defective light source in the front 
direction indicator repeaters has no influence on the flashing rate of the direction indicator 
lights. 

All direction indicator lights are equipped with LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes). 

One-touch Indicating 

The direction indicator lights are activated once in connection with one-touch indicating. 

In the personal profile it is possible to set the one-touch indicating function from flashing 
once to three times. 

Hazard Warning Lights 

The hazard warning lights are switched on by pressing the hazard warning switch. As a 
result, all direction indicator lights are activated simultaneously and the indicator in the 
hazard warning switch flashes in time. 

The steering column switch has priority if it is moved in left or right direction while the 
hazard warning lights are active. The hazard warning function resumes after “Terminal 15 
OFF” or cancelling the direction indicator. 

The hazard warning lights have priority when the direction indicator lights for turning left 
or right are switched on and the hazard warning light switch is pressed.

on for a shorter time and off for a longer time. 


20 

F01 Exterior Lighting 






Hazard warning lights in connection with alarm triggered 
by the anti-theft alarm system 

The footwell module receives the request for the hazard warning lights via the K-CAN2. 
The signal is sent by the ultrasonic interior movement detector. 

The alarm time for the hazard warning lights is 6 minutes provided the antitheft alarm 
system is not switched off. The hazard warning light switch is blanked out during the 
alarm and therefore does not flash together with the lights. 

Note: The ultrasonic interior movement detector is completely integrated in 
the roof functions center, both in terms of hardware and software. 

Visual and Audible Indicators 

The instrument cluster provides visual and audible indication of the turn signals. The 
footwell module informs the instrument cluster via the K-CAN2 to activate the acoustic 
generator and the indicator lights together with the direction indicator lights. 

The visual/audible indicator in the instrument cluster switches off if the vehicle is locked 
with the central locking while the hazard warning light function is active. 

Visual Feedback Through the Central Locking 

The visual feedback is set at the factory. The direction indicator lights flash when the cen¬ 
tral locking is activated. The Car Access System makes available the signal necessary for 
this purpose via the K-CAN2. 

The visual feedback can be deactivated in the personal profile. 

The antitheft alarm system can also initiate visual feedback for the customer. 


21 

F01 Exterior Lighting 



Tail Light / License Plate Light 

In the same way as the side lights, the tail light can be switched on from Terminal 30F 
ON together with the license plate light by using the light switch (position 1). 

Rear Light Cluster 

The rear light cluster of the F01/F02 is based on a split design. One part is integrated in 
the body and the other in the luggage compartment lid. The two parts form the complete 
rear light cluster. 

The rear light cluster in the body section is fitted with LEDs for the following lighting func¬ 
tions. 

• Tail lights 

• Brake light 

• Direction indicator lights 

• Side marker light, integrated in the tail light. 

Three lighting functions are integrated in the rear light cluster. They are: 

• Reversing lights 16 W 

• Brake light (US version “Brake Force Display” - BFD) 

• Tail lights based on LEDs. 

At Terminal 30 the consumption of the tail lights is reduced by only switching on the tail 
light in the rear side panel.

Brake Light 

As from “Terminal R ON”, the brake lights can be switched on by activating the brake 
light switch. 

The Car Access System powers the brake light switch with 5 V voltage. The footwell 
module evaluates the status of the brake pedal switch and actuates the brake light. The 
brake light switch provides two levels. 

The signal of the brake pedal switch is also used for the beam throw adjustment (LWR). 

Note: The brake light can also be activated by a braking assistant function 
such as ACC. 

Adaptive Brake Light - US 

The current adaptive brake light remains in the national-market version US. Braking is 
indicated by an increase in size and luminous intensity. It is not permissible for the red 
surfaces of the brake light to flash. The adaptive brake light is part of the standard equip¬ 
ment. 

The following conditions must be met for operation of the adaptive brake light: 

• Driving speed > 5 kph (3 mph) 

• Brake deceleration above 5 m/s2 or 

• Control intervention by the antilock braking system. 


23 

F01 Exterior Lighting 












Reversing Light 

The reversing light can be switched on as from “Terminal 15 ON”. The footwell module 
receives the signal via the K-CAN2. The electronic transmission control unit makes avail¬ 
able this signal. 

When the vehicle is in trailer towing mode, the reversing light of the trailer is additionally 
activated via the trailer module. 

Parking Lights 

The parking lights are switched on with the steering column switch as from “Terminal 
30” and detected by the footwell module via the KCAN2. 

For the parking light function, the footwell module activates the front side lights and the 
tail light in the outer chamber of the rear light cluster. 

The steering column stalk for the parking lights must be pressed for longer than half a 
second. This prevents the parking lights being switched on by mistake, e.g. by knocking 
against the steering column switch while getting out of the car.

More Functions 


Bi-xenon Headlights 

Bi-xenon headlights are installed as standard equipment and are located in the outer 
chamber of the headlights. 

In connection with the bi-xenon headlights, the shutter for the low beam light is activated 
by the “high beam ON” signal thus enabling the high beam light. High beam is also used 
for the headlight flasher function

Daytime driving lights 

A 35 W bulb for the daytime driving light is in the headlight inner chamber. The daytime 
driving light with respect to the side lights is produced by the inner and outer corona 
rings. The corona rings are fiber optics conductors. 

The inner corona ring is illuminated from behind. The reflector is designed to ensure that 
the light mainly illuminates the corona ring. Light from the same headlight chamber is 
coupled in two fiber optics cables and fed to the outer corona ring. 

The footwell module decreases the daytime driving lights as soon as the side lights or 
low beam lights are switched on. Consequently, both corona rings of the daytime driving 
light are now used for the side lights. 

The light switch must be in position “0” in order to activate the daytime driving lights. 

The daytime driving lights are also switched on at low beam OFF with automatic driving 
lights control. The light switch must be set to position “A”. 

The daytime driving lights function is country-specific and is activated as from “Terminal 
15 ON”. The daytime driving lights can be deactivated/activated via the personal profile. 

The daytime driving lights are switched off after “Terminal 15 OFF”. 

Note: The daytime driving lights cannot be deactivated in the personal profile 
in the US version. The daytime driving lights can also be activated in 
light switch position 1 side lights. 

26 

F01 Exterior Lighting 


















Welcome Light 

The welcome light can not be activated when the light switch is in position “0” or “1 
Furthermore, the side lights are also not to be activated. 

The welcome light is switched on as soon as the vehicle is unlocked. For this purpose, 
the Car Access System makes available the status of the central locking system via the 
K-CAN2. 

The footwell module receives the “Unlock vehicle” status and switches on the exterior 
lighting for approximately 20 seconds. 

While switched on, the welcome light can be deactivated with the “Terminal 15 ON” sta¬ 
tus. 

The following light units are activated: 

• Tail lights 

• Corona rings 

• Side marker light 

• Interior lighting 

• Courtesy lighting 

• Indicator light in the instrument cluster. 

Delayed Switch-off Home Lights 

The delayed switch-off home lights are standard equipment. The lights can be switched 
on via the steering column switch for high beam as from lights OFF, at Terminal 30. 

The switch-on time is set at the factory to 40 seconds and can be set between 0 and 
240 seconds in the “Personal Profile”. 

The low beam, side lights and tail lights are switched on when the home lights function is 
active. 

Beam Throw Adjustment System 

The F01/F02 has a dynamic beam throw adjustment system in the standard equipment. 
The dynamic beam throw adjustment system is a legal requirement for bi-xenon light. 

The dynamic beam throw adjustment ensures that oncoming traffic is not dazzled. 

One ride-height sensor is installed at the front and one at the rear for the beam throw 
adjustment system. 


27 

F01 Exterior Lighting 



Front and rear ride-height sensors 

One ride-height sensor is mounted on the front axle and the other ride-height sensor on 
the rear axle of the vehicle. The signals from the ride-height sensors are used for the 
beam throw adjustment LWR. 

The ride-height sensors are evaluated directly by the integrated chassis management. 
The footwell module receives the signals from the integrated chassis management via 
the KCAN2. In the central gateway module the signal must be transferred from the 
FlexRay to the K-CAN. 

Lamp Monitoring 

The footwell monitors all lamps of the exterior lighting system both when switched on 
and when switched off. The monitoring function starts as from “Terminal 15 ON”. 

Cold monitoring with “Lights OFF” 

Cold monitoring is based on measuring the current of the individual lamp outputs. The 
current pulse used for measurement purposes is so short that the lamps are not illumi¬ 
nated. The footwell module evaluates the individual lamp outputs to establish whether 
there is a line break or a lamp bulb is defective. 

The number of current pulses is increased significantly during the first 4 seconds after 
“Terminal 15 ON”. To check whether the lamps are in working order before setting off. 
This function is referred to as the pre-drive check. 

The number of pulses is then reduced after the pre-drive check. Power is then applied to 
the lamps every 1.5 minutes. 

The lights fitted with LEDs are not included in the cold monitoring system. The LEDs 
react too fast to the current pulse and would consequently light up. 

The bi-xenon headlight is also not included in the cold monitoring. 

Hot monitoring with “Lights ON” 

Hot monitoring is based on measuring the current of the individual lamp outputs. The 
lamp current is used to detect an overcurrent or interruption (break). The front and rear 
direction indicator lights are also included in the lamp monitoring system.

Visual Alarm/feedback 


Central locking system 

The Car Access System outputs signals for the central locking system function. The 
footwell module also receives the signals via the K-CAN2 and uses them for visual feed¬ 
back of the central locking system. 

Antitheft alarm system 

The footwell module enables the antitheft alarm system to trigger the visual alarm via the 
direction indicator lights. 

The roof functions center with integrated ultrasonic interior movement detector makes 
available the signal for the visual alarm via the K-CAN2. Furthermore, the footwell module 
receives the signals from the roof functions center for visual feedback of the antitheft 
alarm system. 

Crash signal 

The footwell module switches on the hazard warning lights and the interior lighting when 
the crash safety module sends a crash signal. The hazard warning lights can be switched 
off with the hazard warning light switch. 

The light in the hazard warning light switch is switched off by pressing the light switch to 
position 0 “Lights OFF” or by means of the rocker switch on the steering column stalk. 

Special Case at “Terminal 15 OFF” 

The exterior lighting would be switched off if “Terminal 15 ON” fails during vehicle opera¬ 
tion or Terminal 15 is inadvertently deactivated by pressing the START-STOP button. 

The driving lights remain switched-on in order to maintain road safety in this situation. 
When the driving speed drops below 20 kph (12 mph), the low beam light is also 
switched off after a delay of approximately 30 seconds. 

Emergency Operating Mode 

Emergency operating mode is assumed if a defect occurs in the software of the footwell 
module that could cause failure of the entire exterior lighting system. In this case, the tail 
lights and the additional brake light are activated. This function is active as from “Terminal 
15 ON”. 

Driving lights: Low beam headlight and one tail light on each side 
Brake lights: Additional brake light and one tail light on each side

Adaptive Headlight 

Adaptive headlight are an option and include the following functions: 

• Adaptive headlight 

• Turning lights 

• Variable headlight beam pattern 

• Adaptive headlight-range adjustment system. 

The adaptive headlight were introduced with the E60. The F01/F02 therefore also 
includes, for instance, the functions variable headlight beam pattern or turning lights. 

Furthermore, the adaptive headlight-range adjustment system is an additional function. 

The light switch must be in the automatic driving lights control position. 

Legal Regulation 

Panning of headlights for the adaptive headlights is permitted within certain limits. An 
important point is that oncoming traffic is not to be dazzled by the headlights. 

When the driver turns the steering wheel the vehicle moves on a circular track. The circu¬ 
lar track is defined by movement of the wheels and the angle setting of the front wheels. 

In order to avoid dazzling oncoming traffic, the break point of the headlight cut-off line 
must not lie on the left of the circular track within the distance of 100 times the headlight 
installation height. 

The statement for the cut-off line refers to driving on the right. For driving on the left the 
statement for the cut-off line is mirror-symmetrical.

Preconditions for the Adaptive Headlight 

To ensure its operability, the adaptive headlight must be adapted to the vehicle-specific 
data. The vehicle-specific data are located in the footwell module and in the headlight dri¬ 
ver modules. 

The footwell module contains the data: 

• Vehicle identification number 

• Vehicle type. 

The headlight driver modules contain the data for: 

• Headlight and headlight swivel range 

• Permitted acceleration and deceleration ramps 

• Characteristic speed maps 

• Encoding 

• Vehicle identification number 

• Vehicle type. 

The footwell module has the central responsibility for the adaptive headlight function. 

The entire software for the adaptive headlight is therefore located in the footwell module. 

The footwell module is connected via the LIN bus for communication with the headlight 
driver modules. 

The footwell module requests the current headlight status. The footwell module sends 
the requests necessary for panning the light from the headlights to the headlight driver 
modules via the LIN bus. 

The footwell module is also still connected to the vehicle electrical and bus systems via 
the K-CAN2. Signals important for the function of the adaptive headlights are received by 
the footwell module via the K-CAN2. 

The table below lists those control units that provide input signals.

Bi-xenon Headlight 

Each bi-xenon headlight contains following components: 

• Bi-xenon control unit 

• Swivel module for bi-xenon headlight 

• Stepper motor for headlight vertical aim control 

• Side light corona/daytime driving light corona 

• Direction indicator lights 

• Design light 

• Side marker light 

• Headlight driver module. 

Bi-xenon Control Uunit 

The bi-xenon control unit is located on the bi-xenon headlights. 

It supplies the power and ignition voltage for the bi-xenon light bulb. 

Swivel module for bi-xenon headlight 

Among other things, the swivel module contains following components: 

• Bi-xenon lamp 

• Hall sensor for zero position 

• Stepper motor. 

The bi-xenon light bulb is integrated in the swivel section of the adaptive headlight. 
The zero position Hall sensor registers the zero position of the swivel module. 

The stepper motor provides the swivel movement of the swivel module. A separate 
stepper motor is installed for the headlight vertical aim control. 

The headlight driver module controls and monitors the movement of the stepper 
motors for the adaptive headlights and the vertical aim control system. 

Side lights/daytime driving light 

The side lights/daytime driving light is designed as a fiber optics light guide ring. 

A 35 W bulb (H8) supplies the light to the fiber optics ring from below. 


32 

F01 Exterior Lighting 




Switch-on Conditions 

The adaptive headlight can be activated as from terminal status “Terminal 15 ON”. 

The rain/light/solar/condensation sensor sends the request to switch on the low beam 
headlights as soon as it detects low light levels (darkness). Initially, the footwell module 
switches on the headlight driver modules. The adaptive headlight is ready for operation 
following a reference run of the bi-xenon headlights. 

Note: A reference run is performed during every new start. 

The conditions for switching on the adaptive headlight are: 

• “Terminal 15 ON” 

• Light switch in automatic driving light control position 

• Rain/light/solar/condensation sensor detects darkness 

• Both bi-xenon headlights are intact. 

Note: The footwell module detects a defective bi-xenon headlight by measur¬ 
ing the intake current of the respective bi-xenon headlight. 

Switching on Adaptive Headlight 

The adaptive headlight is switched on as soon as the rain/light/solar/condensation sensor 
sends the switch-on signal for the low-beam headlight. 

Function Indicator 

The low beam headlight and the headlight vertical aim control remain active in the case 
of fault. The swivel function of the bi-xenon modules is deactivated. A Check Control 
message is output on the instrument cluster. 

Reference Run 

In order to determine the zero position, the adaptive headlight performs a reference run 
depending on the current position of the swivel module. 

To avoid a hysteresis during calibration, the swivel module always moves from the same 
side over the zero position sensor. 

This is achieved in that the swivel module is always moved to the same side of the zero 
position sensor before switching off the adaptive headlight. 

Zero Position Sensor 

The zero position of the swivel module with respect to the zero position sensor is detect¬ 
ed by a 1/0 edge when swivelling from the direction of the off position in the direction of 
the optical axis. The swivel module is repeatedly calibrated during operation based on this 
“soft” reference point.

Driving the stepper motor in positive direction of the swivel module corresponds to swivel 
movement to the right. 


Mechanical Stop 

Items 1 and 7 represent the mechanical stops of the swivel module. The mechanical 
stops are defined by the design of the headlights. 

Differential Angle 

A differential angle is reguired when the position of the swivel module is not known. A 
reference run that extends to the mechanical stops must be performed for this purpose. 
This is known as a “hard” reference run. 

Optical Axis 

The swivel position, in which the swivel module is in the straight-ahead direction of the 
vehicle is referred to as the optical axis. An angle of 0° is assigned to this position. 

The optical axis is defined exactly as an angle with respect to the zero position sensor 
and as an angle with respect to the mechanical stop. 

Consequently, the optical axis during swivel movement can be “normally” determined by 
way of the zero position sensor. 

The differential angle with respect to the mechanical reference point is used in the case 
of fault. 


34 

F01 Exterior Lighting 






















Swivel Range 

Normally, the swivel module does not move to the mechanical stop but rather to the elec¬ 
tric minimum and maximum stops. 

Adjustment of the swivel module to the electrical stops avoids the loss of pulses on 
reaching a mechanical stop. 

The minimum and maximum electrical stops are defined as angles with respect to the 
zero position. 

Note: The panning ranges define the maximum pan angles that the adaptive 
headlights can utilize. 

Panning, raising and lowering headlights 

Via the LIN bus the footwell module instructs the headlight driver modules to actuate the 
respective stepper motors. 

The headlight driver modules activate the stepper motors for panning. For the variable 
headlight beam pattern, the headlight driver modules also actuate the stepper motors to 
raise or lower the headlights. The maximum adaptive headlight panning range must not 
be exceeded when cornering. This must also be considered for the variable beam pattern 
headlights. 

The off-side headlight requires a certain outward pan angle combined with a certain 
amount of lowering according to the headlight beam pattern. 

The outward pan angle must be subtracted from the adaptive headlight pan angle for left- 
hand bends. 

The table below shows which headlights are moved to set the various headlight beam 
patterns. The first example illustrates the situation for movement when driving in a straight 
line.

Example for left-hand bend: 

When the urban beam pattern is active, the off-side headlight pans approximately 
12° outwards. At the same time, the headlight is slightly lowered. Since, a panning range 
of up to 15°is available for left-hand bends, only 3° more is left for corner illumination. 

Example for right-hand bend: 

When the urban beam pattern is active, the off-side headlight pans approximately 
12° outwards. At the same time, the headlight is slightly lowered. For a right-hand 
bend a panning range of 8°is available. The headlight pans the full 8°. 

Traverse Rate 

The traverse rate of the swivel modules is up to 30°/second. 

Swiveling 

The following signals are made available to the footwell module for the purpose of moving 
the swivel module. 

• Steering angle 

• Road speed 

• Yaw rate. 

Under normal driving conditions, the adaptive headlight is controlled by the data from the 
steering angle sensor up to a speed of approximately 40 kph (25mph).

The yaw rate sensor is included in the calculation 

• at speeds higher than approximately 40 km/h (25 mph) 

• in the event of vehicle oversteering or understeering 

• a vehicle tending to yaw. 

The wheel speed sensors supply the signals for the vehicle speed. The dynamic stability 
control evaluates the wheel speed sensor of each wheel. 

The vehicle oversteering/understeering or yawing is detected by means of the steering 
angle sensor and the yaw rate sensor. 

The adaptive headlight is deactivated in the event of the vehicle oversteering/ understeer¬ 
ing or yawing. The swivel module returns to its zero position. 

Note: The yaw rate sensor makes available signals relating to the yaw of the 
vehicle about the vertical axis. It is installed between the driver’s and 
front passenger seats on the transmission tunnel. 

The steering angle sensor is integrated in the steering column switch 
cluster. It is an optical sensor and makes available data relating to the 
steering wheel lock angle. 

Headlight Driver Module 

The headlight driver module controls and monitors the stepper motors for the adaptive 
headlights and the headlight beam throw adjustment system of the respective bi-xenon 
headlight. 

The integrated chassis management makes available the values for the dynamic head¬ 
light beam throw adjustment system to the footwell module. The footwell module 
receives these values via the K-CAN2. In this way the beam angle can be adapted to the 
different driving situations, e.g. laden/unladen. 

The signal from the integrated chassis management must be transferred to the KCAN2 in 
the central gateway module.

- Reference run 

- Target position commands 

- Diagnosis requests 

• Output control of the stepper motors 

• Zero position acquisition of swivel module 

• Reference run of swivel module 

• Position feedback of swivel module to footwell module 

• Diagnosis 

• Feedback of diagnosis data to the footwell module. 

The footwell module in its function as the central control unit for the adaptive headlight 
checks the status of the headlight driver modules every 20 ms. 

Furthermore, the footwell module initiates activation of the LEDs in the front headlights. 

Zero Position of Swivel Module 

The zero position of the swivel module is determined by the zero position sensor. The 
zero position sensor is a Hall sensor. The falling edge of the Hall sensor is evaluated to 
determine the zero position. The zero position corresponds to exactly the position of the 
swivel module in the straight-ahead position of the vehicle. 

The headlight driver modules prepare the data for data transfer via the LIN bus. 

The footwell module requests the data from the headlight driver modules. 

Note: The sensor signal can be read out during diagnosis. 

The sensor is defective if no sensor signal is applied. 

Switch-off Conditions 

As from “Terminal 15 OFF”, the footwell module sends the request via the LIN bus to 
assume the rest position of both swivel modules to the headlight driver modules. On 
reaching the rest position of the swivel modules, the headlight driver modules send a 
confirmation to the footwell module. The headlight driver modules also activate the side 
lights function.

Turning lights at speeds up to 70 kph (43 mph) 

In very tight corners with a radius of less than 100 m, the turning light function can now 
be activated for even better illumination at speeds up to 70 kph (43 mph). This is particu¬ 
larly helpful on switchback roads. The function is activated if the steering wheel is turned 
to an appropriate angle. 

Note: The turning light function can be activated below 40 kph (25 mph) by 
switching on the turn-signal indicator or turning the steering wheel by 
an appropriate amount. 

Input parameters: 

• Headlights switched on by automatic headlights function 

• Steering angle 

• Road speed 

• Light switch in automatic driving light control position. 

Adaptive Headlight-range Adjustment System 

The adaptive headlight-range adjustment system is designed for driving through dips and 
over crests. 

When driving through a dip the headlight beam throw is increased. The headlights are 
moved up a small amount. The driver can see further and oncoming vehicles are not daz¬ 
zled. Obstacles on the roadway can therefore be detected earlier than with earlier head¬ 
light systems. This allows an early reaction to obstacles and initiation of any evasive 
action that may be reguired. 

BMW makes an active contribution to safer driving with the adaptive headlight-range 
adjustment system. 

Driving through a dip 



42 

F01 Exterior Lighting 






When driving over a crest the beam pattern produced by the headlights is slightly low¬

The cumulative negative change to the

lights are lowered for driving over the crest. 
If the headlights were to remain in this posi¬ 
tion the light would illuminate the “ground” 
after a crest. In order to avoid this situation 
occurring, the footwell module switches the 
headlights back to the normal beam angle 
before the end of the crest.

Functional Principle 

The adaptive headlight-range adjustment system only becomes active when the light 
switch is in position “A” and the driving lights have been switched on by the 
rain/light/solar/ condensation sensor. 

Raising or lowering of the headlight beam pattern is based to a great extent upon the cal¬ 
culation of two signals. The signals are the driving speed as well as the longitudinal accel¬ 
eration of the vehicle. These signals are used to calculate the incline and respectively the 
downhill gradient compared with the horizon. The footwell module continuously imports 
the signals via the K-CAN2 and uses them to calculate the current values for the adaptive 
headlight-range adjustment system. The values correspond to the incline angles over the 
time period. The incline angles may be positive, negative or zero. The difference between 
the individual incline angles is used by the footwell module to calculate whether it is nec¬ 
essary to adjust the headlights. 


45 

F01 Exterior Lighting 




















































The signal from the ride-height sensors is incorporated into the calculation. This allows 
the pitch angle of the vehicle body, due to a vehicle load for instance, to be included in 
the calculation. 

Data from the longitudinal acceleration sensor and the ride-height sensors are output 
through the integrated chassis management via the FlexRay. Data for the driving speed 
are provided by the integrated chassis management also via the FlexRay. The central 
gateway module transfers the data from the FlexRay to the K-CAN2. The footwell module 
receives the data via the K-CAN2. 

Note: The integrated chassis management contains the sensors for the longi¬ 
tudinal and lateral acceleration of the vehicle as well as the yaw rate sensor. 

Signals from the wheel speed sensors are registered by the Dynamic 
Stability Control for the driving speed signal. The Dynamic Stability 
Control outputs the data to the FlexRay. The integrated chassis manage¬ 
ment generates the driving speed signal from the data and makes the 
signal available to the vehicle electrical and bus systems. 1

Short-term function deactivation 

In unfavorable, situations the light emitted by the headlights may be set incorrectly by the 
adaptive headlight-range adjustment system. One consequence of this could be dazzling 
of oncoming traffic. Therefore the footwell module interrupts the function for a short time 
to protect other road users. 

The following conditions interrupt the function for a short time: 

• Signal from the Dynamic Stability Control 

- Control intervention by the antilock braking system 

- Control intervention by the Automatic Stability Control 

- Control intervention by the Dynamic Stability Control 

• Signal from the longitudinal acceleration sensor in the integrated chassis manage¬ 
ment 

- Very high longitudinal acceleration 

• Signal from the footwell module from the dynamic beam throw adjustment system 

- Poor-route detection system signals uneven road.

Remote Light 

The Remote Light function is the Vehicle Finder visual signalling. The driving lights are 
switched on for the signalling. 


Switch-on conditions 

The Remote Light function can be requested via the telematics service provider. The 
request is only carried out if the battery has not yet reached the limit for starting. The 
vehicle must be stationary and the engine switched off. 

Switch-off conditions 

Remote Light can be switched off by the following conditions: 

• Battery has reached the limit for starting 

• Interior light button is pressed 

• Change in status of a Hall sensor in the door contacts 

• Renewed request Start of a new sequence for the Remote Light function 

• Remote Light time expired 

• Terminal status change, START-STOP button pressed.

Service Information 


Adjusting Headlights 

The same procedure as before can be adopted for adjusting the lights. On a vehicle with 
the adaptive headlights optional extra the light switch must be in position “2”. 

If the lights have been switched on by the automatic headlights function, the urban 
beam pattern will be active. The headlights can only be correctly adjusted when they are 
set to the single-carriageway beam pattern. 

Note: When the lights are set to the urban beam pattern, the off-side head¬ 
light turns slightly outwards and is simultaneously slightly lowered. If 
the lights are adjusted when set to this beam pattern, they will dazzle 
oncoming traffic when switched to the single-carriageway and highway 
beam patterns. 

Therefore, you should always set the lights switch to position “2”. 

When replacing headlights, make sure to use genuine BMW parts only. 

Note: It is essential to follow the repair instructions. 


49 

F01 Exterior Lighting 




Replacing Components 

Different repairs may be made during the life of the vehicle. The repairs may mean that 
components for the adaptive headlights have been installed with different software and 
hardware states. 

New parts and/or used parts are used with the components already installed in the 
vehicle. 

The replaced components must definitely be adapted to the vehicle. 

The components below are some of those that could have been replaced during 
servicing:

Footwell Module 

Follow the repair instructions when replacing the footwell module. Make sure that only 
genuine BMW spare parts are used. Only genuine BMW spare parts guarantee correct

Diagnosis 

Diagnostic Mode 

The exterior lighting system must be set to diagnostic mode for different diagnosis 
orders. These diagnosis orders may be: 

• Read out of the relevant bus signals when stationary 

- Road speed 

- Yaw rate 

- Steering angle 

• Check of signal plausibility 

• Check of switch-on conditions 

- Status of the rain/driving lights/solar sensor 

- Status of the rain/light/solar/condensation sensor 

- Status of the high-beam headlight assistant 

- Status of the light switch. 

Missing or non-plausible bus signals are saved in the footwell module as a fault. 
Fault types are saved in the headlight driver module. 

Access to the headlight driver module is achieved via the footwell module.
