F01 PDC-TRSVC 




Introduction 


With the F01/F02, the customer is able to choose from a comprehensive range of 
optional driver assistance systems. 

The individual systems and function units are becoming ever more densely networked 
as a result of the shared use of components, signals and displays in some areas. 

These are the optionally available combinations: 

• PDC 

• Rear-view Camera 

• Side View Camera 

Park Distance Control (PDC) is standard equipment on the F01/F02, with the ZCE 
Camera Package available as an option. The Camera Package includes the Rear-view 
Camera and the Side View Cameras. The TRSVC control unit is used to manage the 
different video feeds and display them on the CID in combination with PDC functions. 

TRSVC stands for Top Rear Side View Camera diver assistance system.

System Components 


Park Distance Control 

The Park Distance Control of the F01/F02 is identifiable by the five ultrasonic sensors 
on the front bumper. The fifth sensor enables a high level of reliability in obstacle recog¬ 
nition to be achieved despite the large front end of the F01.

has been integrated into the junction box 
electronics for the first time.

RearView Camera 


In the F01, the optional rear view camera requires the vehicle to have been equipped with 
the PDC option. The rearview camera is located to the right of the recessed handle on 
the luggage compartment lid.

Side View 

The F01/F02 is the first of BMW’s vehicles to feature the new Side View Camera. 


The function is realized by two digital cameras, 
one on the front right wheel housing and one 
on the front left wheel housing. They make it 
easier for the driver to pull into roads and 
junctions in which the driver’s view to the 
side is obstructed.

The driver can activate the Side View cameras 
using a button in the control panel next to the 
gear selector lever.

The camera images are shown in the CID in splitscreen view up to a road speed of 
30 km/h/19mph. 

Like the rearview camera, the two side view cameras send their video signals to the 
TRSVC control unit along LVDS data lines. 

The signals are forwarded along CVBS lines to the video switch VSW and CIC. The CIC 
sends image data to the CID along LVDS data lines. 

The CID is where the image data are displayed.

The audible and visual distance warnings (the results of distance measurements) given to 
the driver are provided by the audio loudspeakers and by displays in the CID respectively.

RearView Camera 

With the PDC and rearview camera eguipment combination, the controller and the oper¬ 
ating menu can be used to toggle between the basic PDC display and the rearview cam¬ 
era image with PDC.

To assist the driver, the rearview camera image contains turning-circle lines, lane/ park¬ 
ing-aid lines, obstacle markings and, where applicable, zoomed views of the trailer cou¬ 
pling.

Service Information 


Park Distance Control 

During the installation of license plates, license plate carriers and baseplates, care must 
be taken not to cover the center sensor in the front bumper. Obstructions caused by 
license plate carriers or even deposits of dirt, snow and ice on the carriers could impair 
the operation of the center sensor.
