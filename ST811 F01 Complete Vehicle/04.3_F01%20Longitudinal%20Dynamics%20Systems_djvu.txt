Introduction 


Refinements in Detail 

The longitudinal dynamics systems described in this document comprise the following: 

• Dynamic stability control (DSC) and 

• Electromechanical parking brake (EMF) 

Both DSC and EMF are standard eguipment on all F01/F02 models. Thus BMW has 
consistently continued the standards set by the E65/E66 and the E70/E71. Both sys¬ 
tems are based on the technology used on the E70/ E71. 

However, many specific details have had to be changed. Those changes were essential 
to ensure that DSC and EMF could be seamlessly integrated in the new dynamic 
handling system complex on the F01/F02. 

As far as the Dynamic Stability Control was concerned, co-ordination with the central 
dynamic handling controller on the Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) master con¬ 
trol unit had to be taken into consideration. And the new “dynamic handling control” 
function also affects the way the DSC operates. The thresholds and the nature of the 
DSC interventions have to be adapted to suit the setting selected. 

Thus the DSC doesn’t simply contain a setting that suits a luxury-class vehicle such as 
the F01/F02. Instead, several different settings have been developed which correspond 
to the characteristics of the various dynamic handling control settings. 

In addition to adaptation to handling characteristics, there are numerous other changes 
to the Dynamic Stability Control on the F01/F02 which relate to location, display fea¬ 
tures, fault diagnosis and repair. 

Starting from the basis of the system on the E70/E71, the electromechanical parking 
brake has been adapted to the reguirements of the F01/F02. That includes such things 
as location and attachment to the vehicle. In addition, design enhancements have been 
introduced to make the EMF actuator guieter in operation. 

This reference document sets out in detail all the changes to the Dynamic Stability 
Control and electromechanical parking brake that are specific to the F01/F02. 

However, features of the two systems that are familiar from the E70/ E71 are not repeat¬ 
ed in this document. Those details can be found in the respective training manuals.

Functions 


DSC Functions 

Overview 

The Dynamic Stability Control on the F01/F02 (DSC FOx) essentially incorporates the 
same functions as on the E70/E71 (DSC E7x). 

As the DSC FOx is based on the same highly advanced technology as the DSC E7x, all 
DSC functions on the F01/F02 achieve outstanding performance in terms of: 

• dynamic response (brake pressure can be generated extremely quickly). 

• control precision (brake pressure can be adjusted extremely precisely and without 
significant fluctuation). 

• noise emission (operation of the valves and the hydraulic pump is quieter than the 
previous generations). 

• tactile response (unpleasant feedback from the brake pedal has been substantially 
reduced, e.g. pedal vibration during brake modulation). 

Differences between the DSC functions on the E70/E71 and F01/F02 arise from the dif¬ 
ferent drivetrain configurations (4-wheel drive/rear-wheel drive). Therefore, the DSC FOx 
does not include the “Hill Descent Control (HDC)” function specific to 4-wheel drive 
vehicles. 

Instead of the 4-wheel-drive version of the automatic differential brake (ADB-X), the DSC 
FOx uses the version for vehicles with rear-wheel drive (ADB). 

A new subfunction of the ADB is that traction-control brake modulation is available even 
when the DSC is switched off. This subfunction is called “Electronic Differential Lock 
Control” and is described in one of the subsections below.

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 

















On previous vehicles, the DSC control unit contained the central dynamic handling con¬ 
trol functions. A dynamic handling control complex remains part of the DSC FOx. 

Flowever, it is controlled by the central dynamic handling controller on the ICM (as are the 
other dynamic handling systems). 

The ICM calculates the current handling status and the vehicle response desired by the 
driver. To do so, it makes use not only of the signals from the DSC sensor integrated in 
the ICM but also of those from external sensors such as the steering angle sensor and 
the wheel-speed sensors. If a difference between the response desired by the driver and 
the reaction of the vehicle is detected, the central dynamic handling controller on the ICM 
calculates a reguired compensatory yaw force. 

The purpose of that yaw force is to bring about a yawing motion on the part of the vehicle 
that is superimposed over the existing movement of the vehicle. In that way, the vehicle 
handling can be corrected retrospectively, so to speak, when it threatens to become 
unstable. The highly advanced DSC technology and the central dynamic handling 
controller on the ICM even make is possible to optimize handling characteristics in 
advance. One example of that is brake modulation for the purposes of improved agility, 
which is described in one of the subsections further on. 

Subordinate to the central dynamic handling controller on the ICM is an “actuator coordi¬ 
nation” function. It decides whether and to what degree the DSC dynamic handling 
system is to contribute to producing the reguired yaw force. 

The reguired force is signalled to the DSC’s dynamic handling controller, which puts it 
into action by operating the actuators represented by the brakes and drivetrain. 

Simple implementation of the settings specified by the ICM is, however, not the only task 
of the DSC’s dynamic handling controller on the F01/F02. It also continues to indepen¬ 
dently perform the following original DSC functions: 

• Anti-lock braking system (ABS) 

• Cornering Brake Control (CBC) 

• Automatic Stability Control (ASC) 

• Engine drag torgue control (MSR) 

• Automatic Differential Brake (ADB) 


15 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



The numerous additional functions over and above pure handling dynamics control are 
also carried out largely independently by the DSC and without intervention by the ICM. 

• Functions which help to reduce stopping distance: they include brake drying, brake 
standby, brake fade prevention and dynamic brake control. The efficiency of the 
brake standby and dynamic brake control functions is further improved in combina¬ 
tion with the “ACC Stop & Go” optional extra. 

• Convenience functions which make driving easier, e.g. Automatic Hold, which is per¬ 
formed by the DSC and EMF in combination. 

• The stresses on and wear of brake components are monitored with the aid of com¬ 
putation models. Based on information such as brake pressure and brake tempera¬ 
ture and the signals from the brake-pad wear sensors, a remaining service life 
expressed as a mileage is calculated. The owner can view that information as a sub¬ 
function of Condition Based Service and use it as an aid to planning servicing 
appointments.

DSC Displays and Controls 


New DSC symbols 

There is a new set of symbols for Dynamic Stability Control displays and controls. 

Starting on the F01/F02, this new DSC symbol set replaces the symbols previously used. 


Previously there were two different 
symbols displayed on the instrument clus¬ 
ter for the statuses “DTC mode” and “DTC 
off”. 

As of launch of the F01/F02, there is now 
only one symbol for both statuses. 
However, the drive can distinguish 
between the two statuses by means of 
additional information in text form. 

The new DSC symbol set relates not only 
to the display but also the labeling of the 
DTC button.

17 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 













The new symbols will gradually be introduced on all new vehicles as they are phased in. 
The reason for the change of symbols are the new legal reguirements which oblige all car 
manufacturers to use standardized display symbols. That will enable motorists to imme¬ 
diately recognize the controls and displays of a DSC system as such regardless of the 
brand of car they are driving. 

The regulations also reguire that even merely limited DSC function must result in display 
of the word “off”. That is the case in “DTC mode”, in which the stabilizing interventions 
take place at a later stage. 

DSC modes 

As familiar from previous vehicles, the Dynamic Stability Control on F01/F02 incorporates 
the following function modes: 

• DSC on 

• DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) 

• DSC off 

In the “DSC on” mode, all DSC functions are fully active. The stabilizing interventions in 
brake and engine function take place at an early stage. That makes it easier for less 
expert drivers to regain control of a vehicle that is becoming unstable. 

In “DTC mode” the stabilizing interventions take place at a slightly later stage. 

The Automatic Stability Control and Automatic Differential Brake functions allow a greater 
degree of wheelspin. That improves traction when pulling away on loose surfaces such 
as uncompacted snow. The dynamic handling control function does not come into 
action until a larger sideslip angle is reached than in “DSC on” mode. 

In “DSC off” mode, the stabilizing interventions by: 

• the dynamic handling controller, 

• the Automatic Stability Control and 
are switched off. 

Especially safety-critical DSC functions such as ABS remain fully active in all DSC 
modes, however. 

The mode “DSC off” is aimed at the undiluted driving experience, the direct connection 
between the driver, vehicle and the road. 

integration in dynamic handling control 

A new feature of the DSC modes on the F01 / F02 is that they are integrated in the 
dynamic handling control function. Dynamic handling control is activated by means of 
the handling setting switch and the DTC button. 

Dynamic handling control enables the driver to choose one of six possible vehicle hand¬ 
ing modes. The dynamic handling controller then controls all drivetrain and dynamic han¬ 
dling systems simultaneously and in co-ordination with one another. The result is totally 
harmonious handling in all modes. 

18

The vehicle handling modes are called: 

• Comfort 

• Normal 

• Sport 

• Sport+ 

• Traction 

• DSC off 

When the vehicle is first started, the dynamic 
handling controller is always in “Normal” mode. 

The table below shows what mode the Dynamic 
Stability Control is in for each of the vehicle han¬ 
dling modes. 

The other dynamic handling systems and 
drivetrain control systems are switched in and 
out as appropriate to the vehicle handling mode 
selected.

DSC Functions in Detail 


ADB Active Even When DSC is Off 

The DSC function ADB has been around for a long while on a wide variety of BMW vehi¬ 
cles and especially in the form of the ADB-X version on the xDrive models. 

If one of the wheels of a driven axle is spinning, it cannot transmit any driving force 
(torgue) to the road. And because the differential distributes the torgue egually between 
the two wheels, the other wheel on the axle can not transmit any driving force either. 

ADB brakes the spinning wheel so that the driving torgue and braking force are in equilib¬ 
rium on that wheel. Then, by virtue of the differential, an egual amount of driving torgue 
is applied to the wheel that is not spinning. And because that wheel is offered grip by the 
road surface, a driving force can be transmitted that results in forward motion of the 
vehicle. 

Thus ADB increases traction on slippery surfaces and has a similar effect to a differential 
lock. 


• On the xDrive models, ADB-X remains active even when the DSC is switch off in 
order to achieve improved traction, especially when driving off road. 

• On vehicles with rear-wheel drive, that individual braking of the driving wheels was 
previously only active when the DSC was active or in “DTC” mode. 

• On the new F01/F02 (and the top 1 Series and 3 Series models) that ADB subfunc¬ 
tion remains active even when the DSC is switched off. 

That function is called “Electronic Differential Lock Control” and uses the DSC to 
emulate the effect of a differential lock on the driving wheels. In contrast with previous 
arrangements, such brake modulation for the purposes of increasing drive transmission 
takes places even if the driver has switched off the DSC. 


20 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Brake Modulation for Increasing Agility 

The highly advanced hardware of the DSC FOx enables brake modulation to be carried 
out without unpleasant feedback for the driver. On the F01/F02, that capability is utilized 
to influence the vehicle’s self-steering characteristics is a specifically targeted way.

M 

Yaw force acting on the vehicle as a result of individual modulation of brakes 


If the vehicle begins to understeer, e.g. when cornering quickly, the central dynamic han¬ 
dling controller on the ICM detects the very first indications that it is starting to happen. 

A required setting is transmitted to the DSC requiring it to apply the brake on the rear 
wheel on the inside of the bend. The DSC sensitively applies the required setting and 
without generating a level of noise perceptible by the driver. The uneven braking effect 
thus produced, creates a yaw force acting around the vehicle’s center of gravity. As a 
result, the vehicle turns towards the inside of the bend, doesn’t understeer and corners 
with absolutely neutral handling. 

This type of brake modulation increases road safety because it prevents the vehicle drift¬ 
ing towards the outside of the bend. The disadvantage, however, is that the vehicle is 
slowed slightly by the application of the brake and thus a degree of momentum is lost. 


21 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 

















Therefore, in typical BMW fashion, the solution is taken a step further. Whenever handling 
stability considerations allow, the engine torque is increased simultaneously with brake 
application. The higher engine torque is transmitted to the road by the wheel on the out¬ 
side of the bend that is not being braked. The control strategy ensures that the increase 
exactly matches the retardation by the brake application. 

While that DSC function is active, there is no display of any kind on the instrument cluster. 

In that way, highly advanced components (DSC) and intelligent control strategies are 
combined to produce an overall effect that substantially improves agility without impairing 
the handling stability of the vehicle. 

Automatic Hold 

This function has been around since the E65, on which it was called “Auto-P”. The 
Automatic Hold function was also used on the E70/E71. 

Although the Automatic Hold function is computed on the DSC control unit, it can not be 
put into effect without an electromechanical parking brake (EMF). The EMF is always 
required whenever the DSC hydraulic modulator is unable to permanently hold the vehi¬ 
cle stationary. In particular, that is the case when the engine is switched off. 

When the Automatic Hold function is active, the driver first of all brakes the vehicle to a 
standstill. It is then held stationary by the DSC hydraulic modulator. That is achieved by 
maintaining the final brake pressure applied by the driver. If the vehicle starts to roll on an 
incline, the DSC hydraulic modulator actively generates brake pressure. 

Pressing the accelerator causes the brake pressure to be released and the vehicle starts 
to move again. Automatic holding and releasing of the brakes in that way makes driving in 
easier in conditions such as urban traffic and stopping at traffic lights or stop-and-go dri¬ 
ving in traffic tailbacks. 

After the engine is started, the function can be activated until the next time the engine is 
switched off. To do so, the driver’s door must be closed and the driver’s seatbelt fas¬ 
tened. The function can, of course, also be manually deactivated before the engine is 
switched. 

The footwell module reads the signal from the door switch. The ACSM control unit analy¬ 
ses the signal from the seat belt buckle contact. The two signals are transmitted to the 
DSC control unit via the bus systems. One signal that is not analysed for the Automatic 
Hold function on the F01/F02 is the driver’s seat occupancy signal. 

Conversely, the Automatic Hold function is automatically deactivated if the driver’s door is 
opened and the driver’s seatbelt unfastened. To prevent the vehicle rolling away in that 
situation, the EMF parking mode is activated. As long as the engine is running, the park¬ 
ing mode is effected by means of the DSC hydraulic modulator. If the driver switches the 
engine off, the function is taken over by the EMF actuator unit. 


22 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Note: Before the vehicle is driven into a car wash, the Automatic Hold function 
has to be deactivated as otherwise the brakes are applied when the vehi¬ 
cle is stationary and it can not be rolled. 

The Automatic Hold function is activated and deactivated by means of the button marked 
“AUTO H” on the center console. Activation of the function is acknowledged by the func¬ 
tion indicator lamp (green LED in the button). Whenever the green LED is lit, the 
Automatic Hold function is active. The status of the Automatic Hold function is also indi¬ 
cated on the instrument cluster. 

The various function statuses and how they are indicated are summarized below.

23 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 
























When Automatic Hold is holding the vehicle stationary, two additional internal DSC sub¬ 
functions are activated: roll-away monitoring and slide detection. 

The roll-away monitoring function is described in the section “EMF functions”. 

The slide detection function is designed to intervene if the vehicle starts to slide after 
stopping, i.e. if all four stationary wheels start to slip. That can happen on a steep slope 
when the road is slippery, for instance. If the driver were holding the vehicle stationary and 
became aware of such a situation, he/she would release the brake. In that way the vehicle 
can at least be steered as it rolls down the slope. 

The slide detection function is based on exactly the same principle. When the vehicle is 
being held stationary by Automatic Hold, the slide detection function monitors the signals 
from the wheel-speed sensors. The DSC releases the pressure on one of the brakes in 
alternation while keeping the others under pressure. If the wheel-speed sensor registers 
a movement from the wheel on which the brake is released, then obviously the entire 
vehicle must be moving. That means that the other wheels, on which the brakes are 
applied, must be sliding while locked. Under those circumstances, the condition “sliding” 
would be detected. 

The response to detection of sliding is progressive release of brake pressure so that the 
vehicle becomes steerable. The driver is made aware of the critical situation by a Check 
Control message and an audible warning signal. 

Interface for Adaptive Braking Assistance 

The function “Adaptive Braking Assistance” implemented as a co-ordinated strategy by 
the DSC and Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop & Go function is also available on the 
F01/F02. It is a function that was previously introduced on the E60/E61 LCI. 

The interface relates to two functions on the Dynamic Stability Control: 

• brake standby and 

• dynamic braking control. 

“Brake standby” can be activated by a request signal transmitted by the ICM control unit. 
That happens when a potential collision situation has been detected with the aid of the 
radar sensors. And, of course, “brake standby” is also activated if the internal DSC criteria 
familiar from previous models are met (minimum speed, rapid release of accelerator 
pedal). 

The threshold for triggering dynamic braking control can be influenced by ACC Stop & 
Go. If a potential collision situation is detected, the ICM control unit sends out a signal 
requesting lowering of the activation threshold. To be precise, the activation threshold is 
the rate of increase of brake pressure applied by the driver that has to be exceeded in 
order to dynamic braking control (braking assistance). That makes it easier for the driver to 
trigger dynamic braking control. This function is the only means by which a driver braking 
hesitantly can activate dynamic braking control.

DSC Components 


DSC Unit 

The DSC unit on the F01/F02 essentially uses the same technology as on the E70/E71. 

Versions 

The DSC unit comprises the DSC control unit and the hydraulic modulator. The two are 
attached to one another in such a way as to form a waterproof unit. 

The repair kits available are either 

• the complete DSC unit with pre-filled hydraulic modulator or 

• the DSC control unit on its own. 

There is a seal integrated in the casing of the DSC control unit at precisely the point 
where it joins the hydraulic modulator. That is the reason why the DSC control unit can 
be replaced separately (seal is replaced at the same time). The hydraulic modulator, by 
contrast, can not be replaced separately because the seal would be damaged when the 
two parts were separated. The reguired degree of waterproofing would then no longer 
be provided. 

There are two versions of the DSC unit which differ by virtue of the number of pressure 
sensors fitted.

the pressures in the front and rear brake circuits. The degree of accuracy obtained is suf¬ 
ficient for the functions of the dynamic handling systems and the cruise control with 
braking function. The optional extras ACC and ACC Stop & Go reguire a higher degree 
of accuracy for determining the brake pressure generated and modulated by the 
Dynamic Stability Control. Therefore, the two additional brake sensors are fitted in 
the front and rear brake circuits.

Hydraulic modulator 

With its highly advanced pump design, the hydraulic modulator also offers an enhanced 
degree of control accuracy. There are 2 groups of 3 pump elements with a diameter of 
6.5mm and intake-optimized units. This pump design produces, firstly, substantially 
improved pressure generation dynamics. And secondly, the pressure increments during 
pressure generation are smaller. Together with the improved design of the valves, the 
overall effect is less pedal feedback during brake modulation. 

For the driver this is noticeable in as far as the pedal pulsation can now only be felt very 
slightly during ABS braking. There is a pressure sensor for detecting the pressure applied 
by the driver in the hydraulic modulator.

DSC control unit 

Like the hydraulic modulator, the DSC control unit on the F01/F02 is also based on the 
one used on the E70/E71. 

Specifically, the following special features and differences should be noted: 

• FlexRay connection 

• Wiring of the new DTC button 

• Wheel-speed signals for electromechanical parking brake, Car Access System 
and Telematic Control Unit

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 
































The DSC control unit on the F01/F02 is connected to the FlexRay and not, as on previ¬ 
ous vehicles, to the PT-CAN and F-CAN. 

The FlexRay is brought to the DSC control unit (from the ZGM) and ends there. The DSC 
control unit is thus the terminal node of the FlexRay. Accordingly, it contains a terminal 
resistor for the FlexRay. 

On previous vehicles, the DTC button was electrically analysed by the IHKA control unit, 
for instance (E70/E71). On those vehicles, the button operation signal is transmitted via 
bus systems to the DSC control unit. 

The new DTC button on the F01/F02 is connected to the ICM control unit instead. The 
DTC button and the associated function is part of the “dynamic handling control” function 
on the F01/F02. As that, in turn, is computed on the ICM control unit, the DTC button 
has been connected to the ICM control unit. The ICM control unit then signals the 
appropriate vehicle handling mode via the FlexRay. The DSC control unit analyses the 
signalled mode and adapts its function accordingly. 

For the EMF and CAS control units, the information about vehicle standstill is of particular 
importance. For those two systems, the DSC control unit provides the DFA_EMF signal. 

It is a calculated signal computed from the speeds of the two rear wheels. It is transmitted 
as a pulse-width modulated signal on a dedicated line to the EMF and CAS control units. 

If there is a Telematic Control Unit (TCU) fitted on the vehicle but no navigation system, 
the TCU control unit has to take on the task of determining vehicle location. That is nec¬ 
essary for the manual and automatic emergency call functions. The signals from the GPS 
aerial are insufficient for that purpose as it has to be possible to determine the vehicle’s 
location even if the GPS signals are temporarily unavailable. In that case, the TCU control 
unit uses the speed signals from the two front wheels to calculate the road speed and 
changes of direction when cornering. The wheel-speed signals are provided by the DSC 
control unit and transmitted to the TCU control unit by a directly wired connection 
(DF_TCU_L and DF_TCU_R). 

The power supply for the DSC unit is split into three: control unit, valves and pump motor 
are supplied by separate leads. That prevents interference from the load circuits (induc¬ 
tive loads) being transferred to the electronic circuitry. 

The DSC control unit is also connected to the wake-up line. The wake-up line is used to 
wake up the DSC control unit. 

Location and repair 

The DSC unit is located in the vehicle underbody, set back somewhat from the wheel 
arch. That location applies to both left and right-hand-drive vehicles.

Six short lengths of hydraulic pipe are connected to the DSC unit by screw-fit unions. 

Four of those hydraulic pipes run upwards from the hydraulic modulator and terminate at 
a block with quick-release unions. They are connected by those quick-release unions to 
the pipes running off to other parts of the vehicle. Specifically, that is the two pipes to the 
left and right front brakes and the two pipes to the tandem master cylinder. 


30 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 





















The two remaining hydraulic pipes run to the rear. They are connected by quick-fit unions 
to the pipes running off to other parts of the vehicle. In this case, they lead to the left and 
right rear brakes. 

If the DSC unit has to be replaced, first of all the vehicle underbody trim has to be 
removed in the appropriate places. When the DSC unit is removed, the six short lengths 
of hydraulic pipe referred to above are removed with it. Therefore, before removal, the four 
quick-release unions (4) and the two screw-fit unions (8) have to be disconnected. The 
short lengths of hydraulic pipe subsequently have to be removed and fitted to the new 
DSC unit. 

Only after the DSC unit has been removed can the DSC control unit be separated from 
the hydraulic modulator, if necessary, and new one fitted. 

The braking system must always be bled whenever the DSC unit has been removed and 
refitted/replaced. 

The precise procedures for the individual repair operations in connection with the DSC 
unit are described in the Repair Instructions.

Sensors for DSC 
Wheel speed sensors 

The same type of wheel-speed sensor is used on the F01/F02 as on the E70/E71 
(DF11 i made by Robert Bosch GmbH). 

They are four active wheel-speed sensors, all four of which are connected by dedicated 
two-core leads directly to the DSC control unit. The wheel-speed data is transmitted to 
the DSC control unit as a pulse-width-modulated signal. 

The active wheel speed sensors enable detection of direction of rotation and clearance 
gap. 

Detection of direction of rotation is reguired for the hill-start assistance and Automatic 
Hold functions, among others. The clearance-gap sensing function allows sensor posi¬ 
tioning faults to be detected. If there is too much play in the wheel bearings, the wheel- 
speed signal can also become unreliable. That situation is also detectable by the clear¬ 
ance-gap sensing capability of the wheel-speed sensors. 

It can therefore be guaranteed that the DSC control unit only operates on the basis of 
correctly detected wheel-speed signals.

The DSC control unit broadcasts the wheel-DSC sensor in ICM speed sensor signals via 
the FlexRay network and directly wired links to the other systems on the vehicle. 

The DSC sensor, which was previously a separate component, has been integrated in the 
ICM control unit on the F01/F02.

With the aid of the signals from those integrated sensors and the wheel-speed signals 
provided by the DSC control unit, the ICM control unit calculates the following variables 
that are of significance for the vehicle’s dynamic handling status: 

• Road speed 

• Linear acceleration and pitch 

• Lateral acceleration and roll 

• Yaw rate 

Steering-angle sensor in SZL 

With the aid of the steering-angle sensor, the SZL is able to provide the following signals 
via the FlexRay bus system: 

• Steering angle 

• Steering rate 

Those variables are used as input signals by the dynamic handling systems to determine 
the driver’s intention when cornering. On the F01/F02 it is important to note that the 
steering-angle sensor signals are first analysed by the ICM control unit and then provided 
to control units of the other dynamic handling systems as the “effective steering-angle 
signal”. 

Detection of the steering angle and the steering rate is performed by an optical proximity 
sensor, the optical steering angle sensor. 


34 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 
























Information such as the absolute steering angle or the steering wheel rotation is calculat¬ 
ed. The optical steering-angle sensor detects steering angles from -640° to +640°. 

If the SZL suffers a power loss, e.g. if the battery terminals are disconnected, the steering 
wheel rotation data is lost. The SZL is then initially unable to determine the absolute 
steering angle and can only identify the relative steering angle. 

This temporary fault status can be remedied by turning the steering wheel from lock to 
lock. Alternatively, the SZL can detect the straight-ahead position from the wheel-speed 
signals from the front wheels when driving in a straight line. 

In either case, the absolute steering angle is then known again.

Service Information 


Important Points for Servicing and Repairs 


Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) 

General details 

Note: The modes “Dynamic Traction Control” (DTC) and “DSC off” are still 
used on the F01/ F02. However, on the F01/F02, the DSC modes are 
integrated in the “dynamic handling control” function, which rather 
than controlling individual systems, controls the system complex of 
all drivetrain and dynamic handling systems. 


Note: There is a new set of symbols for DSC displays and controls on the 
F01/F02. 


DSC symbols 




Automatic hold function 

The Automatic Hold function is activated/ deactivated by means of a button on the cen¬ 
ter console control panel. The Automatic Hold status is indicated by the function indica¬ 
tor lamp on the button and an indicator lamp on the instrument cluster. 











For Automatic Hold to be activated, the driver's seatbelt must be fastened and the dri¬ 
ver's door closed. 

Note: Before the vehicle is driven into a car wash, the Automatic Hold function 
has to be deactivated as otherwise the brakes are applied when the vehi¬ 
cle is stationary and it can not be rolled. 

DSC unit 

There are two versions of the DSC unit which have either one or three pressure sensor(s) 
(vehicles without/with “Active Cruise Control” optional extra) 

Note: The repair kits available are either 

• the complete DSC unit with pre-filled hydraulic modulator or 

• the DSC control unit on its own. 

The hydraulic modulator can not be replaced separately. 

Note: The DSC unit is located in the vehicle underbody, set back somewhat 
from the wheel arch. 

Note: If the DSC unit has to be replaced, first of all the vehicle underbody trim 
has to be removed. 

When the DSC unit is removed, the six short lengths of hydraulic pipe are 
removed with it. Therefore, before removal, the four quick-release 
unions at the top and the two screw-fit unions at the bottom have to be 
disconnected from the hydraulic pipes. 

The short lengths of hydraulic pipe subsequently have to be removed 
and fitted to the new DSC unit. 


37 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Signals and sensors 

Note: The wheel speed sensors are connected to the DSC control unit. The 

DSC control unit processes the wheel-speed sensor signals and broad¬ 
casts them via the FlexRay network to other systems, in particular the 
Integrated Chassis Management. 

Note: The DSC control unit does not only provide the wheel-speed signals in 
the form of bus signals. They are transmitted to the EMF, CAS and TCU 
control units by direct wired links. 

Note: The DSC sensor, which was a separate component on previous vehicles, 
has been integrated in the ICM control unit. The ICM control unit 
processes the important sensor signals for the Dynamic Stability 
Control and supplies them in the form of bus signals. Those signals are: 

• Yaw rate 

• Transverse acceleration 

• Linear acceleration 

• Steering angle 

• Vehicle speed. 

Note: The DSC sensor in the ICM control unit has to be calibrated if 

• the ICM control unit has been replaced or 

• the testing sequence on the diagnosis system demands it on the 
basis of a fault memory entry. 

Calibration must be performed with the vehicle on a surface that is level 
both lengthways and side to side. Terminal 15 must also be switched on. 


38 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Note: If at least one of the following conditions exists, the steering column 
switch cluster has to perform steering-angle sensor calibration: 

• Wheel alignment carried out 

• SZL replaced or re-programmed 

• Diagnosis system test procedure specifies calibration. 

Note: When calibrating the steering angle sensor, the instructions given by 
the diagnosis system must be followed precisely. 

The vehicle must be standing on a level surface during calibration. The 
steering wheel must be aligned visually in the straight-ahead position.

Overview of EMF Functions 


Normal Operation 

Parking brake application 

The driver can activate the EMF parking brake function by pulling on the parking brake 
button. Thus the way in which the parking brake button is operated emulates the action 
of a handbrake lever. 

The signal from the parking brake button is read by the EMF control unit and transmitted 
to the DSC control unit as a bus signal. The DSC control unit then decides whether to 
use the DSC hydraulic modulator or the EMF actuator unit to implement the parking 
brake function. If the engine is running, the vehicle is held stationary by using the DSC 
hydraulic modulator; otherwise the EMF actuator unit is used. 

The parking brake function is possible at any logical terminal status, i.e. at: 

• Terminal 0 

• Terminal R 

• Terminal 15 (and Terminal 50) 

Parking brake application at Terminal 0 is specifically made possible by the fact that the 
EMF control unit is supplied by Terminal 30 and the parking brake button is connected 
directly to the EMF control unit. If the driver operates the parking brake button at Terminal 
0, the EMF control unit is woken up. The EMF control unit in turn wakes up the other 
control units on the vehicle. Only then can the EMF control unit receive the important sig¬ 
nals relating to vehicle standstill. In addition, the changed status of the parking brake can 
be displayed after the system has been woken up. 

The status “parking brake on” is indicated by a red LED on the parking brake button and 
an indicator lamp on the instrument cluster. 

The driver does not have to operate any other controls to apply the parking brake. 

Once the parking brake is on, pulling the parking brake button again has no effect.

Roll-away monitoring 

The roll-away monitoring function is computed on the DSC control unit. It is active while 
the vehicle is being held stationary by: 

• the DSC hydraulic modulator or 

• the EMF actuator unit. 

The condition for activation of roll-away monitoring is thus that either the EMF parking 
brake function or the Automatic Hold function is active. 

Roll-away monitoring observes the signals from the wheel-speed sensors. If any of the 
wheel-speed sensors signals movement of the wheel, that indicates that the vehicle is 
rolling. Since, however, the vehicle is supposed to be stationary by virtue of the brake 
pressure applied by the hydraulic system or the EMF actuator, the roll-away monitoring 
function has to intervene. The hydraulic brake pressure is increased by control signals to 
the DSC hydraulic modulator or EMF electric motor in order to increase the braking force. 
In that way the rolling is counteracted. 

Release 

In similar fashion to the operation of a handbrake lever, the EMF is released by pushing 
the parking brake button in. 

But in order that the parking brake function is actually cancelled, Terminal 15 must also 
be on and one of the following conditions must be met: 

• Brake pedal depressed or 

• Automatic transmission parking lock engaged. 

That prevents the vehicle rolling away if another occupant of the vehicle apart from the 
driver presses in the parking brake button (child safety feature). 

Once the parking brake is released, the function indicator lamp on the parking brake but¬ 
ton and the indicator lamp on the instrument cluster go out.

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 









Dynamic braking 

The law requires that vehicles have two means of applying the brakes. On the F01/F02, 
the second means (the brake pedal being the first) is the parking brake button on the 
center console. 

If the parking brake button is pulled out while the vehicle is in motion, a defined degree of 
braking is applied by the DSC system. That function is intended for emergency situations 
in which the driver is unable to apply the brakes by pressing the brake pedal. Other occu¬ 
pants of the vehicle can also bring the vehicle to a standstill in that way if, for example, the 
driver suddenly loses consciousness. 

Dynamic braking hydraulically applies brake pressure at all four brakes. The stabilization 
functions of Dynamic Stability Control remain fully functional and the brake lights are 
switched on. That represents a major advantage over a manual parking brake. 

Braking takes place only while the parking brake button is pulled out. The degree of 
deceleration set by the DSC is increased progressively from initially 3 m/s2 to 5 m/s2. 

During dynamic braking, the parking brake indicator light on the instrument cluster comes 
on. In addition, a Check Control message and an audible warning signal are issued to 
make the driver aware of the critical situation. 

If the driver uses the brake pedal and the parking brake button at the same time to slow 
down, the DSC control unit prioritizes. The greater braking requirement is put into effect. 

If dynamic braking is continued to the point of standstill, the vehicle continues to be held 
stationary after the parking brake button is released. The indicator lamp on the instrument 
cluster remains on. The driver can then release the parking brake (as described above). 


42 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Emergency release 

A mechanical emergency release facility is provided in order to be able to release the 
parking brake in the event of the electromechanical actuator unit failing or insufficient 
power supply. 

Note: Caution: secure vehicle to prevent it rolling before operating the emer¬ 
gency release! 

Note: After a power supply failure, it may still not be possible to move the vehi¬ 
cle even after releasing the brake with the emergency release facility. 

The automatic transmission parking lock may still be engaged. 

In that case, the parking brake must first be released with the emergency 
release facility. Then the automatic transmission parking lock must be 
released using the emergency release facility. To do so, the appropriate 
tool must remain engaged in the parking lock emergency release. 

The parking brake emergency release status is indicated on the instrument cluster. 

The parking brake indicator lamp shows yellow. 



Indication of “parking brake emergency release/fault” 


The driver is shown the same indication (together with a check control message) if the 
parking brake has a fault. 

When the parking brake is to be used again after an emergency release, that can not be 
done mechanically but only electrically. It reguires pushing in the parking brake button 
once as if to release the parking brake. The familiar conditions for releasing the parking 
brake must also be met. 


43 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Service Function 


Installation Mode 

EMF installation mode is required for the purposes of replacing the EMF actuator unit or 
the brake cables. The EMF can be set to installation mode with the aid of the BMW diag¬ 
nosis system. This mode is comprized of two subfunctions: 

• Setting the EMF actuator unit to the installation position 

• Preventing the EMF parking brake function. 

To set the unit to the installation position, the brake cables are extended to the maximum 
length. That is the essential requirement for being able to remove and refit the cables. 

While work is being carried out on the actuator unit, the brake cables or the duo-servo 
parking brake, the EMF must not be inadvertently or deliberately applied. Doing so would 
risk causing injury. Installation mode prevents the EMF parking brake function. 

That means that pulling out the parking brake button as if to apply the parking brake has 
no effect. 

Installation mode is indicated on the instrument cluster by the parking brake indicator 
lamp flashing yellow. 



Indication of parking-brake installation mode 

Installation mode can be cancelled in two ways: 

• By the performing the service function “Reset installation mode” using the BMW 
diagnosis system 

• By driving the vehicle; when doing so, a minimum speed must be exceeded. 

Once installation mode has been successfully cancelled, the parking-brake indicator lamp 
on the instrument panel goes out. 


44 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Running-in the Brakes 

The function for running-in the parking brakes only has to be carried out if 

• the linings of the duo-servo parking brakes have been replaced or 

• the rear brake discs have been replaced. 

In either case, a material/surface pairing then initially exists which does not yet have the 
optimum frictional properties. That means that the reguired braking forces could not be 
achieved. 

The brake running-in function removes play between the two surfaces forming the fric¬ 
tional pairing, i.e. the brake linings and the inside of the brake disc recess. It also wears-in 
the surfaces. Both operations are essential to achieving the reguired frictional coefficient 
between the two surfaces. 

The brake running-in function is prepared with the aid of the BMW diagnosis system. 

It is started by pulling out the parking brake button once. The parking brake indicator lamp 
flashes red throughout the entire seguence. 

While running-in the parking brakes, the EMF applies a defined force to the duo-servo 
parking brakes. That force is substantially lower than the brake force reguired to hold the 
vehicle stationary. The rear wheels are then rotated either on a brake dynamometer or by 
driving the vehicle on the road. 

Note: The precise procedure for running-in the parking brakes is described in 
the Repair Instructions under the heading “Adjusting the parking 
brake”. The instructions given there must be followed exactly. 


45 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



EMF Components 

This section deals only with the special features of the actuator unit and the controls for 
the electromechanical parking brake. On the F01/F02, as on numerous other BMW 
models, the braking force for the parking brake is produced by the familiar duo-servo 
parking brakes on the two rear wheels. 

EMF Actuator Unit 

The complete EMF actuator unit and especially the electric motor and gearing have been 
optimized for use on the F01/F02. That is noticeable in particular by guieter operation 
during actuation. 

The EMF actuator unit is made up of the following main components: 

• EMF control unit 

• Electric motor 

• Gearbox 

• Force sensor 

Those components are housed in a plastic casing that can not be opened. In the event of 
a fault, the EMF actuator unit can only be replaced as a complete unit.

EMF control unit 

As on the E70, the EMF control unit on the F01/F02 is integrated in the actuator unit 
casing and is also identical in design to the one on the E70. It is the actuation controller 
for the EMF functions. It therefore controls the electric motor and reads the signals from 
the force sensor. 

The most important control signal from outside is that from the parking brake button. 

The parking brake button is directly wired to the EMF control unit. 

The EMF control unit is connected to the PTCAN. Integrated in the EMF control unit is 
one of the two terminal resistors for the PT-CAN. The EMF control unit communicates via 
the PT-CAN with its most important partner, the DSC control unit. As the DSC control 
unit is only connected to the FlexRay, the central gateway module is reguired to transfer 
the signals between the PT-CAN and the FlexRay. 

A special place among the input signals is occupied by the information relating to vehicle 
standstill. The EMF actuator unit must not be activated while the vehicle is moving but 
rather only when it is stationary. Otherwise, the vehicle handling would become unstable 
due to the rear wheels locking up. The EMF control unit detects vehicle standstill on the 
basis of the following three input signals: 

• Road speed (provided by Integrated Chassis Management via bus systems) 

• Rear axle speed (provided by engine management via PT-CAN) 

• Wheel-speed signal “DFA_EMF” (calculated by Dynamic Stability Control and trans¬ 
mitted via direct wired link to EMF control unit). 

Only when those three signals definitively indicate vehicle standstill does the EMF control 
unit allow operation of the actuator unit.

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 






























Force sensor 

Technically speaking, the force sensor is a travel sensor that operates according to the 
Hall effect. Between the two brake cables there is a spring with a defined strength. That 
strength is stored on the EMF control unit. Therefore, it can determine the force acting 
on the cables from the change in the length of the spring. 

The force acting on the brake cables is an important input variable for the control algo¬ 
rithm on the EMF control unit. When the parking brake is applied, the EMF control unit 
has to ensure that a specific required force is applied to the brake cables. The EMF con¬ 
trol unit calculates that required force on the brake cables directly from the legally required 
holding force on the wheels. The latter has to be great enough to safely keep the vehicle 
stationary on an uphill or downhill gradient of up to 20 %. 

Over the life of the cables, a slight degree of stretching can occur. However, that does not 
corrupt the force-sensor signal. The spring does not, of course, start to compress until a 
force is acting on the cables. If, due to stretching, the cables are initially loose when in the 
released position, then no force is acting on the spring. Only when a force is applied to 
the cables, and, therefore, to the spring by operation of the electric motor does the spring 
compress. Then the force sensor sends the appropriate signal to the EMF control unit. 


49 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Bracket 

To attach the EMF actuator unit to the vehicle’s structural components, a multi-angled 
bracket is used. That design allows the EMF actuator unit itself to remain virtually identi¬ 
cal in dimensions (to the one on the E70/ E71). Adaptation to the geometry of the 
surrounding components on the different vehicles is achieved by the specific design of 
the mounting bracket. 

The bracket for the EMF actuator unit locates at the top on a boss on the rear suspension 
subframe. Fixing of the bracket at the bottom differs according to whether the vehicle is 
fitted with Integrated Active Steering or not. Vehicles with Integrated Active Steering have 
an actuator for the rear-wheel steering on the rear suspension. The bracket for the EMF 
actuator then rests on the rear-wheel steering actuator bracket. The two brackets are 
joined by two bolts.

The bracket and the EMF actuator unit itself are also attached to one another by bolts. 
If replacement is necessary, both the bracket and the EMF actuator unit itself can be 
ordered as separate parts.

Controls 


Parking Brake Button 

The parking brake button supplies the EMF control unit with the button operation signal. 
The signal is duplicated on the parking brake button and transmitted to the EMF control 
unit via double direct wired connections. It not only enables the EMF control unit to dis¬ 
tinguish between the resting position and the two directions of operation (release/apply). 
Faults can also be detected (e.g. broken circuit, short circuit). If such a fault is detected, 
the function of the parking brake can still be maintained in most cases. 

Parking brake button with function indicator lamp 



In contrast with the button on the E70/E71, the parking brake button on the F01/F02 has 
a function indicator lamp. It is an LED that tells the driver when the parking brake is on. 
The EMF control unit directly controls that LED. 

It is important to note that the button directly behind it for the Automatic Hold function is 
not wired to the EMF control unit but to the DSC control unit.

Emergency release 

The cable for emergency release of the parking brake is accessible via the trunk. 

However, the cable is located underneath the trunk floor trim, which on the F01/F02 
can not be simply taken out.

Once the trunk floor trim has been removed, the emergency release cable is directly 
accessible. The handle of the release tool is hooked onto the end of the emergency 
release cable by means of the slot provided. 

Pulling the cable up operates the emergency release mechanism in the EMF actuator 
unit. There is a noticeable jolt when it releases. The cables to the two duo-servo parking 
brakes are then released from the force acting on them. The parking brake is thus 
released.

Electromechanical Parking Brake (EMF) 


General details 

The electromechanical parking brake (EMF) is applied/released by means of the parking 
brake button on the center console control panel. The parking brake status is indicated 
by the function indicator lamp on the button and an indicator lamp on the instrument 
cluster. 

Indication of "parking brake on" 



The EMF can be applied in all logical terminal statuses (Terminal 0, Terminal R, Terminal 
15, Terminal 50). The conditions for release of the EMF are: Terminal 15 active and brake 
pedal depressed or automatic transmission parking lock engaged. 


56 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 


Emergency release 

The EMF can be released in an emergency by means of a cable. That cable is accessible 

through the trunk and is under the trunk floor trim. To effect emergency release of the 

EMF, the red T-shaped handle from the vehicle toolkit is reguired. 

Note: Caution: Secure vehicle to prevent it rolling before operating the emer¬ 
gency release! 

Note: After a power supply failure, it may still not be possible to move the vehi¬ 
cle even after releasing the brake with the emergency release facility. 

The automatic transmission parking lock may still be engaged. 

In that case, the parking brake must first be released with the emergency 
release facility. Then the automatic transmission parking lock must be 
released using the emergency release facility. The appropriate tool must 
remain engaged in the parking lock emergency release for that purpose. 

Note: When the parking brake is to be used again after an emergency release, 
it can only be done by pushing in the parking brake button. The familiar 
conditions for releasing the parking brake must also be met. 

Installation mode 

Note: Installation mode sets the EMF actuator unit to the installation position 
(brake cables extended to maximum). It also prevents the EMF being 
accidentally applied, e.g. when carrying out repairs. 

Note: Installation mode can be cancelled either by means of a service function 
or by driving the car.

Running-in the brakes 

While running-in the parking brakes, the EMF applies a defined force to the duo-servo 
parking brakes. 

Note: The function for running-in the parking brakes only has t 
be carried out if: 

• the linings of the duo-servo parking brakes have been replaced or 

• the rear brake discs have been replaced. 

Note: The precise procedure for running-in the parking brakes is described in 
the Repair Instructions under the heading “Adjusting the parking 
brake”. The instructions given there must be followed exactly. 

EMF actuating unit 

The EMF actuator unit is made up of the following main components: 

• EMF control unit 

• Electric motor 

• Gearbox 

• Force sensor. 

Note: In the event of a fault, the EMF actuator unit can only be replaced as a 
complete unit. 

Note: The following are available as separate parts: 

• the EMF actuator unit itself 

• the bracket for the EMF actuator unit and 

• the cables. 

Note: The EMF control unit detects vehicle standstill on the basis of the fol¬ 
lowing signals: 

• Road speed (from ICM) 

• Rear axle speed (from DME) 

• Wheel-speed signal “DFA_EMF” (from DSC). 

58 

F01 Longitudinal Dynamics Systems 



Only when those three signals definitively indicate vehicle standstill does the 
EMF control unit allow operation of the actuator unit. 


Note: The EMF control unit is connected to the PT-CAN. Integrated in the EMF 
control unit is a terminal resistor for the PT-CAN. 

Note: The EMF control unit is connected to the wake-up line. 

If the driver operates the parking brake button at Terminal 0, the EMF 
control unit is woken up. The EMF control unit in turn wakes up the other 
control units on the vehicle via the wake-up line. 

Note: On vehicles with the Integrated Active Steering optional extra, the 
bracket for the EMF actuator unit is bolted to the bracket for the HSR 
actuator. 

On vehicles without Integrated Active Steering, the bracket for the EMF 
actuator unit is bolted to the rear suspension subframe.
