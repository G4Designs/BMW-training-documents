Introduction 


Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) 

History 

A central, higher-level driving dynamics control system was first introduced in BMW 
vehicles several years ago. 

The introduction of the longitudinal dynamics management system in the BMW 3 Series 
(E9x) was the first step in this direction. The longitudinal dynamics control functions, 
Dynamic Cruise Control and Active Cruise Control, were integrated into one control unit, 
the LDM control unit. These integrated functions considerably enhanced the harmony 
and coordination of drive and brake actuation. 

The Vertical Dynamics Management made its debut in the BMW X5 (E70) with the VDM 
control unit: the integrated Vertical Dynamics Control (VDC) function controls the 
adjustable dampers. In contrast to the earlier system, not only ride-level heights and 
vertical acceleration are used as the input signals. Instead, the higher-level control 
strategy of the Vertical Dynamics Control takes all signals relevant to driving dynamics 
into account, including, for example, road speed, and longitudinal and lateral acceleration. 

The VDM control unit also coordinates the Vertical Dynamic Control and Active Roll 
Stabilization (ARS) functions. Overall, this meant that wheel contact with the road 
surface was improved and the vertical movement of the body reduced for a wider variety 
of road situations. 

In addition to the VDM control unit, the BMW X6 (E71) was also eguipped with an ICM 
control unit that for the first time incorporates both the longitudinal and lateral dynamics 
control functions. The longitudinal and lateral motion of the vehicle is evaluated centrally 
in the ICM control unit. 

Following on from this development, the dynamic driving systems Active Steering and 
Dynamic Performance Control are now used and their interaction is of course also 
coordinated by the ICM control unit. 

Significant at this stage is the definition of the ICM as the main control unit for the 
control functions. The actuators on the other hand are activated by control units specially 
intended for this purpose.

The red triangles denote interaction between the control units and functions. This is not 
always purely be an exchange of sensor signals. Control signals and reference values may 
be also used (for example) to influence the driving dynamics control in the ICM control 
unit or the Active Roll Stabilization in the VDM control unit.

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 
















New Control Units 

Two newly developed control units for dynamic driving systems will also be used in the 
F01/F02: 

• Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) and 

• Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM). 

Although their names are already familiar from the E70/E71, they differ considerably in 
their functional range and design. 

A multitude of driving dynamics functions is concentrated in these control units. 

In addition to central signal provision, the essential functions of the ICM control unit are 
concerned with longitudinal and lateral dynamics. These include the control function for 
the new Integral Active Steering, for example. 

The vertical dynamics functions on the other hand are incorporated in the VDM control 
unit: Vertical Dynamics Control in the 2nd generation and Active Roll Stabilization (also: 
Dynamic Drive). 

Although both control units are standard eguipment, two expansion stages are available 
in each case, depending on the options fitted to the vehicle. 

ICM control unit expansion stages 

The basic version of the ICM control unit is fitted as standard in the F01/F02. In this case, 
the vehicle is provided with the Servotronic steering system and cruise control driver 
assistance function with braking function. 

The high-performance version of the ICM control unit is used if one or both of the follow¬ 
ing options are ordered by the customer: 

• Integral Active Steering 

• Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function 

Expansion stages of VDM control unit 

The basic version of the VDM control unit contains the Vertical Dynamics Control func¬ 
tion. This is included in the standard eguipment of the F01/F02. 

The high-performance version of the VDM control unit is fitted if the customer also orders 
the option Active Roll Stabilization (ARS). The high-performance version also incorpo¬ 
rates the output stages reguired for activation of the hydraulic valves in the ARS.

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 



New Evolution Stage in Driving Dynamics Control 

The notion of “Integrated Chassis Management” is significantly developed further in the 
F01/F02. The two main objectives were to improve the performance and interaction of 
the individual dynamic driving systems. In order to achieve the desired dynamic effect in 
each road situation, the most suitable actuator can now be selected and activated. It may 
of course be useful to operate several actuators in tandem. Examples of this are activating 
the brakes for individual wheels or superimposing a steering angle using Integral Active 
Steering. 

A further task of the ICM control unit is to make the driving dynamics condition available 
throughout the entire vehicle through in the form of signals. This is why the DSC sensor 
in the F01/F02, which was previously fitted separately, has now been integrated into the 
ICM control unit. 

This means that all systems have access to the same information provided by the ICM 
control unit. As a conseguence, the potential for errors, particularly in networked systems, 
is reduced and the system reliability of systems is increased. Further, this simplifies the 
diagnosis of the interconnected system as the fault code memory entries for the driving 
dynamics signals are now stored centrally in the ICM control unit and are no longer 
distributed between many control units.

The result for the customer is perfect harmony in terms of vehicle handling - irrespective 
of the equipment specification and road situation. This uses the possibilities for maximiz¬ 
ing convenience, agility and stability to the full. 

The customer’s experience of this harmony in terms of vehicle handling is especially 
enhanced by the new Driving Dynamics Control function. This offers several particu¬ 
larly distinctive vehicle characteristics that determine how the vehicle handling as a whole 
is perceived by the driver and passengers. The driver can use the driving dynamics 
switch to select a characteristic that perfectly matches the specific driving requirement 
or section of road.

Functions 


Integrated Chassis Management 

Overview 

With the E71, the notion of a higher-level driving dynamics control system was imple¬ 
mented for the first time in a standard model. This central function is also referred to as 
“Integrated Chassis Management” (“ICM” for short) and is integrated in the control unit 
of the same name in the E71. 

The previous strategy was to use one control unit to perform the control tasks for each 
main movement direction. This approach was not employed in the E71 or the F01/F02.

As is the case in the E71, the new ICM control unit in the F01/F02 essentially performs 
the calculations for the control functions that influence the longitudinal and lateral 
dynamics. The actuators are activated by separate control units (e.g. AS control unit). 
The functional range of the ICM control unit in the F01/F02 has grown considerably 
when compared to the E71. 

The Vertical Dynamics Management (VDM) is still responsible for controlling the vertical 
dynamics. The vertical dynamic control and dynamic drive functions are therefore 
accommodated in the VDM control unit. Signals that provide information on the current 
driving situation are obviously exchanged between the ICM and VDM. 

The main focus of this section is to describe the functions of the ICM control unit. 

An introductory overview of these functions is provided in the following illustration and 
explanation. The functions are dealt with in more depth in the following chapters.

Signal Provision 

The ICM control unit reads signals from external and also internal sensors. These sensor 
signals are processed and converted into physical signals that describe the driving 
dynamics of the vehicle, and are subsequently made available to a large number of sys¬ 
tems in the vehicle. Examples of these signals are road speed and lateral acceleration. 

The central driving dynamics control system in the ICM firstly evaluates the current dri¬ 
ving condition and driver's command, also taking the dynamic driving systems installed in 
the vehicle into account. 


21 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 














On the basis of this information, the system decides whether or not to intervene in the 
driving dynamics, and also the extent the intervention. The highly intelligent dynamic 
driving systems permit slight and barely noticeable interventions as soon as e.g. a 
tendency towards understeering is detected. 

A coordinator ensures that the most suitable actuator is activated in each case. 

Where several actuators are used simultaneously, a great deal of importance has 
been placed on ensuring that these interventions are in perfect harmony. 

The driving dynamics control provides the driver with the choice of one of four driving 
dynamics settings (Normal, Comfort, Sport and Sport+). By making this choice, the driver 
influences the central driving dynamics control system and therefore all dynamic driving 
systems and drive train systems. All systems are matched appropriately to every setting 
and, most importantly, their interaction with each other within one specific setting is also 
perfectly coordinated. The status of the Dynamic Stability Control is also taken into 
account thus ensuring that two additional driving dynamics specifications are possible. 

The ICM control unit is also responsible for the Servotronic function including valve actu¬ 
ation. This steering control function is also influenced by the driving dynamics control. 

Driver Assistance Functions 

The ICM control unit incorporates the “Cruise control with braking” and “Active Cruise 
Control with Stop & Go” control functions. In addition, the ICM coordinates activation of 
the vibration actuator in the steering wheel for the “Lane Departure Warning” and “Active 
Blind Spot Detection” driver assistance functions. 

Signal Provision 

Signals from integrated sensor system 

The sensors that were previously accommodated separately in the DSC sensor are now 
installed in the ICM control unit. The following variables can be recorded with these 
sensors. 

• Longitudinal acceleration and pitch of the road or vehicle in the longitudinal direction 

• Lateral acceleration and pitch of road or vehicle in lateral direction 

• Rotational speed around vertical axis (yaw rate) 

The sensor signals are initially referenced to the sensor housing. However, to be useful to 
the dynamic driving systems, these variables must be referenced to the vehicle coordi¬ 
nate system. The ICM control unit performs the necessary conversion. A synchronization 
process is carried out when the ICM control unit is started up during which appropriate 
correction values are determined and saved. 


22 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 



Note: Calibration of the sensors integrated into the ICM control unit is 
necessary in the following cases: 

• the ICM control unit has been replaced or 

• if requested by the test schedule in the diagnostic 
system due to a fault code memory entry. 

The calibration must be performed with the vehicle standing on a level 
surface in the longitudinal and lateral direction. Terminal 15 must be 
switched on. 

Signals from External Sensors 

The ICM control unit imports the following signals that are important for dynamic driving 
systems from external sources: 

• Wheel speeds, four signals transmitted via FlexRay from DSC. 

• Ride-level heights, four signals, wired directly to ICM control unit. 

• Steering wheel angle, transmitted via FlexRay from steering column switch cluster. 

• Position of actuators for Active Steering and rear axle slip angle control, transmitted 
via FlexRay. 

The ICM calculates the actual speed at which the vehicle moves along the driving axis 
on the road based on the four wheel-speed signals. If dynamic driving systems inter¬ 
vene and affect the wheel speeds, this is taken into account in the calculation. The status 
of the ABS control (for example) is also imported in this instance. 

The road speed thus determined for the first time in the F01/F02 is now used as the ref¬ 
erence for practically all systems in the vehicle. This means that a multiple calculation no 
longer needs to be performed in many other control units. 

The ICM control unit also derives the following information from the wheel-speed signals: 

• Distance travelled 

• Wheel tolerance check: The marginal differences in wheel speeds (e.g. due to 
differences in tire diameter) are identified and adjusted by the ICM. 

• Snow chain detection: If snow chains are fitted, the driver can enter this informa¬ 
tion manually via the Central Information Display. The wheel speeds are also used 
by the HSR control unit to automatically determine whether snow chains are mount¬ 
ed on the rear wheels. The result of this identification is transmitted to the ICM 
control unit via the FlexRay. 


23 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 



Although, from a theoretical standpoint, it may be more appropriate to assign the ride- 
height sensors to the Vertical Dynamics Management, the four ride-height sensors are 
directly connected to the ICM control unit. 

The ICM control unit imports the analog voltage signals of the ride-height sensors. These 
are converted into the actual ride-level heights in millimeters. To perform this conversion, 
the ICM control unit must be able to map the voltage signals it receives to reference val¬ 
ues as otherwise it will not be able to determine the actual ride-level heights. These ref¬ 
erence values are determined by means of a synchronization procedure. 

The harmonized ride-level heights are made available by the ICM control unit as bus sig¬ 
nals. They are imported from: 

• the Vertical Dynamics Management system for the Vertical Dynamics Control and 
Active Roll Stabilization and also from the 

• footwell module for the headlight-range adjustment function. 

The ride-level heights are not transmitted as bus signals for the purposes of electronic 
ride-height control (EHC). Instead, an additional direct line connection exists between the 
ride-height sensors of the rear axle and the EHC control unit. 

The ICM control unit determines the resulting steering lock angle of the front wheels 
based on the steering wheel angle and location of the Active Steering actuator motor. 

As the rear axle can also be steered, a reliable conclusion regarding the driving dynamics 
cannot be obtained purely on the basis of the steering angle of the front wheels. This is 
why the ICM control unit also takes the steering angle of the rear wheels into account. 
The effective steering angle (of the front and rear wheels) is then determined using 
both steering angles. 

This is a purely theoretical computing value that indicates the steering lock of the vehi¬ 
cle’s front wheels that would be reguired to achieve the same vehicle motion if the rear 
axle could not be steered. The easiest way for all systems in the vehicle to evaluate the 
data on the steering wheel movement is to use this effective steering angle.

The signals from the sensors are processed before being made available in the vehicle 
via the FlexRay bus system. Specific examples of this have already been referred to 
above. To formulate this in more general terms, the ICM control unit uses all available 
sensor signals and several computing models to improve the guality of the signals provid¬ 
ed. This means that they contain fewer errors and therefore allow the signal “users” (e.g. 
the dynamic driving systems) to operate with a greater degree of precision. 

A new aspect of the F01/F02 is that the signals are not available to just a few systems in 
the vehicle. 

In the F01/F02, the signals provided by the ICM are not used exclusively by the dynamic 
driving systems. The drive control units, driver assistance systems, information systems 
and body electrical system share the signals, instead of recording or preparing these sep¬ 
arately. 

Note: This has a distinct advantage when it comes to the diagnosis of signal 
faults: Faults in all signals described here are stored centrally in the 
fault memory of the ICM control unit. 

In previous vehicles, it was possible for one signal fault to produce a large number of 
branches in the test schedule trees. The ICM architecture in the F01/F02 means that the 
test schedule can guickly pinpoint the ICM control unit in the event of a signal fault. 

The test schedule then shows the effective repair measure in each case. 


27 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 








































Higher-level Driving Dynamics Control 

Observation of the Driving Condition 

The Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) control unit calculates the current driving 
situation from the signals listed below. This essentially means the longitudinal and lateral 
dynamic driving condition. 

• Wheel speed signals from all four wheels 

• Longitudinal acceleration 

• Lateral acceleration 

• Yaw rate 

The ICM control unit therefore knows how the vehicle is actually moving at this point. 

To be able to optimize the vehicle behavior, the dynamic driving systems reguire informa¬ 
tion about how the driver wishes the vehicle to move. The driver’s command is deter¬ 
mined from the following signals: 

• Accelerator pedal angle and current engine torgue and gear ratio 

• Application of the brake pedal and current brake pressure 

• Effective steering angle and steering-angle speed. 

The driving condition and driver’s command are provided both internally and externally by 
the ICM control unit. The central driving dynamics control acts as a receiver internally in 
the ICM control unit. The control units of the dynamic driving systems (e.g. DSC) are the 
external receivers. They receive the driving condition and the driver’s command from the 
ICM control unit via the FlexRay bus system. 

Central Driving Dynamics Control 

The aim of the interventions by the dynamic driving system is to improve agility and 
traction. If reguired, they can of course also restore the stability of the vehicle. In previous 
vehicles, separate systems existed that were designed to do this and although they in fact 
communicated with each other, they tended to have a more restricted range of tasks. 

The interaction of all systems that ultimately determines the overall driving characteristics 
was therefore difficult to coordinate. 

The Integrated Chassis Management of the F01/F02 incorporates the central driving 
dynamics control. This compares the command given by the driver with the actual move¬ 
ment of the vehicle at that point and therefore determines whether intervention of the 
dynamic driving system is reguired, and also the extent of the intervention. 

The yawing force is an output variable of the central driving dynamics control system. 

This produces a rotation of the vehicle that is superimposed on the existing movement 
of the vehicle. 


28 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 



This can be used to “readjust” the driving characteristics if the result identified does not 
match the driver’s command. Classic examples of this are understeering or oversteering 
driving characteristics. 

A new feature of the ICM installed in the F01 / F02, however, is that the dynamic driving 
systems are already deliberately activated before a deviation of this nature is identified. 
The interventions of the dynamic driving systems therefore take place long before the 
driving characteristics become unstable. 

This produces a far more harmonious effect in the vehicle than would be possible from a 
conventional chassis design. The vehicle reacts neutrally in many more situations and 
does not even begin to understeer or oversteer. This new function is possible through the 
use of extremely precise computing models and new control strategies that can be used 
to evaluate and influence the driving characteristics.

Coordinated Intervention by the Dynamic Driving Systems 

The following intervention options for producing the yawing force calculated by the cen¬ 
tral driving dynamics control system have been available up till now (and will of course 
remain available) -the corresponding dynamic driving systems are shown in brackets: 

• Individual activation of the wheel brake (DSC) 

• Adjustment of the current engine torgue (ASC+T, DSC, MSR) 

• Adjustment of the steering angle of the front wheels, regardless of the driver’s input 
(Active Steering).

The option of influencing the lateral dynamics of the vehicle - the rear axle slip angle con¬ 
trol (HSR) - was available for the first time in the F01/F02. The customer only receives this 
innovative dynamic driving system in combination with the established Active Steering 
feature. This option is referred to as “Integral Active Steering”. 

A function referred to as “Actuator coordination” follows the central driving dynamics con¬ 
trol. This decides which dynamic driving system should be used to produce the yawing 
force in the specific road situation. 

For example, if the vehicle has a tendency to sharply understeer this can be counteracted 
by means of selective braking intervention at the back wheel on the inside of the curve. If 
the vehicle is eguipped with Integral Active Steering, the same objective can be achieved 
more harmoniously by applying an appropriate steering angle at the rear axle. 


31 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 

























As both actuating options are limited, it may also be beneficial to apply both at once. 

If understeering is avoided the driver becomes aware of this due to the considerable 
increase in agility. 

The F01/F02 is the first instance where genuine functional networking between the inte¬ 
grated chassis management and Vertical Dynamics Management functions also takes 
place. This does not simply mean that the ICM records and processes ride-height infor¬ 
mation and then delivers it to the VDM. 

The ICM also actively controls the Active Roll Stabilization as an integral part of central 
driving dynamics control in order to influence the self-steering characteristics. As the 
conventional chassis design already demonstrates, a more rigid anti-roll bar on one axle 
means that the overall achievable cornering stability on the same axle is lower. The effects 
of more or less rigid anti-roll bars can be emulated with the aid of the hydraulic motors in 
the anti-roll bars of the Dynamic Drive. This means that the central driving dynamics con¬ 
trol of the ICM can selectively influence the degree of available lateral force on one axle 
via the active anti-roll bars of Dynamic Drive. 

If the vehicle is currently oversteering, the cornering force at the rear axle is insufficient. 
The roll stabilizing torque at the rear axle tends to reduce in this case. This loss of torque 
is compensated for by additional cornering stability at the rear axle which helps stabilize 
the vehicle. 

The activity of the central driving dynamics control in the ICM control unit is summarized 
in the input/output graphic on the following page.

control units follows using Integral Active Steering as an example.

The Integrated Chassis Management (ICM) is the control unit that performs the calcula¬ 
tions for higher-level driving dynamics functions of the Integral Active Steering. 

The Integrated Chassis Management uses the current driving situation and the driver’s 
directional input to calculate the individual setpoint values for the variable steering-trans¬ 
mission ratio and the Yaw-Rate Control Plus. Once these have been prioritized, the ICM 
produces a reference value for the AS and HSR control unit respectively. This is a refer¬ 
ence angle that should be set at the front or rear wheels. 

The AS control unit receives this reference value and has the principal task of controlling 
the actuating elements in order to achieve the reference value. The AS control unit is 
therefore purely an actuator control unit. The same applies for the HSR control unit: this 
is also an actuator control unit. As with the AS control unit, this control unit is purely 
responsible for implementing the reference steering angle reguested by the ICM. 

This type of task distribution was implemented for the first time with the introduction of 
the ICM in the E71. The expansions in the F01/F02 mean that 

• the ICM now controls all longitudinal and lateral dynamics systems centrally (AS, 
HSR and also DSC) and that 

• ICM is the master control unit both in the linear range and also in unstable driving 
conditions.

However, the interface between the Integrated Chassis Management and Dynamic 
Stability Control is a special case.

The Dynamic Stability Control also has its own internal driving dynamics controller that 
normally implements the reference value (reference yawing force) sent from the ICM con¬ 
trol unit in the F01/F02. This is achieved through braking intervention at individual wheels 
and also by influencing the input torque. 

The DSC driving dynamics controller is also able to detect an unstable road situation 
itself using corresponding signals on the driving condition provided by the ICM in which 
case the stabilizing braking or engine interventions are implemented automatically by 
DSC. Corresponding feedback is of course also sent to the ICM. In this case, the inter¬ 
ventions of the driving dynamics control in the ICM are cancelled. 

Control and Adjustment of Steering 

The Servotronic function in the F01/F02 is included in the basic steering and Integral 
Active Steering (option). This speed-dependent power steering assistance function is 
implemented by the Servotronic valve at the steering gear. 

The Servotronic valve is always activated from the ICM control unit irrespective of the 
equipment specification. It follows that the ICM control unit also incorporates the logic of 
the Servotronic function. 

Again, regardless of the options fitted, the steering system also contains a proportional 
valve that is also controlled by the ICM control unit. The volumetric flow in the steering 
hydraulic circuit can be adjusted electronically assisted by this valve which is why it is also 
referred to as an “electronic volumetric flow adjustment” valve, or EVV valve for short. 

This valve is also controlled by the ICM control unit. The volumetric flow generated by 
the power steering pump is distributed between a circuit to the steering valve and a 
bypass circuit according to the level of power steering assistance required. This distribu¬ 
tion is infinitely variable. The less power steering assistance is required, the more 
hydraulic oil is diverted to the bypass circuit. Because the hydraulic oil in the bypass cir¬ 
cuit has no task to perform, this means that the power steering pump consumes less 
power. In this way, the EVV valve contributes to reducing fuel consumption and C0 2 
emissions.

Driver Assistance Functions 

Depending on the equipment specification, two driver assistance functions that act on 
the longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle can be integrated in the ICM control unit: 

• Cruise control with braking function (Dynamic Cruise Control, DCC) and 

• Active cruise control with stop & go function (ACC Stop&Go). 


38 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 

















The Adaptive Brake Assistant function is included in the same equipment package as 
ACC Stop&Go. 

The ACC Stop&Go function has been integrated into the ICM control unit in the 
F01/F02. This dispenses with the need for a separate LDM control unit. The DCC 
function that is calculated in the Dynamic Stability Control in the E70, for example, has 
been accommodated in the ICM control unit of the F01/F02.

The ICM control unit performs an additional important function for the Lane Departure 
Warning and Active Blind Spot Detection driver assistance systems. As both sys¬ 
tems warn the driver via a vibration in the steering wheel, a coordinator function is 
required. This is integrated in the ICM control unit. 

The ICM control unit generates a reference value for the vibration based on the warning 
requirements for the lane departure warning (KAFAS control unit) and the lane change 
warning (SWW sensor). The amplitude of the vibration varies depending on what 
triggered the warning. 

The reference value is transmitted to the steering column switching cluster via the 
FlexRay bus system then put into effect via the steering wheel module (LRE) or the vibra¬ 
tion actuator in the steering wheel.

Driving Dynamics Control 


History 

Control elements are already installed in a number of BMW vehicles that the driver can 
use to switch individual systems to a sporting mode. This includes the sports setting of 
the automatic selector lever. In this case, only the shift characteristics of the automatic 
gearbox are influenced. 

The system behaves in a similar manner when the SPORT button for the Electronic 
Damping Control or Vertical Dynamics Control (shown below) is used. This only changes 
the characteristic (hardness) of the shock absorber.

All other drive and dynamic driving systems therefore be found as it would need to 
remain in their basic setting. A suitable harmonize the damping action in both sporting 
compromise for this basic setting must mode and standard mode. 


A SPORT button that influences several systems was introduced for the first time in the 
E85/E86. The corresponding “driving dynamics control” function effects a changeover 
between a standard mode and a sporting mode in the steering, automatic gearbox and 
accelerator pedal. This meant it was now possible to coordinate these three systems far 
more effectively in both modes with the result that the customer now experiences a car 
that is uncompromisingly tailored to “Sport” in every sense.

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 
















The new driving dynamics control in the F01/ F02 contains two groundbreaking new 
features when compared to the E85/E86: 

1. All drive and dynamic driving systems installed in the vehicle are comprehensively 
switched over. 

2. Four settings are available. The status of the Dynamic Stability Control is also taken 
into account thus ensuring that two additional settings are possible. 

The driving dynamics control is operated via a new driving dynamics switch and the DTC 
button positioned directly in front of it. 

The changeover operations for many drive and driving dynamics functions are therefore 
bundled in the driving dynamics control of the F01/F02. The vehicle as a whole then 
behaves as the driver would expect in accordance with his/her chosen setting. 

This bundling can make the handling characteristics of the vehicle considerably more 
distinctive and less compromising. 

Conversely, many individual, and also sometimes meaningless, combinations are avoided 
(example: sports steering combined with comfort-oriented damping).

The driver operates the driving dynamics control using the driving dynamics switch and 
the DTC button. The ICM control unit imports the control signals then determines on the 
basis of this which new mode the driving dynamics control should adopt. The mode thus 
determined is transmitted to the relevant drive and dynamic driving systems for imple¬ 
mentation. These are: 

• The engine control system for the accelerator pedal characteristic. 

• The electronic gearbox control for driving programs and shift speed. 

• The Vertical Dynamics Management system for the Vertical Dynamics Control 
and Active Roll Stabilization. 

• The Dynamic Stability Control. 

• The ICM control unit itself that controls the power steering assistance (Servotronic) 
and the steering-transmission ratio (Active Steering). 

The ICM control unit also prompts the display of the relevant mode in the instrument 
cluster and also in the Central Information Display. In addition to selecting a mode, the 
driver can use the controller to make further settings. 

Operation and display 

The driver can select the four main modes using the driving dynamics switch. These 
main modes are designated as follows: 

• Comfort 

• Normal 

• Sport 

• Sport+ 

Afterthe vehicle is started, the driving dynamics control is always in “Normal” mode. 
When the driving dynamics switch is moved to the “Sport” position, the driving dynamics 
control initially changes to “Sport” mode and then to “Sport+” mode if this button is 
pressed again. If the driver moves the driving dynamics switch to the “Comfort” position, 
the mode changes in the opposite direction, i.e. from “Sport” to “Normal” mode. 

The DTC button provides the driver with two additional modes: 

• Traction 

• DSC off 


46 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 



The “Traction” mode can be activated by briefly pressing the DTC button. This works 
irrespective of which driving dynamics control mode was previously active. “DSC off” is 
activated by holding the DTC button pressed for longer. The “Traction” and “DSC off” 
modes can be switched off by pressing the DTC button again. The driving dynamics con¬ 
trol subseguently returns to “Normal” mode. If the driver instead presses one of the two 
rocker switches at the driving dynamics switch to deactivate the “Traction” or “DSC off” 
modes, the driving dynamics control subseguently enters “Sport” or “Comfort” mode 
(depending on which rocker switch is pressed). 

Each time the driving dynamics switch or DTC button is pressed this immediately 
prompts a reaction in the instrument cluster display. The changeover to “Sport” mode 
is shown below.

After some time, unless the driving 
dynamics switch is pressed, a more com¬ 
pact version of the display for the driving

The two modes “Traction” and “DSC off” 
present a special case in terms of their dis- Traction display mode 
play requirements. In addition to the text 
entry, the yellow DSC indicator and

Note: New symbols are now used for the yellow DSC indicator and warning 
lamp and the DTC button. The new DSC symbols used for the first time 
in the F01/F02 replace the symbols previously used. 



DSC and DTC symbolic representation 


Two different symbols were formerly used for the two states “DTC mode” and “DSC off” 
and were displayed in the instrument cluster. Since the launch of the F01/F02, only one 
symbol has been used for both states. 

The new symbols are being gradually introduced in all newly developed vehicles. The 
reason for this are changes to legislation that reguire automobile manufacturers to pro¬ 
duce a uniform display format. 

This legislation also specifies that the text message “off” must be displayed as soon as 
the DSC function is restricted, as is the case in the “Traction” and “Sport+” modes. 


49 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 





When the DTC button or the driving dynamics switch is pressed, an assistance window 
appears at the same time as the instrument cluster display in the Central Information 
Display. The name of the newly selected mode appears there together with an explana¬ 
tory text. 


In the “Sport” mode the driver also has the option of configuring this. Assisted by the 
controller, the driver can choose whether to apply the “Sport” mode to the drive systems, 
or the dynamic driving systems or both.

Modes and their effects 

This chapter describes the effects of the individual modes in the drive and dynamic dri¬ 
ving systems. As the individual systems are switched over together in a coordinated man¬ 
ner, this lends coherence to the overall behavior of the vehicle. This of course also means 
that meaningless combinations, such as a sports accelerator pedal characteristic com¬ 
bined with a highly comfort-oriented automatic gearbox shift program, are avoided and 
meaningful combinations for the mode are integrated instead. 

This is why when compared to earlier vehicles, the configuration of individual systems 
can to a great extent now be uncompromisingly tailored to one mode. The driver there¬ 
fore not only experiences coherent vehicle response characteristics in all modes, he/she 
will also sense the differences between the individual modes far more acutely. 

The table below demonstrates this, particularly through the comparison between the 
“Normal” and “Sport” modes.

The configuration shown here in “Sport” mode applies for both drive and dynamic driving systems. 


If the “Comfort” and “Normal” modes are compared instead, it is evident that the configu¬ 
ration differs in one dynamic driving system only: the Vertical Dynamics Control. This 
characteristic of the “Comfort” mode does not happen by chance and takes several 
peripheral factors into account: 

• Most drive and dynamic driving systems ensure that driving is sufficiently comfort¬ 
able in the “Normal” configuration; this is something that BMW 7 Series customers 
would expect. The Servotronic already offers requirement-based power steering 
assistance with maximum comfort, for example. 


51 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 






• The “Normal” configuration does not necessarily mean adherence to a single, 
defined system characteristic. The shift program of the automatic gearbox is only 
one example of how the current driving condition and driver’s command are taken 
into account in order to bring the behavior of the relevant system into line with these 
reguirements. 

• Most drivers relate a desire for greater comfort with the suspension and damping 
characteristics. This reguirement is particularly relevant when driving on poor or 
uneven roads. 

This means that the “Comfort” mode also embraces the philosophy of driving dynamics 
control which is to achieve a coherent vehicle response characteristic that meets the 
expectations of the driver. 

The “Sport” and “Sport+” modes also differ in terms of the coordination of one specific 
dynamic driving system: the Dynamic Stability Control. In the “Sport” mode, a decidedly 
sports-oriented overall vehicle behavior is available to the driver. 

Although it is assumed that many drivers would like to use this “Sport” mode, the DSC 
remains in normal operating mode and stabilizes the vehicle in a timely manner as 
reguired. The familiar intervention thresholds (slip, sideslip angle) that the driver has 
become accustomed to in the “Comfort” and “Normal” modes remain unchanged. This 
ensures that less proficient drivers are not taken by surprise when the DTC subseguently 
intervenes in the sportier DTC mode. 

Only once a proficient driver deliberately selects the second sports mode “Sport+” will 
gentle drifts also become available due to the higher wheel slip and sideslip angle. 

The two additional modes that the driver can select using the DTC button produce the 
effects on the drive and dynamic driving systems shown below.

The "Traction" mode is similar to the familiar DTC mode of the DSC in former BMW 
vehicles. All other drive and dynamic driving systems remain in their normal configuration 
which makes its main application clear: the purpose of "Traction" mode is to improve 
traction, e.g. when driving off on a loose subsurface. Sports driving takes a background 
role instead as the "Sport+" and "Sport" modes are available for this. 

The stabilizing DSC interventions are switched off in the "DSC off" mode. Only the brak¬ 
ing interventions that support traction are performed i.e. Electronic Differential Lock 
Control. 

In this case, most other drive and dynamic driving systems are in the sports configuration. 
This means that the aim of "DSC off" mode is to support pure driving; a direct bond 
between the driver, vehicle and road. 

Although initially it may seem astonishing that the accelerator pedal characteristic remains 
in the normal configuration in both "Traction" and "DSC off" modes, this setting is delib¬ 
erate. When driving off on a loose subsurface and also when driving in a highly sports-ori- 
ented manner with the DSC switched off, it is especially important that the driver can 
apply engine torque extremely sensitively. This is much easier to do using a normal 
rather than a more sports-oriented accelerator pedal characteristic. 

The sports-oriented accelerator pedal characteristic translates the accelerator pedal angle 
into a higher torque requirement at the engine. This torque requirement is then also put 
into effect more quickly by the engine control system. 

As a result, the driver perceives the response characteristics of the drive, and therefore 
the vehicle, as more sports-oriented. However, the driver cannot use this to apply engine 
torque sensitively.

System Components 


ICM Control Unit 

Only the system components that are linked to the new architecture of the dynamic dri¬ 
ving systems in the F01/F02 are described in this Product Information. In essence, this 
is the new ICM control unit and the periphery equipment directly connected to this con¬ 
trol unit. 

Three other Product Information packages are available in which descriptions of the sys¬ 
tem components for the individual dynamic driving systems are provided: 

• Longitudinal dynamics systems 

• Lateral dynamics systems 

• Vertical dynamics systems 

Design of the Two Control Unit Versions 

An ICM control unit is installed in every F01/ F02. Each ICM control unit contains the 
following, irrespective of the equipment installed in the vehicle: 

• Two microprocessors 

• A FlexRay controller 

• Output stages for activating valves in the steering system 

• Integrated sensor system for driving dynamics variables (previously: DSC sensor) 

The essential tasks of one of the microprocessors are the calculation of control func¬ 
tions, communication processing and activation of the output stages. The main task of 
the second processor is to monitor safety-relevant functions and bring about a system 
shut down in the event of a fault. 

The other components of the ICM control unit listed above are described in the follow¬ 
ing chapters. 

Two versions of the ICM control unit exist. The version installed in the vehicle depends 
on the equipment. 

If the vehicle is equipped with one or both of the following options 

• Integral Active Steering (IAL, SA 2VH) or 

• Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function, 

the high-performance version of the ICM control unit is installed. 

If neither of these options are installed in the vehicle, the basic version of the ICM control 
unit is used. The two versions of the ICM control unit are differentiated externally by their 
part numbers. 


54 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 




The internal layout of the high-performance version differs from the internal layout of the 
basic version in the following ways: 

• Larger microprocessor (required to calculate the Integral Active Steering control and 
active speed control) 

• Redundant sensor system for lateral acceleration and yaw rate (safety requirement 
for Integral Active Steering). 

The following graphics make these differences clear.

Integrated sensor system 

The sensors that were previously accommodated separately in the DSC sensor are now 
installed in the ICM control unit. 


The ICM control unit uses these sensors to calculate variables that provide key informa¬ 
tion on the vehicle’s dynamic state: 

• Longitudinal acceleration and pitch of the vehicle in the longitudinal direction 

• Lateral acceleration and pitch of the vehicle in the lateral direction 

• Yaw rate.

All sensors integrated into the ICM control unit are known as micromechanical sensors. 
By applying this principle, the dimensions of these sensors can be reduced to the extent 
that they can be accommodated in housings that are similar in size to microprocessor 
housings. The sensors are of course designed on the basis of prevailing stresses in the 
vehicle (thermal, mechanical). However, when servicing the vehicle, the ICM control unit 
must be handled with the same degree of care as the familiar DSC sensor. 

Note: The ICM control unit must not be exposed to strong vibrations. The inte¬ 
grated sensor system will be destroyed if the housing is struck by hard 
objects, or if the control unit is dropped. The control unit must not be 
installed in the vehicle in this case. 


57 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 






















The longitudinal and lateral acceleration sensors operate according to the capacitive 
principle. They consist of two electrodes, that mesh in a comb-like form. One of the elec¬ 
trodes has a unidirectional moving bearing which means that if a force acts on the sensor, 
the electrode is displaced. This changes the gap between the two electrodes and in turn 
changes the capacitance which is calculated back to the size of the force applied by 
means of evaluating circuits. 

Instead of recording the acceleration directly, the sensors record it indirectly by measur¬ 
ing the force on the sensor element. The force applied may have several causes and the 
sensor cannot differentiate between these: 

• Inclination of the vehicle or road (e.g. gradient accelerating force) 

• Change in speed (drive or braking force) 

• Cornering (centrifugal force).

In the graphic two longitudinal forces are shown acting on the vehicle: a motive force and 
a gradient accelerating force. These forces are produced due to the inclination of the 
road. As a result, a force acts on the vehicle and can be calculated as follows: 

^resulting ~ ^1 - F 2 


58 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 










Only the resulting force can be measured by the sensor. The measured force is 
processed in the control unit. The change in road speed is taken into account. 

The actual acceleration of the vehicle and the gradient of the road are the only calculation 
results provided. 

A similar calculating process is used for the lateral direction. The calculation results 
produced in this case are the lateral tilt and lateral acceleration of the vehicle. 

The sensor that determines the yaw rate also employs the principle of force measure¬ 
ment, a principle also used by the acceleration sensors. The yaw rate sensor measures 
the force that acts on a sensor element oscillating across the direction of rotation. 

The sensor signals are initially referenced to the sensor housing. However, in order to be 
useful to the dynamic driving systems, these variables must be referenced to the vehicle 
coordinate system. The ICM control unit performs the necessary conversion. 

A synchronization process is carried out when the ICM control unit is started up during 
which corresponding correction values are determined and saved. 

Note: Calibration of the sensors integrated into the ICM control unit is 
necessary in the following cases 

• the ICM control unit has been replaced or 

• if requested by the test schedule in the diagnostic 
system due to a fault code memory entry. 

The calibration must be performed with the vehicle standing on a level 
surface in the longitudinal and lateral direction. Terminal 15 must also 
be switched on.

bus systems are connected.

Installation location of the ICM control unit overview 


Installation Location 

The ICM control unit is installed in the center console behind the sensor for the crash 
safety module. This means that the position of the control unit and its integrated sensor 
system in the vehicle, near to its center of gravity is ideal from the point of view of driving 
dynamics. The mounting points on the body are precisely determined and are measured 
when the vehicle is manufactured and must not be replaced with any other mounting 
points. 

The housing of the control unit is connected to the metal body of the transmission tunnel 
with four screws and spacer sleeves made of aluminum. The control unit must be mount¬ 
ed on the vehicle body free of play as otherwise vibrations may be induced in the control 
unit housing which would severely impair the operation of the integrated sensor system. 

A secondary task of this mounting is to conduct heat away from the control unit to the 
body.

For the mounting to be able to perform these tasks, the following points must be

Note: Only screws and spacer sleeves that are in perfect condition may be 
used. Deformed or damaged fixing elements must not be used. 

The mounting screws in the reamed holes must be tightened first, fol¬ 
lowed by the other two screws. The tightening torque specified in the 
repair instructions must be observed without fail. 

A check must then be carried out to make sure the control unit is mount¬ 
ed securely and free of play. 

To ensure sufficient heat dissipation and to avoid vibrations, the sides 
and top of the control unit housing must not come into contact with 
other vehicle components. Instead, the spaces provided around the 
control unit as part of the engineering design must always remain free of 
other components.

Replacement and Start-up 

Removing and installing the ICM control unit 

The ICM control unit performs tasks that are important for many vehicle functions, e.g. 
provision of sensor signals. If the vehicle were operated without the ICM control unit 
installed, a large number of vehicle functions would not be available. In the area of dynam¬ 
ic driving systems, for example, the Servotronic and stabilization functions would no 
longer be available. In addition, fault code memory entries would inevitably also be gener¬ 
ated in many control units. 

Note: If the ICM control unit needs to be replaced, the repair instructions must 
be observed without fail. 

For example, the vehicle battery must be disconnected before removing 
the control unit and reconnected following the installation. This is the 
only way to ensure synchronized restarting of the control unit assembly. 

Note: Once the new ICM control unit has been installed, it must be started up 
with the assistance of the diagnostic system. To do this, the following 
steps must be carried out (depending on the equipment specification): 

• Calibration of the sensors integrated into the ICM 

• Calibration of the ride-height sensors 

• Initialization of the Integral Active Steering. 

Calibration of the sensors integrated into the ICM 

The signals from the acceleration and yaw rate sensors integrated into the ICM are refer¬ 
enced to their housing. However, in order to be useful to the dynamic driving systems, 
these variables must be referenced to the vehicle coordinate system. In order for the ICM 
control unit to be able to carry out the necessary conversion, it reguires corresponding 
correction values. These are determined during the one-off calibration procedure and 
stored in the ICM control unit. 

Note: The instructions of the diagnostic system must be followed precisely 

during calibration of the sensors integrated into the ICM. It is particular¬ 
ly important for the vehicle to be standing on a surface that is level in 
both the longitudinal and lateral directions. If this is not the case, incor¬ 
rect correction values will be determined that may cause the dynamic 
driving system to malfunction. 


63 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 



Calibration of the ride-height sensors 

The measurement signals from the ride-height sensors are evaluated by means of volt¬ 
age measurement in the ICM control unit. The ICM control unit cannot calculate the actu¬ 
al ride-level heights in millimeters on the basis of this information alone. To perform this 
calculation, the ICM control unit must be able to map the voltage signals it receives to ref¬ 
erence values. This is the only way to establish a relationship between the measurement 
signals and the actual ride-level heights at the wheels. These reference values are deter¬ 
mined during a synchronization procedure. 

Note: The ride-height signals in the ICM must be synchronized in the following 
cases 

• following replacement of the ICM control unit, 

• following replacement of a ride-height sensor or 

• if prompted to do so by the test schedule of the diagnostic system 
(due to a fault code memory entry in the ICM). 

The synchronization does not have to be carried out if a wheel has 
been changed. 

Note: The following points must be observed in order to perform the synchro¬ 
nization using the diagnostic system 

• the air suspension control operations must be blocked (remove fuse 
for EHC control unit) 

• the ride-level heights must be measured using a tape measure and 

• the rim size must be determined. 


The diagnostic system also refers to the ride-level height reference values (design posi¬ 
tion). These values are used by the diagnostic system and ICM to calculate the reference 
values for the conversion that are ultimately saved in the ICM control unit. 

The ride-height signals in the EHC control unit (if installed) and the ride-height signals in 
the ICM control unit must be synchronized together. 


64 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 



Initialization of the Integral Active Steering 

The ICM control unit calculates the higher-level control functions for the Integral Active 
Steering. The output signals of this control function are the reference steering angles, 
that should be set at the front and rear axle. 

This is performed by the AS and HSR actuator control units together with the actuators. 
The actual angle set at the front and rear axle is sent to the ICM control unit as acknowl¬ 
edgement. The control circuit of the driving dynamics control system closes once this 
information has been received. 

To determine this information correctly, the Integral Active Steering must be initialized. 
During this initialization procedure, the center of the steering gear at the front axle is 
determined and the corresponding signal values are stored (for example). 

Note: The Integral Active Steering must be initialized under the following cir¬ 
cumstances: 

• the ICM, AS or steering column switch cluster control unit has been 
replaced or 

• the steering angle sensor in the steering column switch cluster has 
been calibrated or 

• the steering gear has been replaced or 

• if requested by the diagnostic system due to a fault code memory 
entry in the test schedule. 

During the calibration the diagnostic system issues several prompts to steer from one 
limit position to the other. The internal combustion engine should be running and the 
vehicle should be standing on the ground of the workshop when calibration is in 
progress. These marginal conditions most closely resemble the conditions under which 
the customer operates the vehicle and deliver the best initialization results. If the front 
wheels are resting on revolving and sliding supports, or are suspended in mid air if the 
vehicle is raised, this may lead to unsatisfactory results. 


65 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 



Calibration of the steering angle sensor in the steering column switch cluster 

In addition to the signals from the motor-position sensors of the Integral Active Steering, 
the ICM control unit also imports the signal from the steering angle sensor in the steering 
column switch cluster. This is used by the ICM to determine the effective steering angle 
(see “Functions” section). 

This is why it is important that the ICM receives a correctly mapped value from the steer¬ 
ing angle sensor. 

Note: The steering angle sensor must be calibrated if the steering column 

switch cluster is replaced or reprogrammed. A calibration must also be 
performed if this is requested in the test schedule of the diagnostic sys¬ 
tem as the result of a fault code memory entry. 

The steering angle sensor must be calibrated before the ICM can calcu¬ 
late a correct effective steering angle and make this available via the bus 
system. 

Note: Once the steering angle sensor has been calibrated, the instructions of 
the diagnostic system must be precisely followed. 

The vehicle must be standing on even ground during calibration. The 
steering wheel must be in the straight-ahead position (visually). 

Start-up, short range radar sensors 

If the option “Active speed control with stop & go function” is installed in the vehicle, this 
will include the necessary radar sensors. 

Although short range radar sensors are intelligent sensors that perform the functions of a 
control unit they cannot be accessed directly via the diagnostic system. The ICM control 
unit acts as a “go-between” between the short range radar sensors and the diagnostic 
system which is why the ICM also controls the start-up process for the short range radar 
sensors. 

Note: The short range radar sensors for ACC Stop & Go must be started up if 
one (or both) short range radar sensor(s) is/are replaced. In this instance, 
the diagnostic system communicates with the ICM control unit. The ICM 
in turn controls the corresponding functions in the short range radar 
sensors. 

The installation position and, most importantly, the angle at which they are installed rela¬ 
tive to the vehicle’s longitudinal axis, are entered in the newly installed short range radar 
sensors during start-up. A measurement does not need to be carried out in this case. 

The angle entered is the angle predetermined by the construction and the form of the 
bumper support.

FlexRay 

The ICM control unit is connected to the FlexRay controller via the FlexRay bus system. 
The communication with virtually all partner control units is handled by the microproces¬ 
sors in the ICM. 

The FlexRay is routed to the ICM control unit (from the central gateway module) and con¬ 
tinues from there (to the DME/DDE). The ICM control unit is related to the FlexRay, i.e. 
not an end node. This is why it does not have a terminating resistor for the FlexRay. 

Local CAN 

A further bus system, a local CAN, is connected to the ICM control unit in addition to the 
FlexRay. This serves the ICM exclusively for the purposes of communication with the 
active speed control radar sensors. This local CAN therefore performs the same tasks as 
the sensor CAN in the E6x LCI that connects the LDM control unit to the radar sensors. It 
transmits information on road users that has been recorded by the radar sensors. 

The local CAN operates in the same way as the PT-CAN with a data transfer rate of 500 
kBit/s. There are two terminating resistors for the local CAN, each with 120 .. One of 
these is in the ICM control unit, the second is integrated in the long range radar sensor 
(LRR). The close range sensors (SRR) are routed to the local CAN via short lines. 

The pins for the local CAN are only connected at the plug of the ICM control unit if it is a 
high-performance version. 

Wake-up line 

The ICM control unit is also connected to the wake-up line. The ICM control unit can be 
woken up via the wake-up line.

Power Supply 

The only external power supply to the ICM control unit is with terminal 30B. This is made 
available by the junction box electrical system and the fuse carrier at the front. 

The electronics and integrated sensor system are therefore supplied inside the ICM 
control unit. Additionally, the ride-height sensors connected to the ICM control unit and 
the output stages for activation of the valves for the steering unit are also supplied.

Arm (pivoting) 




Design and principle of operation 

The angle of a pivoting arm is converted to a voltage signal via the ride-height sensors. 
The greater the angle (with reference to a defined starting position), the greater the out¬ 
put voltage generated by a Hall sensor element. 

Versions 

Four ride-height sensors are installed in every F01/F02 as standard equipment. 

However, the ride-height sensors installed in the vehicle are available in different versions. 
Different ride-height sensors are used on the left and right of the front axle. 

Different ride-height sensors are also used on the rear axle. The reasons for this in both 
cases are the available installation space and the starting position. 


Double or single-type ride-height sensors are used at the rear axle, depending on 
whether the vehicle is equipped with electronic ride-height control (EHC). Single-type 
ride-height sensors are always used at the front axle.

Interface with ICM control unit 

As shown in the system circuit diagram, each ride-height sensor (irrespective of the ver¬ 
sion) is connected to the ICM control unit by three lines. The double-type ride-height 
sensors at the rear axle are also connected to the EHC control unit according to the same 
principle via three additional lines. 

Power is supplied by the ICM control unit to the ride-height sensor via one of the lines. 
The sensor uses the second line to deliver its measurement signal (0-5 V DC voltage). 
The third line is connected to a common ground inside the ICM control unit. 

The measurement signal is evaluated by means of voltage measurement in the ICM con¬ 
trol unit. The ICM control unit cannot calculate the actual ride-level heights in millimeters 
on the basis of this information alone. To perform this calculation, the ICM control unit 
must be able to map the voltage signals it receives to reference values. This is the only 
way to establish a relationship between the measurement signals and the actual ride-level 
heights. These reference values are determined during a synchronization procedure. 

Note: The ride-height signals in the ICM must be synchronized in the following 
cases 

• following replacement of the ICM control unit, 

• following replacement of a ride-height sensor or 

• if prompted to do so by the test schedule of the diagnostic system 
(due to a fault code memory entry in the ICM). 

The synchronization does not have to be carried out if a wheel has been 
changed.

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 








The new driving dynamics switch consists of two buttons labeled “COMFORT” and 
“SPORT”. This is a rocker switch that returns automatically to the center position after it 
is pressed. The center position corresponds to the “no button pressed” status. 

Both buttons of the driving dynamics driving switch are connected directly to the ICM 
control unit via two lines. The ICM control unit applies a voltage at these lines. Both but¬ 
tons are connected to the ground via a resistance network. The ICM control unit can 
determine the following by back-scanning the voltage obtained: 

• whether a button has been pressed and, if so, which of the two buttons, 

• whether breaks in the wiring exist and 

• whether a short to ground has occurred. 

In previous vehicles, the familiar DTC button is connected electrically, e.g. to the IHKA 
control unit (E70/E71). In the F01/F02 on the other hand, the DTC button is connected to 
the ICM control unit via an electrical wire. A voltage is applied to this wire by the ICM con¬ 
trol unit. The DTC button connects to the ground. The ICM control unit can determine by 
means of voltage measurement whether the DTC button is operated. 

The “Driving dynamics control” function in the ICM control unit evaluates the operation of 
the driving dynamics switch and DTC button and uses this as the basis for determining 
the corresponding mode (see “Functions” section). The ICM control unit sends signals 
via the bus system to inform the driver at the instrument cluster which mode has been 
set. 

The footwell module supplies power to the center console operator control unit via termi¬ 
nal 58g for the locating lamp.

Valves of Steering Unit 

The proportional valve that adjusts the electronic flow (EVV valve) and the Servotronic 
valve is activated directly from the ICM control unit. The ICM control unit contains the 
necessary output stages that are built up using power semiconductors. 

Each valve is connected by two lines to the ICM control unit. The ICM control unit calcu¬ 
lates the reference values for the aperture of both valves based on the road speed, steer¬ 
ing angle and steering-angle speed input signals. These reference values are converted 
to a pulse-width-modulated signal that is applied at the lines leading to the valves. This 
means that the ICM control unit can change the aperture of the valves at anytime.

Service Information 


What Points must be Observed During Servicing 

ICM Control Unit 

Note: If the ICM control unit needs to be replaced, the repair instructions must 
be observed without fail. 

For example, the vehicle battery must be disconnected before removing 
the control unit and reconnected following the installation. This is the 
only way to ensure synchronized restarting of the control unit assembly. 

Note: The ICM control unit must not be exposed to strong vibrations. The 

integrated sensor system will be destroyed if the housing is struck by 
hard objects, or if the control unit is dropped. The control unit must not 
be installed in the vehicle in this case. 

Note: Only screws and spacer sleeves that are in perfect condition may be 
used to mount the ICM control unit. Deformed or damaged fixing ele¬ 
ments must not be used. 

The mounting screws in the reamed holes must be tightened first, fol¬ 
lowed by the other two screws. The tightening torque specified in the 
repair instructions must be observed without fail. 

A check must then be carried out to make sure the control unit is 
mounted securely and free of play. 

Note: Once the new ICM control unit has been installed, it must be started up 
with the assistance of the diagnostic system. To do this, the following 
steps must be carried out (depending on the equipment specification): 

• Calibration of the sensors integrated into the ICM 

• Calibration of the ride-height sensors 

• Initialization of the Integral Active Steering. 


75 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 




Diagnosis in the Event of Signal Faults 

Note: The ICM control unit itself contains sensors that provide the following 
signals: 

- longitudinal acceleration 

- lateral acceleration 

- yaw rate. 

The wheel-speed signals are recorded and made available by the DSC 
control unit. The steering wheel angle is determined by the steering 
angle sensor in the steering column switch cluster. 

The ICM control unit processes all the sensor signals and makes these 
available in the form of bus signals to other systems in the vehicle. 

If fault code memory entries for these signals exist, the following proce¬ 
dure is recommended when working through the test schedules: 

Start with the test schedule for the control unit that is providing the sig¬ 
nals. The most important signal sources for dynamic driving systems are 
the ICM, DSC and steering column switch cluster. You will be able to get 
to the root of the fault and eliminate it more quickly using this procedure. 

Instead, the test schedules for the control units that receive these sig¬ 
nals only contain references to the transmitter control units which 
means they do not lead directly to the ultimate cause/solution of the 
fault. 

Sensors in the ICM 

Note: Calibration of the sensors integrated into the ICM control unit is neces¬ 
sary in the following cases 

• the ICM control unit has been replaced or 

• if requested by the test schedule in the diagnostic system due to a 
fault code memory entry. 

The calibration must be performed with the vehicle standing on a level 
surface in the longitudinal and lateral direction. Terminal 15 must also be 
switched on. 


76 

F01 Dynamic Driving Systems 



Note: The instructions of the diagnostic system must be followed precisely 

during calibration of the sensors integrated into the ICM. It is particular¬ 
ly important for the vehicle to be standing on a surface that is level in 
both the longitudinal and lateral directions. 

If this is not the case, incorrect correction values will be determined that 
may cause the dynamic driving system to malfunction. 

Ride-height Sensors 

Note: The ride-height signals in the ICM must be synchronized in the following 
cases: 

• following replacement of the ICM control unit, 

• following replacement of a ride-height sensor or 

• if prompted to do so by the test schedule of the diagnostic system 
(due to a fault code memory entry in the ICM). 

The synchronization does not have to be carried out if a wheel has been 
changed. 

Note: The following points must be observed in order to perform the synchro¬ 
nization using the diagnostic system 

• the air suspension control operations must be blocked (remove fuse 
for EHC control unit) 

• the ride-level heights must be measured using a tape measure and 

• the rim size must be determined. 

The diagnostic system also refers to the ride-level height reference val¬ 
ues (design position). 

These values are used by the diagnostic system and ICM to calculate the 
reference values for the conversion that are ultimately saved in the ICM 
control unit. 

The ride-height signals in the EHC control unit (if installed) and the ride- 
height signals in the ICM control unit must be synchronized together.

Steering Column Switch Cluster with Ssteering Angle Sensor 

Note: The steering angle sensor must be calibrated if the steering column 

switch cluster is replaced or reprogrammed. A calibration must also be 
performed if this is requested in the test schedule of the diagnostic sys¬ 
tem as the result of a fault code memory entry. 

The steering angle sensor must be calibrated before the ICM can calcu¬ 
late a correct effective steering angle and make this available via the bus 
system. 

Note: Once the steering angle sensor has been calibrated, the instructions of 
the diagnostic system must be precisely followed. The vehicle must be 
standing on even ground during calibration. The steering wheel must be

Integral Active Steering 

Note: The Integral Active Steering must be initialized under the following cir¬ 
cumstances 

• the ICM, AS or steering column switch cluster control unit has been 
replaced or 

• the steering angle sensor in the steering 1 column switch cluster 
has been calibrated or 

• the steering gear has been replaced or 

• if requested by the diagnostic system due to a fault code memory 
entry in the test schedule.

lamp and the DTC button. The new DSC symbols used for the first time 
in the F01/F02 replace the symbols previously used.
