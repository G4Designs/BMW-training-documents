System Overview 


Schematic System Circuit Diagram - Interior Lighting 

The system circuit diagram follows the description below and provides an overview of 
the full extent of all possible interior lighting options. 

The status of the door contact (Hall sensor) in the lock (38) changes, for example, when 
the door is opened with the vehicle unlocked. The footwell module (1) evaluates the sta¬ 
tus and sends the reguest to switch on the interior lighting. 

At the same time, the doorway light (13) for the door that is open and the footwell lights 
(2, 3, 46, 48) are switched on by the footwell module. The status of the door contact 
changes again when the vehicle door is closed. The footwell module initiates the proce¬ 
dure to switch off the interior lighting. If the tailgate is opened, the status of the tailgate 
switch (21) registered by the tailgate central locking module changes. The luggage com¬ 
partment lighting (24, 53) is connected to the power supply via Terminal 30B so that the 
luggage compartment lights are switched on via the tailgate switch.

Functions 


Important Control Units in the Interior Lighting System 

The interior lighting on the F01/F02 is switched on and off by the footwell module 
(FRM). 

The roof function center (FZD) is responsible for the interior lighting components in the 
passenger compartment roof. 

The paragraphs that follow now describe the interior lighting functions in more detail. 

Footwell Module 

The footwell module is the central control unit for the interior lighting system. All interior 
lighting outputs of the footwell module are pulse-modulated. This ensures the interior 
lighting functions at a constant brightness level in the event of voltage fluctuations. The 
pulse width modulation is additionally used for the soft ON/soft OFF function. 

The footwell module features the following functions for the interior lighting: 

• Switching the interior lighting on/off 

• Electric load shut-down after 8 minutes 

• Lighting via terminal 58g. 

Switching on the interior lighting 

The footwell module receives numerous input signals that switch on the interior lighting. 
The input signals are read directly by the footwell module or are received via the K- 
CAN2. The input signals for the interior lighting are listed in the following.

Switching-on conditions 

If any of the following conditions for switching on the interior lighting is met, the interior 
lighting is switched on. The switch-on function is limited in terms of time. The electrical 
loads are: 

• Unlock via barrel lock in driver’s door 

• Vehicle unlocked using ID transmitter 

• Terminal 15 OFF if Terminal 58g was ON no more than 2 min previously 

• Lock button on ID transmitter pressed after the central locking has been in double- 
locked status for longer than 10 seconds. 

The interior lighting remains permanently switched on in certain situations. These situa¬ 
tions are: 

• Receiving crash signal 

• Interior lighting button briefly pressed. 

Note: Pressing the interior lighting button again switches it off. 

Switching off interior lighting 

The footwell module receives numerous signals to switch off the interior lighting. Those 
signals are received via the K-CAN2 or are read directly by the footwell module. 

Switch-off conditions 

The interior lighting is switched off under the following conditions: 

• Central locking in central arrest, all doors and the tailgate are closed 

• 8 min after Terminal 15 OFF (cut-out of electrical eguipment) 

• Interior lighting button pressed for longer than 3 seconds (continuous “OFF”) 

• Terminal 15 ON when doors closed 

• Terminal 58g ON and Terminal 15 OFF. The interior lighting is switched off if no door 
is opened within 20 seconds. 

• The interior lighting is switched off if the vehicle is unlocked via the ID transmitter 
and no door is opened within 20 seconds. 

• “Power down” via diagnosis. 


11 

F01 Interior Lighting 



Cut-out of electrical equipment 

As of Terminal 15 OFF, the interior lighting is switched off by the footwell module after 8 
min. For that purpose, the footwell module broadcasts the electrical equipment cut-out 
instruction via the K-CAN2. 

The roof functions center FZD receives this information and switches off the interior light¬ 
ing in the roof area. 

The interior lights that are switched on directly by the footwell module are also switched 
off. 

Terminal 58g 

The footwell module supplies the Terminal 58g signal via the K-CAN2 or conventional 
wiring. Terminal 58g is pulse width-modulated and features the following two brightness 
levels: 

• The brightness level for the locator lighting is individually adjustable using the thumb 
wheel on the lights operating unit. 

• The brightness level for the function lighting is not dimmed and is switched on at full 
brightness. 

Hazard warning switch 

As soon as the hazard warning switch is pressed, the footwell module switches on the 
switch lighting at full brightness. 

Note: The hazard warning switch is not illuminated at full brightness level at 
terminal 58g. The brightness depends on the setting of the locator 
lighting. 


12 

F01 Interior Lighting 



Roof Function Center 

The roof function center (FZD) incorporates the front interior light unit. 

The FZD is the link to the interior light unit in the rear passenger-compartment roof. 

Interior lighting functions 

The interior lighting functions in the roof functions center are: 

• Loop-through of power supply provided by the footwell module, e.g. IB and 
Terminal 58g 

• Reading of signals from rear reading light buttons 

• Power supply to vanity mirror lights or reading lights in the rear interior light unit. 

Reading of signals from rear reading light buttons 

The roof function center reads the signals from the rear reading light buttons. A flip-flop 
circuit is used for the purpose for each rear reading light button. Pressing the reading light 
button changes the status of the flip-flop circuit. The change of status causes the roof 
function center to switch the reading light concerned on or off accordingly. 

The footwell module supplies the Terminal VA status signal. The rear reading lights are 
among the devices switched off by the electrical equipment cut-out function. 

Luggage Compartment Lighting 

The luggage compartment lighting is connected directly to Terminal 30B. 

The luggage compartment lighting is functional as of status Terminal 30B ON and fused 
in the rear power distribution box. 

When the tailgate is opened, the status of the tailgate switch changes. This means the 
luggage compartment lights are connected to ground and therefore switched on. 

The status of the tailgate switch changes when the tailgate is closed again. The ground 
connection is interrupted and the luggage compartment lighting switched off. 

Glove Compartment Lighting 

The light is connected to Terminal 30B in the front power distribution box and protected 
against short circuits by a fuse. 

When the glove compartment is opened, the glove compartment switch closes. 

As a result, the glove compartment lighting is connected to ground. 

The glove compartment lighting is switched off by closing the glove compartment. 


13 

F01 Interior Lighting 



Car Access System 

The Car Access System supplies the central vehicle has been locking status signal via 
the K-CAN2. In this way, the footwell module recognizes when the unlocked and conse- 
guently switches on the interior lighting. 

Courtesy Lighting 

The courtesy lighting operates in sync with the interior lighting. That means that the cour¬ 
tesy lighting remains switched on as long as the interior lighting is on. 

Note: Previously, the courtesy lighting was limited to 20 seconds. This func¬ 
tional feature on the F01/F02 is a change from other BMW models.

System Components 


Interior Lighting, Front 

The components for the interior lighting in the front roof area are integrated in the roof 
functions center and in the sun visors. The footwell lighting is located on the underside 
of the dashboard. 

Interior Lighting in the Roof Function Center 

The interior light unit on the F01/F02 is integrated in the roof function center. 

The interior light unit consists of: 

• Reading light with button for driver and front passenger 

• Interior light with button 

• Ambient interior light for driver and front passenger. 

The roof function center is matched to the color of the roof lining. 

Various equipment options make it necessary to install additional components in the 
roof functions center. 

If a panoramic glass roof is installed, the roof functions center contains not only the but¬ 
ton for the panoramic glass but also the necessary control and monitoring facilities. 

The ultrasonic interior movement detector is completely integrated in the roof function 
center on vehicles equipped with an anti-theft alarm system. 

The rood function center simply loops through the signals for all other components. 
This means the components are connected directly to their respective control units. 

These components are: 

• Emergency call button 

• Passenger airbag OFF lamp. 

Interior Light Unit, Rear 

The rear interior light unit incorporates the following lights: 

• Reading light with button for left and right rear passengers 

• Interior light with button 

• Ambient interior light for driver and front passenger.
