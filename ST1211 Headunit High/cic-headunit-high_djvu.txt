1. Introduction 

1.1. Headunit history 

Although the E65 (7 Series) introduced the iDrive concept it wasn't until the launch on the E63 (6 
Series) in 2003 that the first headunit was introduced at BMW under the name Car Communication 
Computer (CCC). This device combined the tuner functions (radio), navigation, speech processing, 
a user interface and a DVD/CD drive in one component (for the first time in a BMW vehicle). For this 
reason this central control unit was referred to as the headunit. With the launch of the F01 (in the fall of 
2008) the 2nd generation Fleadunit High the Car Information Computer (CIC) was introduced. 

CIC was a completely revised control concept with one of the highlights being an integrated hard 
drive, on which both the map data for the navigation and a music collection with relevant music track 

database (Gracenote ), were stored. Numerous external receivers (IBOC, SDARS) were also gradually 
incorporated into the headunit hardware. BMW Assist and BMW Online were supplemented with 
Google Search and displayed in the menu BMW Services or ConnectedDrive (from 03/2011). The 
Active Voice Recognition was further developed and supplemented with a one-shot destination input.

1.2. 3rd Generation Headunit High 

The 3rd generation of the Headunit High introduced in July 2012 is part of the model upgrade for the 
7-Series Life Cycle Impulse (LCI) as well as for the 5-Series sedan and Gran Turismo. The Headunit 
High will also be installed in the F30 hybrid and F31 as from their market launch. 


1.3. New features 

The CIC user interface has been completely revised and upgraded with a futuristic (3D effect) 
enhanced perspective view. The structure of the individual menus is now shown in virtual high 
resolution with enhanced graphics. The symbols on the symbol bars have been standardized and 
a variety of movements and animations have also been added. Images of vehicles and objects 
(previously only visible in the Options menu) have now been integrated directly in the submenus for a 
more sophisticated and ultra modern look and feel.

The hardware was completely revised and is now equipped with a new 1.3 GHz processor, 1 GB 
working memory, 8 GB flash memory and a 200 GB SATA hard disk. And as with the earlier 
headunits, the flash memory and hard disk cannot be replaced. 


The music collection has been enhanced and equipped with new functions (e.g. favorites). 


The USB interface in the center console can now play video files, as well as audio files. It is also 
used for importing/exporting data and updating navigation maps, as the USB in the glove compartment 
has been discontinued. 


New to the IBOC is the display of album art and station logos (these are only displayed if the station 
provides such content over the HD digital signal) 

With regard to telephone/connectivity, the main telephone and additional telephone are now 
handled equally for the first time and shown together in the Office menu. The Combox media 
was integrated in the headunit complete with all functions and interfaces. In addition, the headunit- 
supported telephone service (SA6NH) was integrated and has made redundant the use of the Combox 
media. 


The Combox with telematics functions has been replaced with its successor, the Telematic 
Communication Box (TCB). 

The Rear Seat Entertainment system (RSE) was completely revised and equipped with new 
hardware (RSE control unit and new rear monitors) with new functions like zoning, serving function. 
But the big addition to RSE would be the ability to use Navigation and set destinations from the 
rear seat. F01 vehicles with the ZRP option (Rear Entertainment Package) will have the controller 
integrated into the center armrest of the backseat while the other vehicles will use a wireless remote 
control. 


The Headunit High is equipped with a message dictation "Speech-to-text" function to answer and 
compose text messages and emails directly via the Drive and the use of a BMW “Tested” phone. A 
Voice memo function is also available where voice memos can be recorded , saved to a USB or sent 
via email as sound files.

1. Introduction 

1.4. Glossary 

1.4.1. Streaming 

The process of data transfer for audio or video files is called "streaming", "livestream" or in brief 
"stream". The data in this case is transmitted via radio. The significant difference to the radio is that 
there the transmitted data can be received from a variety of receivers. In the case of streaming a point- 
by-point connection between the media server of the sender and the receiver is realized for each user 
as per his requirements, etc. In this regard the complete file does not have to be sent to the receiver 
to start playback. Playback can take place for the receiver as soon as the transmission has started. 
Examples for streaming include the Bluetooth audio streaming. 

1.4.2. Codec 

Codec (made-up word from English co derand dec Oder) is a procedure, which codes and decodes 
data or signals using digital means. Video or audio files are not changed during coding without any 
loss, but a dynamic reduction of the signal, as well as data compression, are performed, which result in 
deteriorations in quality depending on the extent and procedure. An example of this is the conversion 
of a CD digital audio file .wav to a compressed audio file .mp3. Video files can also be converted. An 
example of this is a .mov file converted using XviD Video codec to MPEG-4 video format. 

Due to the decline in quality (which is generally not noticeable for the user) we can reduce the 
necessary bandwidth or the required memory capacity (example .wav 70MB to .mp3 approx. 7MB). 

Furthermore, it is important to make a distinction between the coded data format, i.e. the audio and 
video format, and the container format. 

1.4.3. Container 

A container or container format is a file in digital data processing which can contain different files and 
file types. 

Audio/Video container formats can contain at least one audio and video stream. Some formats also 
allow embedding of subtitles, menu structures or other content. A container format is thus only the 
cover for the files contained therein. A mpeg-4 container, for example a H.264 coded video, can be 
combined with a AAC audio or a Xvid coded video combined with MP3 audio. Containers are a basic 
requirement for video files, music also exists in a "raw" version, i.e. without the noise of containers. 

The content of a container is not visible from the outside.

Partitioning 

The hard disk in the Car Information Computer had a storage capacity of 80 GB. This was increased 
to 200 GB in the 3rd generation of the Headunit High. While navigation and contact details and 
the Gracenote database have retained the standard capacity as in the CIC, other areas have been 
expanded. For example the memory capacity for the music collection was increased by more than 8 
GB to 20.5 GB. The interactive Owner's Manual (IBA) was expanded from 0.5 GB to 4 GB. The speech 
input system "iSpeech" (voice recognition) was also increased from 0.5 GB to 1.7 GB. With a reserve 
of 100 GB the storage capacity is more than sufficient even after several updates to the navigation 
data.

To protect sensitive customer data such as "Address details" and "Settings" for example, a 
permanently integrated flash memory was installed in the Headunit High. The data is much more 
protected against external influences here than on a hard disk. The integrated flash memory is 
permanently installed and cannot be individually replaced or updated.

Power supply for CID via Headunit High 


The central information display (CID) has no separate bus connection in conjunction with the Headunit 
High. The CID is directly connected to the headunit via an APIX data line. APIX (Automotive Pixel Link) 
is a bit-serial data transfer system with a data transfer rate of 1 Gbit/s on just one copper core pair. 

Each APIX data channel also has a bidirectional reverse channel. This reverse channel is used for 
transmitting status information (e.g. operating temperature of the CID), diagnosis information and 
control signals. 

Data transfer via the APIX data line has been optimized with regard to electromagnetic compatibility 
and power consumption. Because of the CID's low power consumption, the CID can be supplied 
with power via two separate current lines directly by the Headunit High, and there is no need for a 
separate power supply to the CID. The two copper core pairs and the two power supply leads are 
connected by a common connector to the headunit and the CID. Because of the high data transfer rate 
with low electromagnetic emissions, it is also possible to use copper wiring for applications with a high 
bandwidth requirement and to dispense with fiber optic networking. 


4.3. External devices 


4.3.1. AUX-IN connection with USB interface 

With the use of the Headunit High, the USB interface in the glove box is discontinued. 

Otherwise, the Headunit High USB audio/video interface and customer data import/export is always 
housed at the center console. 

There will thus only be one USB interface in the vehicle, available in the switchable versions (for 
vehicles with USB base plate) or non-switchable for vehicles without USB base plate. This connection 
is then used both to play external media and for data import/export such as navigation data for 
example. 

Video files 

With the new Headunit High for the first time it is possible to send video files using a memory medium 
(USB stick) to the headunit and play them there. Video and audio files are combined here in the 
container and sent as a digital signal via USB. 

A container file or a container is a file in digital data processing which can contain different files and file 
types. For details see Chapter 1.4. Some formats also allow embedding of subtitles, menu structures 
or other content, etc. 

The following video files are supported:

4.3.2. Smartphone connection 

If the SA6NL is selected as telephone optional equipment, the connected SA6NF “Media interface 
for Smartphones" for BMW vehicles is generally installed with a video base plate. The vehicles are 
thus prepared for videos. Only the CVBS line to the headunit and the corresponding software are 
missing. 

CVBS line and software can also be ordered by the customer with the SA6NR "Apps". In addition to 
the USB connection of applications for the Smartphone (Apps), a video interface and the iPod remote 
control function, called "plug-in" is also installed in the vehicle (under the ConnectedDrive menu). 


4.4. Telephone systems 

For the telephone systems of the Headunit High the optional equipment SA6NH — Hands-free 
Bluetooth and USB audio connection and the SA6NL Bluetooth and USB devices with BMW Assist 
are used. 


4.4.1. Telephone-supported headunit 

With the introduction of the Headunit High it is now also possible to support the "telephone-supported 
headunit" (Inbox). This is available as standard in the BMW 5-Series, 6-Series and 7-Series, X5 and 
X6. This function is also activated in BMW 1 -Series, 3-Series and X3 (F25) vehicles with the order of a 
Headunit High (SA609 navigation), as SA6NH - hands-free system with USB interface is included 
automatically. 

The SA6NH Hands-free Bluetooth and USB audio connection includes a basic hands-free system 
(without cell phone charger base plate) and without external antenna, i.e. For the customer this means 
simple implementation of a hands-free system through a Bluetooth connection for cell phone and 
vehicle. 

Subsequent comparison of the SA6NH versions with Headunit Basic, CIC Basic 2, CIC and Headunit 
High. Installation of the slim-design version of the telephone control unit Combox Media with 
reduced range of functions as an interface is no longer required for the Headunit High. This is made 
possible through an antenna output for the Bluetooth antenna, as well as an integrated module for the 
Bluetooth connection with the customer cell phone.

For the Headunit High in conjunction with the SA6NH for Apple media player (iPod , iPod Touch , 
iPhone ) no Y-cable can be used. The so-called "One-Wire technology" in conjunction with the white 

standard Apple USB cable is required here to connect the Apple media player to the vehicle via the 
USB interface in the center console. The former Combox features: Bluetooth audio streaming, Office, 
album cover and software update continue to remain deactivated for SA6NH. The customer needs to 
order SA6NL for this. 

A 

It is important to note that “not all hardware configurations are available in all markets” and 
that available options way vary within the different BMW model series vehicles. 


4.4.2. Telephone connection with snap-in adapter 

Option SA6NK connection for Bluetooth and USB devices is offered in many markets as a further 
expansion stage to the SA6NH. In addition to a hands-free system, a base plate for a snap-in adapter 
is also installed. This base plate has a charger for the cell phone and a connection for the external 
antenna. 


41 



















Headunit High 
4. System Components 


The following functions are also available: 

• Bluetooth audio streaming 

• Office functions with calendar, reminders, notes 

• Album cover for audio files 

The functions are moved to the headunit with the 3rd generation Headunit High and the additional use 
of Combox multimedia (Media) is no longer required. 

4.4.3. Telematic Communication Box (TCB) 

The Telematic Communication Box (TCB) is a permanently installed speech and data modem for 
the Headunit High. The transmission standard of the TCB is specified in the HSPA standard with 
14.4 mbit/s. The customer receives a TCB when the SA6NL connection for Bluetooth and USB 
devices with BMW Assist is ordered. As most interfaces and functions of Combox are moved to 
the Headunit High (hands-free function, USB interfaces, speech processing, Bluetooth audio, Office, 
contacts etc.). 

The TCB is required for the following functions: 

• BMW Assist with eCall (emergency-call function) 

• BMW Online 

• Remote functions (reception and controller) 

• "Speech-to-Text" function in Office feature 

• BMW TeleServices via P-SIM 

The TCB is always connected to two cell phone antennas. The roof antenna is for the telematics 
functions of the vehicle. The second antenna should function as an emergency-call antenna in the 
event of a rollover. The emergency-call function involves sending the data package, as well as setting 
up a voice contact from the vehicle to the emergency call center. 

The TCB is prepared and equipped with an additional battery pack in order to guarantee functions 
independent of the vehicle electrical system. Thus in the future even in the event of an accident with 
a loss of the vehicle electrical system (destruction of battery, power distribution box or wiring) an 
emergency call can still be placed.

Digital Signal Processor (DSP) 


Vehicles with Headunit High are equipped with phase diversity. The radio signals of the two FM 
antennas are amplified and transmitted to the Headunit High. The power supply for the antenna 
amplifier is made available by the Headunit High. The radio signals are digitized in the Headunit 
High. An improved signal is then calculated from the two radio signals with the aid of an algorithm 
in a digital signal processor (DSP). For updating the list of stations only the signal of one antenna is 
used temporarily for the radio reception. The signal of the two antennas is required for scanning the 
frequencies. The interval for updating the list of stations depends on the signal quality of the stronger 
antenna, but occurs at the latest every four minutes. 


46 




































Headunit High 
4. System Components 

4.5.2. Intermediate frequency in the AM range 

For the AM range there is a variable ZF bandwidth in the Headunit High which is dependent on the 
reception strength. The usual bandwidth of approx. 7 kHz is restricted for a weak signal to 2.4 kHz. The 
resulting effect is comparable to turning back the treble control. 

The reduction of the high frequencies was previously done via the so-called High Cut. Here a 
frequency reduction is only performed on the audio side. With the variable AM-ZF bandwidth one 
achieves a comparable acoustic effect, but at the same time a significant improvement in the channel 
separation. 

An "interfering transmitter" which can be received on a neighboring channel is better suppressed to 
30 dB (factor 30). On AM this is important at nighttime. 

4.5.3. Bluetooth antenna 

Since the introduction of the 5-Series Gran Turismo the Bluetooth antenna was incorporated into the 
wiring harness. With this design a disconnected antenna can no longer be identified by diagnosis. 

With the use of the Headunit High diagnosis-compatible antennas are now once again used for 
BMW vehicles. Here the connector is resistance-coded, i.e. a disconnected antenna is immediately 
recognized by the diagnosis system. For large series vehicles the Bluetooth antenna is located in the 
rear of the center console (branch rear outlet channel, rear left). 


4.5.4. SDARS and IBOC (US) 

For the US market SDARS or the digital radio IBOC tuner module are located in the tuner module for 
the satellite radio inside the Headunit High. This was already the case with the introduction of the Car 
Information Computer (CIC). More information on the connections for SDARS and IBOC is available in 
Chapter 4.1.3. 

The SDARS antenna is integrated in the roof antenna. The IBOC HD radio system uses the side bands 
of the FM frequency band and thus the FM antenna. In this connection, phase diversity in the FM 
range has a positive influence on the reception of digital HD radio signals. 


4.6. Rear seat entertainment system 

4.6.1. System overview 

Two rear seat entertainment systems with a separate RSE control unit are offered in conjunction with 
the Headunit High for 5-Series, 6-Series Gran Coupe and 7-Series vehicles. A distinction is made here 
between the rear seat entertainment system SA6FH (high version with radio remote control) and 
Rear-seat entertainment Professional SA6FR (high version with controller). For vehicles in the 5- 
Series the Rear-seat entertainment Professional version is not offered with a controller (SA6FR).

The big addition to RSE would be the ability to use Navigation and set destinations from the rear 
seat. Another new feature in comparison to the rear seat entertainment system introduced in the 
F01 is the RSE control unit with USB interface in the front. In comparison to the predecessor RSE 
control unit, the second AUX In input (audio right and left, video) is discontinued. The new RSE control 
unit includes two radio interfaces for the connection of two wireless headphones. These replace the 
infrared system of the previous RSE system. The same RSE control unit is used for the two rear seat 
entertainment system versions.

The CD/DVD drive supports a variety of media just like its predecessor (for details see F01/F02 rear 

seat entertainment systems training material available on TIS and ICP). The Gracenote database 
function is active when playing CD digital audio in the RSE control unit drive as well as when playing 
in via the Fleadunit High drive. However, due to space restrictions no album cover is displayed when 
playing. This is reserved exclusively for the Headunit High and the central information display at the 
front of the vehicle. 

Track information and album covers of CD digital audio files from the DVD changer are not shown in 
the rear seat entertainment system. The reason for this is that the rear seat entertainment system 

does not request information from the Gracenote database in the Headunit High when playing music 
files from the DVD changer.

4.7.1. Radio remote control 

The radio remote control of the rear seat entertainment system sends the signals along a transmission 
path via the remote control receiver FBD to the vehicle. For vehicles in the 5-Series and 7-Series this 
is done via the FBD receiver in the rear window. In the new 3-Series and 6-Series vehicles the FBM 
receiver is installed as a module near the left C-pillar. The other signal shape agrees with the vehicles 
in the 5-Series and 7-Series.

Headphones for the radio transmission 

The headphones for the previous system used infrared technology, this has now been changed over 
to radio transmission. With the radio transmission via Kleer protocol a high-end radio transmission in 
the range of 2.4 GHz was selected, which supports 14 channels. In contrast to traditional Bluetooth 
protocols, the Kleer protocol ensures uncompromised (loss-free) sound reproduction on the 
headphones. For details see Chapter 5.8.3. The voltage supply is guaranteed via three typical AAA 
batteries.

5. Functions 

The "Functions" module presents new features of the 3rd generation Headunit High in comparison to 
the 2nd generation Headunit High (Car Information Computer). A full description of the functions can 
be found in the Owner's Manual of the respective vehicle. 


5.1. Display and operating concept 

5.1.1. Changes to the predecessor 

The display and operating concept of the new 3rd generation Headunit High includes a significant 
further development of the 2nd generation Headunit High (CIC). The menu structure in main menus 
and submenus was retained for the most part whereby many functions of the option menus have 
moved directly to the submenu. The digital graphics were enhanced significantly with 3D effect logos 
and the "opening" of individual menus.

5.2.2. Music collection 

Saving media 

The music collection on the hard disk was increased from 12.5 GB to 20.5 GB. The customer now has 
the option of saving approx. 5,700 music items instead of 3,500 music items in the form of a aac music 
files (rip function) with a bit rate of 192 kbit/sec. 

If the customer plays the music collection as a backup on a USB stick, the music files are 
encrypted, .aac file thus cannot be found.

Saving a CD audio in the music collection 

It is also possible to import music files from a USB stick. For this a USB stick is inserted in the import/ 
export USB interface of the vehicle (for details see Media interfaces in Chapter 4.3.1). Then the 
process can be started in the option menu of the vehicle. 

Via file import, copied music files from a USB stick or CD are placed one by one as .mp3, .wma or .aac 
in the same file format on the hard disk.

Headunit High 

5. Functions 


Gracenote® 

The Gracenote database on the hard disk, which adds meta files to the music files, was divided up 
according to country for the Headunit High. There are therefore the following regional databases on 
the hard disk: 

• Europe 

• Rest of the World 

• North America 

• Japan 

• China/Korea 

Thanks to this regional division it was possible to establish further features. The Gracenote database 
now adds track information and album covers when playing CD digital audio. During the import 
process (ripping) i.e. the changeover of a CD digital audio to a compressed .aac music file, in addition 

to track information, album covers are now added by Gracenote to the music collection. 

Update for Gracenote® 

The latest Gracenote database is made available to the dealer organization 1 -2 times a year with 
the media package. The update process remains the same in comparison to the CIC. It is done via 
the service menu. For details on this please refer to the " F01/F02 Audio Systems" training material 
available on TIS and ICR The update is also possible via the BMW programming system because the 

Gracenote database was updated on the ISIS. 

Operation 

To make the menu items clearer for the customer the symbols have been standardized. This means 
the same symbols are always used, no matter whether one is in the menu "External audio sources" or 
"Music collection".

The Headunit High in the audio and video area also functions as a audio and video player by means 
of external sources, in addition to playback of broadcasting sources (radio) and the music collection 
stored on the hard drive. On the one hand via wired connection from a Smartphone or USB stick. On 
the other hand by means of streaming sources such as Bluetooth. 

USB stick 

USB storage media as external audio players have been supported since the ULF-SBX-High (E70). 

The connection for the interface for the Headunit High is now no longer connected via a separate 
interface box (ULF-SBX High or Combox). It is connected directly to the headunit. This means that 
AUX-ln connection with USB socket is always connected directly in the Headunit High. 

Music track 

If USB media are connected to the Headunit High via the USB interface, the headunit saves the track 
information of these USB media. The track information of up to four USB sticks or up to about 40,000 
tracks can be saved in the vehicle in this way. If a fifth device is connected or more than 40,000 tracks 
stored, the information from existing tracks is deleted. 

Video streaming 

With the introduction of the Headunit High there is the option to play video files in different container 
formats (see 4.3.1) in the headunit and to display them on the CID. The video image is shown on the 
front control display and only when the parking brake is activated or in gear position P. The sound track 
of the video file can only be played if no audio medium (e.g. MP3 player) is connected via the jack plug 
of the AUX-IN connection.

File systems 

Popular file systems for USB devices are supported for the data import/music player function. The FAT 
32 and NTFS formats are recommended. 

A 

The following systems are not supported for data import: MTP, Devices (iPhone , iPod , etc.) and 
HFS formatted USB sticks; The data backup/data export of the music collection (backup) is not 
supported on USB devices with NTFS partitioning! 

Recovery (backup) of a music collection from the CIC to the Headunit High is not possible 
with these devices! 


USB 3.0 is currently not yet supported. However, USB 3.0 end devices are downward compatible and 
thus compatible with the USB 2.0 socket installed in the vehicle. The maximum speed is then reduced 
to the USB 2.0 standard. 

Smartphone 

Audio and video files can be played with appropriate telephone equipment (telephone optional 
equipment with the SA6NF connection for Smartphone) via the Headunit High. It is important to 
ensure that the proper snap-in adapter is used. For example for the Headunit High in conjunction with 

the iPhone 4S only the "Media" snap-in adapter or "Media with fan" can be used. 

External streaming sources 

In the "Settings" menu under the "Connections" submenu the different streaming media can be 
connected.

The Bluetooth audio streaming introduced with the Combox, a Bluetooth audio connection between a 
cell phone and end device, was fully integrated into the Headunit High. 

As with CIC the standard audio video remote control profile AVRCP 1.3 is used for the introduction 
of the Headunit High. This means that the metadata such as artist, album, track, etc. can still be 
displayed. "Browsing" will only become available with version 1.4 (AVRCP 1.4 is planned for later in 
production as an enhancement to the current version).

The new Navigation has the ability to display icons for POI Brands and weather information. 

The Points of Interest (POI) icons are currently limited to fuel stations (icon of brand) and BMW 
Centers (shows BMW Roundel). 



These icons are available from map scales 40 ft - 1 mile. As the user zooms into or out of the map, the 
icons will be automatically adjusted to include as many as possible, but without cluttering the screen. 

Users can also view weather information icons in the map overview. 

This feature is standard with Navigation system and not tied to any BMW Assist Plan. 


70

These icons are available from map scales 10 miles - 250 miles. As the user zooms into or out of 
the map, the icons will be automatically adjusted to include as many cities as possible but without 
cluttering the screen. This feature is only available as part of the BMW Assist Safety Plan. 

5.4.4. Advanced Real-Time Traffic Information (ARTTI) 

The Advanced Real-Time Traffic Information (ARTTI) of BMW ConnectedDrive developed for 
BMW navigation systems increases reliability and precision in the creation, communication and 
use of real time traffic situations for the purpose of route computation and appropriate diversion 
recommendations. 

Advanced Real-Time Traffic Information (ARTTI) is different from Real Time Traffic Information (RTTI). 
ARTTI is available exclusively with BMW's newest navigation system (available on selected 2013 
Model Year or later vehicles) while RTTI has been available since as far back as 2006. 

ARTTI is a further development of the previous traffic information system (from ConnectedDrive), RTTI 
Real-Time Traffic Information. The most important advantages of ARTTI over the RTTI are quicker 
and more comprehensive data transfer via mobile radio and the SIM card integrated in the vehicle in 
the TCB control unit. As well as covering highways, the new system also includes national roads and 
numerous inner city connections. 

ARTTI is only available on vehicles equipped with Navigation system (SA 609) and in combination with 
optional equipment BMW Assist (SA612) and a valid ConnectedDrive contract (Safety Plan). 

In addition to the information sources used by RTTI in the determination of traffic situations (traffic 
messages from the police and traffic jam sensors), movement profiles of cell phones made anonymous 
and the data from traffic control systems are taken into consideration in ARTTI. The movement profiles 
are determined with the aid of specific road users (e.g. truck fleets, taxis, etc.) whose navigation 
systems are linked to a control center. The traffic data are made available about two minutes after the 
headunit is started. ARTTI is updated every 3 minutes to ensure that customers always get the latest 
traffic information and, when the navigation’s dynamic guidance feature is turned on, the system will 
offer routes for rerouting around traffic jams of 5 minutes or longer. 

With ARTTI the traffic flow is depicted in the traffic flow map using different colors: 

• Green: flowing traffic (recommended speed limit) 

• Yellow: traffic slowing (< 50% of recommended speed limit) 

• Orange: stop and go traffic (< 25% of recommended speed limit) 

• Red: traffic jam (<12.5% of recommended speed limit)

There is no "green" color used for traffic information in RTTI, only red, orange, and yellow. 

Below please find the map which shows the traffic flow in full image format. The Traffic Info symbol can 
be found in the symbol bar. 


Diagram of traffic flow in traffic overview (Traffic Info menu) with active ARTTI 

Recommended diversion 

If disruptions occur on the computed route with a calculated delay of less than 20 minutes, the traffic 
information symbol in the symbol bar is displayed in yellow. If the delay is calculated at more than 20 
minutes or if there is a road closure, the symbol is displayed in red. If a diversion is sensible on the 
basis of the current traffic situation and the associated disruption, this is recommended to the driver. 
The extra mileage for the recommended diversion and the estimated time saving are displayed. 



72 








Headunit High 

5. Functions 


ARTTI availability for 2013 Model Year vehicles is: 

• 7 Series (standard) 

• 5 Series (optional on 528i and 535i, and standard on 550i and ActiveHybrid5) 

• 5 Series GT (optional on 535i, and standard on 550i) 

• ActiveHybrid3 (optional) only, no other 3 Series have ARTTI for 2013 

Note: All other vehicles will continue to have RTTI available. 

5.4.5. Route guidance 

ECO Pro route 

Alternative routes can be selected under the menu item "Route criteria". Here in addition to the 
"current route" an "alternative route" and an ECO PRO route are also offered. An ECO PRO route is a 
consumption-optimized route calculated by the combination of the lowest possible consumption and 
fastest routes.

For the Headunit High the update of navigation data can be done via a USB stick or DVD depending 
on the market. The reason for the different versions is that the map of Europe for example had to be 
split over three DVDs due to its size. A USB stick with corresponding capacity is practical here. The 
navigation data (map material) can also be updated via ISTA programming as with all current BMW 
vehicles.

With the introduction of the Headunit High a distinction is made between main telephone and 
additional telephone, with a few exceptions. 

• The main telephone is generally used for contacts saved in the vehicle. 

• If both telephones are connected to the vehicle at the same time, the contact details of both 
telephones are also visible in the Contacts menu (identifiable by the Bluetooth symbol behind 
the entries). The telephone to be used can be selected in the Options menu. 

• The entries in the phone book of both registered cell phones can be selected via speech input. 

• Up to 5000 contacts can be loaded from each cell phone via Bluetooth to the vehicle (i.e. a 
total of 10,000). In addition, a maximum of 1000 online contacts (from the ConnectedDrive 
portal of the customer) and 1000 contacts which can be stored on the hard disk. 


Registration and connection 

The previous submenu "Bluetooth" for registration and connection of a cell phone is now located in 
the "Settings" menu under the submenu "Connections". For details see Chapter 5.7.1. 

5.5.2. Voice input for Office 

Message Dictation 

“Message Dictation” is a feature that allows you to use “speech-to-text” to dictate emails and text 
messages. Speech is converted to text using the menu item “New” in the Office submenu. This 
done via a BMW server (also called "backend"), which sends the encrypted voice data to the service 
provider Nuance . Nuance then sends the message back as a text file to the headunit. This then

Requirements 

A prerequisite for the "Message Dictation" function is a speech input system. This is no longer 
activated via the SA620. The speech input system is connected to the telephone optional equipment 
SA6NL. In addition, the SA249 is still required for a multifunction steering wheel. 


78 






















Headunit High 

5. Functions 

The "Message Dictation" function is only available for the SA6NL. The function is an additional 
service of ConnectedDrive but requires a Convenience Plan subscription. For new vehicles with 
ConnectedDrive a 60-day trial period is enabled. Usage of this service beyond the included 60- 
day trial period requires a separate subscription with Nuance. More information is available via 
www. nuance.com/b mw. 

A cell phone is also required which is registered and connected to the vehicle. The cell phone must 
fully support the "Mail Access Profile (MAP)" Bluetooth standard. Some cell phone manufacturers 
only implement some of the MAP profile. For the launch of the Headunit High only select devices from 

RIM satisfy this standard. A valid email address must also be added and a cell phone with a valid cell 
phone contract registered and connected as the cell phone is used as a modem for this service. 

As of July 2012, the Message Dictation feature is only supported by the following devices: 

• Nokia N8 

• Blackberry 9300, 9700, 9800, 9810, 9860, 9900 

• Samsung Galaxy S2 

• HTC Sensation 

• Motorola Milestone 2 

Note: For further information regarding cell phone compatibility please refer to bmwusa.com/ 
bluetooth. 

Voice memos 

All notes from the cell phone and the notes included in the vehicle are shown in the menu item Notes 
allowing for their compatibility. The notes are then transferred from the main telephone and additional 
telephone. 

Recording and exporting a voice memo 

A spoken voice memo can be input in the vehicle using the microphone and recorded with the 
Headunit High. This voice memo (sound bite) can then be sent as an email attachment or saved in 
“Notes” as an audio file. Voice memos can also be exported via the USB port in the center console. 
This is done from the Options menu. An audio file is then stored on the USB stick in a .aac container. 

A_ 

The Message Dictation feature is not available for the iPhone®. The reason for this is that 

Apple® does not fully support BMW Office functions (Bluetooth profile does not support the 
transmission of Office data). 


5.5.3. Office calendar display 

The new headunit offers a graphic visualization of dates in the Office function similar to MS Outlook. 
The daily view and the navigation in the calendar have been simplified significantly. An exchange 
server connection is not available.

BMW TeleServices report 

The BMW TeleServices report service is not active directly for the customer, but is shown on the CID 
upon completion. Measured values from the field are collected to introduce timely measures and to 
increase customer satisfaction. With regard to data protection no geopositions or personal details are 
sent. 

The BMW TeleServices report is also used to quickly check and ensure that software measures have 
been implemented for the customer effectively. With regard to data protection no geopositions or 
personal details are sent. 

BMW TeleServices Battery Guard 

The BMW Battery Guard is an extension to BMW TeleServices where critical battery situations are 
forwarded to the dealer. If the battery voltage reaches the low startability limit this status is forwarded 
to the dealer through the TRS application, the dealer then is to contact the customer to arrange for the 
customers service visit in order to check out the state of the battery. The procedure should be handled 
in the same way any other Automatic Service Call is handled by the dealer. The purpose the system is 
to prevent a customer breakdown in the vehicle due to battery discharge/low voltage.

In the Headunit High a mechanism which can differentiate between a phony video signal possibly fed 
by the hardware retrofitting (manipulation) and an original video signal is active. If the original video 

signal for plug-in from the iPhone does not arrive within 10 seconds after activation of the plug-in in 
the headunit, a fault message appears in the CID. In this fault message the customer is notified that 
the telephone or snap-in adapter is to be connected again. The cause may be related to a possible 
contact fault on the analogue FBAS video signal line. 


5.7. Vehicle information and settings
