Byteflight Safety Systems 

Since the launch of the E65, many new innovations to passive safety systems have been 
introduced to the BMW model line. Otherthan MRS systems, there are 2 new passive 
safety systems which utilize the new byteflight fiber optic technology. 

These new systems are: 

• Intelligent Safety Integration System (ISIS) - used on the E65 and E66 

• Advanced Safety Electronics (ASE) - used on the E85, E60, E63 and E64 

The above systems, which differfrom MRS, use the new byteflight fiberoptic technolo¬ 
gy. In contrast to M RS, which uses a centrally located control module, the ISIS and ASE 
systems use byteflight to allow "decentralization" of the system electronics. 

These new systems use remotely located "satellites" to acquire crash data as well as to 
trigger system components. By moving these satellites closerto potential impact points, 
the system reaction time is shortened during a collision. 

The byteflight fiber optic network allows forthe sharing of crash data between system 
components. Fiber optics also improve reliability and increase system communication 
speed.

ISIS System Structure 


The byteflight fiber optic network utilizes a "star" structure. This arrangement consists 
of a centrally located module (SIM) with satellites arranged in a radial pattern. Each of 
the satellites can communicate with the SIM individually. 


The Safety and Information Module (SIM) con¬ 
tains transmitter/receiver modules (S/E mod¬ 
ule) for each satellite. Each satellite also con¬ 
tains a transmitter/receiver module. 

The SIM is also connected via byteflight to 
the ZGM which acts as a gateway between 
the K-CAN, PT-CAN and the D-bus. 


Example of Star Structure on the ISIS system

This structure allows the following design 

objectives to be achieved: f 

• Earlier and more precise impact detection 

• Improved occupant protection 

• High transmission speed 

• Improved system reliability 

• Fastertrigger decisions 

• Redundant sensor information 

• Software update via bus 

• No Electromagnetic interference 

• M echanical safety switch no longer 
needed 

• No electrical connection between 
transmitter and receiver module 

• Optical fibers are lighterthan copper wires 


• System can be updated/retrofitted easily 


On the ISIS system, the acceleration sensors are integrated into the satellites. The airbag 
ignition circuits forthe relevant airbag are also contained within the satellite. Each satel¬ 
lite is installed in various strategic locations throughout the vehicle. This method allows 
for de-centralization of the system electronics which results in earlier crash detection as 
well as shorter "reaction" times during impact. 


The AS E systems share the same basic structure as the ISIS system, but there are less 
satellites within the system.

ASE System Structure 

The ASE system was first introduced with the E85 and then later adapted to the E60, 
E63 and E64. 

The E85 only uses 4 satellites connected to the SIM . The E85 does not use a separate 
ZGM, but the SIM carries out some of the ZGM functions. The "ZGM" function of the 
SIM acts as a gateway between the byteflight and K-Bus. And the instrument cluster 
(kombi) is used as a gateway to the PT-CAN, K-Bus and D-bus.

In comparison to the E85, the E60 has more 
systems which requires the use of additional 
satellites. There are 6 satellites used which 
are connected to the SGM (Safety and 
Gateway Module). 

The SGM combines the functions of the 
SIM and ZGM used on the E65. It carries 
out the gateway function between byte- 
flight and the D-Bus. The SGM also per¬ 
forms some additional functions which will be 
discussed later in this training module. 

The E63 and E64 use a similar structure and 
share many of the components from the E60.

Central Gateway Module (ZGM) 

The ZGM is located in the electronics carrier 
behind the glovebox. It carries out the task of 
a gateway between the following: 

• byteflight 

• K-CAN-P 

• D-bus 

• PT-CAN (and wake-up) 

The gateway translates messages between 
bus systems and controls the flow of data to 
and from each system. The only connection 
forthe D-bus is at the ZGM. This means that 
all diagnostic communication must pass 
through the ZGM. 

The ZGM also has the ability to determine if a 
BMW diagnostic tool is connected or an after- 
market scan tool. This allows access to only 
the necessary data needed. 

A non-volatile memory is also integrated into 
the ZGM which can be used to store configu¬ 
ration, diagnostic and crash data.

SIM E65/E66 

The SIM is located in the electronics carrier 
behind the glove box and performs 3 main 
tasks: 

• The satellite power supply and reserve, if 
the powersupply should fail during an 
accident. 

• The function of the intelligent star coupler 
and the main controller for the byteflight 
bus. 

• Triggering an automatic emergency call 
by sending a signal to theTCU.

Power supply to the operational safety systems 

The SIM is supplied with voltage via terminal 30 and 31. If the on-board supply voltage is 
sufficiently high, power is fed to switching controller (8) which routes voltage to the S/E 
module (4) and switching controller (5). 

The second switching controller (7) is supplied via KL30 and controlled by the micro¬ 
processor via the SHDN 2 line. The capacitor is charged from KLR. The capacitor 
charge forms the power reserve. The charge voltage is 400 V. 

Power S upply in the event of an impact 

If the on-board voltage supply falls below approximately 8V, switching controller (7) is 
immediately operated in the opposite direction. The switching controller generates the 
voltage which replaces the supply from KL30 until the capacitor is empty orthe on-board 
voltage supply is restored. The switching controller is controlled by the microprocessor 
via the SHDN2 line. Atterminal R,the switching controller is switched off again. 

However, there is no defined discharging of the capacitor. 

C onsumer S hutdown 

Switching controller (8), which supplies the voltage to the S/E module and the satellites 
via switching controller (5), is switched to sleep mode by microprocessor (3) via the 
SHDN1 signal (shutdown) due to the off-load current. To ensure that the necessary main 
functions also continue in sleep mode, a 9.8 V linear controller (1), which is in constant 
operation, is switched in parallel with the switching controller. This voltage supplies the 
wakeable S/E modules and a downstream 5V linear controller (2). This second linear 
controller supplies the microprocessor. The wakeable S/E modules are connected to the 
satellites (SZL,ZGM), which can wake up the byteflight. The otherS/E modules are 
supplied by the switching controller (8) via switch (9) and are switched off in sleep mode.

Intelligent Distributor 

The intelligent distributor is a system which performs the following tasks: 

• Power supply for each individual satellite 

• Current limitation for each individual satellite 

• Power shutoff for each individual satellite if a fault occurs 

The SIM supplies all of the satellites centrally in order to ensure that the safety system 
functions reliably. The power must be distributed intelligently so that the system can 
continue to function smoothly if there is a short circuit or overcurrent on one of the supply 
lines. 

The distributor integrated into the SIM limits the currentto the satellites to 100 mA on 
each line. An exception is the satellite forthe steering column switch cluster, for which 
the current intake is approximately 120 mA, because the steering wheel module must 
also be supplied. If the current limit is exceeded the power supply is cut. 

It is also possible forthe microprocessor to shut off each individual distributor output and 
therefore each individual satellite. 

Intelligent Star Coupler 

The transmitter and receiver module is a component which can convert electrical signals 
into optical signals and transmit them via fiberoptic cables. Each satellite has an S/E 
module. 

The S/E modules are each connected to the star coupler in the SIM via the byteflight 
bus. There is also an S/E module for each satellite in the SIM . 



14 

byteflight safety systems 

















All of the information transmitted via the byteflight bus takes the form of messages 
which are sent as pulses of light. The S/E modules in the SIM receive the light pulses 
from the satellites that are connected to them. In the intelligent star coupler, the mes¬ 
sages are forwarded to all of the satellites. Data exchange is possible in both directions. 

The S/E modules consist of a light emitting diode (LED) and a photo diode, which are 
mounted one on top of the other using chip-on-chip technology. This means that both 
components are connected to the fiberoptic cable in the optimum way. 

The transmitter and receiver module contains the LED forthe driver switching and the 
receive amplifierforthe converting the optical signals into digital signals. Monitoring of 
the optical transfer quality is also integrated. 

The satellite is switched off if one of the following faults occurs on one of the fiberoptic 
cables: 

• No optical signal received in a defined period of time 

• A transmitting diode is sending continuous light 

• Attenuation is too high 

Message 

A data message consists of blocks of data known as bits and bytes. The basic structure 
of a message is shown in the following diagram: 


— 

L*»it - mOns 

ID | LEN | 

DO 

Dll 1 CRCH 1 CRCll 

-Bit 

A 

Start-Sequen2 

-flit Stop 


A message always starts with a start sequence, followed by an identifier byte which 
determines the priority of the message. There is a start bit before every byte and a stop 
bit after every byte. The next byte is the length of the byte, which gives the number of 
data bytes. This is followed by a maximum of 12 data bytes and then the checksum. A 
double stop bit indicates the end of the message. Each device attached to the bus can 
send messages via the byteflight between synchronization pulses. 


15 

byteflight safety systems 






















Synchronization Pulses 

The byteflight main controller in the SIM emits synchronization pulses every 250ms. 
Alarm mode is triggered by the length of the synchronization pulse. The length of a syn¬ 
chronization pulse in alarm status is approximately 2ms. In normal mode, the synchro¬ 
nization pulse is approximately 3ms.

The bus main controller must decide when to put the satellites in alarm mode using the 
available sensor information. When the bus main controller sets alarm mode, all ignition 
power circuits for the safety system are primed. 

Two separate signals must be transmitted via the byteflight in order to trigger the igni¬ 
tion output stage. The ignition power circuit high-side switch is controlled by the byte¬ 
flight alarm mode. The low-side switch is controlled by the microprocessor in the satel¬ 
lites. The triggering algorithm detects when the low-side switch must be closed using 
the transmitted message and sensor signals.

Software Reset 

The SIM can cut the power supply to individual satellites using the intelligent distributor. 
This function is used to perform a software reset. The relevant status message is used 
to monitorthe satellites. The satellite is switched off if one of the following faults is 
detected by the bus main controller: 

• Internal fault in the satellite 

• Incorrect system time 

• Status message not received 

Depending on the type of fault, the module will try to switch the satellite back on twice 
after 100 ms. If the fault is not rectified by the power-0 N reset which has been triggered 
in the satellite module, the satellite remains switched off until the next wake-up in the bus 
system. 


17 

byteflight safety systems 





























System Time 

The system time is used as a reference when storing events, such as faults orthe ignition 
of pyrotechnic actuators. This allows the events saved in different control units to be 
classified according to time. 

In the IS IS, the SIM is the bus main controller and therefore responsible for generating 
synchronization pulses. The SIM is therefore logically also the reference for system time. 

There is a common system time for all equipment attached to the bus in the ISIS. The 
system time is started by a diagnostic command when the vehicle is manufactured. This 
process can only be carried out once, it is not possible to reset the system time. 

The time resolution is 250 ms and is triggered by the synchronization pulses on the 
byteflight. This means that only actual operating time is recorded while the byteflight 
is active. The maximum time is more than 76,000 hours. 

The time is stored in the microprocessor RAM. An entry is also made in the EEPROM 
underthe following circumstances: 

• Once an Hour 

• Upon entering sleep mode 

• When the battery is disconnected 

• When the entire system is powered by the power reserve 

Synchronization of the system time 

To ensure that the system time is the same in all modules, it is essential that all of the 
equipment attached to the bus is synchronized regularly. A distinction must be made 
between synchronization in normal operating mode and the synchronization of additional 
modules which are installed in the system as new components. 

Synchronization in normal operating mode 

A system time message is sent by the SIM when the byteflight is restarted after sleep 
mode and approximately every 16 seconds during operation. 

Because the message has a relatively low priority, it may not be transmitted immediately. 
This causes an asynchronous time value between the SIM and the satellites. As the SIM 
knows the time at which the message was sent, it is possible to correct this. 

A second system time message is sent containing the correction value. 

The correct system time is the sum of the values contained in the two system time mes¬ 
sages. The control units (satellites) do not accept the system time until both system time 
messages have been received. 


18 

byteflight safety systems 



Synchronization of new modules 

New satellite modules that are installed do not have any system time. The system time is 
transferred to the module by sending the two system time messages. 

This is only possible if the system time stored in the satellite modules is less than the 
senttime. If the system time is a module is greaterthan the senttime (i.e. if the module 
has been transferred from another vehicle), the system time is not accepted and an entry 
is made in the fault memory. 

If the SIM is replaced, the system time must be re-entered. Because the system time is 
present on all satellite modules, it must be transferred from there to the SIM. This can be 
done using the diagnostic interface (DISplus/GT-1). 

The diagnostic calculator calls up the system time from all of the satellites and selects 
the largest. The diagnostic calculator adds an amount and transfers the result to the SIM 
as a system time. 

The correction amount compensates forthe delay between when the system time is read 
from the satellites and when it is entered on the SIM . This avoids error messages being 
generated by the satellites because the system time transferred by the SIM is smaller 
than that stored on the satellite. 

Also, when the system time is set, the VIN (chassis #) and the mileage are also trans¬ 
ferred to the new satellite as well. Failure to set system time will also result in the inability 
to code the new satellite. 

Self Diagnosis ofthe ISIS 

Self-diagnosis ofthe entire ISIS consists of several parts: 

• Self-diagnosis of the SIM • Pre-drive check, phase 1 

• Pre-drive check, phase 2 • Self-diagnosis in operation 

Self Diagnosis ofthe SIM 

When KLR is switched on, or on wake-up, an internal self-diagnosis ofthe SIM is carried 
out first. The following components are tested: 

• Test ofthe analog/digital converter 

• Flash test 

• RAM test 

• EEPROM test 

• Test of the watchdog reset 

If a fault occurs during one of these tests, it is recorded in the fault memory. This stops, 
the program and no communication is possible via the bus. As the instrument cluster is 
no longer receiving any signals, the airbag warning light (AWL) lights up. 


19 

byteflight safety systems 



Pre-drive Check 

When terminal R is switched on, a self-diagnosis of the overall system, the so-called pre¬ 
drive check, is carried out. During this period, the system cannot be triggered. This is 
indicated by activation of the AWL. The total duration of a fault-free pre-drive check is 
less than five seconds. The pre-drive check is divided into two phases. 

The pre-drive check does not start until the SIM has received the first control unit status 
report from all modules which it knows from coding and only if no faults have been 
reported. If it does not receive the status report from a module or if a fault is reported, the 
powerto the satellite module is switched off. Only then is the pre-drive check started. 

Pre-drive C heck, Phase 1 

In phase 1 of the pre-drive check, the ignition output stages which are controlled by the 
alarm pulse are tested, with the exception of the high-side transistor. No alarm pulse is 
generated during phase 1. The sensors are stimulated and tested. Once these tests 
have been carried out, the result is reported in the control unit status message. An OK 
message is only sent if all tests have run without any faults. If any faults have occurred 
during the pre-drive check, these are stored in fault memory. 

Pre-drive C heck, Phase 2 

In phase 2 of the pre-drive check, the alarm path from the SIM to the ignition output 
stages are tested. The SIM sends an alarm pulse, which is returned after a 30ms delay. 
Each satellite now sends a status report with an OK message to the SIM . If the alarm 
mode has not been received correctly, a fault is logged in the fault memory. This com¬ 
pletes the pre-drive check and the module can now operate in normal mode. 

Forthe control units with ignition output stages in particular, this means that the ignition 
capacitors can be charged. If all ignition capacitors are fully charged, this is reported to 
the SIM in the status report. The AWL is switched off when all the modules report full 
ignition capacitors and no fault is determined. 

Self Diagnosis in Operation 

During operation, the SIM monitors itself continually as far as possible. The contents of 
the satellite flash memory are checked using a checksum. If a fault is detected, byte- 
flight communication is stopped and the power supply from the SIM to the satellites is 
cut. 

The S/E modules allow the optical signal quality to be diagnosed. A warning signal is 
generated if the optical reception quality does not reach a certain threshold value. If this 
is the case, communication cannot function without faults. If this warning signal occurs 
during operation, an entry is logged in the fault memory. 

During operation, byteflight messages are monitored for safety-relevant information. If 
one of these messages is not received within a set time, an entry is logged in the fault 
memory. 


20 

byteflight safety systems 



The SIM and all satellites continually check the vehicle identification numbers received 
via the byteflight against the VIN's entered into the control units. If these do not match 
or if an entry is missing, the AWL is switched on. This ensures that two control units with 
potentially incorrect coding data which have been swapped between vehicles do not 
remain undiscovered. 

The mileage reading is also stored in the SIM. To create a link between system time and 
the mileage reading, the current mileage reading is stored when the system is synchro¬ 
nized. 


Airbag warning lamp and check control messages 

Various systems can display ISIS faults. 

These include indicator lamps, graphic 
symbols (pictograms) and check con¬ 
trol messages. 

The indicator lamps include the AWL 
and the seat belt indicator lamp. 




The AWL is activated in the pre-drive check and is switched on if any of the following 
system faults occur: 

• Fault in the self-diagnosis of the SIM • Communication fault in the byteflight 

• Fault during pre-drive check • VIN number is missing or incorrect 

The graphic symbols appear in the information display on the instrument cluster. 

The following symbols are possible: 

The red airbag symbol is activated if 
there is a fault in the driver/passenger 
front airbag. The yellow airbag symbol 
is activated if there are faults in the side 
or head airbags or in the belt tensioners or belt force limiters. 

The yellow service symbol is activated if there is a fault in the fuel pump. 

In addition, fault messages can also be displayed in the Check Control Module. 

The faults detected by the satellites in the control unitorthe associated peripherals are 
sent to the SIM as a status report. These messages are transferred from the SIM via the 
byteflight to the ZGM and via the K-CAN to the information display. 

Activation ofthe AWL, the graphic symbols and the Check Control messages are con¬ 
trolled by the instrument cluster on the basis ofthe data received from the SIM. 

If the safety-relevant functions in the overall system are operating correctly, the SIM trans¬ 
mits a message to the instrument cluster at regular intervals, approximately every 200ms. 

If this signal fails for longerthan 2 seconds, the information display indicates this as a fault 
in the system by illuminating the AWL.

Fault Memory 

The control unit has a fault memory in the EEPROM. The fault memory is divided into a 
primary fault memory and a shadow memory. 

Primary Fault Memory 

The primary fault memory stores all safety relevant faults, for example if individual airbag 
functions have to be deactivated. This is indicated by the AWL orthe check control 
messages. 

Shadow Memory 

The shadow memory stores faults which were detected but which have no impact on the 
operational reliability of the system. 

FaultCode Memory Entry 

Each fault detected during the self-diagnosis is stored here, but each fault code is only 
stored once. If the same fault code occurs again, the entry is updated. The control unit 
can store a maximum of 20 different fault codes. Any faults occurring beyond this are not 
stored and are lost. 

If all the possible fault code memory spaces are already occupied, any entries that might 
be present in the shadow memory are overwritten by new entries of the primary fault 
code memory. 

Erasing the Fault Memory 

The fault memory entries can either be completely or individually erased. Erasing sepa¬ 
rate faults is used for diagnostic purposes. If several faults are stored, an individual fault 
can be erased to check whetherthe fault occurs again.

byteflight safety systems 



A-pillar Satellite (SASL,SASR) 

The left and right A-pillar satellite are practical¬ 
ly the same. They are installed underthe 
A-pillartrim in the footwell area. 

Both SASL and SASR are connected to the 
SIM via byteflight. The satellite power supply 
is also from the SIM and is buffered by the 
capacitor. When the byteflight is in sleep 
mode, the satellite power supply is switched 
off by the SIM. The software reset is also 
performed by the SIM . 

The SASL/R controls and monitors the igniter 
pellets forthe knee airbag and forthe AITS 1 
forthe driver and passenger head protection. 

If equipped with the optional rear side airbag 
the AITS is also controlled and monitored by 
the SASL/R. In addition, the SASR is respon¬ 
sible forthe control and monitoring of the front 
passenger airbag. 

Sensors 

An acceleration sensorfor longitudinal acceleration and one for lateral acceleration is 
incorporated into the SASL and SASR. The sensors provide a voltage as a measured 
variable. This voltage is a measurement forthe vehicle acceleration. This voltage signal 
is filtered, magnified, converted and sent as a message. 

The strategic positioning of the acceleration sensors in the vehicle allows the direction 
and accident severity to be detected in the satellites using detected sensor data. 

The ISIS detects whetherthe accident severity and direction of impact is a head-on, side 
or rear end collision. 

The greatest possible protection forthe occupants is provided by triggering the relevant 
pyrotechnic actuators forthe accident using the stored algorithm and in conjunction with 
the seat occupancy recognition and the seat belt use detection. 

Ignition power circuit self diagnosis 

During the pre-drive check, all of the ignition power circuits are checked. If no faults 
occur during the check, the ignition capacitors are charged and the satellites are ready 
fortriggering. 

The check of the high and low side switches takes place with the ignition capacitor dis¬ 
charged. This prevents any ignition circuitfrom being triggered accidentally if a fault 
should occur. 

There is no risk of accidental deployment if any otherfaults should occur. The faults are 
indicated via the AWL and stored in the fault memory. 



24 

byteflight safety systems 


Self diagnosis in normal operation 

In normal operation, there is a permanent check of the ignition power circuits. A fault 
message is issued, but only when the fault is confirmed over a specific period of time. 

If a short circuit to ground or short to B + is detected, the corresponding ignition capacitor 
is discharged. 


In normal operation, the self diagnosis is restricted to checking the ignition power circuit 
for short to ground, short to B + and foropen circuits.

Driver/Passenger Seat Satellite (SSFA/SSBF) 

The driver and passenger seat satellites are identical. Forthis reason, only one is shown. 
The satellite is located between the seat runners. It is fitted next to the seat module in a 
plastic housing. 

The seat satellites are connected to the SIM via byteflight. The satellite power supply is 
also from the SIM and is buffered by the capacitor. When the byteflight is in sleep 
mode, the SSFA/SSBF powersupply is switched off bythe SIM which also performs the 
software reset. 

The SSFA/SSBF controls and monitors the ignition circuits ofthe belt tensioners and the 
active head restraints. The belt buckles are also monitored by a hall sensor. The hall 
sensors are identical in design and function to those used in the E38 (from 3/97). The 
seat occupancy recognition is monitored via an interface in the voltage regulator. 

Sensors 

The SSFA/SSBF contains the seat occupancy electronics. The igniter pellets are con¬ 
trolled and diagnosed by ignition IC's. The self-diagnosis ofthe ignition power circuits 
during the pre-drive check and in normal operation is the same for all satellites.

Rear Seat Satellite SSH 


The rear seat satellite is optional and part of the rearside airbag option. The SSH is 
installed under the rear seat. The SSH is connected to the SIM via byteflight. The 
satellite power supply is also from the SIM and is buffered by the capacitor. When the 
byteflight is in sleep mode, the SSH power supply is switched off by the SIM which 
also performs the software reset. The power supply to the rear seat head restraints 
remains unaffected. 



The SSH controls and monitors the ignition power circuits of the end-fitting tensioners 
and the left/right rearside airbag. The left/right seat occupancy recognition is also ana¬ 
lyzed by the SSH. The control forthe head restraint height is also integrated. With the 
option of the comfort seats, the adjustment of the headrests is via the seat module. 

Rear Headrests 

The rear head restraints are extended automatically by an electric motor if the seat occu¬ 
pancy recognition detects that the seat is occupied and terminal R is on. The head 
restraints are returned to their original position when terminal R is switched off or if the 
seat is not occupied. 

Sensors 

The igniter pellets are controlled and diagnosed by ignition IC's. The self-diagnosis of 
the ignition power circuits during the pre-drive check and in normal operation is the same 
for all satellites.

Sensors 

A pressure sensor is integrated into the front door satellite. The sensor reacts to an 
increase in pressure. If there is an impact, the space in the door is significantly reduced 
by the outer door panel being pushed inward, which causes a considerable increase in 
pressure. The relative pressure change and rise in pressure overtime are the most 
important factors forthe crash evaluation. 

The igniter pellets are controlled and diagnosed by ignition IC's. The self-diagnosis of 
the ignition power circuits during the pre-drive check and in normal operation is the same 
for all satellites.

Steering Column Switch Cluster (SZL) 

All of the components on the steering wheel and the steering column belong to the 
steering column switch cluster. The SZL is divided into two electronic modules. One of 
these electronic module is located in the steering wheel and the other is located in the 
steering column. Both units are interconnected by a spiral spring. 

The SZL is integrated into the LSE and connected to the SIM via byteflight. The satel¬ 
lite power supply is also from the SIM and is buffered by the capacitor. There is also a 
terminal 30 for supplying non-safety relevant circuit elements and a KL15 for redundancy. 
In addition there are also redundant serial data lines to the AGS and light switch cluster. 

The SZL controls and monitors the igniter pellets for the first and second stages of the 
driver's airbag. It is controlled via the spiral spring between the steering wheel and igniter 
pellets in the airbag.

Advanced Safety Electronics (ASE) 

The ASE system is a byteflightbase6 passive safety system which utilizes the same 
technology as ISIS. The system was introduced on the E85 and subsequently fitted to 
the E60, E63 and E64. 

The technology used in the ASE system offers the same benefits and advantages that 
ISIS offers. Many of the components used on ASE are carried overfrom ISIS with some 
noteable differences.

The AS E system in the E85 differs considerably from the ISIS system. Most notably 
there are fewer satellites in the system. There are only 4 satellites connected to the SIM . 
These include the STVL, STVR, SBSL and SBSR. 

There are some additions to the ASE system as well. Since the E85 is a roadsterwith no 
back seat, a switch for airbag deactivation has been added to allow the installation of a 
front child seat if needed (up to 9/2003). The switch, which is actuated using the vehicle 
key, will deactivate the passengerfront, side and knee airbags. 

Also new forthe E85 is the battery cable monitoring circuit. Since the battery cable on 
the E85 is routed on the exterior, ratherthan the interior on previous models, there is now 
a monitoring circuit used. This protects the battery cable from short circuits by activating 
the BST. This circuit is routed through the SBSL and SBSR. 

Some of the familiar components carried overfromthe ISIS have been modified for use in 
the E85 ASE system. The SIM, SBSL and SBSR now incorporate acceleration sensors 
to detect impacts. Previously, in ISIS, these acceleration sensors were distributed to 
other satellites which are not used on the E85.

ASE System Components (E85) 


Safety and Information Module 


The SIM is located underthe centerconsole in 
the E85. The SIM is responsible for the following 
functions: 

• The satellite power supply. Reserve power 
supply in the event of a power loss during an 
accident. (Power reserve 33V) 

• The function of the star coupler (4 S/E mod¬ 
ules) and the byteflight bus main controller 
(master) 

• Receives input from passenger airbag deac¬ 
tivation switch 



• Acts as gateway between byteflight and 
K-bus 


• Provides crash report for triggering various 
functions in other systems 

• Actuates warning circuit for "Passenger 
Airbag Off" lamp in centerconsole 

• Contains lateral and longitudinal acceleration 
sensors. 

The values are transferred to all the satellites via 
the byteflight, in the same way as the values 
measured by the satellites. These measured val¬ 
ues are used by the algorithms in the satellites. 
The SIM compares the values and, if the impact 
is of sufficient severity, it uses the synchronization 
pulses to initiate alarm mode. 



The alarm mode places the satellites in a trigger- 
able state. The actuators required are actuated, 
depending upon the accident severity and the 
stored algorithms. 


If the passenger airbag deactivation switch is set to "off", the passenger side airbag, knee 
airbag and passenger side door airbag will not be deployed. 


The SIM is centrally mounted and incorporates the lateral and longitudinal acceleration 
sensors, this allows the SIM to replace the SFZ used in the ISIS. 


As far as diagnosis is concerned, the SIM carries out two functions (SIM, ZGM). These 
functions, although in a common housing, have separate diagnostic addresses and use 
separate microprocessors.

Left and Right Door Satellites (STVL/STVR) 



The STVL/STVR is located on the right and left hand doors respectively. These satellite 
provide crash information by sensing the pressure in the door cavity. Upon side door 
impact, the sudden pressure increase is detected by the sensor. This information is 
processed and sent to the SIM via byteflight. 


1. STVL/STVR 


The measured values are also transferred across the byteflight in parallel to the other 
satellites.T he power supply of the satellite is also from the SIM and it is buffered by the 
memory backup capacitor. In sleep mode of the byteflight, the powersupply of the 
STVL/R is deactivated by the SIM . 

The STVL and STVR do not contain any acceleration sensors or ignition circuits.

B + Cable Monitoring 

The E85 B + Battery Cable is routed from trunk area along the underside of the car into 
the engine compartment. If the cable is damaged in an accident or while driving over an 
obstacle, the BST is activated, protecting the vehicle from further electrical problems. 



The battery cable on the E85 is fitted with a low impedance metal mesh. This mesh sur¬ 
rounds the B +cable insulation and is also covered by an additional insulation. The metal 
mesh is referred to as the monitoring shield.

Battery Cable Monitoring Circuit 

The battery cable is diagnosed by a special circuit between the SBSL and SBSR satel¬ 
lites. The battery cable diagnosis takes place across the low impedance shield of the bat¬ 
tery cable (monitoring shield). 

There are connections to the left B-pillar satellite and the right B-pillar satellite at both 
ends of the shield. This means that there is usually the same voltage at the analog/digital 
converters in the satellites. If the voltages differ, there is a fault.

The monitoring shield consists of a low-impedance metal mesh. A connection cable 
exits from each end of the monitoring shield (at the safety battery terminal in the luggage 
compartment and at the battery ground point in the engine compartment). 

The connection at the safety battery terminal in the luggage compartment is connected 
to the right B-pillar satellite. The second connection cable in the engine compartment is 
connected to the left B-pillar satellite. 

The satellites contain analog/digital converters that are connected to the microprocessor 
of the satellite. The connection cables of the battery cable diagnosis are connected to the 
A/D converters. The right B-pillar satellite contains a pull-up resistor. The left B-pillar 
satellite contains a pull-down resistor of the same size. 

The voltage supply of the satellite (approx. 10 V) is applied at the pull-up resistor. Ground 
is applied at the pull-down resistor. 


54 

byteflight safety systems 





































The very low-impedance cable and the resistors of the same size mean that around half 
the voltage (approx. 5 V) is applied at the A/D converters. 

In the event of a fault, significantly different measured values would result as follows: 


State

Every 250 ms, the values are measured, triggered by the synchronization pulse. If the bat¬ 
tery cable is OK, the values are transferred every 20 ms to the SIM. If a significant devia¬ 
tion of the values occurs, the new values are transferred immediately. 

In the following cases, the battery cable is cut off by the safety battery terminal from the 
battery and the alternator is switched off: 

• Shortcircuitto ground (body) 


• Short to battery positive

If the outer insulation is damaged (e.g. due to friction/scuffing), but the monitoring shield 
has no connection to ground, the following case could occur: 

Moisture (rain) would mean that the voltage would gradually fall. A short circuitto ground 
would be detected, but the safety battery terminal would not be triggered. 

The entry "Implausible measured value" is set in the fault code memory. This would be 
indicated to the driver by the airbag warning lamp. 

Battery Cable Diagnosis 

If the shielding of the battery cable is damaged, the battery cable must be replaced com¬ 
pletely. It is not permitted to perform repairs to the shielding.

byteflight safety systems 












Passenger Airbag Deactivation 

Due to the fact that the E85 is a 2 seat roadster, there is a need to deactivate the passen¬ 
ger airbag to accommodate children and child seats. A switch has been added to allow 
this function to be possible. 

The switch, which is actuated by the vehicle key, is located on the right side of the dash¬ 
board nearthe a-pillar. Access to the switch is only possible with the passenger door 
open. This prevents any "accidental" or unwanted switch actuation while the vehicle is 
in motion. 



The airbag switch is an input to the SIM . Once the SIM detects an "off" request from the 
switch, the passenger side airbag, door airbag, seatbelt tensioner and knee airbag are 
deactivated. 

The SIM also activates the "Passenger Airbag Off" indicator light which is located in the 
center console. The indicator light contains several LED's which are controlled by the 
SIM. The SIM also monitors the indicator light during the self check. The AWL will be 
illuminated if any faults are detected. 

SeatOccupancy Detection (SBE) 

As with previous BMW models, the passenger seat is monitored by the SBE system. 

The SBE system in the E85 operates the same as previous SBE systems. The seat 
"recognition" signal is sentto the passengerside b-pillarsatellite. This configuration is 
used until 9/2003 production. 

From 9/2003 production, the E85 has adopted the OC-3 seat occupancy recognition 
system. The airbag off switch has been retained in the event that a passenger may be 
too close to the deactivation threshold. Due to the factthatthe E85 is a roadster, there is 
no option of sitting in the rear. The deactivation switch allows the airbag to be shut off 
when needed. 


56 

byteflight safety systems 




PassengerSeatOccupancy Detection (OC-3) 

As of 9/2003, the new occupancy detection system has been added to the E85. 

Current governmental safety regulations make it necessary for the passive safety system 
to be able to determine the approximate size and weight of the passenger. This enables 
the system to deactivate the passenger side airbag when traveling with a child or an 
infant in a child seat. 

To accomplish this, the existing SBE system was subsequently developed into the new 
"intelligent occupant classifier" (Occupant Classification) or OC-3 system. This was 
achieved by: 

• Adding a larger number of "force sensitive" resistance elements. 

• Dividing the detection mat into zones which coverthe entire seat area. 

• Using an intelligent electronic analyzer. 

The OC-3 sensor mat is capable of distinguishing between a one-year old child in a child 
seat and a light person. This is done by analyzing the distribution of weight across the 
seat. For example, a child in a child seat would be distinguished from a 90 pound adult 
by the contact pattern. In other words, the contact pattern of a child seat would differ 
considerably from an adult due to the spacing of the hip bones vs. the child seat "rails". 



E 

3 

u; 

The OC-3 sensor mat is integrated into the lower seat pad area of the passenger seat. 
The mat consists of conductors with pressure-dependent resistor elements also known 
as FSR (Force Sensitive Resistance) elements. 

The conductors are connected to the electronic analyzer. The FSR elements are wired in 
such a way so that they can be sampled individually. 




57 

byteflight safety systems 








When a mechanical load on a sensor increases, the electrical resistance decreases and 
the measurement changes accordingly. 



By analyzing the signals from the individual sensors, the electronic analyzer maps the 
occupancy of the seat surface and can identify local concentrations of weight. The dis¬ 
tances between the areas and concentrations of weight indicate whetherthe occupant is 
small or large. An algorithm is used to compute the weight class and decide whetherthe 
seat is occupied by a person ora child seat. 

The width between the hip bones is related to the weight of the person. Consequently, 
the analyzer can distinguish between a light person and a heavy person. 

The electronic analyzer sends a telegram to the SBSR via a dedicated signal line. If the 
occupant is classified as a child in a child seat, the airbags on the passenger side are 
deactivated. The SBSR sends a telegram to the the SIM via byteflight and the SIM 
responds by illuminating the "passenger airbag off" lamp in the center console.

ASE System Overview (E60) 

The ASE system on the E60 is based on the same technology as the E85. Howeverthe 
E60 uses considerably more components than E85. The ASE system has been adapted 
for use on the E60. 

The most notable change in the system (as compared to E85 and ISIS), is the SGM. The 
SGM has the combined functions forthe ZGM and the SIM . This is similarto the E85. 
Although each of the functions are located in the same housing, the ZGM and SIM have 
their own diagnostic address.

The E60 also uses new technology for passenger seat occupancy detection. The new 
OC-3 (Occupant Classification-3) system can detect the approximate size and weight of 
a passenger or if a baby seat has been installed. 

Also, new up-front sensors are used to further fine tune crash detection. They are locat¬ 
ed behind the front bumper area. These sensors are accelerometers which are capable 
of detecting acceleration as well as deceleration. 

Passive knee protection is also added to the driver and passenger side. It consists of 
reinforced plastic absorbers on the glove box door and lower steering column areas. 

SOS and emergency call capability has also been added. All E60 vehicles will have a 
TCU installed with GPS capability for location by emergency personnel.

ASE Components E60 


Safety and Gateway Module (SGM) 

The SGM is a combination ofthe SIM (E65) 
and the ZGM (E65). The SGM performs all of 
the software functions ofthe ZGM. The func¬ 
tions and hardware ofthe SIM have been inte¬ 
grated into the SGM with some new functions 
added. 

The SGM is located in the module carrier 
behind the glove box. There are 2 versions of 
the SGM used in US models. One uses a pur¬ 
ple connectorwhich is forvehicles without 
AFS orServotronic. The other has a beige 
connector and contains the output stages for 
AFS and Servotronic. 

The SGM performs the following functions: 

• Provides satellite power supply and reserve voltage (60V) if the powersupply should 
fail during an accident. 

• The function ofthe star coupler and the byteflig ht bus main controller (master). 
The SGM contains 6 S/E modules. 

• Acts as a gateway between the byteflight, K-CAN, PT-CAN and D-bus. 

• Retains the history memory. 

• Provides crash report (telegram) for trig¬ 
gering various functions of other systems. 

• Controls and monitors the output stage 
for the Servotronic valve (optional). 

• Controls and monitors the output stage 
for the ECO valve (optional).

Voltage Supply 

The SGM is supplied with voltage via KL30 and KL31. A voltage transformer (10.2V) and 
an intelligent distributor with over current protection carry voltage to the satellites. If a 
fault occurs, the distributor can shut off the supply to individual satellites. 

Power Reserve 

At the same time the power reserve is charged. The power reserve consists of a 60 volt 
capacitor. If the on board supply voltage drops below a defined level, the power reserve is 
switched on. In this way, the entire functionality of the safety system is maintained for 1 
second, which is the time it takes to drain the power reserve. 

Note: When performing work on the safety system, always bear in mind that 
the capacitors will take a few seconds to discharge afterthe battery has 
been disconnected. The safety system remains capable of deploying an 
airbag during this period. Always refer to applicable repair instructions 
and rigidly observe all safety precautions. 


65 

byteflight safety systems 





StarCoupler 

The star coupler and the 6 S/E modules are powered via a downstream transformer (5V). 
The same applies forthe two microprocessors. The individual fiberoptic cables to the 
satellites are connected to the star coupler. The star coupler emits a synchronization 
pulse every 250ms. The messages to and from the satellites (bi-directional) are trans¬ 
ferred via the byteflight between these synchronization pulses. 

The satellites accommodate acceleration and pressure sensors. These are the sensors 
that detect a collision. The sensor data is transmitted from the satellites to the star cou¬ 
pler. The star coupler distributes the information to all the satellites. In this way, all the 
satellites have the same information at their disposal. 

The SGM uses the information it receives to recognize the occurrence of a collision. The 
SGM compares the values with the algorithm in it processor and, if the impact is of suffi¬ 
cient severity, it uses the synchronization pulse to initiate alarm mode. 

The alarm mode places the satellites in a triggerable state. The actuators required in any 
given situation are actuated depending upon the accident severity and the algorithms 
stored in the satellites. 

Gateway 

All the functions of the Central Gateway Module in the E65 are integrated into the SGM . 
The gateway function is responsible for interconnecting the various bus systems in the 
E60. 

The E60 uses the byteflight bus, K-CAN, PT-CAN, D-Bus and the MOST. The gate¬ 
way forthe MOST is in the M-ASK which is connected to the K-CAN. 

The gateway is needed to allow communication across different bus systems. Bus sys¬ 
tem communication differs in data rate, bandwidth and message structure. Also the 
gateway allows copper wire bus systems to communicate with optical bus systems. 

All connected buses, with the exception of the diagnostic bus, can wake up the gateway. 
This differs from the E65, in which the wakeup can also be signalled by the diagnostic 
lead. This is done by a wake up logic which controls the voltage supply of the module. A 
non-volatile data memory is also integrated in the ZGM which can be used to store con¬ 
figuration and diagnostic data. 

As all the systems in the vehicle are networked, the same data can be used for different 
applications. 

Gateway from K-CAN to ASE 

Information and messages from the ASE system are sent from the K-CAN to the SGM as 
a message. The following messages are sent: 

• Terminal status (KL30,15, R etc) 

• Odometertotal mileage 

• Chassis number(VIN)

History Memory 

In the E60, the problem of a dead battery due to parasitic current draw is counteracted by 
various measures. F irstly all consumers that do not need to be permanently connected 
to the battery are switched off via a relay (KL30g). In addition, the off-load current is con¬ 
stantly monitored by the intelligent battery sensor (IBS). 

The bus systems are also monitored. A non-volatile memory (NVRAM) is implemented in 
the SGM so that the following faulty behaviorcan be logged: 

• Which bus has woken up the entire system 

• Which bus subscriber (module) prevented the bus system from entering sleep mode 
following the shutdown ofterminal R and the expiration of the run on time (30 min). 

Each entry in the history memory identifies the originator and logs the time of day and the 
odometer reading. In this way, dependable diagnosis can subsequently be performed.

Driver/Passenger Door Module TM FA/TM B F 

The driver/passenger door module is a combination of the door module with the body 
electronics and the front door satellite. The TM FA/TM BF controls and monitors the igni¬ 
tion circuits forthe door mounted side airbag. It also detects side-impact collisions using 
the pressure sensor in the door.

B-pillar Satellite Left/Right SBSL/SBSR 

The left and right b-pillar satellites are connected to the SGM via byteflight. As on 
other satellites, the powersupply is provided by the SGM and it is buffered by a capacitor. 
When in sleep mode, the powersupply of the satellites is deactivated by the SGM . 

Each satellite contains an acceleration sensorfor longitudinal acceleration and one for lat¬ 
eral acceleration. The sensors provide a voltage as a measured value. These values are 
made available on a continuous basis and are transferred to the SGM and other satellites 

via byteflight.

When the SGM detects a critical range, the alarm mode is by means of the synchroniza¬ 
tion pulse. The alarm mode places the satellites in a triggerable state. The trigger matrix 
stored in the satellites activates the necessary actuators depending upon crash severity. 


The trigger circuits of the actuators are connected to the ignition final stages in the satel¬ 
lites and ignited by discharging capacitors. 

The self-diagnosis of the trigger circuits during the pre-drive check is the same for all 
satellites. 

Battery cable diagnosis is performed by both satellites. Each satellites forms a portion of 
the battery cable monitoring circuit. One end of the cable connection is located in the 
engine compartment and is connected to the SBSL. The otherend, which is connected 
to the SBSR is located in the luggage compartment.

TheSBSR controls and monitors the following trigger circuits: 

• Front airbag, passenger 

• Head airbag AITS, right 

• Side airbag, rear right 

• Seatbelt tensioner, right 

• Seatbelt tensioner, rear right 

The SBSR also receives input from the passenger seat occupancy detection system. 
The sensor mat has an electronic evaluation unit (analyzer) that sends seat occupancy 
information via a dedicated signal line. 

The SBSL/SBSR are located low in their respective B-pillars nearthe seatbelt reel.

Vehicle Center Satellite 

The SFZ controls and monitors the trigger circuit for the BST. It is located on the trans¬ 
mission tunnel and connected to the SGM via byteflight. 

As on other satellites, the power supply is provided by the SGM and it is buffered by a 
capacitor. When in sleep mode, the power supply ofthe SFZ is deactivated by the SGM. 

The SFZ also contains lateral and longitudinal acceleration sensors. These measure¬ 
ments are provided as voltage values and transferred to the SGM and other satellites via 

byteflight.

Up-Front Sensors 

In the US, seatbelts are not a federal requirement. This legislation is on a state-by-state 
basis. Therefore, adequate provisions must be made to ensure that the airbag can reli¬ 
ably restrain the occupant in the event of a crash. 



02 

The up-front sensors were added to "fine-tune" crash detection. The location of the 
sensors allow the ASE system to detect frontal impacts earlier. Both sensors are identical 
forthe left and right side. 

Each sensor consists of a longitudinal acceleration sensor and an electronic evaluation 
unit for signal processing and data transfer. The acceleration sensor is capable of detect¬ 
ing front as well as rear impacts. The values from the sensors are converted into digital 
signals and sent to the SGM for analysis. 

The up-front sensors are located behind the bumper reinforcement nearthe engine sup¬ 
port arms. 

Note: In the event of a crash that triggers the airbags, both up-front sensors 
must be replaced. Even of no external damage is perceptible, the sensors may 
be damaged internally. Always referto and comply with the most current and 
relevant repair instructions.

B + Cable Monitoring 

The E60 B + Battery Cable is routed from trunk area along the underside of the car into 
the engine compartment. If the cable is damaged in an accident or while driving over an 
obstacle, the BST is activated, protecting the vehicle from further electrical problems. 



The battery cable on the E60 is fitted with a low impedance metal mesh. This mesh 
surrounds the B +cable insulation and is also covered by an additional insulation. 

The metal mesh is referred to as the monitoring shield.

Battery Cable Monitoring Circuit 

The battery cable is diagnosed by a special circuit between the SBSL and SBSR satel¬ 
lites. The battery cable diagnosis takes place across the low impedance shield of the bat¬ 
tery cable (monitoring shield). 

There are connections to the left B-pillar satellite and the right B-pillar satellite at both 
ends of the shield. This means that there is usually the same voltage at the analog/digital 
converters in the satellites. If the voltages differ, there is a fault.

The monitoring shield consists of a low-impedance metal mesh. A connection cable 
exits from each end of the monitoring shield (at the safety battery terminal in the luggage 
compartment and at the battery ground point in the engine compartment). 


The connection at the safety battery terminal in the luggage compartment is connected 
to the right B-pillar satellite. The second connection cable in the engine compartment is 
connected to the left B-pillar satellite. 

The satellites contain analog/digital converters that are connected to the microprocessor 
of the satellite. The connection cables of the battery cable diagnosis are connected to the 
A/D converters. The right B-pillar satellite contains a pull-up resistor. The left B-pillar 
satellite contains a pull-down resistor of the same size. 

The voltage supply of the satellite (approx. 10 V) is applied at the pull-up resistor. Ground 
is applied at the pull-down resistor. 


76 

byteflight safety systems 







































The very low-impedance cable and the resistors of the same size mean that around half 
the voltage (approx. 5 V) is applied at the A/D converters. 


In the event of a fault, significantly different measured values would result as follows: 


State

Every 250 ms, the values are measured, triggered by the synchronization pulse. If the bat¬ 
tery cable is OK, the values are transferred every 20 ms to the SGM. If a significant devia¬ 
tion of the values occurs, the new values are transferred immediately. 

In the following cases, the battery cable is cut off by the safety battery terminal from the 
battery and the alternator is switched off: 

• Shortcircuitto ground (body) 

• Short to battery positive 


If the outer insulation is damaged (e.g. due to friction/scuffing), but the monitoring shield

has no connection to ground, the following case could occur: 

Moisture (rain) would mean that the voltage would gradually fall. A short circuitto ground 
would be detected, but the safety battery terminal would not be triggered. 

The entry "Implausible measured value" is set in the fault code memory. This would be 
indicated to the driver by the airbag warning lamp. 

Battery Cable Diagnosis 

If the shielding of the battery cable is damaged, the battery cable must be replaced com¬ 
pletely. It is not permitted to perform repairs to the shielding.

PassengerSeatOccupancy Detection (OC-3) 

The new occupancy detection system is a further enhancement ofthe the existing SBE 
system. Current governmental safety regulations make it necessary for the passive safety 
system to be able to determine the approximate size and weight ofthe passenger. This 
enables the system to deactivate the passenger side airbag when traveling with a child or 
an infant ina child seat. 

To accomplish this, the existing SBE system was subsequently developed into the new 
"intelligent occupant classifier" (Occupant Classification) or OC-3 system. This was 
achieved by: 

• Adding a larger number of "force sensitive" resistance elements. 

• Dividing the detection mat into zones which coverthe entire seat area. 

• Using an intelligent electronic analyzer. 

The OC-3 sensor mat is capable of distinguishing between a one-year old child in a child 
seat and a light person. This is done by analyzing the distribution of weight across the 
seat. For example, a child in a child seat would be distinguished from a 90 pound adult 
by the contact pattern. In other words, the contact pattern of a child seat would differ 
considerably from an adult due to the spacing ofthe hip bones vs. the child seat "rails". 



The OC-3 sensor mat is integrated into the lower seat pad area ofthe passenger seat. 
The mat consists of conductors with pressure-dependent resistor elements also known 
as FSR (Force Sensitive Resistance) elements. 

The conductors are connected to the electronic analyzer. The FSR elements are wired in 
such a way so that they can be sampled individually. 


78 

byteflight safety systems 





















When a mechanical load on a sensor increases, the electrical resistance decreases and 
the measurement changes accordingly. 


OC-3 Sensor Mat 




By analyzing the signals from the individual sensors, the electronic analyzer maps the 
occupancy of the seat surface and can identify local concentrations of weight. The dis¬ 
tances between the areas and concentrations of weight indicate whetherthe occupant is 
small or large. An algorithm is used to compute the weight class and decide whetherthe 
seat is occupied by a person ora child seat. 

The width between the hip bones is related to the weight of the person. Consequently, 
the analyzer can distinguish between a light person and a heavy person.

The electronic analyzer sends a telegram to the SBSR via a dedicated signal line. If the 
occupant is classified as a child in a child seat, the airbags on the passenger side are 
deactivated. The SBSR sends a telegram to the the SGM via by teflight and the SGM 
responds by illuminating the "passenger airbag off" lamp in the overhead panel.

Airbag Indicator Lamp 

The "passenger airbag off" indicator light is located in the front overhead console. This 
light is controlled via a PWM signal from the SGM based on data from the OC-3 system. 

The lamp contains 2 LED's for redundancy. If one LED fails, a fault code will be stored in 
the SGM and the AWL will be illuminated.

Service Information (E60) 


Passenger Airbag Module 

If the passenger airbag module is triggered, the supporting tube has to be checked. The 
forces to which it is exposed are high, and the possibility of the supporting tube deform¬ 
ing cannot be excluded. Consequently, the supporting tube has to be checked and, if 
necessary, replaced. 

Battery Cable Diagnosis 

If the shielding of the battery cable is damaged, the battery cable must be replaced com¬ 
pletely. It is not permitted to repairthe shielding. 

Safety Battery Terminal 

If the safety battery terminal is triggered, the battery cable has to be replaced all the way 
back to the main adapter point in the luggage compartment. Repair is not intended. 

Door Module, Driver's Door/Passenger Door 

When removing the door module, it is essential to ensure that the two inner screws (2) of 
the door module are not removed. These screws hold the housing of the door module 
together and ensure that the pressure sensor is sealed. If the screws are slackened there 
is a possibility that the pressure sensor will no longer operate correctly. 

Up-Front Sensors 

In the event of a crash that triggers the airbags, the up-front sensors have to be replaced. 
The sensors might be damaged internally, even though no external damage is percepti¬ 
ble. Always comply with the instructions in the repair manual when replacing the up-front 
sensors. 

Synchronization of New Modules 

When new satellite modules are fitted, these modules have no system time. 

Transmission of the two system time telegrams allows the module to adapt the system 
time. This is only possible when the stored system time in the satellite modules is small- 
erthan the time sent. 

If the system time in a module is greaterthan the time sent, (Ex. trying a part from anoth¬ 
er vehicle), the system time is not adopted and an entry is made into fault memory. 

When the SIM or any satellite is replaced, the system time must be entered. As the sys¬ 
tem time is available in all ASE modules, it can be transferred into the new module. 

This takes place via the Diagnosis Program (Service Functions). To do so, the DISplus 
/GT1, requests the system time from all satellites and selects the largest. 

The DIS plus/GT 1 add an amount to this time and transmits the result into the new mod¬ 
ule as the system time. The correction amount compensates for the run time between 
reading from the satellites and entry into the new module. 

This prevents fault messages from the satellites because the system time transferred by 
the new module is smallerthan that stored in the satellites.

Passive Safety Components 

The following represents the passive safety components specific to to the vehicles using 
"byteflight based" passive safety systems including E65, E66, E60, E63, E64 and E85. 
Model specific components will be pointed out where applicable. 

Driver Front Airbag 

Two-stage "SMART" airbags have been available on BMW models since the 1999 
model year. 

Depending upon the level of crash severity, both ignition stages are activated at timed 
intervals. The time difference between ignition intervals determines the deployment 
force of the airbag. 


E65 Driver's side airbag, front view E65 Driver's side airbag, rearview 



1. Ignition stage 1 2. Ignition stage 2 


Driver's airbags are available in the standard or 
sport configuration depending upon optional 
equipment. Some airbags are available color 
matched to the interior. Colors include black, 
beige, grey or blue. 

These new style airbags use are "clipped" in 
rather than using screw type fasteners. Refer 
to the relevant repair instructions for removal 
and installation. 


WARNING 


When storing an airbag during repair 
procedures always place airbag with the 
BMW emblem facing up. This reduces the 
danger in the event of a spontaneous 
deployment.

byteflight safety systems 







Passenger Front Airbag 

The passenger airbag also uses the 2-stage deployment technology. It uses a hybrid 
method for ignition using a combination of solid fuel and inert gas. The passenger airbag 
on the newer vehicles (E6X) no longer uses a separate cover on the dash panel. The 
dash panel has internal perforation that is designed to tear at pre-determined points. 

E65 Dash Panel, passenger side E65 airbag, passengerside 



This method prevents the airbag from being deflected in the eventthatthe panel does 
not swing out of the way properly.

byteflight safety systems 














Knee Airbags 

Introduced on the E65, the knee airbag is a new 
innovation for BMW models. The knee airbags are 
installed on the driver and passenger side. 

In the event of a crash, the knee airbags not only sup¬ 
port the knee, but initiate a controlled forward shift of 
the upper body. This controlled shift places the 
upper body in the correct location to allow proper 
contact with the airbag. 

The driver's side knee airbag is installed in the under 
dash trim, right below the steering column. The pas¬ 
senger side knee airbag is part of the glovebox lid. 



The knee airbag ignition circuit consists of only one stage. Knee airbags are currently 
available on the E65, E66, E63, E64 and E85.

The side airbags in the doors reduce the risk of occupant injury in the torso region of the 
body in the case of a side-on crash. The side airbags are folded into an aluminum hous¬ 
ing with a plastic cover behind the doortrim. In the area of the side airbag in the door 
trim is a tear seam. 

The side airbags are secured to the inner door panel with 3 screws. The plastic cover 
has defined breaking points. 

In a side impact of sufficient severity, the side airbag is triggered. The side airbag exits 
through the split line and deploys between the door and the seat occupants.

Head Protection Systems 

New forthe E65 is the Advanced Head Protection System (AHPS) which is an extended 
head airbag. The ITS Inflatable Tubular Structure familiarfrom other BMW models has 
been extended by a curtain. 

The E60 and E63 have adopted a similar design referred to as Advanced Inflatable 
Tubular Structure (AITS). 

There are two versions of the AHPS (or AITS). 

The Advanced HPS I (or AITS I) is forthe head area of the driver and passenger. It runs 
from the A-pillarto behind the B-pillar, as before. The volume is approx. 12 liters. 

E60 showing AITS II 



When rear airbags are ordered as an option, there is the 
Advanced HPS II (AITS ll)for the head area at the front and 
rear. The AHPS II runs from the A-pillarto the C-pillarand 
covers the entire side section. The volume is approx. 24 
liters. 

In conjunction with the side airbags in the front and rear 
doors, it provides optimum side protection for all passengers. 
The Advanced HPS prevents the head and other extremities 
of the occupants from swinging outward. This leads to less 
severe neck backlash forces and less severe head injuries. 

Advantages of the system: 

• Extended coverage area for side windows front and rear. 

• Protection against glass splinters and penetrating 
objects. 

• Improved protection area for any size occupants.

Operation 

The Advanced HPS is fitted in the roof zone. 

It consists of a woven tube with an additional 
curtain wrapped around it. The curtain is 
secured to the roof frame and is tensioned 
downward by the woven tube. 

In the event of a side collision, the generator is 
ignited and the gas flows through the gas 
injector into the woven tube. The woven tube 
expands to approx. 130 mm in diameter and 
its length is reduced. 

Secure fitting of the woven tube on the A-pillar 
and the C-pillar HPS II oron the roofframe 
(AHPS I) brings the head airbag into position. 

In the process, the curtain tightens between 
the side window or pillartrim and the occu¬ 
pant. 

The high tensioning force in the woven tube 
pulls the curtain downward, which increases 
the stability of the curtain. The closed system 
means that the structural firmness and stability 
remain for several seconds. This is an advan¬ 
tage if the vehicle rolls over.

Active Head Restraint System 

One of the innovations introduced on the E65 was the AKS or Active Head Restraint 
System. The AKS has also been added to the E60 as well. 

AKS is only used on the multifunction (comfort) seat. The basic seat does not need the 
AKS due to the fact that the position of the occupants head is always in close proximity to 
the headrest. The comfort seat has an articulated upper backrest which can create a 
sizeable distance between the head of the occupant and the headrest. 

In a rear collision, the torso of the occupant is accelerated with the vehicle. Howeverthe 
head, which is not on constant contact with the seat, is susceptible to high g-forces 
which can lead to cervical vertebrae injuries (whiplash). 


Forthis reason, the AKS is designed to reduce the gap between the head restraint and 
the head to reduce the possibility of whiplash.

The active head restraint system is located in the backrest of the comfort seat. The AKS 
consists of a support tube, which is fitted on bearings in the backrest. A retaining plate 
attaches the system firmly to the backrest.

byteflight safety systems 






































The support tube serves as a fixture forthe head restraint. The adjustment mechanism 
of the head restraint is also attached to the support tube. 

The adjustment mechanism consists of a retaining plate and a sliding element. The slid¬ 
ing element is a moveable part connected to the gate located on the support tube. The 
retaining plate is firmly attached to the backrest. The generator is located between the 
retaining plate and the sliding element. 



The generator consists of a casing, plunger, ignition stages and an electrical connection. 
It is attached to the retaining plate and sliding element by spring clips. 

In the event of a crash, the ignition stage is activated, the solid fuel burns and the gas 
produced forces out the push rod. The push rod moves out and shifts the sliding ele¬ 
ment. 

The support tube is pivoted forwards because ofthe slanted, elongated holes in the sup¬ 
port tube which the sliding element rides in. 

This means that the head restraint attached to the support tube is also moved in the 
direction of travel. The adjustment range ofthe headrest is approx. 9 degrees. 

Depending on the vertical adjustment ofthe head restraint at the time, different adjusting 
distances can result. The adjustment ofthe head restraint, measured on the cushion, is 
approx. 40 mm when the head restraint is retracted (all the way down). 

When the head restraint is fully extended (all the way up), the adjustment is approx. 60 
mm. 

If the Active Head restraint has been triggered in a crash, only the gas generator needs to 
be replaced to return the system to normal function.

Battery Safety Terminal (BST) 


The Battery SafetyTerminal (BST) is technically identical to the one used in M RS sys¬ 
tems. BST is used on all current BM W models including all E6X models. 

If the ISIS system detects a crash of sufficient severity, the ignition stage of the BST is 
triggered bythe B-pillarsatellite, right (SBSR). 

A small quantity of solid fuel electrically and mechanically cuts the starter and alternator 
line from the positive terminal of the battery. This prevents possible short circuits in the 
engine compartment. 

A separate vehicle electrical system connection through the Power M odule ensures that 
the remaining vehicle circuit retains its function when the BST is triggered. 

This ensures the operation of all the important functions such as lights, hazard warning 
lights, telephone emergency call, etc.

BeltTensioning Systems 


Front BeltTension Limiter (E65/E66) 

The belt tension limiters for the driver and pas¬ 
senger seat are inertia reel seatbelts with adap¬ 
tive force limitation. 

A gas generator is used to switch from a high 
degree offeree to a lower degree offeree. This 
also has to be possible during an accident to 
achieve a regressive force reduction. The 
advantage of the adaptive belt tension limiter is 
the considerable reduction of the load on the 
chest in the event of a crash. 



With optimum coordination to the airbag, the 
kinetic energy of the occupant is reduced 
evenly across the duration of the crash, thus 
achieving low occupant load values.

Operation 

The adaptive force limitation is based on a two-stage torsion bar (stage shaft). The torsion 
bar consists of the two head ends left and right, the stages and the center head. The belt 
force is transferred to the seatbelt roller. The seatbelt roller is connected to a sleeve that 
contains the torsion bar. There is a shaft ring with locking pawls on the sleeve.The lock¬ 
ing pawls transferthe torque to the torsion bar. 

In the first stage, with the preset high level of force, the torque of the seatbelt roller is 
transferred via the locking pawls to the center head of the torsion bar. 

If the seatbelt roller is turned relative to the fixed torsion bar, the force is transferred to the 
thicker part of the torsion bar. This produces the high power level. This is the function of 
a normal emergency locking retractor.

In the event of a crash, the gas generator is ignited and a plunger moves out, shifting the 
shaft ring axially. The locking pawls are now no longer held by the sleeve and no longer 
transfer more torque to the center head of the torsion bar. 


The belt force is now passed across the right-hand head end into the stage shaft and 
runs through the entire torsion bar. The lower diameter on the right-hand side means that 
the torsion bar is twisted further and thus the force is reduced to a lower level.

Seatbelt Upper Anchor Position 

Using new simulation methods with regard to 
installation and ergonomics, it was determined 
that there is an optimal area for all occupants 
to locate the seatbelt upper anchor. 

The anchor point is no longer adjusted auto¬ 
matically based on seat movement as the sys¬ 
tem on the previous model. In addition the fit¬ 
ting is now designed as a roller. The low fric¬ 
tion power (drag) of the seatbelt increases 
wearing comfort. 



101 

byteflight safety systems 











Rear Seatbelt (End F itting) Tensioner (E 65/E 66) 


If the rear airbag package is ordered, end fitting 
tensioners are fitted for the outer rear seats. In the 
middle, a three-point automatic belt is fitted. (The 
basic version has 3 three-point automatic belts.) 

The rear end fitting tensioners have the same task 
as the seatbelt tensioners at the front, that is 
removing the slack in the belt during the crash as 
well as early binding of the occupant to the vehicle 
deceleration (called riding out the crash). 

S ince the space available beneath the rear seat is 
limited, it meant that a component similarto the 
front seatbelt tensioner could not be used, a new 
solution had to be found. 

The belt slack is removed by drawing in the seat- 
belt strap at the end fitting point. The inertia reel 
seatbelt forms the upper attachment point, the 
end fitting tensioner is the lower attachment point. 



Operation 

The rear seat satellite (SSH) ignites the ignition 
stage in the event of a crash if the seat has been 
detected as occupied. 

When the gas generator ignites, the rise in 
pressure shifts a plunger in the pipe. The cable 
end is drawn in the pipe in a linear direction by 
the plunger. The other cable end is wound by 
a pulley and turns the belt winding shaft. 

A roller coupling blocks the belt winding shaft 
so that when force is applied into the belt sys¬ 
tem afterthe tensioning process this can no 
longer be turned back. The end fitting ten¬ 
sioners tighten the belt slack at the pelvic area 
first and then the chest area belt slack. 

The tensioning path is determined by the 
cable pulley diameter and the usable plunger 
travel. The maximum tensioning length is 
approx. 150 mm.

Front SeatbeltTensioners (E6X vehicles) 

On the E6X vehicles , pyrotechnic seatbelt 
tensioners are used for the driver and passen¬ 
ger seat. The principle of the seatbelt lock ten¬ 
sioner is the same as that used in the 
E38/E39. 

The seatbelt tensioner has the task in the 
event of a crash to remove or reduce any belt 
slack in the pelvic and shoulder region. 

The belt slack comes about mainly due to the 
motion of the occupants or due to clothing, 

(especially when heavy clothing are worn in 
the winter). 

This ensures that the occupant is restrained 
firmly on the seat and prevents "submarining", 
slipping under a slack seatbelt. 

There is also earlier restraint and thus earlier binding to the vehicle. The seatbelt tension- 
erforms a unit with the seatbelt buckle. It consists of an ignition stage, generator, plunger 
and cable. The belt buckle switch is integrated in the seatbelt buckle. 

In the event of a crash of sufficient severity, the gas generator is ignited. The gas spreads 
and shifts the plunger in the tensioning pipe. The cable connected to the plungerthen 
pulls the seatbelt buckle downward and the belt slack from the belt system. 

Forthese models, there are the following technical changes. The ignition stage is no 
longer directly connected onto the gas generator but rather the connection comes out on 
a cable together with the belt buckle switch cable and is plugged underthe seat. If the 
seatbelt tensioner needs replacing, the seat does not have to be removed. 

S eat B elt B uc kle S witc h 

The belt buckle switch used in the E6X models is a two-wire Hall switch, as already in 
use in various models since 3/97. 

The airbags triggering thresholds are different depending on the crash severity and 
depending on whetherthe seatbelt has been fastened or not. 

The belt buckle switch is located in the seatbelt buckle on the driver and passenger seat. 
It is used to detect whetherthe seatbelt has been fastened or not. The detection arrives 
as a signal at the relevant satellites. The detection serves to trigger the pyrotechnic actua¬ 
tors in the event of a crash,( e.g. seatbelt tensioner, airbags etc.) 

The belt buckle switch also serves to initiate a seatbelt warning in case the vehicle is 
started without a seatbelt having been fastened.

Seat Integrated Belt Systems (SGS) 

The SGS system is used on vehicles that do 
not have a b-pillar post. The first vehicle to 
use the SGS seat was the E31. Currently, the 
E46 convertible and the E64 use the SGS 
seat. 

All seat belt attaching points including the 
upper anchor point are integral to the seat 
frame. All of the forces in a collision are 
absorbed by the seat frame and the floorpan. 

The SGS seat allows the best possible seat 
belt geometry in relation to the occupant. 

The seat belt is wrapped tightly around the 
occupant irrespective of seat position and 
body size. This helps reduce the amount of 
free seat belt length and also further reduces 
excessive slack. 

The features of the SGS seat are as follows: 

• All of the seat belt attachment points are 
connected to the seat frame. 

• The inertia reel clamps the seat belt 
at the closest possible point to the 
occupant. 

• Optimum protection of occupants in the event of a collision. 

• Seat belt strap is released when the backrest is folded or adjusted. 

• Comfort is maximized by allowing ideal body restraint for any seat setting or 
body size. 

• Restricted forward displacement of occupant due to additional seat belt strap 
tensioner. 

• More protection during rear and side impact. 

• No "submarining" effect. 

• Ideal solution forvehicles without b-pillar

SeatOccupancy Detection 

In addition to the conventional seat occupancy detection systems, the E65 also utilizes 
rear occupancy detection. 

Seat occupancy detection mats are installed in the seat cushion of the driver and passen¬ 
ger seat and if equipped with optional rear airbags, they are also used in the left and right 
rear seats. 

The sensor mat is identical to the mats used in previous models forthe MRS systems. 
The sensor system consists of pressure sensors that use an electronic evaluation unit 
(SBE)to detect whetherthere is weight on the seat. 

When a weight (such as a passenger) is added to the seat, the system recognizes the 
seat as occupied. The electronic evaluation units of the seat occupation mats are con¬ 
nected to the relevant satellites. 

(SSFA/SSBF=sensors for front seat, SSH=sensors for rear seat) 

The information regarding seat occupation is required for activation of the following 
functions: 

• Airbag activation 

• Activation of the seatbelt tensioners and/or end fitting tensioners 

• Triggering the active head restraints 

• Automatic positioning of the rear head restraints

Principle of Operation 


Fuel Pump Cutoff Circuit (E65/E66) 

Unique to the E65, is the operation of the fuel pump circuit. Ratherthan the conventional 
method of controlling the fuel pump via a DM E controlled relay, the fuel pump control 
circuit is now a function of the SBSR satellite. 

The fuel pump is controlled via a PWM signal from the SBSR which allows a variable 
delivery rate. The variable delivery rate is controlled by a request from the DM E which is 
based based upon engine requirements. 


The advantages of having a fuel pump with a variable delivery rate are: 

• Reduction of fuel tank warming (reduced evaporative emissions) 

• Reduction of power consumption by approximately 50 watts. 

• Increase offuel pump service life. 

• Integration of crash deactivation 

• Elimination of fuel pump relay 


PT-CAN 


byteflight 


DIME 




The SBSR contains additional circuitry forthe power supply of the fuel pump. The SBSR 
receives signals via byteflight for the operation of the fuel pump. 

The DME determines the fuel volume requirement in liters per hour. The SBSR receives 
the fuel requirements from the DM E (ECM) via the PT-CAN/byfef//gfit pathway. 

The delivery volume the fuel pump is regulated bythe EKP controller in the SBSR. The 
EKP controller supplies the fuel pump with PWM control voltage. 

The current consumption (amperage) of the fuel pump is measured bythe EKP 
controller. The amperage reading helps determine the rotational speed ofthe pump. 

The rotational speed is transmitted to the microprocessor, which calculates the delivery 
volume ofthe pump. The actual delivery volume is compared to a set of pre-determined 
values. The fuel pump speed in then regulated using these comparisons. 

Fuel Cutoff After Collision 

If the ISIS system detects a crash of sufficient severity, the fuel pump is shut down to pre- 
ventthe potential offire. The fuel pump can be re-activated by switching the ignition off 
and on.

Emergency Call, US 

Starting with the introduction of the E60, the vehicle is 
capable emergency call functions as well as a break¬ 
down call. The emergency call functions available 
include the manual emergency call as well as the 
automatic emergency call in the event of a crash. 

Even if no telephone has been ordered, every vehicle 
has aTelematic Control UnitTCU, a telephone aerial, a 
hands-free unit. TheTCU is now GPS capable with 
electronics for locating the vehicle. 

In orderforthe E65 to be capable of emergency calls, 
the vehicle must have the handset installed. 

Manual Emergency Call 

The emergency call switch is connected directly to the 
TCU. Pressing the emergency call switch sets up a 
voice connection with the provider "Cross Country." 

The voice connection is indicated by a flashing LED in 
the switch. 

Automatic Emergency Call 

In the event of a crash with corresponding crash severity, the SIM transmits a crash 
telegram to the TCU (via the K bus). The Global Positioning System informs the TCU of 
the location of the vehicle. TheTCU places an emergency call, which at the same time 
contains the location of the vehicle. 

A voice connection is setup with the provider "Cross Country" to obtain more informa¬ 
tion on the accident (severity of the accident, number of injured) so that rescue opera¬ 
tions can be initiated. 

Breakdown Call 

The Breakdown call button is in the Central Information Display. Selection can be activat¬ 
ed by means of the controller. If the breakdown call button is activated, a connection to 
the BMW Emergency Service of the relevant country is set up.
