MRS Systems 

MRS was introduced as an enhancement of the existing ZAE system. The main 
improvement was the addition of side airbags with side impact sensors. Also, subse¬ 
quent versions of MRS introduced such new technology as Head Protection Systems, 
Battery Safety Terminal, 2 Stage (SMART) airbags and laterthe introduction of the curtain 
airbag on the E83. 


E39 with MRS II 



MRS I 

The first version of M RS (M RS I) was introduced with the E39 in March of 1996 and also 
added to the E38. This system was the first BMW passive safety system to use side 
airbags with remotely mounted side impact sensors. M RS I remained in use on some 
models until 9/97 production.

TGftJ 3S 



MRS II 

This system was introduced into production vehicles from 5/97 until 9/99. The Head 
Protection System (HPS) became a standard feature and the option of rearside airbags 
were also made available. The 2-Stage passengerside airbag was added in September 
of 1998 and the Safety BatteryTerminal (SBK/BST) was also added to protect the vehicle 
from short circuits to the main battery cable.

MRS III 

The 2-stage driver's airbag was one of the new items to be introduced with MRS III. 
Another new innovation was the connection of the MRS module to the K-bus for diagno¬ 
sis and output of the "crash signal". The K-bus connection also allows the M RS III sys¬ 
tem to send a fuel pump cutoff signal to the DM E. The only exception is the Z3 (E36/7) 
which does not use the K-bus.

MRS IV 

April of 2001 saw the introduction of M RS IV to the E46 and E53. M RS IV was later 
phased into production on the E38 and E39 from 8/01. The primary change was intro¬ 
duction of a modified processor with upgraded software for triggering algorithms. 
Otherwise, all of the features and functions from M RS III are carried over to M RS IV.

MRS 4RD 

The designation "RD" stands for Redesign of the MRS 4 System. The control module 
has been upgraded to 75 pins to accommodate new systems and interfaces. 

The MRS 4RD system has been optimized with new "up-front" sensors, door compres¬ 
sion sensors and b-pillarsatellites. 

The system also incorporates the new OC-3 Seat occupancy detection system which 
was introduced on the E60. This system has the capability to automatically turn off the 
passenger side airbag by detecting the approximate weight and size of the occupant.

• Introduced on the E83 (2004) 

• 75 Pin Control Module with integrated acceleration sensors on X and Y axis. 

• Control Module is coded/programmed via CIP 

• Utilizes door pressure sensors 

• Up-front sensors 

• B-pillar satellites 

• OC-3 Passengerseat occupancy detection with "Passenger Airbag OFF" indicator

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 







Components 


Control Module 


The M RS control module is centrally located within the vehicle, usually underthe center 
console or rear seat. It contains the crash sensing elements as well as the triggering 
electronics. The MRS module is also capable of storing up to 10 faults and can be diag¬ 
nosed through TXD or K-Bus (depending upon version). 


MRS Control Module 

(MRS III Shown) 



The M RS control unit is responsible forthe following functions: 

• Crash Identification 

• Crash evaluation and triggering of relevant output devices (pyrotechnic devices) 

• Performing Self-Check and System Fault Detection 

• Display and storage of faults in Non-Volatile M emory (up to 10 faults stored) 

• Fault diagnosis through diagnostic link (D-bus,TXD, RXD) (K-Bus from M RS III) 

• Control of operation of the Airbag Warning Light (AWL) 

• Vehicle specific coding(through ZCS, CIP) 

• Activation of crash output signal 

• Fuel Pump Cutoff (from M RS III) 


18 

M ultiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 












All M RS control modules contain internally mounted crash sensors. There are 2 piezo- 
electronic accelerometers and 1 mechanical sating sensor.The accelerometers are 
mounted on the circuit board and offset by 90 degrees. Each accelerometer is posi¬ 
tioned 45 degrees from the vehicle centerline which, in combination with the side airbags 
sensors, allows for 360 degrees of monitoring capability. The only exception is the 
M RS 4RD control unit in which the accelerometers are mounted at 0 and 90 degrees 
from the centerline of the vehicle. 

The mechanical sating sensor uses a small weight which is counteracted by a spring. 
During an impact, the weight overcomes the spring and makes contact to signal an 
impact. When an impact is detected by the accelerometers, the airbags will only be 
deployed if the safing sensor has been triggered.

The airbag module also contains capacitors for energy reserve in the event of power loss 
during a collision. There are 2 sets of capacitors in use. One set is used forthe control 
module energy reserve and the other is used forthe airbag ignition circuit. 


The airbag module is capable of storing up to 10 faults in a non-volatile fault memory. Up 
to 3 impacts can be detected, after which the module will store a non-erasable fault code. 
Once 3 impacts have been detected, the module must be replaced. 

Note: Be sure to code the module after installation.

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 






















Airbag Module Summary 

Airbag modules between systems are not 
interchangeable due to hardware and software 
differences. M ost of the early systems use a 
50-pin control module, but use different color 
connectors. 

The MRS 4RD system uses a 75-pin module 
due to additional sensors and peripheral com¬ 
ponents. Also, the internal acceleration sen¬ 
sors are configured differently. They are 
installed at 0 and 90 degrees from the vehicle 
centerline. 

Airbag modules should be installed with the 
directional arrow facing the front of the vehicle 
unless otherwise noted. Be sure to observe 
propertorque specifications during installation.

Note: When servicing airbag systems, always disconnectthe battery before attempt¬ 
ing any repairs. On vehicles produced before 9/93, disconnect battery and wait 
at least 30 minutes before starting work. On vehicle produced from 9/93 to pre¬ 
sent, disconnect battery and wait at least 1 minute before starting work.

Side ImpactSensor 

In orderto record side impacts, the MRS system employs a pair of lateral acceleration 
sensors referred to as MRSA. These sensors are piezo-electric (accelerometers) sensors 
which are mounted perpendicularto the centerline of the vehicle. Usually underthe front 
seat supports or mounted in the b-pillar area. 

Depending upon application, the side airbag sensors are made by Bosch orTemic. They 
are not interchangeable. 



On M RSI and M RS 2 systems the side airbag sensors were manufactured byTemic. 
The connector has 3 pins, one for ground (KL31), one for power (KLR), and the third pin 
was forthe crash signal to the M RS module.

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 




























M RS3 and M RS 4 system used Temic or Bosch sensors. These sensors are not inter¬ 
changeable and must be matched with the airbag module in use. (i.e. Bosch module 
uses Bosch side airbag sensor etc.) These sensors used only a two wire configuration. 
This configuration consists of a ground connection between the sensor and the module, 
the power supply comes from the module and the signal is transposed overthe power 
supply wire. 



MRS Module 

(MRS III/MRS IV) 


22 

M ultiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 



















B-Pillar Satellite (MRS 4RD Only) 

The M RS 4RD system does not use the con¬ 
ventional M RSA side airbag sensors as used 
on the previous M RS systems. The satellites 
are mounted nearthe b-pillararea ratherthan 
underthe front seats. 

The satellites contain lateral as well as longitu¬ 
dinal acceleration sensors. These sensors are 
capable of detecting impacts from the side as 
well as front and rear. 

The left are right side sensors are the same, 
the only difference is in the installation. When 
installed one sensor is directed at the front and 
right side, the other is directed at the left and 
rear. 

DoorPressure Sensors (MRS 4RD only) 

In addition to the b-pillar sensors, door pressure sensors have been added. This 
concept, first introduced on the E65, is used to measure the pressure inside the door 
cavity. In a side impact, the door skin is forced inward in turn reducing the volume. This 
decrease in volume results in a sudden pressure increase. 




This pressure increase is measured by the door pressure sensor and converted to an 
electrical signal. This signal is passed to the M RS 4RD control module. The control 
module processes this information along with the corresponding data from the b-pillar 
satellite. The MRS module activates the appropriate restraint components based on this 
information. 


23 

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 







Up-Front Sensors (MRS 4RD Only) 

The new up-front sensors are used on the M RS 4RD system. The first use of the up¬ 
front sensor was on the E60, laterthe E83 adopted the new sensortechnology. The 
sensors are located on the cooling module assembly above the longitudinal subframe 
members. 



They are used for early detection of frontal impacts. The sensor contains a longitudinal 
acceleration sensor, a signal converter and a microprocessorfordata transmission. 

The up-front sensors are supplied with power via a current-signal interface. The sensors 
are supplied with a current of 5-10mA. When a data message is transmitted, the level 
increases by approximately 20mA 

The advantage of the current signal interface is its constant supply of current which pre¬ 
vents the corruption of the signal. A change of resistance in the circuit does not affect 
the signal. 

Note: After an impact in which the airbags have been deployed, the up-front 
sensors must be replaced. The sensors could be damaged internally, 
even though no external damage is apparent. Always comply with repair 
manual instructions when replacing the up-front sensors. 


24 

M ultiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 



Seat Occupancy Detection (all except E83) 

The Seat Occupancy Detection System (SBE), as introduced on ZAE, is continued with 
MRS systems. The SBE system monitors the front passenger seat for occupants. This 
information is used by the MRS module to determine airbag activation thresholds. 

The SBE system consists of a pressure sensitive resistance mat which is incorporated 
into the passenger seat cushion. 



The SBE module is located underthe passenger seat. The analog signal from the SBE 
mat is converted by the SBE module to a digital signal. This signal is sent to the M RS 
module via a dedicated signal line. The signal is an "occupied" or 'unoccupied" message 
to MRS. 



25 

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 




The SBE module sends an digital signal to the M RS module. This signal is dependent 
upon the status of the front passengerseat (occupied or unoccupied). There is also a 2 
minute time delay when the seat becomes unoccupied. This ensures that the airbag will 
be deployed in the event of a passenger briefly moving off of the seat. 



SensorMat SBE Module 


Seat Occupant Detection OC-3 (E83) 


The need to differentiate between the size 
and weight of the front passenger has brought 
about the development of the new seat occu¬ 
pancy detection system. The new system 
designated "OC-3" (Occupant Classification 
3) is capable of determining the approximate 
size and weight of the passenger. 

This is accomplished by using a force sensi¬ 
tive resistance matsimilarto the previous mat 
already in use. The OC-3 mat however, uses 
4 "resistance zones" which will monitorthe 
concentration and distribution of weight. 

The distance between the concentration of 
weight indicate whetherthe occupant is small 
or large. An algorithm computes the weight 
class and decides whetherthe seat is occu¬ 
pied by a person or by a child seat. 





26 

M ultiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 






























The OC-3 mat is connected to an electronic analyzer which is capable of analyzing the 
information from the resistance mat. 

The electronic analyzer is supplied with ground (KL31) and powerfrom KLR. A data line 
is used to send digital information to the M RS module. On the E83, the electronic 
analyzer communicates with the M RS control module via the K-Bus

Airbag Warning Lamp (AWL) 

On MRS systems, the AWL is used to warn the driver of faults 
within the airbag system. Each time terminal R (KLR) is switched 
on, a self test is performed of the internal circuits of the M RS mod¬ 
ule. Also, the peripheral components (airbags/sensors etc.) are 
checked as well. 

Once this self test is complete (3-4 seconds), the airbag warning 
lamp goes out. Once the AWL is off, the system is ready to deploy 
the airbags when needed. 

The system is continuously monitored from the time KLR is switched on. If a fault occurs 
within the system, the AWL is illuminated and a relevantfault is stored. The AWL will stay 
illuminated (with KLR) until the fault is rectified and fault memory is erased. 

The AWL circuit is supplied with with powerfrom KLR/KL15 and the M RS control unit 
controls the ground side ofthe circuit to activate the LED in the cluster.

Airbag Wiring and Connectors 

All pyrotechnic components are fitted with a shorting bridge on all plug connectors. This 
prevents pyrotechnic devices from being accidentally discharged during service work. 
The shorting bridges create a short circuit across the pins which eliminate the possibility 
of a voltage potential between the two pins.

During service, when the diagnostic test plan requires a resistance measurement, it is 
very important to use the correct test cable. This ensures that the shorting bridges are 
opened. Failure to do so would result in incorrect resistance measurements. 

Test cables can be found in special tools (SWZ) in group 61 and 62. 

Be aware that the wiring forthe side airbag(s) goes through the A-pillar (b-pillar rear) for 
the firing circuit. This area is susceptible to intermittent connection concerns due to the 
movementfrom opening and closing ofthe door. 


B-PillarConnector E46 


Note: When diagnosing a side airbag igniter circuit, always take into account 
the condition ofthe wiring, terminals and connector. These items should 
be checked first before replacing any components (i.e. Airbag or MRS 
Module). 

The best way to diagnose this circuit is to perform a wire test (preferred) ora resistance 
check. The A-pillarconnectorshould be manipulated (wiggled)to check for intermittent 
open connections. 

Repair kits are available forthe door wiring harness and vehicle harness. 

Always check the available Service Information such as Service bulletins and measures 
as well as the latest repair instructions.

Battery Safety Terminal 

The Battery SafetyTerminal (BST) was added to the vehicle electrical system with M RS II 
systems. Since the battery is located in the rear of the vehicle, there is a considerable 
amount of unprotected (unfused) cable running from front to rear. The BST is used to 
protect from short circuit to the B +cable in the event of a severe impact. 


5BHE 



Upon impact the BST will disconnect the B + cable to the starter and alternator. However 
the power will remain connected to the power distribution circuits. These circuits are 
fused and notin danger of an unprotected short circuit. These circuits will remain active 
after an impact to allow operation of other systems such as power locks, windows and 
hazard lighting.

M ultiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 




















The BST consists of a conventional battery 
cable terminal which is modified to contains a 
hollow discharge tube. 

One end ofthe discharge tube contains a 
small igniter pellet made from a solid propel¬ 
lant. attached to the B + battery terminal. 

The battery cable end has a tapered (conical) 
connection which is pressed into the battery 
terminal at the opposite end ofthe discharge 
tube. 

The BST housing is enclosed in a plastic 
housing which protects itfrom damage. The 
plastic housing contains two plastic spring 
tabs. 

The spring tabs will catch and retain the bat¬ 
tery cable connection after deployment. This 
ensures no accidental contact between the 
battery cable and the B +terminal. 

Upon deployment, the igniter pellet is trig¬ 
gered by the MRS control module. The 
resulting gas that is discharged forces the 
tapered end ofthe B +cable to separate from 
the battery terminal. 

Once the battery cable is separated, the plas¬ 
tic spring tabs will retain the cable. 

Once the separation is complete, the starter, 
alternator and battery cable are now isolated 
from battery power. 

The remainder ofthe vehicle electrical system 
is still powered. The power distribution cen¬ 
ters are still connected to the battery terminal 
via a cable. 

During a frontal impact the BST is deployed 
with the front airbags. In a rear impact the 
BST is deployed at the same time as the seat 
belt tensioners. If a side impact is detected, 
the BST is trigger along with the side and 
head airbags.

Drivers Airbag 

The driver airbag,which is mounted on the steering wheel, consists of a tightly folded 
inflatable cushion constructed of nylon and plastic. 

The early airbag systems used a single stage airbag which was deployed by using an 
ignition squib to ignite a small amount of propellant. This propellant expands, filling the 
airbag assembly. The airbag deploys by tearing the airbag cover at pre-determined "frac¬ 
ture lines". The ignited propellant exits the rear of the airbag assembly after being 
cleaned and cooled through a metal filter in the airbag housing. 




2-Stage airbag front view 


2-Stage airbag rearview 


The current airbag systems, which have been in use since the 1998 model year, use a 2- 
stage (Smart) airbag which uses the "cold gas" inflation method. The 2-Stage driver's 
side airbag was introduced in March of 1999. 

The 2-stage airbag assembly consists of an accumulator/gas generator assembly with 2 
ignition capsules. Upon deployment, an inert gas mixture is used to inflate the airbag to a 
capacity of approximately 64 liters. 

The use of two ignition stages, coupled with the lowervolume and new propellant, opti¬ 
mizes the deployment of the airbag and makes it less aggressive when the airbag inflates. 


Note: Airbags do not replace conventional safety restraints (seatbelts). When 
handling an airbag, always place the airbag with the emblem side up. 


36 

M ultiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 




Airbag Contact Ring 

In orderto maintain contact between the 
driver's side airbag and the M RS control 
unit when the steering wheel is turned, a 
special device was developed. This 
device is referred to as the contact ring. 

The contact ring consists of a loosely 
wound coil of flat ribbon cable. 

This arrangement allows the steering 
wheel to turn approximately 3-4 turns from 
lock to lock and still maintain the airbag 
ignition circuit connection. The horn cir¬ 
cuit and M F L signals are also routed 
through separate circuits in the ribbon 
cable. 

Note: When servicing the vehicle it is important notto turn the contact ring 
beyond its maximum number of turns, this can result in a broken ribbon 
cable. For instance, any work involving the steering column. 

Extra care should betaken to ensure the steering wheel is notturned 
with the steering rack disconnected. This situation would allow the 
steering wheel to be turned beyond the capability of the contact ring. 
Removing the key completely from the ignition is the best way to prevent 
the steering wheel from being turned inadvertently. Always follow the 
appropriate repair instructions as they pertain to the contact ring assembly.

Passenger Airbag 

Passenger airbags have been standard equipment on BMW vehicles since 1993. J ustas 
with the driver airbag, the passenger side airbag uses an inflatable plastic cushion. One 
difference is that the passenger airbag has a larger inflated volume (105 liters). 

Early passenger side airbags also used single stage inflation until 9/98. The "Cold Gas" 
inflation technique was also used on the 2-stage SMART passenger airbag. The 
SMART passenger side airbag was installed on M RS II equipped vehicles from 9/98. 


2-Stage Passenger Airbag (FrontView) 2-Stage Passenger Airbag (RearView) 



When the front passenger airbag inflates, a flap connected to the dash panel is opened. 
The flap is retained by a strap, then the airbag opens toward the windshield. When fully 
deployed, the airbag rests on the windshield and dashboard panel. 

Side Airbag 

The side airbag is also referred to as the thorax airbag. This is due to the fact the this 
airbag is designed to protect the thorax (chest/torso) region of the occupant. 

The side airbags are mounted on the inner doorframe on the front and (optional) rear 
doors. Deployment of the side airbags is dependent upon the triggering thresholds pro¬ 
grammed in the M RS module. These thresholds are determined from inputs from the 
satellites and internal crash sensors.

Head Protection Systems 

The BMW Head Protection System (HPS) was first used on M RS II systems. It was 
installed on the E38 in May of 1997 and then added to the E39 in September. HPS was 
also added to the E46 (Sedan/Coupe) and the E53 as well. 

The HPS system consists of the Inflatable Tubular Structure (ITS). The ITS is designed 
to protect the head and neck of the occupant in side impacts. Head injuries account for a 
large portion of overall accident injuries. So, the ITS is a natural enhancement of BMW 
Passive Safety Systems. 



LENGTH =■ X 


MOUNT 


IGNITOR 


The ITS is constructed of an outer woven tube with an innertube of polyurethane. The 
woven structure is secured by straps at either end. The straps are secured in the vehicle 
at the A-pillarand beside the grab handle in front of the C-pillar. The volume of the ITS 
airbag is approximately 11 liters. 

The tubular portion of the ITS is always the same size regardless of application. By alter¬ 
ing the length of the retaining straps, it is easy to adapt the ITS assembly in different 
BMW models. 

Upon sufficient side impact, the gas generator in the ITS will be ignited by the M RS mod¬ 
ule. After ignition, the gas flows through a flexible tube and inflates the ITS. The woven 
structure will expand causing the overall length of the ITS assembly to decrease. This 
causes the ITS to exit from the roof and pillartrim. 

The ITS will unfold in a diagonal pattern to protect the occupant. The diagonal arrange¬ 
ment is designed to protect occupants of different sizes. 


39 

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 






















After impact, the ITS is not vented for deflation, it will gradually deflate as the gas cools 
over a period of time. This process occurs slower than the airbags to protect the occu¬ 
pant from secondary impacts or rollover situations. 

The head protection airbags are always activated together with the side airbags on an 
MRS II system. On MRS III systems and later, the passenger side (thorax) bag is not 
deployed if the passenger seat is not detected as occupied. 



Rear H PS 

In addition to front Head Protection, rear HPS optional with the rear side airbag option. 
Rear HPS is available on E38, E39 and E53. 

The rear HPS airbag is a cushion (not an ITS) that is deployed from behind the C-pillar 
trim. The HPS will not be de-activated along with the side airbags from the factory since 
there is no danger to small children sitting out of position. 

A vehicle with rear HPS can be identified by observing the “HPS” tag embossed in the 
C-pillar cover.

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 










Head Airbag (C urtain Airbag) 

On the E83, a new head protection system , the curtain airbag is introduced as standard 
equipment for the first time. It differs from the head protection (ITS) previously used. The 
airbag is now a continuous curtain airbag from the A to C-pillar. 

The system covers the entire side window area between the occupants and the vehicle 
windows and pillar areas. In conjunction with the side airbags in the front and the rear 
doors, it provides optimum protection for all passengers in the event of a side impact. 



The advantages of the system are as follows: 

• Extended coverage area forthe side windows - front and rear 

• Protection against glass splinters and penetrating objects 

• Optimized protective area offering protection for occupants of different sizes 


41 

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 




The curtain is positioned along the line of the roof side member, folded up. It consists of 
a gas generator, two gas nozzles and the curtain. 



In the event of a side collision, the generator is detonated and the gas flows through the 
two gas nozzles into the curtain. Simultaneous inflation of the curtain and the front and 
rear achieves more even deployment.

The attachment of the curtain airbag to the A-pillarand C-pillar pulls it into position. 

Being a sealed system, the curtain airbag retains its shape and strength for several 
seconds.

SeatbeltTensioning Systems 

It has already been proven that 3-point seatbelts offer an unsurpassed level of protection 
during a motor vehicle accident. However, BMW has added some improvements to 
increase the level of safety as well as the comfort level of the occupant. 

In orderto make the seat belt comfortable to wear while driving, the belt must have a suf¬ 
ficient amount of travel to allow movement but the slack must be kept to a minimum. 

This inertia reel is designed to keep a sufficient amount of tension but to lock undercer- 
tain conditions. 

The inertia reel has two independent locking systems that will lock under various driving 
conditions. The two locking systems are: 

• Ball Type Mechanism - The ball type mechanism uses a ball bearing and lever 
mechanism which responds to changes in g-force. During extreme cornering, high 
bank turns, sharp braking and in a collision, the seat belt will be locked in place by 
the toothed wheel in the inertia reel, the toothed wheel is blocked by the ball and 
lever assembly. 

• Centrifugal M echanism - The centrifugal mechanism will lock the seatbelt when it is 
pulled quickly from the reel. This can be demonstrated by jerking the seat belt out 
of the reel quickly, the seat belt should lock immediately and then unlock once the 
belt is released and pulled out slowly. 



Ball Mechanism Centrifugal Mechanism 


43 

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 





























Pyrotechnic SeatbeltTensioners 

The inertia reel mechanism is designed to 
minimize the amount of belt slack, however 
this does not take into account the elasticity of 
the seat belt. Also, the seating position and 
the thickness of the occupants clothing must 
also be considered. 

To counteract these possibilities, BMW has 
installed a pre-tensioning mechanism to 
reduce the slack in the seat belt during an 
impact. 

Once an impact of sufficient severity is detect¬ 
ed, the gas generator in the pre-tensioned will 
tighten the seat belt approximately 55mm. 

This will preventthe occupant from sliding 
under the seatbelt, an effect referred to as 
"submarining". 

This ensures that during an impact, the upper 
body will shift forward which improves the 
effectiveness of the airbag. 

There are 4 types of seat belt pre-tensioning 
devices used in BMW vehicles. On MRS 
equipped vehicles, the pre-tensioners in use 
are the pyrotechnic type. 

The pyrotechnic seat belt tensioned consists 
of a seat belt buckle attached to a steel cable. 
The steel cable is fitted to a piston at the end 
of the cable. The piston is installed in a steel 
tube which contains a small amount of solid 
propellant. 

Upon impact, the propellant is ignited and the 
piston is driven down the tube. This in turn 
pulls the steel cable which pulls the seat belt 
buckle downward. 

After an accident where the pre-tensioners are 
deployed, they must be replaced. 



44 

M ultiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 



Seat Integrated Belt Systems (SGS) 

The SGS system is used on vehicles that do 
not have a b-pillar post. The first vehicle to 
use the SGS seat was the E31. Currently, the 
E46 convertible and the E64 use the SGS 
seat. 

All seat belt attaching points including the 
upper anchor point are integral to the seat 
frame. All of the forces in a collision are 
absorbed by the seat frame and the floorpan. 

The SGS seat allows the best possible seat 
belt geometry in relation to the occupant. 

The seat belt is wrapped tightly around the 
occupant irrespective of seat position and 
body size. This helps reduce the amount of 
free seat belt length and also further reduces 
excessive slack. 

The features of the SGS seat are as follows: 

• All of the seat belt attachment points are 
connected to the seat frame. 

• The inertia reel clamps the seat belt at 
the closest possible point to the occu¬ 
pant. 

• Optimum protection of occupants in the 
event of a collision. 

• Seat belt strap is released when the 
backrest is folded or adjusted. 

• Comfort is maximized by allowing ideal 
body restraint for any seat setting or body 
size. 

• Restricted forward displacement of occu¬ 
pant due to additional seat belt strap ten¬ 
sioner. 

• More protection during rear and side 
impact. 

• No "submarining" effect. 

• Ideal solution forvehicles without b-pillar 



45 

Multiple Restraint Systems (MRS I - MRS 4RD) 










Seat Belt Contacts 

Regardless of seat type ortensioning device used, all seat belt buckles have a switch 
mechanism. The seat belt buckle switch has a dual purpose. The switch reports seat 
belt status to the M RS module forthe purpose of trigger logic. The M RS can then actu¬ 
ate the necessary pyrotechnic devices (e.g. belt tensioner, airbags etc.) 

The seat belt is also used forthe seat belt warning light. This feature will illuminate the 
seat belt warning light if the vehicle is started without the seat belt being fastened. 

Early seat belt mechanisms used a mechanical type switch. Later models adopted a 
hall-effect switch to increase reliability. 

The hall-sensor buckle switch has been in use on most models since M arch of 1997.

Workshop Exercise - Checking Airbag Igniter Circuits 


Using an instructor designated vehicle, check the following airbag circuits: 


Attention: Be sure to disconnect battery before checking airbag igniter cir¬ 
cuits. When servicing vehicles up to 9/93 production, disconnect 
the battery and wait at least 30 minutes before beginning any ser¬ 
vice procedure. On vehicles from 9/93, wait 60 seconds before 
beginning any service work. 

From the MRS module connector, check the resistance of the side airbag circuits. 


What is the observed resistance?_ 

Using the "resistance tool" supplied by the instmctor, apply an increasing amount of 
resistance until the A WL is illuminated. 


What is the minimum resistance required to illuminate the AWL? 


With the increased resistance in place, perform the applicable test module as per 
DISplus/GT-1 instructions. 

What does the test module conclude as the root cause? 


What does the test module state as the correct resistance range for the side airbag 
circuit?

Principle of Operation 

Crash Output Signal 

The Crash Output Signal (CA) is an output of the MRS control module. In the event of an 
impact, various systems will by activated to facilitate access by rescue personnel. The 
door locks (if locked) will be unlocked, the interior lights will be turned on and the hazard 
warning flashers will be activated. 

To accomplish this, the M RS module sends a "crash output" signal (CA) to various sys¬ 
tems within the vehicle. Depending on the vehicle model and system fitted, the crash 
signal will be a 12 volt high/low signal ora bus telegram overthe K-Bus. 

The body electronic system (ZKE III, IV orV) receive the crash signal forthe activation of 
the locks and interior lights. The lighting system (LCM orLSZ) also receives the crash 
signal for activation of the hazard lights.

Fuel Pump Cutoff Circuit 

Beginning with MRS III, the fuel pump operation will be de-activated during an impact for 
added safety. The M RS module sends a "crash message" overthe K-bus. This K-bus 
message is processed by the cluster and sent to the ECM via the CAN bus. 

The ECM interrupts fuel pump operation by de-activating the control circuit of the fuel 
pump relay.

SOS/Emergency Call 

Beginning with the 2004 3 series and the X3, the SOS/emergency call feature can now 
be initiated by the MRS control module via the K-bus. Upon airbag deployment, the 
M RS control module will send a K-bus telegram to the Telematics Control Unit (TCU) to 
send an emergency call. 

The new TCU is equipped with GPS capability that allows the vehicle to be located by 
emergency personnel.

Workshop Hints 


Checking Airbag Resistance 

When checking airbag resistance, always use the correct test cable. This ensures that 
the shorting bridges are disconnected. Failure to do so will result in improper resistance 
readings during testing. 

Repairing Airbag Wiring 

As a general rule, airbag wiring is not to be repaired unless specified in a service bulletin 
or outlined in repair instructions. There are some repair kits available in the parts system. 
These are usually for side airbag ignition circuits. 

Airbag De-activation 

De-activation of Airbags (front and frontside) 

On certain vehicles, it is possible to de-activate the front passenger and front side 
airbags and the rear side airbags upon customer request. 

As far as the de-activation of the front passenger airbag is concerned, referto BMW 
Service Information Bulletin (SIB) B 72 08 97. All ofthe necessary regulations and 
procedures are outlined here. 

To deactivate the passenger side airbags (and rear side airbag), a special code will need 
to be obtained from BMW NA. The "special code" is used in ZCS/FA coding to properly 
de-activate the specified airbags. 

The bulletin also outlines the properforms to be used. The customerwill have to fill out a 
necessary disclaimer/authorization form for this. 

The forms are then faxed to BMW NA via the BMW center. The necessary fax numbers 
are also outlined in the SIB. 

De-activation of Airbags (rear side) 

On some vehicles, the customer may request to have the rear side airbags de-activated 
as well as the rear HPS (not recommended). 

In response to this some vehicles produced from 6/99 (E38, E39 and E65) come from 
the factory with the rear side airbags de-activated and disconnected. 

Therefore in orderforthe side airbags to be active, the customer must fill out the neces¬ 
sary forms and have the rear airbags re-connected and re-activated via coding. 

Referto BMW SIB B 72 03 99, which contains all ofthe necessary procedure.
