Body Shell 


Front Axle Area 

There is a welded fixture in the lower end wall wheel arch area for the screw connection 
of the front axle support. 

Rear Axle Area 

The crossbeam tunnel has a special geometry for mounting the M trailing links and for 
mounting the M exhaust system. An M trailing link is installed as a reinforcement measure 
on the right and left and for mounting the M rear axle stiffening plate. 

Engine Compartment 

There is a M specific holder installed in the engine compartment for the intake silencer 
cylinder 1-4 at the spring-strut support (in direction of travel on right). 

Luggage Compartment 

A holder for the control unit of the regulated rear-axle differential lock (GHAS) is installed 
in the luggage compartment floor in front of the battery. 

Underbody 

There is a stiffening plate and trailing links at the front and rear for reinforcement. The 
front stiffening plate has an opening for the oil drain plug and the oil filter. The one-piece 
engine compartment shielding has ducts integrated at the side for brake cooling. A new 
underbody panelling improves the airflow of the rear axle final drive. New covers in the 
tank area improve the underbody airflow.

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 



Exterior 


Front View 



The bumper has been designed specifically for the M6. The lower area of the bumper 
reduces lift at the front axle. The PDC sensors are painted in the vehicle color. No fog 
lights are installed due to the large air inlets. 

A striking element is the newly designed M radiator grill with its black, paired grill bars, 
which bear the model inscription "M6" (optional with integrated fixture for BMW 
Night Vision). 

The optional adaptive LED headlights are 
introduced in the upper area by a positioning 
light also fed by LED. Their bright white, 3D LED 
light rings are flattened in the upper and lower 
areas. Both the dipping and the high-beam 
headlights are generated from two light rings. 

The LED units serve as light sources, which are 
positioned on a horizontal bridge in their center 
and guide the light into the reflectors at the front. 

The turn indicators in the shape of horizontal 
LED units are integrated below the light rings in 
the headlight assemblies.

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 













Air Ducts 

The air intake duct and the intake silencer, as well as their positioning, are new. The 
sound insulation of the engine compartment lid is also new. Its geometry is adapted 
to the space requirement of the intake silencer. 

M6 air intake duct 



There is a new air duct both for the center radiator package and for the side M-specific 
low-temperature radiator. The lower engine compartment shielding is one-piece for 
stiffness reasons (instead of 3-piece). It includes the exhaust air duct of the engine oil 
cooler and improves aerodynamics. The lower bumper support is plastic (saves on 
weight) and is secured to the M6-specific deformation elements. The shaped element 
in the upper bumper support is adapted to the shape of the M6 bumper panel.

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 




Side View 



Soft Top 

The soft top system remains unchanged from the FI 2 and is described in detail in the 
training material for the FI 2. 



Carbon Fiber Roof 

The carbon fiber roof is standard on the FI 3. 
It is a double contoured design which 
improves aerodynamics. The carbon fiber 
roof is approximately 10 lbs lighter than a 
conventional steel roof found on the FI 3 
650. This lowers the vehicles center of 
gravity. This has a particularly positive effect 
on the vehicle dynamics. 


Exterior Mirror and Sill 

As standard (100% optional equipment) the exterior mirrors are heated and are elec- 
trochromic shaded, have memory and foldable functions and the passenger mirror an 
automatic parking function. The mirror cap at the bottom is designed as standard in 
high-gloss black including the shaft cover. The exterior mirrors have been adapted in 
terms of optical, aerodynamic and aeroacoustic features. 

The side sill (rocker panel) is also aerodynamically designed. 


14 

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 









Front Fender 

The familiar M gills with the integrated side directional lights are mounted on the front 
fenders. 

The coolant expansion tank is located on the left side behind the gill and the windshield 
washing tank on the right. 

The optional side view camera is integrated in the fenders of the wheel arch similar to the 
FI 2/FI 3 production vehicle. 

The front fenders are now wider due to the tire size for the M6. Each fender is widened 
by approx. 20 mm from the standard FI 2/FI 3. The rear quarter panels remain the same 
as the standard FI 2/FI 3. 

Rear Bumper 

The rear bumper is aerodynamically designed. The PDC sensors are painted in the 
vehicle color. The four tail pipes are typical M6 in design. 

The rear diffuser in the rear bumper between the tail pipes and the rear spoiler on the 
trunk lid reduce the rear axle lift. The trunk also incorporates the rearview camera as 
standard and the power tailgate is optional. The FI 3 will come standard with a rear 
trunk mounted spoiler. 



15 

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 





Wheel/Rim Design 

Cast 19" M6 BMW light-alloy wheels in a double-spoke rim styling with mixed tires 
of size 265/40 R 19 at the front and 295/35 R 19 at the rear are fitted as standard. 

Forged 20" M6 wheel rim in a double-spoke rim styling with mixed tires of size 265/35 
R20 at the front and 295/30 R 20 at the rear are also available as optional equipment. 

Underbody 

There is a stiffening plate and trailing links at the front and rear for reinforcement. The 
front stiffening plate has an opening for the oil drain plug and the oil filter. The one-piece 
engine compartment shielding has ducts integrated at the side for brake cooling. A new 
underbody panelling improves the airflow of the rear axle final drive. New covers in the 
tank area improve the underbody airflow. 

Thermal Protection 

New features and heat insulation: 

• The left heat insulation of the center underbody panelling is new. 

• The heat insulation of the fuel tank is new. 

• The heat insulation of the tunnel is new. 

• A special heat insulation of the luggage compartment prevents the luggage com¬ 
partment heating up too much by the exhaust airflow of the rear axle final drive.

Interior 


Cockpit 

For the full leather upholstery (optional equipment), similar to the F10 M5, is covered 
with black Walk Nappa leather at the top and leather Merino in the upholstery color at 
the bottom.

Steering Wheel 

Introducing the newly styled M6 leather mul¬ 
tifunction steering wheel with M gear selec¬ 
tor shift paddles with M switching logic, (left 
for down-shift, right for up-shift). A smaller 
impact absorber with a smaller airbag (which 
satisfies all crash requirements) has been 
installed. The double spoke design of the 
leather wrapped wheel is an excellent new 
element along with the traditional M badging 
and M color stiching. 

The two M mode buttons located in the left 
spoke of the multifunction steering wheel are 
new. The E64 M6 used only one button for 
M mode.

Engine S63B44T0 

The S63B44T0 (TOP) engine (also referred to as the S63 TU) is installed in the FI 2/FI 3 
M6 and is described in a separate training manual. ST1202 S63 TU Engine training 
material is available on TIS and ICR 

GS7D36BG Double-Clutch Transmission 

The GS7D36BG M Double-Clutch Transmission w/Drivelogic is standard in the FI 2/13 
M6. The customer will benefit from the increased efficiency of the gear shifts along with 
reduced fuel consumption in comparison to the previous model. In comparison to the 
GS7S47BG (SMG 3) in the E64 M6, there is no delay between gearshifts. The drive is 
retained continuously. 

This is due to the M Double-Clutch Transmission w/Drivelogic that was first introduced 
in the E9x M3 with the S65B40 engine. 

This reference manual only describes the differences of the GS7D36BG to 
the GS7D36SG.

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 






Transmission changes compared to the M3 GS7D36SG: 

• Adaptation of torque and power through a special processing procedure of the 
gear surfaces. 

• Due to the lower speed range of the S63B44T0 engine, 5th gear is now a direct 
gear and 7th gear is the indirect gear. There is also a change to the 7th position 
in the designation of the transmission. M3 designation GS7D36"S"G (sport) 

Fix M5/M6 designation GS7D36"B"G (Gasoline). 

• All gear sets and the control of the sliding clutches 5/7, have been redesigned. 

• The hydraulic emergency operation is discontinued. In the event of a power failure 
the transmission remains in Neutral. 

• The parking lock automatically engages after approx. 15 minutes after the engine 
has shut off with the gear selector position "N" and ignition "ON" Car wash mode. 

• The transmission oil cooling system is different to that of the M3 with M DCT 
Drivelogic. The coolant/oil heat exchanger and the 95° C (203° F) thermostat are not 
used. The air/oil heat exchanger circuit provides the cooling on its own. The oil 
capacity is approx. 9.5 liters (10 quarts) including the radiator.

Drivelogic 

After changing between seguential mode and Drive mode the last selected 
driving program is active. 

After each engine start, driving program 1 in the Drive mode is always active. 

Drive mode 

Three driving programs are available for selection: 

1. Efficient driving 

2. Relaxed driving 

3. Sporty driving 

Sequential mode 

Three driving programs are available for selection: 

1. Comfortable gear shifts 

2. Sporty, guick gear shifts 

3. Maximum shifting speed and the prereguisite for activation of launch control 
For using the highest, i.e. the third driving program, DSC must not be deactivated. 

Launch Control 

The launch control allows optimal acceleration when starting-off on a dry surface. 


During the first 5,000 km/3,000 miles the launch control should not be 
used.The 2,000 km/1200 mile pre-delivery check must be performed 



I_; and reset/confirmed with ISTA (do not reset via the instrument panel 

service function as the launch control is not released). 


38 

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 



Preconditions 

In order for the launch control to be activated the following pre conditions must be met: 

1. The vehicle must be stationary, the engine running and be at operating temperature 
(approx 10 km/ 6 mile warm-up drive). 

2. The dynamic stability control is deactivated. 

3. The seguential mode and the third Drivelogic driving program are selected. 

4. The brake pedal is pressed gently using the left foot. 

5. The M gear selector switch is pressed forwards in the direction of travel and held 
there for steps 6-8. 

6. In the M instrument panel a flag symbol must appear (if not, check steps 1 -5). 

7. The accelerator pedal is fully pressed and remains pressed. An engine speed of 
approx. 3,500 rpm is set, which can be increased an additional 500 rpm's by using 
the cruse control speed button. 

8. The left foot is then removed off the brake. 

Activation 

Launch control can be activated by releasing the gear selector switch that was pressed to 
the front. The vehicle is then accelerated. 

Effect 

• The launch control starts up automatically using the shortest possible shifting times, 
up to 5th gear as long as the driver keeps the accelerator pedal fully depressed up 
to a maximum time limit of 22 seconds. 

• The start flag icon in the instrument panel remains active during launch control. 

Automatic Deactivation 

• The driver leaves vehicle or the accelerator pedal full load range during acceleration 
or the acceleration phase reaches a duration of 22 seconds. 

• If one of the preconditions are not met launch control is not possible. 

• If the transmission oil temperature is too high (e.g. repeated launch control or 
start-up similar to a race), activation is blocked until the oil temperature is in a 
acceptable range. 

• For each deactivation the start flag goes out and the automatic start-up is cancelled. 

Transmission Control Unit (DCT) 

The DCT control unit is installed in the transmission and is connected to the PT-CAN.

Emergency Release of Parking Lock 

In the event of a power interruption the transmission parking lock 
must be manually unlocked in order to move the vehicle. It can only 
be unlocked if the vehicle is on level ground, it is not recommended 
to unlock the transmission if the incline/longitudinal gradient is > 10°. 
After parking the vehicle the parking lock must be locked again. 

Unlocking 

1. Open cup holder cover at front. 

2. Remove cup holder insert. 

3. Insert a screwdriver in the center hole , push the parking lock lever 
from left to right shown by the arrow below)) to the end position. 

4. The parking lock is unlocked.

Note: This training material discusses the FI 2/FI 3 M6 vehicles but it is 

important to point out that the FI 2/FI 3 M6 is largely based on the FI 0 
M5 and thus shares the same Powertrain, Chassis Suspension, Braking 
and Electrical system.

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 




Gearbox Oil 


For work on the oil circuit of the double-clutch transmission this must be done with 
extreme cleanliness. 

This involves: 

• Cleaning of the outer oil circuit connections before dismantling the components 
or opening the oil circuit 

• Immediate closing of openings and lines after dismantling and using clean original 
plugs. Do not use any unsealed components or spare parts of the oil circuit without 
checking for cleanliness. 

• The work bay at which a DCT is opened must be completely clean and protected 
against dirt and contamination. For example use clean lint-free rags. 

Long-Term Oil Filling 

The Gearbox oil change is currently not reguired at the 2,000 km /1200 mile service or 
at every third engine oil change. 

Repair/Part Replacement 

Depending on the type of repair the data status of the DCT must be read beforehand 
and read again after replacing components (e.g. mechatronics replacement). 

If the twin-clutch assembly is replaced, the gear selector position "Neutral" must be 
selected before shutting down the engine.

Rear Axle Final Drive 


Electrically Activated M lock 

This new electro-mechanically controlled rear-axle differential lock was developed 
especially for the FI 2 M6. 

The new M rear axle final drive is a HAG 220 (ring gear 0 220 mm) with the new M rear 
axle lock is used. The system designation is a regulated rear-axle differential lock, the 
control unit designation GHAS (Regulated Rear Axle Differential lock) is connected to the 
Flex Ray Bus. 

This replaces the variable M differential lock used in the E60 M5 designated HAG 215 
(ring gear 0 215 mm). 

The gear ratio of the HAG 220 is 3.154:1 (HAG 215: 3.615:1). 

The new M rear axle final drive can be identified by the aluminum oil sump installed on 
the differential and the external electric drive motor. 

At 49.7 kg /109 lbs the HAG 220 is about 2.8 kg / 6 lbs heavier than the HAG 215 of the 
E60/E61 M5 or E63/E64 M6. 

Rear axle final drive, external view 



42 

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 



Operation 

The lock is a demand-driven rear-axle differential lock that is active in the following 
situations: 

• Pulling away. 

• Differential speed at the rear axle for straight-ahead driving under 
load due to different coefficients of friction left/right. 

• Dynamic cornering. 

• Heavy oversteering. 

• Stabilization in coasting/decelerating. 

Traction, handling and driving stability are optimized by adjusting a defined differential 
speed or a differential torgue at the rear axle. 

The controlled M rear-axle differential lock works with a position-controlled electric motor 
and a ball ramp. The GHAS control unit is installed in front of the battery in the trunk. 


43 

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 



Design/Function 

The locking torque is generated by a multidisc clutch. The necessary axial pressure is 
applied by a direct current motor by means of gearing and a ball ramp mechanism to the 
multidisc clutch. The clutch pack acts between the differential housing (steel outer discs) 
and the output hub (molybdenum-coated steel inner discs).

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 
















































Function 

The electric motor (1) is screwed on at the housing and the pressure disc is fixed to the 
second ball ramp half (5) in the housing. The movable components of the ball ramp (2, 3 
and 4) generate the necessary axial displacement of the pressure disc (5). These compo¬ 
nents are not subject to the differential gear rotation and are disconnected from the 
rotating components by the axial needle bearing (6). 

The components with the Index 6 to 18 are part of the differential gear and rotate 
proportional to the rear axle wheel speeds. 

The lock acts between the inner output hub (12) and the differential housing (18) and 
counteracts a difference in speed between the output bevel gears (16 and 17). The disc 
spring (11) opens the lock if the engine is not supplied with power. 

System Information 

The GHAS control unit monitors the drive dynamic parameters from other control units 
on the FlexRay data bus and determines the locking torgue to be applied. The DSC con¬ 
trol unit can make and overriding reguests with regard to the differential lock for stabilizing 
the vehicle when the DSC system is activated or deactivated. 

The position-regulated direct current motor is activated directly by the power electronics 
of the GHAS control unit with a pulse-width modulated signal. The freguency is 12.8 kHz 
and the maximum current is 30 A. 

Two hall-effect sensors are used to determine the position and the direction of rotation 
of the electric motor.

Electric Motor Position Identification 

Two hall-effect sensors are installed inside the motor for determining the position of the 
electric motor. 

For determining the characteristic curve of the locking torgue over the motor position, 
a recalibration is regularly carried out to compensate for clutch wear. 

To calculate the clutch locking torgue for a certain position of the servomotor a reference 
run is performed every 1,000 km / 620 miles, at the same time it uses this reference run 
to determine clutch wear. A reference run of the motor is performed by activating the 
motor with a defined amount of current. The locking torgue of approx. 1,500 Nm is 
applied to the clutches. 


49 

FI 2/FI 3 M6 Complete Vehicle 




Temperature Monitoring 

Three temperature sensors are used. They monitor the temperature of the control unit 
(driver final stage), electric motor and the differential oil temperature. 

The following temperature thresholds are listed below: 

Control unit 105 °C/221°F. 

Electric motor 160 °C / 320°F. 

Differential oil temperature 190 °C / 374°F. 

The current oil specification is "BMW final drive oil synthetic MSP/A" (Castrol SAF-XJ) 
and is the same oil in the previous M vehicles with variable M differential lock. 

The capacity of the rear differential is 1.2 liters (1.26 guarts). 


CAUTION!!! 


If the GH AS locking function is switched off due to a 
fault, a locked differential is automatically reopened 
as the locking function is not self-locking. 


The driver is warned/informed and the following is applied: 

• Decreased traction for the dynamic driving style and lower coefficients of friction, 
in particular for different coefficients of friction left/right. 

• Lack of the vehicle stability in dynamic driving situations. 

Service Information 

In the case of a replacement of the GHAS control unit must be coded (activation of a 
vehicle-related characteristic curve) and then an initial calibration is reguired along with 
deleting the fault memory. 

If the complete M rear axle final drive has been replaced a calibration must be 
performed and then the fault memory deleted. 

The fault memory has to be deleted for the replacement of an electric motor, or the oil 
temperature sensor. 

The final drive oil needs to be replaced at 2,000 km / 1200 miles (pre-delivery check) 
and at every third engine oil change. 

Output shafts 

The special feature of the output shafts is the gearing on two sides. They are no longer 
flange-mounted at the rear axle final drive , but inserted in the rear axle final drive and in 
the wheel hub. The procedure for installation and removal has changed. 

Please refer to the Repair Manual in ISTAforthe removal and installation procedures.

VARIOSERV® Power Steering Pump 

A vane-type power steering pump is used for the first time at BMW in the FI x M5/M6. 
The pump efficiency has increased without an electrical control valve. It works with a 
mechanical/hydraulic control of the volumetric flow via an integrated control valve. 


Power steering pump (VARIOSERV®) 



The development of this pump was to 
lower C02 and fuel consumption values. 
Further improvement potential in the 
reduction of the steering oil temperature 
and in protecting the pump against pos¬ 
sible overloading. 

The manufacturer is ZF Lenksysteme. 


Design 

In comparison to the normal vane-type pump, the cam ring (6) of the VARIOSERV® 
pump is adjustable and can generate adjustable flow volume by the varying its position. 
The cam ring is adjusted depending on the speed using the differential pressure 
between the left (8) and right chamber (4). A control valve (3) installed traverse to the 
shaft (13) with integrated pressure control that determines the function. 

Function 

After achieving the pump speed at engine idle speed the pump conveys a constant 
volumetric flow. An increasing change in speed leads to the fact that the internally rising 
pump pressure opens the control valve, exposes the cam ring and reduces the eccentric¬ 
ity for the rotor (7). The smaller pump spaces only create a reduced volumetric flow. This 
limited pumping ability prevents an overproduction of oil pressure and leads to a signifi¬ 
cantly reduced energy consumption at higher pump speeds through the reduced power 
consumption. There is also the option of reducing the cooling measures in the steering 
system. 

In the event of decreasing engine speed, the pressure gap between the left and right 
chamber enlarges the area between the rotor and the cam ring. As a result the oil 
volume rises again.

Servotronic 


This is the first M Servotronic which has three selectable stages and its own button in the 
drive dynamic button area in the center console. The stages can be switched between 
"Comfort", "Sport" and "Sport plus". This can be done by using the button on the center 
console or the configuration menu in the CID. The corresponding characteristic curve is 
activated. In the "Sport" position the power steering support is noticeably harder. The 
program selection can also be preconfigured in the M Drive menu and selected via the 
M button (Ml or M2) on the steering wheel. 

The servotronic control unit SVT is installed in the luggage compartment (installation 
location for space reasons). It receives the control valve signals from the DME and 
functions as a power output stage. 

While the DME1 is the primary DME, a ground signal is sent from the Servotronic button 
to the DME2. The communication between DME and SVT is sent via the PT-CAN. The 
Servotronic button receives the ground signal from the Integrated Chassis Management 
control unit ICM. 

All drive dynamic buttons except the engine dynamic button are sent to the ICM.

Front brake 



The front brakes are specific to the 
FI 2/FI 3 M6. It uses a large ventilated 
M Compound brake discs combined 
with a six-piston fixed calipers. In 
comparison to the FI 2/FI 3 650i, 
the diameter of the front brake disc 
@ 15.7 inches is 1.02 inches larger. 

All brake calipers on the FI 2/FI 3 M6 
are painted blue. 


The rear ventilated M Compound brake disc @ 15.5 inches is 2 inches larger in diameter 
than the FI 2/FI 3 650i disc. The rear brake caliper, including the electromechanical park¬ 
ing brake EMF, was taken from the FI 2/FI 3 650i. The single-piston floating caliper is also 
painted blue. 

The characteristic maps of DSC and EMF are specific to M. 

Brake Pad Wear Sensors 

The M6 only has one brake pad wear sensor on the left front brake pad and one on the 
right rear pad.

Driving Stability Control Systems 

The M-specific setting of the driving dynamics (longitudinal, transverse and vertical) was 
tested at the Nurburgring Nordschleife (Northern Loop), along with other locations. 

Vertical Dynamics Management 

The EDC function is integrated in the M Vertical Dynamics Management control unit 
M VDM which controls the adjustable dampers. 

The suspension can be controlled by the driving dynamics selector button in the center 
console. The program selection can also be preconfigured in the M Drive menu and 
selected by pressing the corresponding M button (Ml or M2) at the steering wheel. 

Electronic damper control 

There are no EDC satellites installed at the shock absorbers, only M specific control 
valves are installed. The shock absorbers have been developed with the supplier ZF 
Sachs and the system is adapted to the Fix M5/M6 vehicles. 

The EDC works with infinitely variable valves in the dampers. The hydraulic oil flow is 
regulated by the electromagnetic control valves. This makes it possible to provide the 
damping force reguired at all times. 

Control variables such as the front wheel speeds, steering angle, body movements and 
damper piston speed have been modified to corresponding control variables. 

In addition, the vertical acceleration between the suspension and body is monitored by 
the ride height sensors of the headlights. There is one ride height sensor installed at the 
front left and one at the rear left. They are potentiometer's and their signals are hard 
wired to the Integrated Chassis Management control unit. The ICM sends these signals 
over the FlexRay data bus to the M Vertical Dynamics Management (EDC) control unit 
M VDM.

EDC Button Selection 

The EDC button receives a ground signal from the ICM and forwards it back to the 
ICM when activated. The ICM forwards this information over the FlexRay data bus to 
the M VDM. 

The selection options for damper control are "Comfort", "Sport" and "Sport+". All three 
programs have dynamic control in the Fix M5/M6 vehicles. 

Program description 

• "Comfort" emphasizes a comfortable design in order to meet the comfort 
reguirements of M5/M6 customers. The dampers are set to a comfortable setting. 

• "Sport" supports a dynamic and sporty driving style with a increased 
damper hardness. 

• "Sport+" supports a dynamic control in which the damper hardness 
is raised further in comparison to "Sport". 

Transverse Dynamics Management 

The Integrated Chassis Management ICM is the main control unit for the transverse 
dynamics system. The ICM control unit controls the interaction between the Servotronic, 
DSC and the regulated rear-axle differential lock GHAS. 

Longitudinal Dynamics Management 

The longitudinal dynamics management is controlled by the Dynamic Stability 
Control (DSC). 

M Dynamic Mode and DSC OFF Mode 

In the M Dynamic Mode MDM, the control threshold of the brake interventions is 
delayed and the engine power is reduced by DSC considerably later. This allows 
for a more sport oriented drivability. 

Using the driving dynamics button "DSC" or the configuration in the M Drive menu in the 
CID, the driver can switch between DSC ON, MDM and DSC OFF. The button receives 
its ground from the ICM and forwards a ground signal when actuated back to the ICM. 
The ICM forwards this information via the FlexRay data bus to the DSC. 


Note: This training material discusses the FI 2/FI 3 M6 vehicles but it is 

important to point out that the FI 2/FI 3 M6 is largely based on the FI 0 
M5 and thus shares the same Powertrain, Chassis Suspension, Braking 
and Electrical system.
