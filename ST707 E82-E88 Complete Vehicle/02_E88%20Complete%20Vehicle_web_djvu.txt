Introduction 


Similar to the legendary BMW 2002, the 
1 Series inspires feelings of nostalgia. With 
the innovations in automotive technology 
and safety along with the experience gath¬ 
ered over the many years of vehicle devel¬ 
opment, one can only imagine the car that 
BMW would build today in honor of such 
automotive legacy. 


Inspired by past 2002 models of the sixties and seventies BMW has designed a vehicle 
combining rear-wheel-drive, excellent handling and powerful engines with the stiffest and 
lightest bodyshell possible along with accommodations for four. The 1 Series Coupe 
picks up where the 2002 left off. 




With the 1 Series convertible, BMW succeeded in taking the typical sports coupe to the 
next level. To the already fun inspiring and performance oriented theme of the E82, 
designers added the free spirited look and feel that all past BMW convertibles models 
share. Both the E88 and E82 vehicles will be available as 128i and 135i. 



The E88’s design was influenced by the E93, both cars share similar features and 
systems. Although they are both convertibles, the difference between the E93 and E88 
is mainly that the E93 is considered a retractable hardtop convertible and the E88 is a 
soft top design. There are also noticeable differences in the exterior, interior and in the 
luggage compartment. The front bodywork, rear section, doors and bumpers have been 
adapted from the E82. 

Note: Dependent on the market/state, the 128i is available with the 
N51B30M0 SULEV engine on both the E82 and E88 versions. 


5 

E88 Complete Vehicle 























The 1 Series Convertible is a four-seater vehicle with a fully automatic fabric convertible top 

The 128i is powered by the N51B30M0 SULEV engine or the N52B30O1, 230 horse¬ 
power inline 6-cylinder 3.0-liter engine that generates 200 Ib-ft of torque; the 128i will 
feature Valvetronic, VANOS and aluminum/magnesium block construction. The 128i can 
be visually identified by the two oval tail pipes with chrome tips at the lower left of the rear 
bumper. 

The 135i features the N54B30U0 twin-turbocharged direct injection 3.0-liter inline six- 
cylinder engine that produces 300 horsepower and 300 Ib-ft of torque from as low as 
1,400 rpm. The 135i can be visually identified by the two 80 mm diameter tail pipes with 
chrome tips as standard equipment along with the M aerodynamic package. 

Conforming to BMW’s Efficient Dynamics, these vehicles will include the following: 

• Light weight but rigid bodyshell. 

• Lightweight suspension components: 

example: hollow anti-roll bars and aluminum front axle. 

• Run Flat Tires as standard equipment.

The bodyshell is fully galvanized and composed of a variety of steel grades. High-tensile 
steels and specially designed bracing concepts ensure the bodyshell is extremely rigid 
and stable. 

Rigidity is increased with the use of a convertible-specific bracing package that reinforces 
the front section and trunk area in combination with a specially design sill/rocker beam 
component. 

The front section bracing system links are connected using 4 special brackets incorporat¬ 
ed into the bodyshell and a mounting fixture on the front axle carrier. 

The front axle carrier and front section components are bridged providing additional rigidi¬ 
ty to the frame rails. Three pairs of brace struts are combined to create a spatial frame¬ 
work which provides optimum bracing for the front section, while adding minimum weight 
to the vehicle.

Exterior Sill/Rocker Structure 

The sill/rocker structure represents the principle load path from the front section to the 
rear. To provide rigidity against bending and torsion forces, a horizontal flange has been 
added between the inner and outer sill/rocker beam shell. The sill/rocker structure is addi¬ 
tionally reinforced with the incorporation of transverse reinforcing components.

Partition Wall Module 

Additional bracing has been incorporated into the rear section, as in previous convert¬ 
ibles. The partition wall is designed as an assembly module which provides structure with 
only minimal vehicle weight gain. The main support is also transmitted through the parti¬ 
tion wall reinforcement struts, offering a weight bearing advantage.

Strut Brace Concept 

The underbody strut braces along with the sill/rocker beam structure secure the front and 
rear sections of the under body while reinforcing the lower rocker assemblies. The entire 
concept is designed to work together with the modular partition wall and the front strut 
bracing assembly to meet the E88’s requirements for structure rigidity and crash safety 
standards.

Front Section Body work 

The the design of the E88 front body work meets the requirements for the US market 
while accommodating the current top of the line N54B30 engine (in the135is) within the 
established dimensions of the 1-Series body. 

The design front section features: 

• Slightly different bumper trim from the E82. 

• Extends the range of engines available between the N54B30U0, N51B30M0 and 
N52B30O1. 

• Integration of front strut braces (inspired by E93) to increase the rigidity of the 
front section of the body. 

• Accommodates the front section components, front axle components, front bumper 
cover, radiator support and cooling module (including an additional cooler for the top 
of the line N54B30 engine).

Dashboard Module 



Dashboard module features: 

• 2-piece driver’s footrest 

• The design and arrangement of the dashboard components 
(start/stop, light switch cluster, etc.) 

• Electric steering column lock (not on manual gearshift vehicles) 

• Steering column adjustment lever located to the side 
(out of the range of knee impact). 

Note: The vehicle also incorporates active knee protection airbags for 
both the driver and passenger.

Luggage Compartment 

The luggage compartment offers the customer versatility, while providing for convenient 
location and logical arrangement of the control modules. 

Volume/loading 

In order to provide the customer with the largest cargo room possible, a variable roof 
storage compartment has been incorporated, as on the E46/C. When the convertible 
roof is stowed the available cargo room is 260 liters, with the convertible top up the 
cargo room increases by 40 liters to a maximum of 300 liters; this is the same as the 
maximum cargo capacity of the E46/C. 

The total volume of the trunk is not only impressive in numbers, but also very practical in 
function. With the convertible top open, the vehicle can be loaded with two 46" golf bags. 
This can also equate to one large and one small suitcase. 

The use of the modular partition wall created a larger through-loading opening (option) 
compared to the E46/C. Two snowboards or at least three pairs of skis can be loaded 
through this opening.

Convertible Top 


The convertible top is 20 mm shorter and the top storage compartment is 20% smaller 
than on the E46/C. 

The use of a sound-absorbing material for the convertible top makes it possible to 
reduce noise levels in the vehicle and also compensates for aerodynamic disadvantages 
caused by the rounded shape of the top. 

The thickness of the rear window is now 3.8 mm instead of 3.25 mm. This allows levels 
of low-frequency noise to be reduced considerably. 

Significant improvement of the "top down" sensation has been achieved by locating the 
windshield frame and sun shades forward when compared to the E46/C. The sun 
shades are 1.92” further forward than on the E46/C.

• A classic fabric convertible top with storage compartment cover /lid. 


• First time that "anthracite" color has been used on production vehicles (silver effect). 


• Top lining is similar as the top on the E46/C. 

• Fully functional while the vehicle is in motion, top operation starts at speeds up to 
approximately 30 km/h (19 mph) and continues up to 40 km/h (25 mph). 

• The frameless rear window is bonded in with adhesive to the top material. It cannot 
be replaced separately. 


• Variable top storage compartment to increase the loading volume when the top 
is closed.

Top Opening and Closing Procedure 

Fully automatic opening and closing of the top takes 22 seconds 
(not counting windows operation time). 

Once the convertible top is fully closed, the side windows are actuated. 
Opening/closing - from inside the vehicle: 

• Using the switch on the center console (also actuates the windows) 

Opening/closing - from outside the vehicle: 

• Using the door lock (also actuates the windows) 

• Up to 4 m/13 ft remote control radius, in conjunction with Comfort Access 
(also actuates the windows) 

• At a distance greater than 4m/13ft, only opens via remote control. 

(also actuates the windows).

Layout of the Hydraulic Control Unit 

The hydraulic pump is located in the right side section of the trunk. 

The benefits of this location are: 

• Maximum distance between the pump and the driver for noise suppression. 

• Hydraulic lines are easily concealed by the luggage compartment trim. 

• Ease of accessibility for service and repair.

Top Storage Compartment Cover 

Notable features of the top storage compartment lid/cover are: 

• The top storage compartment lid is made from sheet metal. 

• There is a concealed trim panel on the top storage compartment lid. 

• The side trim panel overlaps with the metal panel to provide anti-trap function. 

• Seam width from the top storage compartment to the side panel is reduced to 
3.5 mm.

System Components 


Convertible Top 

The electrohydraulic convertible top can be opened and closed fully automatically. 

Opening or closing the convertible top takes approximately 22 seconds. If necessary it 
may also be activated when moving at low speeds (up to 40 km/h or 25mph). 

This involves moving the convertible top by means of a hydraulic cylinders. An electric 
motor unlocks the convertible top from and locks it to the windshield cowl. 

After it has opened, the convertible top is stored in the top storage compartment. The top 
storage compartment lid then closes automatically. The convertible top can be operated 
via 2 buttons in the center console switch cluster.

Position Sensors and Microswitches 

The sensors for the convertible top module (CVM) are composed of: 

• 8 Hall sensors supply signals to the convertible top module (CVM). The CVM moni¬ 
tors these sensors and determines the position of the convertible top. 

• 1 microswitch to determine trunk partition position. 

• 1 incremental sensor is a magneto resistive sensor mounted on the locking motor 
and monitors the locking mechanisms position.

Trunk Partition Microswitch #8 

This microswitch #8 ensures that the trunk partition has been lowered. With the trunk 
partition lowered, the microswitch is connected to ground. If this condition is not fulfilled, 
the convertible top does not open (disabling condition). Located on the left side trunk 
partition catch. 



Note: No short circuit recognition. 

The convertible top module (CVM) will not recognize a short circuit of the wire to the 
microswitch for the detection of the trunk partition. 


Note: When diagnosing and servicing the convertible top, please be aware that 
the terminology may vary between the training material, repair instruc¬ 
tions and diagnostic software version used.

Convertible Top Module (CVM) 

The convertible top module (CVM) controls all the electrical and hydraulic functions of the 
convertible top. The convertible top module is connected to the K-CAN. 

The convertible top module is fitted to the partition wall module. Under certain inhibition 
conditions, the CVM will not activate the convertible top (see system functions, prerequi¬ 
sites for opening and closing the top).

Controls for Operation 

The center console switch cluster has 2 buttons for operating the convertible top (Open 
convertible top and Close convertible top). The center console switch cluster (SZM) is 
connected to the heating/air conditioning controls module. 

Above the two buttons there are a red and a green function LEDs. These LEDs are con¬ 
trolled by the convertible top module (CVM) via the K-CAN. The green LED lights up 
while the convertible top is moving. The red LED starts to flash if the convertible top or 
the top storage compartment lid is not located securely in their end position when the 
button is released. 

The flashing red LED does not denote a fault. The flashing LED is intended to draw 
attention to the fact that the vehicle should not be driven in this state. 

When the convertible top is opened by pressing the button, and there is a disabling con¬ 
dition (like, the trunk partition not lowered) the red LED lights up to signal the fault. 

The two control buttons are each equipped with 2 double contacts (normally open con¬ 
tact against ground). A wire leads directly to the CVM and reports a general operation 
request. The second wire reports the direction to the control unit for the heating/air condi¬ 
tioning system (IHKA). The signal is then transmitted to the CVM via the K-CAN. 

The execution of an operation request takes place after a time delay. If the button is 
released during the operation, the convertible top or side window movement stops imme¬ 
diately.

Convertible Top Hydraulic Circuit Components 

The convertible top hydraulic control unit consists of the electric motor with hydraulic 
pump, fluid reservoir, valve block and relays. The hydraulic control unit powers all the 
movements of the convertible top using 3 cylinder pairs. 

Each cylinder pair controls either: 

• the convertible top main pillars 

• the convertible top roll bar 

• the top storage compartment cover or (lid).

Electrical Hydraulic Control Unit 


The direction of movement of the con¬ 
vertible top (OPEN or CLOSE) is con¬ 
trolled by 2 relays. 

The cylinders are supplied with oil by a 
hydraulic pump with 3 valves and with 2 
directions of flow. A change in direction 
by the hydraulic pump determines the 
direction of movement of the pistons/ 
rams. 



The hydraulic pump with a maximum of 
200 bar is integrated into the hydraulic 
control unit. The two relays and the 3 
hydraulic valves for hydraulic control are also 


integrated into the hydraulic control unit. 


The hydraulic control unit circuit is safeguarded with a slow-acting fuse rated at 50 amp. 
fuse. To protect the hydraulic control unit, a "pump protection feature" is resident in con¬ 
vertible top module (CVM). 



35 

E88 Complete Vehicle 








The hydraulic pump is only operational while the convertible top is in motion. Should the 
pump fail, emergency operation will be necessary. 

The hydraulic control unit is installed in the right side of the luggage compartment. It has 
been placed in the furthest point possible from the driver in order to minimize the sound 
being transmitted into the passenger compartment by the pump during operation.

Windshield Cowl Locking System 

A geared electric motor locks and unlocks the convertible top to and from the windshield 
cowl on the top of the windshield frame. The convertible top module (CVM) actuates the 
drive unit. 

The drive unit is located in the center of the cowl locking system. The right and left side 
catches are moved via a disc and 2 thrust rods. The Hall sensor for the (windshield cowl 
locked) monitors the locking system.

E88 Complete Vehicle 

















The following control modules also contribute to the operation of the convertible top: 

• Instrument cluster (KOMBI) 

The instrument cluster supplies an outside temperature reading (bus signal) and indi¬ 
cates the Check Control messages regarding the convertible top using Check Control 
symbols. 

• Footwell module (FRM) 

The footwell module (FRM) controls the front power windows. To open the convertible 
top, the side windows must be opened (bus signal from the CVM). 

• Junction box electronics (JBE) 

The junction box electronics (JBE) control the rear power windows. To open the convert¬ 
ible top, the side windows must be opened (bus signal from the CVM). 

The junction box electronics supply a signal to indicate whether the trunk lid is closed 
(bus signal). 

The distribution box in the junction box supplies the convertible top module (CVM) via 
terminal 30g. 

The CVM is supplied via terminal 15 of the Car Access System (CAS). If, for example, the 
junction box power supply is interrupted, sufficient communication is still possible with 
the BMW diagnostic system. 

• Car Access System (CAS) 

The CAS stores the power window position or status and makes that information avail¬ 
able to the CVM control module. 

Following a request from the CVM, the CAS controls the opening and closing of the side 
windows. The CAS prevents the trunk lid from opening and any movement of the power 
windows when the convertible top is in an intermediate position. 

The Car Access System (CAS) controls comfort opening of the convertible top. 

The signals from the remote control are received by the FBD receiver and passed on to 
the CAS. 

Comfort opening and comfort closing are controlled via the lock and key in the driver’s 
door: The CAS receives this signal from the footwell module (FRM).

Service Information 


Service Notes 

Consider the following helpful hints when servicing the E88 top: 

• The rear power windows do not have an anti-trap mechanism. There is no one- 
touch control function for closing the rear windows. 

• No comfort closing from the outside door handle electronics. 

On vehicles with Comfort Access, comfort closing cannot be activated from the 
outside door handle electronics. Comfort closing is performed by the driver’s door 
lock and key. 

• Maintenance-free hydraulic fluid. 

Changing the hydraulic fluid is not necessary. If hydraulic fluid needs to be added 
to the system due to leaks, only the approved hydraulic fluid may be used. (See 
operating fluids in TIS). The hydraulic fluid must be filled up only to the mark on 
the fluid reservoir. 

• The hydraulic system is self-bleeding. 

• The convertible top Hydraulic unit and its mechanism are replaced as a complete 
assembly. 


Diagnostic Notes 

Consider the following helpful hints when diagnosing the E88 top: 

• When working on the rollover protection system, if rollover protection is to be trig¬ 
gered by the diagnostic system or manually by the technician, the convertible top 
must first be opened. Otherwise the convertible top will be damaged. The is also 
applies to mechanical activation of the roll over system. 

• Particular characteristics of the open and close convertible top buttons. 

-Terminal R ON while the button is being pressed. 

- After top operation is complete, press and hold the button for longer than 
20 seconds. 

A fault code memory entry may occur due to operator error: example: if the front passen¬ 
ger presses to open convertible top and the driver switches Terminal R ON. In this case, 
the fault code is saved as "not present". 

In the event that the “convertible top is temporarily out of action” message is displayed, 
the system will reset after the top has been opened or closed using the button. The top 
will then again be functional. 


45 

E88 Complete Vehicle 


Encoding/Programming Notes 

After replacement, the convertible top module (CVM) must be re-encoded. 

Window Adjustments 

The windows on the E88 don’t have to be initialized, but they do need to be adjusted to 
the body to prevent rattles, wind noises and vibrations as well as water leaks. 


Note: Special tools are needed to perform the window adjustment procedure. 
Please refer to the repair instructions in TIS for the most up to date 
window adjustment information and a list of special tools needed to 
perform the procedure. 


Positions for the Convertible Top Diagnosis 

The automatic convertible top has 10 sensors in all: 

• 8 Hall sensors 

• 1 microswitch 

• 1 incremental sensor 

These sensors detect the different positions of the convertible top as it is opening and 
closing. In order to pinpoint faults, the system must be aware of which intermediate posi¬ 
tion the convertible top is in. This helps in diagnosing the system by pinpointing the faulty 
component or verifying the fault code present. 


Note: The following pages show the diagnostic equipment in Control Module 
Functions, to monitor sensor position and activity of the convertible top 
as it is operated and stopped in pre-determined positions. Pay close 
attention to the terminology and the proper position of the top as you 
perform diagnosis.

Rollover Protection System 

The design and function of the Rollover Protection System (ROC) is similar to the E93. 

The ROC used in the 1 Series has been enhanced with the following features: 

• Ski bag option with 380 mm through loading opening will accommodate 
2 snowboards or 2 golf bags 

• 8 kg lighter compared to the E46/C 

• The use of function-inverted mechanisms is much more cost effective. 

In the event of an impact, in which the vehicle rolls over, the roll bars extend in millisec¬ 
onds and, together with the top frame, form a well protected area for the occupants.

Bus System Overview 


Vehicle Systems Network 

The vehicle electrical system on the E88 is very similar to that on the E93. 

The E93/E88 vehicle electrical systems differ only slightly by the omission or addition 
of some control modules. 


Changes to the K-CAN 

The convertible Top module (CVM) controls the convertible Top operation. 

The High-Beam Assistant is not offered on the E88, so the control unit for the High- 
Beam Assistant (FLA) has been omitted. 


Changes to the MOST 

SBX High is offered along with the Telematics Control Unit (TCU). SBX High permits the 
connection of external devices such as mobile phones from various manufacturers and 
USB devices (MP3 players, USB sticks or iPods). 


Changes to PT-CAN 

The longitudinal dynamics management (LDM) and Active Cruise Control (ACC) 
functions are not offered in the E88. 


Note: As on all current new BMW models D-CAN is incorporated to the bus 
system instead of D-bus to enhance communication on this line and 
comply with OBD regulations.

General Vehicle Electrical System 

Because the vehicle systems network in the E88 is the same as that in the E93, only new 
features and differences will be described here. For detailed information on the vehicles 
systems network , refer to ST701 training material. 

Central Locking System 

In contrast to the E93, in the E88 the glove compartment and the storage compartment 
in the center console are not locked/unlocked automatically. 

Anti-theft Alarm System 

The anti-theft alarm system in the E88 is similar to that in the E93 in terms of its basic 
functions and operation. There are some differences when it comes to interior monitoring. 

Three microwave sensors are used on the E88 for the purpose of monitoring the interior. 
The microwave sensors are connected via the DWA bus to the SINE (siren with tilt alarm 
sensor). The DWA bus is a sub-bus based on the K-bus. SINE is the master control 
module and is connected directly to the K-CAN. 

The microwave sensors facilitate monitoring of the vehicle interior also when the convert¬ 
ible top is down. The microwave sensors have a semicircular radiation range characteris¬ 
tic. By strategic placement in the vehicle, the entire interior can be monitored.

Audio and Communication Systems 


USB/audio Interface 

The USB/audio interface is available as 
an option. This interface can be used to 
connect external audio devices and stor¬ 
age media into the vehicle entertain¬ 
ment system via a USB interface. 

If the vehicle is equipped with a center 
armrest, the external player can be 
stored in a special pocket on the under¬ 
side of the armrest, where it is 
protected from damage.

Note: For more detailed information on the USB interface refer to the 
E82 reference material. 


Antenna Systems 

Since the standard locations for antennas on the roof of the vehicle or in the fixed rear 
window are not possible on the E88, the various antenna systems are integrated in vari¬ 
ous places around the vehicle. 

Antennas are required for the following systems: 

• Radio 

• Digital receivers 

• Navigation 

• Telephone and telematics 

• Remote control 


71 

E88 Complete Vehicle 










AM/FM Antennas 

Three FM antennas (FM1, FM2, FM3) and one AM antenna are switched via an FM 
diversity module and are used for radio reception in the E88. 

The AM and FM1 antennas are integrated into the mast antenna. The FM2 and FM3 
antennas are located under the rear bumper trim. The antenna amplifier for the FM2 and 
FM3 antennas are located in the diversity antenna module at the rear left of the luggage 
compartment.

GPS Antenna 

A GPS antenna is necessary for the telemat¬ 
ics function "Automatic emergency call with 
current location". On vehicles with CCC 
navigation system, the GPS antenna is rout¬ 
ed directly to the navigation computer. 

The TCU receives the position data via the 
MOST. 

The GPS antenna is connected directly to 
the TCU on vehicles with no navigation sys¬ 
tem but with BMW radio 2 and telematics 
functions. In this case, the TCU determines 
the location. The GPS antenna is located on 
the left-hand side under the roof storage 
compartment lid.

Front Seats Air Bags 

The front seats in the E88 do not have an integrated seat belt system. The automatic 
seat belt tensioner is secured to the bodyshell. The front seats each house a side head- 
level airbag. These seat airbags when deployed are much taller and are used in the con¬ 
vertible because of the absence of curtain airbags.

Seat Position Sensors 

Adaptive restraint systems were developed in order to optimize the protective effect of 
the restraint system under changing conditions. The severity of the accident, the seat 
position and the posture of the occupant are important factors when calculating the 
triggering sequence. 

The seat position sensors in the E88 make it possible to differentiate between people 
of different sizes. Within the seat's longitudinal adjustment range, the seat position 
detection system can differentiate between a small person and a larger size occupant. 
This detection system is another technical feature designed to increase the safety.

The system adapts the triggering of the two airbags to the driver's and front passenger's 
seat position. 

Due to US legal requirements, the driver's seat and front passenger seat must be able to 
detect the size of the occupant. Size is detected by the extent of back and forward seat 
adjustment. In the E88, the exact position is determined by the seat position sensors in 
the driver's and front passenger's seats. 

The seat position detection system is designed with a dual-wire Hall sensor and is sup¬ 
plied with power by the ACSM control unit. 

The strength of the current in the seat position sensor changes depending on the seat 
position and the distance of the seat position sensor from the permanent magnet.

Retraction Tensioner and Adaptive Belt-load Limiter 

The automatic seat belt tensioner is enhanced with the addition of two extra functions: 
• Retraction tensioner 


• Adaptive belt-load limiter.

Retraction Tensioner 

As with the seat belt tensioner, the role of the pyrotechnic retraction tensioner is to mini¬ 
mize any looseness of the belt in the pelvis and shoulder areas in the event of impact. 

The pyrotechnic retraction tensioner is located in the driver and front passenger automat¬ 
ic seat belt tensioner. In the event of an impact of the appropriate accident severity, the 
gas generator (6) is ignited and the piston (5) moves upwards. This moves the drive pin¬ 
ion (2) which is connected to the gearwheel (1). The rotation of the gearwheel (1) turns 
the disc (3) and the Seat belt retractor. This pulls the belt into the automatic seat belt ten¬ 
sioner. 


Adaptive Belt-load Limiter 

The adaptive belt-load limiter in the 
automatic seat belt tensioner reduces 
the load on the chest of the occupant. 

The seat belt tensioner, retraction tension¬ 
er and belt-load limiter all work together.

Adaptive load limiting works in two stages. The kinetic energy is first dissipated by the 
leaf spring (4) and the torsion shaft (5) in the automatic seat belt tensioners. Then the 
gas generator (1) is ignited, which moves the piston (2). 

The piston (2) then presses on the slider (3) which is shifted out of position and rotated 
in a predefined movement. This pushes away a retaining ring and disconnects the leaf 
spring (4). 

In addition, the slider (3) wedges itself into the automatic seat belt tensioner housing and 
the kinetic energy is dissipated via the torsion shaft (5) as the process continues. Thanks 
to the optimum coordination of the airbag, the kinetic energy from the passenger is dissi¬ 
pated more evenly over the duration of the impact. This results in low stress forces on the 
passengers.

Component Location 


The control modules in the luggage compartment are located so as to avoid the need 
for different luggage compartment trim, wherever possible. 

The hydraulic control unit is located in the right side panel of the luggage compartment 
floor. This reduces the loss of useable cargo room and minimizes noise inside the vehi¬ 
cle.
