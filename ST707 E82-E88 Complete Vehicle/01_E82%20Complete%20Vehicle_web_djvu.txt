Introduction 


Inspired by past 2002 models of the sixties and seventies BMW has designed a vehicle 
combining rear-wheel-drive, excellent handling and powerful engines with the stiffest and 
lightest bodyshell possible along with accommodations for four. The 1 Series Coupe is 
sure to pick up where the 2002 left off. 


For those of us that where lucky enough to 
ever drive the legendary BMW 2002, the 1 
Series inspires feelings of nostalgia. With the 
innovations in automotive technology and 
safety along with the experience gathered 
over the many years of vehicle development, 
one can only imagine the car that BMW 
would build today in honor of such automo¬ 
tive legacy. 

Efficient Dynamic concepts come to life in 
the 1 Series with the use of light but rigid 
body construction and a sleek aerodynamic 
underbody. Dynamic Stability Control and 
Dynamic Traction Control have been devel¬ 
oped even further for this car to ensure that 
advanced management systems deliver max¬ 
imum power with exceptional handling. 

There is no doubt that with this 1 Series, 
BMW succeeded in recreating the look, feel 
and performance of the sport sedan with a 
race car soul, for new drivers to experience 
and for enthusiasts to enjoy once again.

E82 Complete Vehicle 



































The E82 is being launched in Spring of 2008. The models available are the 128i and 
135i. The main difference between the E92 and E82 is in the area of the side sills or 
rockers panels. The doors, roof and luggage compartment also differ from the E82, with 
noticeable changes in the floor assembly and in the vehicle interior. The front and rear 
bumpers have been newly designed for this vehicle. 

The 128i will be powered by an N51 Sulev engine or the N52, 230 horsepower inline 
6-cylinder 3.0-liter engine that generates 200 Ib-ft of torque, the 128i Coupe will feature 
Valvetronic, VANOS and aluminum/magnesium block construction. 

The 135i Coupe features the N54 twin-turbocharged direct injection 3.0-liter inline six- 
cylinder engine, that produces 300 horsepower and an incredible 300 Ib-ft of torque from 
as low as 1,400 rpm. 

Conforming to BMW’s Efficient Dynamics, these vehicles will include the following: 

• Light weight but rigid bodyshell. 

• Aluminum front axle with lightweight components like hollow anti-roll bars. 

• Run Flat Tires as standard equipment.

Body 


The E82 features an intelligent mix of components. 

The front body work was inspired by the E9x design and re designed to complement the 
E82 styling. The doors were adopted from the European 1 Series. The luggage com¬ 
partment is somewhat shorter than that of the E92. The main differences are to be found 
in the side view and silhouette of the vehicles. 

All of the steel grades used in this vehicle were featured in the E90 with the aim on 
achieving comparable crash results. In addition, the E82 body offers a high level of pas¬ 
sive safety protection. 

Aerodynamics 

Aerodynamics in combination with 50/50 weight distribution and a rigid body construc¬ 
tion, contributes to outstanding driving characteristics and effective dynamics. The aero¬ 
dynamic styling is complemented by various design components. These include the 
front spoiler edge, very smooth underbody pan with specially designed cooling ducts 
molded into the bodywork. 



E82 Underbody Pan (front bumper and spoiler view)

Additionally, the underbody allows a defined flow of air to be directed to components 
subjected to greater thermal load with the use of spoiler edges and ram-air ducts. 


E82 Front Brake Cooling 



Passive Safety 

The basics for the E82’s bodyshell passive safety are: 

• High load-bearing carrier body reinforcements 

• Optimum utilization of deformation zones 

• Extremely rigid passenger compartment. 

The protection of occupants even in the most severe of accidents places high demands 
on the structure of the passenger compartment and on the deformation zones at the 
front and rear sections of the vehicle. 

All external loads acting on the vehicle are absorbed by specially designed load-bearing 
reinforcements in the floor assembly, side frame, bulkhead, roof and on luggage compart¬ 
ment partition. 

The body structure of the E82 offers occupants maximum safety while optimizing vehicle 
weight. The use of high tensile strength steel in large panels complemented by well cal¬ 
culated reinforcements results in a light but rigid and strong bodyshell. 


7 

E82 Complete Vehicle 






In the event of a strong frontal collision, optimum dissipation of forces is achieved by 
means of precisely calculated and tested load paths which absorb and distribute the 
force of impact onto several of the body components. 

The main focus is the development of an optimum balance between front-end deforma¬ 
tion and passenger compartment rigidity, minimizing the forces to the vehicle occupants. 

Ideally, in severe collisions this load distribution can channel forces towards the side 
opposite the impact, protecting the bulkhead area and the footwell through dynamic 
deformation zones at the front. The energy absorption characteristics form the basis for 
maintaining the passenger compartment structure and the prerequisite for the successful 
adaptation of restraint systems by means of a correspondingly low passenger compart¬ 
ment deceleration. 

In addition, an impact-optimized footrest is fitted. In the event of a frontal collision, the 
footrest deforms in the area between the driver's foot and the bodyshell. This significantly 
reduces how much force is transmitted to the driver's foot. 

There are three additional design elements: 

• Specially arranged floor components cause impact forces to be transmitted to the 
side of the vehicle opposite the impact. 

• The doors themselves, a reinforced B-pillar, the seats and the instrument panel 
between the A-pillars provide the stability and side structure in combination with 
the roof frame. 

• The rear deformation zone is made up of two longitudinal sections, the luggage 
compartment floor, rear trim panel, the quarter panels integrated in the side frame 
and various reinforcements. 

Here too, the primary objective is to maintain the protection of the passenger compart¬ 
ment so that even in the event of an offset impacts the doors can still be opened 
afterwards. 

Even if the vehicle overturns, the passenger compartment safeguards the occupant 
space thanks to the heavily reinforced pillars and cross members.

Bumpers 

In contrast to the E90, the E82 has new bumper trims of different appearance. 
Energy is dissipated through carriers with deforming elements. 

• Fulfillment of Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) low-speed frontal crash at 
10 km/h (6 mph). 

• Fulfillment of Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) low-speed side crash at 
5 km/h (3 mph) @ a 15% offset. 

The 135i is equipped with a trim weight on the rear bumper. This component 
contributes to an overall improvement in the overall weight distribution. 


Slide/tilt Moonroof 

The standard equipment slide/tilt moonroof is constructed in the same way as in the E90. 
Only the glass panel is slightly different due to the new roof contour. Removal/installation 
and adjustment are identical to the E90. 


Door and Side Panels 

The inner door panels are newly designed with an integrated map pocket and a new door 
opening handle. 



The rear bench seat accommodates two passengers with through-loading system. 
The rear seat backs fold down flat to enhance cargo space and for easy loading of the 
luggage compartment.

Chassis Dynamics 


Chassis Dynamic Driving Systems 

The E82 has many features in common with the E9X as far as the chassis and dynamic 
driving systems. The double pivot spring strut front axle design of the 3, 5, 7 and 8 
Series vehicles will now be used on the 1 Series. With the exception of the 135i sport 
tuned version the front and rear suspensions are inspired by the E90 design. 

Double Pivot Spring Strut Front Axle 

The double pivot system establishes a geometrical “axis” formed by the suspension 
links, creating one upper and two lower pivot points. Two lower pivot points (double 
pivot) established by the control arm and tension strut create an “imaginary” pivot point, 
that is extended further out on the wheel carrier. This design allows pivot points on the 
wheel carrier to be selected in order to effectively accommodate larger brakes. 

Additional advantages of double pivot system are: 

• Ability to reduce body roll while cornering. 

• Reduces front nose dive tendencies during severe braking situations. 

• Utilization of a small positive steering offset, which offers improved handling 
if friction levels while braking is different on both wheels. 

• Enhanced caster position, improves straight line stability at higher speeds, 
plus better steering return after small steering inputs.

Rear Axle "HA 5" 


The rear axle on the E82 is of the development designation "HA 5" and was used for the 
first time on the E90. Currently all E9X vehicles are equipped with a version of this rear 
axle assembly. 

It is designed as a multi-link independent rear suspension axle with 5 different link arms. 
The designation "HA 5" does not refer to the five links but represents the consecutive 
development designation used at BMW.

The use of five links enables free selection of the pivot axle for the design layout. This 
means that the movement of the wheel interacting with the suspension can be optimized 
without compromise under braking, acceleration and lateral forces. This mostly deter¬ 
mines all important variables such as toe, camber, brake support (anti-dive) angle, roll 
center and roll center change rate.

The large rear axle carrier is connected directly to the rigid frame side member, allowing it 
to transmit impact forces more favorably. The semi-trailing arm is a crash collapsible com¬ 
ponent (in the semi-trailing arm of the HA 5 rear axle) to ensure the fuel tank is not dam¬ 
aged. 

The braking support (anti-dive characteristic) on the E82 and on E9X vehicles represents 
an optimum compromise between comfort, safety and driving dynamics requirements. 

The placement of the axle carrier mounting points considerably lower stress and strain on 
the body with the use of relatively soft rear axle bearing mounts. Together with the double 
flexible mounting, this provides outstanding insulation against road noise and tire rolling 
noise. 


Note: For further information on the 1 Series front or rear suspension 
refer to the E90 reference material.

Minor differences exist between the HA 5 versions being used on the E9X and E82 vari¬ 
ants. The rear axle of the E82 is fitted with modified wheel hubs. As a result, the rear track 
width of the E82 has been widened by 20mm in comparison to the E9X. The extended 
rear wheel arches, combined with the wider rear track width emphasizes this vehicle's 
rear-wheel drive characteristics.

The springs and dampers differ from those in the E90 in that they have been adapted to 
the E82’s vehicle weight. The front axle of the E82 is fitted with a hollow-type anti-roll bar 
for weight reduction and a sport tuned suspension is available as an option on the 128i 
(standard equipment on 135i). 

The following steering systems are fitted in E82 vehicles: 

• Conventional rack-and-pinion steering with Servotronic assist hydraulic pump 
(vane cell pump) as standard equipment for all 128i and 135i vehicles. 

• Active Steering with hydraulic pump and ECO valve is available as an option. 

Active Steering in the E82 features the following optimization measures carried over 
from the E70 or E6x LCI: 

• Modified planetary gearing 

• New control module 

• Absence of the cumulative steering-angle sensor on the rack. 

Note: The new procedure for initializing the Active Steering (as in the E70) now 
also applies to the E82 (because of the absence of the cumulative steer¬ 
ing-angle sensor). 

Note: There is no electrical steering lock (ELV) for E82 US vehicles, regardless 
of the transmission type. 

Dynamic Driving Systems 

The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) has been newly tuned for the E82, containing the 
following modifications. 

These only apply to the Active Steering models: 

• DSC sensor: two separate units, one with and one without a longitudinal accelera¬ 
tion sensor. 

• DSC control unit and hydraulic control unit modified. 

• Extended diagnostic capabilities due to more precise fault code memory entries. 


Note: Vehicles with Active Steering; the operation of the DSC sensor is moni¬ 
tored by both the DSC control unit and the Active Steering control unit. 


19 

E82 Complete Vehicle 


New DSC Function 

At present only the BMW M models are equipped with a mechanical locking differential 
lock for obtaining optimum traction in extreme driving conditions. 



Some experienced drivers occasionally switch the DSC or DTC off, to obtain maximum 
power and maintain vehicle speed while maneuvering through tight corners. They can 
complain that without a differential lock too much power is lost through the inner driving 
wheel which is carrying the smallest part of the load. If it loses grip, the DSC reacts by 
applying the brakes to regain traction and/or limiting engine torque by shutting off injec¬ 
tors. This results in a loss of power in mid-corner. 

In order to satisfy that demand from performance-oriented drivers, as of March 2008 
vehicle production the 135i will be fitted with the new DSC function program that simu¬ 
lates the action of a mechanical limited slip differential. The system uses the typical 
BMW open type differential, but uses of an electronic intervention program inside the 
DSC module. 

When the vehicle is in tight bend, DSC applies the brakes on the spinning (inside) driving 
wheel. The torque is then transmitted to the outside wheel which is carrying most of the 
load, optimizing power and maintaining vehicle speed through the corner. The new func¬ 
tion implemented in the DSC control module “simulates” DTC without modulation of 
engine output. The DSC and DTC functions are unaffected by it. 


20 

E82 Complete Vehicle 





























































The advantages of the new DSC program function over a mechanical limited 
slip differential are: 

• It is cost effective. 

• It does not add to the vehicle weight. 

• Improved fuel economy. 

• It activates only when required and if the DSC/DTC is switched off. 

• Does not affect handling stability in DSC or DTC mode. 

• Avoids the familiar understeer tendency often found with mechanical 
limited slip differential.

Electrical System 

The electrical/electronics system of the E82 is identical to that of the E9X. 

They are identical in function and have been adopted from all previous models. 

• The IHKA is derived from the E9X vehicles and shares its concepts 
with some differences. 

• CAS3 and SBX High are used. 

• As stated on the bus chart D-CAN is used as on all current BMW vehicles. 


23 

E82 Complete Vehicle 




























Interface Box (SBX) High 



US version will receive a high variant of the interface box, (SBX High) containing 
the following functions: 

• Pairing of customer mobile phone to the vehicle via Bluetooth interface 

• Voice-activated control of the telephone or expanded voice-activated 
control in connection with the Assist/Bluetooth option 

• Connection of USB/audio interface for USB storage media. 

USB mass storage media that support one of the following standards: 

• USB Mass Storage Class 

• Apple iPod as of 4th generation. 

"USB/Audio interface" consists of the following components: 

• Interface Box (SBX) High 

• USB hub 

• Audio socket with USB interface 

• Application software on the head unit. 

The USB interface is located on the center console (under the driver’s arm rest) 
and is protected by a slider mechanism. 

Note: To prevent charging difficulties, simultaneous use of the USB interface 
and the 12V socket for charging the mass storage device is not recom¬ 
mended. Depending on the USB lead used, the mass storage device may 
be able to be charged through the USB interface. However, the power 
consumption of the mass storage device must not exceed the maximum 
level of 500mA permitted by the SBX High. 


24 

E82 Complete Vehicle 



























USB/Audio Interface 

It is possible to use USB audio players in the E82 as on, other current BMWs. Connect 
the USB cable of any device using the USB mass storage protocol thumb drivers and 
USB mass storage devices that support the "USB Mass Storage Class" standard can be 
connected. That includes mass storage devices for playback of compressed audio files 
with a USB interface such as MP3 players, USB memory sticks, etc. The system also 
supports Apple iPods of the 4th generation or later, iPod nano and iPod mini if connected 
using the iPod adapter cable (special accessory). 

When a USB mass storage device is connected, the contents of the device are read and 
the folder structure processed for display on the CID. In addition, a plausibility check is 
performed as to whether the tracks can be played by the vehicle's sound system. 

Only those tracks that can be played are displayed. 

The WAV file (Waveform) format is also supported. USB mass storage devices must be 
formatted using the FAT (File Allocation Table) file system. If more than one partition (logi¬ 
cal drive) has been set up on the device, only the first partition is supported. 

The USB mass storage device cannot be accessed if the files are password-protected or 
are subject to Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM is a method of protecting copy¬ 
right and marketing rights relating to intellectual property in digital form. If music tracks 
acquired from Apple iTunes are to be played, the iPod must be connected by means of 
an adapter cable that simultaneously uses the jack socket and the USB. The adapter 
cable comes with the vehicle and is also available from BMW Parts Sales. 



Note: The USB Audio interface is located under the driver’s 
armrest on the E82. 


25 

E82 Complete Vehicle 







With the adapter cable, the USB connection is used to control the iPod and the jack 
socket for audio playback. The reason for this method of connection is that music tracks 
obtained from iTunes are subject to DRM and can only be played on the device to which 
they were downloaded. The copyright protection prevents digital transmission of the 
music track via USB. 

If a video file is selected on the iPod, only the sound track is played. If other supported 
USB mass storage devices are used, video files are not displayed. It is only possible to 
access the files on the mass storage device using the iDrive when the USB mass storage 
device is connected to the USB interface. If the mass storage device is connected using 
the jack plug, the iDrive cannot be used to operate the device. 

The Y cable is supplied with the vehicle and also may be ordered through 
BMW Parts Sales. 

A convenient media player holder is located under the arm rest. 



Note: For more information on the USB Audio interface refer 
to the March 07 Updates reference information.

Special Features 


Special Features of the 135i 

The top model of the E82, the 135i, has the following special features pertaining to 
chassis and dynamic driving systems: 

• Xenon Adaptive Headlights with auto-leveling, and Cornering Lights are 
standard equipment. 

• Sports suspension is standard equipment. 

• 18" mixed tires available as an option. These tires provide superb grip on dry as 
well as wet road surfaces. This results in outstanding handling characteristics that 
underline the sporty nature of this model. (17” tires are standard equipment) 

• The high-performance brake system of the 135i has 338mm front brake discs and 
324mm rear discs. Six piston, fixed type aluminum calipers are used on the front 
while two pistons are used on the rear. These contrast with the standard cast-iron, 
floating-type calipers fitted to128i models. 

• New DSC program function where brake intervention at either drive wheel has 
the effect of improving the dynamic acceleration out of corners, even with DSC 
switched off. The accelerator pedal has a quicker response rate and electronic 
rear brake management is used to simulate a mechanical limited slip differential 
for enhanced acceleration out of turns.
